3,"More over-rated than ""Bridges of Madison County""","The most overrated book of it's time and genre. Schine's writing style is sophomoric, the plot mundane, and the character development---mediocre at best. Finishing it is nothing short of an absolute chore. If you *insist* on reading it--at least don't pay full-price for it!!"
1,Terrible...I couldn't finish.,By mid-way nothing had happened that was remotely interesting. The character of Helen came across as a domineering 40ish woman who had no friends (although everyone was supposedly in love with her for whatever reason) who hung out with her teenaged employees and obsessed over a ridiculous letter. I couldn't care less who wrote the letter or what happened to Helen so I gave up before wasting more of my time.
1,Not what I expected ...,"Though I persevered to the end, the book was a sleeper. It went in circles the whole way through. The basis seemed good but I thought it needed a lot more substance. The movie has to be better!"
1,clo from Canada,"Sorry but I have to agree with almost everyone. As a matter of fact, I gave up half way through. Just coudn't continue this kind of monologue. The whole novel looks like the writer has been working on her writing technics, but just kept repeating herself.... sorry, but just cannot even think about seeing the movie..."
1,Horrible,"I tried to like this book, but by page 61, I had to put it down. The main charachter, Helen, is a self-absorbed tramp and an unfit mother. She kisses people on a whim. She flirts and sleeps with anyone in town. She talks about how much she misses her daughter, who is away at camp, but I don't believe that she thinks of anyone by herself. She drops the F-bomb casually, as if that were speech becoming of a lady...which she is not. The plot is absurd. That she could be as callous and crude as she is represented to be and as popular as she is also purported to be, is impossible. This character is lewd, obstinant, selfish, childish, and impetuous. Do not pick this book up unless you admire loose women who are horrible mothers. Disgusting, and not a very funny book, either."
1,one star is too much,"It's very, very seldom that I come across a book that's so bad it actually crosses the line from 'bad' to 'evil,' but this one definitely does. Ten times my allowed 1000 words wouldn't be enough to even ENUMERATE all that's wrong with every single aspect of this booklet, let alone do details. And like all evil things, it prompts good to DO evil - for instance, it wouldn't take much for me to agree to have every copy of this wretched piece of sentimental porridge piled in Times Square and burned. Avoid it at all costs."
3,Good saucepan but you can get better for less.,"I've seen chefs on TV use this All-Clas saucier so I figured it must be something pretty special. It isn't. It's not a bad pan by any means, but it's nothing special. You can get an All-Clad 4 qt. or 6qt. saucepan for less and you'll get the same performance.A real weakness of this pan is the lid. The lid is stamped stainless steel and does not fit tightly. So if you were thinking about using this for any type of braising or steaming go with a different pan. The lid will not hold in moisture very well. But, it is a saucier and sauciers are meant to build and reduce sauces so the lid is an afterthought.It's a nice looking pan and performs well enough but you will get better value for your money with a regular saucepan."
5,Attractive and durable,"In response to the other reviewer: Although we've never bothered to measure the rack, we've used it to store three different 1/2 cord purchases. Yesterday we added a measured 1/2 cord from the same vendor we've used for several years to to the few cubic feet of wood remaining in the rack. Carefully split and stacked, it fits quite neatly.The rack itself is extremely sturdy. As mentioned before, it's on its third stack of wood. Yesterday's careful inspection revealed no chips in the paint, no bent metal, and a cover that still looks new after exposure to southern California sun, dry wind, and heavy rains. I have no reason to believe that it will not continue to do a good job of keeping the wood off the ground, dry and well-aired, and attractively displayed for many years."
2,Doesn't even fit a half cord.,"The dimensions say it all. 10' X 4' X 14"" = 47 cubic feet. A half cord is 64 cubic feet. So this rack only actually holds about 1/3 cord of wood..."
3,MAKE A MOVE MAKE A MOVE MAKE A MOVE!,"This is an allright album. I believe this album is where they got a new singer. Sounds like the same singer for the Bluebeats or maybe it is the singer for the Bluebeats?lolId say 6 of the songs on the album i really like. The others just dont do it for me, vocally/lyrically that is. The music is good though. Talented musicians. the songs with the asterix by them indicate the german(i believe thats the language) versions of the songs."
5,The facts,This book contained a lot of facts....I needed this for a CNA class I was taking...It helped me make an A on my final grade
2,Not so funny.,"I was hoping for something very funny for a friend who'd had a riding accident, but this just wasn't funny at all, IMHO."
4,Excellent detailed information on a select few WWII aircraft,"This is a encyclopedia for any WWII airplane nut. It features information, pictures, and specifications on 14 of the American fighter and bomber planes used by the Allies in WWII. Detailed facts about the development and history of each aircraft is provided. Engineering diagrams and engine specs are also provided. Multiple pictures and sketches in color and black and white are also included. The only disappointment is that not all famous American aircraft are included. (the Dauntless torpedo bomber is missing, for one) However, most of the well known fighters and bombers are included. A great table or reference book!!"
3,like cotton candy,"Cotton candy is yummy, fun to eat, and has nothing of value, but it makes you happy. This book is like that - fun to read, but a little cloying and sentimental, with the ""everything will turn out all right"" message and the newfound true loving sisterhood of the three sisters. It's pretty amusing in places, and utterly annoying in others, especially in the inconsistencies that should have been caught by a copy editor. (Did she have a cheap wedding, or a $40,000 wedding? etc.) It was also annoying that it was entirely written in first person - although there were three narrators (the sisters), they all had practically the same voice and it was easy to get confused as to which sister was ""speaking"". However, overall, a pink cotton candy tasty read."
4,Heartwarming characters!,"Senate's book is based on three sisters, Sarah, Ally and Zoe.Right off the bat, Sarah discovers she's pregnant by a a new guy she's seeing, Ally finds out the hard way that her marriage isn't picture perfect like it looks, and Zoe is stuck flying across the country to stop her whacky mom from screwing up her dad and fiance's wedding plans. Basically, the Solomon Sisters have their hands full!Each character has their own voice, which is great because I could view their experiences through each of their unique minds. I'd have to say Zoe was my fave, because I loved her detailed observations, but all sisters were completelly wonderful. This is a moving story about how life crises can bring sisters together."
3,Predictable but enjoyable..,"So I found myself in the Fort Lauderdale airport for 10 hours and thank goodness for red dress ink books. Even though they are published by Harlequin.. which upsets me more than a little bit.. these books are great for the light reading they were meant to be. I liked how the characters were complex and acted like real sisters.. (did not talk, had issues etc..).. I think if you like Charmed or other sister type shows, you will like this book.. but no pulitzers here..its pretty predictable."
2,Fluff,"Fluff, but readable. Predictable, too. How many trite story lines can we gather here? How can everything end happy happy happy? Good beach read but eminently forgettable."
5,Very Helpful,"Not sure if we're ready to move to Costa Rica yet, but the book sure gives us lots of ""food for thought."" It covers lots of subjects that a person wouldn't normally think of."
3,Didn't get what I ordered,"I placed an order for Cascade Complete gel, and I got just Cascade (NOT Complete)"
1,I think these are probably the worst you an get in the market.,"It was 2003. I wanted to get speakers so badly that I urged my brother to go shopping to an office store. We went there. There was nothing too intersting for me. My brother recommened not to spend too much money. I followed his advice and bought these, the cheapest speakers for my P.C.They wear out with time.(One week actually)Here are the things this was doing1)It makes these awful sounds repetitively when you turn them on, reboot the computer, and the get the PC going.2) Masive Static3) Awful sound signals when trying to run an application.4)When you turn the volume knob, static comes out.5) They get very loud when the knob is tuned only 90 degs!Please take my advice and buy a 2.1 speaker set. Don't be like my brother and think that bargains ae the best deals. They are not."
2,Not what I was expecting.,The books has many companies listed and gives histories but gives a generic price range. I mainly purchased this book for 1:18 scale models and was sad to see that a roughly half of my collection is not even listed in the book.
3,Almost but not quite...,"I've just seen this book at a local bookstore. I was pretty excited when I found it and started to browse. But then, I became a little disappointed! The author gives a few pages to companies like Corgi and Dinky, and far too many to Majorette. I would say that the Majorette part is almost one tenth of the book! Overall the photos are pretty good and there's some good information too.I didn't buy it, but maybe I would later, and only if I find it at a very, VERY, low price!"
3,A little too vague.,"The book is thorough and informative for the most part. It contains a lot of detail from combustion analysis to fuel injectors to emissions. Unfortunately, the book kinda dances around the point, a lot. They never really provide a straightforward answer to a lot of relatively simple terms. I found myself googling what naturally aspirated, stratified injection, and other terms meant. I guess I would have liked a little more clarity from an introductory book on a subject. So, be warned."
2,REVIEW,"The book is really hard to read. Much of the information is not explained in needed detail. Prelimenary courses should be taken or books read, in thermodynamics, to be able to understand that stuff. However, even with a good thermodynamic background, the book is hard to understand, even as a sumplement to the ICE course."
5,Excellent detail on how to increase your productivity,Bowsher has documented the steps to increase workers productivity. He spells out the problems and gives the answers. This is a must read for CEO's and Directors of Training. All the information is in this book.
1,It is cheaper at BestBuy,This unit is only $79.99 at BestBuy. I thought Amazon matched prices but apparently they don't. I told them about the price five days ago and they still have not changed it.
2,Not the best player on the market,"This was my first mp3 player and it definately was not a good choice. Here's why:When I purchased this player I was under the impression that it played both mp3s and windows media audio files. That is not the case, it only plays mp3s according to the company's website, despite the fact that the box bears the 'Plays Windows Media' logo and it is advertised as having a 'Windows Media Plugin'. The reason it is important that a player utilize wma files is because they take up half the space of a mp3 file so you are able to fit twice as many songs on the player.The case of the player feels very weak and the button that is used to skip tracks is very cheap, it feels as if it is going to break when you touch it.If you are looking for a quality mp3 player I would recommend the iRiver T180 or the Creative MuVo. They are both much better players and are only about twenty dollars more."
1,GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"This is a fantastic product - if you can get it. I ordered a 256MB DMK, but it came with a 128MB device in the 256MB box!If you order this product, check it as soon at it arrives and make sure you get what you pay for."
2,STUPID HEADSET,"I opened the box and repacked right away for a refund. I was so disappointed. Don't get me wrong. I own the MPIO FL100 and love it. The design is so sleek and chic. I'm going to get another one. The sound on the FL100 is amazingly clear. I thought I would buy another product from MPIO and this DMK looked unique - small. Ooohhh, how disappointed. The head set is like a freaking 'necklace' You literally have to put this silly thing over your neck and the earplugs comes out of the side. It's as though you are wearing an eyeglass holder around your neck and your glasses are daggling on your chest. You can't tell at all by the picture."
1,very dissapointing,"This was my first MP3 player, so I have no reffernce point, however, I was very dissapointed with this product. Sound quality was great, nevertheless, I give it only 1 star for the poor quality of the accessories, software and comfort. The earphones were too short and constantly fell out of my ears after I began to sweat. The arm band did not fit around my bicep after I started working out. The player easily slid out of the plastic belt clip and was not at all secure. To top it all off, the software/cd that came with it did not work. Overall, I was unsatisfied and therefore returned the item."
4,Impressed,"I was looking around for a portable mp3 player for a while, and mpio was the best priced I found for what I got. It was easy to install the software and get the songs onto the player. The sound quality is great. The ONLY things that could be improved is better earphones, because the ear buds they give you hurt my ears, and a function to create play lists. But still, I can use it to go running with the arm strap, or hang it around my neck when I'm walking. So, I'm overall very happy with my purchase and have no regrets."
1,run away from this product,this product stinks. i recieved one for my 21 birthday and im returning it . all it is is a hastle okay ya sure the player has style but downloading music is a task in itself i would not reccomend this product to anyone.
1,Stopped working,"This MP3 player worked for only a few weeks. The second time I tried to add music to it my relatively new Windows XP computer would not recognize the device when it was attached via USB. The MPIO website had several fixes, none of which worked. Their final recommendation was to use another operating system such as Windows 2000 or ME. It is nice and small and had good sound when it did work. It seems to be a very unreliable device based on comments on the manufacturer's website and my experience. I would not recommend it; it has been a big disappointment. The manual was very brief and offered no solutions to my problem. The website was full of grammatical errors and looked like it was translated from Korean by a translating program. I am returning it and finding another well known product instead."
4,GREAT PLAYER ! ! COOL DESIGN ! !,"MPIO DMKPROS:Small streamlined design great for pocketsEasy to use and set-up softwareBelt Clip and Armband great for excercisingGREAT SOUND QUALITY!GREAT PLAYER FOR THE MONEYCONS:No voice recorder (i wouldn't use it anyway)Doesn't Support .WMA but has a software included so you can convert them to .MP3I love this mp3 player. I was very surprised when I found this under the christmas tree this year. I was jammin' to tunes 30 seconds out of the box. A great accesory for it is the SiLink FM TRANSMITTER - - it transmits any device with an audio jack to a FM Radio.I would give it five stars, but is doesn't have .WMA capabilities ! ! !"
4,good for working out,"I LOVE the compact size of this MP3 player and use this specifically to use when working out. It is very difficult reaching customer service. I advise you to keep very careful documentation of the player; this is the easist way. The company started in 1998, so I think they are still developing their customer service department. I enjoy mine, but needed different headphones from the ones that were provided; the provided headphones were very short."
3,Not a replacement for a USB Drive,"This product makes an OK player, there are certain features I didn't like at all and I wished that some reviewers were more honest about those, First you cannot transfer MP3 Files from one computer to another, Second it requires a proprietary software to load music and files it is not a plug and play device that acts like a USB Drive. Third, not only you have to carry a CD with the program but a special USB cable for this device. The things I like were the back light feature and the AAA battery usage and the ease of operability as MP3 Player. It is an MP3 player designed for sport fans not Hi tech toy consumers that crave for multiple functionality items."
3,Handle snaps off with thick hair,"This shampoo brush does the job; however, the handle always snaps off when running the brush through thick, curly hair. While fixable, it becomes frustrating when it snaps after every other brush stroke and you have to snap it back in."
2,It works OK,It works just OK. The bristles are not deep enough and it is made really cheap for the price charged.
1,Handle WILL break,"Thats it, handle will break. There are many others out there just like it that won't.I've had several of these. They break. I guess glue will fix it but they should just make them properly in the first place. I suspect even glue will wear as you constantly use the thing in a wet environment, and it twists.Tossing them is a waste. They aren't making more oil. Buy a better constructed one, there's many on amazon."
5,I love mine.,"I bought this and I love it.That is till I told my barber and he hit me in the back of the head and gave me five of them for free.Ahem...anyway.I love the shampoo brush.This model is nice.Not as nice as free but still...it does the job.I can't shampoo without one.The feel of the massage.Sometimes it hurts if you have sensitive scalp.Use lightly, don't rake it down your head.It's meant to massage not hurt lol.Anyway, if you can't get them for free and you need deep cleaning for your scalp than I highly recommend this brush."
2,Probaly costs 3 cents to make,"Yeah, its a brush. Made of cheap plastic that feels like it will break soon. Charge a $1 for this thing....not 8."
3,Cooks great but spend all your free time scrubbing the exterior to keep nice looking,"I've had All Clad LTD pans for a number of years now. I usually cook several times a day almost everyday & although these pans cook beautifully and the interior looks beautiful, the anodized exterior looks terrible now. I wouldn't mind so much but I have them hanging on decorative pot rack. For that reason I want to replace them with the less expensive version in stainless steel but the financial loss is killing me. I don't have room in my small kitchen to put them away. We've had a stainless steel All-Clad sauce pan for a few years which still looks great and isn't embarrassing hanging from our rack. If you don't mind so much what your pots look like then these would probably be a great choice. If anyone knows any great secrets to keeping these looking great, please post them. I've contacted All-Clad several times and do exactly as they say without achieving any desired results."
1,Junk,"I have to admit, I read all of the negative reviews and purchased it anyway.This toy is a piece of junk. Aside from agreeing with the other reviewers who say it falls apart and is basically useless as a ""garage"", our particular toy came out of the box already broken. It doesn't make any sound. Unfortunately the receipt is long gone and I cannot return it to the store. Such a disappointment for my boys, too, because they were so excited by the picture on the box. But I absolutely refuse to spend money on a replacement.If you're like me and feel the urge to buy this toy despite the bad reviews, do your homework and find the lowest possible price first. I would say that spending more than [...] on this is a total waste of your hard earned dollars.My boys still play with the little cars, and my two year old gets a kick out of lifting the elevator, but I regret sinking money into something I was warned about."
1,THIS IS CRAP!,I got this as a gift for my son. It fell apart so many times we eventually just threw it away. The tracks literally just fell apart and wouldn't stay put. My son was 2 at the time and was not being destructive with it. It is a TOTAL waste of money.
1,Don't waste your money,"This would be a fun toy if it weren't for one major problem - it won't stay together. It is so flimsy and so poorly constructed that it can't be played with. It's a cute idea, and we love the Seasame Street characters, but this toy is a complete disaster. Don't waste your money."
4,21 month old loves it!,"My little guy loves cars and elmo so this was the perfect match. I bought it yesterday as a christmas gift but I was too excited. I put it together, took me a while to get it right and stable but it is possible! In fact my son is playing with it right now, kneeling on the slides and it's still holding up. Plus he imitates the characters laughs-wicked cute.I think as long as the parent/care giver takes their time to put this together right and not rush through it that its an awesome buy."
2,What a disappointment,"We bought this toy for our son Christmas of 2007. I always like to unpack the toys before we wrap them and I couldn't even get the toy to stay together. I returned it and picked up another one, and it stayed together so I wrapped it. When my little boy, then 1 1/2 played with it on Christmas, it fell apart. The ramps do not stay on, and the support legs are virtually useless. This was the same problem for both toys. Our son still liked it so we kept it, but it is really a cheaply made toy, which suprised me coming from Fisher Price. I would not recommend this toy."
3,Cute and fun but falls apart,My daughter likes to use the elevator with the toys but the ramps in the back come apart from the toy very easily and I'm constantly putting them back on.
3,Glue the ramps,"Okay, so sometimes I buy on impulse and don't research on Amazon first. I bought this for my 2 1/2 yr old for Christmas 2008.Yes, the ramps fall off.. ALL the time. I finally got out some silicone glue and glued them on. They have been on for a few weeks and my little one LOVES playing with the garage and I LOVE not having to put the ramps back on every 15 minutes.Our cars roll down the ramp fine and stay on the elevator, unlike some other reviewers.I would have rather purchased one of the other Giggle N Go sets, but since I have this one, I wanted to make it work."
1,Terrible! Awful! Piece of junk!,"Did they even test this thing before putting it on the market?! I just returned it and hope that anyone else who got stuck with one of these does too. It is so poorly constructed I don't see how they could even put this out for sale - especially for the price. We tried everything we could to get this thing to stay together, with no luck. Save your money and pass this thing by."
1,Flimsy Construction - Do Not Buy!,"I agree with everyone else, this is a poorly constructed toy that falls apart and was a real pain to put together. My 2 year old was so excited to see the box and when we finally got it together, the ramps fall off and the cars get stuck on the elevator piece because the ramps don't line up right with the elevator ""floor"". Don't waste your money! This was a huge dissapointment for Christmas."
1,The Worst Toy Ever Made!!!!!,I have never seen a toy so poorly constructed in my entire life and would like to warn everybody interested in it against buying it. Within 5 minutes of puting it together it was falling apart. All you have to do is move it an inch or two and it just collapses. How is this suppose to stand up to toddlers playing with it? I have twin 2 year old boys who lean on it drag it around and fight over it. It's no fun at all having to put it back together ever 10 seconds and that is not a exaggeration! Definitely not worth $1 let alone $30 or more!!!
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I purchased this item for my daughter who LOVES ELmo and LOVES cars so I I was very excited to get it set up for her. However, I soon found out that the cars don't fit properly on the ramps so they only move an inch or so before you have to give them another push. It also has a very poorly constructed frame - I find that the entire garage falls apart easily if moved a lot (which of course is what kids do). Just walking through the house makes the garage start talking which is pretty annoying. I inquired at Fisher Price whether this item was suppose to function this poorly or if maybe I had gotten a defective model and they couldn't give me any information on how it was ""suppose"" to work. I would definitely suggest finding another garage."
1,No good!,"I also had trouble with the ramps. Everytime you attempt to move the garage, it falls apart. It is pretty flimsy for a Fisher Price product. I contacted the company and sent the toy back for a voucher."
1,very disappointed,"we bought this for our son for his first bday. should have read the reviews before i bought it. agree with every comment how it falls apart, cars don't fit. called fisher price and they had several complaints about it so they emailed me a return label and once they receive it they will send me a check for $35."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY... REALLY!,"My boys were very excited about this toy. However, it is junk! The ramps will not stay attached. We just got it yesterday and it is going back to the store. It is not worth any amount of money. Save yourself the frustration and do not buy it!"
1,fisher price should be ashamed,"Just got this as a gift for our twin 19month old boys. We were as excited as they were - until we tried to put it together. I cannot believe Fisher Price produces such junk. None of the parts pop in as they should. Absolute complete waste of time, money and plastic. Now, we'll have to spend time calling the company to make good on the this - after reading these reviews, we'll ask for a voucher instead of the same toy. Do not purchase this product."
1,"Add a B to Garage, and you get GARBAGE","This was one of the toys we most looked forward to our 18 month-old son opening. We could NOT believe how shoddy the workmanship was. I would much rather use tools to construct something worthwhile than be seduced by the easy to set up, no tools necessary, claim of Fisher Price. We considered taking it back to the store in exchange for another one (on the off chance that the one we got was simply defective), but after reading the reviews here, we know our problems are not ours alone. Hopefully, some people see this BEFORE they spend $30 on The Giggle and Go GARBAGE."
1,Don't waste your money,"I found this on sale at Target and bought it for my then 1 1/2 year old. She liked the concept, but none of the pieces of the ramps would stay together. After a week of frustration, I donated it to Goodwill. There are so many better toys out there that I would not waste a dime on this one."
1,JUNK! JUNK! JUNK!,"The ONLY reason I give this a three star for fun is because my daughter is still playing with it and loves the voices...but she comes to me every few minutes to put it back together because it's a PIECE OF JUNK! The wheels are too big for the stinkin' cars to drive down the ramps! Come ON!! I am just so disappointed and amazed that this ""junk"" (for lack of a better G rated word)is on the market.Shame on you, Fisher-Price!"
5,As described,"Worked perfect for my Halloween party. Liked them so much that I now use them in my standing floor lamps mixed with regular bulbs. The lamps are the tall rectangular paper shade ones. It puts off a nice ""strawberry lemonade"" ambiance which is perfect for my in home bar. Good product. They all are still working 2 years later."
5,Unobtrusive Lighting,Hubby learned this trick from his grandfather: Red bulbs provide evening light without being too bright or obtrusive. They also function as ambient light during Haloween and at Christmas.
2,"If it wasn't for the music, this would get one star","Where to begin:1. Terrible story, full of plot holes.2. Dreadful acting (once again we see the same old nephews and nieces)3. Poor cinematography - this makes Emmerdale look amazing.4. Bad pacing, and weak over the top action scenes.All that is just the tip of the iceberg. Which leaves you to ask when Bollywood is going to start making films with a quality to rival that in China, could it be something to do with point number 2 above? The film looks awful, if you watch it and then watch 'Hero' with Jet Li (made ten years ago I might add) - you are left with the impression that OUATIM was made by a class of five year olds.The only thing worth this experience is the music, which is above average."
4,"Good product, not so good company","The product was just what I wanted, but when it came to getting any info from the ordering company (Lizell), it was far less than perfect. Unlike most purchases from Amazon (or from any company for that matter), I was never sent any email confirmation that the product was shipped or that the order had been received by anyone other than Amazon. When I attempted to call Lizell for information on where my order was, I was told to leave a voice message for the person in charge of orders, then never heard back from anyone. I assumed that my order was never coming, but then surprisingly enough, my order showed up just in time for me to give it to my friend for a graduation present. I guess I should have read everyone else's reviews before I ordered this product from Lizell. Could've saved myself some grief."
1,SHORT EXPIRY DATE,Ordered two of these on line when I received them I had one month to use them up before the expiry date. I had to give one away since I do not live in the US and it is rather inconvenient to return. A greater level of control should be implemented for vitamins and supplements with regard to expiry date and shipments outside the US.
2,amanda,disappointed in the movie skipped around and did not tell the whole story. was expecting more out of the movie.
1,Not exactly what you would expect,"I bought this book expecting to learn more about programming, big mistake, not only because you won't learn anything new about programming but also because the examples and problems of that book are stupid too. If you are an engineer or a student and want to try improve your knowledge I don't recomend this book, you will waste your money just as I did."
5,Internal Medicine on Call,"this book is very good for some one who needs fast practical note to handle the newly admitted patient. I read many books in Internal Medicine area ( washington manuel, Current medical diagnosis and treatment, manual of adult ambulatory medicine, mini cecil ) but non of those books gave me what I wanted to know about how to handle the patient that just arrived and I should admitte. this book gives you general but very important informations STEPWISE and you wont be confused as reading big textbooks. the chapter on lab parameter is excellent and very useful. The surgery edition of this series is 85% same as the Internal Medicine one and if you read one it will cover the other too."
2,There's better,I wasn't going to write a review but I saw this book geting 5 stars and that just seemed inaccurate. My entire intern class bought this book in 2003 and I am not aware of any of us(out of 9) using it still 3 months later. Most of us wound up buying the Pocket Medicine guide from Massachusetts General and liking it much better. That book is great for getting you through the initial admit orders and handling nursing calls in the middle of the night. Now that I am in private practice I still use the Pocket Medicine book and I can't even locate my Internal Medicine On-Call book. Fairly sure I threw it away when I moved.
5,great book...,"This text is great for its wealth of information for problems - but only for emergency on-call scenarios. (Well, that was stated in the title.) Use it only for selected encounters as it is limited in scope. Each chapter should probably be memorized at some point in your residency. Oh, and it proves a great counter weight for your stethoscope in your white coat."
5,Great book,This book is good to use additionally while taking your classes towards yr nursing boards. I like how it breaks down each chapter from med surge to CVA to wound care it's very detailed so you can jump to exactly what chapter your studying along in class
2,not nearly as good as I thought,"I'm using this to study for NCLEX and I'm getting very frustrated with this book. The study guide part of it is great. The sample questions are very bad. The answers and rationales do not match what the book is saying in the study guide part. Also, I was taught some things differently than this book. For instance, I was taught NEVER to put up 4 railings because it is considered a restraint and the patient could injure themselves trying to get out of bed. The book says to use 4 railings and rationalizes the answer by saying this is a safety issue. I think the worst sections are labor & delivery and Pediatrics. This was a huge waste of money."
2,Hard to Read,"Not worth buying. While some good directions, hints, etc., very difficult to read because the entire book was done by calligaphy. The different letter styles could be gotten in other books. Sorry."
5,The best calligraphy how-to available.,"I highly recommed this book to all my students, for several reasons. First, an amazing fact is that most ""how-to"" calligraphy books are written by bad calligraphers. Jacqueline Svaren has a good, crisp, well-practiced hand that is worth immitating. Second, the entire book is hand written in calligraphy by her and is reproduced actual size with no corrections, so you can see real-life problems and solutions (yes, there are a few cross-outs!) - this isn't retouched perfection. Third, with every letter there are wonderfully helpful notes, explaining complex shapes or warning of common problems. Finally, the book weaves in a good deal of calligraphy history, which helps the student gain a better understanding of how the forms developed. Highly recommended."
4,excellent calligraphic resource,"this is one of the books i learned out of. it's packed with great info, and everything. sometimes its hard to find it in the calligraphic layout, and some of the alphabets lack important info like nib angle. but despite its faults it's still exceedingly useful."
4,Beautiful for a Blue Kitchen,"This cabinet knob is perfect for a traditional blue kitchen. It would look lovely in hunter green with the English Ivy on it, too."
4,Get Strong,"The info and instruction in this video, if followed, will make you strong, plus it's kind of a fun workout. I had never even heard of kettlebells until recently, but I'm stronger now than possibly at any time in my life."
2,"Concept okay, but tiny book, quite overpriced.","This is a very slender book, with not that many recipes for the price you're paying.And, you can do the same thing with a large, lightweight insulated travel mug (you know, the kind that are 'way too large for any car's cup holder), saving the truly wasteful practice of throwing away plastic bags, and/or having them blow away in a brisk wind, creating yet more litter.Check this book out of the library first, before buying."
2,How to add toxins to your cooking,"I will give he author and A for creating a whole book about eating out of a plastic bag.However, the idea of pouring hot water and eating out of an LDPE (Low Density polyethylene) plastic bag is crazy.You have to notice that the plastic is starting to change and soften as you pour the hot water into it. The plastic smell from the resins is not only going into your nose, it is going into the food you are eating.What is the purpose of going outdoors for good health if you are going to be pumping polycarbons and plastic resin into your body? It makes no sense at all.One day in the not so distant future, someone will find a copy of this book at a thrift store, point it out to a friend and say, ""Oh My God, what were they thinking?!!"" It will be like seeing an old article from the 1930's discussing the health benefits of smoking tobacco."
5,Worth every penny!,"What a great little book. I do K9 search and rescue and have to be out in the woods with a lightweight backpack so it's hard to carry good, nutritious, filling, warm food. This book gives many suggestions on packing lightweight servings that are made up with just hot water. These are all tried and true recipes and easy to add to with your own extra ingredients. This book will be added to our search and rescue library so our other members can also use it."
5,Love my headrest covers!,These fit my 2009 Toyota Rav 4x4 headrests perfectly! They're just what I needed to cover up my light colored headrests to protect from hairspray and other crap from my hair LOL! They look good and they fit nice and snug. Perfect way to kick off the football season!
3,Not clear why this cost $340,"This is certainly a nicely made stockpot, but it's not clear how it cooks things any better than, say, a solid stainless steel pot that cost half as much would--or 1/7 as much for that matter (cf. the 12-qt. stockpot by Farberware). The outer 'layer' of the LTD line seems much less like a layer than like a coating; it may make the stockpot less prone to scratches, but it does not make impervious to them as mine can attest. One concern with a large stockpot is that it will not transfer heat well enough to get the liquid to boil when it is near-full; this product will achieve boiling, but not appreciably better than other, far cheaper stockpots I've used."
4,Torch,"This is the eighth in the Fred Carver series and one of the best, but then, I think they are ALL good. John Lutz is a clever writer and this series is a very good one, but having said that; Read them all, I did!!"
1,Torch,"unfortunately the book is dated. When the detective is looking around for a public phone booth to make a call, I rather lose interest. Lots of filler too, too many words to say the same thing..."
5,Very good,Very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good i buy anythink from this people
5,Awesome Family Entertainment,You will come to love the characters and this is one of the best series out there!
1,factory error?,"warning, do not purchase! this package is factory error. the third disc in this pack looks ok with correct writing on it, but when you watch it, it is actually the third disc of the first series. i know, i purchased the first and second series & this is true. i returned it in hopes that this was an isolated error, but the replacement was the same way. i don't know what to do. maybe complain to the big factory? yeah, right. i can not complain to anybody at Amazon as there is no number to talk to anybody personally. maybe i should have just kept returning the product until somebody got tired of me. my conclusion is that i have been ripped off & i love Amazon."
1,Disappointed,"I love this series, so when rating Season 2 as a whole I would give it 5 stars, if this series was purchased for me. I gave it a 1 star for the following reason. It was advertised as subtitled. I purchased this set for my deaf daughter who absolutely loves the series. I had to return this set because she couldn't watch it. Amazon, though, did cheerfully and quickly refund my money. I really hope that this problem is fixed in the future as I would like to purchase it for my daughter."
5,My wife loves the series,I bought this as a gift for my wife. She used to watch and loves now that she can get the series. The stories a good. And now my daughters are enjoying them with her.
3,missing two episodes,"transaction was smooth. package came in decent amount of time. but the the way the disc are set up, two episodes are on side a and you flip the disc over to side b for two more episodes. my disc 3 is missing its two episodes. and i looked up all the episodes of season two, and they are key episodes to the series :/"
4,Road to Avonlea Seson 2,"I love the storeies of Avonlea. I started collecting the series. After getting season 2, I noticed it was different from season 1. The CD's are different. Season one disc's are labeled and easy to read to what disc is what. The season 2 I got, only the first CD is labeled and the rest of the disc's are extreamly difficult to read. The first season I purchased is in a cardboard box and labeled first season. Part of the box is written in French and there is no flipping of the CD involved. The second season I got is in a plastic box and is labeled second Volume. Also you have to flip the CD's to view the whole CD. I now know that when I am looking for future season's, I will look for the cardboard box that is easy to read and does not involve flipping."
5,love these series,i loved watching this series. was on one summer. got into it but they only showed 1 and 2 series...would like to buy all soon.
4,"Not harem, ecchi reviews of other series mistakenly posted with this.","This is a great series, wonderful artwork, and a good plot. ****For some reason reviews of Demon King Daimo have been posted to this anime*** If you are looking for fan service, nudity, or harem action, this is NOT the series. If you want good animation, voice acting, plot, character development, with action, adventure, and comedy mixed in, in just the right proportions, this is the one."
3,Fun but Lacking,I bought this series on impulse and not that I regret buying it I wish I spent more time understanding how the anime was gonna be. If you like the slow pace-friends forever- understanding-peace- and hope. This is your show but if not stay away or watch an episode online. It a sweet anime and I gotta say I love the opening song but there is no Wow Factor.
2,Disappointing,"From the information about the book, I thought it was a complete book of Barker's fairies. It is NOT, and the images I wanted the most were NOT included. The book itself is printed with a sort of ""fake elegance,"" including a padded cover and gold edges on the paper. I would rather had had a conventional binding."
3,"A Solid, If Unspectacular, Re-Telling","In this edition of Faerie Tale Theatre, the classic story of ""Cinderella"" is retold in traditional fashion. A little bit of humor is indeed present, but otherwise it's pretty true-to-form.Guest stars include Jennifer Beals, Matthew ""Ferris Bueller"" Broderick, and Jean ""Edith Bunker"" Stapleton (whose fairy godmother is easily the highlight).The humor is nice, but the terribly wooden performance from Broderick takes some of the starch out, rendering this one good but not great."
5,Fun for All Ages!,"My two kids (ages 4 & 6) find this Faerie Tale Theatre series hit or miss - some they really enjoy and others not so much. But this one - Cinderella - is their favorite (and my favorite, too!) It's the basic Cinderella story, but the characters are entertaining and well acted. Enjoy!"
5,Happily Ever After start HERE!,What happens when you have Jennifer Beals playing Cinderella and Jean Stapleton as the fairy godmother? MAGIC!!! This is a wonderful film in the Faerie Tale Theatre series. Each actor/actress gives very memorable performances from Matthew Broderick playing the prince who is looking for love to Eve Arden who plays the unfair dictating stepmother. A perfect family film. A movie that no family or fan of fantasy should be without!
5,Great Movie,Wonderfully modernized version of the classic tale of Cinderella brought to life with wonderful actors. Great movie . Highly reccomend.
1,"this is a pamphlet, not a book","If you want an advertsing pamphlet telling the good things that can be done with MS Publisher, you'll like this. If you want guidance on how to use the program, look elsewhere. For the same money, you could probably get more useful info from the various MS Office books that devote 30-40 pages to publisher"
3,Exploring getting started with Microsoft Publishing 2003,It was helpful. I am doing a newsletter ans it did not have much information regarding this type of publication. I have used it some.
2,can not go the distance,I get very little distance from the recever and i drop the signal not for me
1,Does not work!!!11!11!!,"The claims in this book are false. If you grind up a Bible and consume it in pill form, it will NOT cure your IBS. Maybe I was confused because I only read the title and not the actual book, but my results have been just terrible. I have spent over $300 on KJV Bibles, condemned myself to eternal hellfire for blasphemy, and I STILL have irritable bowels.When I get some more money, I intend to try it again with New International Version Bibles, because I hope this will be more effective."
4,of this genre...,"which is old, maybe ancient, it's very well written. It's juvenile fiction of another age. Published in the 1920's, I can imagine that my father may have read it. I love these books, but I'm not typical. These books were published at least 30 years before I was born."
3,Not much to review,"Mine arrived rusted and looking shabby, but then again these wedges don't need to be pretty. Ran them over the wire wheel and they are nice and clean now. They really make taking the chuck off your drill press an easy task."
1,"As written, but.......","I read the description saying there is a highlight and pen notes on the pages, but as I read it the pen marks and highlights are sooooooooooooooooooo messy, there are underlined/circled text using pen but it's all wavy, broken lines, strike through the text, and there are brackets and scribbles throughout the book. I would tolerate if it's neatly underlined, and last thing is what the hell is wrong with the front page it looks like it was bitten by a dog or perhaps a person, I'm even too embarrassed to lend this book to my friend."
2,Boring and interminable...,"Fridlander tried to do too much with few available space. The result was more like a dictionary of ""who is who"" in the world of ""rock"", comitting the same errors of other writers: Dylan is God, metal is a sub-genre, (altough he reckons his importance), there is an endless stream of names and artists. He tried to divide rock into separate frames of times like doo-woop, Motown, folk, etc, when that's no true. Rock mas always made of intersections.After all, trying to analyse music is a waste of time."
2,Boring.,"About the errors subject, I can point two right now: he says that Van Halen's first album was produced by Gene SImmons from Kiss!!! It was not! It was produced by Donn Landee!! Simmons only helped the band a little bit in their beginning! He also says that Ozzy began his solo career in 1978. In 1978, Black Sabbath (with Ozzy)was recording and releasing NEVER SAY DIE. Ozzy started his solo careeer in 1980.As for the book itself, it has some good points, but in general is boring and boring and boring..."
4,The Checkered Cabs - Driving Towards Supreme Stardom!,"This album is pretty good. Although Caz's (the lead vocalist) voice can get on my nerves at times when she kind of reaches for the notes with her stomach and it sounds like a kind of bellowing sound - it's strange, but some people like it - some people don't. I am one that doesn't. This ranting noise is not found in every song though, which makes ""Darling Boy"" one of my favorites... it is a really nice song. The Checkered Cabs have paved the way for other female-led ska bands such as the Dance Hall Crashers, One-Eighty (180), Metro Stylee, The Usuals, & various other talented female-led ska(/punk) bands. Hopefully the Checkered Cabs can keep up the great work and make it big..."
5,Knock your sox off Ska,"Great debue CD. I love Ska and own around 150 Ska CD's, this one goes near the top of the list of my favorates. Great vocals, good orginal material, and wonderful covers. I couldn't beleive it when I was really getting off on ""La Bamba."" There is a strong lating/Cuban flavor to a lot of this and it really worked. I can't wait for more."
4,Bring your roadmap,"Thank you Mr. Anglin for a comprehensive review of an area often visited and seldom appreciated. Central Washington is shrub-steppe and lacks the beauty and lustre of the more spectacular pine forests of the Cascades or the Puget Sound with its rugged pioneers. However, major waterways. springs and bunch grass concentrations helped direct traffic in and around the arid wilderness of the Columbia Basin. Anglin has been thorough in his research and methodical in his presentation of the various phases of transit. His level of detail has made me reach for the gazeteer or road map many times to envision a herd of 2000 cattle fording some stream or fighting off some Yakama warrior party. My only complaint was the rather small number of maps compared to the wealth of narrative."
3,arrived on time,I havent seen any change in me at all since I been using relora but it did arrive on time
3,"Not what I thought., had tried Relora before with little results","Had tried Relora before with little results. Wanted to give it another since Dr. Oz had recommended. Even took the supplement with other items recommended,no results. Mary Jenkins"
2,Relora,Noticed 0 results...Felt no relaxing effects...Seemed to me to be a waste of my money. No way can recommend it.
5,No more insomnia,A holistic doc recommended this for sleep. He said i can take it before bed and then take it when I wake in the middle of the night and it will get me back to sleep. He was right. Doesn't take long for it to work either. I've had months and months of waking at 2 or 3 AM and never getting back to sleep. I've gone back to sleep every single time I took this. I've tried many things and this is just what I needed. Even if I take it at 3:30 AM and get up at 5:30 there is no grogginess. I feel good the next day. Energized.
3,I guess it helps some????,"Not real sure if these work as they are supposed to or it could be that i take so much other meds that i was unable to tell i was taking them. I thought at first that they were working but now , not so sure. It is supposed to help with weight loss, didn't. I took it about 3 months..."
2,Did nothing for me.,"Pros: It's cheap.Cons: It does nothing.--I know the main page of this product doesn't specifically claim that it does anything. So in that regard, I can't technically find it at fault. But, I CAN.I know most of you reading this learned of this stuff from Dr. Oz. I know many of you think that this stuff helps curb your appetite, or calms you down, or makes you drowsy. I did not feel that it caused any of these effects in me whatsoever. I did not find that it did anything at all. But at least it was cheap.----** UPDATE **I've taken this before bed at night and have noticed some differences. This stuff works like a more gentle melatonin. When I take 1-2 of these before bed, I have more frequent and very vivid dreams. I also find myself awake at 3 AM and toss and turn until I have to get up at 6:30. This is similar to results I've seen with melatonin. So, this stuff does do SOMEthing, but it's hard to quantify it as good or bad..."
2,Didn't work,I had read about this. I bought it because I have a hard time losing weight and I thought it would help but like other products for losing weight I think it depends on the person rather than the supplement
2,eh,I just finished taking these and I still stress eat and I think maybe I even ate more so than before
1,Relora,If you neer want to have a bowelk movement again than this is the product for you.This stuff will stop you up so bad you will think that a trip to the emergency room maybe necessary.
2,Worked but with consequences,"I started feeling less anxiety after taking this; however I received upper leg rashes on twoo different occasions when taking. Thought it could be a result of washing powders, but after stopping Relora the rash went away. When I started taking it again, it came back. I am sure it was nothign serious but that tells me that it does cause reactions. If you're sensitive I do not recommend. Gave two stars because it relieved my anxiety."
4,Relaxation in a bottle,"Relora was great. People told me I seemed happier and more relaxed.The only complaint I have is that it made me too relaxed. I was so relaxed that I had trouble staying up. I did what other recommended. I took 1 in the morning and 2 at night. But, the 1 alone was enough to make me drowsy.As for the weight loss aspect. I didn't use it long enough to find out. So, it's hard to say."
1,Relora,didn't like them they really didnt seem to do anything and I was even working out 6 days a week.
2,safety seal removed,Safety seal appeared to be removed from bottle & was actually stuck in cap of bottle. Bottle was wrapped in plastic but shrink wrap machines are sold to wrap products so how do I know this bottle/pills weren't tampered with?
1,No impact,This product does not appear to have changed anything with my system despite following the directions. My stomach appears to have become bloated. Dont waste your money.
3,ok product,Bought this product based on advice from watching Dr. Oz. No side effects probably beneficial if taken longer than a month.
1,Relora - Nature's Destressor?,"Once again I find myself thrwarted by Dr. Oz. His promise that Relora would curb my cravings by reducing my stress level had me hopeful - so once again I ran to Amazon to purchase my ""promised land"" remedy.Did Relora reduce my stress level? Absolutely not, if anything it increased my stress level knowing I paid so much for yet one more snakeskin oil. I think I should stop watching Dr. Oz - he's costing me a lot of money. Something to ponder."
2,Does Not Work:,"I purchased this to get some sleep, and it did not help me with that issue at all.Ended up sending it back for credit."
1,Bad product,This product does not work at all. I will never buy it again. I purchased this product because Dr Oz said it would work but I guess he can be wrong to.
5,Dis won is sick mon,"Wen mi roll wit mi bwoys in di weeken wese bounce wit log on. Dis won is massive fa real mi caant tell yu nuff. Fa yu dancehall fans must buy dis won fa if yu won massive dancehall tracks. I agree nuff with di lyrics in ""bombing"", sinse di twin towas git reckin mise ah have nuff problim wit customs. Dis cd is excellint fa if yu listen to dancehall."
3,Not a bad video for Italian class,"I enjoyed this 18 minute video. However, it seemed a bit dated. Overall, it provided my students valuable information about Christmas in Italy."
4,Very New,"It was interesting because of how normal the vampires seemed in comparison to some vampire novels. A few things bugged me, i.e. the vampires morals, but it was a great book that I would recommend to any vampire fan. Actually I plan on letting my best friend borrow it so that we can discuss it. I can't wait to read more books from her, BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,Book One: Twilight Phantasies ( 3 1/2 stars),"I enjoyed this book, but I have to say that it wasnt anything special..after reading the Anita Blake series..I feel like Im ruined for any other Vamp book because I just cant see how it could possibly get any better than that series.I will say that Twilight Phantasies had some amazing lovescenes..I enjoyed Eric very much..but I just couldnt connect with Tamara..sometimes she just acted like she was TSTL...anyways...Im definitely going to dive into the second story soon. Im looking forward to it."
5,Great Read,What can i say...Maggie Shayne is a great writer with her vampire series. If you love vampire novels then you are going to love this series.
2,Boring,"i was really excited when i got these books, but i was quickly disappointed after the first few chapters. First of all, the concept of DPI is just ridiculous; reminds me of the X-Files. And it was also convenient that the Chosen ones are all in such a short distance of each other when the story tries to emphasize how rare it is to be one of them. That concept also irked me; that only certain people could be made into vampires because they had the Belladonna angtigen in their blood. It was a bit too discriminating for my tastes. Also, the characters themselves were not that intriguing, and i found the stories boring and slow. it was a fight just to finish the book. Also the characters' physical descriptions were too alike; both had black eyes and hair. I needed a little bit more variety. This collection of stories could have been so much more haunting and memorable; i was so disappointed."
2,Does not look like photo...Bunny did not like.,"The photo is deceiving...or old. The bag of food I got was mostly timothy hay pellets- which looked discolored compared to the pellets in my rabbit's original food. The colored pieces are incredibly tiny and there are very very few in the bag. My rabbit has been spoiled with the premium food for so long that he was quite upset with this bag full of just pellets- as was I. I'm mixing it with his old food in hopes that I won't completely waste this purchase, but won't be buying again."
5,Dubravka Tomsic playing Chopin,My wife and I love Chopin and have sampled almost all cd's available -- including those by the most famous pianists. None comes close to capturing the beauty and quiet elegance of Tomsic's playing. This is one time to ignore ratings and give yourself a treat. The ridiculously low price of this cd has no connection with its quality. This has been our favorite recording for more than ten years.
4,Great for a lazy afternoon,"Okay, so it's not a page-turner. This book is a subtle treat. The author has an amazing grasp on small town life, and the people who make it so. The repairing of the 1976 Corvette shows an obvious parallel to Alison's soul.After her husband dies, Alison moves to a small town in West Virginia with her sister. The devistation of losing her partner is too much for her to bear. She finds herself unable to work, live alone, or love.When she discovers the Corvette in her sisters garage she goes through a slow metamophosis while making it new again. She learns that it is possible to go on. If the car can do it, so can she.The townspeople become her own, and she even manages to find a bit of romance. This is an excellent book with a wonderful positive message. Go out and get it."
1,Next please,"One more heavily biased volume from everyone's favourite Michelin-man double, Stuart Reid. If you have read his other books, buying this will be redundant. If you want an objective book on the subject, look elsewhere.Further, Reid very oddly and offensively attempts to portray the present British Army Scottish regiments as successors to the Gaelic clansmen - this would be like saying the Cleveland Indians baseball team is somehow evolved from Iroquois warriors. Most descendants of the Clansmen are in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, not in the UK. Reid also claims to be personally descended from a man in the ""Glengarry Regiment"", which is highly improbable as the people of Glen Garry ended up Gaelic communities in Canada and New Zealand."
1,Not again...,"For the umpteenth time, Stuart Reid has chosen to write an Anglocentric book on the Highlanders. Unless you want an intensely boring book justifying the destruction of Gaelic culture by Britain and the Clearances, do not buy this book."
2,Try it first!!,The charcoal grate spacing is much too large. The charcoals fallthrough the grate making it impossible to use. We had to drive anhour from our campsite to the closest town to purchase bailing wirefor a temporary fix in order to make it work. It was either that orno BBQ!!
5,Great book.,"This book was written by a Catholic Priest that finally discovered the incredible person behind his faith...Jesus!Manning does a masterful job of describing the personality of Jesus and our relationship to him. He had a background as a writer as well, so his writing style is really a joy to read. (much better than my writing style (that is to say I have none) see my book Christ Through Me at ChristThroughMe.com for evidence) You can definitely tell that He has a lot of wisdom and experience in His spiritual walk.This book really focuses on the love and (obviously) tenderness of Jesus. Something that I don't think many Christians understand and would do good to read about!Another thing that I liked about this book was the short exercises at the end of each chapter. To get the most out of it, remember to follow along with the exercises as He suggests in the beginning of the book!"
4,Great Resource,This book has been helpful in completing our rebuild project. The descriptions were good and difficult areas usually had pictures to guide through the process.
4,Nice reference for Aircooled VW,This is a nice reference manual for the aircooled VW owner . Very helpful .
5,THIS IS THE ONE!,This is the manual the dealer sold to repair shops to work on the air-cooled VWs. It is the only repair manual you will need. We resale the manual in our VW repair shop for our VW owners.
4,"Good reference, but could use more detail","I've found this to be a good reference, but it leaves me with a lot of questions every time I look something up. I usually have to supplement it with online research to be able to understand my repair projects correctly. I haven't purchased any other Bug repair manuals, so I'm not sure how it stands up against the others. It seems to be the most popular one out there with all the veedubbers online."
5,"If you want to fiddle Beetle, get this book","This is the official Service manual that VW of USA used. If you want do anything on your VW Type 1, you almost have to have this book. It is thick and with lots of pictures and not to corny language, you do have to a bit interestet in cars and mechanics to fully appreciate and understand this book. This book is also avaiable for other VW and other brands."
2,"Too Expensive, No Index, Not Good for the Average Joe","If you were to only buy one book on how to repair your Bug, DON'T buy this one. While it does contain a lot of information, it has several problems.First, it does not have an index. Second, it does not even have a centralized table of contents. Instead, each chapter has its own table of contents.Next, the book assumes you are working in a profesional mechanics shop, with hydraulic lifts, etc. This was made clear to me, when the section on removing the engine said to LOWER the car to 3 feet.. Shoot, I barely got the car above 2 1/2 feet with my floor jack, and that was using wood props. Also, they tell you to use lubricants that are not common, which can be substituted with a more common lubricant.If you have the money to blow, it probably is good to have this guide, as it is the ""official"" one, but I would recommend the Haynes guide above this one any day."
5,great book,"This is a must have manual for any beetle owner ,well worth the price I .was skeptical about it butg the information and details it has by far is one of the best I have seen ,thanks to THESAMBA.COM members who recomended it I now I'm able to understand many mechanical things about my car"
4,"Great info/instruction, difficult to locate subject","We haven't completely dived into any major repairs, but have referenced this book for information about fixing the horn, fixing electrical wiring that's been noodled around with and tune-up specs, etc... So far it has provided enough detail, that is easily understood. It does seem to assume some prior vehicle mechanical knowledge or experience. My only complaint has been the lack of an index....sometimes it's difficult to locate your topic. The book is divided into 8-9 sections, each section has a table of contents....but when you're looking for something small, you have to guess which category it might fall into -- then read the table of contents to see which subheading it might be under...and if you don't see it in the tables of contents, you have to scan the sections."
4,"Buen manual , muy claro.","Buen manual, complementa otros manuales del tema. Muy bien ilustrado. Posee detalles de la transmisión y caja de cambios que no son abordados en otros libros. Recomendable."
3,not car specific,OK as a general book. Lacks detail for the specific model - in my case the wiring for a 73 Karmann Ghia. Should have gotten factory book for that year.
3,Cost,Did not want hard cover book like the one I received. However the soft cover book cost more than the hard cover. Do not understand this.
2,I was totally disappointed ...,"Since I could not locate the room spray put out by Cucina under name of Fragrant Kitchen Spray, I thought this Countertop Cleaner, put out by Cucina, would at least give off the wonderful aroma that the kitchen spray did ... not so. There is no fragrance to be enjoyed by using this countertop cleaner, more like it was just weakened water spray.I would NOT purchase this again ...I would, however, purchase the Fragrant Kitchen Spray again, to use as a ""room"" spray. When a seller makes it SO hard to locate the product he wants to purchase, i.e., the kitchen spray, I tend to just throw in the towel & say ""forget it.""Nancy ThurmanAmarillo, Texas"
1,Misguiding,"On page 7 of this guide I learned that 'interesting men' is 'des homes interessants'. Then on page 16 I am told 'one half liter' is 'le quart de litre'. I decided to give up on the book at that point, and looked at the back cover to see where I might address a complaint. There I noticed, in large letters, 'Montrez-le-moi dans ce libre...' for '...show me that in this book'.This is appalling. How many more errors are there that I did not notice, or in the rest of the book? This guide is copyright 2001. Shouldn't they have got it right by now?I contacted Barron's with my complaint but of course received no response.[PeterReeve]"
5,"This is ""The Family"" re-titled...","First I want all Bronson fans to know that this movie was originally out as ""The Family"" back in the 70's! I had been looking for Bronson in ""the Family"" for a while, when a friend told me the plot of this one and I immediately realized it was ""The Family""! Why the studio re-titled it is unknown to me and I believe will only confuse Bronson fans looking for this title. The movie itself is classic Bronson fare and if you're a fan who has not seen it, you will enjoy it. Good Bronson action with witty Bronson one-liners. Hey, Telly Savalas is in it too- what more can you ask for!"
4,Italian Crime Flick with Charles Bronson,"Good Italian hitman movie boasts a good Charles Bronson performance. The climax was really unique. If you like this, then check out Revolver by the same director."
3,Dubbed Italian Segments.,"Buyer beware; this version of ""THE FAMILY""/""VIOLENT CITY"" contains segments that are dubbed in Italian. It is vary jarring to hear Charles Bronson switch from his voice to Italian, sometimes during the same scene. This version has good video quality and is widescreen 16x9."
2,Bad one for Charlie,"Charles Bronson is one of my favorites, but VIOLENT CITY is example of 70's trash at it's worst.Boring slow pacing and a ""see-saw"" action that gets old really fast.Bronson's character is so stupid acting in this film for a hitman that you wish he would get killed off himself.I love Charles Bronson... but this is one of his dud films !"
4,First 14 minutes maybe Bronson's best,"The first 14 minutes of this movie might be the best in all of Bronson's movies. The intense car chase, the white Mustang GT, the Luger! What was that, anyway, a rental car? After that, not as great. But at least we get to see the seamy underbelly of an American city (New Orleans), Charlie's acting at his best (as ""Jeff Heston""), and some really first-rate cinematography. What does he say about the violent city to Jill Ireland? Something like, ""It's always there, you just only see it when you're with me."" The rest of the movie, at least for me, was not up to the same level. But still Bronson in his prime. This must have looked great on the big screen back in the old days. Charles Bronson 40 feet high, just like God intended!"
3,hope this one's the real deal,"The original remastered version was great to see, but 1 great Bronsonline was dubbed. ""No memories"". On the VHS copy of The Family, it'snot dubbed. Also the fellow inmate's spiel about the family man whokilled his family is dubbed. Again on the VHS copy it's in his originalvoice. I hope they get the 2 editions together and come up with the definitive version."
1,MISREPRESENTED,"this is not BILLIE HOLIDAY, the jazz singer, but billy holliday. whoever that is. haven't watched it. just disappointed!!"
1,Losers,Doug is on the lookout for criminal such as Teyvon Martin. He's a convicted felon and is not allowed to possess a firearm.
5,Superlative Ms Holliday,Six mixes of a legendary dance track from the mid-1980s. This track was remixed and released as a single from Jennifer's second Gefffen album 'Say You Love Me' which included the stellar 'Hard Times For Lovers' also issued as a single remixed by Arthur Baker. Why Jennifer Holliday never became as big as her contemporaries remains a total mystery to me.
2,Dynamic Range Is Excessive On Bolero,I originally had this album on vinyl. Then I threw it out and bought the CD. I should have hung on to the LP. The first two minutes of Bolero are inaudible unless you have the volume turned all the way up. The last couple of minutes will blow you out of the room. You really shouldn't have to jump up in the middle of a piece and change the volume in order to listen to it. The other selections on this CD are okay.
4,"Great episodes, bad DVD","Season 4 is definitely the funniest. The DVD leaves a bit to be desired. The first copy I recieved was defective, but Amazon promptly replaced it. When I finally got a working copy, if you try to play all episodes you get a splash scene of all of the episodes playing at once. Funny... but really not; it is just stupid.The episodes are awesome but the DVD and the extras are garbage."
4,This is Aqua teen hunger force,"Do you like aqua teen hunger force? I do. It is childish, sophomoric, and down right hilarious! Adult humor in a child like package."
4,A whole lot of extras,"This is pretty cool. Just so you know, the Boost Mobile episode is not included in this.There are some really great extras in this set including a studio session showing the people who do the voices.Very funny adult swim cartoon. Start with volume one if you're new to it.Major drawback is the Play All feature plays ten or so small versions of every episode. It won't play continuously like a movie."
3,WTH? F!,ok...so i got this dvd set because i love the show. its nice to be able to watch any episode i want to whenever i want to. BUT...this volume seems to have been rushed onto the shelves. now correct me if im wrong...but...ive tried 2 different dvds and they both do the same thing. when i hit the play all button...all episodes literally play. in 13 little boxes on the screen. is this some kind of joke? or did they in fact send out a bad batch of dvds? both of mine were like this and the frustration alone for having to select a new episode every time one finishes is enough to drop it down to 3 stars. if noone else has this problem....ill have to buy antother one. buyers beware.
4,"Great show, classic episodes, HORRIBLE format.","This is probably my favorite show of all time and these episodes are some of the funniest that they've made. With that said, if I had bought this brand new and paid more than the 7.50 or so that I paid for it, I would be ultra mega PISSED. I absolutely can not stand finding the remote every freaking 12 minutes. I'm trying to sit back and do what most aqua teen fans are most likely doing while watching this show, and instead I have to stop what I'm doing, get the remote again and push play, and not once but twice because they have a second menu asking if you want the commentary. So incredibly annoying. My suggestion would be to buy this DVD so you'll have these great episodes, but do NOT buy it new. Buy it second hand here or at a second hand DVD/CD store."
4,I have all the seasons and this was is just as good as others,"they are all funny, if you like athf get them. but keep your eye out. I usually save them in my cart, like all the seasons of a show (south park athf etc), then when I log in it will tell me when the price has gone up or down. most of you know I am sure but I always wait til they are cheap. I got a few of these for like $12 or something stupid cheap."
4,Alpha Teem Humbug Farce,"Excellent. Recommended if you like cartoons, hilarity, and amazing action sequences (not really). Play All gag is funny the first time, but now I just wish there was a ""Play All"" feature that played them all one at a time. (That dropped it down to a 4 instead of a 5.) Particularly funny to me is the episode titled ""Gee Whiz."""
5,AMAZING...beats Vol. 2 and 3,"First off, what can I say...I love this season. I've bought the 3 previous volumes, and with the possible exception of the first volume, this is the best.YES, THIS IS THE SPACECATAZ SEASON.Overall:Episodes: 10 out of 10. Excellent, with such classics as ""Dusty Gazongas,"" ""Little Brittle,"" and ""T-Shirt of the Dead.""Special Features: 6 out of 10. The extras are a little better than decent...I liked the segment where you can see the voice actors recording the voices of their characters (Meatwad and Carl are the same person!). Whatever you do, DON'T press Play All...it plays all episodes on one screen at the same time, which actually kind of bothered me, you have toclick play on the menu for each episode to start.FINAL: 8.5 out of 10 - If you are an ATHF fan, this DVD is definitely for you."
5,Funnier every season,"As the fourth installment in the aquateen volumes, you'd expect a bit of repetition and ""fouling out"" on the jokes. But volume 4 doesn't disappoint. The show seems to get funnier every season and I for one, am excited that Adult Swim and Williams Street has decided to keep this show around (as is not their normal way of letting a show hit hard and funny then cancelling it before it stagnates) And for all the content you get, these volumes are well priced. A good value for some great laughs."
3,Lack of PLAY ALL function is disappointing,"I won't comment on the episodes, as if you bought the dvd, you've seen the show and already know if you like it or not.I am HUGELY DISAPPOINTED by the lack of a 'play all' function. You have to play each episode one by one. The 'play all' option, as others have said, causes all episodes to play simultaneously in 13 tiny boxes. It was ridiculous for them to waste the 'play all' option on their cute, annoying little 'joke' as there is additionally a 'play none' function added that does the same thing.The content is great; the setup sucks."
3,Aqua teen,"I love the Aqua Teen series and I've been watching for years. This set has a lot of great episodes on it,some of my favorites Like Tshirt of the dead and video ouija But the commentary tracks are just garbage. They decided to record the commentary during a really loud really annoying party...They could not have picked a worse time to record a commentary for their DVD. I'm giving this a 3 star review primarily because of the lousy commentary track. If You're not a big fan of watching dvd's with commentary then this is a solid 5 star set...well 4 because there is no actual ""play all"" option. The show alone is great."
4,Moonanites,"Good DVD with no problems, and also very good for the price.4/5 because other aqua teen DVDs have better episodes, but the moonanites make it really good still."
4,"Awesome episodes, flawed dvd","This is my very 1st review on this website. i own all the aqua teen dvds.this one has awsome episodes. my favorites are video oujia, edork, geewhiz, and dusty gonzagas. but the commentaries are the worst in the series. the play all feature plays all episodes at once which is messed up. it still doesnt change the fact that this is a great dvd. long live the aqua teeeeeeeeeenz!"
3,aqua team,"This show is ok and its kinda funny sometimes, but its one of those shows where you kinda get bored and want to watch something else. I defenatly recomend the 1,2,and 3rd season."
4,Good Season not as good as season 1,This is a pretty good season way more violent than past seasons but it still is good. The best episode on this DVD set is the diet episode its hillarious!!! anyways this is a pretty good season but its way not for begginer fans its more for the people who have all the other seasons but want this one kind of thing. Its good for the price but Season one is to me the best season. Great season but some of the episodes get pretty boring4/5 Stars
4,All but a few are good,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this is one of the best shows on television but they need to let go of that ""M.C. Pee Pants"" and ""Little Brittle"" Crap. They should have Ol' Drippy come back or something like that, or that Onion Spider guy from ""The Shaving."" I prefer seasons 1-3 to this one."
3,Aqua Teen Hunger Force Vol. 4,The only thing about this set that made me want to return it was that stupid PLAY ALL joke. it's not funny and i hate having to stop to press play on each episode. Sometimes i like to just have a show running in the back ground while i work and this making doing that with this DVD set impossible.
3,Enjoyable but...meh.,"Dear Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis, thanks for the truly hilarious and clever 'play all' feature. I mean it. I really love it. Can you guys put out special editions of the first three DVDs with this feature? Paalease?Yeah, anyway, overall this is the worst of the four DVD releases. Most of these episodes rely too heavily on violence and over-the-top visual gags as opposed to previous classic episodes which get the laughs from brilliant dialogue. The pacing is also really slow and all the characters seem more on edge and PO'd.I would actually NOT recommend this DVD. Maybe, if the individual episodes were really good then having to go back and forth to the menu and click on individual episodes to play them would be worth it, but they're mediocre, which makes the play all gag an even bigger pain."
3,"Great Episodes, Poorly Designed DVD","My complaint with this DVD set is the same as the bulk of everyone else here. With no option to ""Play All"" of the episodes consecutively, I find that I essentially paid for a DVD that will sit on my shelf unwatched. This is particularly a shame because this volume contains so many classic episodes. But, I'm not going to select every episode manually just to watch it. Watching DVD's shouldn't be a chore, they should be a source of entertianment.Don't get me wrong, I get the joke of how when you play all, it plays every single episode in 13 small boxes, but past laughing once, the humor was gone, and the annoyance set in when I realized that there was no way at all to just push play and let the episodes play from start to finish, one after the other.DVD FAIL!"
4,Best that Adult swim has to offer and thats saying alot.,"I love all these dvds. My only complaint with volume 4 is the fact there is no play all feature. If there is secret way to make it work, please help me out."
1,Play All Feature Doesn't Work,"Nothing is more annoying than a gimmick in a DVD set that decreases functionality in the name of giving its producers a laugh or two. To spend money on a set that features 15-minute cartoons to find that it has a useless ""play all"" function is really a returnable flaw -- Anyone who likes this show is usually inclined to sit back and chill with friends and watch the episodes one on top of the other. Here, when you hit ""play all"" the screen breaks into 15 or so picture in picture boxes in which all the episodes begin playing simultaneously to a cacophony of sounds, rendering it of course useless. So, one has to go bakc to the menus every ten minutes to cue up another episode. This disrespectful treatment of their paying customers should stop prospective Cartoon Network customers from giving their money to an organization that would rather amuse itself than provide good service"
1,No play all is ridiculous...,"I recently picked up the fourth volume of Aqua Teen to complete my collection. I click play all see the wonderful joke they put in smirk and say to myself, ""cute."" I then go about searching for a way to actually play all the episodes back to back. When I realize that there is none I go online to see surely that I am wrong. Lo and behold I am met with dissapointment but also rage at having purchased an inferior product that constantly will remind me of its mediocrity everytime I pop it in the dvd player.I would like to congratulate you on not only failing to put in the most basic and essential feature of a TV show dvd, but also inserting a stupid joke that draws attention to your failure to do so. I am glad you feel the need to essentially spit in my face as a paying customer.Thank you Adult Swim for ensuring that I will never purchase one of your DVD products again."
3,A Mixed Bag,"Like any collection of short subjects, this one has some parts that are far better than others. A few are favorites that I've seen many times; others are rather dull. All are original. After all, anything beats another Hollywood comic book sequel, right? And you have to give these film-makers credit for trying to do something different. If you enjoy this, then please check out Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation."
1,The Willed vs the Felt,"A remarkably self-indulgent first book by a writer too old to be this immature and irresponsible with the language. All formal flair...and very little else. Clover DOES experiment wonderfully and fascinatingly with the surface shimmer of his subjects, but this kind of willed approach to the making of poems results, too often I think, in work that borders on the offensive. (A meditation on the Holocaust, for example, becomes a light-hearted, witty exercise in form.) This is a major award--the Whitman--and likely to make Clover's career. Hopefully he will earn the coming gush of praise with a more deeply felt second book."
2,Confusing? Most certainly....,"This is the most confusing book of poetry I've ever read. I couldn't follow any of the material. However, I very much liked the sound of the poetry. If you like sound and don't care at all about logic, this could interest you. Otherwise, steer clear!"
2,cordless???? i guess not...,"well im no bears fan but i would love to own the green bay packers addition of this controller, but two things keep me from doing so. 1st of all on mad catz web site, the price is for $40...way too much, and 2nd its not even cordless....i mean who want to go back to playing with cords again???? not me."
1,Waste of Money,"Looks like metal box, right-WRONG. It's a cardboard box with plastic imitation metel glued on the outside. Three aluminum rails on the inside. Go ahead and buy it so you can WATCH your expensive cd collection fall all over the airport floor when it breaks apart and HEAR the people laugh.""You paid HOW MUCH FOR THAT! Yea I bought it and it's too late to get my money back. Guess now I'll see if I can get free super saver shipping on some DUCT TAPE."
4,WooHoo,"Product is great, it is hard enough to protect yet light enough to carry around fully loaded. I has excellent capacity and the sleeves work nicely. Only problem I found is that they only give you 25 double-sided sleeves to start out with and add the rest as a ""bonus"". With $9 shipping you get the rest of the sleeves."
2,"Badly written, fails to deliver.","The writing was awful. The book was unintelligible unless you were already extremely well-versed on the subject: the exact opposite of what a primer like this should be. Turnbull spent the pages coming up with clever turns of phrase that sacrifice history for cleverness, when he should have been delivering clear, concise, helpful information.Dear Mr. Turnbull: Good writing does not have to be witty. Please just write a good book with lots of information that makes sense, like you used to do."
3,Review,"This was a gift, so I don't really know what it does, how durable it is, how educational it is or anything. Mostly this is here because Amazon keeps emailing me to review this product."
2,Traditional Bluegrass type songs,"If you like the ""Normal"" bluegrass type songs, lost love etc. Then you might like it. I was looking for gospel stuff when I bought it."
3,Tasty but MESSY!,"I bought these for my puppy as a 'chewie' that would keep him occupied for a bit after we leave in the morning. I cut/broke each strip into four pieces so they would stretch a bit more, and they were just the consistency that I was looking for.The strips are thick but bendable pieces of ""meat"" and they smell strongly! The puppy was after it the second I unwrapped one.HOWEVER...they seem to have coloring in them, because it stained the carpet pink pretty badly (not to mention the dog's white paws >>). Luckily I noticed, and the staining is the only reason these treats get 3 Stars.So unfortunately they will be good treats only when he's being supervised on top of his blanket, but they are a good one for that!"
5,The Best Red Sox Book,"This is by far the best Red Sox book I have ever had. It has information on all the Red Sox great teams, plus information on all the Red Sox legends. This book is a must have for any and all Sox fans."
3,Amazon description not good enough!,"My rate here is not for the bible but for amazon, they didn't make a clear description for this item. It is a great bible, but not for me. This is a catholic bible, it has more books than the other Bibles. If you are not catholic you may not like it. I have to return it because it's not what I'm looking for. There is not enough details that explain what kind of bible it is. But again the bible is great very easy to understand, side by side verse make it easy to compare and learn the other language."
4,suzuki struts,No problems fit perfectly and work well.Created a Stable ride.Much cheaper than i could buy locally and same product and manufacturer.
4,Comin down BLAZED...numtumbot,"Maan, been a huge fan of the reg version of this album since it came out....but i finally decided to check out the slow3d N' throwed version. Some very nice chit here, very chill. It def. ain't screwed, but it's still pretty good. So if ya feelin the reg version and ya like ya music slowed down......pick this 1 up. Jammin' man RIP Pimp C"
3,Vamva Version,This is the Vamva version of the greek bible. The speaking is fast. (It appears to be a modern greek language version)
5,will be huge,"awesome songs, great vocals. Good to see there is still great rock n roll out there. This band will be well known soon"
3,maxims very good. kindle cant edit,as always maxim delivers a sound well rounded tale. unfortunatly kindle bungles the editing... again. lost words. misspellings. blank pages. you are better off buying the book or try the library.
5,Bannerman' Ghost,"I would definitely like to say that the Bannerman books are above all my favorite. They are very, very difficult to put down once you start. And the intensity of the stories doesn't stop there. At the conclusion of the books, especially for me in Bannerman's Ghosts, all the lives of the characters come together, and the problems in the characters hearts and minds begin to resolve, and thats when the deep emotions set in. Those deep emotions come from John Maxim's excellent way of telling a story, as well as his thorough understanding of surviving, and the humanity in all of us looking for the perfect ending, once we have survived."
4,Weak on Obstetrics Gynecology,"John Maxim writes a great thriller, and I love all the characters in the Bannerman series, but his Obstetrics and Gynecology ishorrible. None of it makes any sense. Just ignore the diagnoses, and the story is great."
1,Bottom of pot raised in center,"I am very dissapointed with this purchase. The pan is defective. The bottom is like a little hill. It is higher in the center. I need lots of liquid in the pan to reach the center. It was too late to return to the shippers by the time I used it and noticed the problem. All Clad would be willing to look at it if I paid to ship it back to them. I was told I'd be without the pan for quite a long time. I'd need to purchase something to replace it while I waited for it to be returned or for a new pan. I also hate to pay more money for defective merchandise when All Cald wouldn't tell me if this is how they are now made. A local kitchen store says some of the pans come in like that, some do not. Next time I will buy from the local store where it won't cost to replace a defective item. All Clad seems to need much better quality control. Buyer beware."
2,Didn't hold up well under wet weather,"This is a portrait layout scorebook which IMHO isn't as user-friendly as a landscape. It is helpful if you have large rosters and there is a continuous batting order (little league), but that's about the only plus I can see. The boxes are almost too small to use. The printed page ink ran in the rain, and the pages don't dry out very well afterwards. If someone opened the book to a blank page and the page got wet to any extent, it was unusable even when dry. Maybe some people like this style and brand, but I think there must be better."
4,"Great song, good B-sides","'Island in the Sun' is an excellent pop single. The song is much less aggressive than 'Hash Pipe', but it features an equally catchy riff. The B-side 'Oh Lisa' is a decent generic green album leftover track. 'Always' is the highlight here, a rare weezer ballad (the only other one I know of is 'Butterfly') with a McCartney-ish melody and some Harrison-ish guitar work a-la 'Here Comes the Sun'. It's also a green album leftover, and would have been good on the album to cut down on the monotony. A longer version of 'Always' is available free at weezer dot com."
5,LIFE CHANGING,ABSOLUTELY LIFE CHANGING AND THE NEXT AND FINAL STEP ON ANYONE'S SPIRITUAL JOURNEY.GET OUT THE COLORED HIGHLIGHTERS AND START USING DIFFERENT COLORS FOR THE DIFFERENT TIMES YOU READ SOULTALK THROUGH COMPLETELY.LET THE JOURNEY BEGIN!!
5,great!,"My spirit immediately responded to this book - great book i wish everyone would read this and apply it to relationships and their walk with Christ. Feeds the spirit with the truth that Christ lives in us and can and does speak through us. Best advise i have read or hear on how to hear, speak, feel, and do what the spirit is leading from God. Thank you Larry for writing it."
3,Great set as always - but mixed up?,"As I was watching this and recently finished it, I noticed a LOT of the episodes were out of order. Like the one where the Quintisons brought back Optimus Prime, and the narrator says at the end ""Find out in the next Episode - The Return of Optimus Prime!"" - whiche if you look, will be on the Season 3 Pt. 2/Season 4 DVD set. Which is really messed up.That is the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5. They mixed alot of episodes up."
4,Rhino finally got it right,"I won't say this has no errors in the remastering, Rhino did screw up with some of the openings to ""Five Faces of Darkness"" the original broadcast masters all had the alternative opening and not mixed the way it is on the DVD. But overall can't complain, they finally gave us the option of listening to the original audio instead of the terrible remixed versions with so-called enhanced sound.From a retro point of view watching the newly remastered video and being able to hear the sound the way it was I can't complain...too bad they waited so long to do this as Season 1 & 2 were pretty messed up audio wise.I recommend this over Season 1 & 2 as it contains less errors and features the original braodcast audio soundtrack w/o those awful added in sound effects, bad mixing etc."
4,SEASON AFTER THE MOVIE,OKAY SEASON HERE HAD SOME BAD EPISODES ON THIS LIKE CARNAGE IN CMINOR BUT SOME GREAT EPISODES LIKE 5 FACES OF DARKNESS 1-5.GET THIS SEASON TO COMPLETE YOUR TRANSFORMER SET
1,Not worth your time,"If ever there were a case for not judging a book by its cover, this is it. I purchased this book thinking that its title suggested an interesting dilemma in the modern evolution of health care, but all I got out of it is that John Lantos is someone who likes to see his stories in print. The more I read the book, the more I started to wonder why I was reading it. If you value your free time as much as I do, don't waste your time reading this book--you can get as much mental stimulation watching Springer"
1,Nice and sturdy BUT....,"As with the other reviewer, am pleased with the construction and look but - again there was no adjustable follower included as stated in the product description. Won't bother sending it back due to the fact that more than likely any other Globe-Weis storage case will be without the follower also. Once - an easy manufacture oversight, twice - they don't put the follower in any of their cases. That's too bad. As a writer and liking to keep my notes cataloged the 'old fashioned' way, I won't be purchasing this Globe-Weis item again for my overflowing card needs.UPDATE: 2 hours later....handle broke off box while sliding inside box out. Not a negative person but don't bother with this! Back to the drawing board (or rather...the search for a useable index card file box! You wouldn't think it would be this hard....geez!)"
3,Too Much to Handle,"Love the LTD series, so when I saw this at a great discount I grabbed it. Unfortunately, although I'm a reasonably strong man, I couldn't manage it. For me, a pan this size needs a second handle."
1,Opportunistic psychobabble,"Anti-singles (i.e. see me for p$ychotherapy) analysis of bachelors over 40. My view was confirmed after reading the introduction section in ""Men Who Never"" by anthropologist Marian Howard who writes the same critique of a Waehler paper presentation."
2,Don't bother with this book...,"...beyond reading a critique of it at The Martian Bachelor Science Page.Synopsis: We're still waiting for a decent book on this subject to come out of an industry which bends over backwards catering to female tastes, while all but ignoring men. The book would get one star if it were not for an occasional glimpse of wisdom in it and the author's stated goal of exploding stereotypes (which he unfortunately then seems to go on to strengthen). Tries to be caring, but is acutely devoid of humor or any sort of real social context. Much of the psycho-jargon is opaque. . .need I continue?* ChrisMeister"
4,Great for the price! It works well!,"Good product, has served me well with fry (I have over 50 platy's and guppies ofall sizes).I personally never used the separator to separate 2 birthing fish, as the space is truly confining even for a small live bearing fish.Instead what I did was place the breeding trap in a ten gallon tank (with no fish in it). Then I put several females in the breeding trap that were about to give birth (without any separators). So then, when the fry was born, they would fall out of the trap through the bottom slits and into the rest of the ten gallon.The mothers were then removed and put back into their larger original aquarium.The fry are thriving in the ten gallon and growing larger everyday.For the price this is a great breeding trap.Would recommend!"
3,Average Function,The parts in plastic float and get out of place. Fry goes trough holes. Not easy to manage when trying to fix to the border. But many Fry survive.
1,What a disappointment!,"This book must have been so easy to write - virtually the same set of words on each and every page. Why not simply say try to cut down on caffeine, carbonated drinks, alcohol, chocolate, cigarettes and refined sugars? I had already cut out the above, so the book was no good for me at all. I was looking for recipes and advice regarding the foods I need to eat to help reduce my symptoms - but the book contains not a word about healing foods! The book will be useful to stumulants addicts only. Very amateurishly-written, too, I might add."
4,A Blessing With Flaws,"There are two schools of thought in the fibromyalgia universe: (1) Mask the pain and cope or, (2) take charge of your own health. If you belong to the first school, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! The book is poorly documented and as such, asks you to make an incredible leap of faith based solely on the author's personal experience. If you are of the second school, BUY THIS BOOK! As a former distance runner, I was already a believer in the inherent power of the changes the book promotes. It just helped to reawaken them and it guided me through those first, tough weeks. In that sense, it was a blessing. Former workaholics and former athletes, go for it. Others, steer clear until you have spent more time studying natural therapies."
3,This book needed a proofreader,"Having been newly diagnosed with fibromyalgia, I have gotten almost every book available on the subject. I like the idea of this book more than the execution. It has many many typos and mistakes in it and seems rather amateurish. There are good ideas in it, but over all, there are better books out there from which one could make their own ""cookbook."""
5,Joy! Joy! Joy!,"I must tell everyone how much good this book has done for me. Since purchasing it two months ago I am much improved. I've had fibromyalgia for seven years, so this was just a fantastic discovery. And it is so very easy. At least 75% of my muscle pain has stopped. But perhaps the single best result from the book is that the shear joy of living is gradually returning! Thank you Mary Moeller."
1,this book sucked. A definite waste of money.,"It basically tells you not to smoke or drink caffeine and wants you to log daily your habits. You can buy a yellow notepad for a lot less money, and that would be my advise over buying this book."
1,This book was definately not worth the money....,"The title was misleading--not a recipe to be found. It was not even a very good journal. Suggesting even one cigarette a day is too much, and not a very healthy idea. For a good book on Fibromyalgia contact the Arthritis Foundation, they have an excellent one."
1,Wierd knife,I in my hole life have never seen a knife as stiky as this.Whatever poor person bying this is going to be helpless in the wildderness.Bad every day knife.
4,Very Good Knife,"This is a great knife. It is very sharp and the serations help a lot. I am using this in a saltwater enviornment and this is NOT the type of knife to be left in your tacklebox or on your boat. It rusts too easily for that. You need to wash it frequently to fend off the rust. The Blade Launcher system works great. If your looking for a junk knife to stach on your boat, this is not it, but if you are looking for a high quality knife that wont empty your wallet, this is it."
3,"sharp, but too sticky","Yes, I agree with the other 1 star review. after about 3 days in my pocket this knife was too sticky to open all the way with the launcher, without a little extra wrist flick or thumb action. maybe not a big deal to some people, but i think its no fun. I tried oiling it, and even loosened the screw holding the blade, but nothing fixes it."
5,great knife,great knife for the price i use it in salt water all the time and has held up pretty good ! thanks amazon
5,Great Knife,"The blade launcher works, it was very sharp out of the box, and the clip is removable. Works very well as an every day carry knife."
4,Nice price for a small servo,"Seems like a great little servo so far, handles a good amount of torque (3.7 kg/cm) and comes with a decent variety of gears and screws. Please note that this has a 180 range (for some reason I assumed it was 360 and didn't check the specs online before buying)."
1,What did I buy this for and did not get?,"No Bubble Bobble, absolutely useless. I assumed that, because the Nintendo DS version had it, that this one would as well. For unimportant reasons, apparently it does not. I paid less than $10 for this product."
2,Nothing New From The Action Front,"We've seen this before, haven't we? Do we look excited, surprised, amazed?All I've got to say is: This is a typical American action movie. And its ending (punchline would be too big a word) is far from unpredictable - you figure out who the bad guy is about ten minutes after he appears for the first time. Easily.Wesley Snipes plays quite alright, as usual, while Tommy Lee Jones is mediocre. Jones always plays exactly that one and the same role anyway, is this all he can do?"
4,Great action/adventure movie,"Yes, we all know about the spin off from The Fugitive but this film stands on it's own as a great movie. Tommie Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes are great adversaries. Morton Downey Jr. is a great addition to the cast as are several other established and up and coming actors. See the movie. You will not be sorry. But watch it all because you might not appreciate it fully if you only view bits at a time."
3,Tommy lee Jones...works for me.,It's a nice little showcase for Tommy Lee Jones. Cranky Grumpy and not having any fun here. Given Wesley snipes to run to ground. Who really cares if he's guilty or innocent? We just wanna watch Mr Jones.
4,I thought it was great.,"I thoroughly enjoyed U.S. Marshalls. I rented it and am now going to go buy it. Tommy Lee Jones is great, as usual."
3,"But I thought it was called ""The Fugitive""?","There is nothing quite as exciting as when a movie company has a surprise blockbuster and then attempts to make a sequel without actually coming up with a new plot, story, etc. U.S. Marshals is a sad sequel to the surprisingly good movie the Fugitive. U.S. Marshals relies heavily on Tommy Lee Jones incredible acting ability and the well liked character he created for the Fugitive. Wesley Snipes is adequate but in his defense, the role he has does not give him a great deal of room to develop.In a nutshell, U.S. Marshals is an alright movie and not too bad a watch. It simply has the unfortunate luck of being the sequel to a rather great movie and thus has a higher standard to achieve."
3,A Man For All Sorts of Films,"The film is okay. He had some solid support. Tommy Lee Jones can be as good as his role. He was okay. He was far better in the film, Men In Black, and simply superb in No Country For Old Men. Give him the chance and he rises to the occasion. He's also quite versatile and played in all sorts of films. It can be disconcerting at times to his fans. Sometimes they can only one like a certain sort of movie like action-adventure flics and they only catch one chapter to a fine career. With a bit better script the film, US Marshalls, would have received a better rating. Fortunately the acting saved this film from complete obscurity."
3,Falls a bit short...,Supposed to be a sequal to the amazing movie 'The Fugitive'...it falls a bit short in comparison.Tommy Lee Jones is still as sassy as ever in U.S. Marshals - but it's a bit too predicable.Still has some good suspense - which I do enjoy.
4,It's not really THAT bad.......really!,"People keep saying this movie sucks because it doesn't match up to ""The Fugitive"". Well, it doesn't; let's get that out of the way now. But that doesn't mean that it isn't a decent film. The highest points for me were the sequences with the whole ""team"" of Marshals, so to speak. The chemistry between Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) and his cohorts makes those scenes particularly fun. Snipes and Joe Pantoliano--whom you may remember from ""The Matrix""--also give good performances. The downsides are--as everybody else will tell you--an occaisonally overwritten script, and a conclusion that makes you think--not in a provocative way, but in that you didn't understand what the hell happened at first. Nonetheless, ""U.S. Marshalls"" is an above average film worth seeing at least once."
4,"Searching every outhouse and doghouse, part two!","This film is the follwup toThe Fugitive [Blu-ray], but this time Tommy Lee Jones is the lead character as US Marshal Sam Gerard .If you enjoyed The Fugitive, give US Marshals a spin, it's almost as good!The PQ, and AQ of the blu-ray is pretty darn good, also included are a few great extras.Recommended!"
4,GOOD CHASE THRILLER,"I'm writing 11 years after the film's release on DVD and somewhat longer than that since I saw The Fugitive. Unlike many of the earlier reviews, therefore, I did not have The Fugitive in mind as a comparison with this one. From that perspective, it is not a distinctive nor a distinguished film but is a good one to occupy a couple of hours. Predictable or not, the action is plentiful, the suspense not intense but present, the lead characters well played and the movement rapid enough so as to to make you wait for some action to interrupt the talk. Jones is a bit more irritating than when in a top vehicle but plays his part well, Snipes is not given much time to develop his character but also does well, the others are up to par with a couple coming through with more impact. All in all watchable and forgettable."
4,"Very predictable, but good nonetheless","US Marshals picks up a few years after the original film (The Fugitive) ended, and sheds light on US Marshal Sam Gerard as he is called to bring in a fugitive accused of murdering two federal agents. Could this be another case of mistaken identity as was the case with the first film?Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes, Robert Downey Jr., and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well (Tommy Lee Jones is once again amazing in his respective role!).Overall, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good.In short, US Marshals is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment."
3,US Marshals,A decent follow up to The Fugitive. A little hokey but I enjoyed it. Picture and sound quality were awesome.
2,This is your Fugitive on drugs...,"Which way'd everybody go?!! Who's after whom,--forget why! Is cocaine contagious?...can one person take it and everyone around him become confused and run down? I think that's the message here. I really do. I think! (?) Bound to be a best seller, of course! I personally don't like working this hard at being entertained."
2,So painful,"I only give this movie two stars because it has Tommy Lee Jones, who is intrinsically awesome, and the charming Robert Downey Jr. Their acting in this movie, however--and the rest of the cast's acting--is cringe-worthy. I had been hoping for a fun, bombastic action movie--something so ridiculous it's funny, like ""Con Air"". This wasn't quite over-the-top enough to be very funny, although the plot was preposterous. I had to hit ""stop"" after about an hour; I just could not stand it anymore."
5,A Show Stopper,"I'll tell you right from the start, GET THIS MOVIE. This is one for the records if you like movies that are full of action and that grips you.Right from the start, you have to pay attention to the details and that's what makes the movie take off for you. Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes are the best duo even though the play opposite roles in this intence movie. I tell you, it had me on the edge of my seat. A Movie you could watch over and over again. I HOPE THEY MAKE A SECOND ONE (Part II)?"
1,Boring sequel to The Fugitive,I loved the Fugitive. I hated this movie. The formulaic script takes each hook and trick from the Fugitive and puts it into this new movie context. Save your money - or just watch The Fugitive again. END
1,If you saw the Fugitive... don't get this tape !!!,"Besides the fact they replaced a few things by others in this movie, the scenario is strictly and 100% the same !!!! You feel robed at the end, and it gives you impression of ""deja vu"". I wish I could rank it 0 star ! Even dialogs are sometimes the same !!! Yeeek"
1,This Special Editon is terrible.,"If you release a DVD, you got to include the original movie. Look the details before you even consider buying this SE DVD. Be aware!"
1,Too much talk over,US Marshals is a great movie in my opinion. This edition has the director talking nonstop throughout the whole movie. I couldn't hear the actors because of the director's comments. This fact ruined the movie for me.
1,Why?,"I hated the movie, because they gave Wesley Snipes a white girl friend in the movie!I could live without that BS in live and in the movies!"
2,This film can be summed up in one qusetion: Why?,"U.S. Marshals, a semi-sequel to 1993's The Fugitive, raises one question: Why? Why did the studio bother to put out a mediocre film that is a semi-sequel to the first, much better film? To make money, obviously. Studios do it all the time, but this film isn't a full fledged sequel, like I said before, it's a semi-sequel. In a way it almost redoes the first film but not in a good way. Jones, as always, is good here but is not given much to work with here and Snipes turns in a rather bland performance. All in all, stick with the original."
5,This is a good movie with good acting,This is a very good movie and has good acting. A good sequel to the Fugitive. END
4,Well-done fugitive spin-off (Spoiler),"I admit it, there are far too many similarities between ""Fugitive"" and ""U. S. Marshals"". In a nutshell, the fugitive Deputy U. S. Marshal Gerard and his team are chasing in both films is innocent and is returning to his old stomping grounds to prove it. Still, the action and the characterization in both is good and keeps you watching even when you know the conclusion. Well done and I honestly wish they would do more ""Sam Gerard"" stories."
2,Couldn't Get Into It,"The only reason to watch is because of Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes, & Robert Downey, Jr....and maybe the spectacular airplane crash.The plot was convoluted and far more complicated than necessary. It goes on and on and on...way too long.I liked ""The Fugitive"" and I enjoy good action/thriller movies, but I just couldn't get into this one."
4,"STARTS WITH A BANG, REST IS DECENT POPCORN YARN","If you're looking for more than cheap thrills and bravado, you may be disappointed as US Marshal drags for about half an hour or so more than it needs to. But it rises above its hackneyed chase routines with Jones' commanding screen presence. Some scenes, such as the opening plane crash, are exemplary cinematography. The soundtrack effectively complements the roller-coaster action sequences. There's a surprise twist in the tale too, but don't read too much lest you should spoil it. Recommended rental, for sure."
2,US Marhsals,"I loved this movie, if only for Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Wood (don't know who that is? Don't worry, I'm the only one) and because it was a sequal to my most favourite of movies.But if you're not considering this movie because of your fantatical devotion to a single actor or series, then take your time deciding. The director was a first-timer, the plot is almost completely identical to the Fugitive (except...Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes aren't as cool together as Tommy and Harrison) and there are a fair number of awkwardly done 'funny bits'. I would rate it as an average cop drama, and a fairly underwhelming sequel.However, I loved it, but I suspect that my motives are a little different than most peoples'."
4,Action Packed,"How this movie came to be is anybody's guess. Who would have thought that you could make a sequel, cut the main character from the original movie, and still succeed. While there weren't any really big surprises throughout this movie it still is action packed and ready to please. I would highly recommend this movie. A little better defined plot would have helped improve this movies standing. I also would have appreciated a little bit better character development for the rest of the supporting cast. Overall though it was a good movie and I would watch it again."
1,Good and Bad,"I did like how many cards it held, but it was a pain to get the business cards out. In the end i threw it away and bought a business card holder case."
2,Limited value.,"Nice pictures, if you're into Rembrandt, which I'm not so much. Banal poetry. Little else. blah blah blah blah blah"
2,Background Music,"One sure fire way to tell if an album is great is to think about how it would sound if certain portions were missing, like a guitar solo or a verse. The first time I listened to ""Inindependence"", I loved it, but I noticed that I kept getting distracted. So when I finally gave it a closer listen, I realized that they could eliminate an entire SONG and it would make no difference. However, they are all competent musicians, and if you work in a record store this is a great album to play. But apart from that, there is nothing remarkable here, and it's just not worth owning."
5,Carbosticks,"I've been using Carbosticks for years now and I've only broken 2 pairs out of the dozens I've bought! I play extreme metal so I probably hit a lot harder than some which makes it more impressive that they don't break. They are comfortable, responsive and I like the idea of black drum sticks! Definitely my favorite stick! You won't be dissapointed!"
2,Too Scary for Words,"Though this book is very nicly written, the illustrations are freaky!!!!!The monkey made my whole family scream in terror! I would not recommend this book for children under 7 years of age ."
5,"Hey, its Steig!","There isn't much more to say than it is written by William Steig. The intelligent language, wry humor, and refusal to talk down to his youthful readers has always marked Steig's books; this one is no exception."
4,Not as Good as the Original,"As a big fan of Steig, and of the original Dr. De Soto book, I was excited to find that there was a sequel. However, it was a bit of a letdown.The story isn't bad, especially on the first read. De Soto and his wife are called away to Africa to treat an ailing elephant, but before the doctor can complete his work he is kidnapped by a moronic monkey named Honkitonk. The interaction between these two is mildly amusing. You feel for De Soto's plight, but he eventually escapes to return to his beloved Deborah, and all ends well.After a few reads the story just doesn't hold up well. I find myself wishing my daughter would bring me the original instead, but the novelty of the new one hasn't worn off yet.I wouldn't discourage the purchase of this book for fellow De Soto fans, but if one were looking to purchase a Steig book, there are a number I'd recommend before this one."
3,unsure result yet,"It's been 3 months of using this product. It seemed working after 1 & 1/2 months of taking it. But, I don't know now"
3,hair,"The product works but unfortunately the pills are gigantics so i could not swallow them, otherwise a pretty good product"
4,Good when it is full,"Basically, this is like a normal air horn except when it runs out you can refill it with normal air. To refill it, the package comes with a hand pump. That is absolutely worthless. You can not get more than a gasp out of the horn with using the hand pump. Instead, when I used a tire pump the horn was full power and worked well, so it's a fine horn when you fill it up the right way."
2,Low charge,"Would not recommend. Doesn't hold a charge. Pump that comes with it is terrible. It is loud, but not very easy to use when needed. I you would be better of to buy the Air Horn that uses the compressed air cans."
1,Useless,"This product is useless. The company will not do anything about it, or return my calls. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,"not accurately described, does not contain adjustable follower","The product description claims: ""The Globe-Weis Fiberboard Document Storage Case also features an adjustable follower inside to keep your contents upright, and a stylish green faux leather design on the cover for a professional look""The was no adjustable follower inside, that hence nothing to keep the contents upright. Hope I can get my money back."
5,"Simple, Straightforward End Times Theology","Although the author doesn't directly say it, Waldron presents in this book a simple, straightforward case for amillennialism. He does a good, thorough job of addressing the flaws of the extremely popular dispensational premillennialism (""Left Behind"" theology). He avoids excessive use of technical jargon, and is easy to follow.Waldron here, contrary to what many people may think of amillennialists, is very emphatic about the Bible being God's inerrant, inspired Word. He uses a simple approach to interpreting the Scriptures' stand on the end times -- start with the clear, literal passages as a basis, then build upon them with the less clear, figurative passages. He provides a several diagrams to make his views even easier to grasp.This title is an excellent alternative to the ""Left Behind"" theology so prominent today. I recommend it highly."
4,Don't Let this Little Mouse Fool You!,"It may be a small mouse, but it does everything a regular size mouse does. If you're limited with space or need a smaller mouse for your laptop and don't want a regular size mouse, this is perfect. It fits right into my laptop case and it doesn't take up any space. And with its retractable cord, it's even more portable.Excellent product! I recommend it to anyone."
4,A bit small,"The mouse works well and has all the funtions of a full size optical mouse. After a period of long use, my hand tends to cramp because it is small. A small price to pay for the convenience."
4,Targus PAUM01U Ultra Mini Retractable Optical Mouse,"The mouse is small and easy to install. A small problem would be that the pointer moves by itself when I am not using it. Overall, it's a nice mouse."
1,Life expectancy - 6 months,"I am on the same boat with people who rated low. This mouse died after about 6 months. If you are rich, keep buying this one and keep replacing. I am not, so I will buy another product as a replacement."
5,HOW-TO Revive the left-click when it eventually quits!,"I have 4 copies of this little mini-mouse now, The latest came this week and is different ""ultra-portable""; slightly larger, more substantial looking. Time will tell about this one.My discussion is about the 3 original slim ""mini"" mice I have bought over the past three years. They all worked great, traveled easily, but in about a year, the left-click button quit working properly - more of a hit-or-miss. I finally found the problem, I think. Guessing that the left-click button was infrequently transferring my push to the switch inside, I took each mouse apart (two screws) and added a drop of J-B WELD cement to the tip of the left-click post inside the cover - it doesn't take much, applied with a toothpick, to add sufficient length to the post so that, after overnight to set, the built-up post will click that switch again. They all work now!Get J-B WELD at Home Depot - It fixes most everything!"
4,Very small mouse,The mouse is very small which I was seeking. I have had no issues with it to date. My purpose was to find the right size mouse for a Netbook.
1,doesn't work very well,"I wanted to like this mouse, and have used a similar one from Kensington with great success for years, but for some reason it just doesn't work very well and is a great disappointment. Now I have to go out and buy another brand of the same thing just to get work done! It's way way too jumpy, on any number of surfaces I tried. It keeps releasing the item I've selected too soon so the amount of clicking and dragging I have to do just to get one thing done has been increased tenfold. It jumps the cursor all over the screen when my hand is just sitting still not moving. Very frustrating to use. Can't wait to get rid of it."
5,Very Practical!,"I love this little mouse! It is just perfect for travelling with your laptop anywhwere! It comes with a soft bag, and with the retractable cable is very comfortable to use!"
5,a small miracle,"This tiny mouse is the coolest thing I've bought for my laptop. I have a Mac and it works great - not only for surfing but also doing graphic design... Its retractable cord is perfect to save on space and keep everything together. There is no battery needed and it is so lightweight. Plus the rollerball and 2 clickers add to the ease of using the mouse. Its almost too lightweight to feel like its real (kinda resembles the weight of a keychain or something.) Its a great device. So far, anyway."
3,so-so,"Targus PAUM004U Notebook Optical Mouse (with Blue Light)pros:1) overall design;2) comparatively little physical weight;cons:1) ""blue light"" feature is (IMHO) pretty irritating and there is no way to switch it off;2) often senses double-click, when you click only once;3) stopped working after 1 year"
2,Mouse Size is Great; Retracting Cord Broke Quickly,"Bought the mouse for a Dell Inspiron 600 because of size and retractable cord. The size fits in a laptop case easily and is far less bulky than others. While very small, it works well on small tables, on the computer itself and on an airplace tray. But, the lock on the cord rewind device broke within one month and I now have to tie a knot in the cord on both sides of the rewind section to keep it from snapping back against the computer when no in use. It didn't really cost that much, but, as it turned out, it was a waste of money. I no longer use it. When it worked, I would rate it a 5; broken a 0."
2,Lovely until it breaks,"My husband's gone through two of these. When the mouse button on the first broke, he chalked it up to bad luck. When the second broke, he bought another brand. Fine mouse, great ergonomics, but it only lasted a couple of months."
1,Junk,"Don't waste your money. This dual-mode mouse / trackball is a piece of junk. Following the instructions, the device does not properly switch to trackball mode."
4,Does the job!,"The Targus ultra mini mouse would likely not be the ideal optical mouse for constant use. It's size makes it a bit uncomfortable to hold, but for shorter term use and for convenience to transport, it does the job well."
4,It is Mini,"Because it is so mini, so small, it is hard to use after just a few minutes. Fingers get all cramped! Otherwise it is a good little mouse."
2,Works fine for six weeks!,"I spent an exorbitant $20 on this mouse one night when I was mouseless and desperate. Then my old mouse's trackball showed up and this guy sat in the box for two months. When I finally opened it, I was thrilled to discover that it was really fantastic and easy to use. The tiny size is no hardship and it was efficient and otherwise awesome. For six weeks. I woke up today to discover it no longer allows you to open pages with a scroll wheel click. As I spend all day opening tabs (I am a blogger, so I need to look at lots of pages at once to put together posts) this mouse is now useless to me. Alas, no mouse I have has held up like my Logitech Trackball, but the ball keeps going on a wander and the cat likes to hide it, so my hunt for a mouse that *actually works* begins anew. >sigh<"
5,Quality Small Mouse,"This targus mini mouse is great! I actually use it for my full-size work station since I have smaller size hands. It has a quality feel when you R-click / L-click, which most other mice feel cheap and emit an annoying click. The operation is smooth and fast, which I like since I do a lot of 3D modeling. So far, it has lasted a lot longer than most of the other laptop-sized mice have. Overall I would highly recommend thsi product."
1,Excellent before it died - short life span,"This mouse was everything I wanted: Small, retractable, easy to take with me. It was a five star mouse for it's three week life span - but it died at a much to early age for the money I spent on it.It does sometimes come back to life - only briefly until the 'USB device unrecognized' message re-appears a few minutes later. Tested it in every USB port on two computers and the same thing - 99% completely dead and 1% back to life for a few minutes like it's gasping for its last breath. Very disappointed."
2,"I Like The Mouse, But It Dies Too Soon","As said by other people, if the product works it is great. Then suddenly within a year, it dies. And to think I used my Staples Rewards to purchase the product."
2,Loved it while it lasted,"It is the perfect size to operate on a laptop on your lap. I liked it so well after a week that I bought a second one. However, after two months, the first mouse worked very poorly (scrolling a click-selecting were very delayed and intermittent) without completely dying."
3,3.5 stars -- a nice deal,"i like the small size of this mouse. now and then the cursor jumps on its own to somewhere -- and it takes a moment to find it. also, the scroll button does not work with all programs -- but it does work with Word and other standards. it was not too bad to set up -- and it's a bonus that it's usb."
4,Good for small hands,"The mouse works justs fine, but I have long fingers, so it's not very comfortable for me."
3,Very handy but somewhat fragile,"I've had my Targus minimouse for somewhat less than 1 year. Generally, it works fine. Recently, it has begun to act up: the pointer wanders leftwards across the screen at times, and; double clicking now requires triple and quadruple clicking.The mouse is VERY small and a bit awkward to use. By contrast, the Microsoft M20 is somewhat larger and seems more rugged.I am going to replace the mini Targus with the Microsoft mouse soon."
3,Mini Mouse,"Considering how heavy cordless mouse(s) are with batteries etc, this is a featherweight and worth the nuisance of a cord. It is the third one I have owned, the springs inside are not long lasting, but for the money, it is a good performer."
3,"Works, but has some minor issues","1. The cord is not very long2. The cord holder is heavier than the mouse and will pull it down if you aren't working at a flat table/desk.3. The buttons don't seem to work 100% of the time. Probably more like 99%.These aren't big issues. If you need a very small mouse, this is good. If you don't have this requirement, there are better mice out there."
1,Don't buy this mouse!,"I bought this mouse because i wanted something small to use with my laptop. I have to admit the size is great its about 3 inches long, good for me, might be bad for someone with big hands. It comes with a little case. The mouse worked great for about 2 days and then just stopped working! I dont know what happened, it just never worked again! I ended up just goign to Walmart and buying one from microsoft for $15. Ive had it now for a few months and its doing great. DONT BUY THIS MOUSE UNLESS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PAPERWEIGHT!!!!"
2,Often short lived!,"I'm on my third Targus PAUM01 Ultra Mini Mouse. The problem is in the miniature electrical switches beneath the ""click"" buttons, they wear out far too quickly. I wish that Targus would try using a different brand of switch to see if the usable life of this mouse could be extended. The rest of the design is very nice for an ultra-small mouse (that's my reason for 2 stars), but that's of little consequence if the switches stop working prematurely."
4,"It's very handy, not built that well though","It looks awesome, feels awesome and the click buttons are quite good. But I was dissapointed with the scroll button, it didn't work well, it kept getting stuck, sopmetimes the button was rolling but the screen wasn't scrolling. Otherwise it's a good buy, and totally worth the price"
3,functional but to sensitive,Only had mouse for 2 weeks but I find that the scroll button is very sensitive and causes the monitor screen to wiggle up and down very rapidly if you unintentionally touch it. Which is fairly easy to do because the mouse is micro small. I am shopping for a replacement.
3,"Pleasure to use, but doesn't last long","The Targus mouse is pleasure to use when new. It is lightweight, the retractable cord is convenient; I carry it everywhere.However, it does not last very long under daily use! I am about to throw out my second one after a little less than a year. (The first lasted less than a year too).The main problem is that the connection between the cord and the mouse becomes weak, and the mouse disconnects from the computer, probably because of the repetitive strain of extending and retracting the cord. The other problem is that the springs under the mouse buttons weaken quickly and I find myself double clicking unintentionally or not clicking at all.If you intend to use this daily, you may want something sturdier, otherwise this is a fine choice."
3,"good for 5 months, then it dies","i loved this mouse when i first got it. it was small, portable, and didn't take too much space. the retractable cord was the next best thing to cordless. but, after about 5 months of use, the right click stopped working. a friend of mine tried to fix it, said that it was dirty, and it worked for about 2 wks after that. asked the same friend to look at it again, he said the thing that connected the clicker to the sensor was too short after taking the thing apart. so, he tried rigging it, but now its just broken. if they made a better version of this, i'd try it again."
3,Ultra mini lives up to it's name for good and bad reasons,This has got to be the smallest mouse ever invented. It's size may be it's greatest asset but it's also it's biggest adversity. At times I'm not sure which button I'm clicking and it feels like it's hard to control. It's lightweight and easy to pack but just somewhat awkward to manuever because it's so small. It's great to use when you're out and about but not as much for everyday use.
2,"Nice Idea, Lousy Scroll Wheel","I thought this would be the perfect accessory for my laptop, which I carry with me every day. I am a web user who relies on the scroll wheel to navigate pages, and no sooner did I throw out the receipt and packaging (thereby eliminating chance of returning it), the scroll wheel started failing frequently. Now it only catches a fraction of the time. I'm disappointed."
1,targus mini mouse,this mouse is a waste of money. i have two now and both are very ineffecient. the right button doesn't work properly and basically the systems have tough time with this mouse
1,"five months, minimal use, dead as a doornail","Nice enough while it worked. It lights up when I plug it in, but I get the message that a USB device has malfunctioned over and over-doesn't work anymore. Then I go back to my larger, but tough as nails logitech wireless mouse that I've had for YEARS, and I'm back in business. Won't buy from this manufacturer at all again.And actually, I didn't like the size of the mouse, a bit awkward-small."
1,Disappointed!,"I went through 2 different mice before I realized this item just isn't worth it! I initially thought that I was the problem of the first mouse only working for 4 months. But when I purchased the 2nd one, it only lasted 6.5 months."
2,Mouse not so bad - scroll wheel not recognized,"It's a mini mouse - if you don't want that, don't buy this! Mine has held up OK, the size works for me, I like the retractable cord. (Note - I'll do anything to avoid using a touchpad or keyboard micro-joystick). But my laptop doesn't recognize the scroll wheel (which I've been using more and more with regular mice) and there is no driver available to try and reinstall. And occasionally it seems ""goofy/jumpy"" but many days it isn't, I've never seen a pattern although another person said that Excel upsets his mini-mouse."
3,Fades in and out,I purchased this for my laptop. It is recognized and works for a short while then stops. I have to unplug it and plug it in again. Not impressed.
1,Regret it,"I normally have a pleasant shopping experience at amazon.com. But this mouse is the worst thing I have bought here or elsewhere in a long time.It's unfair to say it doesn't work. But from the first day, it someimes works and sometimes doesn't. And you are never gonna know when it is going to stop working when you sit down in front of your computer. When it doens't work, I have to unplug it and re-plug it into a certain position (not fully plugged in, that way it is certain that it won't work). And I have to do this a couple of times per day. There is nothing wrong with my computer's USB port, I tried plugging in my printer and internet cable in the same port (into a fully plugged-in position) they all work all the time. Now I am getting tired of this and will throw the thing away even though...sometimes it works."
1,waste of money,"I bought this yesterday(Black Friday) from OfficeMax.The first one didn't work at all(no light after I plug in the USB port of my laptop), today I went back to officemax and replaced it with another one, that 's the one I am ""using"". The left botton and right button and the scroll wheel are working, but the pointer dosn't mover at all. I used 2 in a row within24 hours and neither is working properly, I don't think this is my computer problem, I tried it on all my 3 computers, one P4 desktop, one P4 laptop and one intel centrino laptop, any other USB devices work very well on these computers.I suggest you don't buy it, it is cheap, buy you'll waste your money, I am going to return mine, it disspointed me very much."
4,Apple Loves It Too!,"So when I received this item in the mail, the packaging said it required Windows (there was nothing on there that said Mac. So I got nervous. And wanted to assure everyone it works just as well on an Apple, (at least on my PowerBook anyway...) It's a great, small mouse with a really nice black pouch to put it in. It works well for on the go. For long periods of time when you're doing intensive mouse-only activities, the extremely small size can start to hurt your hand, so for those times you'd want a larger mouse for more comfort. But this looks so cool, is designed so well, and even comes with a little pouch so I must say I love my new mini-mouse. :-)"
1,"Don't bother with this mouse, it will break in less than a year.","I've had two of these, and while they were working, they were great, but unfortunately, after about six months or so, they stopped working for no apparent reason.Targus replaced the first one, but then the second one stopped working as well. I give up. Learn from my mistakes!"
1,Poor performance right out of the package,"The main problem is the scroll wheel. Its operation is very 'iffy'. It will scroll sometimes, for a bit, then stop and sometimes even bounce the page (i.e. when scrolling down it will suddenly reverse direction for a second like a ball hitting the floor). Most frustrating, trying to get it to scroll for me. Other times it will not scroll at all, or stop scrolling for no apparent reason. It is driving me crazy! Also, the mouse click button is not smooth at all. Not natural feeling. Difficult. I bought this to replace a previous Targus, which worked fine. But this one really blows Worse mouse I've ever used."
2,Buggy,"I've had this mouse for a while, and I have two major problems with it.1) It doesn't work properly on most surfaces. Any surface that has any sort of red tint or any kind of dark surface it seems to dislike. The pointer will jump around randomly because of this.2) The mouse will occasionally click twice when you only click once. This causes you to accidentally close windows you didn't want to and open files that you dont want to. It is very frustrating.Other than that, I like the design. Any smaller would be too small I think. The bright blue LED is a bit obnoxious though. If I were you I'd drop down a few extra bucks and get something decent."
2,great mouse... but only when it's still working,"I bought my Targus mini retractable mouse a few months ago.The first few months it was working really great. I would have given it 5 stars. It was very nifty and handy, plus it went nicely with my small laptop. It doesn't clutter your bag or desktop. I got really nice comments about this cute mouse.After a few months the mouse just stopped functioning properly. I had to click several times for it to really 'click', the pointer is very erratic at times, the scroll does not work anymore and I can't seem to retract the cord. In short, it's busted.It's not worth worth it. Nice mouse, but it has a really short lifespan. I would have bought a more expensive mouse rather than this one."
4,Good but fragile cord,"I have used it fine for a couple of years. Handy because it's small and easy to take with me. Sadly, this week it became erratic...I think the thin wires that connect it to the USB port via the ""retractable"" spindle seem to have developed an internal invisible break. Otherwise it was great."
3,OK mini-mouse,I bought this mouse to use with my laptop - I wanted a small mouse that I could throw in my laptop bag. And I prefer using a smaller mouse - so I sometimes use this as my primary mouse. Very functional. One minor negative: I had bought this mouse before a while ago and it was slightly smaller. It's still small - but not quite as small as before. But it's worth a try if you're looking for a travel mouse (or simply prefer smaller mice!)
4,Works fine. I'm satisfied.,"While not the fanciest mouse, the Targus Notebook Optical Mouse with Retractable Cable works just fine. It could be a bit more comfortable in my hand, but overall, I'm satisfied.I've been using it less than 3 weeks, so I don't know how well the retractable aspect will continue to work."
5,Wonderful Book,"I have many Brazilian Portuguese books. This is by far the best. My Brazilian wife can also use it to translate to English. If you are at all a person who reads to learn, get this book. I bought mine in the airport in Brazil and was looking on Amazon for a copy, but seems delivery is very long and price way higher."
2,Ripoff of Casablanca; not up to Stirling's usual quality,"This novel blatantly rips off the movie Casablanca plot point by plot point.If you've seen the movie and don't mind reading it again with furry aliens as the characters, by all means buy this book.If like me, you object to spending money for a uncredited, stolen story that you've already seen, try some of Stirling's other works and avoid this one."
4,"Wow, a return to Classic Erskine","Having found this book in Scotland last fall, I excitedly purchased it and set aside, only recently getting a chance to read it. This is classic Erskine and a welcome return after her last two books which seemed to be written for the American market rather than from the heart. All the classic Erskine elements are here: a Celtic theme, wonderful paranormal elements and a mystery to be solved. Ms Erskine will not disappoint with this latest offering. This one is sure to join the ranks of KINGDOM OF SHADOWS and LADY OF HAY in providing the reader with a full-bodied read of such depth and mystery that even the most cynical historical reader won't be able to put it down. Glad to see a return to what she does best; classic paranormal fiction"
5,Excellent,"Another good book by Barbara Erskine. I found it quite different from her other books. Some pages of the book gave me goosebumps. Pepole will love, and then hate Brid. Some will actually feel sorry for her. I didn't.A must read for every Erskine fan! Can't wait for the next book."
2,not her best,"It begins well and is intriguing, but then loses its depth. I did not care about any of the characters because there was no depth to them either. Adam is completely unlikeable and Erskine never really goes into detail the relationship of all the characters enough in order for me to care about them. The ending of this book was also lousy."
2,I wish I had read the above review...,"I wholeheartedly agree with the above review, and I wish I had seen it before I spent good money on this book. The story concept is intriguing (time travel, neolithic and modern day romance which goes wrong) but the writing is terrible. The story jumps around, things happen too fast and character development is poor. But I managed to get through it."
2,Not her best one,"Almost done reading this book. THis book is definately not like her other ones. IT just drags on and on , back and forth and back and forth...dont waste your money on this one."
1,Quite Dreadful,"This game was quite dreadful, as RPGs go. First of all they couldn't even put enough effort into it to make the graphics even half that of the original Diablo. The game-play is decent enough and simple, which I believe to be a plus, but the story-line far too generic and has no real substance. I suggest you go play the original Diablo or Diablo II before you waste time on this game. You may possibly wish to go ahead and play the demo first, just google search for it, to see how horrible it is for yourself."
4,I love this kayak,"The Advanced Elements Inflatable Kayak has exceeded my expectations. I knew it would be convienient and portable, which is the main reason I purchased it. I had resigned myself to the fact that I would give up some of the performance and comfort of a hard kayak, well was I suprised. The Kayak handles very well, has great glide, and is very comfortable. I can paddle for hours in this kayak. I have also purchased one for my wife and she loves hers too. I would highly recommend this product. The only thing I can say negative is that on a hot day it takes a little of your paddleing energy to inflate, but I have overcome this by a battery powered inflator. You will still need to top it off by hand though."
4,"NICE, BUT......",I like the nippers except they are a little too thick and so are hard to handle. I had difficulty getting them close enough to my cuticles.
2,Soft metal,"I chose these because I wanted cuticle nippers with scissor-like handles and was looking for something higher quality than your average cuticle nippers. I was willing to pay more for something that I hoped would be of high quality. At Target, one can purchase a whole manicure set for less than the price of these.These are not as good of a quality as the ones I was replacing - I had inherited my previous nippers from my grandmother and they were probably manufactured decades ago. In particular, the metal seems way too soft. When I was initially opening the package, the nippers fell out of the package and onto my tile floor and one of the tips got smashed in. The result is that they only work well on one side (when the good tip is closest to what I am trying to cut). The product says it has a lifetime warranty through the manufacturer, simply by mailing them the product. I am hoping they will send me new ones."
4,A very useful book for the amateur astrologer,"I use this book quite a lot when I'm writing up a chart; it provides clearly written, detailed delineations of each planet/sign combination, describing what each placement could mean for a personality. There's a good sense of each planet's distinct role; plentiful examples of people who epitomize, e.g., Mercury in Aquarius are also helpful. My one quibble is that it's sometimes a bit inflexible, as if some personality traits are always associated with a given placement. A ""Planets in Houses"" sequel would be appreciated."
5,Simple and easy,"Good starter book, good flow and easy to understand. A great beginner book to refrence from time to time"
1,Sophomoric and Saccharine,"A positive view of the Orthodox community? Come on! These women -- even Batsheva, the ""heroine,"" the iconoclastic outsider, convert who dares to dress and think a little differently and who maybe even sinned once or twice in her almost forgotten past -- are narrow, petty, nosy, gossiping, lamebrained. As characters in a novel they are predictable and banal. If I lived in a ""community"" like the one depicted I would run away, too. The writing is childlike and plodding and overly saccharine; hardly a biting satire. And the plot? A teenager leaves the community and so does the rabbi's son, and finally some people realize it's not the fault of the iconoclastic outsider. Spare me. Find another creative writing program. I wonder sometimes: with all the good writing going on, how does something like this get published?"
1,A book that aspires to be lackluster.,"This book has all the depth of a petri dish. There are no fresh insights into the human condition. The characters are flat, uninteresting and unsympathetic. The dialogue is trite. I was so frustrated with the book that I was hoping that the ladies of Memphis would succeed in driving Batsheva from their midst. I found her character to be insipid and uninspired. Don't be mislead by all the other positive reviews. This is not quality fiction."
2,Interesting depiction of place but plodding storyline,"I am afraid I have to agree with those who thought this novel was lackluster. While I enjoyed the foray into the Orthodox Jewish community of Memphis, which I did not even know existed, I found the story line to be plodding and not very innovative. The characterization was sterotypical and I found Batsheva to be too ""perfect"" in many ways. There was also too much foreshadowing with little to anticipate. The moral of the story was nothing new and the inability of the Jewish women to see the reality around them was a bit unbelievable. Really couldn't wait for the novel to end after the first half of the book. I enjoyed the descriptions of Jewish holidays and rituals, however. It was informative and interesting and added to the story immeasurably. Without the southern-influenced Jewish food, I don't think I could have made it to the end!"
4,*Great read for commuters*,"If you're looking for an entertaining read for your daily commute-this is a good choice. It's a simple story about the struggle of being the newcomer in a closeknit community-not a new theme, but still an interesting one that most people can identify with. If you're at all curious about Orthodox Jewish traditions and culture, this book gives a good snapshot of daily life and issues. A nice quick read. I'll pass this on to my mom and sister."
5,Topics that touch us all!,"Although I have grown up as a Conservative turned Reform Jew in the metro-NY region, I can recognize many of characters in this book as Sisterhood and Temple Board members I have known. Ms. Mirvis insightfully portrays the well-meaning yet somehat alienating cliques who believe they know what's best for their community. I also found this book quite educational, teaching me the inner workings of an Orthodox Jewish community. I especially enjoyed reading the Q& A at the end of the book between Ms. Mirvis and the real Ladies Auxiliary, providing further insight into the novel and the author.I am anxiously awaiting her next book!"
1,Boring,"I am so glad that I'm not the only person who thought this book wasn't very good. I can't figure out what the reviewers in the front of the book are raving about. Reading this book was like trudging through mud up to my knees. In fact, I put it down when I was about one-quarter through, and read 3 other books before I picked it up again. I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. I found the use of the first-person plural pronoun for the narrative voice very annoying. Although, I don't think any voice could overcome the slow-moving and boring story."
3,Catch a glimpse of a different lifestyle,"The book earned three stars because it taught me something. I got a glimpse of Orthodox Jewish traditions and beliefs, a religon I know little about. But the story wasn't engaging. I didn't find the heroine very interesting and the plot didn't provide much of a hook."
2,Better than root canal,"This book was selected by a local community group for a review session.Prior to attending the review, I thought it was one of the most poorly written books I had ever read. The characters seemed unreal, the plot contrived and the writing tedious at best. The book provoked an intense range of emotional responses from the women in the book club.They clearly saw aspects of themselves and their neighbors in the characters. The confrontation between tradition and modernity, as well as the duplicitous face of communal kindness, are strong thematic tensions in the book. Based on information shared at the book review,these tensions mirrored people's own experiences. Reluctantly, I admit the book is useful in touching on truths that would otherwise remain unexplored."
2,Doesn't quite work,"It's all a little too pat, Tova Mirvis' debut novel -- the free spirit, the gossipping yentas, a world turned upside down. The characters rarely emerge from two dimensions, and the Memphis setting could be any city with a small Jewish community -- or small ethnic community. The one attempt at experimentation, the first-person-plural viewpoint, should have been put aside. Mirvis has talent, but this novel should have been left in a drawer as a guidebook for the next project."
4,what an inventive read,"this is a most enjoyable book, the characters are well drawn and the author clearly knows these people and their community. what i enjoyed most was the obvious affection she has for them and their living traditions. i hope this gets published in israel. mazel tov."
5,"Here Fishy, Fishy, Fishy....","If you're like me & you PREFER to grill with a whole fish vs. the portioned off cuts then you will LOVE this gadget! Here's the trick - Open the basket. Line the inside with parsely, rosemary & bay leaves. If you want to get 'fancy' you can weave the rosemary & parsely branches/twigs into the grates of the basket. I don't but you certainly can! ;)Take your fish (like a yummy snapper), rub-a-dub the fishy with garlic, olive oil & parsley (the ""holy trinity"" of mediterranean cooking) and of course, salt & pepper. Slide your fishy into the herb-decorated basket & cook away!How fantastic to flip the fish without it ripping & falling apart!!! Happy Grilling!"
2,OK for large pieces,"I bought this product because it got a great review on America's Test Kitchen. I liked the idea that you could remove the handle and ""shut"" the grill cover - instead of having the handle stick out. Turns out an older basket I have for steak, which enables me to adjust its ""height"" to accommodate thin or thick pieces, is much better for handling fish - even though the handle sticks out."
1,ORDERED IN JUNE...RUSTING IN AUGUST!!!!,"Purchased this for a gift as it was highly rated by Cook's Illustrated. Works great...BUT....it is RUSTING! It's too late for me to return for refund according to Amazon, but want everyone to know that it is NOT a quality product."
4,Almost perfect,"I like how the handle is removable. But can be difficult to reattach at just the right angle to flip the basket on the other side.Still, I haven't found a better grilling basket."
2,Skip this basket,"The mesh is too far apart, which allows the fish meat to fall between, where it either sticks to the grill, or tears off and falls into the grill when flipping. Might as well put the fish directly on the grill. It isn't non-stick, but no basket is. It helps a lot to spray the baskets w/ Pam before grilling."
4,Fish Grill Basket,"Really keeps the fish from sticking during grilling. However, I find it difficult to open the basket to remove the fish."
2,Slips thru,"Unfortunately, anything less than a whole fish will slip thru the slots in this cage. It needs cross-bars to keep smaller pieces of fish in place but apparently that would have cost too much to add, I guess. Oh well."
1,How to market a poorly made product.,"I reviewed this once before, so I will do this one more time; but, I shall keep it short.When I recieved it the bend for the handle was improperly done. it would not connect to the device itself and it was so awkward to use, thatCharcoal Companion Ultimate Nonstick Fish-Grilling BasketI threw the damn thing in into the metal recycling ben. I will never purchase another Item mfd by ""Charcoal Companion"", ever again.SincerelyLarry C HorneP.S. Read your reviews next time."
2,Failed after a couple months,"Decent budget switch, but mine started failing after a couple months. Would have to reset on a daily basis."
2,Not Up To The All-Clad Quality,"The description states that this teakettle has a stay-cool handle which it definitely does not. The All-Clad cookware has the most amazingly cool handles so I expected the same. The maximum fill line for water is 1/3 down from the top, making the kettle a larger size than it needs to be for the recommended capacity. The balance point when pouring is not optimum and the handle flexes with the weight of the kettle and water. The whistle needs to be removed by hand when pouring then reinserted afterwards. The spring detent is stiff and makes this operation potentially risky. On the positive side, it does boil water rapidly, the whistle sounds good, and the spout doesn't drip."
1,Look somewhere else,"After many years of using Magnalite I bought new AllClad LTD cookware, including this teapot. As the other reviewers stated, the stay cool handle doesn't work. After a year of daily use the kettle leaked at the bottom of the spout and shortly after that the bottom sprang a leak.Don't waste your money on this one"
1,dissapointed,we have now had two of these kettles.both leeked badly from the base of the spout.the handle is not very protective.we give up.its too much bother to return this item again.looking elswhere.
1,Nice looking...,"Nice looking is about all I can say for this Kettle. I've had two. The first one leaked from the bottom. All Clad was good about replaceing it. The second one also leaked within about a year. The spout is difficult to use and I've been scolded a couple of times fooling with it.No reflection on the All-Clad Stainless cook ware I have, which is excellant.I don't know about the all stainless version, but this one is very poorly designed. Looks great though ... :-)"
2,Big All-Clad fan,"Love the stainless All-Clad line, and I have many pieces. I am not happy with the tea kettle. The ""stay cool"" handle gets very hot and if you want to use the whistle feature, you need to pull the piping hot whistle from the pour spout in order to pour out the water and put it back in after each use. Not worth the money."
4,"Nice, quality product.","PROS: Fit very well. Great color match. Seem to be constructed well. CONS: Obviously, price. Website did not specify with or WITHOUT manual, floor mounted 4x4 lever(so I have a gap). The 'mounting system' is rediculous. The 'trim caps' dont fit well and they CERTAINLY wont stay put if anyone ever actually USES the mats. All obvious issues simply inherent of such a design. Most any other mats would have the same issues."
4,GREAT MOVIE,"I purchased this DVD for my mother, who loved this movie. The only problem is that it states that there are ""extras"" including the courtroom drama. However, it was less than a 30 second excerpt and I found that disappointing..A bit of false advertising.However, it was still a great deal."
5,Just as good the second time around ....,"and third time ... . I saw this movie when it first aired on Lifetime, back when Lifetime had more than teenage related movies on. I loved it then and watched it anytime it reaired. Got the movie and watched it with the BFFs and we had a blast."
5,Another great movie from Lifetime channel,"I first saw this movie on the Lifetime channel and it was great. I have been looking for it for awhile. Now that I have it, I can watch it when ever I want to.My ex should watch this show, then he will see that I was not so bad during our divorce. This movie shows just how nasty things can get during and after a divorce. The fact this is based on true life is even more bizarre. It is unbelievable how mad a person can get.I would recommend this movie. It is very good and one you would like to see over and over again."
3,bad lady,"this lady was nut's. yes, her husband helped make her that way but she drove him to treat her the way he did. Everything was perfect at first but then she wanted everything from him. it takes two to ruin a marriage. I also blame the second wife. She knew he was married but she jumped right in there to help him cheat. What Betty did was totally wrong. All 3 of them were wrong.But the way she acted in prison proved just how crazy she was. And in the long run all she did was hurt her children."
5,You may be surprised at which side of the fence you find youself at the end of the movie.,"Just like the first jury that was deadlocked, reviewers ""Cathy"" and ""Flanks"" are on opposite sides. However it is inappropriate to say that ""Flanks"" is mentally unstable simplyl because his opinion differs from ""Cathy"". I believe Betty Broderick should only have been convicted of manslaughter. This does not mean I have ""psychological issues.""Around the country, people like ""Flanks"" and ""Cathy"" were discussing (and arguing) this case. In this film, you see the wonderful life Betty and Dan had - on the outside. On the inside, you see the fighting, Dan's infidelity, Betty's world caving in, the kids being stuck in the middle, and the tragic conclusion. Stephen Collins and Meredith Baxter do wonderful jobs as Dan and Betty. Watch and decide for yourself how you would've voted if you were on the jury. You may be surprised at which side of the fence you find yourself at the end of the movie."
4,Cheesey Divorce Story,This movie was pretty good. It seems to have been based on A Woman Scorned: The Betty Broderick Story--which is a television network edition. This is a condensed story mostly based on the lives of the Brodericks leading up to the divorce and murder. I wished it was the full-length story since an hour and a half wasn't long enough for me. Stephen Collins and Meredith Baxter did a wonderful job of playing Dan and Betty Broderick as well as numerous actors and actresses that have now gone on to bigger and better roles. Well worth the money. Especially if you are a true crime fanatic.
5,Meredith Baxter was Emmy material.,I love this movie & have seen it several times & never get tired of it. You really get to dislike Betty Broderick & you never know that Meredith is acting the part. She was just fabulous as Betty Broderick & should have won an Emmy for her role in this film. I cannot say enough about it.I highly recommend this movie.
1,Falls short on so many levels,"While one can appreciate the idea that Mr. Cantor puts forward in the sort of thesis of this book, his ideas of what causes this cynical outlook is sadly skewed by political ideology. While I was very much enthralled by the catchy title and wonderful cover art, I was disappointed that Mr. Cantor was just another standard bearer of the culture wars. I wouldn't recommend this book. TryAffluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic (Bk Currents)if you are looking for a better social critique on modern pop culture."
5,Mag carrier,The carrier is very well made and wears easily. It is easy to to put on and take off. I would recommend this carrier
5,there was an old lady who swallowed a trout!,"What a fun book!! My preschoolers love it. The illustrations are both colorful and beautiful and certainly depict the Pacific Northwest. It's such a great participation book, all the children love to join in and never tire of it."
4,Happy- Go -Lucky!,This book is a delight for children. I read it to a first grade class in the library. I noticed how interested they were in the lovely art work the book contains. I found it fun and perhaps a good book to read at the seashore!
3,Bar Faucet,"The faucet came in good condtion. But it was too tall for our bar. Had dificulty making arrangement to return it. First the phone call, no help just a ""return it to who you purchased it through."" Second, email. They sent a return number so it could be returned. Charged a 20% restock fee."
1,"Don't Buy this! It is censored, lame TV version.","This is not the uncut original version. Many scenes have been removed from this DVD version, unknowingly, as sad as that is. Laguna doesn't know what they are putting out. Sad... Find an old VHS version and you will get to see the film the way it was intended to be seen. Sexy and Funny. This version is just a waste."
1,Oh Come ON!!,"I've never read this book. At the prices being asked, I wouldn't buy it if Alice Cooper himself delivered to my house. What gives sellers?"
3,WHY IS THIS BOOK 700$$,"jsut wondering why a book would be over 30$, in this case why is the book over 500??? its only 254 pages long. why!"
2,Not as educational as I'd hoped,"I had ordered this book as a companion to the Insect Lore Ladybug Land, mainly because the Ladybug Land page had a ""buy together"" link. Since the Ladybug Land seems fairly educational, I figured the book would be too. I was wrong. The book is very, very simple. If you ""look inside"" the book, you see a page with some interesting facts on it. I was hoping the whole book would be more like that. Instead, it was one basic sentence per page. We actually learned more from the one-page paper/care instructions that came with our Ladybug Land than we did from this book. I will continue to look for a companion book for our next batch of ladybugs that we order for our Ladybug Land."
5,Lanyard,It's a present from Santa and can't image there will be anything wrong with it. Haven't opened it up yet.
2,3 months and dead,Had this blender for 3 months and the motor died on me. I was having problems that others were having with the blades getting stuck on ice cubes and not turning.
2,hate it,I bought this because of all the good reviews. I wish I hadn't bought it. I bought it to make smoothies and it doesn't blend very well. It leaves large chunks of fruit and ice all the time. I hate it. The spout does work good surprisingly. I will probably buy something else and put this in the back of my cabinet. Don't waste your $$.
3,Won't crush ice,I bought this blender along with many others to test out against my Villaware Smoothie Maker (which broke). This blender simply can't crush ice. I wanted all of the reviews of it to be true - but unfortunately I'm taking this blender back to Target. You get what you pay for I guess.
3,A fair study of a rare historical document,"McLean provides complete translations of all the plates of the Magical Calendar printed in 1620, which is an occult document that includes portions of the Jewish Kabbala and deals mainly with spellcasting and prophecy. Outside a small section of notes at the end, McLean fails to provide much narrative on various portions, and most parts must be further looked up in other works. The plates are in copier black and white, somewhat low qualoty. The binding is fair."
5,I Recommend The Mystery Scene Magazine,"If you like mysteries you will like this magazine. It gives you information about authors and at times you will find out snippets about unusual mysteries. This magazine also has short stories in it. I am a fledgling writer of mysteries so I appreciate Mystery Scene. I do believe, however, that a person who simply enjoys mystery stories will enjoy this magazine. I can't wait to get the next issue in the mail!"
3,not as good as...,"This book needs some clerification. I reccomend Harts ""Arafat"" and Aburishs 'Arafat' above this. This book tries to paint a picture of Arafat as a great legitimate political leader. But this book does not show the whoel picture. It makes Arafat out to be more then a terrorist and does nto weigh the effort that he was a viscious murdered of children(which he was for most of his life). THis book does take into account his many twists and turns but it probably gives Arafat too much credit and is not as interesting as other works on the man."
5,Inspiring and Uplifting!,"The book ""You Go Girl"" is a must have for female athletes of all ages. As you read through each chapter, the steps and obstacles of becoming a successful athlete are presented in the stories of women in the world of sports. The greatest part is you can pick up the book and begin reading any story! I am a teenager playing 3 sports in high school and can easily apply the lessons these women present into my daily routine. I have recommended this book to my friends and cannot wait to show my coaches!"
5,"Read this, then read......","Krakauer's ""Into the Wild"". By now you've read the reviews of the Year-Long Day, but then read Into the Wild- you'll flip. On one side you've got Ivar Ruud- painstakingly preparing for his Arctic months, then you've got Chris McCandless.....well, you'll see. The Year Long Day is one of my favorites- so much so that when we got our dog (a shepard, husky mix) we called her -what else- Naika. I think the Year-Long Day was made into a movie- anyone know what it's called? If so, please email me at cardinalwealth@yahoo.com. Thanks,"
4,A good guidebook.,"This looks like it will be very helpful for my daughter. She takes gymnastics classes, but with this book she can also work on skills at home, on her mat. (Her MAT, Ninjahawk, not the carpet! Carpeting is not designed for learning front-handsprings, unless you have high hopes of breaking your neck.)It shows and describes a nice variety of skills. My only complaint is that it covers skills for both girls and boys, so much of the content (rings/pommel horse/paralell bars) is useless. Perhaps they would have done better to have produced separate books for girls and boys gymnastics."
5,Great for Learning Basic Gymnastics Skills!!,"This was a terrific book! It explains all the gymnastics moves you have to know before you reach competitive Level 5. It was very useful, and helps improve your gymnastics skills. Each skill is divided into a category, (A for least difficult and C for most difficult) and has a diagram with instructions for the skills under it. There's a check list for when you have learned how to do the skill, too. I particulary liked the advanced section and the chapter about landing safely, which will be of great use to all gymnasts. This is the perfect book to guide you as you climb up the gymnastics ladder of skills!"
1,"Worthless...a catalogue, not a guide","I got this book because, in order to impress people, I had decided to teach myself gymnastics. Let me tell you, I taught myself front handspring from SCRATCH on my carpeting.Anyway...this book is worthless. All it does is list and rank various gymnastic tricks based on category and difficulty. You can't derive anything useful out of it. MAYBE if you're a coach, and you want to organize your gymnastics course, this could be a reference. But with just a simple diagram per stunt (just to show what it is), there is nothing here that will TEACH you how to do this. NOT FOR BEGINNERS.(DO NOT BUY)"
4,interesting observations,"This is a different type of travel book, less filled with first person stories or dialogues but full of anthropological, architectural, historical & social observations of Tokyo. The author lived in Japan for over 50 years and is obviously fond of Japanese culture. The book gives a sense of what the life is like in Tokyo (as much as one can gather from reading a book)."
2,A book for no one. Detestable.,"There seems to be more quotations in this book than original text, and half of them deal with London or Paris! There is no structure to the book: it is one continuous chapter very poorly written at that. The author makes an assertion in one paragraph only to contradict himself in the next.But the worst is not so much the style as the content. In this book, we ""learn"" that the Japanese are dirty (p.57), that they all look alike (p. 72), that they are like children (p. 88).I was extremely dissapointed. People who have lived fifty years in a place are usually able to convey something about it. This is not the case here. There seems to be no redeeming value about Tokyo. This is something with which I disagree, having myself lived there for more than ten years.This is not a book for people who would like to visit and not for people who have been there.This is a book for no one."
3,Ok but not 5 stars!,The item I got was not seemed around the breast line. I tried to resolve the problem by hand stitching but it was not a fix. Now I am stuck with two of these slim suits... but I finally learned that it is best to purchase this kind of item at a store when one can try before buying.
5,An extraordinary voice from aviation's past.,"His death last fall has silenced the voice of Dick Becker. Fortunately for aviation history enthusiasts, Joe Stamm has preserved his remarkable life story.A prewar enlistee in the U.S. Navy, Becker witnessed the first shot of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Subsequently he became one of the last Naval Aviation Pilots, enlisted men who were rated as Naval Aviators. Becker is probably best known for his participation in the postwar Thompson Trophy Races, flying a Super Corsair as Cook Cleland's partner.Stamm is a skillful interviewer who knew just what to ask to draw Becker out, and then gracefully stepped aside to allow him to tell his story.The interview offers a vivid look at a vanished era of U.S. aviation history."
4,Buyer Beware,"This is a great roasting rack, however, I bought it to go in my All-Clad small roasting pan and it doesn't fit. All-Clad makes a set that you can buy. Unfortunately, I purchased my pan many years ago."
5,Built tuff,"This nonstick roasting rack is awesome perfect for roasts, turkeys, and chickens, and more, I even had room for vegetables to go around the rack so I could roast them as the roast was cooking. I would recommend this product for those who enjoy cooking! Clean up is a breeze, I would call this rack the Cadillac of Racks!! :-)"
5,great,"Great deal, have been looking for one for a while but didn't want to pay a fortune for something I would only use a few times a year. Would buy from this seller again, it arrived as I expected it."
1,Made 'o steel,"""Constructed of thick aluminum..."" is an outright lie. How do I know? The magnet told me when it went THUD onto the middle of this rack.If I look past the fact that I spent $$ more for this one over other racks because I wanted rust free aluminum instead of steel, I could review it on its own merits. It is well constructed of heavy gauge metal with good welds. The coating has not failed after one use, so that is a good sign too. Best of all it fits nicely inside a 'Granite Ware 21.25 x 14 x 8.5 Inch Covered Rectangular Roaster' for a 22 lb turkey.IF they had it labeled as STEEL I would have given it 4 or 5 stars."
2,"well, it gets you started........","this interactive mentor does quite a lot to boost your knowledge of how routers work, and the basic configurations that you have to do to complete the labs, follow a strict rule...that you should read and reread the material that comes with the CD to help you through the labs. while the labs do not cover 100% all the configurations, it gives you ground to start from. i gave this 2 stars for the content, and left out the other 3 stars for failing to deliver what it tries to sell. you gain a good understanding from reading the material but the labs do not allow you to fully explore what you have learned through reading. and for the price i hope cisco review what they offer. other options for those determined to get some practice, think about the todd lammle CCNA with the RouterSim, as well as the SwitchSim, either from sybex, or from RouterSim.com. but still none of these can really beat the real thing."
2,CIM Vs. other Simulators,"CIM is like a course more than a simulator. RouterSim 2.0 or Sybex e-trainer are better simulators than all CIMs combined. Save your money and buy Routersim or Sybex.For the Reviewer that rated 5 stars, Michael Woznicki, he does the same for all kind of stuff and books. I think amazon should stop paid people to post 5 star reviews for books they have not probably even read. Check his reviews for the McGraw Hills Technical Library (BCRAN, BCMSN, etc.)"
1,"Junk, save your money!",I want a router simulator that actually lets me configure routers like I am sitting at the console port. This is not that product. I am extremely disappointed in Cisco and this product they are trying to sell as a router simulator. It does hardly anything at all. ...Don't waste your money on this rushed-to-market Cisco product. They are obviously just trying to sell on their name.
4,Good for CCIE Lab preparation,"This is the great stuff to prepare CCIE Lab test for Frame Relay, OSPF, EIGRP and BGP. But, you still need to find more practice for ISDN, ATM, DLSW etc. This material can cover above items perfectly."
4,A Good step in the right direction,"Cisco has done a pretty good job with this title. It will help you in understanding Routing protocols. This title only test your knowledge of Routing protocols. It does not teach you. The simulation engine is pretty good. Cisco should have more and more titles like this and also for teaching purposes. I rate it 4 stars, because I think OSPF and BGP should be covered in more detail. Happy Reading and Studying."
1,I returned this toy,"The dog was not the one in the picture,(Ty Whiffer-Large Sized Beagle) it was a smaller version, which also has different markings. and they said it was new, even thow it did have a tag on, the dog did look used. but needless to say, it was not the one that was advertised and they did take it back...I think when I purchase again, I would rather purchase from Amazon direct and not from the market place. It was very disappointing, not only for me, but for my grandson, who had misplaced his which he loved very much , and I was hoping to get a spare for him."
1,Facist Garbage,"After reading such books as ""A Place Called Waco"", and watching the excellent ""Waco: The Rules Of Engagement"", All I can say is that this is nothing but propoganda to demonize David Koresh and the Davidians, and portray the ATF as heroic dragon slayers. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this one and buy ""Waco: The Rules Of Engagement"", available on Amazon.com"
1,The Video Bible of FEDERAL CONSPIRACY THEORISTS,"Had the cast & crew of this laughable piece of Quackery lived in North Korea, they would be able to churn out this kind of stuff on a monthly basis.The reality is that were President Clinton to ship over several hundred CIA agents to Northern Ireland & have them adopt the same tactics towards Sinn Fein as they adopted towards the Branch Davidians, then there would be hundreds of dead Catholic women & children.Monthly.Back in the early 1970s, the American Psychiatric Assoc. determined that homosexuality was no longer to be classified as a mental illness.Now is the time for the APA to reverse the process.The belief that the FBI were ""innocent"" of murdering dozens & dozens of Branch Davidians must indicatePARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA.And warrent incarceration in a top security mental hospital.For life."
3,A good (and ACCURATE) made for TV movie,"Despite what some anti-government zealots may say, this was a very good and accurate account of the disaster in Waco. I do agree, though, about what the previous review said (nobody knew that National Guard helicoptors strafed the church. Nobody knew that because it's not true). People that do not know the facts but want to blame the government for something will say that this movie is factually inaccurate, but consider the source. It's bad enough watching Siskel and Ebert sometimes, but imagine a Michigan Militia Siskel and a Freeman Ebert."
3,Not dishwasher safe,"I was expecting this saucepan to be like my other stainless all-clad pieces that I can put in the dishwasher, but it is not. The dishwasher changes the color of the outside aluminum. I think that should be clear in the discription, but it is not. I was looking for the 3.5 size and it only comes in this stainless-aluminum combo material, not the all stainless. If you go to the All Clad website they report that their MC2 line must be hand washed, but it wasn't clear on this page. I would have returned it, but I don't suppose I can now that it has been through the dishwasher. It is still a nice sized sauce pan, just not as easy to care for as all stainless steel."
2,Be careful,"Big letters say ""Made in USA"" Small letters say made in China! A call to Customer Service was answered with ignorance and hostility. We own eight All Clad: two sizes of sauce pans and sauté pans, two ""copper core"" products, asparagus cooker and double boiler. The TRUTH is that sometimes only the handle is made in USA. Sometimes ONLY the rivets which attach the handle are stainless steel. All of this was discovered when we bought a INDUCTION cooktop. About half of our All Clad work with induction. Not all stainless steel is created equal. Buyer beware. VIKING, 7-ply Belgian-made, works with everything. Extraordinary quality."
4,unusual,This book differs from other novels in not following a clear formula. Would certainly read otherwork by the same author.
4,MILD Blue Cheese,Not being a big fan of blue cheese dressings - this one is great! The flavor is mild and there are no blue cheese chunks. This dressing is not overpowering as with other brands. If you are true blue cheese lover - steer clear.
1,Aeneid Review,"As a senior English teacher I have been looking for a video to use with my students. This dvd provides an adequate overview of the story; however, I question parts of its interpretation AND information. I have read other reviews that rate the contents of this dvd as more appropriate to a junior high audience. I do not disagree with that comment; however, I find if difficult to imagine the Aeneid being read and discussed with that age group. We are also having some difficulty with the audio on this dvd, and it's brand new! I would love to find a source for a really intelligent and interesting examination of Virgil's Aeneid."
3,Battery muncher!,"This is a good concept; the bug just spins in a circle until the one-button remote is pressed and it shoots forward in the direction it was last facing in its spin cycle. However, it eats batteries and is loud! Very annoying."
3,A blast from the past!,"You must be a baby boomer, who remembers the 1960's with a sense of humor rather than a sense of despair. This is a light-hearted look at teen-raising (or rather lack of it.) Although this movie was torn to shreds by critics, it brings back memories of the less serious side of the 60's, and the wonder of growing up. It serves to remind us that, while we are now older, we are indeed wiser."
3,Typical teenage romp,I only bought this movie as a way to remember Christina Ferrare when she was young; other than that it's just mediocre
3,Feminine Fantasy,"Oscar caliber screenplay? No. Mindless, happy ending escapism, yes! What every baby boomer teenage girl wanted: a ""shrink"" father who looked like David Niven and a ""suitor"" who looked like (a young) Chad Everett. I loved the repartee between the charachters the first time I saw this, 30 years ago, and I still do now."
2,Better than those unrealistic sitcoms of the 1960's!,"Even though the movie was'nt rated so good. I thought it was more realistic than watching those sitcoms of that time. It showed the real side of the parent getting mad and showing real feelings, unlike the Brady Bunch and others like it. David Niven was a great choice for the father with his sarcastic sense of humor, although I think they could have used a better actress than Lola Albright playing the mother. Donna Reed may have been a good pick with all her experience from her own show rearing baby boomer teenagers."
5,early american life,"This book presents early american real life on the farm with many wonderful detailed illustrations. Learn how a grist mill works, how roads were dug, how stone walls came to be, and other wonderful information about early america. The illustraions only add to the reader's understanding and amazement at how ingenious, hardworking, and skilled our early american ancestors were."
5,white out,"Any household will find many uses for this helpful and useful bleach pen. It has both a blotter and a pen size applicator on each end that makes any task very simple. I love to use it on white linen, napkins and towels. I also use it on my white Victorian lamp shades because it is so delicate on fine fabrics."
1,Ripped Off,"Was suppose to get 12 pens. They sent one. I paid $13.00 FOR ONE PEN!! I have wrote twice, no response.DO NOT BUY FROM THIS MANUFACTURER!!!!"
5,Great Product,This is a great product to get the tough stains off easily when cleaning the bathrooms
4,Harlequin debut book,"This was the first Harlequin book that Maureen Child wrote. I was fearful that it might be a little dated, but was pleasantly surprised! There was one reference to tapes, and CDs, but it did not hinder the enjoyment of the book at all."
3,"Choosing a college-start with a book, then interact with the school","John Zmirak's ""Choosing the Right College"" provides an interesting collection of useful information on a selection of the leading US universities/colleges. Students and parents might find it a helpful tool to understand these specific schools. At the same time-- when a campus visit is either premature or impractical (geographic distances)- I can recommend a ""virtual college fair"" called CollegeWeekLive (www.collegeweeklive.com) which lets students and parents, guidance counselors connect and interact with admissions staff, undegrads at 200+ colleges/universities and watch videos of live presentations from admissions experts. There are lots of great tools to help in this process."
1,THIS BOOK IS FOR CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN FANATICS.,"This book contains reviews that are blatantly slanted against liberals of all kinds. It jeers at colleges and universities that have, support, or require courses in ethnicity, women's studies, african studies, or gay and lesbian studies. There is little tolerance for liberals in the authors and it shows in their reviews of some of the best colleges in the country. There is unhindered sarcasm in the voice of the authors, who are obviously right wing christian fanatics who believe things like feminism, sexual intercourse, and non-white people are all threats to America. This book is a shameful scar on the face of America. Because of its right wing bias I cannot give it more than one star, and even that is giving it too much credit. I urge you, there are better, more tolerant college guides out there."
4,Best one for the price,"I spent several months of research before I decided on this one which had the best picture for the price. I saw a Philips that I really liked but it was too big (10"" screen). I really liked the features of the 8.9"" Toshiba but the off-angle viewing was horrible!!! This LS90 has some good features (6 hr battery, car adaptor and good off-angle viewing). The picture quality could be better. . .when viewed up close you can see blocky characteristics, but they disappear when viewed at normal distances.Overall, very decent."
3,Overpriced,"I bought this item because of the long battery life. Shame on me for assuming that by buying the most expensive portable I would be getting all the bells and whistles. Even $100 el-cheapo players include video inputs...not the LS90. I was looking forward to using it to review home videos and pictures while on vacation. The sound, picture and battery life are all first rate but the LS91 has all this AND AV inputs. For $100 less than the LS90 it's a no-brainer. The only difference I can find is the LS91 doesn't include a remote. If you can't live without it--buy a universal remote at Walmart for $15."
3,excelent but buyer beware,As a previos buyer of the panasonic DVDLS55...I received the dreaded H03 message...I called panasonic and was told it would cost $250 to repair it...I purchased the LS90 from another vendor with a 4 year extended warranty...If you buy this player do that also...3 business companions of mine have received the H03...Great product here but protect your investment people....It took 1 1/2 years for me to receive the message and believe me you will get yours also!
2,"Great features, poor picture","I love everything about this unit except the picture. The adjustable screen, the color saturation, and the battery life are great. But if a DVD player doesn't deliver a good picture--and this one doesn't--then the only reason to buy it is if it's competitive on price. This one is expensive, and there are less expensive units out there with better pictures. I'm returning mine. If you're not picky about the picture or it's for your kids, it might be okay."
5,A Year and a Half Old And No Problems,"I have had this player for over a year and a half and have never had a single problem with it, and I have used it almost every day since I bought it. The picture quality is excellent. It has a good size screen and is very light weight. I put it on my lap and watch it lying down in bed, and it is excellent for this purpose. You need to use earphones with it in order to get the maximum from your battery. You can also purchase a more powerful battery that gives you over 13 hours between charging. When you turn on the player it automatically resumes playing where it was when you turned the machine off. No need to push any buttons to memorize your place.I'm a totally satisfied customer."
1,"After 90 days, $200 gets you a replacement","Worked well for a short time. After the 90 day full warranty, however, returning my unit to the Service Center in Texas yielded an offer of $200 plus shipping for a replacement refurbished unit. Given that price, you would have shelled out well over $500 for a portable player and only have another 90 days of coverage."
4,Great Features,"Bought the Panasonic LS90 based on the battery life, screen size and ability to play numerous formats. Great marks on all accounts and the tilt screen is superb for use on airlines where the seat pitch is thin and you want to have a reasonable eye distance to the screen. The unit is a breeze to use and very intuitive in its operation. The only negative would be the disappointing screen resolution which is OK but not as good as some of the others available. I bought the higher capacity battery and get upwards of 9 hours of play time which is great for the international flights. Overall, very pleased with the player."
4,Fit for the simple man,"This watch is everything you might expect it to be. some may say the band is small, or too short, but if you're like me and a bit on the small side (135-40lbs and wrists small enough for my thumb and middle finger to touch when i wrap them around my wrist), then its just the right size for you.my ONE CON about this watch is that it is pretty loud for a watch. If i leave it in my room while I'm sleeping, i can hear it ticking throughout the night. My girlfriend notices it more than i do. so on quiet days, this watch can be a nuisance, but if your out and about, it works fine and looks good."
3,Good for its price,"I like this watch, but it definitely seems cheap. Even though the strap says its leather its only the upper part and it doesn't even look or feel like leather. I'm a small woman and the watch band just barely fits me so I could see how it might be small for a larger man. I like the look of the watch though and that is has time and date."
5,Great Looking Watch,"I was looking for a simple, nice looking watch with a day, date feature and a night light. This one fits the bill perfectly. If you don't need a stopwatch and all the fancy features on most digital watches then I highly recommend this retro Timex watch."
3,A descent watch,"It looks good, but it is so hard to change the date. And week and date does not match. I'm a little bit disappoint about it."
5,get the one with the brown leather band and gold casing....,"This is a great little watch for not much money. But to get the best of the Timex Easy reader watches be sure to specify you want the Easy Reader with the brown leather band and brass/gold cassing surrounding the face of the watch. I have seen similar Timex watches at Target with a black leather band and a silver cassing and they looked CHEAP......It also has a special lighting feature that allows you to light the face in the dark.......very cool and it also has a day of week window and a day of month window. As they say in NYC ""such a deal""."
1,what a disappontment,"I have been purchasing Timex watches for years, and will never purchase another watch again EVER. It did not do as it claimed. To begin, i was unable to set the day...it wouldn't set. (i had to wait for the day on the watch before i could start it). i had bought the watch for it's ability to light up in the dark.. that feature was virtually unusable . Amazon was great , took it back, and followed up,"
5,Better than I anticipated.,"I am very hard on watches. I was looking for easy read,leather strap and price. I got that a day/date, indiglo, and 10 yr battery. Simple,reliable and rugged."
1,Poor Quality,"I have been purchasing Timex watches for over 40+ years, and will never purchase another again EVER. I have purchased 5 of these watches in the last year and not one did as it claimed. Everyone of them had a problem with the water resistant seal. I don't swim, bath, etc. with them on only wash my hands - TIMEX definitely as gone the way of corrupt corporate America. Quality is not even in the equation."
2,"You get what you pay for,,,,,,","Ask me one year from now.... If it's still ticking,great.... What do ya want from a $30.00 Watch ?"
2,"i love this watch, look of it. battery DIED after 1 week!",battery died after 1 week. the look of the watch is great. just the fact that i had to replace the watch battery after only 1 week is complete bulls***
4,I think this is one of the greatest love songs of our time.,"I've been a fan of freestyle and R&B songs for a while now and the fact that a fellow Filippino group is out there making hits just makes it that much better. The words to the song just makes anyone want to stay! The freestyle mix to the song is mixes great for any party and I definitely recommend the whole album to those who love R&B, slow jams and freestyle. I DJ for local parties and this song,"" Say You'll Stay"" is always requested. I give it a thumbs up! Keep up the good work Kai!!."
4,Worthwhile,"It can be difficult to discuss electronic music, but if it helps you assess this review, I am most interested in what people term psy trance or goa trance; my favorite trance CD of all time is the classic ""Voyage into Trance."" I prefer faster trance because I use it for running. I have not been happy with some of the newer trance stuff, or new Oakenfold, for instance, but I enjoyed this CD, and am liking it more all the time. I think it grows on you. All the tracks are listenable for the long haul, i.e. none are annoying or unlistenable, so you can play this CD while working or on car trips all the way through. The majority are very good. You can't get a strong sense of them on the clips, but tracks 3 and 9 are excellent, and I have extracted them for running."
4,Taking turns others don't,"Meehan's book is nine chapters, nine stories beginningwith his freshman year at MIT in 1957. He goes in thearmy, he goes around the world to Thailand, he goesdown the world to Chile. I could not stop followinghim. He really has no extraordinary adventures; whatmakes the book extraordinary is his power of observingand reflecting on himself and what happens around him.He has a special appeal as a subject since he seems tooccasionally go out of control but never out of focus.Maybe his years investigating the stability of land tohold dams and support buildings have benefited his hugeliterary talents. There is something very special aboutthese stories. The book has a shocking ending where heseems to promise the reader that he is finishinghimself off in a lucrative dreariness in Palo Alto, butthen if you remember the book's beginning you see thathe thrives by taking turns others don't.--Steve Baer Coevolution Quarterly"
4,The Inner Life of the Middle Class by kd196310301,"I came across Barbara Ehrenreich's books by chance through an assignment for a course by a professor. The first book was ""Nickel and Dimed"", and found it thought-provoking, especially being a single mother and being there. This book shows the that the middle class is shrinking-now, in today's times-it's more like the working-class and the working poor. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. I am now reading her book, ""Global Woman"" and picked up ""Bait and Switch"". She writes to relate to the working person and understands their plight and struggle of ""robbing Peter to pay Paul."""
1,child's black and white striped tights,I am very disappointed with these tights. They actually ran a hole while I tried to take out the cardboard insert that was inside of one of the legs.They are very thin and will not hold up with any kind of wear at all
3,Incomplete complete guide to the Bible.,"This book contains various essays about different aspects of literary structure of the Bible. Is this complete guide to the Bible? Not at all! The title of this book is too big for this item. It seems this book is like a collection of lectures from the Bible conference. Quality of essays are uneven. Some essays are excellent, but some are so so."
5,Awesome,This Gear Shift Knob is so freaking awesome. All of my friends dig it. IT is very durable and looks great. Easy installation.Highly Recommended.
1,Don't Bother: Gets Loose in Less Than 24 Hours,"Nice looking but needs work to install on a any type of regular sedan vehicle.Comes with screws that need a lot of work to fit, and a junky allen wrench.got loose in less than a day. lots of work to tighten and maintain.A competitor could clean up by making a better version. Don't waste your money."
2,TORN,I GAVE THIS 2 STARS NOT BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY BUT BECAUSE IT IS NOT FOR JUST ANY AUTOMATIC SHIFTER BAR. I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY AND THIS KNOB JUST WOULD NOT FIT. I DOES NOT JUST SCREW ON AND YOU ARE DONE. YOU HAVE TO SECURE A PIECE ONTO THE SHIFTING BAR WITH ALLEN SCREWS. THE THREADED HOLES FOR THESE WERE NOT DRILLS ALL IN THE SAME SPOT AROUND THE SHEATH OR PART. SO IT WOULD NOT SECURE. I TRIED DRILLING THE HOLE IN THE RIGHT SPOT BUT IT BECAME UNTHREADED AND WOULDNT WORK. I FINALLY HAD TO DRILL A HOLE UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE PIECE TO MAKE IT WORK. I WOULD HAVE RATED IT HIGHER BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET IT ON IT LOOKS REALLY COOL BUT I HAVE TO REALLY RIG THIS UP TO MAKE IT WORK.
3,pretty cool,pain in the ace to install correctly (wiggles and moves around if not done right) i put mine in my scion tc and it looks pretty sick
2,does not fit jeep cherokee automatics and the finish flakes,"this knob does not fit any jeep cherokee with an automatic transmission in the years 96 to 2001. the gear selectors diameter is too large for the knob to slide on with no modification, then the paint and metal on the knob itself wore away. i do not recommend this unless you are willing to really modify your oem selector."
3,"Cool, but huge!","I got this product and it was literally the coolest looking thing ever...but if you don't have a huge gear shaft. You shouldn't get it. It's huge! I'm a big guy and it was really big in my hand. Good product, but if you have a small hear shaft. It's not for you."
3,looks cool,Looks bad a** in my lancer it is VERY difficult to install had to invent parts to get it to work.Not recomended for inept people.
3,Great item but not compatible for my car..,I purchased this item for a 94 Chevy Camaro manual transmission.The product is great quality comapred to replicas of it that I've seen at your local Walmart.I could not use the product for my auto because the base would not fit over my existing shift knob.Some friends of mine said it could be filed down to fit but even still it would sit too high.
1,Hollywood comes to the bayou,My buddy just came back from an alligator hunt in Florida. He laughed at the bogus portrayal in Swamp People. No firearms allowed in a Florida gator hunt.
2,Stupid slaughter,"I thought this would be about the life style of swamp people. But the aligator hunting is just a slaughter, no real skills involved. They put chicken out with big hooks the day before, and come up and shoot them at point blank. If you research the aligator hunting regulations for LA you find out that all of these guys have to OWN the land they hunt on or are paid by the land owner to hunt there. The guy that killed 180 last year was a guide or something, there is no other way to have killed that many unless you are hired by the land owner to cull his crop of gators. This is not hunting in any true sense of the word unless you think that the workers in the beef plant are hunting too.The show is monotonous and like watching a slaughter house operation. Even at the low price it was a disapointment."
3,Timex watch,"OK for what it is, a watch with day and date. But just OK. The day and date scroll is slow, finally clicks into correct placement around 0200 in the morning. The back lit dial is very dark, difficult to read due to placement of the day-date panel. Would re-think buying a black dial face in the future. Just too dark to read easily."
4,Timex Eay Reader,"I have owned this model Timex for about the last 12 or 13 years. I've found it to be surprisingly accurate in time-keeping, comparable to the much more expensive brands. The indiglo lighting is a plus feature. Having owned four of these models, I will point out that the water resistancy usually allows moisture into the case after about four years of constant year-round use including swimming, snorkeling and showering. Their reasonable cost makes it prudent to simply replace with similar model, even though the invading moisture doesn't seem to affect the performance, (my second watch still is ticking away in a drawer after eight years of being replaced due to moisture). One additional minor complaint would be the setting procedure for day and date. It's somewhat cumbersome and should be made simpler."
4,Retro Cool,"This watch is Retro Cool - you grandpa might have worn this in the 1970's.Got it today at WalMart for $28.92. I like the blue face and spartanly simple dial.Planned to immediately put it on a green canvas strap, but found I actually like the silver expansion band! I last wore an expansion band in 1970. The watch and expansion band have slim profile and won't trip you up walking through a doorway like a lot of the trendy 42+ mm watches. This watch has a pleasingly classic appearance. Still might put it on the green canvas band later, though."
5,Great for older eyes,"This is just what I needed. Bigger, easy to read numbers and looks classy too. Band's a little tight but that can be replaced."
3,Arrived as promised,"The watch arrived on time a promised. Although my 16 yr old son really loved it, unfortunately he lost it within two hours of receiving it,so we don't know if actually worked well or not. The band was much too big for him, and it wasn't clear whether or not the links were removeable. I will take that into consideration before I order another watch."
5,Nice classic watch,"Great price for a no nonsense timepiece, It clearly tells me the time,day and date and that's all I need. The indiglo feature is great too. Both the watch and the metal band look like they will last a long time."
5,Great,"This watch is better than other more expensive watches. For the price, you get a long life battery, a great design and a watch that is water proof. Will keep this seller in mind for the future."
3,Band came undone after 2 weeks,The watch is as expected and fit my wrist well - I'm a guy with large hands but relatively small wrists. A few days ago the band came undone at one end - the pin apparently popped out of its little holes in the case. The holes look pretty shallow so perhaps not that surprising. I put it back in and we'll see how it does -- no problems in the last 4-5 days. This was alarming because I bought this watch after the band on my old Timex broke repeatedly.
3,An Okay Watch,This watch is priced reasonably but it is not easy to adjust the date quickly. The first one I received had problem so I had to ship it back to get another. Amazon handled the problem smotthly.
3,Actually 3.5 stars,"You'll dig this thing if you liked Veruca Salt's early Breeders-on-steroids sound better than their subsequent Louise ""Lita Ford II"" Post-led rawk posing. Released as a stop-gap measure between American Thighs and Eight Arms to Hold You, BIOYAIVS has four tracks, all featuring that awesome raw 'n dry Albini production. No, it's not for VS newbies (get American Thighs and the ""Number One Blind"" single first) but completists will want this EP for its oh-so-sexy sleeve and otherwise unreleased songs. 3.5 stars."
4,"great toy, poor packaging",this toy was great for my little trekkie but unfortunatly it was missing the stand that it was supposed to come with. That was disappointing to him but he still plays with it. He has the borg cube with the stand and it would have looked great with the Enterprise STANDING next to it.
5,Spark People: 28 Day Boot Camp,Good and moving work out. You will sweat and feel invigorated. Just keep moving the best you can and it will help take the weight and inches off.
5,Your personal gym in a box,"For someone who has two left feet this is the ideal workout DVD for me. Not only were the instructions and cues on par, but I loved that they were not overshadowed by loud music. Coach Nicole has a confidence that exudes from the screen that makes me believe that with just a little time and effort I am making strides to become the healthiest me I can be. And when one level gets too easy, guess what, it doesn't stop there--there's another challenge waiting to be achieved. So if you don't have time to travel to the gym, pop this in to the DVD player and you are one step closer to AWESOMENESS!"
4,Good Workout!,This DVD workout is hard enough for more advanced people and with the modifications for beginners. I think that if you are very new to exercise you may have to do a few minutes of each work out untill you are able to get through the full workout. I do think it is worth a try. I bought mine from Target because of the 3$ off coupon and a code to get 250 spark points from the purchase.
3,complicated,I like the structured approach but the moves are hard for me to follow and keep up with. No complaints with the processing and shipment of product.
3,Hard to Follow,"This video might be ok once I do it many times, but to get started, is very difficult to follow. Also, I don't see anywhere where it tells you how to do this as a 28 day boot camp. It appears to just be a typical excercise video. Glad I didn't pay full price."
1,Not for beginners,"I've spent 7 days trying to follow the first day's video. I only have 45 minutes in the mornings to spend exercising and spend the entire 45 minutes trying to get through the first ten. I have to keep stopping rewinding. Coach Nicole, I wouldn't weigh 210 and be joining a 28 fitness boot camp for beginners if I knew what a mamba was or if I was able to do a new exercise move every ten seconds. Wish I hadn't spent 12.99 on another dust collector. Should be titled, will take 28 days to figure out day one, unless you are already a fitness expert and don't need this DVD."
1,Try Another Exercise DVD,"This is far overpriced for what it offers. Not a challenge, boring overall and far to easy. I expect a DVD to have moves that are new and innovative. Why in the world did I pay for a run of the mill DVD with moves from the 90's? Big mistake! There are far too many great DVD's out there for less money, offering much more motivation with moves & exercises that will challenge the body-mind-as well as give the incentive to look forward to doing the DVD another day. This DVD is a TOTAL let down, save your $$ & invest in a better workout DVD...not this one!"
5,"Any one, any size can do this!","What is so nice about this exercise DVD is that it gives you options according to your fitness level. Coach Nicole starts out with a beginners modification and she tells you when you feel you are ready you can progress to the intermediate, and when you are ready move to the next level, the advanced workout. It is all up to you. You always see a person in this DVD demonstrating your fitness level in the DVD.The total workout is 84 minutes but you get to pick and choose if you want to do the entire workout or just a few components. The components consist of a 6 min. warm up, 12 min. Cardio Burst, 12 min. Cardio Sculpt, 20 min. Tone and Burn, 30 min. Total Body Challenge, and a 4 min. cool down."
4,Good Video,Good video. It would have been wonderful if the video included written guide to tell you the different segments represented. The exercises are great to get a good work. It would have been helpful to know before purchase that most of the segments include weight training as well.
1,TB525CS,"I've had this product for almost 3 years now and deeply regret not returning it the first year. I thought it was me - didn't know how to start it. Well, after I've had couple of my friends try it and have as much luck as I did, I am now convinced that it is NOT operator issue, it's the product. I like the fact that I don't have to mix fuel & oil, and I like the fact that I could buy other attachments and have a multi-purpose tool. However, none of that has any value when I can't start the darn thing. It looks like new, but I will be forced to trash it and buy another one. Does anyone have a brand & model to recommend? I would like to stay with 4-cycle gas models - but something that starts easily and reliably. Many times I got myself all ready to trim, with long pants, longs sleeves, eye goggles, gardening gloves, you name it, only to come to the same sad conclusion as the last time - the darn thing will not start. I think this is the last Troy Built tool I'll ever spend my money on."
1,A Real Piece of Junk,"It took at least a hundred pulls on the starter cord to get the trimmer running, I thought it would be easier the second time I used it, but it took just as many pulls. Even when the engine is hot it is hard to start. I return the 1st trimmer and replaced it with another figuring it must be defective. I've never been able to get the second one started and will be returning it tomorrow. I'll be replacing it with another brand."
4,Great Value,"I had been looking to replace an old 2-cycle trimmer fro some time, but prices for 4 cycle models were holding me back. I was looking at some year end closeouts on Echo brand trimmers but they were still too expensive. Got this model for $70 shipped from Amazon. I order before a trip and it wasn't supposed to ship until I returned, but it was shipped and deliverd before I got back!The trimmer itself is fine, I saw the exact same model at Lowe's for ~$170. It's a little tricky to start, you have to follow the directions exactly. Idle speed required a little adjustment or motor stalled when idling. Has clutch so trimmer stops running at idle.One annoyance: to disconnect the spark plug for winter storage, the protective cage around it required loosening about 6 screws. But for the price, I'll do that once a year."
1,Troy Bilt Line Feed Problem,"Like everyone else I too have had problems with the line feed on this model (TB525CS). Specifically, after a couple of bumps the line seems to come out all at once. Being of a curious nature I disassembled the head completely and discovered the root of the problem. There is a spring loaded mechanism that is supposed to regulate how much string is released in a bump. What happens is this mechanism starts to stick due to a poor design involving a circlip and a weak spring.Long story short after putting a washer under the circlip and adding a much stronger spring at the base this is actually a very capable head. I never had any problems with the engine so I am pretty happy now. I still have to give this product one star because no one should have to go through this much work to make a product function like it is supposed to."
3,"Works well, but has problems","Once you get this started, it seems to do well. The trouble that I had was the string getting jammed inside the spool continuously. I would feed the lead out a few times but after that the string retracted itself inside the spool and the only way to get it out was to take the spool apart and manually wind it. Taking the spool apart was a huge pain as if the string is jammed inside, one of the pinchable tabs on the side will not push in and you risk breaking the thing trying to pry it open.I returned it and ordered a cordless trimmer instead."
5,easy starts,"super good item no problems with it i like it over the 2 stoke systems you need oil with, this is quit and easer to start"
1,Line feed problem,"Great little engine. Starts easy and runs smooth and is relativly quiet. But that bump head line feeder makes it all for naught! Like so many others posting here, I can only go 6 to 12 feet before having to remove the bump head cover (not easy!), rewind the line, then reinstall the bump head cover. And getting that cover to snap back in place is even more frustrating than getting the damn thing off in the first place! I'd return it but I dont know what I'd buy to replace it. I dont get along with 2 cycle engines (i've sworn to never own another). The motor on my old electric Ryobi gets so hot it burns my ribs so electric is out too. So its either 4 cycle or let the grass continue to grow across the side walk. Someone told me Honda makes a 4 cycle but I've been afraid to even look at the price."
1,"Absolute piece of crap, do not buy","I've owned a lot of trimmers in my time and the Troy-Bilt TB525 EC is the worst of all of them. Just bought it brand new a couple months ago. First time using it, it took about 50-60 pulls to get it started. I figured ""hey it'll be easier to start next time"". Nope. Just it took close to 100 pulls the second time. In the time it takes me to start this piece of crap, I could've already been done with my yard work. I will never, ever drop a dime on a Troy-Bilt product again and I'll be sure to tell my friends & family to do the same."
1,Worthless trimmer and company,"I purchased a TB525 Ec and it has never worked properly. The company is even worse they don't care. I spoke to customer service person today and his comment was ""have a nice life."" The head does not feed string properly requiring me to go back into the garage, disassemble the head and fix it. This happenes every 5 minutes or so. After about a year of ownership and 90 minutes of use, if that much, the motor does not turn fast enough for the string to cut grass. The motor stalls and dies. The gas is fresh, the air filter clean and the fuel filter replaced and it still does not run. Squeeze the trigger ad the engine dies. Troy -Bilt comment on that, the world make bad gas these days. Troy bilt does not honor their warranty, neither does its parent MTD products. It is better ti use sizzers."
2,"the first one that ordered, the shaft sheered","i finally got to use my new troy built a few days after i received it. i filled it with oil and gas and crancked her up per the instructions and away i went to cut some high grass around a stump when 15 min into cutting it just quit. it felt hot so i let it cooled down about an hour. tried to restart and the pull felt loose. thinking it was a safty feature to let it cool or reset i let it set till the evening and the pull was still loose, i had the husband look at it and the neighbor and both said that the shaft was sheered. i was upset and then horrified that i couldnt return it after putting gas and oil into it. but after contacting amazon, they replaced it fully. and i am greatful for that."
2,"Great power head, bad trimmer, low reliability and quality control","I've owned a TB425CS for three years. I really liked it until the curved shaft trimmer cable broke and I couldn't get a replacement from Troy-Bilt. I tried a Ryobi universal replacement trimmer attachment but it was worthless. So, I bought the new almost identical TB525 (that's how much I liked the TB425). Right out of the box I noticed part of the plastic handle was broken. So I decided to at least try the trimmer attachment with my TB425 power unit. It worked for about 1 minute before the string completely disappeared into the hub. I retrieved it from the hub and tried again but this time the string fed out of the hub unrestricted and twisted around the shaft. Re-read the instructions and reloaded a few times with the same result. I could easily pull the string out of the hub with my hands. Returned product. Very disappointed with Troy-Bilt now."
1,Do Not Buy,This is a horrible trimmer. The line feed is a nightmare and replacing the string is as bad. I would never buy another troybilt.
1,Spool Head Flew Apart!!,"Bought b/c of the four-cycle (no oil mix) design. Have had unit for about two months and have used on the yard about six times. I have had nothing but problems with the spool head (see so many other reviews with same problem) with string jamming. Finally, the head flew apart!!. Troy Built Customer (lack of) Service is not helpful. refered me to a Service Center that is no longer open!!! I just wanted a new spool head and would replace it myself but they would not help at all. STAY AWAY FROM THIS JUNKY MACHINE. Thank you..."
1,Troy Bilt 525 ec,"Save yourself time and money, this product makes you re-adjust the line every ten feet while trimming. The line continually breaks off and you have to restring it. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!"
2,Won't buy again,"The Troy-Bilt TB525CS I bought lasted just out of warranty and was an absolute bear to start the whole time I had it. It would always start, but it would take a minimum of 15 pulls when it was hot outside and upwards of almost 30 when it was cold (always would leave a blister due to the hard pulls). Dealer said that was due to the 4 stroke engine but ""I was helping the environment"".Well this time I'm buy something else and I'm going back to a two stroke! ""Heck with the environment""!!!"
4,TB525CS working fine since 2007,"Granted it's a previous model, but the engine probably hasn't changed. If anything, the trimmer starts better now than when it was new. It also works well with the pole saw attachment I purchased recently. The only bummer is that the saw cost almost what the trimmer did a few year back.I do recommend this unit. No need to reiterate the tradeoffs for 4-cycle vs. 2-cycle engines.I suspect mine has been pretty reliable because I:* Run the trimmer dry of gasoline after every use* Use fuel stabilizer* Use gas that's less than a month old"
4,875r Awesome after 4+ years,"I am debating whether to purchase this newer version since I am having a hard time departing fromt he old 875r model, 4 cycle trimmer. This trimmer served me well for nearly 5 years with weekly use and routine maintenance. Unfortunately the shaft where the attachments connect to drive ewach attachment is stripped...not sure about buying the part for $40 and trying to replace it. If my attachments work on this model, I will geta new one, no question. Very very satisfied with this product, and the attachments make it worth it all. Won yard of the quarter in my neighborhoood thanks to the Ryobi 875r!"
1,Bad trimmer and service,"I bought this trimmer 12/20/07, after three times of uses the engine exhausts a lot of smock, my wife brought it to Bills repair center for service the tech told her that we put too much oil, I was using the bottle of oil that comes with the unit. I myself brought it in the next week, the Owner Bills told me that it is a piece of junk and suggest me either buy a new of throw it away, I insisted to repair and left it in store. It has been there more than a month, eveytime I call for information, the answer is always back order for part and can not provide when the part will arrive, currently the trimmer still in the store waiting for part. This is not a good trimmer and very bad service."
1,troy-bilt,"Don't bother with this, it's total junk.....used it 3 times, never did start right, (followed instructioins to the letter)...what a joke. The trim line constantly breaks and tangles, like others have said. Requireing complete removal, de-tangle and re-string. Took it to the dump today, which is where it belongs. I would not even ""give away"" this problem to someone else....Troy Bilt, you got me once, never again!!"
1,Not a good trimmer,"I chose this trimmer since I also have a 4 cycle leaf blower by the same company which works great. The trimmer was horrible. Starting the engine was much more difficult than my last Homelite, but the worst problem was related to the feeding of the trimming line. In 10 minutes of trimming, I had to stop and disassemble the head three times because the line became tangled inside. This happened the next time I used it as well. I returned it to Lowes and bought a Husqvarna 223L which works perfectly."
2,Sheared-off Shaft,"I loved this machine...for 2 and a half years of quiet running, easy-operating use. And then the crank sheared off. End of machine. Think of the crankshaft in a car or a motorcycle: it is supported in bearings at both ends. But in this engine the crank is supported in only one bearing and the piston rod is connected to an eccentric counterweight on the opposite end of that crank, which protrudes only about an inch or so out of the bearing. But it's long enough to shear off. I think the basic design is not a bad one, but the steel of the crank must be made stronger or of greater diameter. Still, I'd love to have a 4-cycle string trimmer; Honda makes one, but it's far too expensive."
4,Handy reference for iconography,"I use this book as a reference when I am designing icons. I wish it were more thorough, particularly for traffic symbols, but it's better than any other book that I've found."
1,It is not Safe Act Updated.,"The book is the 2004 original book without updates to new rates, guidelines or SAFE ACT. Not one, I repeat not one Safe Act comment or update. The book has 2004 information. Please stop advertising that it is SAFE ACT updated!!!!!!!I am an NMLS licensed loan originator. If it is SAFE ACT updated then you are sending out the original inventory and not the latest version."
3,"It is a goob book, but too expensive for what it is","This book is a very good tool for new loan officers. It is a good book, but you can find the same information in other books that are more reasonabaly priced. I would have given it a higher rating, if it was priced below [money]. It was just disappointing to receive such a thin book in the mail for [money]."
2,Not very good in comparison,"It tasted like fake bananas. I gave it a try because I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE all of the other sugar-free, fat-free flavors I've tried. This one is the worst. I finished it because I had made it, but you would have to force me to eat it again. I do not recommend. Although, some people like the weird, fake flavor of banana. If that's you, then you'd probably like this."
5,Great Beginers Book!,"This is a great book if you want to dable on herb, oil and infusions. It covers alot of info and gives you pointers on where to find your ingredients. The book has a lot of juicy tidbits on how to substitute herbs and oil in his recipees, without harming the effectiveness of it. Also a cool Soap section! I cannot wait to start making his soaps. I recommended it higly is informative and its cheap. Check out a couple of his other books. Wicca:a guide for the solitary practitioner and The Magical Household. These books are also full of information and easy to read."
2,Para los que se creen magos,"Una cosa es ser wicca (como lo era cunningham) y otra es vestirse de negro, ponerse un sombrero, sacar este libro y reírse agudamente mientras agita el caldero... eso es este libro, es el perfecto complemento para un brujo, viene un recetario mágico, hasta muñequitos tipo vudú... si crees que la magia es hacer hechizos y jugar a ser harry potter, ¡este libro es para tí! Lo único práctico por lo que no he tirado el libro a la basura es por que me dice él procedimiento para hacer mis propios inciensos y jabones, y aceites, pero para mí, el resto del libro me salió demasiado caro para lo que buscaba... pensé que cunningham era más serio...no valió los casi 20 dólares que me costó con todo y envío.."
2,It's Been Done,Sooo many times before. I fast forwarded through most of it and I know I still got the story right.
3,Outdated but still useful,"I learned some useful tips from Woolley about the genre of historical fiction, and especially writing dialogue, but given its age and price, wasn't surprised to find that a great deal of the book about research and marketing was totally outdated. Today there's much more access on the internet to so much in the way of historical material, scholarly communities and images than when this was written. Second, the ""how to sell"" part is entirely out of date, now that so many options are open to writers via independent publishing platforms. Third, I got a little tired of reading her examples from her own work-in-progress. I would have enjoyed her spreading herself more widely across lots of historical periods and really explore other writers' styles more."
5,Izze is a favorite with teens!,"My teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon! They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy. I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found Izze.I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling clementine soda. Nothing beats an icy, cold Clementine Izzy on a picnic. The clementine flavor goes well with a nice thick sandwich and a handful of chips, but it is also great just by itself.My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop! I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze."

5,"Finally, we found a quality speaker!!","Great, great sound. Our praise/worship team is very happy!!The sound clean and crisp. Everyone can hear themselves.We bought two. I think we should have bought a third one.We got it for $250...not sure if anyone is selling it for cheaper.Now matter what, we are very satisfied.!!"
3,"Good sound, questionable build quality","I bought one of these as a drum monitor for my church. We already owned 2 of these, bringing the total to three. The speakers are decent sounding units but the problem is with the Speakon jacks. The jacks fail a lot and all three of our monitors have at least one of the jacks broken. It' not the way we handle the cable either or the way we handle the unit as it's mostly immobile.All in all a good sounding speaker but be extra careful how you plug the cables in."
4,Great Buy,"This is a great stage monitor. It has decent output and really makes the vocals crystal clear. No more fighting to be heard over the guitars.The shipping from this company was fantastic. I think I received the package within 5 days of ordering it. It was inside a large box, secured with plastic rip tags and bundled up inside plastic protective wraps inside the box. It's heavy. Be aware.The only issue I have with this stage monitor is it needs to be hooked up with a wire. I wish it was wireless so that I wouldn't have to worry about overloading our circuits.It does not come with a cover.Overall, great buy. If I wanted a wireless, I should have done more extensive research on the product. It's my fault, so I can't really complain too much."
3,Needs better book cover design,"I had this book. I sold the book. I couldn't stand to have a book or read a book that constantly was staring me in the face w/ a big ol' grumpy brat. I know it may be silly... but really, I'd just rather read something else. It doesn't make it appealing. It's depressing. I need hope & encouragement. Show me the happy face we'll have when I'm done applying the book, ya know. I suppose I could have gotten a book cover... but... I just suggest author/ publisher keep such things in mind."
4,Mat test is sussessful,after reviewing the material in the guide i was able to get a high score on the Mat test!
5,The BEST and ONLY pan no kitchen should be without!,"Of the top 5 pans that no kitchen should be with out, the ALL-Clad MC2 saute pan is tied for number one in my book. Not only does the Master Chef 2 line cook better then ALL-Clad's ""bread and butter"" stainless line, it's also less expensive. Sauteing, shallow frying, poaching, steaming, you name it this pan can do it. I'm not a big fan of buying cookware sets, and that's why i purchased this pan seperately and paid the price, but its worth every penny. Cooking in this saute pan produces an incredible ""fond"" (little bits of food particles), that when deglazed, produce an extraordinary pan sauce. This is something I would NEVER want to cook without. In fact, I plan on willing it to my children so they can have the same enjoyment that I have had."
3,A bit disappointing,"The pan is certainly fine, and I expect to use it for decades. But as another review that I read had warned, the pan is not perfectly flat. Thus, your oil tends to rest along the outside circumference of the pan. I got tired of looking for a pan like this, so I settled for it. I was tired of the $60 junk that you have to toss after a few years and also did not want non-stick anymore. This cost only $220, which seemed like a deal compared to other high quality pans of this size, which are more than $400. But then again, not being flat is definitely less than ideal although I plan to live with it. Not sure there are any good alternatives."
1,I HATE this pan,"My mom bought me this pan for Christmas a few years ago and I absolutely hate it. It's the worst pan I've ever owned. Food sticks to it no matter how much oil or how low of heat I cook on. It is not balanced properly and I find it difficult to manage when full of food. The handle is too narrow and it makes it so you can't lift the pan with one hand. My husband used it the other night and ended up bruising his hand with the handle. Because the handle is hollowed out in the middle, all of the pressure is on the two points of contact that meet the hand. He can't even use his hand today. This pan went out in today's garbage. I wish my mom had saved her money."
4,2 extremely powerful parables of the human spirit,"These two great stories are written in that harsh realistic style so charateristic of Solzhenitsyn's works. Both stories are important on two fronts: They are both allow for primary-source insight into what many Westerners have a skewed perception of (the poverty and oppression in Stalanist Russia), and secondly, both stories present severe criticsm of human nature in such grand metaphoric form as to allow them to penetrate the reader's own soul. The phrase ""thought provoking,"" does these stories no justice, the parables are better described as painfully applicable."
3,"Beautiful Necklace, Unfortunate Mishap","I was shocked at the quality of the beading in this necklace upon receipt. The color is gorgeous and pops against any solid shirt. Unfortunately, the first time I wore it, the chain connecting the necklace to the clasp broke. I did not bother to return it, which I will admit is my own fault. Overall, it's a great looking piece!"
4,Good for the Price. Slight Modification Needed.,"The clips came as advertised. Be aware that they do come with some packing grease, not a ton, but enough that you wont want to wear a nice shirt when dealing with them. I had to modify each one by bending up the retaining clip and slightly pinching the clip to make the track more narrow. Both of these operations are very easily done with a pair of vice grips and took maybe 5 seconds per clip.Once loaded, it does take some force to push the rounds down into the firearm, but they all fed in and it was ready to go. An ideal way to store a large quantity of ammo for rapid deployment at a later date. Probably a waste of time if you are just shooting at the range. It's easier to just load the rifle directly (SKS anyway, cant speak for the AK).Overall, typical Chinese product. Cheap. Does the job. Don't expect perfection."
2,Not very good quality,I recently ordered these and only 6 out of 20 clips would work properly. I can not seem to get the others to fit in the gun. Maybe I just got a bad batch.
2,A little dissapointed,"The striper clips came in two plastic bags with 10 clips in each bag. I have opened one so far. Three of the clips were two wide to fit into the slot in the bolt face of my SKS. The other seven, I had to dremel a little so they would fit more smoothly. I hope pack number two is better."
3,Not for an Norinco SKS,"This package arrived early, and was properly packaged.These are great stripper clips; they hold 7.62x39 rounds quite well, are attractive, and strip out better than my type ""31"" clips. Sadly these do not fit the clip guide in any Norinco SKS. This is due to the Norinco SKS's style of clip guide.The tolerances for these clips are within less than .01mm of fully functioning ""31 clips; this is not the fault of the manufacturer, the machine used to stamp these was just off by an amount too small to detect by the human eye. (Perhaps it could even be a minute difference of shape).If one were to cut the edges of the clip guide on their bolt or spend a few evenings modifying the clips then they would have a perfectly acceptable product. I myself plan on modifying my 60 clips which I ordered; (it is a hobby after all).Acceptable product; sadly NOT acceptable FOR NORINCOS! Great seller! 3/5"
4,worked ok,"Had work on a couple to get the shells to feed out easily, but over all am happy with them"
2,stripper clips,"cheap, not the best quality...got what i paid for...after a little modifaction they work fine...would buy them again..."
1,Junk.,There is not enough reviews on here to call it research. Please go to the sks boards and see for yourself. I wish I had. All twenty clips had to be ground down on all corners to fit in my Tula sks. That only made the clip fit in the bolt. Next I had to grind the inside channels so the cartridges would be able to slide into the magazine. I only have about 6 that are going to work. The problems with these Ncstar clips are well known in the sks community. Buy military surplus instead. They work.
1,Misleading quantity,"I bought these thinking it was a pack. How ignorant of me. Its only one spark plug, so buyer beware. Because even though the description says pack and you think ""4 come in a pack"" I promise you they will only send you one. Also I was charged 2 separate shipping charges but the order came in just one package. So these guys have found a way to grab your money in two different ways. You've been warned."
4,Bud Abbott & Lou Costello 2 Hour Colgate Special,Eine amüsante Nostalgie DVD der Komiker Abbott & Costello über die man heute noch lachen kann. Die Bild-Qualität ist auf Grund der alten Aufnahmen aus den 50'ern nicht so gut.
4,"Partyin, dudes","it's latter-day Turbonegro: Loud, bombastic, paying tribute to the rock n roll animals of the 70s and 80s and all with a great sense of humor. it's no Apocalypse Dudes, but it's still better than 90% of the other stuff out there. And it's got Keith Morris singing along, what else do you want?"
2,One knee pad,I orded this for my mom becouse she like to skate. when we got it from ups and opened the box there was only one... what do you do with one knee pad??
3,"Good product, but very small","This seems liek a very well constructed product. Unfortunately, it runs quite small. It's probably great for most women or lightly built men."
2,Good product not suitable for amazon shipping,"This product is great. I like it and will continue to purchase it. But as it's shipped now by Amazon it is a problem. UPS lay the box upside down at my door step. Which meant a lot of the cleaning solution spilled out on to the shipping boxes (Clorox box was inside an Amazon box). Even the outer box was permeated with the cleaning solution. I am not sure how much of the cleaning solution was spilled, but it must be a lot since both boxes lids were soaked.Yes the price paid was very good and is a excellent product but if the cleaning solution is lost due to shipping issue then is not a good deal.The product needs canister needs to include an air tight customer removable shrink wrap between the lid and the actual towel. Then this problem could be solved. Until then I will buy this at Sam's Club."
3,Not streak free,"Clorox claiming these are streak free is a blatant lie. After sanitizing shiny surfaces with one of these wipes, I have to wipe them again with a paper towel and Windex to remove streaks."
5,Perfect clean up tool,"I hate that I love these so much, but they cut through things and are more efficient than a rag + soap.A note about shipping: The tops of 2 individual containers had popped open partially causing drying in one of the containers. There was no tape across the top of each container or plastic wrapping to prevent this."
3,Won't kill norovirus.,As far as I can tell these are good for general cleaning and disinfecting. I was thoroughly disappointed when I found out that these are ineffective against the norovirus. Especially since these were initially one of my main tools for disinfecting after my wife got sick. I had to reclean the infected areas with bleach and Lysol spray (Brand III).
4,Good price,It does exactly what it says it does and it very convenient to just pull them out instead of a rag and cleaner.
3,Basic Snow Suit,"I purchased this snow suit to replace a suit that I had grown out of last year. The zipper on my old suit was full length went down one leg ,metal and sturdier, this one is plastic. I wore the suit outside today in twentyone degree weather over clothes with a light sweater to blow snow and was comfortable. Like another reviewer I was covered with small feathers when I took the suit off. The zipper is a little short for me and makes it difficult to get on and off and the legs are 4-6"" longer then needed. I am 5' 11"" tall, 205 lbs., 40 inch waist, 30 inch leg length and I bought a size large, if you are bigger then me you may want to go to the next size up. For my purposes, blowing snow it is adequate and the price is not out of line."
5,Guide Gear Snowsuit,"I purchased this snowsuit for my mother. She had been searching relentlessly for a ""snowmobile suit"" to either find nothing or to find one that was way out of her price range. She has been extremely satisfied with the suit. She was skeptical at first because it is lightweight, but has been pleasantly suprised with its warmth. Our winters are extremely cold with termperatures reaching below zero. And living on a farm, it is necessary to brave the frigid temperatures. She is very happy with the product."
4,perfect snowsuit,The snowsuit is great. The legs were a little long. Put legs of snowsuit inside boots. All set!
3,Too Long,"The suit is well worth the cost and will be very warm, however, I an 5'8"" tall @ 180 lbs and I had to shorten the legs by 11 inches for the suit to fit me......pretty long don't you think?Thanks for your interest!DB"
2,Big sleeves,The only problem I have is with the sleeves that have no elastic to keep the wind out while riding my motorcycle.
3,Armor from the battle of Wisby,"For the amount of money paid for a new item, I am disappointed. The item is either used or has been on the shelf for years, showing age and wear. I was surprised to see that the package was so shoddily packed and not insured since the price was high."
1,Book Ok Binding destroyed,"I had read about this book and it's exhaustive detail for a while and took the plunge and purchased it. I avidly scanned the book after recieving and found that it had shipped with the binding damaged and hanging on the pages by a thin strip of gauze. It is a heavy book and it came without shrink wrapping around it. It appeared that somebody grabbed the books' hardcover and yanked it up and the hardcover actually ripped away from the bound pages. I supposed somebody could have fumbled it during the packing process as well, Either way I sent it back and got a full refund without problem. Disappointed as anyone would be when expecting a new book."
1,couldn't get past the first chapter,"I bought this book on the recommendations of others but when I got to the first chapter about how she discovered Toltec wisdom, I just couldn't believe the story of how she moved to California and within days a stranger, told her she she was a powerful teacher and healer. Then her timeline of getting a doctorate just three years later is questionable too. I looked on the book and it never said where she got this degree from.I did go on and read the rest of the book and some of the ideas seemed reasonable but the things from the first chapter made me think, why should I believe any of this?"
1,Baby? By the way I am an adult,"I don't understand why this companey advertises babys in MINI skirts. Babys are supposed to be cute, I'm not so sure if bratz babyz give that ""cute"" look. My 5 year old daughter's friends all have one. So she constantly complains about how she is the only one who dosn't have a bratz baby. I don't want her to get ideas of being a ""hot momma"""
4,i agree with anonymous,"hey quit harassing parents, okay? okay, if you don't like a review, just ignore it, buy your toy, and get on with life. that simple? see? perfect. thank you. bratz4ever! ;-)"
2,"Too much money, not worth it.","All I heard from my daughter was she had to have this doll. I personally have no interest in Bratz and passed this along to her but when I said that to her it just made her want it more. She worked everyday to make money for this doll. Her birthday was coming soon so I thought I would surprise her. After she opened it, it lasted the rest of the night and she has not touched it since. I personally think it is way too much money and the doll does not do anything. Not worth it."
2,An OK doll,"My neighbor has a small Bratz Babyz Cloe doll, and it's an OK doll for young kids. I honestly think they're ugly, and they're not really fun. Even though they're very durable, they seem like snobby-looking dolls. When I was into playing with dolls, they didn't have Bratz and I played with Barbie and Baby Born dolls. Barbie dolls are much better because they don't have faces that are ugly and irregular shaped. Also, Barbies aren't nearly as snobby-looking! Buy Barbies instead!!"
1,This doll's clothing is completely inappropriate...,"One of the Yasmine Bratz BABYs is wearing MESH THONG UNDERWEAR! I could not believe this. I bought a Yasmin for my 6-year old daughter yesterday, and I thought the doll was so adorable. However, my daughter pointed out to me the kind of underwear that the doll has on...it is inappropriate. First of all, these are Bratz BABIES...it's bad enough how the manufacturers have the original dolls dressed. I explained to my daughter how inappropriate it was; however, not all little girls have someone to explain this to them. The manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves. I'm not demanding a recall, as it is up to parents individually to decide what they deem appropriate...however, I believe it's fair to assume that most mothers and fathers would agree with me."
1,Pretty Doll/Horrible Outfits,"My three year old daughter just received this doll for her birthday. I had seen it in the store loved the face but did not buy it because the outfit was too revealing. I can't see why they dont put a cute jumper or capri outfit on them, would you dress a baby in that kind or outfit? Well much to my horror she received this doll and I accepted it until I saw that under her skirt was a black thong, A BLACK THONG???? who in the world made this doll and what were they thinking this doll is marketed to small children, kindergarten age it is way too inappropriate, I will keep this doll but I will find an appropriate outfit. Baby Bratz don't buy it unless you want your child to think dressing trampy is wonderful the skirt barely covers her tushy. I think this doll can make the news maybe shame on you, it deserves to get noticed. Way too sexy for children."
2,I think it looks rather weird,"Bratz Babyz don't look as nice or beautiful as the actual bratzdolls. Well anyway, that's what I think. For a start, their heads are huge, whilst their bodies are tiny, though their legs are tiny. And they don't wear nappies, they were very thin and skimpy knickers. So I prefer the actual teenage bratz dolls."
4,Can't they have their own collections!!!!!,I CAN NOT STAND BRATZ BABYZ. THEY ALWAYS COPY OFF THE ACTUAL BRATZ! ESPECIALLY THOSE BIG BABIES!!!!!!!!!!!THE ONLY BRATZ BABYZ I WILL EVER LIKE ARE THE BRATZ BABYZ WITH THE SOFT HAIR!!
2,Not for a Lifetime,"Make no mistake about it--this book is only a vacation guide. This is NOT the book to read if you are looking for a place for a ""Lifetime"" (as the subtitle would mislead you to believe.) This is not the book to read if you are considering relocating. It's reviews are very superficial and offer no information regarding school systems, retirement options, etc. As a vacation guide, I find there are better. The Away for the Weekend series by Eleanor Berman are more helpful."
3,"Good intro to the debugger, but partially out of date","This book does not teach you how to debug. It's essentially what the debugger documentation should have been 2 years ago.If you have never done any kernel debugging, this is a good starting point that will give you an overall undertanding of the process and the tools. However, now that Microsoft has rewritten all the debugger documentation, most of this information comes with the online documentation.The most unfortunate thing in my mind is that the most important chapter - remote debugging - has a major mistake in it: Figure 8-2 is wrong and will totally confuse the reader. Figure 8-2 should have the HOST machine located between the REMOTE and the TARGET machine."
1,"Outdated, Obsolete, Full of Typographical Errors","Don't even bother borrowing this book from the library. It is a waste of shelf space. My first clue should have been the book's website no longer exists.The debugging tools mentioned throughout the book have been updated (by several years) so the detailed information about their use is useless.The new versions of debugging tools come with help files that outclass this book at every turn. In fact, the book appears to be a poor interpretation of help files from previous versions of the tools.Upon close examination, the book is also full of seemingly minor errors that would cause great confusion to a reader trying to learn about debugging for the first time.I made it to Chapter 7 (skimming Chapters 5 & 6) before I decided to recycle (as in compost) my copy."
2,Where is the BEEF ?,"This book was a real disappointment. The book is 300 pages long, over 130 pages is a reference on WinDbg and Stop Codes. The remainder of the book(about 170 pages) is divided into 11 chapters which gives only a basic overview of kernel debugging. If you have ANY experience using WinDbg you will find this book almost worthless."
4,Walter Canis Inflatus,"What is a great and entertaining book in English is now a firm favourite with my son in Latin. He likes being able to follow the Latin using the english version written directly below. However the Latin requires someone who has reasonable proficiency in the language if you are wishing to directly translate and explain the Latin to a child and there is no helpful glossary. All in all, a great book - very quirky pictures but a firm favourite with my son."
1,nothing else than a dictionary,I found this product to be very disappointing. They are advertising this product as a translator (and selling it for the price of a translator) when in fact this device is nothing else than a dictionary - which may be bought at a fraction of this price from any other store. The few basic (kindergarten level) sentences included in this dictionary do not entitle the device to be a translator by any means!
3,Franklin TG-470 12 Language European Translator,"I purchased this translator for my niece, she is 9 years old and she learns English as a second language. But unfortunately, she is not satisfied with it, because she can not find many words to translate them. although, I think i might be useful while traveling."
2,It is Okay,Do not enjoy using this product. Very difficult to use. I was in Italy and there is no time to flip open the transalator look for that particular word to get an understanding.
2,Very limited dictionary,I was disappointed with how limited the dictionary was. As an example I tried to find the Spanish word for disaster. The best it could come up with was director. Maybe it didn't contain the word because it is a disaster!
1,Not acceptible item 12 Language European Translator,"Franklin EXPLORER FR-TVH12 12 Language European TranslatorThe 12 Language European Translator is a very slow device. It takes time to find a word in English and then it takes time to say that it can not find it in Russian. Even if it can find it, it not always gives correct translation.If you are looking for the words like a BOOK - this translator is for you. If you want it to help you to read a book, just forget about this one.... I've just purchassed it, and am begging the seller to take it back."
4,"Typical velcro roll, great value","Some of the reviews state that this velcro is relatively thick--while this may be true, it's still very easy to work with. The base fabric is flexible enough to work even in tight rolls. Great price for a good product."
4,GO TO GOTO,"I discovered Walerian Borowczyk's GOTO, ISLAND OF LOVE in the seventies at my high school's film club between an Ingmar Berman and a Stanley Kubrick movie. And since then, I never had the opportunity to see it again. But I've always remembered the strange atmosphere of GOTO with the concerto of Haendel playing on Glossia's tearful face.Cult Epics had the great idea of releasing GOTO on DVD, adding as bonus feature ""Les Astronautes"", a short film directed by Borowczyk and Chris Marker in 1959. I was happy to see that the movie ages well and that my memory hadn't added to it the faked beauty of the souvenirs. So I can't but advise you to discover GOTO and his strange characters whose names are Gono, Gonasta, Grozo, Gurto and even Grymp.A DVD zone lost in time."
1,Bait and Switch,"When you do a ""search"" for Kenny Chesney and this fake cd comes up it's just not right. This is NOT a Kenny Chesney cd! There is a sticker on the front of the case ""Notice to retailers: file with Kenny Chesney."" The producer of this poor quality, high priced so-called ""tribute"" cd is deceitful in his marketing. I'll bet Mr. Chesney does not approve."
2,What's so magic? REVISED VERSION SEE BELOW,"Perhaps I have yet to find the surface on which this product works ""magic"". I have tried shower doors, shower enclosure, toilet bowl water line, white athletic shoes...Haven't found a use for which this works any better than a plain sponge with a general purpose (409 or Fantastik) spray. I will keep trying, there are 7 more sponges in the box... I will amend my review if I find that ""magic"" application of this cleaner.UPDATE:OK so it still doesn't work on my shower doors, but I have found some uses for which it is pretty effective. Window sills, baseboards, scuffs on linoleum, Scotch tape residue on windows, banisters, door frames. I'd revise my rating to a 4 stars at this point."
2,Very disappointed,"This pot is big & beautiful, Only mistake about this pot... Is Buying This Pot. Food burns on the bottom, & everything sticks No matter what soap or oil you use. My big beautiful pot is not worth cooking with Im sad that that pot is such a bad product Because, I'm not rich & I saved up for this pot. I don't have anything good to say about this product:{"
5,Every parent must read this book with their children!,Thank you Jacuqelin McCord for this wake up call. It's so easy to forget what its like to be a child and how things that we consider unimportant are important to children. This story is such a wonderful way of working through the issue of fogiveness for parents who love their children but sometimes fall short of being perfect. I hope that many parents will read this book!
5,He found Rome a city of brick and left it marble,"Jones does a good job of painting a portrait of Augustus from Julius Caesar's death to Augustus's own death. What Jones reveals is that Augustus was a wise ruler who tried to conceal his absolute power by putting on the trappings of a Republic, a man who prevented people from worshipping him while he was alive to prevent resentment from the nobles. Jones also shows how Augustus played a part in the great boom of literature and art during his reign (Livy, Horace, Virgil, and Ovid all lived during Augustus's reign). Although his cautious nature prevented him from being a great military leader like his adoptive father, he nonetheless ended many civil wars that plagued the empire before his arrival."
1,Driving Left of Center toward the breakdown lane.,Ed Shultz is on the right track but does not follow thru with many ideas like the voting machines. Seems to be friendly with beef growers as he sends out steaks on his show and never addresses the serious problem of Mad Cow Disease. The book seems to miss many major points. Definitely not written by an intellectual person or one who deeply understands the issues. Completely misses the point on Colin Powell and his nespotic behavior. Disappointing all in all.
1,Left out some imporant stories,"I thought this book was okay, but it would have been more educational if he would have included some background on his experience with near-death experiences involving Jack Daniel's bottles or actual death experiences involving the slaughtering of hunting dogs."
1,RUSH COPYCAT,"This guy is your basic dime store liberal mouthpiece. I've listened to the radio show a number of times and its 100% rip off of the Limbaugh show. The guy copies Limbaugh's voice, laugh, manerisms, merchandise, etc. What appears to have happened is the guy went to some type of conservative radio convention when he was on that side and tried to kiss up to Limbaugh and was totally ignored. Now he's attempting this ""turn liberal"" stunt to somehow get even in his feeble mind. The book is exactly along the same lines there is nothing new if you've heard the show even a few times. Bottom line: if you want to be on the winning team listen to and read Limbaugh. There is a good reason why the world of Michael Moore and Dan Rather tactics has been a loser for more than 10 years now."
2,If its like his radio show - boring!,"Not quite sure what Mr. Schultz is trying to accomplish with this book. I find it hard to follow his logic of demonizing those he disagrees with. His ""conversion"" from righty to lefty sounds too convenient to this person."
5,"Toughtful, incisive look at America and where we are heading","Ed Schultz has the fastest growing talk-show in America.A former Conservative, he is a gun-toting, beer drinking,Liberal. While you may not agree with him, you shouldfind the book interesting and thought provoking.Worth your time"
4,Pure insanity,"I don't think this is the best Beck album to buy, that would be ""Odelay"", but this does have what is perhaps his best and most demented song to date. That of course is the title track. How does he even come up with these lyrics? They're almost surreal in their randomness. This song makes ""I Am the Walrus"" sound normal by comparison. Beck's really not a great singer, but the way he delivers these lyrics is just flawless. I really can't describe what I'm talking about here. Like, I'm a much better singer, but I could never do it as perfectly as he does. If that doesn't make sense, oh well. It's befitting of a Beck review anyway. :-PBy the way, did you ever notice that that Butthole Surfers song ""Pepper"" sounds exactly like ""Loser"". I for one think that's no coincidence.Anyway, this is a must-buy for those like weird, psychotic music."
4,two versions,"Evidently, there are 2 versions of this single. I bought one way back in the day which has LOSER on it, accompanied by CORVETTE BUMMER and these two other UNBELIEVABLE songs! TOTALLY CONFUSED, a mellow song with (get this) a female back up singer, and one of Beck's greatest songs of all time--MTV MAKES ME WANT TO SMOKE CRACK, where Beck tears it up on the piano. You need to find this version of the single as well, because the songs on this particular version are really cool, but having a Beck collection at your home without MTV MAKES ME WANT TO SMOKE CRACK is like showing up at church naked...it's UNSPEAKABLE!"
3,"Good, but the older one is better....","A decent book for the motivated do-it-yourselfer. I am definitely glad I bought this book, as there were several key things I hadn't considered - like disabling the airbags before working on the electrical system in the console. Pretty easy to read and follow for a non-auto-mechanic.I accidentally bought the 1991-1998 version of this same manual, although I have a 1999 Saturn. Even though the 1991-2002 version of this book covers more model years, it is thinner and has less detail. There are several points where I find myself referring back to the previous book (1991-1998) for pictures or a more detailed description of something."
2,Not enough detail,I bought this book to learn how to fix the horn on my 1999 Saturn. Unfortunately the book doesn't mention horns at all. There just aren't enough details to be able to fix many problems.
4,Still good after all these years,Plews is a great old brand. This pan is not quite as heavy as the one it replaced (that one was 40 yrs old) but still a decent gauge galvanized steel pan that will hold well over 5 qts of oil without spilling. And when you when you are done changing your oil you can put it under your BBQ smoker to catch the ashes. Try that with plastic!
5,My dogs appreciate the finer things ...,"How can you review a pan? It works fine, doesn't leak, and my dogs seem to enjoy drinking from it. It appears to be made of a reasonably sturdy material and I have made a note of the Plews brand for buying more of the same."
1,Not as advertised!,"The container is not 3-1/2 gallons, as it said. It looked too samll, so I used a gallon milk jug and came up short of the 3 gallon mark - which will not work for what I bought it for! To cheap to return, but not usable for me...."
5,Wonderful moisturizer,"I discovered this cream while traveling in Europe and have used it ever since.I'm so glad I've found it on Amazon now since I no longer travel out of the country.It is the smoothest cream and although I don't have highly sensitive skin, I find that it never leaves my skin oily or dry but just smooth and supple. I also like the ""delivery"" of the product. Easy container to use and lightweight for travel. I just don't understand why this product is notsold in the U.S. Even though Nivea is in all the drug stores this product is not.Once you try this moisturizer you'll never use anything else"
2,The peg puller sucks,Just buy a rubber mallet from home hardware for $3 and screw a better hook into it. This one bent and was un-usable after the first 3 pegs.
5,Does what it's supposed to...,"What can I say? One end is a rubber mallet & the other has a little hook for pulling out stakes. The mallet is a pretty standard mallet. The hook is convenient & does help pull out stakes that are stuck. I have used this in both sandy & rocky soil in the Northeast & have not experienced any issues with the mallet breaking or the hook bending. Overall, a good product."
2,So-so,"I have a set of All Clad cookware and I really do think its top notch. The downside to this pan is not having non-stick. If you preheat on low and use ample oil, its fine. The problem occurs when someone pre-heats on medium-high heat, like my husband so often does. The pan discolors and to clean it you must boil vinegar water in it for several minutes. It was a little too much work for me --I prefer the non-stick. ~ Mary"
5,"Arguably, Stevie's Best Album-Album ....",".... as opposed to all the compilations. Recorded in '78, this one has very little filler. Just great pop songs, interspersed with the occasional odd bit (""a bat in my fan"" ... a spaghetti commercial Stevie recorded when he was seven ...). Great sound, too, no up-and-down recording quality. He really worked on this one, you can tell. I've had this for like seventeen years and I never sicken of it.Be gettin' it."
1,kimono microthin condoms w/ aqua lube,"I ordered a 100 pack of regular kimono microthin condoms and I got 100 kimono microthin condoms with ""aqua lube."" It wouldve been a hassle to return them even if they wouldve exchanged them, I like the regular kimono microthin condoms but the aqua lube is not desirable."
3,"Cute patterns, but not as unique as I had hoped for...","When I saw that this book was coming out, I knew that I would have to get it. I love the unique patterns on Jenny Hart's website- they're fun and edgier than the usual flower basket patterns you find at craft stores. That's why I was suprised when I flipped through this book for the first time. The iron-on patterns are sweet (baby bottles and cherries), but so simple that I could have drawn them myself. I suggest actually flipping through the patterns in this book before you buy it."
3,"Not exactly what I expected, but...","I admit I bought this book anticipating oodles of yummy embroidery designs by the authoress, akin to the ones she has on her website. I didn't really need the embroidery instructions, which are okay. However, I was disappointed in the number of UNIQUE images; instead, there are less images but they are duplicated in many different sizes (for example, a teacup in several sizes) and none of the designs rival the ones you can buy from her website. I would have liked more flowers and animals, for example. The spiral binding is very nice as is the storage pocket in back; very usable. If you are a beginning embroiderer or just want a book with basic images, this one is fine."
2,Not like her other patterns,"If you're looking for the hip patterns that Jenny Hart is known for through her site, or through her first embroidery kit-- Stitch It, then don't bother with this book. I was disappointed that these are much more run-of-the-mill designs, and don't have the cool retro-y feel that her other patterns have had. The designs here are much more basic and many are bare-bones line drawings with no detail. While there are a TON of them, it just wasn't my cup of tea this time."
3,Designs just OK,I was hoping for more complex patterns in this book. But I found most of the designs very simple and thought that I could have easily drawn them myself. This might be great for beginners or those who want only semi-unique transfers. I found myself regretting spending money on this book only to find not-so-exciting transfers.
3,OK I guess,"This book is everything it says it is and less. Ok it is an ok book. I purchased it for the iron on transfers. First let me say that there are many in the book so I cannot fault them there. I was sadly disappointed though that they were all so outdated. You might as well spend a dollar here and there and buy some of Aunt Martha's iron on transfers. Or better yet, some tracing paper. There isn't anything in this book that you can't doodle yourself. I would say for those just starting out, this would be an excellent sourse of transfers if you like funky little space ships, mariachi dancers and fruit. I did like the martini glasses, lol."
2,Bad illustrations,"The book itself is of good quality in layout and design and the instructions are pretty good too. Overall though, not worth the money because the illustrations are substandard. I think they show a very poor try at getting the wonderful vintage era they are aiming for. Maybe I'm spoiled by a being from a family of visual artists, but honestly, those illustrations just need to be better. I wish I could get hold of the technology to make those transfers."
5,Super Cool,"Love Love Love these kitchy patterns. Love the down to earth writing of Jennifer Hart. Easy to follow, excellent instruction for beginners. Funky, modern design. Brings embroidery into the 21st century. Very cool, very retro."
3,Slightly disappointed,"Overall I was very excited to get this book and I cannot blame my disappointment on the book itself but rather the supplier I got mine from. The bulk of my excitement was for the swallow and the tea cups and pots that I was supposed to get in the book and where the whole reason I chose this book. however I received my book with pages missing including the patterns that purposed my purchase. Wasn't able to leave a review for the seller yet so this is my review for the book. Lots of nice patterns but make sure you get them all. my book was supposed to be ""new"" but I'm not very happy to only get part of what I paid for."
4,sublimely happpy,I got exactly what I needed/wanted from this book for beginners. I finished my first official embroidery project and it was a hit at the wedding!
5,"Untalented, Rejoice!","I am a stitcher and I love it. I saw Jenny Hart on a craft show a few months ago. Intrigued by her hip, interesting patterns and the ease of which she embroidered, I thought, I can do that. And if this untalented, uncoordinated, crafty wanna be can do it, so can you. This book has everything you need to get started. My favorite, favorite part of this book is the iron on practice page so get the stitches down. The iron on transfers are awesome. They are the easiest way to get started and once you do, you won't be able to stop. Jenny Hart makes this easy and as she says, No Your Grannie's Embroidery. You will love this book whether you are a stitcher or not. The transfers alone make it worth your while and before you know it, you'll be embroidering everything in sight."
4,Awesome!,This how-to-book is perfect for the embroidery beginner. The fact there are numerous embroidery patterns makes it a sweet deal.
2,"Cute, not hip","This is not a bad basic book on embroidery, but I don't understand how anyone can call these patterns ""hip."" I'd use the term ""cute"" instead. I was glad I got it from the library first so I could see what the patterns were instead of going from the title. Having seen the book, I'm not going to buy it. The patterns are pretty conventional, not really different from embroidery patterns you can buy elsewhere (except for the one pattern showing an alien in a spaceship, which I did like). In the photos, the needlework is a bit more complex than what you get from the pattern. Photos showing various ways to ""interpret"" the patterns would have been helpful. But if you are just looking for patterns, you'd probably do just as well or better going to your local craft store or purchasing the patterns you want online."
2,"Only patterns, NO How-to","I was very disappointed with this book, I wish I had bought another embroidery book. There are a lot of patterns which are just OK but the how-to part is not very helpful at all, the illustrations are small and not very good. If you like her patterns I recommend going to her website. In my opinion don't get this book."
4,more pictures please!,"This book comes with a lot of great iron on transfers for patterns, but I do wish there were more photographs of ideas of projects. I like the author's writing style and the pittures that are there are really nice, I just would like more!"
3,Sublime design,"I really liked the graphic design of this book, it won me over to purchase. Although on receipt of the book I was a little disapointed with the level of detail within.I am very happy however, to be reminded of the basic embroidery stitches such as stem stich, backstitch, running stitch and satin stitch. The illustrations are really lovely in this section.I was a bit surprised to find that the actual book itself only goes for 48 pages. The rest is of quite simple stitch designs that can be transfered onto your fabric. Good for someone starting out with embroidery, but definately not for the already creatively inspired individual. The design of this book is really lovely though and looks great on my bookshelf."
2,Not as edgy as the 1st book,"The directions are straight forward and easy to follow. The patterns are not as edgy as the previous book or Jenny's individual patterns that are sold on her website. Overall, the layout of the book is superb but I am very disappointed by the pattern selection."
5,great book! great designs!,"this book is just what the title describes, sublime stitching. it has basic instructions (with images to match) on basic stitches, a few helpful hints, and tons of fantastic iron-on patterns.if you're looking for some embroidery ideas and/or inspiration, THIS IS THE BOOK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!!!"
5,The space station was completed!,"Now that the station is done, Jim wanted to be one of the first pilots to go to the moon. Yet when he returns to the station the plan to go to the moon has come to a halt with the rumors, and later news, that the Combine now has a space station of its own.Will mankind ever reach the moon or will they end up in a ""Cold War"" that kills off any dreams of going out into space? Will Jim become a rocket pilot or just end up a soldier in the next war?"
4,Good but not my favorite Wee Sing video,"This video had some nice songs, catchy tunes and seemed to be entertaining for my little sisters but is not my favorite Wee Sing video. I 'd say The Big Rock Candy Mountains is my favorite. I recommend this video if you only have half of the videos in the Wee Sing Series."
3,distracting,"This is a very subjective reaction, but I cannot relax with this cd. It's a pity, because it's very well done. But something about the voice - well I guess the word ""hokey"", as used by another reviewer, expresses it perfectly. She has a very nice deep voice, but it sounds a little like a guy trying to sound like a woman, and it keeps distracting me. Just for your info."
4,Cheap and good,"Really good. Just one note on the 6 Durex Performax: the internal body heat activated climax control lubricant on the inside was jellied instead of liquid, maybe because of the cold, so it needed to be spread with fingers. Anyway I'm really satisfied."
1,"28 is not 48, learn to count.","I received the order today, and was not happy when I counted out 28 condoms instead of the 48 I was expecting and paid for."
3,Incomplete order,I received package today with lack of 2 vibrating ring. I did count complete 48 but 10 of them are non lubricated and 38 were lubricated. do not use non lubricated one other wise you will have unpleasant baby within 9 months and you will be shocked.
1,DO NOT BUY from Green Web Inc,"The product is of inferior quality, not a reliable source. Also 2 Vibrating Rings are missing. Moreover when I called them, the were uncooperative. I am returning the item. Thanks to Amazon return policy. This will be the first time I would be returning an item, not for $15, but companies like Green Web Inc / Condomman.com should not be in business. They are cheap on price because they sell cheap quality goods."
2,No vibrating rings,"I received the 48 condoms but did not receive the vibrating rings. So, don't be surprised if they didn't send you the FREE stuff they (condomman) promised."
1,Not a fan,I'm sure these work for some people. I felt them to be very restrictive & some packages I opened had lumpy pieces of spermicide in them. Never again.
4,Good Printer,This printer has pretty good quality. The speed is not bad. The printer supports duplex print. The design the quality are good.
4,webtv Upgrade Users: It Works!,"MY Canon printer couldn't handle the upgradeAfter seeing what others were using after the after the latest webtv upgrade and what was recommended I chose this modle.It was compatible with my Sony webtv Plus W250 with no other accessories needed. Ink cartriges were included so I could print right away!It spits out a blank page now and then before printing a page. But, I think it is a small if not a correctable thing.I, like many, am just HAPPY TO PRINT AGAIN!"
5,Still tickin',I've owned this printer for many years [2006] and still love it. Thankfully HP still makes ink cartridges for it.Fingers crossed it doesn't give out because I don't think they now make them like they used to.
1,Hp Printer 6122,"I wish I had researched this before I purchased this printer on Aug.4, 2004. Just out ofwarranty after two months this printer is defective. Does the company care? Absolutelynot! My advice to anyone wanting to purchase a printer for their computer is to stay awayfrom HP Printers. Their service is also inferior and they have gone to hell in a basket. Dothey care about satisfying a customer? NO they do not, but then again we the people makeor break a company and in numbers we have power. It is high time that consumers startrealizing that just because HP had a good reputation in the past doesn't mean their qualityor service, holds true today.Sylvia GubermanConnecticut"
1,Decent Printer - LOUSY HP support,"This printer seems to be a decent, reliable, no-nonsense printer. I really like the double-sided print capability. Photo printing isn't bad, but not the best I've seen, and not as good as my HP 960c printer (which was replaced by this printer when it broke after only a few months). The Photo Print software, which is otherwise very useful, has a serious disk space detection bug in it. When I called HP, they ""offshored"" me to India and I was unable to obtain any useful help there. For this HP deserves the lowest possible rating."
1,Beyond Noisey,"The noise put out by this printer is horrendous. It's not the actual printing, but grabbing the paper to feed and then releasing it wakes the neighbors and scares me! It sounds as if all the plastic in the machine is about to break apart. The finished paper (even photo weight) is spit out with such force that it travels a good 6' away across the floor. Don't get me started on the HP support offered - terrible is too kind a word. The quality of print is the same, not better, than my 4 year old 720c. I will NEVER buy another HP product."
1,I can't even give it a star,"This printer broke before I even printed 20 pages on it. HP's online support didn't want to be bothered with telling me what I needed to do, so the printer is already back in its box to be returned. And I'm returning to Epson printers."
4,"If It Hurts, It Isn't Love",Anyone who has had the great fortune to attend at a seminar with Chuck Spezzano knows that the daily principles in this book can be transformational. They are lessons which I try to live by. They are reminders that I have the power to make profound changes in my life and that all changes are my choice. They are lessons to remind me that I am not a victim of circumstance but have the ability to move past my issues and be happier and healthier. This book is essential for me to stay on my spiritual path and I keep it close by. I think Chuck Spezzano is a brilliant man who has searched his own soul and now chooses to share it with us.
1,Not the book I thought it would be,"In reading the title, I thought this would be a great book to help me with those Red Flags we all see in our relationships with our partner, but somehow believe we can over come due to our tremendous power to love. Yes, Virginia, for I to, Love & Do Too Much.When I opened this book, I was shocked to see concepts relating to: when faced with an unbearable action by loved one, go deeper. Show more love, give more! I personally can't give any more, do any more, be any more than I am or ever will be!!I was hoping to see some helpful hints liken to the title (You know, if this hurts you - it isn't love baby). Say, ""he's verbally abused you, yet again, in front of friends or tells you're stupid, worthless, etc."" - I'd think the correct response is A. Walk Away (right Chuck?)I've just ended (for good) a 5 year abusive relationship. I'm glad I did it before I saw this book.Chuck, Change the title - what a misnomer!"
3,"Great, if you're otherwise engaged in a relationship....","but not so good, for a single person, trying to work through issues related to personal growth, reaching out, and the perils of being single in today's over-stressed world. I was touched by Dr. Spezzono's spiritually, even as a non-church-going person. His writing is descriptive, meditative and easy to comprehend, even for those not currently involved in a relationship. Every married couple should give this book a try."
1,crap,ok . this gun is pretty bad. it broke on the first day ...possibly the worst 30 bucks i ever spent
5,Wonderful book! a must have!,"I find this book not only a very fascinating guide to London but also informative!!! A friend of mine who has been to London many times suggested I get this book and Frommel's guide to London. I am so glad I took her advice. I know nothing about London and this book tells you everything! It tells you where to eat, what to see, and what to do! It has beautiful photography of some of the prettiest places in London and I think most beautiful sites in the world! Good purchase! Highly recommend to folks traveling to London. Can't wait to get there!"
5,DK Travel Guides - the BEST!!!!!,I bought my first DK Travel Guide for a trip to Rome - and it proved to be the most useful travel guide that I've ever purchased. Don't even bother with searching for something else - none can compare. No matter where you are traveling - pack a DK Travel Guide for the trip. You won't be disappointed.
5,A good guide that works on iPad,"We have visited London for a few days before going to Paris, southern France and Greece. This is my first time in London and I wanted to have a good travel guide. I ended up purchasing this guide and I used it frequently in London. The guide has maps and good suggestions on where to go and what to see. We h.ave visited a few museums and walked a lot. The guide itinerary is very useful. If you are traveling with an iPad this a good guide to get."
3,A good product hampered by substandard quality control.,"If you intend to solely use this book to prepare for the VB5 exam, DON'T. Since the book assumes that you have prior know how of the VB and it's underlying technologies, I suggest that you use this book together with the VB help and Online Book. One thing I like is the way the book was organized. The topics were divided just as it was stated in the MS website. The accompanying CD was a big let down. The more I take the practice exam, the less it makes me feel of my chances. I never scored beyond 800. There was a lot of mistakes in the practice exam. What you can do is either double check all your answers that was marked as incorrect or use a different practice test like the one from Trancenders.To summarize, the book will provide you with enough information for your review as long as you use it with the product itself together with the VB help and the Online book."
3,"Pretty good, but watch out for the errors","I read this book cover to cover and found that it only provided me with 80% of what I need to know for the exam. The chapters on ActiveX technology were poorly written. The other chapters were better. I guess having multiple authors will lead to the inconsistency. These guys should have proof read each other's work. The test CD was soooooo disappointing. Some test questions were poorly worded and about 20% of the answers were incorrect. i'm sure that you'll be frustrated when you work with the practice test. Don't forget to download the errata.txt file. My final advice is to supplement this book with something else. Aside from the CD, it's still a decent book with good information. However, you need other references to fill the gap. I was able to use the Mastering VB5 CD from Microsoft and the VB Online Help file. Well, the good news is that i was able to pass the exam this morning with a score of 915. Good luck to you!"
4,Easy to learn,It is a good book to passing the exam and i feel good by taking this book and i am looking for other books from new riders
3,"Good content, qute a few source code typeo's","I bought this book to both learn VB and to prepare for the MSCD test, it has rich content and provides enough information to take you to the professional level of VB programming. My only complaint is the number of small bugs in the sample source code, some of it simply doesn't work at all. The provided CD also failed to install properly on either of the two systems I tried. Overall, It's not perfect, but it's probably the best book of it's kind."
2,Not worth it!,"This book seems to skim the surface of subjects, which may be fine if that's what you want. But, if you want to really learn the material there are better references. I feel very strongly that if I had relied on this book for the Microsoft exam, I would have failed!"
4,One Of The Better New Riders Efforts,"While there are certainly proofing errors to be found in this text, it is technically very sound and well organized. It covers exam points quite well, and could even server as an intermediate teaching tool. After the recent disasterous production job New Riders did on their Access MCSD text, it's good to see them getting their editing and proofing act more together. The end of the chapter questions are also quite reasonable, however, the included testing engine software that they are so proud of is a waste of time and money."
1,Not a good value,"No proof-reading was done on this text and it's glaring errors are numerous. Beginning on the inside front cover, I counted six obvious errors before I slogged through to Chapter 2, where another error was found in the first paragraph. I'll not be purchasing any other books from this publisher without a careful preview."
4,Great Content and Practice Quiz,The Practice exercises were great and the presentation of the text was very good. The text cover everything I needed for the exam
3,Better than other titles?,Hopefully this book has had better technical editing than the ACCESS book by the same publisher!!!!!
5,Great Gift,My husband loves this pan and his only request is that we get more like it in the future. I am very happy with this purchase.
5,My wife loves it ...,"and that's all that counts! That, and the item appears very durable, with lifetime warranty."
3,Cute,I bought this to go along with the other Sesame Street Giggle and Go toys. It is cute because Elmo talks as he is pushed.
3,NOTE: NOT an AeroVantage wiper blade!,"The product I just received from Amazon today is the more basic/generic ANCO wiper blade (31-series; same as available locally at walmart for less $). Don't buy this product expecting an AeroVantage blade, which is a premium model; you likely won't get it. I should have verified the ANCO part number before purchase. The cheap wiper blade is model 31-28, whereas an AeroVantage blade is 91-28. The listing title needs to be fixed.That said, I've used these cheaper ones in the past, and they're decent. Haven't had problems with them, and they've been at least as good as any other cheap wiper blade.Another odd note: I ordered several of these, and each came in its own shipping box. I don't know why they couldn't have been packed together, but they weren't."
2,good blade but does not fit Nissan Quest,"I ordered this for my 2004 Nissan Quest. The online fitting filter said this would fit, but in fact it it is a tiny bit too long as the 28 inch driver-side wiper clips the 18 inch passenger-side wiper during use. I should have ordered a 26 inch driver side, and in fact the online fitting filter on another web site I just saw will advise you to get a 26 inch wiper.Update: I kept the 28 inch wiper in place, and used a spare 17inch wiper I had handy to replace the 18inch passenger side wiper. This works, although the 28inch one still seems a little too long as it grazes the bottom of the window down onto the black rubber border."
3,Decent book on Kung Fu,[...]I ordered this book more out of curiosity than anything else. While it was informative I found that a lot of things I had hoped to learn were not in the book.That being said it is still an excellent book that gives great information to any martial art't enthusiast looking to learn about Shaolin Kung Fu.
3,Christian - yes. Jazz - no!,"The DVD in this 2 disc set explains the music and from a Christian perspective the presentation is good enough. The ""jazz"" element for me is missing here. To me jazz = improvisation, there is little musical improv here. What's up with that?"
2,Too many mistakes to take more seriously.,"There is simply too much fluff and too many errors for me to take this book seriously. I fell for a good review off another site of this book and while I admit it isn't generic and easy (Priceton Review) or long-winded and overly difficult (Kaplan), I found simple errors like another reviewer all over the place!I even e-mailed the editors about these errors, and they said they would correct them in the new edition, but it looks like I was wasting my time. They're simply not doing their jobs because I felt like I was reading a pre-proofread book. Horrendous.It's okay for review if you KNOW these concepts already, but if you are learning some new things, there is no way to tell what is correct and what is not. (If you know everything, play a game with how many mistakes you can find. Have fun.)Also: I did fine on the test. Over 700, but that is because I like chem a lot and am taking ap chem right now. While this book may have helped a bit, it was excruciating."
2,"If you are in a time crunch, AVOID THIS BOOK","This book does have some useful information, but it wastes your time. In chapter 1, for example, after discussing mass and density, they have a brilliant little ""Think about this:"" section that says, ""Think about this: If you had 1,000 grams of feathers and 1,000 grams of the metal lead, which one would you use to fill your pillow? Even with both samples having the same mass, it is hard to imagine having much fun at a pillow fight if the pillow were filled with lead!"" Don't forget, readers, this is on the first page of chapter 1. I suffered through 13 chapters, 187 pages SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO!! This book is NOT your friend when you're short on time."
2,Full of ERRORS and not the most helpful,"After going through the majority of the book, I knew that it was not the best book. There were many errors and misleading information. I bought it because of the good reviews on the Amazon, but I soon realized that many of them were just used to bring up the ratings. I would not recommend this book. If you are actually serious of the SAT chem, do not buy McGraw's book!"
5,Muy Bien book,This book provides an excellent resource when preparing for an exam or quiz while studying chemistry. Before I encountered this book my grades where horendus. Now they are well lets just say much much better. Thank you Mr.Evangelist for writing a easy to understand book.Can i get E.C.
4,nostalgia has never been so fun,"Kaminsky gives us a shot at looking at our parent's generation through modern eyes, and its damned fun. I look forward to his other series; Rostnikof and Lieberman; I'm sure they will be quite entertaining."
3,A single of one of White Zombie's greatest songs,The Single of White Zombie's hit track Thunderkiss65. Its just a cool song that sooner or later would be placed onto a single ..
3,Good Start,I am a former Army intelligence officer and I think that this was a good first cut at the topic. I was enrolled in a Homeland Security class that used this text. We studied the system and response of DHS and then the following week Katrina hit followed by Rita. What should have happened and what actually happened leave much to be fixed. The description of terrorism was so lacking that the instructor allowed me to teach the class. The information on chemical and biological agents looked like it came out of a Hazmat class manual. To be a better book it needs to be updated and revised. FEMA has free online classes which the authors should consider in their update. This book was great as no other book attempted to put together the area of homeland security under the new DHS.
5,A Great Piece History!,"As a man still in his 50's, I often wished I had more historic momentos of other great men, like Martin L. King, Jr and John F. Kennedy. This dvd is a great piece of history that I can share with my grandchildren. Barack Obama will go down in history as the first African American President and I'm glad I have this dvd to relive such a monumental time in history"
2,Not much substance,"This was worth watching, for Michelle Obama and Barack Obama's speeches at the end, but most of the movie is just rhetoric from other people talking about how great Obama is. It doesn't shine very much light onto the audience about who he is behind the regular campaign hype.There's gotta be much better documentaries out there about Obama that are more informative about who he is off-stage."
5,Beautiful valentine's day gift/ gift to a loved one,"This is a compilation of poems, classic excerpts from plays and stories, words from popular songs, sweet tasting recipes, love letters, short-short stories, and illustrations that focus on love as a theme. The poets, storytellers, and playwrights represent a who's who of English literature to include Shakespeare (his sonnets), Twain, Joyce, Dumas, and Angelou among other notables. The love letters include Churchill, Napoleon, Darwin (an extract from his famous Journal), and Kafka, etc. The songs are older classics.The collection is fun, well designed, and can be leisurely read in no particular order as desired by the reader. Cupid struck pay dirt with this wonderful collection that will brighten up anyone's day. THE LITTLE BIG BOOK OF LOVE makes a wonderful unique Valentine's Day present that will not lie on a coffee table, as the recipient will relish the wide variety of tributes to the power of love.Harriet Klausner"
5,Great film--and great book,"This documentary is so moving--insight into horses and to the man who has such an amazing sensitivity to these wonderful animals. As others have noted, his rough childhood plays an important role in his empathy for a fellow creature that has been abused by horse ""breaking"" techniques. The movie is so much more too--offering insights into how the horses' problems reflect issues of the owners, yet in a way that is inspiring and hopeful for both the horses and their owners. Even for people who have no particular interest in horses, this is a beautiful and sensitive tale. Plus, the gorgeous footage of horses and ""cowboy"" country is entrancing. I became a fan of this quiet-spoken man after seeing the film and bought his book,The Faraway Horses: The Adventures and Wisdom of One of America's Most Renowned Horsemen. Highly recommended too!"
4,"Buck, a real horse whisperer","Buck is a real person who ""helps horses with people problems."" By helping owners respect their horses, Buck shows owners how to improve their own lives. The movie goes into, but doesn't dwell on Buck's traumatic childhood, and shows us we can choose how we react to our past: we can repeat it or not. Buck earns an animal's respect, by understanding it, and guides horses thru gentle persuasion instead of intimidation. If everyone treated the world with the same respect Buck treats his world, we'd live in a much better place. I bought the movie from Amazon, so I could watch it whenever I wanted to be reminded how a gentle man overcame his own past to help others do the same. I also liked seeing how he magically worked with animals and people, and how quickly he earned their respect."
5,Excellent and needed,"An Important documentary for anyone who love handle horses, Buck has changed my views about horses, trainers and myself. One of the best documentaries-movie I have ever seen."
4,The power of positive thinking....,Many of us seek to change our present behaviors and attitudes that we know are the result of the very difficult environment we grew up in but few find the strength courage and insight to accomplish the task.
4,Buck,"Buck is a documentary of Buck Brannaman, a horseman who overcame a wretched childhood in which he and his brother were beaten by their father. The beatings came to encourage them to learn their rope tricks better and for less understandable reasons. Buck has overcome the challenges in his childhood and has become, in this documentary, a man with a simple truth; that if we are patient and sympathetic, we can get both horses and people to listen and understand. Whether you are a horsman yourself or not if you value the truth, well told, you will find this film a rewarding experience.Buck"
5,Buck,one of the best movies i have seen in years and i recommend it to everyone. whether they are a animallover or not.
4,very good,"A very good movie about the man and his story that was in one of my favorite movies, The Horse Whisperer."
4,Buck is a great horseman!,"I bought this movie because I thought it would be more of a horse training video, but it turned out to be more about Buck's life history. It was very interesting and I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though it wasn't exactly what I expected. It is more like a documentary than a movie. Even though Buck experienced hardships and abuse as a child, he grew up to be a very responsible, loving, caring adult. He used his experiences to help others - people as well as horses. If you love horses, you'll love this movie."
5,Buck,"this is a wonderful,informative film for any horseman or horsewoman. If you handle and or work around horses, you will benefit from seeing this film."
4,Great story.,"I,m thinking of the part where someone says, ""only someone with a tortured mind could understand horses like Buck does"" or something close to that."
4,A great video,"A friend who loves horses recommendedBuck, or I might never have found it. It is amazing to watch Buck work with horses, but this is a great personal interest story as well. Buck overcame the odds to become an amazing man, and I found the story to be inspirational. The movie is entertaining to watch, but there are many life lessons included in his story as well. There is also a short segment about his work with Robert Redford (including an interview with Redford) on the movie The Horse Whisperer. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes animals or biographies or stories about overcomers."
5,Amazing Documentary Even for a Non-Horse-Person,"I'm not a horse enthusiast, but I am an avid student of human psychology and behavior, and I can tell that Buck Brannaman is a master. Buck was amazing to watch -- he can get a horse to behave in about 20 minutes, and to respond to signals so subtle, you can hardly tell he was doing anything. He understands that a horse's behavior, good or bad, is the direct result of the owner's treatment, so he counsels the human beings while he's training their horses. And his style is so down-to-earth and matter-of-fact that they can't help but listen.I'm utterly inspired by how peaceful he is in his approach toward horses as well as other people. He deeply understands that anger and criticism instills fear rather than discipline, and he applies this understanding in his calm approach to even the most difficult horse (and owner). This is a guy who was terribly abused by his father, who turned around and used his sensitivity in his work."
5,Wonderful movie!,"This movie was enjoyed by both ""horsey"" and ""non-horsey"" members of my family. It's the little movie nobody heard of that really sticks with you once you see it! I'd love to see one of his clinics in person!"
5,the best,"When I saw this documentary I was amazed. Buck Brannaman is an encreadible horseman. His whole life story really moved me, and I'm very impressed that he was able to turn his life around and make it a good one. I wish all the best to Buck Brannaman and his family!"
4,What a beautiful film.,This film left me wanting more. Buck Brannaman has such an honest philosophy in the treatment and training of horses.
5,This is a great movie.,Buck Brannaman is an amazing horseman and you can learn a few life lessons from him too! I recommend this film.
5,Movie,A documentary for all horse lovers!! I wish I knew this man in person... He is an angel in deed!!
5,Wonderful documentary!!,You can't miss this one. Fantastic documentary. Very interesting subject matter. Heart warming and educational. I loved every bit of this DVD!
5,Excellent movie,This movie is excellent and has relevance to non horse people. His book on his life is an execellent follow up
5,The Man,"Buck the Movie is great he is a great man, the story of his life is somthing to see I have seen it 4 times loved it everytime worth a look"
5,a whole universe,"This beautiful very touchy..AwesomeThis film of a person that actually presents to you/us :horses, persons, people with horses, your personality reflected and radiated back to you from the horse you own.The father daughter relation Buck and his daughter makes it personal to me , family bonds ,feels like home.It is not a film it is a Universe ,it is one of the things that makes our world beautiful my utmost respect to Buck"
4,Not Astonishing but...,"A lot of times instead of helping people with horse problem, I help horses with people problem... Well, Buck certainly got that one right. For an individual whose dad calls up on him to help him out by shooting his pet right between the eyes and then having Buck to clean it up so they can have a meal together, what Buck has achieved in humanity is not astonishing, it is a miracle. The criminal system may learn a thing or two from Buck. Double Bravo."
2,snoozer,"Fell asleep and awoke to what I suppose was the climax, which wasn't all that impressive. Horses...eh, I can take 'em or leave 'em, so if you're a big horse fan you'll like it more than I did, that's for sure"
4,buck,It's hard to imagine any horse person not liking this film. I found it very interesting. I wanted it to last longer.
5,Satisfied w/service.,This item arrived on time and in perfect condition (as far as I know - I gave it as a gift).
3,For Horse Lovers,Filmed and presented in a documentary style this movie shows how a man who experienced some rough spots in his own life used those experiences to make a special connection with most horses. This is definitely a movie for horse lovers...especially those who may become involved in training horses and/or those who have love and compassion for those magnificent animals.
4,Powerful and moving,"This is an intimate story of Buck Brannaman's life and his life's work, helping people deal with their horses in a humane and effective way, and often having a look at their lives too. I love his droll sense of humour and laid back cowboy style, which conceals a depth of understanding and empathy for the horses and his clients. Some spectacular shots which couldn't have been planned make for disturbing but effective veiwing. Small glitch in continuity - watch out for him ""shoeing"" a barefoot horse!"
5,Love this film!,"I wish everyone would watch this film! Buck has a unique way of getting the point across to people that it's not always the animal that has the problem, More often than not it's the person who needs to look deep and fix things. I wish more people would realize this and act on it. There was so many good points in this film it's hard to quote them all. I hope that whoever watches this will make those changes and appreciate what Buck has to say and really listen."
5,Buck; Worth the bucks I spent,"This was a wonderful video. I think we could all learn something from this man about how we should treat God's creatures, great and small."
3,Buck DVD from USA does not work on European DVD players,"Buck is a good documentary & enjoyable to watch & informative for horse owners & riders. Unfortunately the Dvd is not compatabile with European DVD players and we had to hook up speakers to my laptop & watch it on it. As I had bought it for family viewing on our TV set, it was disappointing & I would be very wary of buying DVD's from USA again."
5,Buck's Book #1,"What a great book. After starting it, I couldn't put it down. It has helped me with working with my horse and I'm sure my horse appreciates my approach as well. I'm starting the second book now."
2,not what I was expecting,It seemed very slow and I didn't even finish it the first time I sat down. I think it could of been made better.
3,Wow - I must have missed something,"The video Buck is a slow paced family video made for horse people. I am not one. The story was simple and had about 5 repetitive ""action/tricks"" that Buck used to train others on how to ""break"" there colts. He is surely a great and genital man that suffered through some very bad times during his childhood. But I was more interested in him than the horses. Why did he choose to stay away from his wife, did his childhood make him the loner he spoke of? The reason he gave for not spending more time with his wife and dauther was very weak. What about his brother, what happened to his father? This video did give some good simple lessons for dealing with people and horses and he believes they are the same. Sorry, this was a nice feel good movie however it failed to meet the mark for me."
1,Too Slow for Me,"I bought it for the rave reviews. I guess I'm just not into horses enough (despite the fact I am a farmer) to listen to the lengthy and slowly delivered points about training a horse. I thought it might have a bit more of a story line, but it was just a very matter-of-fact 90 minute long discussion about equine training."
5,One of the best documentary's ever.,"Buck is not just a movie for horse lovers. It is a movie for human beings. The cinematography is amazing. The music is beautiful, Eddie Vedder's Just Breath is perfect in this movie, and Buck himself is brilliant."
4,Interesting movie,It was good for telling his story and the reasoning behind his approach to working with the horses. Good quality video.
3,Not what I was expecting,"I heard this movie was amazing by several ""horse"" friends and decided I had to check it out. I was looking to see more of how he brought horses along not only little snippets of workshops. The movie is more about his life and while not a bad movie, it wasn't what I was looking for."
5,An amazing documentary....,"If you are looking for a healing, BUCK is the film to watch. Buck Brannaman was the inspiration for the wonderful film, The Horse Whisperer, by Robert Redford. Buck was a victim of severe child abuse, and was also a child prodigy with rope tricks. As a healing, he went on to work with horses, to help train them with loving kindness and firm discipline.This film is beautifully filmed, sensitively depicted and full of life wisdom. Our hero is soft spoken, strong and amazingly resilient. A real inspiration of a human being. A beauty of a film."
4,This book is a must-have for lovers of Chicago blues.,"Toose has created a vivid and compelling read with her ""Muddy Waters: Mojo Man."" It is thorough, descriptive, and lively. A must as a reference. My biggest complaint is the avoidable romanticizing of the book's blues heroes. Robert Johnson's clutching his guitar in death, and threadbare editorializing of life in the Delta, working for exploitive white owners are a little much. And there are some inaccuracies. At one point Toose decribes Muddy's first electric solidbody guitar as a Les Paul Custom, new in 1954. This was indeed the first year of the Custom, but Jimmy Rogers, a sentence or two later decribes the ""gold front"" of the guitar. His description and the book's accompanying photos clearly show a Les Paul Standard, new in 1952.Minor quibbling aside, I very much enjoyed the book and will recommend it to my blues friends. Muddy was the Godfather of all modern-day blues men and women and this is a welcome book to any blues library."
2,An Impressionistic Portrait,"Tooze's new biography is most useful for its ample use of primary accounts from Waters and those close to him. The book works best as a loving tribute to some of the most influential music of the twentieth century. Yet a facile prose style and a lack of contextualization make this a frustratingly one-dimensional biography. One finishes with only an impressionistic sense of this singularly important individual. Tooze pays virtually no attention to the women in Waters' life, and misinforms the reader by repeating apocryphal tall-tales. Mojo Man is a poorly written and shallow portrait of a mighty and deep historical figure."
5,"What, I can only give 5 stars?","Giving this product only 5 stars is an insult. The empeg / RioCar is such an innovative ground-breaking product that it has taken the rest of the world 10 years to catch up. If you have an extensive music collection, and have some skill with computers, then you must have an empeg. It gives control over your music collection like nothing else, it has an impressive broad range of features, and you'll always look down and smile at the amazing real time visualizations which move to the music. It may be 10 years old, but the community of users still support the player and develop new functionality for it. To find one new in the box after all these years is rare, so give this purchase some consideration. Enjoy."
5,The best there is,If you have ever spent the summer in Japan and had their green tea shaved ice this is what you had. They serve up shaved green tea ice in a big bowl and it is the cats meow. You can find it cheaper in some of the Asian stores. Buy it durning the winter as it us usually on sale and then enjoy it on a hot summer evening. Mix it up and freeze it until it is almost hard and throw it in the blender to make a slush. Pure enjoyment
2,Doesn't taste like real green tea,"I decided to try this green tea after reading the reviews and I got disappointed. This green tea tastes nothing like the real green I have gotten in Japan, nor it tastes anything like Starbucks Frappuccino. I love a good deal but this one is a case of ""you get what you pay for""."
3,Wayy too sweet,It def tastes very similar to starbucks green tea latte / frappiebut it's just WAYYYYYYYY too sweeet... I think more than half of it is just sugar...
3,Sugar added,"I apparently did not read the add thoroughly enough. They have added sugar to this matcha which makes is basically useless for traditional tea ceremony and the sugar is not very healthy. It tastes ok, so for someone just wanting some matcha ice cream or a dessert, its ok."
2,sweetness!,This stuff does taste kinda like starbucks. But with all the sugar I did'nt really enjoy it. Buy this if your running low on sugar and don't like green tea.
3,LaChaise Folding Recliner,"We are pleased with the recliner comfort except we did not realize there is no separate foot adjustment. I like to sit more upright with feet up to read. Also, the instructions says that ""Once in the desired recline position, turn the red lock knobs until the chair locks in place."" Our chairs do not have red knobs but ""latches"" that do not totally lock no matter what position we put them in."
5,Excellent music,"Although I believe that this is a great CD, the music is excellent and the concert was for a good cause, I think that the price is excessive. It would be just to pay for the booklet because there are other sources to obtain the music at a fair price."
3,Decent,"The content is basically good, but some of the scenarios are stereotypical, and questions can be repetitive. I'm just lukewarm on this book and workbook. Stimulates some decent discussion, but a lot of times, our group finds ourselves saying, ""Let's skip that question because we already answered it previously."""
5,Great Book,This workbook is an awesome mate to the Love and Respect Book. My spouse and I took this workshop at our church and it did wonders. Purchasing the book and workbook kept the program fresh in our minds and held us accountable.A MARRIAGE MUST HAVE!!!
2,2 Stars is generous,"I was excited to read this book( till about the 8th page). We used it for a study in a couples small group from my church. Immediately there were questions toward Dr Eggerich ... like does he have women issues?( bitterness,lack of understanding) His focus is that the women is the main problem of every marriage.I am terriably dissapointed in this book, and I am as far from being a feminist as you could be, this book is very disrepectful towards women. Not only that it is poorly written he spends chapter after chapter repeating himself and never getting to the point. Love & respect are always part of every marriage, but they are not the only issues involved. The bad in this book outweighs the good. I think Dr Eggert should read The Five Love Languages and work on his communication skills. I beleive God's plan has a better balance for husband & wife than Eggerich's book offers."
2,Did meet my expectations,"I got this workbook thinking it would go well with the CD series that I also purchased. I love the CD series, but the workbook (to me) did not collate very well with the series. So I never used it."
3,Good workbook,"I liked the workbook, but not as much as the book that it goes with. I found the book itself to be more of a resource than the workbook, but I would probably still recommend both of them. The workbook was still in great shape when it was sent and it arrived on time, so that was great regardless."
3,Good -leisurely- introduction on Luhmann,"We live in a functionally differentiated society. The mass media, the economy, politics, etc are all separate complex, self organizing and self-reproducing systems.To each system the others are just the environment, they influence the system, but not in any direct, simply input-output related way. The systems has it's own rules / ways of digesting the input and creating things from it that make sense to it.Just like a living organism takes it's food and energy from the environment, and creates Picasso's with it. Who could have guessed such a relation between input (potatoes) and output?Anyway, this view goes a long way in making clear why politics so often seems to come to nothing, or why the economy takes its own fearful course.The book is not very factual however, if you want to know more about the abstract theory of complex adaptive systems. Or want to know how exactly (e.g.) the mass media is an example of such a system."
4,Check the details!,"I ordered this pan for my induction cooktop, from the description that it has a ""stainless interior"". Turns out, MC2 is NOT induction compatible. So back this goes... Don't make the same mistake that I did. I can't give the pan a bad rating; I'm sure it works fine for its intended use..."
4,"Very even cooking, non-stick simply average","The lure of All-Clad is the very even heating, and this pan delivers that all around and even up the sides. Non-stick service is average in my experience but very durable. My fiance's smaller hands have a somewhat harder time gripping the handle under weight, but I find it very easy to manipulate."
5,All-Clad Master Chef 2 Non-stick 12 inch Pan,Pan is great. Good thick non-stick surface that appears very durable. Nice finish and construction.
5,the cook,"I investigated all available brands of this type/size pan, regardless of price. The All Clad I selected has met all requirements beautifully."
3,Warranty problems,"I have a full collection of All Clad pans, and recently returned the 8"" nonstick pan as it sticks terribly even with quite a bit of oil. Mostly used as an egg pan, always hand washed and never in the dishwasher but has been around for years. I returned this pan under lifetime warranty over two months ago and still it has not been replaced. I have called and emailed, and still am not sure if it has even been sent out to me. I was asked for the USPS confirmation number for the return, thank goodness I paid extra at the post office for this and have saved it. That was weeks ago, making me thinkthey had lost my return. Called again today as still no pan, and got no information when it is coming but the promise to call back about it. Don't know that I would spend almost $100 again for an egg pan with this kind of service. I would expect better service from All Clad than this."
1,Poor warranty,"I have had several non stick all clad pans. Over the years, I have returned them under warranty. It takes them 6-8 weeks to evaluate your pan for any returns. The most recent pan I returned as it was sticking terribly was in November. Four months later, I still do not have a replacement, and am getting no where with customer service. Be sure you get a confirmed delivery as well, they said they did not receive my pan at all until I provided the USPS delivery confirmation that I paid for in addition to sending the pan back. They agree the pan should be replaced under warranty. But four months later, still no pan. Do yourself a favor, save your money and get something else in the non stick pan class. The warranty is almost useless at this point, and after a few years, even with no dishwasher, wooden utensils and care, they will stick."
5,the ultimate pan,"All-Clad Master Chef 2 Nonstick8-Inch FRy Pan----hey you hestitant chefs, go for it! Do you want to flip an over easy egg? This is the pan for you..."
2,Inside peeling off,"I bought this pan over a year ago and I put it in the dishwasher. Don't do that! That is the only explanation I can come up with as to why the interior is peeling off. A $100 pan should last a lifetime as it is said to do, but I voided my warranty, I guess. I would buy cheap ones that don't hurt me so much to throw away. Normally I buy stainless steel All clad which are exellent and approved for dishwasher."
5,Bratz,I don't like the fact that some mothers are judging Bratz as a bad toy for their daughter. They just take one look at the dolls and say:Sorry! You're not allowed to buy her!
1,Moms please don't purchase this doll!!!!!!,"I love the bratz dolls however this one was over the top. My daughter recieved this doll as a birthday present and I was angry when I noticed the doll had on a black sheer thong!! No underwear or diaper, but a sheer thong. I could not believe it. I really dont think this is a good message!"
3,Beck - Where its at,"This single shows an impressive use of counter culture. Beginning with an already whacked out song, Beck steps up to a new plataeu with this single."
4,Lots of valuable info...,"I used a number of books over the years but have always found this book to have the most info in one place. The milage is put in a great to follow format. There is town info, postal info, and some comments from past hikers. I feelit is worth the wait for an informative book."
5,Indispensable,"This guide provides a mile by mile tour of the AT provides info regarding water availability/shelters/scenic areas, I have read it cover to cover three times, picking up new info each time. I am waiting for the new planning guide to be published this year so I can plan my thru-hike.Haru"
1,Not Updated Thoroughly,I can not recommend this book. I found this guide is not updated as thoroughly on a yearly basis as some of the other A.T. guides.
1,Outdated and incomplete,"Information is very outdated. Doesn't seem to know about any trail changes made in the last four years. Only seems to list half of the services in most towns, and quite often lists things that have been closed for years. Author claims seven thru-hikes, but they must have been many, many years ago. Basically worthless, no thru-hikers on the Trail ever use it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money..............,"This was probably the worst of all of the AT guide books out there. The information was not very thought out at all. I was also personally banned from the author's web page (...) for the mere fact that I am a republican and supported the president and our troops overseas. I couldn't believe it. He told me that supporters of the president were not welcome unless I could ""keep my mouth shut."" Despite any personal biases I have towards him, I objectively claim that ANY other books out there regarding the AT are going to be more useful."
1,Romantic Drivel,"For anyone who is interested in Celtic myth and legend, the Matthews may seem like a perfectly good starting point. The only problem is that, as the first review of this book says, it only helps to reinforce Romantic fantasies of what the Celts were like. Caitlain Matthews is especially known for this by academics as she makes two big mistakes over and over again: a.) she assumes that all Celtic cultures are the same and b.) she makes no differentiations between different time periods. This book is no different and does not help to further true academic studies of Celtic literature."
1,Not Good!,"I was very disappointed by this book. I did not care about the narrator's on-line or ""real"" life, nor her clothes, her dimensionless friends or her very boring fantasies. The ""sex"" scenes are juiceless and the show-don't-tell writing rule is blatantly disregarded. I was mildly interested in the ending though, as I skipped several chapters to get to it, so I guess Baer accomplished something."
1,Disappointing!,"This book did not live up to my expectations. The characters were flat and shallow. While we were given insight to the ""positive"" affects of Elaine's foray into computer sex; we weren't told why she started in the first place, or anything about who she is inside. I found the book boring."
1,Total Waste of Time!!!,"I thought this book sounded interesting. Unfortunately, Ms. Baer took a good idea and ruined it. The charactors were not believable, the main charactor was a self obsessed bore. The plot was ridiculous, no people are motivated to further their carrers simply by online sex. I kept reading in hopes that it would get better or become more interesting, only to be dissapointed.Bottom line: As Francesca is imposible to relate to and a complete waste of time and money."
2,A bloody bore,"I didn't like the characters in this book -- I found them shallow and self-absorbed and, by extension, boring. Actually, it read more like a long, heavily-researched magazine article. I wasn't surprised to learn that the author used to write for Wired Magazine, a (very good) publication that caters to geeks. Nuff said."
2,"Drivel...........And, it's neverending.","This book was a gift. Thank God, I didn't spend money on it. It's was awful. I don't see the point. Still, to this day I wonder, WHY?Don't waste your time or money. NOT WORTH IT!"
5,Erotic with an engaging plot and well developed characters,_As Francesca_ tells an intriguing story of one woman's adventure to find the ultimate sexual encounter. This novel is unusual in that it is simultaneously erotic and plot-driven. The characters are interesting and original. I recommend this book to anyone who has an open mind about sex or wishes they did.
2,More Purple than Prince,"Distracting, overwritten prose spoils any erotic tension the story could have projected. Too much literary pretension, not enough stimulation. Sounds like it was written by a Creative Writing major- it tries too hard."
1,"Promising concept, but predictable and less than involving","The book contained a promising concept, incorporating cyberia within the folds of the erotic thriller. But it was just plain boring. It was very easy to predict exactly what would happen next and who Elaine would next suspect to be the secret Inez... The story follows a rigid day-night-day-night formula which is too repetitive to be interesting. Character development is really shallow; I never got drawn into Elaine or any of her friends. Pretty disappointing read."
3,"Pretty, but small","I purchased this to wear for a wedding, but the silver outshined the stones, which seems to disappear. I returned this item."
1,At Least It's for a Good Cause,"Well, here's your chance to show your level of political commitment. About the only good thing I can say about this collection is 50% of the proceeds from the wholesale price will benefit ACLU's lesbian/gay rights and AIDS projects. Rather than showcase the wide variety of gay & lesbian talent out there, they have filled this CD (two disc's worth) with maudlin folksie ballads (disc one) and novelty songs (disc two). The only artist with whom I was familiar was RuPaul, and even his contribution was bland. It's a shame ACLU couldn't follow HRC's example and create an exciting collection of music with a bit more variety to appeal to all ears. I'd buy HRC's Being Out Rocks collection instead."
4,Cool game,"I had GTR, but it did not work when I built a new machine and put Vista on it. GTR2 works fine on Windows Vista. The only negative is that the online races are not compatible (apparently not too many have version 2). The UI is pretty slick graphically, but not standard like normal applications. Maybe it's just me cause I don't play many games. I don't yet have a steering wheel, but would recommend it. I'm using a joystick right now, and it is hard to control. The game has incredible realism. Even the various cars handle very different."
4,Very accuract Racing Game,"Almost too accurate. Physics are realistic, but that doesn't make it as fun as other racing games are. I imagine it would be better with a steering wheel instead of KB controlls."
4,"Realistic WOW factor, really hard to learn","With a top notch computer and monitor, this cannot be called a game, truly a simulation. With the G25 Logitech wheel, shifter, and pedals this is really driving. Really hard to learn because of it's realism. The driving school is tedious requiring many hours to complete, but without it you just could not compete in the races unless you've had real racing experience on the track. If you love hard driving, and have patience, this will keep you in front of your screen for hours. Wish they provided better settup directions, but there are many fan websites that help and folks who provide advise. Have fun."
2,Very hard to play,"I have to be completely fair - others on the Amazon review postings warned about this - that GTR2 is NOT easy to play. I figured that it might be a little difficult, but not as difficult as it really is! As others have said, you cannot simply sit down and start flying around the track! Even the practice sessions are difficult to pass! Playing on the keyboard is virtually impossible (at least for me) - so I used a Logitech Rumblepad which did help, but still quite difficult. So I basically decided that I don't have the time to really learn how to play this game and will stick to easier ones!However, the graphics are indeed amazing. If you are really serious about racing games (I found out I am not very serious) then this game is probably for you!"
3,"no suport, no available updates","There's a 1.1 and a 1.5 update available, but there's no tech support to install it. I've tryed several times to install the updates and I can't. I'm not useing Gtr2 because I can't get any help with the updates."
3,Not for the casual racer,"This game has good graphics, lots of details & choices but for me, the camera is too close in & the controls too sensitive. I found after awhile it just wasn't that much fun. If you're a hard core racer I'd say this would be a good addition to your racing games but if you just want something fairly easy & fun, I'd say try something else."
5,Great cot!,"This cot is used by the grown-ups in our camping group to get a decent night's sleep. Setup is rough the first time (took about 10 minutes), gets easier as you get familiar with how things fit together (now down to 1 minute setup). It's wide enough, stable, and sturdy. The support bars are far enough from the sleep surface that you won't get the bars in your back."
4,Works fantastic!,"Slept on it for 3 wks. while waiting to get into a new place; just bought a $20 foam pad from Fred Meyer and a sleeping bag. It was a little difficult getting the last part attached, since it was so stiff, but there was no wiggling or wobbling."
5,Just What I Wanted,"I think I already did this last week, but here goes again. I got exactly what I wanted, the price was reasonable, and the quality of the book's condition - even though sold as used - was excellent. Thank you very much!!!"
3,ok keyboard,Inexpensive and lacks lots of features but it's price was very reasonable so bang for the buck is pretty fair
5,Good,"Good for the price paid, certainly there are other options is you want a GREAT quality product, however this keyboard works perfectly!"
2,Nice keyboard but the SHIFT key stuck,"For the price, the keyboard has a nice feel. Unfortunately, the left SHIFT key had a tendency to stick very frequently. Unsticking required pressing the key with significant effort multiple times. I returned it to Amazon for a refund."
5,Good basic Keyboard,"This was exactly what I had in mind. It is easy to use, inexpensive and good quality. I had purchased one for slightly less and found the quality to be lacking, the lettering was done with stickers that would have worn off. This is a good basic keyboard and was highly rated on one of the search site I looked it. I'm very pleased."
1,Died on me,"First the shift keys stopped working, and then the entire keyboard died. Switching USB's did nothing. As it stands I paid twelve dollars for a one-month keyboard. I'll update this review if it somehow starts working again."
2,It works but cheap look and feel,I was disapointed - I expected more for the money - I was able to pick up a MS keyboard for a few buck more that had a far more soild feels to it. The keys are noisy and very mushy - Don't get me wrong it works but the look and feel screem lowest bidder -
4,Very good average keyboard,"I researched keyboards before settling on this one. There's a lot of personal preference in how one is going to like a keyboard, and I've found I like the Logitech keyboards. This is several steps up from the cheapest keyboards, yet it's still modestly priced, and it works very well. Good level of comfort for the fingers typing, good positive action so I know when a key has been pressed. I'm a touch-typist, and I find I can type very quickly on it. But of course YMMV."
4,"Cool keyboard, clueless tech support","Keyboard has a good feel and isn't too clacky.The dedicated function buttons along the top (browser home page, calculator, volume mute or adjust) are a totally handy extra, but I went through a lot of grief getting the calculator button to actually work on my XP system. Tech support responded quickly, but instructed me to take numerous time-consuming steps that didn't work. After they gave up and told me to call my computer manufacturer, I managed to fix the problem myself (copy calc.exe into the Windows System32 folder). Now that everything works, I'm happy with the product.My only remaining complaint is that the e-mail function key launches Outlook and not a browser-based client like Firefox. But that's a Windows issue, not really Logitech's fault. You cannot specify Firefox as your default e-mail client."
3,h key went out,Always had good luck with logitech products. Had keyboard for about 3 week and h key quit working. I know this is not common with logitech products. Just got a bad keyboard. Would probably cost more to send back than to buy another one. Will continue to buy logitech products.
5,Keyboards,I am very happy with the reasonably priced Logtech keyboard I recently purchased. Years ago I spent much more for a keyboard that just didn't feel right. This one fits and works very well and I recommend it highly.
4,Awesome keyboard for the price,"I bought this keyboard as a replacement for my little cousin. As we all know, logitech is a well known brand that does not disappoint. This keyboard is meant for regular typing use and not hardcore gaming of any sort.For this price, we should all know what we will get; a well built long lasting basic keyboard for basic use. Handle it with care and you will get your moneys worth."
3,"It's not perfect, but it works","I got this one yesterday. The first thing that I noticed was that it looked really cheap. But right I know it is cheap. My second notice - the spacebar has a strange form, I hope I will get used to it. These were the minor problems, add up to 1 minus. When I put the keyboard on a table it was absolutely unsteady. I've released the supporters, but it was still unsteady. It was impossible to type. Then I put a piece of cardboard under one of the supporters, and now it's better. Considering all the minuses Logitech Internet 350 gets 3. But actually I don't mind any minor defects since it works. I only needed a cheap working keyboard. Now I have one."
2,Cheap but solid...,"It seems to be well built, but I do find myself having to bang on some of the keys rather more than usual to register. Especially for upper case. And I'm a heavy hitter of the keys too! But otherwise fine, and for the price is great. I'd resent paying more than $30 on other keyboards that only cost a few bucks to make."
5,Better than expected,"For the price I expected a basic keyboard. This one has several software keys, including mute, volume and common apps. Exceeded my expectations."
5,Works Just Fine.,"I bought this because I suspected the keyboard on my 2-month old Eee PC 900 broke, and I had to find out if the rest was going to work with a good keyboard. Too bad I had a hard time getting my keyboard repaired by Asus, and I just said ""Forget about repair from Asus, consider that the last item I would ever buy from Asus!"" as soon as I found a load of replacement keyboards for Eee PC available on eBay - I guess it all makes sense... :(This Logitech keyboard is just great. I love the feel of the keys, and wish I have more use for it as I only use laptops."
3,Didnt hold up,"Thing just didnt have much quality to it and overall dissatified with its functions,or lack thereof.Sticky keys.Wasnt sad when I replaced it.Honestly my emachine keyboard is better."
4,Logitech Keyboard Review,"This product is very well done. I like the design and how they have controls on the top of the keyboard. It is very to use and program certain keys. It is very comfortable to type with the board they have at the bottom of the keyboard that lets you wrist rest on. However, the noise of this keyboard is annoying since at night when one of us is using the computer, we can hear the typing in the next room. The other downside of this product is it is very hard to clean since the dust goes beneath the keys where it is unreachable. This keyboard should be updated to look like the mac keyboards. The packaging was very good since it was tight and had package bubbles around it."
3,great but doesn't last long,I use this everyday to protect my teeth from biting directing onto the whistle. I tend to grind alot and this didn't last more than a week. If you grind like I do then save your money and teeth and go for something else.
2,Does what it's supposed to do but doesn't last long.,"They only last for about six months and then they get dirty pretty quick and start to tear. For a buck or so, it probably wouldn't be such a big deal, but at $8 bucks a pop, it's not worth it. I think there are other vendors that sell them at the same price for a dozen."
2,Too many pictures. Not enough explanation,"While Mr. Hochheim may be an accomplished martial artist, and could probably slaughter me in a knife fight without breaking a sweat, this book is sub-par, even by knife combat book standards. This is another case of someone who is an expert in the area that they write about but who lacks the writing abilities to fully convey the concepts they present. Many of the illustrations in this book are handed to the reader without almost any written explanation of the techniques. The author seems to expect the reader to draw the necessary information from the pictures alone. For a combat expert this is fine, but for the novice this is less than satisfactory and perhaps even dangerous, if the student tries to perform the techniques in a real fight without a real understanding of how they should be properly executed."
5,Comfy,These shoes are quite comfy. They kind of have a squish to the step that I rather enjoy. I don't know what the guy was smoking who said these are uncomfortable. If you have all your motor skills the buckles shouldn't be a problem. It is a little quicker than laces (depending on how quick you are with laces). I was surprised to find a 10 1/2 was a little big on my foot. VERY glad I didn't get 11's. This may be a mark of Kenneth Cole shoes (as I understand these were manufactured by). I bought a pair of 11 (diff shoes) that are Kenneth Coles and found them far too large to wear. Anyone looking for some size 11 Coles? =] A Great pair of shoes that are nice and stylish!
2,ouch.,"they look cool, but there are two problems.1). the manmade material fades at the creases right away.2). they HURT. not comfortable at all."
2,Got what paid for,"It's a very cheap material that you often see selling in flea market.After 1 day wear, I dumped them in garbage can (first I planned donate them to Salvation Army but feel bad for people who would receive them so I threw them out in garbage).It will hurt your foot and looked so stupid in reality _ absolutely not like in picture shown.Never buy shoes online or at least not by Unlisted name."
4,Nice shoes...,"For the price, these shoes are nice! they are very comfortable and stylish. I've been wearing them a few weeks now and they are slowly working their way to my ""favorite shoe"" closet."
3,kenneth cole buckle,"the show is cheaply made but a good deal for the price. the buckle is such a pain in the butt, you have to undo it and redo it and it takes 2x more then regular laces."
1,THIS IS NOT A 4 PACK!!,"Amazon! Hello! This item is not listed correctly. This item is sold individually, not as a 4 pack!!!! Please change this to help customers avoid a huge headache!!!"
1,this gun is awfol.,"first off my gun broke because it came with a batterie cord ripped off and the semi auto swich was stuck. the gun can barely shoot up to 40 yards. and it has a meerley 220fps...and for how bad that gun is to add 20$ shipping on it too? talk about ripp off. i wouldnt recomend this gun to anyone, not even begginers. please dont get this gun. dont go on this site... better site airsplat.com i just orderd a well vsr-10 mb03 sniper rifle and it shoots 450fps and is only 70$"
4,Very nice,"This is my second garden seat. The first one finally broke, I had resewed the seat four times. What happens is that when you lean forward to work it stresses the stitching that holds the seat to the frame and eventually the frame bends as well. Hopefully this one is sturdier than the last one. So far so good. On the plus side this love the seat because I can place it anywhere in my garden I need to work (as opposed to the rolling type)and I like the pockets. The seat part could be a little bigger."
2,Didn't catch,"After about 100 pages, I just simply found a lot of the stories hard to follow. I kept asking myself ""What happened that led to the events that I'm reading about to occur?"" For example, the one what if ""What if the South wasn't defeated in the Civil War?"" I was wondering the exact sequence of events, and was left hanging. In short, there's better out there."
1,"Been There, Done That","If you are serious about AH fiction, you may find a certain sense of deja vu as you read this. Every single story in this collection has appeared before in Mike Resnick's ALETRNATE (fill in title) series or Bedford and Greenberg's WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN series, so if you have every volume of these prior collections you will be simply buyting a second copy of stories you already possess. If you are new to AH, this makes a good intro to the genre, but otherwise the only use you may have for this is to loan out to newbies you wish to introduce to this field if you only trust them with one book at a time."
2,A weak collection,"I'll be the outlier to the other, mostly positive reviews. The stories by Robert Silverberg and L. Sprague de Camp are worthwhile, and Michael Flynn's ""The Forest of Time"" is nicely done. Of the rest, however, two are downright silly and one pathetic. The rest shade to mediocrity. If you are looking for an anthology, I think Alternate Generals is more consistently successful."
4,Great intro to Uchronia for me,"By far, the two best stories were among the book's longest: Michael F. Flynn's ""The Forest of Time"" and L. Sprague de Camp's ""Aristotle and the Gun."" A couple of the shorter ones were forgettable or incomprehensible. Several were merely above average. I loved the premise of Harry Turtledove's ""Must and Shall,"" but the execution was not on par with the ones I cited above."
3,Good Summer Reading,"First let me say that I am not a fan of short stories. I enjoy getting a novel and living with it for a while. Regardless, I liked this collection of short stories. I particullarly liked the one where a time traveler has to live with the changes that they made. I only wish that each of the stories were novels."
3,Good Stories--Broad Themes,Good short stories that compensate in length and detail for direct focus on varying universal themes.
3,Not Recommended,"Although some of these stories are pretty good, the majority are either boring, corney, or even distasteful. I am an avid AH reader and I would not recommend this book to anyone new to AH or even those like me who have read other books on the subject."
3,A good collection,"A good sampling of alternate histories, Gene Wolfe's contribution especially, but not the best out there. I enjoyed it but not enough to keep for myself and passed it on to a friend, prefering other, meatier collections."
3,Roads not taken,"It was not what I thought it was going to be, but it is okay as there are some aspects that I have found interesting while reading it."
5,Top-notch,Two quality SF mag editors combine and produce one of the top anthologies in alternate history. ALL stories are exceptional...the price makes it a terrific starting point if you're exploring this genre for the first time. Highly recommended!
2,Not as expected,"I read very good reviews about the book in one of the magazines, but the book turns out not what I have expected (it just another fiction story)."
4,Some great stories.,"Dozois is known for editing Asimov's & the year' best series while Shmidt is the editor of Analog. Anyway this experience makes them pretty good at choosing great stories. From masters of alternate history like DeCamp & Turtledove, to others better known for other kinds of work. Stories for all sorts of taste & if you like their tastes maybe you'll like the magazines they edit. I bet that's what they are hoping for anyway, but I for one hope that their plan works."
5,Ferron rules!,"I recommend this album (and Shadows On A Dime) for anyone, straight or gay, who loves heartfelt, insightful love songs. Love is love!"
3,I hope Blue under Ground Re-releases this,The sound is terrible you can barely hear the people talk but the music is really loud...so are the screamsThe picture quality is ok but I would love to see this come out on blue underground's Blu-Ray
1,"great film, lousy dvd","Just to back up the very critical review of this dvd below, this is a major disappointment: the one star is for the quality of the dvd release, not the film, which is one of Bava's best pictures. The image here is really substandard, way below what should be expected from any serious dvd release in this day and age. Although it is anamorphic, it would be hard to call this in any way improved over the first VCI release; if anything, in sharpness and color, it might actually be worse. That a dvd release this mediocre is a rerelease is a travesty; if they want to get people to upgrade and buy again, it should be for a better product. Stay away from this one and hope for another version to come. I had heard bad things but ordered anyway since it was relatively inexpensive, hoping that Tim Lucas's involvement would mean that this was a quality dvd; unfortunately, not the case."
1,Won't play on some DVD players,"WARNING! This disc has a known problem with not being able to play in a Philips/Magnavox 825 and some Pioneer players including: DV-414, DV-515, and DVL-909."
4,"Wildly stylish, fun, and engaging, if not perfect","A great looking murder mystery that clearly laid the groundwork for later directors(DePalma in particular), and has a fun macabre sense of humor to go with somevery effective tension.Considered a masterpiece by many, I can't quite go there, with the bad dubbing,some over the top acting, and a few silly twists. But that's not to say I didn't really enjoy it.Someone is killing models at a high fashion house, and there are plentyof suspects to go around.Bava's use of color is wonderful, if not quite up to what he did in his own`Whip and the Body', and there's also very effective use of shadows andmoving lights. Yes, many of those devices are now visual clichés, butsomeone had to invent them, and Bava gets a lot of the credit."
4,Mixed thoughts. Not sure what I think. Worth a watch definitely,I'd say the film lives up to the recommendations I received to watch it but not sure how I feel overall. Good story good script maybe the lighting and the pacing at times threw me off. Will watch again and see if anything changes. I do not think you will see an experience like this from Hollywood nor in this period now. Have to catch to form your own opinion.
2,great film poor quality DVD,"Mario Bava is the godfather of giallo and Italian horror with ""Blood and Black Lace"" being one of his masterpieces. Unfortunately, this DVD does not do this great film justice. The colors are muddled and the sound is a disgrace. Quite often the voices are not loud enough but the biggest problem is that sound and image are not in sync. With a dubbed film you cannot expect perfection but with this DVD the voices don't even come close to the mouth movements. It's a serious syncing problem as the sounds of doors slamming, women getting slapped, footsteps and knocking on doors do not match the images. It's all very distracting making watching this DVD quite difficult. I was very disappointed!"
3,Angle of handle is all WRONG on this pot . . .,"For some reason, AllClad set the angle of the handle much shallower than on their other pots and pans--the angle is similar to a fry pan. When you lift the pan off the stove, the rim of the pan does not remain level. This is especially annoying if you are working with this pan alongside several pots. A minor detail perhaps. Otherwise, an excellent pan, great for cooking rice and reducing sauces."
3,Pro looks-amateur finish,"having an assortment of All-Clad pieces, I couldn't pass up the rare All-Clad MC2 sale.Like the rest of the line, the MC2 has a stainless steel interior. The difference is in the brushed aluminum exterior. That's where the problem lies. Apparently this finish is a tad more porous than the LTD line. I keep getting 'stains' that require the Barkeeper's Friend. No big deal-but for a pan of this price, easy maintenence should be mandatory.Wait for the LTD sale instead."
2,Not the Best Effort,"It was hard for me to believe that the Swan's War books were written by the author of Initiate Brother. The first two books were pleasant and interesting enough that I bought the third, The Shadow Roads."" Unfortunately, I found that instead of reading a story about endless war fueled by the weaknesses of human character, as detailed in the first two long novels, I was reading about a supernatural love triangle, which caused endless war as a side effect. The climactic resolution was effected by characters who had less than 10 pages of development out of a thousand, and all of the subplots and story lines were revealed as irrelevant.If I had not previously read outstanding work by Sean Russell, I would give up on this author."
1,Poor Design! The food falls out!,"Doesn't open all the way and doesn't stay open. Very hard to get the food in to the basket. For vegetables this product is not a good fit. The vegetables fall out of the basket and end up at the bottom of the BBQ. It's really hard to open, and it's even harder to get it open once it's off the hot BBQ. Would never recommend this product."
1,Poor Quality Control,"The bracket for the handle on the basket had a poor weld, not being able to support the weight of the basket, so it snapped apart rendering the the product useless. The bracket should be designed to be more integral to the basket frame so it can support the weight of the basket and the food to be grilled in the basket."
1,I HATE IT BECAUSE,"I find it very difficult to open and close, and it's not wide enough for chicken. The handle is difficult to use, and the non-stick capability does not work all that well. It came out of the dishwasher in need of hand cleaning. I'll probably throw it out."
4,nice product,"I would give this product a five star if the food wouldn't stick and wasn't so hard to clean up. I marinated some small trout in an oil based marinate then oiled the basket really good, but the fish still stuck. I love the detachable handle and the no hassle way you can turn the food without tearing it up. All in all, the pros outweigh the cons. If one doesn't mind the food sticking and having to apply a little elbo grease cleaning it up, I highly reccomend the product."
4,Great for grilling wings,works really great for grilling wings can flip them all at once and avoid burning your hands doing it. Remember to spray with Pam for eazier cleanup
2,"Great idea, poor execution","I am looking for a long time for a grill basket with detachable handle so I can close the lid. This is the only product I know with this feature. Unfortunately, other reviews are true about the closing mechanism: It will open when turning over the basket and you will have the food all over the grill."
3,Grill Basket,"The Grilling basket is OK - but for steaks, the meat needs to be very thick - otherwise, they slide around when you move the basket. Have not tried it with fish - probably same issue will apply, must be a thick cut or the fish will slide around inside when you move/flip the basket."
4,scanner,Product works but the driver was hard to find and download from USA locations. Had do download from a Cannon Europe website.
2,Software for the scanner includes spyware,"The scanner seems to do well with scanning to .pdf files. The OCR software does not seem very good, though, and the document feeder has not worked too well for me. Most frustrating is that the software for the scanner includes SPYWARE that Norton Antivirus has identified and cannot remove. My efforts to follow Norton instructions on how to remove the spyware from my registry also has not worked.Shame on Canon."
5,Top of the Line,"We needed a good, easy to clean 8"" fry pan. This is a well constructed skillet with a handle that stays cool. We use it for eggs and such and it is so easy to keep clean. There is little food sticking even though it isn't tefflon and the heat distribution is perfect."
4,Great pan,"but, don't really like the master chef bottoms.. it wears off easily.. and the rim is very sharp.. be careful when cleaningbut its still an awesome pan.. us it all the time"
4,Better Cook,These pans are fabulous the heat quickly and evenly. The only even near negative is the cost. I would recommend them to friends and have given one as a gift.
3,"Passable, ...","I bought this deck as something to work with before I made my own tarot cards. It works well enough for its purpose, but the meanings and such are way too watered down. For instance, tghey substitute the Death card with Rebirth and the Devil card with Choice. Since when was Choice such a bad thing as to be related to a generally negative card? Also, the format (warrior instead of Knight, God/Goddess for King/Queen, Seeker for Page) is confusing. The method of using titles instead of 8 of cup or whatever is also tough when trying to translate over into more traditional decks. Don't even look at the book, other than for the translations from this deck to the traditional one. It is sugary sweet and does not serve a purpose when trying to get the true meaning of a reading. However, the deck itself works as well as any, and has beautiful artwork. If you're more of a Rider-Waite fan, don't bother."
1,Odd...confusing,"This deck is odd, to each his own, I suppose. Firstly, swords and wands are transposed, with swords representing fire and wands representing air. This would be OK to work with, except the card meaning are not representative of the elements....the meanings of the swords are still equated with knowledge, intellect, thought, justice and truth...but are now associated with fire, rather than air. The wands cards represent creativity, action, movement, enthusiasm, and career....but are classed under the element of air....this is rather confusing to new readers who are used to the Rider-Waite associations.The hierophant as elephant?? Surely that must be a joke.I just can't take this deck seriously. I'd call it more bizarre than inspired."
3,Wonderful imagery.,I agree with all of the previous reviews about this deck but I do want to note one disappointment I found. The cards are not manufactured as thickly or solidly as all of my other decks. They are quite flimsy. I find I'm almost afraid to shuffle them as they might crease or bend permanently and distort the beautiful pictures.
5,This is most amazing tarot deck I have ever used.,"DEFFINITELY THE BEST TAROT DECK OUT THERE! After buying the deck, I sat down and did some readings for some of my friends, and we were all amazed at how right on the cards were. The images are splendid, and the book very informative although the cards are so easy to use that I found myself not having to refer to the book. This deck is for people who are looking for something more than just a traditional deck. The idea of shapeshifting and using power animals is great, and I'm looking forward to other books on this subject. I highly recommend this deck to all who use tarot to do readings for themselves and others. The cards are very accurate."
4,"I would rate half of this book/deck a 10, the other half a 5","There is definitely two distinct voices in this book, and at times they conflict with each other. One author writes tarot descriptions which are redundant, at best, while the other writes inspiring, insightful, and useful information - which is perfect for the beginner as well as the more advanced tarot enthusiast.I admire and greatly respect D. J. Conway's skill as a writer in this genre and therefore was somewhat disappointed in ""Shapeshifter Tarot."" However, I know (based on what I've seen and heard thus far) that her next tarot book and deck will indeed be a 10!As for the illustrations in ""Shapeshifter Tarot,"" Lisa Hunt's work is a stroke of magical genius, which just keeps getting better! I'm looking forward to seeing the next tarot deck she illustrates."
5,Powerful Deck!,This deck was amazing! The artwork was beautiful and creative. This is the most acurate deck I have ever had!
5,Fantastic for anyone of the Old Religion who does tarot,"This deck of tarot cards is a beautiful deck. The artwork is spectacular and easy for anyone who is learning to do tarot. This is only the second deck I have used and I believe this will be the last deck I use. It is very forthright as long as you do not take every card description literally. One must be able to feel the energy from the person you are reading in order to give an accurate reading. While this deck is beautiful it will not automatically make you a tarot reader. One must learn the skills prior to becoming experienced. I would definately recommend this deck to anyone, however I would not recommend someone purchasing it just for the artwork. While I wholeheartedly would say this is the last deck for me I would also have to say that you need to buy the tarot deck that calls to you not just the one that looks pretty."
3,"CUte, but not big enough...","Not what I expected. I thought it would have been bigger when I received it. Very cute though if this is what you are looking for. I am trying to return it and get my money back. We will see. otherwise it is very soft and plush. Cute, just my 4 yr old wanted a GIANT BROWN MONKEY and this isn't giant enough for her. LOL!"
2,[Knock off],"Okay, this book promises good stuff, but ... could it be any harder to understand? You basically need two books to interpret how to make a single pattern. Very vague. We use this book at FIDM and I think it would have been better if the two books we use were put into one. Use it if you must, because it is a good reference for children's and body suits. Also, the illustrations are better than most."
3,Pattern Making for Fashion Design,"The book is great and very useful, I did buy the book used to save some $$, but it was listed as like new condition. The book I received was not like new--there are a two pretty good quarter sized scrape marks on the cover and spin of the book and there is writting on some of the pages inside. This is not like new to me. So just be aware that you may not get the condition as it is listed! I'm still thinking of sending this back--for almost $100 I think it should be blimish free!"
3,Designing is a whole new world!,"I am fairly new to sewing and, while using the third edition of this book, I continually came up with problems getting the assignments done for class. The third edition has left out many of the basic instructions which are needed for the more novice seamstress. In addition, there were errors in calculations that even I, as a beginner, found. The second edition is more comprehensive and more geared to those with limited knowledge and experience in this field. I would recommend using the second edition for those individuals who may need a little more direction in designing and completing garments."
2,I couldnt get them open,These wouldve been perfect for my industrial piercing but I couldnt get the earrings pen. I dont know if its me but it just wouldnt budge
4,Probably the best of the E-Series cases,"I'm a fan of cases that TOTALLY protect the phone without sacrificing useability. I'm so convinced that this is the one, that when I upgraded to the E51 I, in turn, bought the Classic Multidapt case for that model too. Takes a while to stretch enough for easy on-off, but once it's ""formed"" it is good to go."
2,A gift,I purchased this item as a gift and the recipient is extremely happy with it. I was pleased with the price compared to its cost at other major retailers.
2,True adventure!,"You have to love true adventure if you are to come to Nicaragua.You will feel alive and connected to ""life"" so pack the essentials and come!"
2,An Iranian masterpiece?,"This novella is about a young man quite fond of wine and opium, who sees a beautiful but mysterious woman through a ventilation hole in his closet. He goes back to the closet three days later to look for her, but there is no such aperture there. He is in despair over ""losing"" her, but several weeks later she shows up outside of his front door. He invites her in, and she lies on his bed. He touches her, and realizes she is dead. From there on, the story is more morbid and surreal, and he eventually descends into madness.If you like Edgar Allan Poe, you'll probably like this novella. If not, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Good service,I bought a book from this provide. I didnt pay for fast shipping and received my book fairly later than what I thought. But the book was in good condition. It was very satisfactory overall.I would buy from this seller again.
4,80 Proof Bleak,"The Blind Owl is just about the most exquisitely written piece of pure darkness I have read -- a tribute to both author and translator. Chronicling the descent into madness of a man plagued by opium addiction and the torments of his coquetting wife, Hedayat's mixture of streams of consciousness and vivid accounts of events is a particularly powerful device. Recommended for those interested in modern Middle-Eastern literature."
4,Great for Napping,"La Chaise Folding Recliner - Black With Tan MeshThis is the most comfortable outdoor recliner I've ever sat in. It's not the most practical because it's still rather large when it's folded. It doesn't make the best chair for sitting up to eat or sit around a campfire, but if you want to just sit and relax or recline for an outdoor nap, this is the chair to get. Very comfortable and sturdy."
1,Very disapointed...,"My wife and I ordered 2 of the Pacific Outdoors 17-LC120La Chaise Folding Recliners and were disapointed that one of them was defective right out of the box. One of the rivets that hold the support arms was shipped with it loose in the box. I pulled the second one out and could feel the stress of my weight bearing down on the fragile frame. I weigh 260 lbs, and the chair is suppose to hold 300 lbs but after seeing the other chairs problem, I decide to return them both."
3,"Great Starter, falls short for the aspiring professional","This book is good for a newcomer to search engine optimization, but anyone who has been working on promoting a website will already know or assume all of the information in this book. If you are brand new to SEO then this book is a good starting point, but otherwise spend your time browsing the web or using SEO descussion forums, because the information will be more current and more in debth."
5,Track List,Pierre J - I'm In The Mood / Dunkla / 1995 /Track listing1. I'm in the Mood - (Original Mix)2. I'm in the Mood - (Hard Nights Mix)3. I'm in the Mood - (Prince Quick Vocal)4. I'm in the Mood - (Prince Quick Dub)5. I'm in the Mood - (Original Dub)
4,Fun Wiccan Reading,This book contains a lot of short stories with Wiccan characters. I was more than happy Bast was brought to life one more time. I love her!
4,rocker review,"Works great! Did an accent wall in my living room and everyone that has seen it, loves the look of the faux wood."
3,Rather Poor Quality,This little gadget is really not put together too well and I doubt it is going to last through more than one painting project. The grid that makes the pattern is glued to the wooden handle and then stapled on as well. Most of the staples on mine were falling out and the glue was releasing. As long as I keep fiddling with it to keep it together it works. Kind of hard to wash out because the more water I use the weaker the adhesive on the head gets. All in all not well made.
5,Organized and good!,I have been seriously collecting only a few months now and have decided to sell. This book is well organized and the best of 3 reference books on flow blue that I have. The hard cover is a good idea since I think I would wear it down to stubs if it had been a paperback!!
4,All Clad Lifetime Warranty? Yes!,"Two of my non-stick pans have been sent back to All Clad. Stay tuned for their response to see if they back up their pans. Update: All-clad offered no communication about the warranty or the status of my exchange - however they sent a new 12"" pan to me with no explanation or letter about my other pan. +1 for new pan, -1 for communication. 2/10/10 the other pan came - review? All Clad backs up their pans!They are good pans, but honestly I would rate a Lodge brand Cast Iron (the original non-stick) a 5 for durability and value. Easily scratched, handle front and back have spots that will eventually coat with oils. A pleasure when they are new."
2,Inferior to previous Emerilware saucepans,"I received this 3 qt Emerilware saucepan from All-Clad after sending in my good 3/12 qt Emerilware saucepan under warantee. The nonstick coating was peeling. I bought the 3 1/2 qt and a 2 1/2 qt at the same time, about 3 years ago, each had a lifetime warantee. They were made in Korea, designed by All-Clad. The metal was heavy and solid, advertised as 5 mm.The replacement pan (the sauce pan being reviewed) is stamped 3 qt (I returned a 3 1/2 qt), but is identical in dimensions to my older 2 1/2 qt Emerilware, except 12 ounces lighter (yes, LIGHTER than the pan marked 2 1/2 qt). The metal is thinner, perhaps nearly 1/2 as thick, and I would never have bought the sauce pan of that thickness. This pan is made in China.I wouldn't buy this pan knowing what I know. I'd look for something heavier. And the lifetime warantee is no good to you, if they no longer make an item of the same quality as what you are returning. I feel cheated with little recourse."
5,Just what I needed,Just what I need. Thanks so much. They are hard to find and I use them in my fireplace log.Makes the room cozy.
5,wonderful color,I like the bulbs that r clred all the way through. Not justclear glass. When lit its a beautiful color. I got red n green n oranhge. Great prices alsoDelivery ws great.
2,I tried...,"You either love a Sutcliffe novel or you hate it... At least that's what I've always discovered...Notorious started out clever, witty and a breath of fresh air original, but it slowly but surely lost it's appeal. I did like the characters; Destiny was spunky and not the usual ""lady of society"" and Jason was a Lord (a high member of the Ton) but ran a team of undercover assassins.Destiny's father's in trouble in India and she and Jason go to save him.The point it started getting ridiculous was when Jason went undercover as a scarred captain of his ship and didn't reveal his identity to Destiny until later on in the story...Blah!I really tried to keep myself interested in this story, but it just got away from me."
2,"Interesting setting & sub-plot in India, so-so romance","The book moved along nicely, cool bits of India's history, and it was interesting that they consummated their love so early on in the storyline. However those were the highlights. The heroine was one-dimensional and a little too perfect, young, and gorgeous. The hero was quite good... until he raped the heroine. I hate rape scenes in romance novels, where suddenly while being raped the heroine starts liking it. Please Ms. Sutcliffe! A Nasty, horrid scene. What a terrible thing for a young woman to read. Rape is violence, not romance."
2,Don't bother reading this book,"This book has certain moments, but it has too many faults for it to be a good book. First of all, in the 1800s, there was no such thing as colored contact lenses that the hero uses to disguise himself. The ""makeup"" he uses seems like it came out of Hollywood instead of the 19th century. There is use of quotes like, ""What a tangled web we weave..."", and other language which seems too modern. The subplot of the hero and his assassin brother was too 2-dimensional, as was many many of its side characters. I almost wanted to toss the book away, but I finished it because I was on a plane for 4 hours. It is NOT an entertaining book because of all the inconsistencies and time jumps. Oh yes, the heroine, who gets pregnant, is given opium....lovely. Don't bother reading this book. It is not ""the best historical romance novel"" as it says in the back cover....Don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,A Honey of a Historical!,"If you like a good romantic story by a top writer, Notorious is a honey of a historical romance. Sutcliffe is the master of grabbing the reader's attention at the beginning and not letting up until the wonderful, satisfactory finish."
1,Horrible book! 0 stars,"I love Katherine Sutcliffe, but this book was so horrible that I could not even finish it. I skipped and skimmed until the end. It's going straight to the trash can.The heroine Destiny was an evil person! She actually thought she may have killed the hero and did not even go back to check on him. She had no remorse and did not feel very guilty about it. Then when she and her annoying aunt go aboard the hero's ship, and discover that the hero is the captain-the aunt shoots him! Destiny doesn't even show that she cares that the stupid aunt shot him, while he is trying to save her father and everything. I HATED Destiny and her aunt's characters. This book was just terrible."
3,Great looking shoe but uncomfortable.,"I bought these sandals in black. I was excited when I got them because I like style of it. Looks are very deceiving, because, when I went to try them on, I could barely put my foot into it. The ARCH of the shoe is designed to high which makes it very difficult to wear. The sandal is also for a narrow foot."
5,great product!,"I bought two sets this christmas: a beautiful green for my young daughter and a black one for my mother.They are both extremely happy with them. So I'm going for the red one for myself.Handles are plastic which suits me well because they are very light.The silicone looked very well attached to the plastic handles so no worries here.Product came in perfect condition.I was reading some comments and frankly, some people rated this set very poorly: Do they melt when you leave them on the pan? But of course! Who would cook leaving the utensils on the pan???"
3,Yikes! Plastic handles!!!,"Well, i was quite disappointed when i opened my package. Here i was thinking that my search for a silicone ""Wok"" Turner was over. The heads of each utensil is in fact silicone but the handles are plastic. I dont know if you can actually see, but if you look carefully enough, you will notice 2 different colorations on these utensils and that is where the plastic starts. The utensils are useful tho, but im sure they will be in the garbage soon with all the rest of my plastic utensils.BTW..they also kinda look and feel cheap."
5,Very satisfied!,"Have been using for about 1 month. Very happy with these utensils! Well made, nice color, nice size."
4,Love the spoons (color a little off),We use the spoons all the time on stainless and non-stick. Color is not very vibrant and they look old when new but we have another one that is a few years old and we love them.
3,Not the Best Silicone,"Discovered how great silicone utensils were after purchasing a couple of Food Network products. For some reason it is difficult to find slotted spoons, so when I saw this set, I purchased it. Although these are as expensive as the Food Network ones, they are not as good in the quality area. They are harder to clean and leave a sort of white film. The silicone isn't as 'slick' if that makes sense. They are OK, but for the money, I would recommend Food Network utensils."
4,Better than the small lemur,"This figure is MUCH better and more detailed than the small ring-tailed lemur that is included in Safari's ""Monkeys & Apes"" tube (the latter of which had wrong coloration for one thing). It's nice and sturyd, and a decent size too. If you're a lemur or primate lover like myself, you'd do well to get this and opt out of the tube"
3,Uneven but still cool ...,"It's been a while since I've checked out a Digital joint and nostalgia played a factor in my picking this one up. It's a decent effort, highlighted by party anthem ""Holla Holiday"" and the smooth, ambient stylings of ""Man's Girl"", but don't expect anything on par with ""Sex Packets"" and ""Sons of the P"""
3,any more gravy?,i dont have many complaints on this album except it seemed noticably short for an effort that was over 2 years in the making....on the other side that means there aren't any fast forward tracks on here but i would've wanted more music for all the time they took off....none the less it is another solid offering from the tripped out underground
4,The D.U. is still mixing good gravy.,"The rap conglomeration which spawned Humpty Hump, 2Pac, baby dope, et.al., is still laying the infectious dance tracks and unique vocal stylings. The ""shake-your-rump"" show stopper ""Wind Me Up"" features Humpty at his best as he truly gets the party started. ""A Man's Girl"" is reminiscent of ""Freaks of the Industry"" with the vocal tag-teaming of Shock and Money B. The Digital Underground proves that they are spiciest heirs to the P-funk dynasty with ""Who's Got the Gravy?"""
4,COP THIS. A MUST FOR ALL HIPHOP HEADZ,"THE ONLY REASON I DIDNT GIVE IT A 5 IS BECAUSE I LISTEN TO THE SAME SONG EVERY TIME I PUT ON THIS CD SO ""3 BLIND MICE""... A DIGITAL UNDERGROUND MASTERPIECE FO SHO... BUT YE THERE ARE SOME OTHER SWEET CUTS ON HEAR 2 THO... COP TRA ""UNDAGROUND SUNSHINE"" IN STORES SPRING 2005... PEACEWWW.MADNOIZE.COM"
5,Spicy but not too embarrassing to break out at home!,"Blanca does it again in another video from World Dance New York with her instructional DVD Sensual Bellydance. This is ideal for those who want to enjoy their body in a whole new way while getting in shape and learning both new and old belly dancing moves. Unlike some intermediate level belly dance videos, Sensual Bellydance is accessible for beginners with absolutely no experience in the art.Blanca is definitely a likable instructor, and has a sincere warmth about her. She opens the beginning of the video reminding people that sensuality comes from within, and to enjoy the basics of life such as nature. Her instructional style is easy to follow, and though she has a soft Spanish accent it does not interfere with one's ability to clearly understand her directions. Blanca is also encouraging, and moves through the material at a pace good for beginners to belly dancing.[...]"
4,smooth!,"Good dvd to practice to. I like the way she keeps it smooth in this video. Isolations have their place, but getting the whole body into the dance is more enjoyable to watch, I believe. Very useful."
4,A great gift for your girlfriends!!,"Wow! I was amazed when I tried this DVD, it's so in-depth, extremely well done, the explanation for the moves is detailed, and the choreography sets are very very sensual. Blanca is a fabulous instructor and dancer, this DVD will really make you feel like a sensual woman, no matter your size or age, you will feel like a Venus!!"
4,"Good, Fun Exercise","Considering my treadmill is most often busy as stacking space in my living room and an exercise bike collects rust in the garage, it should be no surprise I find a lot of traditional exercise... well... BORING. That's why I purchased this DVD, and I'm quite glad I did. Belly dancing is a great workout. Definately worth the (quite affordable) Amazon price for a way to get moving and get in touch with your body while having some fun."
4,Great for the price,Great for the price. I like the choreo Blanca teaches in this dvd. One of the better dvd's put out by nyworlddance.
4,Wonderful!,"Blanca is a great instructor with a soft, sensual voice and style that is absolutely gorgeous. Her instructions are clear and precise. I hope to learn this choreography for the RenFaire in Nov. The title of the DVD is right on target."
2,Not for beginners,"I bought this dvd after reading all the wonderful reviews about how it's good for beginners. Well I opened it up and put it on and started to watch. While is was very lovely to look at, it was kind of hard to follow. It seemed more for someone who already had the basics down. The lady went kinda fast and just breezed through the movements. All in all I wouldnt say it's good for beginners. I kinda wish I could return it."
5,"Sensual Bellydance, Blanca","I had the Chance to take her workshop in New york City, what she does is amazing, you can see her soul, is a natural gift, she is beautiful sensual and loving person, her dance is a delighful experience, this DVD offer more than instructional video, gives you inspiration to look, feel a performe like her, Bravo Blanca."
5,Wonderful instructor!!,"Blanca is such an amazing instructor.... she helps with balance, grace, and brings out the sensual nature of bellydancing! She is so graceful and uses moves that are very slow to really work all your leg and abdominal muscles! This is an awesome workout!"
2,Really?,"I don't know where this dvd is getting all the good reveiews from. Weird outfits, weird music, boring dancing. The accent is hard to understand. A long, touchy-feely intro with scarves floating in the wind over an ocean cliff. I watched this once, and sent it back."
5,En verdad sensual!,"Muy bueno el DVD, enseña los pasos hasta lograr una coreografia. El ingles es lento asi que facil de entender para las latinas."
5,Sensual Bellydance,Love it. Too short. Would have liked to see more complete dance routines. Not so much training but more dancing. That would make it even more fun!
2,"Good information, bad music","Lots to learn from on this DVD but I just can't get past the music. I know people perform belly dance to other kinds of music than arabic, but I just can't listen to the stuff on this DVD for 2 hours. I have had the same problem with another belly dance DVD (Neon) from World Dance New York. Part of the beauty of learning a form of world dance is being able to listen to the music of the countries from which the dance originates. I also don't like the goddess stuff that World Dance puts in it's dvd's."
5,Good but mostly for beginners and intermediate,"I hear she is working on one that is the next level up. I can't wait for that one. This one is really good, but was a bit easy. However, the explanation of sensuality was great information."
3,Good to see Rod Cameron!,It is great that Rod Cameron westerns eventually are released. This one here is not one of the best though. It is a bit boring with too little action and Cameron himself seems a little bored. The credits go to John Ireland who is good as the on and of good and bad guy. The picture quality is not totally sharp but acceptable. I think I would have expected better from an MGM release.
2,This is a location not an adventure.,"The problem with stuff like this is that there is no level appropriate for it. It says that it is suitable for PCs of 2-15 level but the first encounter in one of the 3 towers is a band of half-ogres, the second is a band of armoured trolls. The 1st dungeon level after that is suitable for 1st-2nd levels except for more armoured trolls armed with pikes (which wiped out a party of 2 2nd level characters and 2 1st level characters immediately when I DMed it). The 2nd dungeon level has a pack of beholders on it! I guess Troy Denning hasn't heard the word 'balance', but then he did write ""The Verdant Passage"", one of the most badly-written books I have tried to read in recent times. Also, the artwork looks like 3rd rate marvel/DC stuff, in the grand tradition of T$R using worse and worse artists the richer they get."
2,"Not too bad, but...","...it's not as tightly written as THE COUNTESS, a prior novel of Ms. Luellen's which I enjoyed very much. Sometimes (particularly in the beginning of the story) it's difficult to tell which character is doing the speaking or thinking. For the most part, that problem straightens out as the story progresses, but then the plot becomes a bit convoluted. I never quite ""got"" the love that grew between Niall and Maura (the Romeo/Juliet main characters). Niall is violent and foul to her before they fall in love, and there's not a whole lot of repentance for it on his part, I think.The author piles on the tragedy (which sort of overwhelms the love story)by almost superfluously adding the massacre at Glencoe (when the Campbell clan slew the MacDonald clan) at the very end of the tale. The story also ends very abruptly.It's not a horrible read, but it's not very deep or involving one either."
3,"Nice, but the handles are not ""stay cool handles""","I was very disappointed when I went to pick up the pot without mitts and the ""stay-cool signature handles"" burned my fingers! That was one of the major reasons I decided to splurge and pay for All-Clad. It also left a couple spots/stains on the bottom of the pot after the first time cooking (that didn't come out with ""Bar Keepers Friend"" cleanser). Otherwise, it heats up very fast."
3,Taste was disappointing,"The seller (Fisherman's Fleet) was excellent, and I would order from him again.But the lobster in itself was disappointing. I found the taste to be mediocre, bland and ultimately disappointing."
4,Not Bad...Does its job,This is not a liquid but a powder form in a 12 oz Jar. Psillium husks are ground more fine than the original colon cleanse. Flavor ok (it tastes like pineapple) Surprised that it was 26 calories per two teaspoon serving versus 0 calories in the original. Does its job though and promotes regularity.
2,"Recommended by my doctor, but I would not!","This product was recommended by my doctor, but it is not what he said it would be. I am very disappointed in it."
4,fast and quick,"this product works great, fast, gentle, and easy. It is very think and would suggest drinking it with orange juice becuase even after many stirs this stuff simply doesnt dissolve. This product along with excercise has also assisted me in weight loss."
4,"Its good for you, but not fun to choke down...","This is a good product, but it takes a little getting used to...I bought the orange flavor, it tastes like watered down orange coolade that has pulp in it. I'd suggest mixing it with orange juice that doesnt already have pulp, because when you add this to it, it will seem like orange juice with lots of pulp. Anyway, its really good for you, and the price was decent."
5,This Stuff Works.,"If you need more fiber in your diet, this is a great product. It is psyllium husk, pure and simple, with about zero calories. I mix it into a smoothie with almond milk and a banana. Also, the price is excellent if you compare what this stuff costs at a health food store. I have used this product for years and highly recommend it."
2,Misleading advertising,"We purchased this software for our daughters, ages 5 and 9, after enjoying the books. While the content is great, we were extremely disappointed that once you finish the game and exit the mansion that's it. The label on the package states "" multi-leveled games encourage replayability"". We assumed that meant when you completed the game you could begin again with new clues. WRONG! For thirty dollars I expect my child to be able to use the software again."
5,Clever,"My 7 year old daughter absolutely loves this. The game asks the child to type their name in the beginning to ""sign in,"" and then the name appears incorporated in the graphics throughout the game. As my daughter is a beginning reader, we both appreciate the feature that ""reads"" the list of items to be found aloud. I would recommend this game as a quiet alternative to the loud, intense-motion titles that abound."
4,"Nice Game, support issues on some Macs.","We have both ""I Spy Fantasy"" and ""I Spy Spooky Mansion"" and the kids like both of them. I have run them an iMac (video chip: Radeon X1600), and MacBook (video: GMA 950 chipset), 2 MacMinis (GMA 950) and am TRYING TO RUN IT on a recent MacBook (video: GMA X3100). All systems are Intel Core 2 Duo's running Leopard. The problem seems to be with the current version of Leopard 10.5.4 and the X3100 does not support the ""thousands of colors"" option that this game will require. Until Apple corrects this problem with the driver, I don't think this game will work with the current generation of MacBooks or MacAir notebooks.I bought a new MacBook last week for my daughter to use and she really wants to run the ""I Spy"" games. Since I can't get them to run, I may have to return this notebook until Apple corrects the problem.But if you have the right hardware, I highly recommend these games. They keep our kids (ages 4 - 11) busy."
2,Play it once and that's it - you're finished.,"Based on the reviews here, I purchased this game for my 7 year old for Christmas. She got through it in a few hours and that's it. Finished. No more levels to play, nothing new to do. I won't purchase another ""I Spy"" game."
2,treat it as an I Spy book,I brought this for my children when they were keen on I spy books and was disappointed to find the lack of replayability.They all joined in with locating the clues and enjoyed seeing there name through out the puzzles. I also enjoyed the game.The disapointment was that when the game was completed that was it. There are only two riddles for each room and you get both when you play. The hidden message is always the same. The only part they play for now is making the ghosts.The only time the game sees the light of day is when we have visiting children. Mine almost never ask for it now.Treat it as you would one of the books. If your children enjoy the books and read them again and again never tiring of reading the same riddles and finding the same items then you may get value for money.
4,From Hotel California to the Sunset Grill,"In 1976, Don Henley and his fellow Eagles commented on the world in general and the Californian life style in particular from their own Hotel California. 8 years later, on this his second solo album, Don Henley still writes thoughtful poetry, set to beautiful music by Henley himself, anlong with veterans Daniel Kortchmar, J.D. Souther, Benmont Tench and others. ""Building The Perfect Beast"" is a great rock album with a wonderful mixture of good ol' lost-love-ballads (""You're Not Drinking Enough"") and Henley's sardonic and sometimes bitter-sweet comments about the American way of life (""A Month Of Sundays""). A wonderful album, plain and simple."
3,Mix of excellent and not-so-great.,"This album has his best work on it, the 3 big hits certainly testify to that. They are superbly written and arranged. Some of the other songs, like You Cant Make Love, are well written, but sound pretty schlocky. The others are just plain bad. Lots of filler on this album, I'd go with the greatest hits collection instead."
3,Not favourite but its OK.,"I bought it because I love ""Boys of the summer"". Thats all. Others songs are good but to be honest it is not kind of music that I like. So if You like rock, whatever it means, you are gonna enjoy it."
4,The Boys of Summer Is Timeless,"While ""The Boys of Summer"" was ahead of its time, it's a great soft rock album with excessively propelling songs that drive you."
3,Building the Perfect Beast by Don Henley,"Building the Perfect Beast by Don Henley. Don Henley has done a fair albumn in Building the Perfect Beast. Not Perfect but some good cuts like, Boys of Summer, All she wants to do is Dance and Sunset Grill. Classic cuts. Don is probably the main Talent of The Eagles, which is all talent."
5,Outstanding remastering of a classic album!,"This album has always in my opinion been Don Henley's best work ever. But for years I was disappointed in the poor sound quality of this album on CD. Finally, we get a 24-bit remastered version of the classic album and it sounds leaps and bounds better than the unremastered version. All of the tracks have a vastly improved sound but it's the remastered version of ""Boys Of Summer"" and ""Sunset Grill"" that blows me away. If you like Don Henley's music you'll want to pick up this one!"
4,Interesting....,"While some readers may be momentarily thrown off by Knight's fresh comedic writing style, others will see it as a way to keep the reader engaged in a subject that can be brutally tedious.What he excels at is creating a forum for intellectual exploration. His insights are delivered with a dash of irony and a cup of unrestrained humor. Never one to pass up the opportunity for a one-liner, Knight does however, get to the point.What Knight could do better would be to deliver the meat of his mathematical thesis in a less overbearing fashion. The mathematically challenged may find the later chapters a bit tough. The logic portion outlining Knights belief in an afterlife needed deeper explanation.All-in-all though, the book was well worth reading and I highly recommend it."
2,Logic falls apart at p. 70 (out of 301),"As a ""card-carrying"" agnostic, I was drawn in by the title...unfortunately, this is the best part of this book.I found the first chapter (an hysterical diatribe against Christianity) very entertaining, and was intrigued by the author's promises of formal, logical arguments to support his proofs r.e. afterlife, time travel, etc.. In lieu of this logic, Mr. Knight's proofs rely on nonsensical statements and circular logic. In an apparent effort to hide his flawed reasoning, he fills the book with obviously logical statements and belabors the logic behind them.The math is clearly intended to intimidate readers into accepting his points. Its misuse is analogous to the Christian misuse of the threat of hell to intimidate prospective Christians into accepting the Bible.I'm not saying that you should not buy this book. If you are looking for a well-reasoned treatise against Christianity, THIS IS NOT IT!"
3,Interesting and entertaining,"The writing, witty and fun, carries the reader through a variety of different arguments and proofs. Though the style is a bit sarcastic, I get a sense that Mr. Knight wants us to enjoy the read and think of life in a new way. Despite the entertaining qualities and well discussed thoughts, some aspects were perhaps just out-of-place rants against Christianity. The book would do well to maybe drop these attacks and approach religion/philosophy in a more mature, more intellectual view. I enjoyed Mr. Knight's reasoning and his fun examples. Drawing on knowledge of physics and philsophy, he presents some very significant new arguments concerning the physical as well as spiritual world. I'd like to see more from this author."
2,"Poorly argued views, faulty reasoning","Let me just say first of all, I'm an atheist. I wasn't offended by the views of the author or anything. But some of his statements just don't hold water.For example, he claims that the belief in Hell is necessary to Christianity. That's not true. It's possible to not believe in Hell and still be a Christian. Also, I couldn't go any farther after reading his argument for the existence of an afterlife. It was terrible -- it might convince a three year old. He also manages to muddle up the difference between knowing that something happened, and whether it actually happened or not.If you want to read some poorly structured, informally written, and terribly argued material, this book is for you. If you want to read arguments that you can believe, go elsewhere.On the plus side, I will say that his impassioned comdemnation of campus preachers was somewhat moving."
2,I'd sooner go to church than reread this nonsense!,"First off, I despise Christianity and rather enjoyed the ranting first chapter even though it doesn't present any arguments I didn't think of before puberty. After that it goes downhill fast. The author's arrogance is amusing here but quickly grows annoying. He tries to appear intelligent and well-educated but is betrayed by his repeated use of the word ""irregardless"". The so-called proof of the existence of an afterlife in the second chapter is laughable. Maybe one could make a game of spotting flaws in the arguments throughout the rest of the book.Faulty reasoning aside, the exposition is mediocre and the ideas presented are nothing new. Surely there are better books on this topic."
4,Good Book,"I don't know why the first dude gave it 1-star. This is a nice little ""guide"" book on treatment planning. It's not in depth because the very nature of planning a treatment is unique and not completely standardized. How can you write a book to prepare the reader for a thousand different possibilities? You can't. The flowcharts were good, but it's acknowledged that you don't have to follow the directions step by step in real life. Also, I must comment on the readability of the text. It's simple to read and understand, which in my opinion is hard to achieve in an educational book. The only thing I would complain is that the author seems to focus a lot more on perio than the other fields (endo, ortho, surgery, etc). Still, I'd recommend it as a handy GUIDE for dental students."
1,Not a very enlightening or helpful book,The entire book was full of flow charts(very gradeschool)by which one gleaned little information.
3,All-clad SS three quart saucepan.,"Cooks well, heats water well. Bought All-clad for my wife who likes it. I find the handles about two inches too long and I don't care for the little handle opposite the long handle. The long handles cause some storage issues in the slide out drawers we store them in. Not being the type to move cooked food to fancy dishes, the long handles are a bit awkward on the dining table, too.It does work well on our ceramic stovetop though I notice it is not entirely flat on the bottom. However, it sits much better than our old Revereware pots which rocked badly when hot."
4,Great read,"This story really touched my heart,and held me spellbound.I lived the story with Sophie,and related to her family.My goodness, the family were certainly hard work.Both families, in fact, were so manipulative,I am surprised that Sophia coped as well as she did.The Italian country side was so real,and the characters finely drawn.I loved this book and will keep it in my collection.I can hear all the beautiful music in my mind when I think of this book,so thank you Eileen Ramsay."
5,Isis Treasure Box,"The detail was beautiful, and it looks even better then the picture on the web. Its a wonderful present for someone who is very interested in Egypt."
4,An Excellent Piece,"An excellent piece, well designed and executed, although a bit smaller than I would have liked. A very good buy for the money. I use it as a decorative piece to store laundry change."
2,Poor Materials,"First think No one describe how big this is I wanted a bigger item.Dimension:It is only about 6 inches tall, 6 inches long, and 3 inches wide.Material:The item TOP is a different material from bottom.The Bottom is some metal, The Top is mixed with plastic the figures at top plastic.Problems:I took mine out the box one WING immediately SNAPPED off.The typical design construction is to cut slits for wings where they meet the top then super glue it sinceit is plastic, on mine they didn't put enough glue on it so it instantly snapped as I opened the box up.I will have to super glue it to fix.Description:I call this a jewelry box over ""Treasure box"" because it is more descriptive in it'ssmall size."
5,Cooks and looks great.,"It makes a sweet inexpensive gift for the family cook or for yourself. It has a beautiful finish, it looks expensive and it makes a terrific small omlette. If you need a pan this size, the decision to purchase is a no brainer."
1,"7"" pan is NOT what it should be!","I cook with All-Clad's best stainless cookware. This 7"" fry pan is not the same as those made in the USA: it does NOT have the unbelievably smooth mirror finish on the interior surface that contributes to All-Clad's great reputation. It is a cheaper version made in China with an uneven graded interior cook surface. Please be aware before you decide to buy."
3,pretty good,"pretty good but you have to remember to add the oil first and then heat up the pan for a minute or so--not heat up the pan and then add the oil. If you don't, it makes brown stains that require scrubbing--bummer. My wife also said it took a longer time to cook than when she uses a thinner cheaper non-stick pan."
1,all-clad stainless 7 inch fry pan,The handle is poorly designed. It is semi-circular with the edges facing up. It is uncomfortable to hold and we would never use it for that reason. That design on such a small handle doesn't work for us.
2,What's it for?,"This pan is really too small to be useful. And the reviews are right, eggs are a disaster in this pan with or without non-stick spray. It's cute, but I wish I had purchased a larger, or less stickier pan."
3,Deja vu,"While I enjoyed reading a fresh take on the world of Sherlock Holmes, with Joseph Bell mentoring Doyle, instead of a rearanging of the bones of our beloved canon, this book gives me deja vu. Bell and Doyle end up investigating cases that fall along parallel lines to the canon, such as waiting for a bicylist on a desterted stretch of road which shouted ""Solitary Cyclist!!!"" in my ears.Hmm...a different take but not entirely new."
5,THE BEST,Everyone who loves a good Sherlock Holmes mystery MUST read this book! This is the difinative fictional book on the Master's creator.
4,"Short in duration, but ominously powerful","""Chrysalis,"" the final episode of the first season of Babylon 5, was the first indication of what the show would become in terms of its suspenseful plotting, and composer Christopher Franke rolled out some of his best tunes of that first year to accompany the episode's rising jeopardy. ""Chrysalis"" features not only some dark and menacing cues, but an actual song with vocals (""Believe Me Now,"" heard in the background of a bar scene in which Garibaldi questions a suspect) and a brief excerpt borrowed from Franke's solo CD ""Klemania"" (heard at a New Year party scene). The one catch is that the CD weighs in at just a little over 20 minutes - but what music is there leaves a lasting impression."
1,"Classic Album, Terrible Re-Master.","The songs on this remastered edition are actually clipping (Distorting). This is especially apparent on the 2 bonus tracks ""Hong Kong Garden"" and ""Staircase Mystery"" which are in fact 2dB louder than the 10 other tracks. I want to ask the mastering engineer - What were you thinking? I ripped the CD and opened up ""Staircase Mystery"" with Sony Soundforge and you can see the damage. All the peaks have been trimmed off. Terrible. If you are going to re-master an album, the sound on the newer edition should be as good, or better than the original. I suggest getting the older 1992 CD edition."
1,Inexcusable sound,"The ""remastering"" job for this wonderful record is an absolute joke. Distortion runs rampant throughout it, and the label should be offering replacements, or out and out refunds. Avoid this reissue at all costs, but one of the other versions. A crying shame, really."
1,Re-mastering problems,"As other reviews have suggested, the re-mastering here was seriously screwed up. I have the second album, 'Join Hands', from the same series of reissues and it sounds fine, which only makes the problem with this record all the more inexcusable. Where're the refunds?"
4,a good release,"siouxsie's first album was very good when i first heard it in 1997 and it hasn't left my cd player yet! (except for listening to join hands,kaleidioscope,juju,etc.) it is a really big influence on me and my band. we actually did covers of carcass,and nicotine stain. we are also doing a cover of metal postcard. i suggest you get this but first get the single compilations and kaliedioscope,and juju. ten after you buy this, buy join hands."
3,"Good album, not my favorite Banshees","It's fun to listen to. The younger Siouxsie Sioux seems to hiccup into the microphone at times, haha. Carcass is my favorite song. I also like Jigsaw Feelings and Overground. Really good."
1,Complete waste of money,I bought this thinking that I would get some inciteful thinking but all this article does is provide short quotes from 20 existing COOs describing the different roles of a COO. Not enough detail to be any real help.
2,Not much help,Not much help. My son's head got no support from this.Though it did provide some extra cushioning
5,The Music Biz,"Great insight into the world of music publishing. It was a very, very helpfull text for me...as a songwriter to get a clear understanding as to how it all works. Thanks Randy!"
4,Solid overview of the publishing business,"I have read several books on music publishing, and this is one of the best and most recent ones. What I particularly like about this book is that it is short, concise and easy to read. There's not a whole lot of legalese in here, just enough that is necessary for each topic. It's in plain english, so it's fairly easy to understand. It's also modern to the extent it addresses digital issues. Overall, a good buy."
5,Fun and entertaining,"My 10 month old likes to open the Velcro that keeps the book closed. There are some parts that hecan lift and move which he loves. The dragonfly ""wings"" are his favorite to chew on. They seemed to be sewn on very well so I don't think they will come apart. Fun bookend cute rhyming story. The back of the book has each insect on the back."
2,Problems with the beetle wings,"My daughter loves this book. Unfortunately, the silver paint on the blue beetle wings is starting to rub off. None of the other pages have problems so its fixable, but in a product like this its unacceptable."
1,FADES EXCESSIVELY,"I just bought this book and I washed it before giving it to my baby. I washed it with other cloth books like the Lamaze peekaboo forest and all the other books are fine, but this one is extremely faded after one wash with extra mild detergent? I am very dissappointed with the quality."
4,pleased with purchase,very good quality and am pleased with purchase. some colors are too dark but over all very nice.different textures are nice.
4,cute & colorful book,"I bought this book for my 3 month old. He couldn't wait to play with it when he saw me take it out of the box & clean it. It crinkles which babys love & has lots of bright sounds & textures. It says to wipe with a cloth to clean, but I've put in the washing machine on gentle cycle with no problems. He still enjoys playing with it 2 months later."
5,Wonderful Book!,"This is a great interactive book for our 5 month old. He loves to look at the bright colors, and I love that it is so well written. I'm tired of baby books with out words! This one keeps both my babies and my attention."
4,Misleading title,"You may be surprised to find that Fuzzy Bee is not actually *in* this book at all. Perhaps, having made the cover, he had nothing further to contribute to the plot."
1,Fuzzy Bee and Friends,The first time my daughter played with this book she bit a hole in the plastic which covers the snail. The thin plastic -- akin to saran wrap -- came off with a little pulling. I think it presents a serious choking hazard; I am returning the book.
1,Received the shorter version,"As some other 1-star reviewers pointed out, the book you get is not the one featured under ""search inside this book"". This one contains only six characters, not eight (see my uploaded customer image). Feeling deceived!"
2,Do not wash!,"So I read all the reviews before buying the book and felt that I could wash this in the washer/dryer. We have a front loader one and I put in a laundry bag to make it 'extra safe'... I wanted to wash it before giving to our daughter since she loves putting these in her mouth... well it's now all crumpled and has dull lifeless colors. I try to get her to enjoy it but to no avail. If you get this my advice is to not wash in the washer. (Versus her ""taggie"" books like ""Princess"", we can wash and dry w/no worries, they just get softer and more fun to suck on!)"
4,Good Soft Book,My baby loves this book. She especially loves the dragonfly wings and chatters to the bugs all the time.
5,Wasn't Disappointed,"I bought this based on customer reviews. I was not disappointed. Easy to handle, interesting to look at, and different textures are great for learning and keeping interest of very young children."
5,My 4 month old loves it,We love the crunchy sounds it makes and all the fun feely bugs that fascinate my daughter! Really too cute!!!
2,Ridiculous price!,"Good information but hardly in depth. Router Basics is more than ""basic""...it amounts to information on how to change passwords and interface states. The TCP/IP and RIP section only has one lab configuring only RIP on one router.For $150 I expected MUCH more material, more labs (maybe even a ""topology creator""), and more testing. I would ask for a way to bookmark my progress but there is so little that I had no problem keeping track of where I was."
1,Save you money,Save your money. This was the first resource I purchased from cisco and I am very disappoint. This program has more bugs then most beta software. The movies do not even work.
4,better than good,"It's a real good tool for the beginners, it takes you step by step into the router enviroment and introduce the TCP/IP concepts and networks very well.It is a helpfully tool if you want to try a router before touch a real one, that was my case and it really worked but it is not a full simulated router, because it has limited commands just for the labs, but it is enough the prepare you for a real encounter.I'm not full english speaker but the voice instructions are excellent. Now i'll try the next step:CIM Routing IP Distance-Vector Protocols."
3,better than good,"It's a real good tool for the beginners...i insist beginners, it takes you step by step into the router enviroment and introduce the TCP/IP concepts and networks very well.It is a helpfully tool if you want to try a router before touch a real one, that was my case and it really worked but it is not a full simulated router...i repeat it is not a full simulated router, because it has limited commands just for the labs, then you can not resolve real toubles with it...that's what cisco doesn't tell you.The TCP/IP section is not enough, but it is enough the prepare you for a real encounter.I'm not full english speaker but the voice instructions are excellent.I think this CIM is a good simulated router in the market, but it is too expensive. I'm preparing for the CCNA and it Worked for me just for the beginning, If you don't have any router the practice then It is a good and maybe the only one to try."
1,"Do not buy this item, it is not as advertised","I emailed Big Fly Sports, the seller of this item and asked if this was truly the Price per Dozen"" as advertised. They told me that Amazon fulfills this order so they couldn't answer my question.I ordered and received ONE vest, not 12. I figured this was a bunch of crap, but since they said it was a dozen, I figured Amazon would hold true on the written description.Amazon assured me they could refund my money, but since they do not fulfill this item, they could not send me the other 11 vests.Big Fly Sports will rip you off, do NOT order these, go elsewhere. You can get these vests MUCH cheaper elsewhere, $2 - $4 each. This ONE vest, in the end will cost you $13."
3,"Not great, but still usable","There are some great things, and things which seem poor in the design of this running water belt. If the water bottles were easier to get in and out without wasting energy or changing your balance during the run it would be a much better product.Pros:Fits well on the waist and doesn't bounce around.Has nice pocket spaces which can carry a variety of items.Bottle sizes are very good.The bottles balance very nicely on the waist.The location sits in a good position which stays out of the arms way when running.Cons:Water bottles are hard to take out or put into the slots, especially when running which wastes energy.The water bottles are of low quality and if squeezed fast will squirt water from the sides.Water bottles look as though they won't have a long life span.Two hands are required to put the water bottles in place, or take out."
4,fast delivery,"fast delivery,right product,return reciept included in box (which I NEVER received with ANY other product I ever purchased through any OTHER amazon retailer)I purchased this item for my son who is doing a lot of running to get into shape (PT) before entering boot camp for the U.S. Marine Corps he orginally wanted the backpack but after reading up on those and the issues with keeping them from molding We decided this product might be a better and more logical choice for him. He has since worn this and uses this product every day since and loves it just wishes the bottles held more water, being their runs are usually fairly long the water doesnt last quite long enough especially on very hot days."
4,Functional and quality,"Running with it for a few weeks- one of the bottles broke, but aside from that it is exactly what I expected it to be. Functional and of good quality (aside form the one defective bottle) - the pouch is just barely big enough for my iPhone, but it fits!"
3,How can I purchase if I cant select a size?,"This is a great product at a great price, but the Amazon page doesn't give me an option of selecting which size I want. So how do I buy one?"
2,Not quite perfect,"This was exactly what I wanted until I tried it on. The two bottles on the sides were located such that as my arms swung while walking/jogging, the rubbed against the bottles - that just wouldn't work for me. I did like the 2 pockets rather than the one large pocket, but this would have been better if the pockets were adjustable so they could have been slid a bit closer to the body's midline and away from my arm swing."
4,Glad I purchased it!,"After reading many reviews of this and other water belt type products, I chose this FuelBelt Trail Runner 4 Bottle Belt. I have used it 3 times thus far and have found it to be a very satisfying purchase. I would agree with others in that there is no way you'd be able to master removing a bottle while in full running motion. However, in training with my running group friends, it is not a problem to stop or slow down enough for a drink. As I marathon train through the summer months, this will be an invaluable piece of training equipment. When full, I do not feel that it weighs too much or changes my stride at all. I wear it lower than my waist, more on my hips and quite snug. It has not had a slipping or loosening problem yet. Again, I am very satisfied with the purchase, especially for the price!"
5,Great item!!!,"I have been running for some time now. The far I run the more water I need to carry, I got tired of carrying a water bottle in my hand. I used a Camelbak, they are good but the fuel belt is great because of the pocket and the ability to have water and Gatorade. A great buy!!"
4,provocative exploration: compares and contrasts,"This book is not afraid to ask the tough questions, or make the tough comparisons. For this reason, it may make many uncomfortable. It bucks the the modern trend to over-pursue the appearance of ""avoiding being judgemental"" and so avoids the common pitfall of bland assertions. My first encounter with it was in the context of a discussion group, and things got quite heated. The large format of the book lends itself well to writing notes in the margins. As others have mentioned, the bibliography has many good pointers."
4,Cute idea,My granddaughter didn't love this item but for children who like dolls and changing clothes it is really cute. Great to take on trips.
3,Not a professional production,"I was very excited to receive this DVD. I have been a fan of the CB for years and have seen them in concert several times. The DVD has 3 sections. For some reason, my DVD player will not navigate the main menu to the 2nd and 3rd section, so I can only view the first, which is the most recent (The Amazing Brass section.) While the perfomance is superb, the video and sound are not very good. The video looks like it was done by someone's mom sitting in the 10th row with a cheap camcorder. The sound is OK, but certainly not up to what you would expect from a $20 DVD. Every time they talk into the microphone, you have to turn the volume down. And they seem to have miked the audience as much as the CB. The editing is very poor, with bad transitions from one tune to the next. They just sort of stop and start.If I ever manage to watch the 2nd and third parts, I hope that they are much better."
4,Good purchase,I purchased this DVD for a family member who is a big fan of CB. The video quality does sometimes look like a home movie and the sound of the recording is off. But if you are a fan of this band I can't see those things really bothering you too much. The DVD is still enjoyable to watch and I was not distracted when I watched it.The main issues with the recording are that you must increase/decrease the volume on your system between songs. Once they start playing you can leave it alone. Many of the songs are pretty long so it's really no big deal.
2,Good picture quality but a mediocre product,"The good news is that the picture quality is very good, which gave me high hopes when the first song started playing. Sadly the changing focus destroys the ""virtual fireplace"" illusion and the remaining songs are nothing spectacular. Kind of deceptive really, that it starts out with a nice vocal performance by Ray Charles and the rest of the songs are totally uninspired anonymous instrumentals. I enjoy instrumentals, but these were bland - and so many of them (especially after that dynamic lead-in) made for a really boring experience."
2,Home movie quality,"This video's footage was not up to my expected quality. The lighting was off, the picture quality was not up to expectations. There were also some weird camera zoom-ins on the fire grate/log that didn't make sense."
4,very nice,this has a great picture on it and it is worth the money. the music is a great selection on this dvd.
4,Wonderful,"I love the DVD. It's great to watch a fire since I don't have a fireplace. I wish that the image was further away at all times, however, my husband liked that it changed it up. But I dont want to stare at a fire up close. The music is great. But i would have liked a bit more updated music. But it's still wonderful nonetheless!!!"
5,Good Quality,"I was concerned that this wouldn't be up to hi-def standards and was pleasantly suprised. The 1080i video is very good, the 5.1 Dolby TrueHD music is very good, and even the crackling of the fireplace is very good. The fireplace is so realistic that my kids and I found that we experience a strange warm sensation when we walk by the lcd tv. Go figure..."
1,not a great virtual fireplace,"i was not impressed with how the focus kept changing: i wanted a virtual fireplace on my TV. if the focus moves in and out and has weird close ups, the whole ""suspension of disbelief"" factor is shot."
1,Yule Log Review,"I purchased this as a gift for someone for Christmas. I had seen one at a friends house and loved it. However, this version is not as nice or realistic. I am extremely disappointed with the purchase. The video zooms in and out as you are watching it. The fire is constantly changing, and the image is so close you can not see the entire fire. The idea is to imagine your TV as a fireplace but this constant movement does not allow that to happen! It is poorly constructed!"
1,Very disappointing,"This has to be THE worst Michael Bay film I've ever seen. The pacing and camerawork was just god-awful. And the special effects? Don't even get me started.My recommendation, save your money and go watch something that's actually worth watching. Like Hackers."
3,distracted by shapes,"This is a decent enough product for the type. There is a wide selection of seasonal music which can either be played with the video, or left off with just the sounds of the fire (my preference for the most part). Too bad they couldn't have included Christmas Wrapping by the Waitresses in the group. My only problem with the whole thing was a (for me) very distracting log which looks for all the world like a large snake burning front and center in the video ""slideshow"". Having a pet snake of my own that prevented the 4 or 5 stars."
1,Disappointed,"Charm was nice but expected a charm with a loop with which to sew onto a Christmas Stocking,not a sliding charm. Too expensive both for charm and shipping. Came late, I accepted it back and just passed it around in case somebody could find a use for it...no idea whatever happened to it."
5,A great novel about surviving.,The author is a very talented writer. I am not just saying that because I know him. The book made me think about surviving in war and how hard it must have been to be in war
5,My favorite Siouxie album of all time.,"Every single song on this album is beautiful. This is one of those albums that you will buy over and over, no matter how many times you lose track of it. Goosebumps guaranteed!"
4,siouxsie takes darkness and glamour to the fair,"the least favourite album of Severin's, yet one of my favourites. From the five fathoms of ""belladonna"" to the blood matted mane in ""Pointing Bone"" we find some of sioux and severin's most challenging lyrics and twists. this is the most magical album by the Banshees whilst retaining the dark side of their fervor. And as every reviewer seems to include, this is the second event in which Robert Smith appears (1st touring during Join Hands). The mixture fortells the perfect recipe for a fine album. ""Take Me Back"" fortifies perfect liberation from confounded confusion while ""We Hunger"" sinks its teeth into something untold. This album reveals more and more every listening experience (and I have had it since 1987 when I discovered the Banshees). Hyaena is truly a landmark in their recording career and a must for the curious and the collector!"
2,Good condition???? Fair at best....,"This book arrived promptly. I was very dissatisfied with the condition on this book. It was listed as ""Good Condition"" it was ""Fair Condition"" at best. There was extensive underlining, highlighting and writing in the margins. I immediately emailed this sell (mid March) and have yet to get a response. This seller was not the lowest price, I chose them due to their geographic location for quick shipping. I will not use this seller again."
1,Scare Mongering Nonsense,"This book could have been an enlightening look on the legalities and challenges of the legal fabric worldwide in regards to both reproductive and cloning technology - which, despite the mistaken combining of the two within this book, are not the same thing.Instead, the book reads like the 10 year old's nightmare the author claims does not dictate public policy. Her lack of understanding of differing cultural values demeans any pretense she has at being an expert.Avoid, unless you support the future of biosciences and want to know your ""frenemy.""If I could give it 0 stars, I would."
1,Anyone Could've Written This Book - too bad!,"I am a medical student and a law student. We read this book in a 1-week special course and I was very disappointed. Every case from the newspapers and talk shows is in here, but with no legal or medical insight: it's all ""Tsk, tsk"" and ""please ban."" A high school kid could've written."
1,Not what I expected - too bad!,"You might think that a law professor and female bioethicist would share some legal insights and be sympathetic to infertile women, but Prof. Andrews is neither. Did she right this book too fast for the money? To cash in on news about cloning? Appears so. She has nothing much to say."
5,Scary and Shocking,"This book not only was an eye opener, but it made me mad. I can't believe people (researchers) would be so selfish and money hungry that they would jepordize the lives of women and unborn children. It reminds me of what Hitler wanted to do- selective breeding.I do think couples who can't have children be afforded the opportunity to have kids- but do they really know what they are getting into with IVF and genetically engineered children.This book is a must read so that you know what is going on in the name of science. Ms Andrews- a lawyer discusses legal aspects, ethical issues and medical exploitation. A very easy read.Do you know what your doctor's are doing to you?"
5,New CD from Sawyer Brown a Fine Effort,"Mission Temple Fireworks Stand, the new CD from Sawyer Brown, is a fine collection of new music from the veteran group. It features several up-tempo country rock songs, including Mission Temple, Tarzan and Jane, and a blistering remake of Keep Your Hands to Yourself. Another key song is the heart-renching ballad They Don't Understand.I think this is their best CD since Six Days on the Road. There isn't really a weak song, and the band sounds very tight throughout. I'll be playing this one a lot."
5,SAWYER BROWN MISSION TEMPLE,"If you are a SAWYER BROWN fan or just a general Country Music fan, you will love this album. There is everything from high tempo to ballads, and the song ""They Don't Understand"" is the best song I have ever heard about day-to-day life (and what is important). The Boys are back!"
2,Basic Dental Health,The video was poorly made. It was made for elementary students and not suitable for showing dental assisting students. I had hoped it would have been good for my students.
3,The history of science and technology,I thought it was going to be a written history of science and technolgy in story form but it was a short snippits of science and technology in chronological form. I wanted background.judge 1950
3,Excitement for the coder.,"This book is designed in an easy-to-follow approach that programmers or student can follow. It is not for non-programmer, it is for the IT professional or computer programmer. If you are familiar with the programming world this book will add excitement to your life of code."
1,Poor example of 7th grade Composition!,"This book breaks every rule of Composition that my 7th Grade English teacher taught me. Not only are you exposed to singular subjects with plural verbs, but sentence structures throughout the book are poor.The book makes reference to a CD that is supposed to accompany the book, but is not furnished.The author immerses the reader in computer jargon from the Introduction on to the end of the book. This, notwithstanding the implication that the audience is expected to include non-programmers. The non-programmer will need Pepcid before going very far into the book.Save your money. Your dissatisfaction with this writing is guaranteed or your money back!"
5,Genetically Engineered food: A survivors guide,"This book educates us in what the food industry seems to be trying so hard to hide. I want desperately to know what I put into my body and that seems harder and harder to find out. I don't like the idea of the cycle of life and the natural food chain being altered. That is what this book tells us about. The fda seems to want us not to know. The fact is we don't know how this manufactured, genetically changed food is going to effect us and before we start irreversable damage we better know what it is we are doing. Cause and effect. Read the book."
1,Science Fiction!,"This book never lets a good fact get in the way of putting together a good scare story-- in other words, this book is an entertaining piece of science fiction. Few if any of the views in this book are shared by main-stream scientists, thousands of which have endorsed genetically engineeredfood, because the available data do not support any of the charges made in thisbook."
5,Practical help for cooks and food lovers,"This is the perfect book for cooks and food lovers! The authors describe why we should avoid genetically engineered food, how we can identify genetically engineered food in our supermarkets, and where to find safe organic alternatives. A great holiday gift for your favorite chef!"
4,Inspiring and thought provoking,"I heard about this book while exploring home schooling on the internet. Sounded interesting so I ordered it. It is a great read with lots of ideas and challenges the way we normally view education. It has definitely left me thinking about our education system and all the issues there are such as bullying and children that are stressed. Also the amount of drug taking and problems with teenagers and their self esteem and then going off the rails. I feel if they were given more freedom to learn in their own ways and more quality time with individuals to teach them there may perhaps be many more well adjusted young people. We also want them to grow up too quick and heap more and more on their shoulders, I think they need time to dream and plan their own lives."
4,The teenage liberation handbook. . .,". . . is a good discussion of ""unschooling,"" the philosophy that children and teens should take control of their own education. It was sufficiently in-depth in its handling of various topics to make it a good manual for teens who are interested. I would have given this book 5 stars but the author is very biased in her political views and this shows through in the book."
2,Comments on The Teenage Liberation Handbook,"This book contains many excellent ideas about self-education, and would be beneficial to the outside-of-school life of a traditional high school student, as well as to an unschooler.However, this book frequently tells the reader that their problems are not their own fault. Everyone likes to hear that, but it can't possibly be completely true. The writing is frequently, and unnecessarily, bitter and mean-spirited.Much of the book is unnecessarily devoted to criticizing traditional school. In any work of fiction, the protagonist appears stronger with the presence of a strong antagonist, but the author presents unschooling as the alternative to something undesirable and intolerable. She also ignores the group of potential unschoolers who are happy with school and/or succeed in that environment. Unschooling is not just for those who hate school."
5,Excellent!! Truly Excellent!!,I love this book! I unschool my two children - ages 14 & 11. The author has fabulous ideas and speaks in a voice that rings true at my house! I have read many sections aloud to the kids and have seen both of them reading bits and pieces themselves. The Teenage Liberation Handbook is inspiring and life affirming -- I highly recommend it!
5,Quit school and learn,"This book clearly shows the evils of compulsory education, and inspired me to drop out of school and travel my own path."
5,great way to get started,"Grace's book first appeared on the scene in 1991. A revised edition came out in 1998. I have every edition of this book with every different cover. I often buy it just to give it away.It shows many ways to design an unschooling curriculum. Grace correctly believes that people learn best by just experiencing and loving life. She also believes that this leads to more well-rounded life. She largely explains this in her chapter on the ""glorious generalist."""
5,"liberating in the best sense of the word, to kids & parents","Makes you wonder why you never came to these conclusions before, if you really wanted to see an ""educated"" public, hence a happy, common sensed, and open, public. It reaffirms what Jefferson and Locke and Aristotle saw in ""Freedom"" as the ultimate goal in personal and public happiness."
5,I love this book. Should be required reading for all teens.,"This book helped me realize there was nothing wrong with me for hating school so much, even though I had been labeled an ""intelligent child,"" and that all the damage done from it could be avoided. I am still stuck miserablly in school, but with a greater understanding and a stong will to convince my parents to let me out. I'm in the process of buying it for almost every person I know, adults with children and kids alike, to save them as much pain and valuable learning time as possible. A must read for anyone who would like a ""real life"" and education."
5,Everyone who has ever been to school should read this book,"The Teenage Liberation Handbook is a book that all teenagers should read when considering their educational prospects. This book encompasses all of the educational philosophies that support unschooling while examining the reasons why school doesn't work in a concise, quick read. If you are considering unschooling this is defintely a book you would want have by your side. An awesome book."
5,Solid Clear Through,"Given the already excellent reviews, I only feel the need to give this book 5 stars and to add that the Table of Contents can give you an idea of what's in this book. This is a book that explain why schools often do more harm than good, why unschooling works so well, and how to do it legally and effectively. If you don't have any idea how to unschool in math, science, or any other subject, this book will help. It advises on how to get involved in social activities and team sports, too. It even shows how to make unschooling financially rewarding. Finally, this book is a rich resource on how to gain higher education if that is your wish, or to explore other avenues of continued learning.All in all, whatever problem you can think of with unschooling, Miss Llewellyn has already thought of it and explained it in this book."
5,Mistake corrected quickly,Mistake was taken care of and proved customer service is important. I greatly appreciated thequick resolution to the problem. Thank you!
1,"weak, effeminate, lacks seriousness",I thought the author was a bit immature. I found the author's lack of seriousness to be a serious conflict to my real interest in accomplishing something in the world via educating myself. The author is a wanderer who wants to follow ever passion that comes her way.The real issue with quitting school is discipline and purpose. If you don't have a lot of both then it seems foolish and could easily end up in vain. The author does not advise caution nor does she provide a voice of reason and wisdom.
1,Strange and misleading,This book has many strange ideas and euphemisms referring to the school system. The writer comes off as a strange hippie who Turned out to be a failure in high school and is now angry at the world. If you know what is good for your kid don't by this waste of paper
5,Awesome book! I read it again and again...,"This is a great book! I was already homeschooled when I read it, and I didn't know the meaning of ""unschooled"", but when I read it, it made so much sense, learning without being taught. Everyone can read this book, not just teenagers who are angry at school. I read this again and again. It's my favorite non-fiction book. It has a lot of information, advice, and it's really fun to read, too."
5,Enchanting read,"I had always considered myself ""not a romance fan"" but, I must confess, I have been converted. This was a great book, hard to put down. I know a work of fiction is good if I find myself cheering for the fictional characters in it, as if they are real.This is the second book in a series and I especially love how it expands on a character introduced in the first.I look forward to starting the 3rd."
4,My favorite Witch,"I enjoyed the trials and spells created by Melody Seabright. Miss Seabright's stories are a fun way to pass an evening, I hope she will continue writing these most enjoyable stories."
1,Written Porn,"Looking at the discription, I naively thought it was a fun sort of book, but a just a few pages in I am bombarded with reference to sex. I tried to give it chance and I encounter more sex scenes. Not much of a plot either. I wouldn't recommend this to any of my friends."
3,Real witches?,"I have not read a book by Ms. Blair before and stopped on page 25 of this one. Jason's grandmother told him Kira is a witch, he saw her casting a spell--and immediately believes she really is a REAL witch and starts wrestling with her for her wand and grabs her breast.I found his quick acceptance of her as a real witch hard to believe. Do the two live in a place populated by witches so his recognition of her being a witch would be so easy? This stopped me cold.However, having read the other reviews, I'll keep going. I just hope the rest of the book is better motivated."
4,Witches Rule,"I purchased all 3 of these books. I love anything to do with Witches and supernatural stuff so these caught my eye while browsing. They are a fast read, but also keep your interest to see what funny things will happen next. I will recommend the series to all my friends and watch for other books by Annette Blair. I would hate to miss the laughter."
5,Will leave you with a smile,"I found myself loving this book from the first page. Jason is professional hockey player who is currently on leave due to an injury. Kira is a witch who just found her fiance in bed with her sister. The two spark and a sweet erotic story ends in a perfect fairy tale fashion. What a wonderful fun book! Check out the Annette's Accidental Witch Trilogy; 1. The Kitchen Witch (1), My Favorite Witch(2),The Scot, the Witch & the Wardrobe(3) and coming soon Annette's Triplet Witch Trilogy Sex; The Psychic Witch(1)in August 2007, What a Witch Wants (2) in February 2008 and The Lady is a Witch (3) in August 2008."
2,never again,bought this camera to keep in my purse for the just in case pictures... what a joke.. first the extended battery shows as needing to be replaced after being fully charge and just placing it in the camera- so I am forced to use the regular battery that came with it...Next- with the fourth time using the camera (of course at a special event) i try to place the battery in the camera and three pieces fall out from the door- so now i have to pay to send it and insure it to be repaired- turning out to be cheaper to buy a throw away... first and last cannon...
2,Bad red eye (redeye) problem,"This camera has a very bad red-eye problem while taking flash photographs at night.If the subject is NOT looking at the camera, they are guaranteed to get a red-eye even with red-eye reduction turned on.I had to return my camera since the problem was so severe, and its silly to have such a camera and not be able to use it for flash photos. And I dont feel up to the task of doctoring all my photos using Adobe Photoshop..."
3,A bit disappoint at this Canon digicam,"I bought this camera because I always got good impression and hear good reviews from Canon ever since the SD series came out. I was impressed with the design and the feature of this awesome camera, however, the picture quality was not up to my expectation. A tiny little shake can ruin your picture, I thought Canon fixed the problem in this camera, since this is their latest invention with a huge 2.5"" LCD.But the camera really does pack with tons of features and great functions for one to use. The pic quality was the only thing make me cut 2 stars out.If I'd to buy a camera again, I'd prob. try some other brand."
3,lovely camera except that Canon goes cheap on key parts,"The tiny plastic latch for the card/battery compartment broke almost immediately, making the camera useless. I earlier had a Model S400 Digital Elph: the plastic lid-latch to the card compartment, quite a different part design altogether, broke also. $46.75 to fix it: part $1.75, labor $45. At least I could black-tape THAT lid until it was repaired, not so the SD550.No more Digital Elves for me until Canon gets on top of this design/material flaw. Too bad. Otherwise so impressive."
3,"SD550 okay, not as wonderful as I had expected","While I love the compactness of this camera, I have two problems with it: 1) it gets very hot after about 50 consecutive photos have been taken and 2) the flash doesn't work very well in darker places. For instance, I was at a wedding and while the outside pictures were great, the church pictures were absolutely lousy. I also own the Canon G3, which would have filled the light appropriately and would never take such dark pictures in bad lighting. I was really excited about the size of the SD550, since my G3 is so bulky, but I am disappointed at its performance."
4,very fragile,"I dropped the camera from 2 feet and the metal outer rim of the lens slightly became bent and won't close. After some time spent tring to bend the metal back in place, I finally was able to close the lens.Besides that, it is an awesome camera. I am able to pick out a color (ex. red) and take a picture with that color standing out and everything else black and white. No photoshop needed."
3,eh...It's ok but my old kodak 5mp takes crisper pics,I bought this camera and not the 600 or above because of the existing viewfinder. Many compacts are no longer including this little beauty because of space issues and to of course get the largest LCD screen possible. Since I like to carry my camera with me everywhere and hate the inconvienience of changing batteries or recharging I like to conserve as much juice as possible. Using the viewfinder instead of the LCD does just that. I immediatly noticed the not so great picture quality of the Canon 550. My old and beat up Kodak dx4530 seems to take much crisper high definition shots than my new camera. I even did a side-by-side comparison and the Kodak blew the 7.1mp doors off the canon. What's the use of 7.1 mp if all you can blow up is a grainy photo.
4,Lack of Image Stabilization Has Me Looking to Replace It,"I have owned this camera for about a year. I love everything about it EXCEPT its lack of image stabilization. It is fine when I use it. I know to hold the camera still or brace it. I have never taken an unusable photo. But, if I give the camera to someone else, chances are better than half that the photo will be unusable unless I caution them to hold the camera very still. Sometimes even this doesn't help. I find myself now looking for a newer Canon with Image Stabilization."
5,Phenomenal Camera,Just returned from trip...camera was right size for sightseeing and picture resolution is excellent. I would highly recommend this camera!!
5,Canon SD550,"I just purchased this camera. I think it is great. As of today I am still learning to operate it but I have seen no red eye problem, and the color is perfect. This is my third digital camera and it is the best. For a point and shoot small camera I don't think you can beat it. Buy and enjoy"
3,Really not what I expected for the price,"I am having the same problems with the PQI Memory card as the review below... so beware. The videos I shot have a lot of static.Other issues I have -You have to not only consider the price but the extras you have to purchase with it.So far I have had to purchase a memory card, case, extra battery, and one of the LCD protectors (I purchased the Da Protector, and it seems like it was a good purchase).The camera doesnt always focus on what you want it to focus on. The pictures sometimes come out blurry. I especially have issues with blurry pictures. I think its maybe because I'm not keeping my hand as still as the camera would like. I wish it had image stabilization. I dont think the My Colors Mode is all that great. It doesnt seem to work all the time. The pictures seem to come out more blurry than in the normal modes. Most the pictures I took at a recent concert came out blurry, noisy, focused on the people in front of me..etc. Not what I expected for my $400."
