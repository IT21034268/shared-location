4,"Polished, not raw, performances. An exciting rediscovery.","I bought the original vinyl recording in the 1960s and loved it. Bernabe de Moron is a more polished guitarist than, say, Manitas de Plata, and as technically precise and clear as Juan Serrano, but with more emotion and flair. All three were leading exponents of the flamenco form during that era, but of the three I actually enjoyed Bernabe de Moron's music the most.I was devastated when my original LP recording was damaged and I tried for years to find a replacement, without success. Decades passed, then yesterday I happened to pass a Spanish restaurant featuring live flamenco players and I made a mental note to check online. I am elated to find this digitally-remastered edition of what had become, for me, a lost masterpiece."
3,max heat,"This heater works great in a house with no walls in the dead of winter. But, it will drive you out of anything saller than 3000 sq.ft. The good thing about this heater is that it heats quick enough to dry sheetrock and texture to be ready for paint in a matter of just a few hours."
4,"Moody, Atmospheric score...highly underappreciated.....","This score is definately along the same lines as Dolores Claiborne, or the quieter moments of his Mission:Impossible score. Elfman's musical palette includes mostly small string ensemble, piano and his signature wordless choir. There's also some interesting percussion sounds. If you liked the ""Betrayal"" cue from M:I, then you'll enjoy this score. The main theme from Extreme Measures is subtle but beautiful and Elfman creates variations on this theme in every cue. The suspense music is ferocious (The Descent, Elevator Madness), with blaring horns and schizophrenic string playing, but the quiet tracks are sooo subdued and achingly sad (Hard Guys, Tough News).... This score is a diamond in the rough -- worth any film music fan's attention...."
1,Disappointing,"I'd have less problem with this book if it had been listed as historical fiction rather than history. As far as a true historical account, it is neither well researched nor well documented. There are no footnotes and only a brief bibliography. Few original sources were used which resulted in numerous errors. It is an interesting story, but far more attention to historical research and accuracy would have made it a far better book, and a real history."
4,Carter Metclaf: A Story Not Taught in School,"I grew up in Alabama, heard thousands of Civil War stories, and thought that I knew all that had occurred. Then I read, North Across the River. The events that are discussed were never taught to me in school. The book is very detailed and well researched. Very few Civil War books that I have read have had the impact on me that this one did. The book does not stop at telling the story. As a reader I became emotional involved with the families and their own personal battles.If you are not a history or Civil War buff you will still find this book to grab your attention and keep it from cover to cover."
3,"Certainly better than 'Tomcat""","I've read just about all of O'Brien's work since he chronicles our generation and keeps the same themes going. July, July is much better than Tomcat...but it does not come up to In the Lake of the Woods. I had read many of the tales in July in NYer or Esquire and I really believe that these tales worked better as short stories than as tied together class reunion tales. Everyone in July has these 2-5 word pithy comebacks. Voices aren't distinct as they were in Things They Carried and Casciato. It was hard keeping everyone straight for the first half of the book because they all had the same voice when he writes reunion dialog. The novel reads quickly but nothing stays. When I read several of the stories earlier, I thought their impact was far more lasting. There's no doubt he's a clever writer. However, people of our generation with our experiences need far less clever and much more depth in understanding these experiences."
4,"I know it's not his best, but so what?","Tim O'Brien has one of the toughest jobs in the United States. He has to prove over and over what a great writer he is. After such great books like ""The Things They Carried"" and ""In the Lake of the Woods"" readers expectations are high. I thought that ""Tomcat In Love"" was a good book, but poor Tim had to get trashed by the critics because it didn't live up to his other books. Everyone in Amazon Land: PLEASE STOP THAT!!! Desist from comparisons. It really does an overall disservice.Now the book:July, July is a great piece of fiction writing. Plain and simple. Mr. O'Brien is an American icon. His dialog is funny, snappy, realistic, and yet always literary and solid. The plot is slight, but his characters are broad and real. No one writes about the details of relationships better, not to mention the intelligent manner in which he depicts the Vietnam War (or any war for that matter) experience."
5,Another Amazing Chapter in The O'Brien Odyssey,"I'm frankly astonished by the negative reviews for this novel. O'Brien has written several books that can be considered masterpieces--The Things they Carried chief among them. While many loved in the Lake of the Woods, it left me a bit cold (it was still superior). Anyway, I applaud O'Brien for continuning to try something new and different. I am not in my 50s, so I can't judge how real this book is, however, the longing, hope, and passion that these people are looking for or have, is universal. O'Brien continues to move away from fiction that strictly Vietnam and succeeds wonderfully. The book flows and moves along and you are taken along. I cared for these people. In the end, O'Brien is still my favorite writer and one of America's most talented voices."
3,A long drunken night,"I first discovered O'Brien because of The Things They Carried, then I loved In the Lake of the Woods. The shifts in characters and times in this novel were confusing to me, but many of their stories were familiar. As the reunion goes on, people get drunk or high, promises and confessions are made, only to be forgotten. I couldn't credit the character of Spook Spinelli, such fatal allure at 53! I kept waiting for her to kill herself. Jan's episode as a porn star seemed quite incredible, as well as her masochistic marriage.There are several other very amorphous characters, such as the policeman who tells Ellie that he will be her conscience, who won't let her stop feeling guilty about her lover's drowning and her opting out of the scene; and Dorothy's neighbor, Fred, who seems to know everything about her. This is definitely a novel which I had to read twice, and one which is worth the effort."
2,"Plot, anyone?","Yes, Tim O'Brian is certainly a very good writer... his command of the language, his characterizations, narrative, dialogue, etc. Unfortunately, I expected a lot more when I bought this book. It's an interesting slice-of-life, made better by some interesting characters and scenes. But what else?I didn't expect a rock-em sock-em thriller - I expected a story that has a beginning, middle, and end. He gave us the beginning, but the middle just went on and on, all the way to the last page."
4,Great Entertaining Read,This was my first Tim O'Brien novel. I agree with the other reviews that have characterized this more as a series of interrelated short stories. For some reason these characters and O'Brien's style reminds me of Raymond Carver. I found the beginning of the book challenging because the reader is quickly introduced to so many characters. The strength of the book lies in how O'Brien introduces the characters and their interwoven stories throughout the remainder of the book. My one criticism is the book's premise that so many of these central characters would be so consumed with events that occurred 30 years ago. I struggled to accept that none of them had moved on. But this problem didn't take away from the great writing.
1,Big Disappointment,"Sorry, Tim, this is not one of your best efforts, and a major disappointment after Tomcat in Love. I was one of the few people that laughed out loud with Tomcat, a comedic triumph! I've also loved all your previous books which in one way or another deal with the Vietnam War and its impact on the American psyche. This one did not make me laugh or cry - it was just dull!! Too many characters and I didn't really care about any of them."
4,"Big Chill in book form, but with more substance","Tim O'Brien is a great writer & I really love his subject matter. This book deals with the fading generation of the 1960's, those that lived through it and who are now meeting up at their 30th high school reunion. Funny and on-the-mark, great characters & dialogue as usual. Not a masterpiece, but a very enjoyable book."
3,More Good Stuff From Tim O'Brien,"When Tim O'Brien burst onto the scene a decade or more ago with his collection of stories, The Things They Carried, it was clear America had a literate and intelligent documenter of the War in Vietnam. The title story of that collection in particular was stunning, a beatifully written and highly evocative piece about violence and death. Since then O'Brien has continued to produce terrific books. Their qualities are deep senstivity and muscular prose. In The Lake of the Woods and After Cacciato have been followed now by July, July, a good book about graduates of a college who meet thirty years after graduation and stir up fears and desires long suppressed but never quite buried. In important ways their stories mirror the plight of America at the start of the new millennium. It's a delightful novel, worth reading, as is all of O'Brien's stuff. It maybe just can never quite measure up to impact of The Things They Carried."
2,July July,"I had heard of O'Brien while working at a bookstore. After reading this book, I can say with certainty that I will never pick up another one of his books. This book starts off with a group of people coming back for their 30th reunion. The ones that aren't lushes spend their time with various other vices (acid, men, etc...). All I can say is that if this is middle age, I guess I've already lived the best years of my life. Not a single character has a satisfying life. Even the ones who have made it financially, have ... personal lives. On a bright note, O'Brien's writing is impressive, it's just his story line that leaves ALOT to be desired. Overall, a depressing look at middle age filled with regrets over what wasn't done and nursed gruges over decades."
3,"Another ""dream is dead"" take on the Boomers","I thought I'd read some new insights here, but was disappointed. The same old stereotypes about boomers, yuppies, ex-hippies, viet-vets et al. Ultimately I didn't care about what happened to any of O'Brien's characters. They were all unsympathetic. I'm a boomer, and don't know anyone like these [people]. O'brien isn't talkin' about my generation!"
5,Seven Squared,"Dude - you think you know somebody and then all of a sudden; slam, bam, we produced an album, man! And, what an album at that - BIG sound, BIG voice, BIG fun! If you don't own this album, BUY IT NOW - these guys ROCK!!!"
4,"awesome recording, guys!","In a business where you listen to 100's of demos and cds, it's hard to get excited. Either they're ""not quite there yet"" or everyone starts to sound the same. But with Elf Farm Raffle, they've got ""it"". I totally believe that they can go far beyond their wildest dreams. This is a strong album, great lyrics (sheer poetry), and overall awesome music. I highly recommend this album and seeing them live. Not very many out-of-town bands can ""bring it"" when they play Hollywood, let alone the Viper Room. But Elf Farm Raffle killed it! Totally took Hollywood by surprise. Definately keep an eye on these guys!p.s. come back and play L.A. again!"
5,Excellent jig,"This is an excellent jig. I am a carpenter/general contractor and have used this jig a lot, it is easy to use, accurate, and saves me a ton of time. As well as keeping all the hardware I install dead on accurate."
4,Pretty good for what it is,"This works pretty well. The screws that hold the adjustable parts of this jig hold pretty well, but do strip out over time. I have lost these things before they have failed, but I could see it coming. The only thing is that if you are drilling a whole kitchen, it sometimes is too small for the bigger drawers, and I wish it was self centering on drawer fronts."
5,Align-Rite Drill Guide,These are VERY useful in knob and handle installations in cabinet doors and drawers. I only wish that there weren't so many various sizes of D type handles on the market.
1,useless,I puchased this for a kitchen remodle. Use a ruler or laser level if you have one and you'll be much better off. I returned it.
4,Align-rite --- God bless you....,"Okay -- so I'm no pro at kitchen installs, but I have done a couple. Man -- this align-rite drill guide is PERFECT for doing kitchen pulls, knobs, handles! It cut my time down BIG time.... Now, that being said you do need to measure and set up the tool which can take a bit of time for the first knob/pull/handle. However, once you have it setup you can breeze thru the rest of them -- assuming the cabinets are the same size. I knocked out about 15 pulls on cabinets in about 45 minutes and that was taking my time. I had to do about 10 handles -- they took a bit more time only because not all the drawers were the same size.The owner of the house is EXTREMELY happy with the install... For $50 this tool is WELL worth it. Even if you are just using it one time for yourself -- you can use it and turn around and re-sell it. The time I saved justified the purchase no question.... Thanks AMAZON!"
1,An ordinary cd,"For searching a long time this cd, I was very disappointed. There is only maybe one good song. The case was broken."
3,"Not like her 3rd 4th and 5th CDs, so be warned.","I noticed right away that this was a CD influenced by its time in music. The fun, fresh, polished pop metal sounds of the 80s are very rare on this CD. Instead it has a brooding sound like Pearl Jams music, tho its nothing like Pearl Jams music, but you can tell the Seattle sound influenced the style of this CD.Still this CD is not terrible, I suppose in those days it was difficult for any 80s artist to compete with the 90s grunge. But what about the integrity of your style Lita? Is it really that easy to change what you love to do for sake of popular opinion? Because the music that made you your own artis are from the albums we love (3rd, 4th, 5th releases).All that said, its not a waste of money, and thankfully its MUCH getter than Wicked Wonderland, which in case you didnt know, is total garbage."
5,HOT TRACKS !!!,"ON HER 1995 ALBUM LITA INDRODUCES A LIITLE GRUNGE TO HER MATERIAL ""BLACK"" AND ""FALL"". FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE CD SHE CONTINUES TO DELIVER WHAT SHE DOES BEST : ELERTRIFYING GUITAR PLAYING AND DRAMATIC BALLADS. A SOLID EFFORT A+. ANYONE WHO IS INTO ROCK SHOULD CHECK THIS ONE OUT. GET YOUR COPY OF ""BLACK"" TODAY. SIGNED... MUSIC FAN."
2,What Happened?,"Lita Ford knew what she was doing in the 80s. She got away from the punk feel of the runaways and entered into her true love of metal/arena rock. After waiting a few years after dangerous curves, I was expecting something along those lines. I did not see this coming. Black has a huge influence on this album. I hate the whole grunge scene and to hear it from Lita is very upsetting. She has the skills as a musician to put out better material than this. Hopefully that day is soon. If you are a die hard fan of her like I am, you won't be too upset with this cd. The only tracks that are worth listening to are smokin toads and white lightning."
2,Second to worst Lita cd,"This is the second to worst Lita cd,the other being Out For Blood. She strays from the hard rock music of her previous albums,to make blues.Thats what basicaly this album is.A blues album.If your looking for the hard rock from the 80s,look else were.."
4,a welcome release for the 90's,"I liked this cd quite a bit, though joe, and fall were rather weak tracks. Lita does a fantastic job on vocals and guitar and offers splendid rock n roll on Killin Kind, Loverman, Where Will I Find My Heart Tonight and Boilin' Point. Overall a great album."
3,Not quite as good as her previous releases.,"I agree with the person from ND, the CD is not quite as good as her previous releases, but the CD contains vintage Lita! She belts out her best on `Hammerhead', `War of the Angels', and `Spider Monkey'. I am very pleased that I purchased this CD. I rate it about a 3 and a half out of 5."
3,"Outdated, but interesting","I am far from a feminist but this book had a few things in it that made me bristle, especially regarding hygiene and activites ""not allowed"" during ones period. This is definitely no longer a Young Woman's guide but shows an interesting perspective on the past. It was boring but I suppose that was why it was free."
2,Not a good book,Just couldn't get into the book. It wasn't interesting enough to capture my attention. I just did not like this book.
5,Building a good book!,"Henry always gets five stars from me, but when I was a kid my favorite thing about this book was the very idea of building a real clubhouse. It seemed like such a fun and cool thing to do. I like that the kids in this book take the initiative to have fun rather than expecting adults to provide all of their amusements, as so often happens today."
1,Poor quality book,"The pages of this book were flat and not written on. However, it was so aged that the first night I read this to my son a page near the front fell out. I continued reading around half a chapter a night. 5 days later, the book split entirely in half. Very annoying."
4,Very Convenient Slow Cooker.,"As everyone mentions the real advantage of this slow cooker is that you can brown things on the stove without using an extra pan. But you can also make your gravy in it without using an extra pan (just take your roast & veggies out first!) and you can use the stove to quickly heat your slow cooker to boiling when done with browning. This reduces the chance of bacteria growing while your slow cooker is warming up. I have no complaints. Just remember that this thing is never really ""off"" unless it is unplugged."
2,"Good Idea, but.........","Have had this Slow Cooker since February, have used it several times, and each time my disappointment grows. The cooker has a rounded bottom, therefore it doesn't sit flat on the stove when browning etc. I have a ceramic top stove and it will actually spin on the burner which is dangerous if I don't hang on to it as I'm stirring or turning the meat. And it's rounded bottom prevents it from sitting flat on it's heating element. I brown meat in this on top of the stove on medium heat which is supposed to be part of the versatility. If that is what caused the rounded bottom, then the versatility just went out the window.As other reviewers have mentioned, one has to be very precise when putting the lid on or it falls in.On the good side, it is easy cleanup, light weight(leaning towards flimsy), looks nice and works great for keeping food warm on a buffet. Would not be able to recommend just on those points though due to price."
2,Lid doesn't seal anymore.,"I loved this crock pot for the first two years. I like the oval shape because so many more things fit in it, like chickens, etc. I thought the nonstick surface scratched too easily. It still cleans easily, so that's ok. After 2 years of occasional use, the lid doesn't seal anymore. This metal pan has warped just enough that I can see daylight between lid and pot. The bottom line: it was not a good value for me, since crock pots depend on the tight seal to cook properly."
1,temperature settings don't work,"Had high hopes for this slow cooker based on Amazon reviews, but based on my first attempt (buffalo stew) this device should be renamed ""fast cooker"". All four temperature settings resulted in overcooking. Even at the ""keep warm"" setting the stew continued to boil, so the stew turned into mush. Don't buy it!"
2,Mine cooks too fast!,"Mmmmmmm, interesting; most of the negative reviews here are about this slow cooker cooking too slowly, some virtually not cooking at all. Mine cooks too fast. It didn't come with a recipe book, but I used a tried and true recipe from another book which calls for cooking on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3 1/2 hours. In 6 hours, my meal was over-cooked. This wouldn't be a good item for someone who works out of the house 8 hours a day and couldn't be around to watch it. The only reason I'm not rating it One Star is because of the shape and the ability to brown on top of the stove in the same pot. Now, that's a convenience!"
2,Not for me,"I kept this slow cooker for less than a week. When I realized I'd be cooking for hours - often w/ acidic foods like tomatoes - in ALUMINUM, I ret'd it. Amazon was amazing and easy w/ all of that. I spent more for a cuisinart slow cooker, where the ceramic cooker comes out and can be set on the table (and even looks decent), and I totally love this machine. Use it 1-2x/week, with great appreciation. But it's true about the Cuisinart recipes (I read about them somewhere): they cook MUCH FASTER THAN REPORTED."
4,Westbend Cooker - a good product,"I've used the Cooker several times since getting it, all with good results. The heat control just shows Low, Medium, and High so it's a guessing game to know the exact temperature you're dealing with. My pasta turned a little mushy in my Minestrone soup, but next time I'll add that more toward the end."
4,Good So Far...,"I have only used this slow cooker twice so far, but have had good results thus far. PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU WASH IT IN THE DISHWASHER, BE SURE TO RUB THE NONSTICK FINISH WITH COOKING OIL EACH TIME AFTERWARD AS THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL SAYS. This may have contributed to some users' troubles with the nonstick finish peeling off. I agree with another user that the metal cooking rack would scratch the nonstick finish, so I am not going to use it."
5,West Bend Oval Slow Cooker,"Perfect!! Cooker is teflon which is exactly what I was looking for. I have an older, smaller West Bend that I love, but needed a bigger one. (this one is 6 quart) With the two, I always have the right size. Highly recommend."
1,Wish it actually cooked,"I agree this is technically an attractive piece, presumably quite versatile, however, the primary purpose of a slow cooker should be to cook. This does not. The highest setting after hours barely reached above 200 degrees. My first effort was a ""stewed"" chicken type of dish. After 6 hours, it was still largely raw. If you read several slow cooker recipe books, it seems the underlying concept of the slow cooker is to surround the food with heat - thus the typical cooker is a crock insert inside of a shell which has electric heating elements surrounding the crock. This gives you a constant surrounding heat. This unit (and I assume others like it) trade this design for versatility. Thus, the heat rises from the bottom (why I assume the ""crock"" is thin metal - to conduct the heat). I gather from my experience, this just does not work as efficiently as the traditional type. I replaced this with a crock insert unit. I would definitely not recommend this unit."
1,Thermostat malfunction,"My voice joins the chorus of complaints about this item. None of the four settings affect the thermostat, which is on permanent high. My 8-hour soup cooked in about an hour and a half at the low setting. Foods boil on warm. I was very disappointed in the cooker because, aside from the thermostat problem, it is a nice product."
1,B Raburn,This was a replacement for an older one I had--The unit doesn't get WARM enough to even simmer foods..I have used it three times...I advise anyone looking at this DO NOT BUY!!!
3,my old one seems to get hotter than this one does,I still like this crockpot because its so versitile but my old one seems to get hotter on high than this one does
1,doesn't get hot,This slow cookers heat is so low on high that food spoils before cooks.spagetti sauce took 24 hrs onions and meat still raw. nothing like same brand made 30 yrs ago which I still use. would return but threw box away thinking name brand would be same as previous used cooker. costly item poor quality don't buy
2,Disappointed,"My slow cooker arrived, as others described, with the incorrect instruction and recipe manual. The temperature knob was damaged and broken as well. West Bend was very helpful in replacing the knob for free. What I was not aware of, was that the knob damage also indicated that the temperature gauge was messed up. Only after several tries cooking pot roasts that took THREE DAYS to cook even on the highest setting, did it occur to me that the temperature of the plate was damaged and was too low even at the highest temperature. I don't have experience with slow-cookers, so I had assumed I was doing something wrong. I sent the bottom back to West Bend who agreed to replace it free of charge, but I'm still waiting. I give them points for customer service. I wish I had paid more attention to other commenters."
1,Lousy Manufacturing Quality Control,"We ordered this particular slo-cooker because it was highly rated by Cooks Illustrated Magazine. When we received it, it didn't work. You plug it in and . . . nothing. You look on the bottom of the unit and then you understand . . . it was manufactured in China!! I hate to say how many time I have purchased electronic products made in China that don't work at all or don't last very long. The US Company that decides to shift their manufacturing to China needs to insist on better quality control. I'm going to try and get another one from Amazon and hope that it works. Until quality control improves, we all need to be wary of Chinese made products."
5,Most versatile cooker ever,"I love this slow cooker. It can brown things in on the stove before setting it on its heating base. It can be used in the oven but the main reason I bought it is to prevent heating up the house and it does that successfully. Although it holds 6 quarts, its shape makes it seem smaller. It is definitely easy to store. I have only had it about a month and have used it at least six times since then. It is also very easy to clean. Its non stick surface really is non stick. The temperature controls are accurate and it doesn't burn things from the side like other slow cookers. It heats from the bottom. As a result, it is easy to cook smaller quantities in it than 6 quarts. I am even taking it on a family vacation to a cabin already appointed with cookware simply because it is so versatile I know I will be using it."
5,Deserves its rating,"If you want a crock pot that is truly variable, light weight with a large capacity , this one is for you. The glass top and the pot's shape allow you to easily see how ""slow"" it is cooking. It is very easy to clean. It's easy to brown meat in it before adding other ingredients. Its best feature is that it can be regulated so precisely which is the most important feature of a slow cooker. At this price, it is a true bargain."
4,Brown and slow cook in the same pan?,"This slow cooker is a step above the rest. You can sauté meat in the pan to brown it on your stove, then add the ""slow cook"" ingredients and liquid and let it go on the slow cooker base. They claim that you can use the base as a grill, but I've never tried that part.I've tried lots of slow cookers and never liked the results of the meat. I always found that browning the meat on a regular stove, then adding to the slow cooker had better results. What a joy to be able to brown in the pan on the stove, and then add the rest of the ingredients.Excellent design, though I'd appreciate a slightly more solid pan, and it would be better with an automatic shut off. Over all a good design, and a great innovation in the slow cooker industry."
3,"Fear the METAL RACK against the NON-STICK INTERIOR ""","Yes to everything good reviewers have written on the Versatility. But please will someone tell me why they include a metal rack to go inside the non-stick interior of the vessel? The first meal I prepared was a whole roasted chicken. According to direction I used the rack. Upon washing the pot in warm soapy dish water (with soft sponge) I noticed two small places on the botton of the pot where the metal rubbed into the non-stick surface. Not happy, that spot will only get bigger."
2,FAST-cooker,"I'm actually online today searching for a NEW slow-cooker. This one, which I've owned for about 9 months now, DOES NOT COOK SLOWLY! The tender, fall-apart kind of results you expect to get from meat cooked in a crockpot are NOT what you get with this thing. It's convenient to clean, store, & re-heat; but roasts turn out rubbery, vegetables don't get done, & soups don't do any better than they'd do in a pot on the stove. And that's basically all this thing is: a pot on a heating element... with a cord of all of 2 feet! This is NOT a slow-cooker. Don't bother with it."
2,Not hot enough,I just tested the temp of the water in my West Bend and found that low (which most recipes call for) was only 134 degrees (in the danger zone) and my recipes were not getting done properly. I am grateful that we have not suffered food poisening and plan to contact West Bend to see what might be wrong.I do like the feature of being able to brown the meat in the pan in which you slow cook.
2,warps,I purchased two of these one for me and one as a gift.Received 2/11/11 and used alot. Then one day decided to brown meat............was greatUntil the next time I wanted to use and would not get above 160 degrees even on hot when trying to slow cookCalled customer service and nice lady said when used on the stove top they can and do warp and therefore no longer work to heat properly.They are sending a new crock but I am very dissappointed as the reason I bought was for one pot cooking.And as other readers pointed out only about 5 quarts not 6.
1,Excellent for the first few uses,"I love this slow cooker at first. The flexibility of using it on the stovetop or in the oven, and storing it in the refrigerator is fantastic. And it's nonstick. Using it about 4x a month, I loved it for the first 3 months. While it is dishwasher safe, I hand washed it because of the nonstick coating, and after about 12 uses, the nonstick coating was beginning to flake. Yuck. Worse though, just after that, I used it on the stovetop to brown meat before putting it on the base, and even over a very low stovetop flame, the pot ""popped"" and warped. The pot no longer sits snugly on the base. I called West Bend's customer service about this and was told that it was common but would not affect performance. However, since then, it has not been distributing heat properly a recipe that cooked in 8 hours previously had to be left overnight and still was not done. What a waste of $70. I will be replacing it with a $30 crock one."
2,NOT HAPPY .,I LOVED MOST OF MY SLOW COOKER'S. HAVE ALWAYS LIKED WEST BEND .I HAD THIS SLOW COOKER AROUND 14 MONTH'S AND NON-STICK STARTED COMING OFF AROUND THE HANDLE'S. STOP USING IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT ANY OF THE NON--STICK IN MY FOOD.I USE MY SLOW COOKER AROUND 4-5 TIMES A WEEK..S.K.
4,This game rocks,"This game is really fun! My brothers and I used to be addicted to it, but then somehow it was misplaced and we hadn't played it in years. recently we were talking about how much fun it was and much we missed it, so I bought it for them for Christmas. :) We have so much fun with it! It's challenging and there are a lot of levels so you can play it for a long time. Super fun!"
3,"Good, but with some limitations!","Parents may be somewhat concerned with the movie at the begining where Nasira calls on the ""Darkest evil powers""(vocally), as if teaching our children like that is ok. Other than that I've found the game to be good (so far). You really need a 3d video card to play this game, otherwise you will quickly get a headache. There is some animated violence (use of swords) but no blood, which is nice for a change! I would suggest reading all the reviews both good and bad before you buy this game."
3,A Point,"There becomes a point in music and movies, where something is so bad that it becomes good. Well, ""I love you, you're Perfect, Now Change"" is that!"
4,Change the disc please,"ILYYPNC is neither a great musical revue nor a bad revue. It is simply a very good attempt at trying to make a bad situation look good (or a good situation look bad). It isn't a CD that I will listen too very often (such as PERSONALS - London Cast or RENT) but it also isn't one that will end up in a future yard sale of long forgotten CDs either. It is a bit above a mediocre musical, a bit contrived and somewhat predictable in its presentation, but you still should give it a shot to form your own opinion. As for me, perhaps I will attempt my own production with my theatre troupe in the future as it does have some good material along with some of its shortcomings. Purchasing this CD has at least cemented this on my list of ""plays to look into further""."
3,"Cute, but not really memorable","A light piece. The music is fair, but nothing really stand out or stays with you. As musicals go, this is popcorn, not a good meal."
5,Phenomenally funny.,Such a perfect musical about situations in which we've all been. These lyrics are ones that hit home.
4,"Fabulously Funny, Irreverent and Clever!","This musical revue is great! It's in my CD player right now on shuffle, and every number is unique and fun to listen to, and also so true. This view about relationships is so true to life! I laughed a lot, and would love to be able to get some of the sheet music!"
3,Best PC tennis game so far......,"Which isnt saying much. Most PC tennis games are pretty rotten. Why is it that Madden can have complex blitzing assignments, multiple routes for WRs, game plans, etc and we cant get decent AI for a simple tennis game?It was fun and challenging for awhile, but by the end of a season, youve pretty much got it down. Replay value doesnt really exist.The new version should be out before Christmas 2002, hopefully they will have improved on it."
2,Just a bad game,"Since there are not many tennis games for PC, I said, what the hell. I wasted $10. The game is unexciting, and bland. There are also no real-life player.There is no real challenge to serving. I hit my serve at max speed the first time I ever served! Come on!!However, there is a huge challenge for actually succeeding in a volley or half volley.I game the game a shot and I really didn't like it. Look else where for a tennis game!!"
2,fun for a while,"the graphics are pretty cool and the actual gameplay is pretty interesting, until you figure out how to win. if you are a singles player, no matter who you play as and against, you just need to serve the slow spin serve, then come to the net and volley, and voila! you won the point. this is pretty weak and unrealistic. also the players are imaginary ones and no real ones. you can't even build your own player."
5,Feel the difference,Great product easy to installe.Really make a difference in HP.This is a parts made to your spec so read the dimension and will fit.Recommend this for a quick fix.
2,Not for a 65 lb. pitbull,"Although my dog fit nicely inside the crate, this crate is not pitbull proof. I give this crate a 2 star rating because it was easy to assemble and had plenty of room for her. BUT, I would not suggest using this crate to confine a pitbull, as it is obviously not made for their strength. My dog managed to push herself hard enough into the door for the door to become unlocked and open. I wish the box had not been so torn up when I received it that I had to throw it away, or I would send it back."
5,Happy Puppy in his new cage,"We ordered the 24x18 cage for our 13 pound shihpoo puppy. It is the perfect size for him, not too big, not too small and was a huge upgrade from his previous cage that he outgrew as a puppy. The cage is very easy to assemble and fold up which makes it nice if we have to take him places and we want to bring him with us. He loves going on it and he has plenty of room but not too much that he'd make a mess in his cage. This cage was a great buy for the money. He'll be using this for years to come!"
3,Not really working out for us,"My husband and I recently adopted a 3 yr old Bullmastiff from a local animal shelter - unbeknownst to us, she has separation anxiety! While this crate is easy to assemble/disassemble, it did not stand up well in her attempts to escape. Within an hour she had started bending the frame near the door; within a few hours, her paws were sticking out of the 6"" opening she had made. My hubby was able to bend it back into place (more or less), but we have since purchased a heavy duty crate to safely contain her while we're away. We're still utilizing the Midwest crate at night when she can see us but, unfortunately, it's not sturdy enough for our 100 lb. dog experiencing separation anxiety during the day."
1,POOR WORKMANSHIP,"MY PUPPY CUT HER SNOUT WHILE INSIDE THE CRATE. I CHECKED INSIDE TO SEE WHAT MIGHT HAVE CUT HER AND FOUND THAT ALMOST ALL OF THE WELDS HAD EXTREMELY SHARP EDGES. EACH AND EVERY WELD WOULD HAVE TO BE FILED DOWN. THIS CRATE IS MADE IN CHINA AND THE WORKMANSHIP IS VERY POOR. IF YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE OF THESE CRATES IT WOULD BEHOOVE YOU TO CHECK THE WELDS ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE CAGE AND ESPECIALLY AROUND THE OPENING OF THE DOORS. IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR PET,DO NOT BUY THIS CRATE.I AM RETURNING MINE.Midwest iCrate Double-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate, 42 Inches by 28 Inches by 30 Inches"
3,Good product,"Good product. Does what we purchased it for. I wish we would have purchased the one with top opening. Other then that, easy to set up and clean. We previously had one with the top opening and it made it even easier to clean and interact with our dog."
5,Midwest Pet Crate,"Crate is very well made and has collapsible feature. The well tray holds the wee wee type pads for training, and also supports rectangular bedding"
4,Crate,"This crate has met all my expectations, and the extra door is a plus. I could have given it 5 stars."
4,Good for the Price- May Need Tie Wraps!,"This is a Fair Cage for a Good Price- The Plastice Trey is Good, The Gauge is Not Great and the Spaces are a Little Large on the Side Door, Overall a Good Buy for Under $50 with Free Shipping! A Keeper for the Budget***"
3,DOG CRATE,"Purchased this crate to hold a pregnant cat, in order to keep the kittens together.After opening/assembling the crate, the front/main door latch doesn't line up. You have to lift up on the door in order to slide the latch into a locked position.Otherwise, it serves the purpose."
4,Great Purchase,"Very happy with crate. Easy to assemble, very durable and easy to clean.Priced right Would highly recommend to anyone who needs to crate their dog."
3,Midwest icrate double door,"Crate worked fine the first two months. Now our 45 lb and growing puppy has learned how to open the bottom latch while repeatedly banging on the front of the crate. We need to use carabiners and a bungie cord to keep the door closed and have zip tied the side door. Looking into an alternative, heavy duty crate as we expect her to collapse this one one of these days."
4,great for the price,"It has almost every feature I wanted (would be better with removable doors) and I couldn't have asked for a better price. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that some of the welded edges on the outside needed to be filed down. I cut myself pretty good while folding it flat the first time. But again, the 2 mins with a file was worth not having to pay the store price."
4,good dog crate,This is a good dog crate it was delivered in good shape the only bad thing is that the door doesn't latch very well and is hard to get latched like it doesn't line up right
4,getting the same one in a bigger size!! :),"i guess i should have measured first, haha. Beautifully and heavy-duty made crate. Just smalller than i thought it was... I put my medium sized Rottweiler in it and she couldn't turn around and when she laid down- she took up the ENTIRE cage. So make sure you keep that in mind before you buy and check the measurements. But PHENOMENAL product. Another on thee wayy ;)"
1,"Poorly Made Product, Bent all over, Wouldn't Open","Purchased this product for my growing Wheaten Terrier.When it arrived yesterday, I took it out of the box and immediately was able to spot parts of it that were bent and not straight in line on both sides. When I attempted to fold it open (to make it open into a box) it would not open at all in the 1 corner. I spent approximately 20 minutes attempting to open it until I realized that corner was bent and manufacturer shoved the separator into the corner and it jammed and bent. This made opening the crate almost impossible. After it was ""finally"" opened, I found that several sides were bent along with neither door lines up properly with the locks.When I shut the doors the entire door just sways due to the depressingly cheap material used. I then have to force the door up to get the locks to go through.While I understand that the price is decent for what you're getting, the overall product leaves MUCH to be desired."
4,Great value,"Speedy shipping, great price...a smidge bigger than I think we really need but the size I am imagining may not exist :)Overall, sturdy and we are pleased"
5,just great,"perfect crate for my car, our dog stays calm and secure for long drives, I even bought a second one in which our dog sleeps!"
1,FLIMSY,Very flimsy and not sturdy. My 11 month old Akita can push the latched door open with ease. Beware the iCrate has a very thin gauge wire. I returned these for a refund.
2,disappointed in quality,"Very disappointed in the quality of this crate. I expected it to be like the other I ordered. My other crate has 2 latches for the doors, this one only one and the doors did not close all the way. If a dog wanted out of this crate they could collapse it easily. When I took it out of the box I was surprised how small the wire was and that a couple of them were bent even though the box was not crushed or bent. I really like my Mid-west crate that is the step up from this one with two latches on the doors and much better wire."
1,Disappointed,I bought this case 3 months ago to replace a life stages crate and my dog has gotten out of it 6 times in the last month. He's figured out The sides don't stay up and the wiring is very flimsy. This was a complete waste of money.
5,Extremely High Quality,"42x30 is huge. Bigger than you might think. But for $60, you might as well give your pup that little bit of extra space. Similar products are sold elsewhere for upwards of $100.I received my crate in the factory box, with a divider, and plastic pan to go underneath (in case of accidents). The divider is great if you have a new puppy and expect him to grow big enough to occupy the full cage. You don't want to give him/her too much space too soon for fear that the find a space to use the bathroom inside.The double door also helps. It allows you to position the crate any way you want and still have complete access to your pup."
5,"BEST CAGE, VERY GOOD PRICE","This cage was so EASY to set up (good instructions included) but I didn't have to even look at them. I had it set up in less than 5 mins., took longer to get the box open. The last large cage I had to deal with did not fold down. I ordered the cage because some low life in the neighborhood moved and left 2 small dogs locked in a garage and they got out (thank goodness) and wound up here, I think I will give this cage to the guy that is taking one of them and order another one for myself (I will probably keep the other dog)he will be #3 that I have taken in. THE CAGE IS ONLY WHEN I BRING HIM IN DURING BAD WEATHER (Boy dogs like to mark everything) Thanks Midwest for a good product."
2,Bad choice,"Received w/broken box, not sealed completely so bottom of crate were bent. I mentioned it but no respond at all, bad customer service. I purchased same item before from other company which sent it w/good condition, I was very satisfied. I do not buy any crate from Amzon.com!!"
3,Good value but struggled with divider panel,"The good: our Jack Russell Terrier puppy loves this crate. The bad: the divider panel in the crate we received does not fit properly, being that it isn't quite as wide as the crate itself. At first, I solved the problem by using plastic ""zip ties"" to hold the divider in place. As our puppy grew, I was able to move the panel to a location where it fit better, but then it pulled the sides of the crate inward, widening an existing gap at the top of the main door opening when the door is closed. I'd still recommend this crate. I probably just got a bad one."
2,Dog Gets out too easily,This crate seems well made but my dog can easily escape. Gave two stars because its construction seems good. Whats the point though if you cant keep the dog in it..........
2,would have been nice...,"I ordered this crate to fit into a specific space, leaving a margin of error... it says its 30"" in length, but its actually a little longer - which means it doesn't fit and I have to return it. It looks like it would have worked. too bad."
1,Unsafe for pet & disappointing quality,"When I received this product, I removed it from the box and immediately threw the box away in the local dumpster. Big mistake! After setting it up 2 days later, I discovered that the plastic pan was cracked but still functional. I had been very pleased with a similar product previously puchased from Walmart (ASPCA), but in a smaller size. Since my 4 month old Border Collie puppy was growing quickly, I definately needed to upsize her crate. An experienced vets assistant helped me with the first assembly. The retainer locks seemed flimsy and proved to not hold the ends together. The puppy easily escaped from its confinement in less than 5 minutes. I am now using plastic electrical ties to keep the pieces together. As you can tell, I am still sorry that I threw the box away and wish that I had explored the gauge of metal & construction in more detail. The double doors and the carrying handle are useful considerations."
5,iCrate 1530DD 19x21,"We have a small dog so I can't be certain of strength but it seems plenty sturdy.Easy to assemble and disassemble, 30 seconds or so with no tools.Easy to obtain mats or pads to fit on the bottom pan.Great value for my money."
4,Very Good Crate,"I have now bought two of this exact same crate, one at PetSmart, and one here at Amazon. Considering I didn't have to pay sales tax for my state, or shipping (I'm an Amazon Prime member), this item ended up being less through Amazon than at PetSmart. My only complaint with the one I received from Amazon was that it was slightly bent in places, but nothing some pliers couldn't fix. In all, this is an excellent crate for my rapidly growing male Standard Poodle puppy, and it's easy to put up and take down!"
5,Fantastic Crate,"This crate is great. We have a Boxer so we went with the 42x28x30, which is very big. Our dog actually got out of it twice because we forgot to lock the second lock. We no longer make that mistake and she now has enough room to stretch and play and we can always use the divider panel to give her more/less room."
5,The Great Crate,"I was checking prices on crates and there sizes. I was completely amazed at the price and quality of the crate when I decided to purchase this one from Amazon. It was exactly what I wanted and you just couldn't beat the deal especially with their Super Free Shipping.I've purchased a few things from Amazon now and I've got to tell you the quality is always what they say it will be, I am completely satified and this is where I check things out before going anywhere else now.I've got to be honest, if it isn't free shipping I don't buy it, that is another feature that sold me on Amazon.ThanksCassie"
2,Crappy Crate,"The only way I could get this thing assembled witha modicum of strength was to use plastic ties. Someof the welds have sharp points which can injure yourpet. The end door has so much ""slop"" when latchedthat you need to use a twist tie to keep it properlyclosed otherwise even latched you can move it in andout at least 1 to 2 inches. In my opinion it is a poorlydesigned and constructed crate that a strong dog couldmake short work of. I returned it for a refund."
4,simple to set up and break down...,"Large, clean looking & sturdy crate. I leave it out so that my younger German Shepherd can find sanctuary when her big brother bosses her around. I also broke it down and took it to San Diego when visiting friends. It's really simple to set up and will last forever as long as I don't put the larger German Shepherd in it, he'll tear it apart. Good purchase."
3,Puppy Crate,"Product was easy to assemble. The crate door doesn't close all the way, there is a gap of about 3/4 inches. I have seen other crates that are much more heavy gage metal. Serves the purpose."
4,Metal Crate,"I really like the crate but I had a safety concern. I bought a Yorkie. She weighed 12 ounces when I got her. The latches on the side have wires that are a little smaller apart than the bars on the crate. My puppy got her jaw slightly hung in between those wires and it scared her so I put electrical tape around them to close the opening. She was just trying to chew on the wires but the tape solved the problem. I like the divider. I had my son cut a hole in it, file down the edges, and repaint the divider to separate her bedroom from her pottie room and it works really well."
3,New dog crate,"The crate came and was bent on one of the edges. What should be a brand new crate has a door that is difficult to function because of the bend. We were getting our puppy that weekend, so we just have to live with the inconvenience.Box when arrived was damaged.Door is not terrible but not operating as it should for a brand new crate."
4,Great dog crate,"We got this crate for our Australian Shepherd. The double doors make it very convenient to access the crate from various locations. I think our dog has a little difficulty holding her head up all the way while sitting, but it's a perfect fit length and width wise. In fact both dogs- her and our 40lb border collie mix fit and lay down next to each other easily."
4,Side door doesn't line up properly,"This crate is nice, the only problem I have with it it that the door on the long side kinda drops down. Being that it drop down it's hard to latch, if you lift up on the top though it slides right in. It's just a little hard for my 5 yr old to do. Otherwise, you can't beat the price in comparison to pet stores or even WalMart for that matter! The size is just perfect for our 6 month old Yorkie and he has room to grow!"
3,Midwest 1524 iCrate,"As with all Midwest products, this product is made well. I was surprised, however, to discover that it is so lightweight! It will be more than okay for the small dog that is using it, but I wouldn't use it to travel to dog shows with, as I do not believe it is hardy enough to stand up to the repetitive and constant movement from vehicle to dolly to show itself and back again. I would have liked to see this crate made with a heavier gauge of wire. But as I said in the beginning of this review, the product is made well and it should hold up very well for house training purposes. The double doors are very useful and give a lot of crate placement options. So, yes, this is an OK crate for me to use at home, and in my opinion would be fine for usual home application by anyone."
5,"Great product, great price",The crate is great. Our new puppy loves her new room! The handling of the order and price can't be beat.
1,Complete waste of money,"This crate didn't last my dog one day. The crate is so flimsy, any dog who pulls on the cage can bend the bars, which my 50 lb lab did the first day. Very disappointed. Especially after reading so many good reviews."
3,agility person,I bought two crates. The price was very good. The box of one crate arrived smashed in at one end. The crate was a little bent but not enough to be a problem or return it. I like the two doors because it gives me more options for placing the crates in my van. I wanted two crates to keep in the van and have the other crates to take in to the show site. I gave it three stars because they are much harder to break down than my other Midwest crates. The plan is to keep these two in the van so hopefully that may not be too much of an issue.
5,Midwest iCrate,The Midwest icrtae double door metal dog crate is a good value. The quality is good. Easy to assemble and easy to store.
2,Side door is a terrible design.,"The cage/crate is good in everyway except for the side door. When it is closed, it doesn't close flush and leaves a gap of 1-2 inches. That is enough for a dog to get his paw caught in there and seriously hurt it. I can't accept the side door like this with my little Yorkie. She hates being in any cage and would stick her leg in there and surely hurt it while we were gone. I should have bought the one door type and I would happy with that. How frustrating."
4,Seems okay,"I'll be honest, I don't know a lot about crates. The two door design is very convenient and the divider is nice as she grows we can give her more space. Because of the placement of the doors, I can't make the crate as small as I'd like without losing use of the side door though. Also, there are some clips that hold it together when its packed away that I can't get rid of. My puppy chews on the clips all the time because they're just sticking out."
5,Madrigals at their finest,Earth Chants; Choral Works by the Madrigals of SBHS. Stereo recordings of superb quality - on par with Deutsche Grammophon. The songs are performed with amazing diction. An excellent addition to any music collection.
1,This price is for only one small pack.,"The $11.33 price is for only one pack of these. I'm used to paying much less in the store, about $3 a pack. These are my favorite sushi wrappers though. I have to drive out of my way to get them, so I thought buying them through Amazon was a good idea. I should have read the description more carefully. Another Amazon seller has these in a 4 pack for about the same price but not with free shipping. I saw this one and decided to purchase it because of the free shipping. It wasn't until it arrived that I saw it wasn't for a 4 pack. I'm returning it. It's a great relief that Amazon is good about returns."
3,There is better,"This book was okay at best. I found 'Life and Death on the Internet' by Keith Schroeder to be a far better, interesting and informative book. Personally, I would pass on this book and get Mr. Schroeder's."
1,Looked cheap.,"This item was a disappointment to me. I thought it would be a fun bracelet to wear when I didn't want to wear expensive jewelry. But, it looked really cheap. It would be great for a teenager/child, but not for an adult woman."
2,Chris.. you're amazing... but what is this?,"Rice's previous albums are fabulous and extremely well-crafted. AMUSING, however, falls quite short of his other works. The songs lack depth and none of the tunes are really memorable. If you're looking for the best Chris Rice albums, check out ""Smell The Color 9"" and ""Deep Enough to Dream""... those are worth your money. (Don't worry Chris... I still think you're really swell)."
5,Best.,"This is a great album from one of the best artists on the planet. Along with all his other albums, he is a master lyricist And musician."
3,mildly amusing is right,"I very much agreed with Mark's review. It isn't that it is a bad album, it just isn't as good as I've come to expect from Chris Rice. ""When did you fall"" is my favorite on this album. It is a fun exploration of what happens when one all of a sudden realizes that they are liked. Oddly enough, ""Breakfast Table"" might be my second favorite; exploring what it is like to lose someone. But my interest in this album falls off pretty quickly after that. What I like about Chris Rice's writing is how often he leaves me thinking, ""Wow, that's exactly how I feel, but I just didn't have the words."" I don't get that as much with this album. And I don't think it is merely a shift in topical focus, although that is present. I just don't think that this set of lyrical offerings gave voice to my feelings as well. I don't think it is as witty as his previous offerings. It is not a bad album, it is just that Rice has consistently written better."
2,Well...,"I loved Run the Earth, Watch the Sky. It is one of my all-time favorite albums. But...Amusing doesn't live up to Chris Rice standards. The songs are bland, and uninspired. I will be careful before buying Chris' next album. I love you Chris, but this song lost it's catchy hooks and melodies."
2,Amusing? Not really....,"Chris Rice is a great talent who has spoken to me for a number of years now, but this album just doesn't quite cut the high standards he's set in the past. He almost sounds disinterested. 3 or 4 listens down and I am finding only a couple of tracks to put on the old iPod. Love Like Crazy being one of them..."
2,Don't bother,"Save your money. These were cheap and didn't last long with two rambunctious dogs. Our Border ate her way through our lab's collar within a day. They aren't trustworthy for pulling either. For a little dog they would be fine, but for anything over 40lbs. forget it."
1,Pnoney Baloney,Listen carefully to the tracks. They are cover bands copying the original music. When is Amazon going to get wise and get rid of this kind of junk that wastes our time?
2,Interesting real-life story told poorly,"The story of a CIA operative in Hawaii that was hung out to dry by the federal government, this is an interesting story with many layers of truth and deceipt, including revelations of then-VP George Bush, CIA head-cum-media mogul William Casey, and the very judicial system that we trust to maintain law and order. Unfortunately, the author fills his chapters with redundancies and poorly executed summaries and in the end reveals various other spy-thriller type scenarios that would have made his book that much more interesting if he deemed them worthy of inclusion. A frustrating read on several levels."
1,"Sorry, but I just didn't like this book.","The author of this book, presents the info in a scientific manner, but in the end he goes way-way-way overboard.If you are training I can sum up all of the valuble info you'll get out out of the book as this. Do sets of 5-6 with a rep count of 10 seconds contracting the weight and 10 seconds lowering the weight on each rep.--That's it--I just saved 'ya $$$ from buying the book.Nothing more valuable here, and even that basic level of info, I still question its efficancy and effectiveness to a seasoned weightlifter."
1,doesn't work,"I ordered this cable because the other review said that both lines worked, just one at a time. This was the exact usage I had in mind. However, the other review was wrong, only one side of the splitter actually works, the other is always dead. It's basically a 9"" ethernet cable. What a useless cable."
4,Know what you need...,"This adapter is designed for office network patch cabling applications. It simply splits the eight pins in standard Cat5 cabling into two RJ45 ports. Since ethernet networking only uses four pins of the available eight in Cat5, this adapter will use the extra four pins for a second network connection. This means you must have TWO of these adapters, one connected at each end of a CAT5 patch, in order to use them correctly.The previous reviewers were obviously victims of the poor and incomplete description given here. The manufacturer's web page (http://www.startech.com/Product/ItemApplications.aspx?productid=RJ45SPLITTER&c;=US) gives a more complete description, but some networking knowledge is recommended to properly utilize this."
1,I did return it,"It did not work with my application, therefore I returned the product as soon as i noticed it.Otherwise it would be a good product"
3,RJ45 splitter,I thought this would work as network splitter. I was wrong. Only works as telephone line splitter.
5,Buy this!!!!,This is a collection truly worth owning! All of the included DVDs are masterpieces! You will not regret this purchase!
3,"Great movies, horrible price.","All six of these movies are incredible movies that every movie lover should own, not just anime lovers. However, the price for this pack is outrageous. As of this writing, all six movies are in stock on Amazon and can be had individually for about $126. Just buy them separately.So, 5 stars for the movies, 1 for the price, and split the difference."
5,south american baroque,"Until recently I had never heard of the South American music greats; people writing at the same time as Mozart, Beethoven and the European Masters, but their music is every bit as great as the Europeans. Stunning arrangements, original approaches, vast choirs and orchestras, the music of baroque South America is infused with a reverence and devotion to Catholic liturgy equal to or greater than that of Europe. One of the surprising, delightfully so, aspects is the influence of indigenous music from the Andes,the jungles, and the pampas upon these composers. Sublime!"
5,A BEAUTY SINGS THE STANDARDS,"Cheryl Metrick knows her music. For those of us seasoned listeners...we are overjoyed to hear a singer sing the correct melody and lyrics while at the same time adding her individual style. With the class of a Shirley Bassey, Cherl sings with joy and sincerity in her lovely voice... and you know this is a singer who understands the musical nuances and the message of a song. Along with the extraordinary Frank Owens, her arranger and musical director, this CD is a keeper. I look forward to Cheryl taking the stage again soon because I know she will take her performance and music to a new plateau, one in which we do not hear enough of in this day and time. She has many fans and I am one of her biggest and we are all waiting for the next live performance and new CD."
2,Of no fault of NatGeo; these topo maps are lame,"1. I first tried these electronic topo maps when they first came on the market years ago; actually when the current NatGeo maps were owned via the ""Topo"" company. I was very disappointed in that product and thus didn't utilize any cpu based mapping application for many years. But with the nice slick advertising of the current NatGeo maps, I decided to check out this product.2. Bottomline, cpu based topo products still stink. The maps are not detailed enough, it's still moderately slow (but not bad), and the bottomline is, for a place like the bay area (ie basically urban territory), you're better off just getting a decent hiking book or paper topo maps; you'll actually have more helpful information that way. Perhaps in the next generation of electronic topo maps things will change, but forget this product."
1,Save your money!,"I found this movie in the bargain bin and got it on DVD for (money)- at that I was ripped off! Cynthia Rothrock plays only a minor role in this ""Golden Boy"" rip-off (although probably it predates that movie). The fight scenes are no better than average and the dubbing diabolical. I can think of no reason that would pursuade me to part with nearly (dollar amount) for this fiasco!"
1,That cd is letting soul down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I am very sorry but do not listen to the likes of brian dryburgh; this cd I believe has let soul music down. I like soul music as i like many types of music but this one? NO. If you want good music buy the blues brothers soundtrack!!!! or if you want be a little more adventurous buy a cd by the prodigy or Disturbed. I'm very disapointed with this it went straight in the bin.
5,Probably the Most Important Book of My Childhood,"I read this book when I was about 10 years old and I've never forgotten it. What I recall was how romantic the life of the uncle seemed to me at the time. When I re-read the book years later, I saw that the author felt that the uncle was an irresponsible figure. I still love and respect the uncle character. Not all of us are nuclear family and white-picket fences people. All hail the uncle, Jack Kerouac and being On the Road! This is a wonderful book and I recommend it to everyone."
3,Good war fiction,this book is relitivle historicly correct in that it has the guns and area rite it uses harsh language and gives gory discriptions but it is good for a few hours of entertainment and I liked it you should check it out from the library or buy in it is good
2,Not as good as it looks,"After waiting for more than three weeks, I got this skillet. But soon I found that the glass cover doesn't match the skillet. Looking carefully, I found skillet is not square, but has big distortion."
3,Too small for anyone's liking.,"I'd like to say first of all that I have bought from Dan's Jewelers multiple times and I am a huge fan of their work and craftsmanship. And really, I have no problem with the craftsmanship here. The pendant is well-made, cool looking, and the cord is reliable. My only grief with this particular item is that it's so damn small and it absolutely looks terrible being so little. There's a lot of detail in this necklace and I think that the pendant should be much larger to show that detail."
4,"Good content, but not enough...","This is a fine CD to complement anyone's Kovacs, comedy or easy listening collection. Some Kovacs tunes, like ""The Irving Wong Song"" and ""Hey, Taxi!"" are not on this CD, and they are missed. I could have done without the second version of ""Oriental Blues"" if either of these songs had been included. B+ for effort and good package."
5,THE album of 2000,"This album is an absolute must! With it's hard rock tunes to it's moody ballads, ""Silencer"" is a masterpiece. You'll enjoy Zed's music whether your young or old because their music isn't too loud but it's not too soft either. If your into Silverchair, lifehouse or Our Lady Peace, ""Silencer"" is the album for you.Bonus disc:- You'll enjoy shaking your booty to the live tracks on this CD. It also includes 2 new fun songs and a remixed version on 'Don't You Wish'(which sounds like a video game but it's cool if your in the mood!) Better yet, go see these guys in concert if you ever get the chance coz Damn, they ROCK!!"
5,If you love the who....,"don't miss out on this.if you have all of the albums already on CD or your i-pod, I guess you can save your money.but if you just have a few records and a CD or two, I say go splurge on the box-set, it has all of my favorite who songs on it, and probably yours too.this would make a great gift too."
2,Disappointing,"I recently heard/saw the WHO on TV during the Sandy Hook fund-raiser at which several pop artist groups appeared. I am NOT a pop music lover but do enjoy selected pieces. I thought there 'Who Are You' song the WHO played that night was just fabulous and immediately went on Amazon to buy a CD w/ that song on it. The 2-CD set is 'good' - not great. Yeah, it's the same song and the same band but the sonics as I would call them lack depth and dimension. Maybe that's a problem w/ all pop music CD's - I don't really have many. I played it twice and put it away and doubt I'll bring it out again. I prefer to remember what I thought was an extraordinary performance at the Sandy Hook fund-raiser and not imbed in my memory the so-so CD version."
2,"Great selection, incredible band, unbelievably bad mastering!","You know there is a problem with the sound on a disk when:1. It sounds good in the car with the windows down.2. It sounds kind of grating with headphones on a decent portable.3. It is brittle, metallic, and painful to listen to when you play it on a studio setup with Focusrite 24bit/192khz DAC's!I agree completely with the reviewers who criticised the sound quality. This disk is insanely overcompressed, there is no sense of space between the instruments, and the highs are tinny and brittle.This worked as an intro to the band, but I'm going to replace it with ""Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy"" and the remastered ""Quadrophenia"", which are supposed to have great sound."
5,"Not ULTIMATE, but Still Fabuous Nevertheless","The best compilation.HOWEVER, rent the Amazing Journey (2-DVD) to get what's going on with this group and the music. Enlightening and beautifully done...for an die-hard fan as well as a novice.Furthermore, don't miss Athena, Old Red Wine, Real God Looking Boy, and some of the fine solo work of the prolific and genius Townshend: Slit Skirts, Let My Love Open the Door, A Little is Enough, and Daltrey's: Avenging Annie, Mirror Mirror, Days of Light, AND most of the newer Endless Wire CD.It's 40 years of rock 'n roll combined with food for the soul, all in one. Never tire of this stuff! I hope they come out with more new material in 2010."
4,The Best Of The Who,"I am a Who fan since 1991 and I was thrilled to purchased the 2-CD album. It has almost the Who's classic hits including my personal favorites ""I Can't Explain"" and ""I Can See For Miles"". For any fan of the pride of West London, this CD album is for you."
3,Great but pointless,"If you already love The Who enough to buy this thing, thing you already probably have all the songs here. Nice sampling of songs though. I still hate Squeezebox, however, and was annoyed by its presence here. :DIvan Rorick"
2,Ultimate Who,"ESSENTIAL FOR ALL ROCK FANS! It is amazing how much material these guys put out and how great it was! This is a great selection of their material except for the omission of ""Athena"" and ""It's Hard,"" from the early 1980's album ""It's Hard."" For all but the Hard core fan, this is all you need! So buy both and be amazed."
1,Terrible mastering,"I just got around to playing this cd and it's TERRIBLE! it's all loud and bass and muddy. It was so bad I popped in my Who's Better, Who's Best AAD cd to hear if maybe my recollection of the sound was wrong and I was correct this cd is terrible. I think it was remastered for the license plate rattling generation. Those that never heard the WHO will probably like this but it's not the real Who sound. I just threw my copy into the trash and will never purchase another Jon Astley remaster or a UTVRECORDS product.It's just a terrible, terrible sounding recording that is nothing like how the Who sounded."
5,"The Who - Ultimate ""Great Collection""","I purchased this collection because I did not have a good archive of Who songs spanning their entire career. The last collection I had purchased was ""The Who's Greatest Hits"" (on vinyl) many years ago which contained only about 10 or 12 songs. I purchased the two disc DVD of the ""The Kid's Are Alright"" a few years ago which I have enjoyed watching tremendously and wanted to update my music CD collection of The Who. I would highly recommend to anyone to purchase this set if you are into this band. I wish the liner notes had went into a little more depth about the tracks and included more band history, but I got some of that when I purchased ""The Kids Are Alright"", so.......just buy this set, you won't be disappointed."
4,Probably is ultimate,Definitely a great job on the collection and the booklet is worth a lot of the price as well.
4,The Who for Beginners,"This CD is The Who- 101 for any new Who fan that you would like to acclimate with the band...like your kids, for example. Great listening for old fans, as well."
1,"Great music, completely unlistenable remastering","I was recommended this collection as the best compilation of The Who hits. And indeed, the selection of songs is great.But what does that matter when the listening experience is dull and flat. If you turn it up, everything is getting loud and tiresome with no impact. If you turn it down there is still no impact, and it is still tiresome and dull. I simply can not listen to this. It may work as background noise when you are cleaning your house, but for an enjoyable listening experience, go digging for original, non-remastered releases.True musical enjoyment is impossible with this release."
4,The Who...Rock...End of Story,"...The Who are truly the godfathers of punk. Oasis would not exist but for the Who. Second, Keith Moon, the so called unknown drummer, on his worst day is far superior to Ringo on Ringo's best day. Ringo's son, Zack Starkey, was Moon's protégé! To compare the Who to Duran Duran (whom I do enjoy) is like comparing steak to hamburger. Pete Townsend is the quintessential lyricist. Roger Daultry's voice and stage presnece is legendary. The late John Entwhistle is Bassist of the millennium. And Keith Moon is truly the greatest drummer of all time. With that incredible lineup, it is no wonder that the Who has been considered one of the greatest bands ever. Even after 40 years when you think of great rock bands, the Who is near the top of the list. 40 years from now will anyone remember Oasis or think that they were relevant? Probably not!..."
4,You could do worse...,"For twenty bucks, it makes a nice entry level Who investment. However, you're far better off spending the extra money and getting the four disc box set from a couple years back. And for those TOMMY fans out there, invest in the 'Isle of Wight' and deluxe 'Live at Leeds' discs. They are simply the best live albums you can get, (not including The MC5's 'Kick Out The Jams'). Long Live Rock...."
2,"GREAT CD, BUT CHEATS YOU OUT OF 5 SONGS THAT ARE ON THE UK VERSION","This is a great CD, but could have been a greater CD as it cheats you out of 5 songs that are on the UK Version of the same title.The U.S. version is 2 discs with 35 songs total. The UK version is 2 discs with 40 songs total. All of the songs on the U.S. version are on the UK version. However, the UK version has 5 more songs on it. They are:1. Had Enough2. Don't Let Go the Coat3. The Quiet One4. Another Tricky Day5. AthenaSo I bought the UK Version in the Amazon UK store in January of 2009. And I paid less for it then I would have in the U.S. Amazon store!! In U.S. dollars, I paid $[...] for this CD which included shipping & handling. If you're interested in buying this CD from the Amazon UK store, here's the link:http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultimate-Collection-Who/dp/B00006NSCK/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1292265516&sr;=1-1I hope this review was helpful."
1,I'd rate this triple 0 if I could,"I'd rate this triple 0 if I could!Hoo music is totally like Rap music, it is music by spoilt and neglected filthy brats who need to make a lot of ugly noise to claim their so-called validity. Connoisseurs of life rightfully understand these outings and these characters donot I repGhalia"
1,MUSIC FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IDIOTS!!!!,"The Who were never a good band. They only produced 1 good song in Won't Get Fooled Again, their other songs just suck. They suck just as hard as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, and Pink Floyd. The singer just screams. This is noise. Avoid all the albums from loud bands such as those and get any albumfrom Dire Straits, Foreigner, Green Day, Guns N' Roses, Aerosmith, Neil Young, Tom Petty, and Nirvana insted.Whirligig."
2,Waste of time AND money!,"Out of the 35 songs on this double album, you would be hard-pressed to listen to anymore then their known hits!"
1,THE WHO SUCKS,"Wow...I can't believe anyone likes this band so much. They are f*ck overrated. This is a very dissapointing collection thus these guys never made a good song. Unless the only good song would be Won't Get Fooled Again and that's it. The rest of this is noise! I hear them on radios and it is NOISE! F*CK THE WHO, ROLLING STONES, BEATLES, LED ZEPPELIN, & PINK FLOYD. GET GREEN DAY, DIRE STRAITS, OR GUNS N' ROSES INSTED. THEY ROCK!"
1,WHO FOR BABIES????,"Thanks to the Who. Their only good tune is Wont Get Fooled Again. Anyone else says, they are great??? Nope they are horrible just like THE BEATLES AND ROLLING STONES. GO GET ANYFOREIGNER INSTED."
4,Great CD,"The Who: The Ultimate CollectionFor those who like the music of The Who, it's hard to beat this set. It covers almost all of the band's hits that you've heard on the radio during their time, and perhaps some you don't remember hearing, but for Who fans, it is one of the best anthologies available on CDs. Enjoy!"
5,the Ultimate Collection THE WHO ..REMASTERED,the remastered tracks of songs like wont get fooled again. sound better now that they have been remasterd .it really blew me away a box set worth getting senece the passing of there bass player If you are a who fan order your copy today
4,"The Definitive ""Radio"" Who Collection","If you're a Who fanatic that likes non-radio-play album cuts, this may not be for you. If you like the Who and have always wanted a ""greatest hits"" collection that contains everything you've heard on the radio, this 2-disc set is for you! I admit, there a are a few things I would love to have on this collection that aren't on it, but overall, there's no room for complaints. I'll go as far as to say that if this had ""A Quick One While He's Away"" live from the 'Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus' CD, ""Athena"" and ""The Amazing Journey"" from 'Join Together,' it would be the Who collection I would record for myself to play over and over in my car. (That's not a bad idea.) They did throw in a few cuts that I didn't expect on a radio hits collection. This collection ranks with Tom Petty's Greatest Hits, BowieChanges and The Very Best of Elvis Costello and the Attractions. An excellent career-spanning compilation."
4,Who's all dat,"Very good collection for those not interested in collecting all Who audio,Nice chronological order. Some Who material like Tommy and Quadrapheniamust be heard in sequence to fully appreciate."
4,A good taster for The 'Orrible 'Oo,"Back in the '80s, my ex-girlfriend was really into The Who and I started liking them too...but when we split up I didn't want anything to do with them (I know, stupid)! Now, almost 20 years later, I've decided to rediscover the band who covered all the inspirational bases from power pop to heavy metal to punk.This really is a good compilation showing how much the band progressed from their original ""British Invasion"" beginnings to the harder rock of ""Who's Next"", to the operatic ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia"" and finally on to the '80s pop-rock of ""Face Dances"" and ""It's Hard"".Listening to this it's easy to see how Townshend, Daltrey, Entwistle (RIP), Moon (RIP) and Jones influenced so much in rock music.And guess what? My wife likes it too!!!Some have said that getting this will make most not want to buy the original albums. Not me. I want ""Who's Next"", ""Live At Leeds"" and ""Quadrophenia"" now."
2,Terrific Music Terrible Sound Quality,"Oh why did they do this? The music on this album is absolutely great. However the sound quality is so bad that it really is obviously terrible on anything more advanced than a 1960's car radio.Please redo this album, this time spend some effort on the sound quality."
5,The Who is Alright!,A phenomenal collection from British Invasion days to the greatest recordings ever. Highly recommended for the complete Who fan. WHO
1,Don't get fooled again.,"What, a new year and yet another Who compilation. Just how many different times can the greedmasters repackage the same old obvious songs? Even poor old dead Elvis hasn't had his bones picked this brazenly.Shame, too, on Pete Townshend for supporting this swindle--on his web site, he clearly comes out in favor of this re-re-reissue.Look for a used version of the 5-CD boxed set, which contains the right mix of hits and odds and ends. Or spend your money on used CD versions of ""Who's Next,"" ""Sell Out,"" ""Tommy,"" and ""Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy"" and, if you've got an additional money to spend, get ""Quadrophenia,"" ""Odds and Sods"" and ""The Who By Numbers."" With that, you'll have a complete collection of 95% of the Who's essential material (the other 5% being bits and pieces from from ""Who are You"", which you can miss and not cry too much over). Whatever do you, don't encourage these repackagers to continue these useless swindles...boycott this album!"
1,Never Arrived,Unfortunately this CD was lost somewhere in the bowels of the United States Postal Service and never arrived. The company was QUICK to offer to remove the charge.
1,Those idiots,"I purchased this CD only to find out on of their highest charting UK hits and popular USA FM rock track ""The Relay"" was missing, which was a crucial hit between the band's Mod days and the quintessential ""Who's Next"" album. This CD set gets 1 star for missing a key selection. This is why big time record companies suck ass. It's all about the money, and they purposely omit tracks like that the albums and CD singles continue to sell. Take a look at your other favorite compilations, as a basis for this. Why is always something missing. Only the out-of-print ""The Who's Greatest Hits"" contains this particular track. To the label MCA, wake up and satisfy the band's fans!"
1,Many great songs. Upgrade to 5,Many great songs. A clasic. I also recomend Quadrophenia. Some distortion that is mostly from the original mixing because I heard the same distortion on Who's next for the same tract. I give this a rating of 5.
2,Who's Overrated?,"I never really liked the Who, their only good song was Won'tGet Fooled Again. Baba O'riley is also great too. Bargain, great!! Join Together is overatted, and played on radio toomuch. The who is overrated!!!"
4,A Substitute of Meaty Beaty Big & Bouncy (Excuse the pun),"Normally I don't buy compilations as the actual records are better, however The Who has some awesome singles. Now, Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy was an LP a while back which was a compilation of all these singles, but they never re-issued it. So the best way to get the singles is to go buy this.The song choice is very good, though more stuff from Quadrophenia would be nice. It's not a bad choice at all. It's just that in my opinion compilations are stupid as they don't hold historical value.If you don't much care for getting the singles, get a copy of Quadrophenia (Their best album in my opinion), Live At Leeds (The most amazing live album ever), Tommy (Forget the Opera junk, it's just fine Rock and Roll) or The Who Sell Out (Your best bet for early Who and also the proto-Tommy)."
5,What the !@#$ Are you Thinking,"This is a fantastic compilation of my favorite band of all time's best songs, and I can't see why some one would be disappointed. To Pissed off critic, you have to be the DUMBEST reviewer I have ever seen. First off, this is in no way their debut album, because that was over thirty years ago. And of course their music sounds like it was made in the 60s and 70s, BECAUSE IT WAS! Why you bought this CD is beyond me, because you obviously have never heard of The Who."
1,from a person who is in her own way a Dickinson scholar...,"Customer reviews prior to this one here, as well as the author and publisher's manner of presention of this book blatantly titled THE DIARY OF EMILY DICKINSON, present a kind of ethical dilemma to this reader and lover of Dickinson's poetry.Unless literary history has changed mightily while I, like a modern Rip Van Winkle, slept right through it, the fact is that IF Emily Dickinson ever kept a diary or journal, it was either suppressed or destroyed. Probably the latter, by the same friends and family members who heavily edited (and had the audacity to change Emily's words in) the first printings of her poems.You will note, if you read the reader reviews posted here before this one, that two out of three amazon.com readers believed they were reading a diary actually written by Emily Dickinson herself.I am frankly distressed by the publication of a book that does not make its fictional nature more obvious and upfront."
1,Deceptive title and even more deceptive content!,This book is fiction and yet when I picked it up I thought I was getting the actual diary of Emily Dickinson! The writing is similar to what Emily might have written in her diary but she did not write any of this. The author takes way too many liberties with this title and deceives those of us who are true fans of the immortal Emily Dickinson. Read Emily's poetry instead and you will find a living diary directly from this beautiful woman's life.
4,Aviation Video Review (DVD),"The aviation dvd ""Squawk 1200: Tales From the Air"" is a worthwhile purchase. The reporter/pilot Andrew Schmertz covers several interesting stories related to flying. I particularly enjoyed the ultralight story, where a guy has a giant fan strapped to his back and is practically asking to be injured. A close second would be the remote control segment which not only highlights cool RC jets, but the whackos who have devoted their lives to the sport to the point of almost losing their families and bank accounts. Andrew tells his stories with a hint of Dennis Miller type sarcasm, but doesn't get in the way of all the great footage.Having seen quite a few aviation videos, I would recommend this DVD. -Jon"
3,Cruddy Guthrie,"Woody Guthrie appears here with Sonny Terry and Cisco Houston, and as a solo performer. These significant 1940's folk recordings are marred by unexpected handicaps.A few tracks on WOODY GUTHRIE * EARLY MASTERS (""Hey Lolly Lolly,"" ""John Henry,"" ""Ranger's Command,"") sound pretty dreadful (worn 78s), while the solo performances in particular are very clear. Biographical liner notes have a strangely compressed font that's nearly illegible. Oddly, the playlist that shows up on WMP is totally skewed.This one's too flawed to really recommend. Three stars purely for historic value.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 34:37"
4,Could not wait to return to story!,"I read the story on my Kindle Fire. Because of the enjoyment, I have purchased three additional books by W.E.B. Griffin. I initially was put on to this author by a friend who visited from Canada. He is a Canadian Army Officer. The Griffin books keep reintroducing the same characters, a technique which made me feel that I was staying tuned in to old friends. I was in Army Aviation on the tail end of the Korean War . . . excuse the mistake, ""the Korean Police Action."" When I read the Aviators by Griffin; it brought back many memories. Griffin is very accurate in these historically-oriented novels. I am just finishing the Captains . . . this book did not have the impact as the others, although it did tell the remarkable experience of ""The Duke."" The other two of the four books I read are the Generals and the Majors.I intend to order another later tonight.Respectfully, a very satisfied and grateful reader."
4,Great Collection of Motivational Songs,I was looking for a collection of exciting tunes for motivation.This is the best source I found. Well worth the money!
5,Brilliant and HEALTHY Entertaiment for your children,"Let's take on look on each one of them.THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JOE. Cool adaptation of the Biblical story of Joseph (the dreamer)as a Western. Focuses in the moral and christian principles. The ""break"" song in the middle, courtesy of ""Boyz on the sink"": Wow, GOOD SONG.// As usually, contains more aditional material.// CC. Subtitles. Only english spoken.THE ULTIMATE SILLY SONGS. Top 10 hosted by The Pirates who don't do anything. Enjoy: The dance of the cucumber, The hairbrush song, The Cebu song, The water buffalo song, and more.//Not subT. only english spoken.THE WORLD OF AUTO-TAIMENT: SuperSilly watch to the future (of the silly songs). Very smart and funny songs. Pa-Grape and Junior perform great songs.// With SubT. only english spkn."
3,"insightful,crucial study for any student of arts and christ","Lee Ryken offers the world of biblical scholarship a wake up call to an all too often ignored subject in church circles - the arts. the question of how exactly those seriously pursuing a life of artistic integrity melded their passion with Christ and his message - has been a tight-rope walk for the christian artist for decades. Insightful and well written, this book brings to bear a reconciliation of too-often-thought diametrically opposed disciplines into a marrage of calling and creatorship."
5,spray in kennel before groomer visit,"I use this to help my cat be calm when I take him to the groomer for clipping his claws. He is a pretty high strung cat and he never has any problem getting his claws trimmed. Before putting him in the kennel, I put a towel in the bottom of the kennel and spray the towel with this product. He is VERY relaxed when I take him out at the groomer's so I attribute that to this product. I hope it is always available for us!"
2,not for sensitive breeds,"I sprayed as directed, but my Burmese rag doll cat fled from the room. Not for pets easily put off by smell. I will stick with Bach's Rescue Remedy liquid in his water bowl."
3,Not really sure if it works,"I don't think it does anything, or much of anything. It might have a very slight calming effect if you use more than what it recommends and spray a room several times. It also warns to not let the liquid or residue remain on any surface so that's a little confusing, if it would be harmful to the cats then why make this stuff? Right? But a single spray of it sure does nothing at all. So I suppose the thing is to use more - but with due caution."
4,Baseball Masterpieces,"For a baseball history buff, this is one that brings back great memories. Many black and white images of the earlier 50's, 60's, and on up highlight some of baseball's greatest players."
5,Wow,"I just bought this for my husband. But I had to peek through it myself because I was so curious. As a wife I can tell you that I would be thrilled if my husband did these things in the book. I only read the first 50 and the intro, that was plenty. This book could not be put in a more simple form. Brief and right to the point. One or two sentences per page. The book doesn't really go into why the ideas work, which is perfect. I sure hope my husband takes these to heart, it would most definately help the romance level if he did."
4,wacky,Bill Murray....can't be too bad...good performances by the young leads....if you like off beat and weird you will like this one
5,Wonderful Wes,Its a quirky ride. Everything in this movie had me enchanted.I knew this would be a home run and it didnt let me down.
4,Weird but good,"Set in the 60's, it has a slew of great actors. It is one of those kitschy movies that you just can't stop watching despite the absurdity of it all. Don't take it seriously and it is fun."
1,???,"I'm still confused about the rave reviews for this movie. I thought it was very strange, to say the least."
1,Don't do it,"Not worth your time. First of all I was expecting a lot more from the combo of Willis and Murray. What a combo, but they didn't do anything. I turned this off after an hour and much deliberation of whether or not this movie was worth watching more of. This movie was a fantasy trip of someones idea of first love. Please do not let your children watch it, its really not for kids, let alone adults. I tend to believe that this movie represents an adult's fantasy about childhood first love than anything else. I couldn't bear to watch it past the scene where two eighth graders get ""married""."
1,Lost in the storm,"Some good acting, but the script wanders off into the deep blue sea. Lost in the storm. A waste of money to rent."
1,Terrible plot and style,"I would not recommend this movie to anyone,did not like the movie and consider very bad enterainment,if I could give it 0in stars I would"
2,Blu-Ray void of special features,"There is no commentary audio, and about 10-15 minutes of behind the scenes which were already available on the internet.I love this film but this release was barebones. I imagine they will rerelease it with more content to the Criterion collections while getting more money from Wes Anderson fans.I would void buying this release if you can manage."
1,What a waste of time,I am glad we rented this movie instead of buying it. I read reviews and was looking forward to a quirky but interesting movie. It was indeed quirky but completely uninteresting. You never care for the characters and I kept hoping one would turn into a zombie. Don't waste your time with this dull senseless pablum.
2,Not as funny,When I rented Moonrise Kingdom I thought that it was going to be funny but it turned out to be more a drama than anything else. I wish they could refund my money :(
3,Not Rated,DVD was purchased for a gift. I have not seen this movie therefore I cannot rate it one way or the other. DVD arrived to me as scheduled and was otherwise not defective.
2,don't waste your money,"Bizarre, disjointed story and action. Too over the top with unbelievable weather disasters and other events that did not go with this particular story. Credibility was non existent."
5,"WES ANDERSON's ""A"" game","I have to say I am a huge fan of all wes anderson's films; his style of story-telling is unique. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" has all the usual ingredients, excellent cinematography, witty dialogue, mark mothersbaugh's amazing music choices, a great story and a phenomenal cast. this is a must see film. buy it now."
3,"I hate to say it, but...","I think this movie might have been overrated. Maybe my expectations were too high? It was cute and entertaining(ish), but a little slow and long toward the end. I've heard lots of people say it was ""the best movie of the year."" It wasn't bad, but it did seem to try really hard to be artsy or different or something. Just okay, in my opinion."
3,"Not Great, Not Terrible","After watching the trailer, I knew this was going to be kind of a quirky, odd movie, which is great because that's the kind of comedy I like. This movie at least succeeded in being different, but I kept waiting for it to get not only funny, but more interesting. The two main kids' characters are almost robot-like, speaking in short monotone sentences. I understand that was part of the characters -- not bad acting -- but it got old pretty fast. Overall, I'd have to agree with what a few other reviews here said: The movie was OK, but the best stuff is in the trailer."
3,Quirky.,"Good cast. Some of the kids will probably grow up to be adult stars a la ""Stand by Me"". A bit slow at times."
2,Mediocre movie,"If you don't have anything else to do, this would be OK to watch, probably. I rented it because of Bruce Willis."
2,I didn't get it,"Maybe this was based on a book or something? If so, maybe the book is much better. I just thought the storyline was hard to follow and didn't really get the point."
2,Quirky is an understatement.,"The story of a boy and a girl coming of age, that's bizarre to the max. With a star studded cast I expected something quite different. The film is shot in what I can only refer to as a ""choppy style."" The characters are all strange and difficult to relate to. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one, was because it was partially filmed in Rhode Island. That was it's only appeal."
3,"Wes, why are you so precious?","I came of age with Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums. Now, 15 years later, I feel like Wes has almost become a parody of himself. There's just not much evolution in his work. Everything is so precious, the kids are precocious, and a whole cast of extremely talented adult actors are underutilized. If you are expecting Rushmore caliber Bill Murray, look elsewhere. More broadly, I think my issue was a lack of a engaging story. Off to catch the bus...in slow motion...set to a 60's era punk song."
2,Disappointing,"The young boy, one of the main characters, had a terrible speaking voice. It got harder and harder to listen to him. The acting was wooden. I like many of the actors in this film and kept hoping it would get better. It didn't."
3,A little weird,"I like the main actors in this movie and had seen the trailer. It looked interesting but I found it a little weird. I'm having trouble classifying this movie. Is it about family dynamics, coming of age, or both? I liked Bruce Willis in his role because I could relate to his personal conflicts. But the other characters were really way out there. And I have to say the lead girl and boy were very strange. Really, children getting married and for what purpose? I would rate this movie 3 stars mostly because of the wonderful job the camera man (woman?) did. The scenery is beautiful."
2,"Great movie, bad resolution","I watched this on my tv via hdmi through my macbook. The only resolution available was low-quality and very pixelated. Excellent movie, I really enjoyed it. However, having paid $3.99 to rent it for 24 hrs seems very steep considering the quality, I assure you it was not my connection."
4,One of Anderson's Best Films,"This film is funny and poignant. It almost feels like Wes Anderson wrote himself into the story. Find your inner child and celebrate along with the main characters as they seek their slice of freedom. Well written, well acted and well directed."
5,"Quirky, stylish, hilarious, and poignant","This is one of my new favorite movies! I LOVED the quirky sense of humor, the cinematography, the simple, poignant love story. Every scene and line could be thought about and carried symbolism to something much broader, deeper, and universal. I especially loved the sincerity and honesty between the two main characters and how that forms the basis for true love in any relationship. I enjoyed each character in the film and thought they were perfectly cast. My favorite line: ""I'm on your side."" Brilliant!"
4,Good for kids,Perfect video streaming from AmazonMovie was a nice family film with wholeheartedly healthy morals. I'm glad that I waited to watch online.
4,quirky but loved it,"loved the movie...quirky, off beat. Characters are well formed and add great depth to the movie. Just adored the whole ""FEEL""of the movie... the scenery, the time set in, the acting.... found amusing. Not laugh out loud funny, but amusing."
4,"Quirky, fun film.","This was a quirky, fun comedy with great character development. Loved the Boy Scout scenes since I'm a Scout Master. Moonrise Kingdom has some subtle humor and some ""laugh out loud"" moments too. I would reccommend this movie."
4,Moonrise Kingdom,"I rented this movie after not seeing it in the theater. I really enjoyed it, i did not love it though. it was a sweet wes anderson film."
4,Hum?,"Well, to say the least, it was a weird film. Not that weird is bad, I'm weird, so there. If you are into weird, try it."
4,Best Wes Anderson movie?,"I've watched most (if not all) of this director's films, and, while I loved them for the offbeat, quirky, and somewhat-arty feel, I still scratched my head at the end going, ""Huh?"" This movie is still a little weird, but it has so much heart compared to his others. Really sweet movie."
5,Witty and clever,"Moonrise Kingdom is a brilliant movie about two kids falling in love, running away, and the absurd reaction of an entire island when they disappear. While the acting comes off as flat, that seems to be a mechanism of the movie, rather than poor acting on anybody's part. Very funny, in a cerebral way."
4,It's a One-of-a-Kind Love Story!,"A very quirky sort of film with a consistent eclectic style all its own. Edward Norton as the OCD Boy Scout Instructor is fun to watch as are the two young leads in the film who share a ""young love"" story quite unlike anything we've seen onscreen in the past. Visually the film is as unique as its direction and story-line. The film is peppered with nerds, bullies and other interesting youngsters and Bill Murray is particularly amusing in his role as Frances McDormand's wife and co-counsel, as they are both knowledgeable, yet ""not quite right"" lawyers. As I said, this film has plenty of style and a lot of warmth, too. It's exceedingly watchable and a good family movie for a rainy Saturday afternoon. Totally a Wes Anderson film from start to finish!"
5,Quirky well made film,Fantastic movie with a great star studded roster. The kids were wonderful and they are definetly the stars of the movie. Lighthearted and fun. Will definetly watch again.
4,MOonrise,"Really awesome movie. Heartwarming and touching. I didn't think they were going to make it , but they did. Get it."
1,Big Disappiontment,"This film strongly reminded me of SWALK or Melody, by Mark Lester. That was a film about two sweet children falling in love and running away together, and their misunderstanding parents, teachers, and even a scout master. It was actually made in the era depicted in this film, and it is loaded with charm and the wonder, energy, and optimism of childhood. This film really ought to be classified as a remake. It suffers horribly by comparison. All the characters are stiff and depressed, and depressing. Even the children. A comparison of the two films illustrates and emphasizes the ravages of 40+ years of drug culture (both psychiatric and illegal). I could barely tolerate this lifeless dud of a film. But Bill Murray was reliably entertaining, as usual."
1,Nothing but Trash,"This movie was made for perverts and weirdos. If you're a normal person, don't waste your money on this trash."
5,Great movie,A great movie which my boyfriend and I enjoyed greatly. It was everything I expected from a Wes Anderson film and the acting was supurb.
5,great Movie,"You just have to see it the kids were fantastic in this movie. It was a refreshing different movie, a must see"
4,Delightful Movie,"This was a great, and quirky movie. I enjoyed it tremendously. The scenery was awesome also. It is a little offbeat."
5,Great,Off the wall and funny. Very entertaining story. Great acting on the kids part and what a fascinating cast. Very quirky.
5,Quirky movie,"Sweet, odd story. Big-name actors in a little-publicized movie. That tells you something about the quality of the film. Endearing. If you liked the TV series ""Pushing Daisies"" you might like this. Similar visual effects."
5,A wonderful surprise!,"I had never heard of this movie, but trailer looked interesting. Turned out to be a GREAT quirky film! Don't know why it wasn't a bigger hit!"
5,Enjoyed it!,Really good. A quirky film. Hard to describe. Good actors and interesting characters. Highly recommended. Will buy the blu ray. :)
4,good offbeat movie,This was a strange but interesting plot for a movie. It inevitably leaves you feeling good after many opportunties for disaster.
2,Moonrise Kingdom,"The quality of the movie was bad, a lot of digital breakup although it was supposed to be full HD and we have all of the required hardware for that. The movie itself did not appeal to me, either."
3,prepubescent youth love story,"Two strange kids falling in love theme made an over rated movie in my view. The movie ""Deep Impact"" made better use of this theme as well as weaving a more complex and exciting story line. The quirky kids and strange parents in Moonrise Kingdom just barely held my interest. This is an old story going back to the times of Romeo and Juliet, Like Shakespere, you could also call this a tragedy only from an entertainment standpoint."
3,interesting,"This movie was highly recommended, so I was kind of waiting for something fascinating or beautiful to happen. It only kind of did. Good compared to a lot of movies, though!"
3,A Comic Book for Children,"Wes Anderson's films are an acquired taste.From ""Rushmore"", ""Bottle Rocket"" to ""Royal Tannenbaum"", ""Darjeeling Limited"" and ""Life Aquatic"", I've seen most of hisfilms with the exception ""Mr. Fox"". I've got similar impressions after watching each of his films, light, quirky(including the names of the films), colorful with not much of a story and did not leave much impressions afterwards.This film is no exception. It has great production design, engaging actors, some from top drawers, colorful and quirkybut it is so light that did not make a good movie watching experience, for me. It was like reading a comic book for children. Love him, or dislike him, Wes Anderson."
5,Nearly perfect,"Wes Anderson's best. By far. The out-of-nowhere stars are amazing, and the film is stylized just enough that the kitschiness doesn't overwhelm the story."
4,Wes Anderson's best (so far),"One of my favorite movies in years. Wes Anderson's magical thinking is unapologetically on display here, but the most remarkable thing about this movie is how deeply it understands the experience of being 12, and combines both a child's and an adult's understanding. As for the product, I was a little disappointed with how few extras there were on the disc and not much printed material. The fact that it shows up with a zillion formats is interesting but mainly useful for people who want to play it at home, in the car, on the iPad, and on the computer all at once (meaning, I suppose, lots of kids) and that's not my situation. So even though I love the film it's a little hard to justify $25 without more extras."
4,Fun,"Almost surreal...children talking like perfect adults, adults accepting children's reality...funky little story with good actors. Not as weird as Tim Burton, but almost!"
3,Not the best.,"I love Wes Anderson films. They are all vaguely the same and have similar characters- but that's ok. In this case though, it didn't feel like the same characters in a different situation... it felt like the same characters in a pastiche of several Anderson films stuck together. Entertaining, but far from great."
2,I cant believe somone was willing to pay money to make this film...,"a clear case trying too hard and appealing to a very narow audience. terrible story, performers acted as if they knew the secret but forgot to tell the audience. un waste your time.derage children having sex and parents out of touch with reality. a tale of people who have lived on an island too long and force their children to be the victims. sad statement on our regional east coast life. dont"
2,Quirky and boring,2 hours of my life ill never get back. Nobody like able with little humor and gratuitous violence against animals
3,It's Different.,Strange and sometimes it borders on weird and then again there is an ultimate beauty in this piece of fiction. Well acted with a few of Hollywood's best and the boy in the lead role is going to go a long way if he doesn't lose his natural personality. I was close to giving it four stars and changed my mind. Pg 13 is the right rating for this film.
3,OK movie,Got this on recomendation from a friend. Different kind of movie. Good to see big name actors doing different kinds of movies. But you do have to be in the proper mood to appreciate it.
3,"It was ok, but didn't get into it that much.",The movie just had a strange pace to it at times...I guess I should have expected this from a Wes Anderson movie.
3,Average movie,"Funny story line, filmed in a beautiful location, the director could have edited out all the swearing words, I recommended it."
3,It's out there,"Just an odd, quirky movie. I rented it to see where it was filmed in Rhode Island, but I didn't recognize a lot of the areas."
3,Moonrise Kingdom,"This movie was recommended as entertaining & quirky...I can take some quirkiness, but it was over the top for me. I did enjoy the 60s look and feel, but I kept waiting to discover the whole point of the movie, which was never really revealed."
2,Strange movie,"We had read great reviews when this was in the movie theater. It was ok, quite slow. It reminded me of the slow pace of Fargo, but less entertaining."
2,The Royal Tenenbaums Redux (Almost),"Wes Anderson might need a new movie concept. This was too much like The Royal Tenenbaums (same palette, quasi-surreal sets, droll characters, etc.), but without its originality or narrative. Movies need not be plot driven, but a little more narrative arc or a little more movement within the characters' psyches would have made for a better movie."
2,Good actors in a very strange movie,Considering the cast of well known actors I was expecting much more but was disappointed.Maybe if you like dark comedy...
2,overrated,"A very boring movie, that was over rated. Cute kid acting, but did not like this type of movie at all."
2,Predictable and boring,The movie just didn't interest me. I regret ordering it. There wasn't much going on and I was bored to tears.
2,Tedious,I wanted to like this movie and it did have its moments but mostly I found myself looking for stuff to read during the movie to keep me even halfway engaged...
3,"Good, but not W.A's best","Quirky film as you would expect from W.A. Not quite up to Rushmore, Bottle Rocket, but the two young characters to a decent job. Small roles for Edward Norton, Bill Murray."
3,Odd movie,This was a so-so movie. It was difficult to keep track of the story line. It did have big name actors to keep interest where lesser actors might not have given the story.
3,Quirky and interesting...,We watched this movie when we were trying out the Amazon Prime trial service. It was quirky and interesting. The average Netflix rating is 3.6 I would give it a 3. Entertaining but not memorable...
3,"cool, quirky, enjoyable.","With limited options, I decided to give Monrise Kingdom a shot. It turned out to be an a, cool, quirky, enjoyable film. Worth renting."
3,not worth buying,"Maybe I set my expectations too high, but I was disappointed. At a different point in my life I may have like this movie better."
3,Quirky,"Quirky film, not really compelling....but some cute and funny moments. Not really my sort of movie-I prefer action or drama."
4,Moonrise Kingdom (Two disc combo pack,"This a one of those movies that seems to work on many levels. The story is quite ridiculous on one level but it deals in a very real way with the angst of children growing up. The ongoing description of Purcel orchestral piece is surprising and pleasing, the acting and directing are superb. We have watched it several times in the DVD and the BlueRay. The BlueRay version was hard to boot up for some reason."
5,Quirky Adventure,"Lots of great actors in strange character roles, gorgeous set decoration and costumes, hilarious dialogue, all the hallmarks of a great Wes Anderson film. I could watch it over and over."
4,Moonrise Kingdom,Odd and quirky is the simplest review of this movie. Wes Anderson has certainly captured the sentiments and errant emotions of the adolescent. Certainly worth viewing more than once.
5,Quirky,It's a quirky gem of a movie. Many layers to it that beg this movie to be re-watched. Very enjoyable and priced right for rental thru Amazon
5,Refreshing,"For me this is the ultimate feel good movie. Makes me think of two of the most important things growing up, the Outdoors and first love."
5,"A delightful, funny movie",Wes Anderson fans will take great delight in this release. Others should find it charming and engaging. It's a funny movie with a wonderful cast.
4,Good Movie,"It was a pretty good movie. I was glad I watched it, but I probably won't buy it. All the actors did great, the atmosphere is unique, definitely worth watching."
4,"Quirky, but Lots of Fun","Moonrise Kingdom was very well done, and good for a couple of hours of escape from the real world. I think many viewers will see a bit of themselves in one or more of the main youth characters. Enjoy!"
5,amazing but not for everyone,"Watch the trailer. If you like it, do not miss this movie! The movie is like the trailer but even better. That's pretty rare but very true in this case.To be honest, while this is one of the best movies I've seen, most people I know wouldn't like it. Also someone with no memories of that era would have to miss a little of the richness of this masterpiece. Realistic in a way but more artistic in that it is a lie that tells the truth. And it does so beautifully."
4,Very Enjoyable,"Delightfully quirky. I was left wanting a bit more more dialogue, more Bill Murray, more Bruce Willis and more Frances McDormand...LOVED the young actors and the unexpected turns..."
3,Kinda dull,"I really don't think this film would have gotten nearly the attention it did had it not been labeled ""artful"".Once labeled as such, who would find it boring except the unsophisticated?Call me unsophisticated."
1,tttteeerrrrrible,this piece of crap is terrible the actors and writers should send out refunds to the poor saps that rented it
1,NO special features???,"I thought this movie was great, but I will NOT purchase a bluray DVD where the producers are so miserly that they include no special features what-so-ever. In this day and age an anemic offering such as this is simply unacceptable and I won't buy it."
1,"Movie in the long lines of Fargo, or anything by Quentin Tarantino","Sorry I jest don't get into the goofy plot, monologue lines and dry suspense of the fake 60's. Save your money."
3,"Sort of okay, I guess.","I wonder how many more movies are left in the Wes Anderson oeuvre. I fully expected to love this, but it just didn't resonate with me - even though I am a huge fan. All the things I like about Anderson's movies - the cinematography, the unique narratives, the dry, clipped dialog, the attention to minuscule detail - seemed forced and predictable in Moonrise Kingdom. I just didn't believe the love story between these two at all, though they were both wonderful in their roles. I did love the Hank Williams soundtrack. And I'm happy to see Anderson has found a wider audience.Life Aquatic, Rushmore, Royal Tannenbaums - these movies inspired me. Moonrise left me a little disappointed."
3,Renting Moonrise Kingdom,I love this movie and have been wanting to see it again! Got excited when I found out that I was able to rent it from Amazon and stream it from my computer. BUT very displeased with the quality. It looks great when it is small but as soon as you choose to make it full screen it gets all fuzzy. I felt that I was watching it as if it were downloaded and not from the real footage. I'm disappointed and I probably won't rent another movie from amazon again.
2,Not so much,This movie just dragged on. I couldn't wait for it to end so I could get on with my life. I do not recommend you waste your time on this movie.
2,Boring,Thought the movie was pretty boring. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking to be entertained. I turned it off with 45 minutes left.
2,Watched about 20 minutes of it,"The plot was confusing and very slow to build. If a movie doesn't hook me right away, you've lost me. I guess the acting was okay, but again it was an odd plot with odd characters."
2,"Not very good, I hate to say","Wes Anderson, where have you gone wrong? I loved Rushmore and then Royal Tannenbaums a bit less. This movie has just fallen off the cliff. The look still has some appeal albeit the novelty is gone, it looks like a film made by the Instragram app. Bill Murray is excellent in another version of his broken man character but overall this film should be skipped."
2,Too quirky,The previews showed you a cute quirky cast. Didn't realize that it would go from cute quirky to just strange. Didn't care for the movie at all.
3,Not so bad... not so great,"I'm a big fan of Wes Anderson's films. Rushmore is one of my all-time favorites. I also really liked Life Aquatic, though I think it is considered by many to be his least interesting effort. Moonrise Kingdom was nice, and charming, and mostly true to his vision, but I found it to be a little too self-conscious and perhaps a tiny bit overwrought.Also, Amazon's streaming service seemed a bit wonky on the day I watched it. Perhaps it was my Roku. Hard to say exactly. (No stars were deducted for this aspect)"
3,just ok,"this is a dry humor movie. I liked it but would not watch again. Just kind of slow going but it has a lot of good actors in it which is why, imo, that it works."
3,More of the same from Wes Anderson,"You should know by now what you're getting into when you check out a Wes Anderson movie. Oddball characters, all with the same artsy monotone adult voice (even the kids) that find themselves in silly situations. I rank this above Steve Zissou, but it's WAY below Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, as far as comedy goes. Don't expect too much from Bill Murray in this one. He's barely in the movie at all. The real star is Ed Norton as the scout master. It is a sweet movie about young romance and how you can find love even if you're a troubled weird-o."
3,Like Eating Cake for a Meal,"Wes Anderson movies are like eating only cake for dinner. The first piece is delightful. The second piece is good. The third piece is really just too much. By the final piece you think ""now why did I like that first piece so much?"""
2,"Great cinematography, Quirky plot","The good: Two 12-year old eccentrics find friendship in each other. The bad: it's odd, unrealistic, and accentuates character flaws. At best, it's a spoof. At worst, an awkward plot that lurches from one silly episode to another."
3,Nice Film,"I guess I didn't get the warm fuzzy feeling about this movie. I was really looking forward to seeing it. It was sweet & a bit weird.I think it was supposed to be artist, For that I give it 1 thumb up"
3,Disappointed in this movie!,"I bought this movie without hearing much about it, based on the actors/actresses. I was really disappointed in it and wish that I had only rented it!"
2,Expected More? Better?,"As a big fan of Anderson's Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, and even a fan of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, I had high hopes for Moonrise Kingdom, especially given the positive reviews - an 84! on Metacritic.I was very disappointed in Moonrise Kingdom. Still trying to figure out what it was about: first love? pre-teen angst? precociousness? how parents/adults scar their and other kids? the soul crushing evils of living under the boot licking heel of the pseudo- boy scout state (to paraphrase Big Wednesday)?It was the weakest of stories IMO, with more than pedestrian dialogue. Now, perhaps non-fans of Anderson's works would make the same complaints about his other movies, some of which, like Rushmore, I think are great movies. But Moonrise Kingdom to me comes across as a half-assed effort at story-teling and film making.YMMV"
2,Don't watch if you don't like precocious children,"I don't understand why so many people who previously disliked Wes Anderson like this movie, for me it is one of his least successful efforts - actually not unlike one of those skits where kids read the lines from presidential debates, or maybe one of those ads where toddlers speak like adults. Here all the action is with two children, who mouth words that are clearly coming from an adult (and hipster) mind. Painfully boring and unoriginal."
2,"To be fair, I didn't like Wes Anderson movies","Slow, long looks, and lots of scenary shots (some are very nice). Its a typical comedy of errors and I'll admit I laughed, a little. But I really don't get Wes Anderson, I saw The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, in the theaters and swore never to make that mistake again. I watched this on Amazon thankfully. I'm a huge fan of movies and really wish I understood where Wes is coming from! But I can only appreciate bit and pieces, but not the product as a whole."
3,Meh,If you like quirky.. then go for it... If you like a plot that makes total sense.. stay away.. :)
2,MOONRISE KINGDOM,WELL IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT A GIRL AND A BOY. DON'T LOOK FOR A LOT OF FUNNY THINGS AS THERE ISN'T MANY. POOR ATEMP BY SOME BIG NAMES TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF A POOR STORY. MAYBE IF YOUR STONED IT WOULD BE A BETTER MOVIE TO WATCH......
1,Don't Believe the 5 Star Reviews,"Watched this with family, and among the six people watching, none of the group liked this movie.We watched for 30 minutes, only because the reviews were so good. We would have watched it for 10 minutes before turning it off had the reviews been honest.This movie is very slow, the plot isn't coherent and headlining actors have very minor roles. I'd consider them cameos really.This review will probably be down voted into oblivion, although I felt compelled to write this since the movie was so bad. I rarely or never write reviews."
1,"Slow, boring, and bizarre",I can't believe this received good reviews. It was a bad movie that only a New York reviewer would love.
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"If you have seen one Wes Anderson movie, you have seen them all. Have you ever been to a place where every single person was quirky and acted exactly alike? No? Neither have I. Not a single character in this movie even remotely resembles an actual human being. We seem to be transported to planet Quirky which is inhabited by a bunch of clones who all act and think alike, and thus who are all extremely annoying. I used to like Bill Murray (back in the ""What About Bob"" days), but he seems to have gone off the deep end in his movie choices over the past decade. Save yourself a massive migraine headache and avoid this movie."
1,Not For Me,"I watched the movie for about 30 minutes and couldn't watch anymore. Although I appreciate and enjoy quirky, independent films, this completely missed the mark for me. I couldn't connect with any of the characters because there was really no character development. It was as if the screenwriter and film maker said, ""lets put together some crazy, quirky characters and see what happens."" For me, their experiment failed."
3,Over rated...slow,This movie was quirky and different but I found it very slow and really not that entertaining so I can't jump on the band wagon here with all the 4 & 5 star reviews. I feel like people think it's hip to love anything with Edward Norton and gave this movie a little too much credit because he was in it.
3,Meh.,It was okay. kudos to Bruce for going old and dumpy on this. don't understand why the wonderful Frances Dormand took this less than meaty role.
3,"Hardly a memorable film, but very Wes Anderson-y.","It was a cute movie, but ultimately fell flat with me. I found the whole relationship between the two teens a bit annoying. It seemed quite forced."
2,not so great,Good story line but the movie itself wasn't that great. With all of my favorite actors I was expecting something awesome. The background Music was suspenseful the whole time leading up to nothing. Eh.
3,It's too bad I am not a Wes Anderson fan...,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (A Comedy/Romance DVD review)...It was ok.Genre: 8.5 Movie: 5Become a fan of ""The Lowedown"" on Facebook.What's it about?Set on an island off the coast of New England in the 1960s, as a young boy and girl fall in love they are moved to run away together. Various factions of the town mobilize to search for them and the town is turned upside down -- which might not be such a bad thing.What did I think?This is classic Wes Anderson work...it's too bad I am not a fan of Wes Anderson. I gave it high marks, as it was a great film, But I found it odd and difficult to follow. Not like ""Inception"", as I wanted to watch that one a second time...I just wanted this one out of my player. If you are a fan of Anderson's work (""The Royal Tanenbaums"", ""Rushmore"", and ""Life Aquatic"" are examples), then you will love this movie. I will leave it in the store for you."
2,Everything I could do to get through it,"This movie had great ratings and I had heard so much about it, but to me it felt like the story was going nowhere. There was no point."
3,Not Wes Anderson's Best,"Watched this one twice...at home. His movies just don't seem to warrant having to be seen on a big screen because the stories are always intimate and charming but not really cinematic masterworks that rely on a grand visual scale to have impact. It was fun and slightly eccentric like all of his films, but I almost felt like this one was starting to become a little formulaic. It just didn't stick with me like Rushmore or Royal Tennenbaums. Still, I'll eagerly look forward to what comes next and definately make the effort to see it."
2,Not impresses,"I wanted to see this in the movie theater, but missed it. I am glad I only paid 3.99 for the rental. This movie was slow and boring. I couldn't even get through it in the 4 hours I was on the plane. It was awful, I don't recommend it."
5,So Original,"This film took my heart. I loved the Royal Tannenbaums and Fantastic Mister Fox, but the honesty of this little jewel is like a piece of rich dark chocolate (70% or higher) wrapped in marzipan. The colors and the fact that the principlel characters are so young might fool you, but the story is firs rate and the actors are amazing."
1,squirming uncomfortable young teen love scene,This movie was not at all what I was hoping for and the uncomfortable love scene between the two main players made me look away. They were way too young and it was awkward and unnecessary. I really wanted to turn it off. Disliked it a lot.
1,AWFUL,This is one dull & silly movie. Pointless & not worth watching. I had hoped for something a lot better..
1,Dreadful,"Just awful. Boring, dull, poorly done. Hard to say anything good about this film. I couldn't survive more than the first 20 minutes before I had to turn it off."
1,Bad,Not funny - this style is just TIRED. It peaked at the life aquatic - and that one may have just been lucky since Bill Murray and Jeff Goldblum carried it. Each iteration appears to get less funny - same art style.Pass on Wes until there is a Life Aquatic 2.
5,intruiging,"This is definitely the kind of movie that you want to watch with someone so that you can talk about it afterwards. The main characters are delightful, and Bruce Willis and Edward Norton are excellent in their roles."
4,Good clean weirdo fun,I am aware that there are people that are less than enthusiastic about Wes Anderson and his work. Those people are wrong.
5,like,this is a lazy sunday movie. grab popcorn curl up and laugh cheer. makes you giggle a little... would recommend
4,"Strange movie, quality of stream very good",Overall enjoyable and funny yet a bit dark. Bruce Willis once again the man who makes it right.No issues with video quality
4,If you like Wes Anderson,This film will live up to your expectations. It's a pre-teen love story but has all the usual quirks associated with his films.
4,Great movie!,Everyone needs to view this! A very un Bruce like movie! I think that they really brought their point across!
2,Why such great reviews?,"I don't understand why this movie was so critically acclaimed. Inappropriate scenes, very boring. My whole family missed the point of this movie and was glad when it finally ended."
1,I don't get it...,"I heard it was a very good movie so watched on dvd. I just didn't get it. It was boring and uneventful. I wanted to laugh, forced a few chuckles out to try and enjoy it but no luck."
1,Ridiculous,"This movie was not worth watching. Also, there's a part in the movie where a girl strips down to her underwear and bra. Like we need to see that."
1,Disappointing free gift,"I ordered the Blue-ray/DVD of 'Moonrise Kingdom' and got an e-mail stating that I get the Amazon Video On Demand version for free. I thought this was a pleasant surprise until I went to view my video library and it was listed as a 24-hour rental that expires in one month. There is nothing in the e-mail that I received indicating that this video is a rental or that it expires. Granted, I did not order it and was not expecting it, but the e-mail was misleading enough that I'm giving the video 1 star even though the movie itself was excellent."
1,Lame-O,"Not for kids, not for adults... creepy at points ( I won't elaborate, let's just say it harkens back to the 'educational' episode of DIfferent Strokes). Sorry Bill Murray was in this - what a waste of talent."
4,Wes ANDERSON delivered,This is one movie that I plan on watching many times. I saw it in theaters and knew I had to own it.
5,Might just be Wes Anderson's best movie.,"Absolutely loved this move. The all-star cast lives up to their talents.You DO NOT have to be a Wes Anderson fan to enjoy this movie, this is fun for any and all."
4,Made me laugh...and these days that's saying something...,"I am not usually one for either ""kid"" movies or comedy and putting them together is usually an ""avoid at all costs"" for me...this Moonrise Kingdom is an exception to that longstanding rule. I just loved it. If you need a chuckle...enjoy. That being said, my 17 year old daughter hated it...but my 14 year old loved it...so who's to say...perhaps my 14 year old had more in common with these wacky characters (and so do I)."
5,Brilliant,"Wes has done it again! I loved it! This is a fascinating, dark, and witty portrayal of family and love!"
5,superlative!,everything about this movie is great. i am a longtime fan of wes anderson and this does not disappoint. every frame of this film is filled with a richness of detail that is hard to capture.
2,Cute... But weird,This movie was simple and odd. I don't think i will ever watch it again. Just not super fantastic. Interesting cinematography and good acting.
3,Good story if you can get past the staged look,"What is it with this director? The story is very good, but everyone sounds like they're reading from a page and the buildings don't look real. Kids don't pose like that, people don't walk like that, nothing seems natural at all. I guess that's fine if you are into Wes Anderson."
3,Good airplane entertainment,"I downloaded this movie to watch on my return airplane trip. (I was one of the options on the way across country, but no movies were offered on the way home.) It was very quirky, but entertaining. It helped pass the time. Not a theater price attraction."
3,I usually love Wes Anderson,"...but for some reason, Moonrise Kingdom just didn't do it for me. I just didn't feel a connection or a draw to the characters in it as I have for past characters he's created.But, it wasn't bad, still better than probably 60% of the movies out there. Maybe it will get better on subsequent viewings."
2,Very different kind of movie,The premise of this movie is interesting but the filming is so odd that it seems awkward. I can't recommend this movie.
4,Melancholy,Same feel as The Royal Tanenbaums. Same writers and directors. This is possibly a movie for a depressed viewer. I enjoyed this better than the last few flicks made by the brothers.
2,Eclectic film with hard to follow plot,"Basic Boys meets girl moving, and Tween discovery in the 1960's. The depiction of the ""Khaki"" scouts, was funny and and a hazy romanticized reflection of the BSA at it's high point.Unfortunately Bill Murray's character along with Bruce Willis' where very one dimensional and uninspiring. While these actor can absolutely pull off dead-pan roles, it just didn't see to work in this film.The films tempo build a sense of anticipation, vaguely like a clockwork orange, but never pays out."
4,Moonrise Kingdom,"A wonderful and delightful summertime film. Filled with the innocence of youth, the quirks and flaws of adults, the feel of summer camp with drama and heart. Not to be missed."
4,Moonrise Kingdom,"It's kind of a quirky movie with a great cast. Definitely strays from the mainstream formula movies, but is entertaining and worth seeing."
5,Great sleeper movie amongst a sea of blockbusters.,Couldn't stop watching and it had me laughing. Sophisticated humor. Dry pan. Just loved the story line and humor. A movie with great re-watch-ability.
5,Very Enjoyable Movie,"If you enjoyed ""Rushmore"" and ""The Life Aquatic"" you will really enjoy this movie. Story and good and the acting is great!"
5,Best film of the year,"An orphaned 12 year old boy scout in 1965 and the 12 year year old girl he falls innocently in love with... Wonderful cast, great script, incredibly evocative, great direction, beautifully shot; Wes Anderson's best film so far."
4,My thoghts.,The characters are very human to the point of hummer and at moments striking me deep in my core. This but at the same time this is temper with the character’s surroundings that are rather ridiculous.
5,Quirky but good,Quirky but good. Don't know what else to say. Words words words words words words words words words words words.
5,great movie,Probably the best movie I have ever seen.Don't miss it.The relaionship betweensuzy an Sam is heart warming.The actors are top notch.Wes Anderson out did himself.I hope he makes more like this one.I have a friend who met his wife in the 3rd grade.They were 8 years old.Today they are grandparents.this movie showes that love can bloom at any age.Wes Anderson is genious at movie making.Five stars.Inez
5,A Celebration of Life,"This quirky film gushes with charm. It is a love story with awkward but charming moments of two misfit children tasting the forbidden fruits for the first time. It is an adventure story with a feel that reminds me of My Father's Dragon. Most of all, it is a story that informs us of the beauty of the human experience."
4,Mood Movie,"Wes Anderson has a great sense of place and humor. His characters are at best described as ""quirky"" which adds to the fun. That said while his movies are memorable you have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy them. There is a lot of nuance and subtlety that can be hard to appreciate when you are watching a movie at home and are tempted to do something else in front of the TV. But if you can make a quiet space for yourself this movie with reward you."
1,Poor video quality.,"The video quality was so poor I couldn't stand to watch it. Way out of focus. The film wasn't compelling enough for me to want to get past the poor quality, so I can't really review the film in a fair way."
1,Trying hard to be quirky and witty,"I watched this movie because it had a 94% rating from Rotten Tomatoes, which I had never seen for any other movie before. Let me be very frank here: this is the type of movie you would expect from some untalented french director who thinks he is an artistic genius. This movie is not witty, nor funny, nor smart nor are the characters likeable, interesting or quirky. Moonrise Kingdom is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, primarily because the viewer is acutely aware every minute of the movie that the people behind it were trying hard to create Oscar material. Moonrise Kingdom is a waste of time and money, and not even Bill Murray can change that."
1,Review of cd's and movie,"I like anything by Steve Tyrell - wish he made more cd's. Also, like all the American Songbook cd's by Rod Stewart. The Christmas cd got bad reviews in the paper, but I liked it. As for Moonrise Kingdom - my son recommended it, and I thought it was just kooky. Saw in today's paper it's up for an award for I think original screenplay. Just my opinion!"
5,oscar?,"although they are saying possibility of an oscar nomination, i don't think it's a ""big"" enough movie. but it was sooo good on the big screen, when you could really see the right-on details of the 60s. great plot, interesting, quirky characters, clever original script, interesting ""feel"", interesting and beautiful backgrounds. a really good movie, but not for those who want big budget special effects"
4,:),"Eye-candy of a movie, with a sweet storyline. Loved the way the movie was framed and shot, and the actors and script fit perfectly. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
4,A quirky and delightful comedy!,"A sweet and romantic tale with just the right amount of quirkiness. The movie was about 90 minutes long and the time flew by. Moonrise Kingdom is a ""Fargo light""."
2,Thought it was a silly movie.,"Good actors playing silly characters, thought they should have known better. Maybe this is just one of the esoteric movies, and I just didn't get it. What was the plot? What was the moral? I didn't get it."
3,Quirky pleasantness,"I'm not a member of the Wes Anderson bandwagon. I've seen nearly all of his films, and I've enjoyed all of them. The Royal Tenenbaums was his magnum opus. But I would never call them great films. I like the offbeat, lighthearted feel of them, but they never stand for anything. I think they explore what it's like to be a moody, cerebral person in an age that lacks a defining conflict or purpose. That's all well and good, but it's not great."
2,Stupid,Movie chosen because of the great actors but they must have really been hard up for work to do this movie
2,Moonrise Kingdom,Moonrise Kingdom was not interesting to me in any way. It could not keep my attention. I fell asleep out of boredom.
3,Great Movie,I did not like the part when the little dog died. The movie could have done without that. But a really great movie overall.
3,Moonrise Mediocre,"Story line and characters were unusually interesting.Was a little disturbed over seeing a young girl dressed scantily and in a sexual manner, as well as 2 young people engaged in something they knew nothing of."
5,Quirky and wonderful!,"Only Wes Anderson could weave together such a seamless tapestry of wonder, imagination and creative twists and turns. The narrative is illustrated masterfully with myriad compelling visual and psychological elements. I kept flashing back to Fantastic Mr. Fox as the story unfolded (another Wes Anderson favorite). The cast and direction were flawless. A true creative masterpiece!"
4,Good,"With all the actor in this and Bruce Willis I thought it would be real good as it turned out it was just ok , a bit fractured for my taste."
1,What a Disappointment,"I rented this film because it featured several of my favorite actors - Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand.It turned out to be a colossal waste of talent. The basic plot - two pre-teen kids run away when they fall into mindless infatuation - could have been interesting, but the screenplay fell far short of the basic premise and the two lead child actors were simply awful. Could-not-act. Truly painful to watch.As for Anderson's directing, he doesn't seem to know whether he wants to be John Waters or a kiddie-porn anime director. How this film ever garnered enthusiastic reviews simply befuddles me."
1,Not My Kind Of Movie,"I thought this movie would have some interest for me when I rented it. I did not even finish watching it, because it just wasn't my kind of movie."
1,Didn't get the point of the movie,"Well, obviously this movie isn't for me. I couldn't care less for it. Looks like some people who get the movie like it. Suffice to say, it's not for everyone."
1,Less than Magical Snooze-dom,"I avoided this in the cinema and then was chided by a friend that I followed the ""If there's a heavy advertising campaign, avoid the film"" self-imposed rule. Oh, if I had only followed my instinct. This is a waste of time. It's hard to imagine that so much production value was put into something that had so little going for it: just a plain old bad script and horribly understated acting."
5,Moonrise Kingdom,Can't wait to watch it again! Great cast and lovable characters kept me interested all the way through the movie!
3,Good Movie?,"This movie came highly recommended, but I really didn't like it that much. It's okay but I really didn't see what all the fuss was about."
2,Not What I Expected,"Found it rather boring. Kids spoken word was a little garbled and low. Very strange content and characters, not my style."
2,Creative but disturbing,"I enjoy Wes Anderson's creative filming and directing and that's evident here. Love the khaki scouts and Bill Murray's character; I wish he had more of a presence. I found the 12-year-old troubled tween lovers disturbing, though. And if you're an animal lover, warning: a dog is killed in one awful scene."
3,Moonrise Kingdom A FIVE - Amazon Streaming Quality ZERO,"Moonrise Kingdom is a fantastic visual experience that does not deserve the poor picture quality of Amazon's streaming service. We paid $5 for the HD version, not only was it not HD, it was worse than SD. I got a headache trying to focus my eyes on the pixelated images. I stream excellent HD quality movies with Netflix, so I don't know what Amazon's problem is,"
2,"Great movie, low quality of streaming video detracted significantly",Moonrise Kingdom is a great movie. The artistry and precision of the scenes constructed by Wes Anderson have always been fantastic. The low quality of the image in the streaming Amazon video were disappointing and distracted from the movie significantly. I won't likely make future purchases.
2,Not my style...,I guess this movie is not my style. Neither my husband or I enjoyed it. It was entertaining in some areas but I guess we were expecting more of a comedy and it was hard to tell where exactly the storyline was headed. We both fell asleep and didn't bother to watch the end. It is very artsy and some of the shots were gorgeous. The costumes & sets were great to see.
2,No great,"I didn't think this movie was nearly as funny as some of his others, and the quirkiness just seemed contrived. I really likes movies like The Royal Tennenbaums and Bottle Rocket, but this one just isn't worth it."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I am tired of buying movies and not watching half of it. Movie was awful and stupid,2nd time in one week."
5,great movie,"This movie is shot very creatively, moves along at a nice pace, and delivers in every way. Very quirky which was expected from Wes Anderson. Short but sweet!"
5,Quirky and sweet,"This was one of the quirkiest movies I've ever seen. Well acted, beautifully shot and sweet story. I recommend it. You'll Enjoy!"
5,Love this Movie!,"This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It was very nostalgic for me, I loved the actors in it and the story!"
4,Quirky but likeable,"Great cast and a fun little story. Very much an independent film. Not for kids, though. If you liked Little Miss Sunshine, you'll like this one."
5,Favorite Wes Anderson film,"People often complain that Wes Anderson films are too pretentious. While that may be true, Moonrise Kingdom doesn't suffer from it. The movie, about the naivety, adventurousness and rebelliousness of children, is something that many can relate to. It has a beating heart that sets it apart from his other films. As usual, his cast of characters are odd and quirky, but ultimately endearing. The child actors are perfectly cast and do a wonderful job. This is a movie that I can watch again and again and never get bored."
5,Excellent,A bizarre look into my marriage. My wife the bookworm and myself the over baked boy scout. Both social misfits. Both misunderstood but meaning no harm. LOL Loved it!
1,Boring and Indecent,"Quirky but not very funny. One scene with some child pono. I like the cast, but the script was not funny."
1,Turkey Bacon,The movie is more bs than turkey bacon...It was more awkward than a family vacation to a nudist colony.
1,Poorest excuse for a movie I've seen since Ishtar...,"This made my top 10 list of worst movies ever created, and I would give it zero stars if Amazon allowed it. It got great reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, and I have no earthly idea why. The plot was slow and pointless.We fast-forwarded to the ending just out of sheer morbid curiosity. What a train wreck. If I had purchased the physical DVD I would use it for target practice. There goes 90 minutes of my life I can never get back."
1,Bizarre,"Even with some great actors, this movie is bizarre. The plot centers around two misfit children who run away and fall in love. Should twelve year-olds be involved in such an intimate relationship? I think not."
1,boring,I was very bored throughout the film. I felt like some of the actors were good but the film was boring. Not my preference.
4,Fresh new different great stuff,"Being a movie nut, 2 or more per day due to injury to my back.....I'm pretty hard on movies shows etc,I must say being a father of 10 7 of which are girls this movie is a great fit between parents teens and below. Done in a play type film it brings a Quentin Tarantino style of film rated for family. A must see and well worth the money."
4,Entertaining,"Moonrise Kingdom was a very entertaining movie with quite a cast. The humor in my opinion was sometimes hidden but that's one of the things that made it a better movie. The plot will bring you back to thinking the way you thought as a kid and without spoiling anything in the movie, this also added to the value of making it a video to watch over again.One of my criteria for a good film is if I would watch it over again and I definitely would with this video."
5,The perfect film.,Did you not read the title? Need I say more? I am not getting paid to do this. Buy it.
4,Wes Anderson's best movie since Rushmore,"Just watched this last night and thought that this is Wes Anderson's best work since Rushmore. Bill Murray is great, as always, and Edward Norton is terrific. The two kids who play the main characters are amazing. Kara Hayward is particularly outstanding and I look forward to seeing her in more movies.I've seen all of Wes Anderson's movies and Moonrise Kingdom, Rushmore, and Bottle Rocket are the only ones that I think are really good."
5,Hearth warming and sweet,"This was such a fun movie. It's a sweet, nostalgic, and offbeat flick with an all-star cast. If you're looking for a feel-good experience, this is the movie for you. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."
5,Sweet and quirky,"This film is not for everyone, and I know several people who would probably label this film as ""weird."" But if you're a Wes Anderson fan, you won't be disappointed. Excellent story and script. Excellent cast and acting. One scene was a tad disturbing for me and my friends, but otherwise, this is a sweet film with laughs and thoughtful moments. I loved it."
4,loving another wes anderson creation,Once again from the creative mind of Wes Anderson comes a cinematic wonderland of visuals and perfectly timed genious comedic quips. A must watch film!!!!!!!!
5,Wes Anderson's Love story,"If you have never seen a Wes Anderson film before, you might not like this movie. His films are always off-kilter and have interesting, strange characters and plots.Excellent visually and the score is great. Bruce Willis is fantastic."
2,Not much there,The best part of this movie can be seen by watching the movie trailer - very disappointed in movie particlulary given the actors.
2,Not our type of movie!,This just isn't an entertaining movie. It wasn't funny. I have no idea why they made this movie. It was a waste of time!
2,A weird show,"Not at all what we expected, it is a weird spoof. No-one in this movie is ""normal"". It is a mystery why there were big names in this movie."
3,Not Wes Anderson's best,Not as interesting as his other movies. Watchable if you like his movies. My friends liked it more than I did.
2,Such a waste of time. Sigh.,Brilliant? Miraculous? Nonsense. This movie is a complete waste of time and I wish I had my hour and a half back--which actually felt like about four hours. These kids could not act their ways out of a paper bag. Everything that is wrong with the movie industry today--right there for your viewing. Ugh. Save yourself the pain of having to sit thought this one.
2,Quirky,"A very odd, somewhat pointless ramble through a phase out of two children's lives. At times funny, but mostly not."
2,Quirky for Quirky's Sake.,"It's a cute film, but a trifling, insignificant one. Loaded with talent -- Norton; Willis; McDormand; Murray.....all of whom are kinda window dressing on a story of a goofy scout, and his serious-acting girl crush, who run away together. Charming as the two kiddie-leads may be, I can't recommend it......a quirky film that I had almost forgotten having seen once the credits rolled."
2,Boring and weird,"Don't know why this is so highly rated. Yeah, the child actors did great but Bruce Willis and Ed Norton? Weird, disturbed characters that added nothing to their previously stellar resumes. I'm sick of ""sweet stories of teenage angst and love"" that make it ok to run away from home and engage in pubescent intimacy and authorize adultry. Academy Award potential? You've got to be kidding!"
2,Eck...,Could NOT get into this movie....sorry I rented it...didn't watch the whole thing...do not recommend it....confusing...and odd...rented it for the actors but was disappointed
3,"Okay, not great",I found that this movie just did not live up to the crtics' 94%. I would give it about 60. Liked the set. I did not care for the acting (or lack of) and was not impressed by all the big named actors.
4,Sweet and mild,I very much enjoyed the dynamic between the lead children liked the way the adult leads let them own the film.
3,Average,"Pretty boring for such a great cast. Ultimately my wife walked away from it after about 45 minutes, I finished but to no real satisfaction. Just plain boring."
4,Library Science made funny,"Will Manley is the Dave Barry of the library world. His essays and other books are exceedingly funny and poingant. I salute any and all public librarians like Mr. Manley...truly the salt of the earth, our Republic is blessed by men & women like this."
3,CS2 Center Channel,Speaker is larger than I expected. Beautiful Cherry Finish. Speaker works better than I expected. I haven't really had a chance to run it on a wide range of music.
1,Don't buy this book if you're not jewish,"I bought this book because I genuinely want to learn Hebrew. I bought a few books from Amazon and this was one of them. The other books were great; this one, not so much! Sure, the book teaches you the alphabet. But, under each letter, the book lists a bunch of random Hebrew words with NO transliteration and no pronunciation guide. So you are left to wonder whether you pronounced or even read the words correctly. This books assumes that everyone learning Hebrew is jewish and has knowledge of the Torah. Therefore, if you're not jewish, like me, you are left to wonder what the words you just read mean and even wonder if what you read was read correctly. Do not buy this book. Terrible investment."
4,Exellent learning xperiance.,"This book has given me an edjucation of the basik hebrew ABC's. you really neeed it!!! Although not clear on how to make the gutteral sound of the chaf, I highly reccomend this book for beginners. it made me smart?"
5,Easy to understand and follow.,This book was exactly what I was looking for. It is for those who attend synagogue services and hear the blessings but can't read the prayer book. I can now follow along in the prayer book and I am working on my first Aliyah in Hebrew.
1,I don't understand how anyone would review this positively,"I purchased this product because, in my haste, I confused it forHebrew in 10 Minutes a Day, which I rented from a library and took with me on Birthright (don't tell the library).""Hebrew in 10 minutes"" is a practical guide to conversational hebrew, structured to help readers associate hebrew words with the idea or action they mean. ""Learn Hebrew Today"" is the epitome of decades of awful language instruction. Its the very icon of language instruction based on the ridiculous notion that showing someone a page of foreign text with no context or even translations will make them suddenly think like a native.If I'm coming across strong, its because I suffered through 9 years of hebrew classes under the assumption that I wasn't good at languages before discovering that most language programs are as sensible as reading a stereo manual to a classroom aloud and then telling them they should all know how to build a radio."
3,A good primer but needs work,This was my first introduction to Hebrew and I enjoyed it very much. The problem with the book is it is a very basic introduction which doesn't offer much in the way of explanation. Some of the words used were not translated to English and the pronunciation guide could use expanding to aid the student in understanding.
2,sad stuff,"I hate to write anything bad about the irrepressible music and spirit of the great Meade Lux Lewis, but anyone interested in blues and boogie piano should look for other recordings than this one. Lewis plays a terrible quasi-honky-tonk piano and he is accompanied by an anonymous guitar player and a bassist, who seem to be sleeping on the job. The overall idea behind this recording seems to be to capture Lewis' music as some kind of an 'oldie' thing, which is as far from the truth as you can come.If you want to hear vintage Lewis - which is truly awesome - check out the recordings from 1939-1941, or The Blues Piano Artistry of Meade Lux Lewis (1961) instead."
4,The First Must Have CD Of Fall !,"I'll keep this short. I've been a fan since ""A Beautiful World"". By the way If you don't have ""A Beautiful World"" you should pick it up ASAP. Track 2&4 are my favorite. I think the only misstep was the track with Lil Wayne, but the rest of the cd is so good it makes up for it.The Music and tracks really flows. This is a must have cd."
1,Why isnt there 0 stars.,"This album and singer is beyone awful. Listening to it is so physically painful that my ears literally bleed after a couple minutes of his high pitch squeeling and screeching. He sounds like a castrated boy from the tabernacle choir. I saw him on American Idol as a guest singer, and listened to some more of his music, because I figured he cant be as horrible as he was on the show, but he proved me wrong. Its like trying to listen to Justin Timberlake imitate Prince imitating Michael Jackson imitating a 12 year old boy."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"WOW - this has to be one of the worst cds i've ever heard! I was SO dissapointed by this artist - based on the reviews i had read and knowing his dads work - I expected SO much more! This cd makes Michael Jackson look over the top BUTCH!!!!!!! Its wimpy, wispy and beyond efeminate. i cant even find anyone to GIVE this thing too! Sadly - this cd is an F in my book"
3,Not for mature audiences.,"Good music is ageless. ""Youngster"" is written all over this. But I did enjoy ""Everything I Can't Have"". Whoever said this guy is the new Marvine Gaye is WRONG!"
1,Dumb Dumb Dumb,This is some of the worst music I have ever heard . I just can't believe what passes for talent these days. Really stupid lyrics and a ridculous voice. Woody Allen has more soul. I guess growing up with rich actor parents in malibu is what shapes the soul of a man these days! lol !
1,Oh Brother,I-Yi-Yi-Yi - this is awful. Are we now just a society that accepts anything that comes down the pike? I asked my husband to sing up high like this guy and he sounded just like him and my husband can't sing a note! This is just pure commercialism at its worst. You're all being taken for a ride here. Are you really hearing this because if you are; how on earth could you possibly like this. This is embarrassing for a grown man to be singing in this style...he's awful.
5,WHAT AN EVOLUTION!!,"I bought this CD after seeing the video for ""Lost without you"" and I absolutely love it. I have a copy in the house as well as in my car. I think this CD is very well done and has something for everyone. I can listen to it over and over again."
4,Beautiful,This is a wonderful album. If you're a fan of neyo soul and smooth r&b; you will fall in love with this record. Robin Thicke's voice will sooth and relax you on some of the slower tracks. The upbeat tempos are sure to get you on your feet. Robin is all about making good music. This is a fantastic buy. Highly recommended.Favorite tracks:1. I Need Love2. Would That Make U Love Me3. Ask Myself4. Shooter5. Complicated6. Teach U A Lesson
5,MUST HAVE,"I got this Cd last week and I can't stop listening to it, there are those relaxing songs and then songs you can't stop singing in your head!"
4,Interesting,Trying to get used to this artist and thought I would try someone different. Some good songs and I enjoy listening to the relax sounds of Robin. I would recommend this album for about 70% of the songs.
5,Ask Myself,"when i first heard of robin, i had just heard ""wanna love you girl"" and i was thinking, ""who on earth put this loud *** song together, ohmygoodness!"" then i heard ""lost without you"", which is what made me purchase the album on itunes, and now i can't get enough. i even listened to ""wanna love you girl"" a couple more times.my faves: (in no particular order, actually, i fight with myself over which one i should play first... put the ipod on shuffle and let it decide, lol)1. ask myself (i think some men i know need to write down these lyrics and keep them in their pocket)2. 2 the sky & angels(....what else is there to say that others haven't already?)3. got 2 be down (try not to bob your head to that)4. teach you a lesson (mmm mmm mmm)5. lost without you (all the things guys should (wanna?) say... but don't.)thank you so much for putting together an album that i can listen to from start to finish. much appreciated."
5,Smooth and soulful,"The smooth soulful sounds of this gifted artist and his honest introspective lyrics sparkle like a precious jewel amoung the broken glass of todays, tired, tunes."
4,Evolution of R&B,"Robin thicke is a fresh voice in R&B. Not just blue-eyed soul, he brings something new to R&B. he's a versatile singer who can bring on the strong falsetto but still take it all the way home with something slow. I bought initial for the radio track ""lost without u"" but I have come to love the cd as a whole. Its got a little something for everyone. Some very nice slow jams and a couple of tracks that will lead right to the dance floor. One of my favorite tracks is ""all night long"" with lil wayne. But the final track Angels, well let's just say it gets even better at night. The whole album is a jam and so much fun. If you see me driving along lake Shore Drive singing, I'm probably listening to Robin Thicke."
4,Better than I thought,Although there are a couple of songs that use adult language I am pleased with the album. I would recommend it if you like this type of music.
5,A Unique Musician...,"I came across Robin Thicke when I saw him once on the Ellen Show. I can honestly say that I do not remember the song he sang, but it left an indelible memory. I decided, based on that one song, to take a chance and purchase his CD, and I must admit, he is an amazing singer. It really is a shame that many are comparing him to Justin Timberlake. Don't get me wrong... Justin is also a great singer, however, they're two entirely different, gifted singers in their own right. I say this because I own both CD's, and I enjoy listening to them both, however, I find myself listening to Robin's CD much more that Justin's. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but Robin Thicke is Not imitating anyone, for he is a unique performer. I recommend his CD Highly. I promise, you will not be disappointed..."
4,A Great Evolution!,"This album is HOT! He has a great voice and the music didn't just enchanced it. This songs are timeless. Its one of those pop it in and go cds. Buy this, you won't be disappointed."
4,"Good, but it's too bad it got chopped and recut","Well, this is certainly a step forward for Thicke. Sure, you can complain that it's a little more pop influenced, but that also means that this release is more polished, and I personally loved his first attempt, but was left with the feeling that it was too raw, and this one is much more focused. My only complaint is that the studio decided to cut half the tracks and replace them, which is what took them so long to get this one out. I have the ""advance"" copy of this one, and it is incredible. It's really too bad they switched out ""superman"" ""Would That Make U Love Me"" ""u center me"" and ""Spend the Night With Me"". If you can find them, you will see the perfect blend of Thicke's raw talent and some polished producing. Had they released the original version of this album, it would have won a grammy. sad"
3,Soothing love music,I absolutely loved one or two of the songs but I found the album as a whole a bit bland. I did not really see the evolution but I do not know his earlier music.
3,Yea,"I had this album, then it was lost then i got it again then broken & bottom line is this album is good but while good doesn't hold a candle to SEX THERAPY!"
5,Robin Thicke Evolution,"This was a good investment for me and Amazon.com made it a quick and smooth transaction.Thank you,Christine Maldonado"
5,Can't stop listening to this album,This album is absolutely amazing! There are so many songs that could be hit records. Buy this album you won't be disappointed!
5,This is Why It's HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!,"* 2 The Sky* Angels* I Need Love* Can U Believe* Everything I Can't Have* Lost Without U* Shooter* Complicated* Would That Make U Love Me* Teach U A Lesson* Got 2 Be Down* Wanna Love U Girl* Ask MyselfNuff Said!!! Dont sleep on this, I'm telling you it's HOT!!!! Justin Timber Who???P.S.Actually I have much more to say on this Masterful piece of work. Amazon kept asking me to review it and I can't seem to find the time to sit down and truly elaborate. So this is my place keeper for when I'm ready."
3,A bit more sexier,"This album is a bit more sexier than the last one. Lyrics of some songs I though was just too much about sex, but sound of the album was very cool."
2,It's ok,"I did not fall in love with this album like everyone else. It's ok. I still can't listen to the whole album because I find myself dozing off. If you're looking for an artist that was slept on last year with a great album, then you need to listen to Raheem Devaughn's album."
4,Music Talent Beyond Words,"This CD was way more than I expected! I know Robin comes from GREAT genes, but his talent reflects the best of both of his worlds. His Mom and Dad. A MUST!"
5,THIS IS A GREAT CD,This CD is great. All of the songs on the cd have a different feel. If you do not have this one you need to get it. This was worth every penny I spent on it.
4,CD Vocal Work is Tight,I am impressed with the CD falsetto vocals. Mid-low range is weak. I assume his falsetto is as smooth live as it sounds on CD. Doubtful.
3,Robin Thicke's Evolution CD - Only Liked Half,"Robin Thicke is talented vocally and lyrically, unlike other people who sell CDs but cannot sing or people who write songs with incredibly boring, repetitive lyrics (i.e., Justin Timberlake). I like Robin's voice, but didn't like about half of this CD. Also, I thought the track about the ""school girl"" was in poor taste, given the focus on pedophiles and inappropriate advances by teachers toward students that have hit the news in the last five years. Would recommend CD to others with ""conditions."" Even so, I do like Robin Thicke and hope his fronting on tour for Beyonce goes well."
3,It was alright,Songs seems old like some of the songs were written a while ago and now they are just being released with fresher music. The album was ok but not great. He definitely has a style I just think it's to played out for me.
2,Evolution in the wrong direction,"Thicke's first CD entitled Beautiful World was a great CD. Timeless in my opinion. I can understand his reasons for moving in the direction he did with this new CD; however, I just feel it lacks the rawness, hooks and tempo of his previous effort. His song writing skills are great, but this is not was I hoping for with this CD."
4,false advertisement,"you should buy the cd because robin thicke cannot sing in real life. just go to one of his concerts and you will clearly see what i am talking about. if you want to keep the warm and fuzzy feeling you get when you listen to his cd, do not go see him live. it will ruin everything."
2,Soul What?,"I've listened to this CD and unless you're deaf, dude should just keep writing and producing. His voice is whiny and has no depth. ugh"
1,Just awful!,"I don't get why this guy is receiving such raves -- I've only heard two songs, both sung in a falsettto, little-girl voice that is extremely unpleasant to listen to. I think that if his name weren't Thicke, he could't possibly have gotten into the business. No personality and no soul. Amazing that he's being so favorably received!"
3,It's Not Raw Enough (2.5 Stars),"""Evolution of Robin Thicke"" is alright- when you listen to it a couple of times. After that, it just becomes one of those CDs you sell at the Used CD store because whatever little magic it had is gone and now it's just taking up space on your CD rack. Something is missing in Robin's music. When I listen to a song I want to feel some kind of emotion rushing through me and that's what I think his music is lacking. The voice is there, the R&B beat is there, but there's a lack of passion and excitement in his voice. Not enough melodies or up-tempo songs either. Robin's voice is just *okay*. If Michael Jackson and El Debarge are his influences, that's great, but he shouldn't imitate their vocalizations too closely. And I swear on ""Lonely World"" Robin sounds like Justin Timberfake. Overall, these songs are okay but they don't stand out. I can't even see at least *one* song becoming a classic hit."
5,Relax and chill....,"The Evolution of Robin Thicke is a very smooth, laid back venture into the stylings of Mr. Thicke. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Also, you can hear his various influences, ranging from Marvin Gaye to Prince."
5,Simply Irresistible,"Now, I purchased Justin Timberlake's album when it first came out and I highly anticipated it. I even purchased his concert tickets. However, I listened to The Evolution of Robin Thicke a few times and I have to say that the album is just as good or even better than Justin Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveSounds. Robin Thicke didn't have to SexyBack or My Love all over the place and kept it smooth and slow and the album is still incredible. Tracks 1-12 are all amazing. Also, Robin Thicke, in my opinion, deserves a lot of credit because instead of running to Pharrell or Timbaland like JT does and did, he produced or co-produced all of the tracks on The Evolution. He deserves all the props in the world ... and he's just 2 soulful 2 be white."
5,**BEST VINYL I HAVE EVER PURCHASED** RARE GEM!,"This is perhaps one of the SEXIEST, most ROMANTIC vinyls I have ever bought.Anytime a lady friend comes over, I whip over to THIS product and let it go. Every single song is an absolute BABY MAKER.The sound is crisp and the product is in excellent order. The cover art is sharp and the vinyl itself is beautifully constructed.PLEASE buy this item if you can afford it, it will be a classic and a MUST have in anyone's collection.**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRODUCT**Pros:+Beautiful sound+great price+Very RareBonus: +Ladies love Robin ThickeCons:- NonePLEASE PLEASE purchase this item, ridiculous how brilliant this album was and IS. Also check out Mayer Hawthorne, too!A Strange Arrangement"
4,An Evolution of Epic Proportions,"Robin Thicke first caught my attention with his first single ""Wanna Love You Girl"" featuring Pharrell. The song was so hot and catchy! I absolutey loved it. That set the stage for me as far as anticipating his album was concerned. I was not impressed initially upon my first listen. Initially I picked the album back up (overtime) and realized how good it was. The album along with Robin's voice is very mellow and soothing. It's a nice album to ride too. It's a breath of fresh air to me. This album is definitely for anyone who wants to hear something different. This is not anything like Omarion, Mario, or other teen male acts. This is grown folks music! My favorite songs from this album are: Complicated, All Night Long, Teach U A Lesson, Can't Believe, I Need Love, etc. Definitely recommended!"
3,I was not feeling it!,"Man, I dunno. I was not feeling the album! I think Thicke lost me on some of the songwriting and production. It sounded like an enhanced demo. I blame Star Trak. Yes, I know that creative control is what most important to an artist, but I thought Chad and Pharrell could of enhanced the album production wise (""wanna love you girl"" sounded like it was thrown together). I give it to Thicke though he has a beautiful voice and his falsetto is panty dropping! I love the fact that he sings about his wife! I respect him for attempting to put soul back into r & b. I could tell his songwriting is testimonial (like mary j) and not embellished songwriting that have no point or morals to the song. Lost without you is beginning to register as one of my favorit songs of all time. I hope his evolution will cause #3 to be a better album."
3,Robin Thicke's Got A Love Jones,"I like ""Evolution"", but the delays and the lack of up-tempo party musicthat he came up with on ""Beautiful World"" leaves this album in limbo.""Wanna Love You Girl"" is a hot gem but since we've all heard waaay beforeit's release- it doesn't fit here anymore. ""Oh, Shooter""...yeah RIGHT"".Not sure why that was added. So for me there are a good 9 tracks thatget my vote and the rest is puzzling. My faves so far are ""Complicated"",""Cocaine"" and ""Teach U A Lesson."" Two more points: You don't have to beblack to sing soul music. Robin is a great vocalist and is right on parwith Maxwell. Two: I think Robin is a hot looking guy but I miss seeinghim rock a longer hairstyle ;)"
5,smooth sound,"i saw robin thicke open for john legend and decided to buy this cd after the concert. he sounds as good or better than the popular neo-soul artists out there. i like his voice and he sings with passion (something you don't always get these days). he's talking about ""grown man"" things which i enjoy hearing instead of childish, weal lyrics. i wish his music would get more radio play and his video would get more time on bet/mtv but until then i'll jam this one. my favorite...lost without you....but it's all good. it could really set the mood for a lovely evening!!!"
5,Great Service,I ordered 4 items at the same time - this was the first to arrive and it was in excellent condition.
4,classic,"i bought his first cd and there's no comparison. i listened to this cd everyday when i first purchased it, now it's in rotation in my stero at home. can't wait for his third cd."
5,ALRIGHT!!!,"Anticipated his first album and when it dropped, didn't like but two songs. Anticipated this album and he did not disappoint this time. This cd is what Blue Eyed Soul is all about. This disc is essential to today's new R&B; movement.Check it out for yourself."
5,Exceptional !,"I know good music just like I know good fiction novels. Whoever helped produce this album put their foot in it. A beautiful combination of Robin's soft smooth voice, and dynamite lyrics. The WHOLE CD is banging! I actually like every song, which does not happen much. I am sitting in my room listening to his beautiful voice and rereading; This Can't Be Love! by Patricia Goins. This book was the BOMB! Get this CD and that book. You will see what I'm talking about!"
5,Robin Thicke is refreshing,I absolutely love this cd! I bought it last week off of Amazon and have been telling all my friends about it. I would recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys listening to fresh sounds. His music does not make you feel like you've heard his songs somewhere before.I'm in love with Robin Thicke!
2,not what it seems,post was only a plastic shaft..............from the measurements[70 inches] it gave the impression it went into the ground. it only slides over a wooden spike.No better than what I had.disappointing for the money.
1,Piece of Junk,"The only thing positive I can say about this is that it is a quick way to get a replacement mailbox put up without digging a hole. Other than that, this is maybe worth $20, but that's about it. It is very flimsy when installed, and wobbles when you open and close the mailbox. The screw caps do not snap over the screws like they are supposed to (maybe if you glue them). Honestly, this is a piece of junk that might last a year. Very disappointed!!!"
2,Rubbermaid Post,"One wood 2x4 inserted in a 4x4 plastic post does not make a sturdy final product. The mailbox wobbles easily. Eventually, this is going to come out of the ground and fall over."
2,Not the best....,"I just bought this post and be aware that this mailbox post/plate/stake requires a lot of work beforehand. It must be pre-drilled first of all, to attach the stake AND the plate to the plastic post. The plastic post is rather flimsy and I think the price is inflated for this product. (I bought this for $5 less.)"
1,This is not for 6 months and over!,"Purchased this item for my 7 month old who is in the 90th percentile for height. I mention the height because even as long as he is he could not use this roller when inflated all the way as the intructions suggest. And the item did not perform as described once deflated to the point he could safely lay on top of it to help ""encourage crawling"" as the box describes. When I fully inflated it and he was laying on top of it the roller slipped forward on carpeting and my child hit the carpet face first and was crying for awhile then wanted little to do with the roller afterward. If you want any indication of what size or age child this roller is appropriate for look at the box and the child that looks about 2 to 3 yrs of age. By that time when they look to be the age of the child on the box do they really need somthing like this?!?!? At the very least CHICCO needs to relabel this learning toy approprately! I will be complaining to them directly!Chicco Musical Roller"
3,The good and the bad,"A friend of ours bought this for our son who is eight months old now. I just ordered our third one. He LOVES to crawl after it and play with it. It truly is one of his favorite toys. However, if you are too rough (which doesn't take much) with them, they seem to start loosing air. So, it is definitely a winner for my son, but loser because it seems to break easily. This will be my last one!"
2,Meh.,"It's fine. Possibly my kiddo just wasn't interested but he'll get very excited when I present it to him, accept it, shake it a few times, roll it around then in about 5 minutes or less he's done with it.He was looking through the clear window at his Dad a few nights ago and that induced some really awesome giggles. The little musical chip has worn down to some sort of creepy, haunted house-esque, horror movie, broken music box sound and it has been played with, literally, less than 20 times.I suppose it just depends on the kid but my son didn't go for it."
2,Would Be Fun if it Would Hold Air,I purchased this toy on Amazon for my grandson because my kids had them when they were babies & they loved it. I found it cheaper at a toy store & returned it to amazon because they wouldn't match the cheaper price. It was kind of a hassel to return even with they're 1 year toy return policy but after several phone calls I got a full credit to my account .I guess they're not as durable as they were back then & the windows to see the balls & bells inside are not as big . He was only 6 mos. old & only played with it a few times in the house on carpet but after a few times it started to go flat so not as durable as it needs to be . He did seem to enjoy it when it held air & I'm sure if it was of better quality it would be a great toy for baby as it stimulates movement & motor skills .
3,"It's OK, not great","My 7-month old likes to touch it, but he doesn't really play with it. It is OK, not too much fun."
4,'The Commodification of the Psyche',"The World of Consumption is a really fantastic book. It explains modern consumption theory on everything from food to advertising. It is the most complete book on the subject I have encoutered through many years of research. The only difficultly one might have is that it is laden with theory. If one does not have a good background in modern theory (from Marx to Baudrilliard), then the excellent ideas in this book are difficult to understand."
4,Funny yet cautious novel,"No More Mr. Nice Guy may have you laughing yet feeling cautious. Laughing because it is funny when a normally conservative guy decides he wants to learn how to become a 'dog' so he can score with the women. But it's not as if he wants all women, just one particular one named Nikki, a female who doesn't seem interested in Mitchell until he shows her a different side.The caution, though, comes when the reader sees the consequences and drama that may ensue when a man makes a choice to be reckless in his dating/relationships. Using hip dialogue, relationship analysis, and fairly presenting both sides of the issues regarding male and female relationships, this novel should make a connection with both men and women.There are tons of characters in the book so you have to make sure and keep up, however the story pace is fast, the male antics are funny, and the end resolution is suitable in this charming and commendable novel from C. Kelly Robinson."
3,Not fantastic but okay,This was a kind of humdrum read about the dating scene. It could have been better if there were more plot twists and turns.I thought this story was a little underdeveloped. It was like that same old dating scene stuff but without any real excitement. So people take this one out of the library. Not one to add to your personal library.
3,NOT THAT BAD,"THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A GUY NAME MITCHELL WHO HAS NO LUCK WITH THE WOMAN IN HIS LIFE. HE STARTS TO THINK THAT ALL WOMEN WANT ARE MEN WHO ARE DOGS. SO HE GETS TWO OF THE BIGGEST DOGS IN TOWN TO TRAIN HIM, HE NOT ONLY BECOMES THE DOG THAT EVERY WOMAN WANTS HE GETS A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE WOMAN THAT HE WANTS. BUT HIS PLAYER WAYS MIGHT MAKE HIM LOOSE THE WOMAN HE WANTS ALONG WITH OTHER THINGS. THE BOOK IS OK BUT THE ENDING WAS NOT GOOD AT ALL."
3,It was more like 3 1/2 stars,"I was eagerly looking forward to reading this book but I was a tad bit disappointed.Mitchell Stone is your typical nice guy that can't find a decent woman no matter how hard he tries. Out of the blue he runs into Nikki, the girl that he had a crush on in high school. Nikki and Mitchell date but Mitchell wants to take the relationship to a higher level, meanwhile Nikki is just looking for someone to do the things that the other men in her life won't do.After a date with Nikki, Mitchell decides that a nice guy is not what the ladies want, he thinks that they want a dog. Mitchell decides to transform himself into a dog along with the help of friends.Mitchell didn't realize that being a dog comes with a price and Nikki realizes you don't miss what you have until it's gone.Overall this was a pretty good read, it just appeared to be superficial at times to me.."
4,...a good read...,"A give and take kind-of book that deals with the relationship between ""A Good"" man and the love of his life. NO MORE MR. NICE GUY is a little on the ""wordy"" side, but a good read non-the less. Written by a contemporary male author, it is astounding that Mr. Robinson was able to tap into the actions and minds of today's single black females with such accuracy. Mr. Robinson brings to light the old question, "" If women `claim' to want a good man, then why do they only date the bad boy-player type?""I would recommend this book to readers that enjoy peeking over the fence to see ""the grass on the other side."" Be prepared to see a lot of your actions and people you know in these pages.-WE"
2,No More Being Nice,"The cool thing about an airplane is that it takes off at great speed, but then it evens off a bit. It's wonderful because we're comfortable, and eventually we get somewhere. Unfortunately, those qualities are undesirable in a novel, especially in one with such a potentially great storyline as this one. It's even further dismaying when you don't get anywhere. The first couple of pages of No More Mr. Nice Guy are good, but after those, the fun stops and you're left with a bland writing style and page after page of characters that you feel no sympathy for. Some books you can't put down. Others make you want to stop being so nice and demand a refund."
2,Didn't Like this one,"Mitchell decides to become a player, thinking that he will get more women that way,because women seem to like that type of guy more so then a nice guy. Mitchell get lessons from all his player friends. The main lady who Mitchell wants is Nikki, a lady who has turned him down. When he becomes a player, he get's a lot of women, including the one that he wants most. I don't understand why Mitchell wanted Nikki, so bad- she had been around the block more then a couple of times, had one-night stands, but I guess that's what guy's like. I didn't really care for either one of the main character's, the only character is the book that I liked was Mitchell's brother."
2,This is a voice you will enjoy,"When I first heard this cd I thought I was listening to Anne Murray. Margie's voice has a very strong resemblance to Anne's voice. I think Margie's voice is a little bit better than Anne's.I bought this cd by accident, but i'm not sorry for this decision. This is a fairly enjoyable cd. It has some good songs and sidemen that perform on it. The main concern I have for this cd is the lack of enough what I would call ""great songs"". Most of the songs performed here are household names, but I would have preferred some other songs be performed for this project.I Would Like To Recommend This CD"
1,Total Crap,"Like the other reviews on the spill proof spout, this new technology is terribly complicated to use and is not very durable, easily broken. Much spillage of course while figuring out how to get the gas out. Would NEVER buy this product ever again, nor do business with this company."
5,great introductory,Good introductory to celtic healing. With the health care industry growing colder and less careing by the day It is good to explore other options. I think this book is good to read before you get sick. Hopefuly you can heal yourself befor you need corprate intervention.
5,A genuine pleasure read,This is a great book to read over a course of few delicious do-nothing days or in a dedicated sitting (or two)
3,"Works fine, but plugs are not snug","This does exactly what it's advertised to do - it converts a single outlet to a 3-outlet, and includes a built-in night light that shines only when it's dark.Two caveats, however:1) It doesn't hold items plugged into it very snugly.2) The bulge on the bottom means it may block a large plug (such as those for portable electronics that have large ""block"" plugs), which means you should plan on this being installed in the LOWER of a two-plug outlet."
1,Stopped working after 1 day,"After I plugged it in, it worked for one day. Now the light is completely dead. I would not buy this cheap product again."
5,One of the best,"As an avid S Trek fan, I have to say this is one of the best. Harris Yulin and Nana Visitor should have gotten awards for this episode. And the writing was excellent. This was like Shakespeare on TV. You just don't see this kind of thing."
2,don't always get what you pay for,"I've bought a number of publications on playing piano by ear and I can tell you right now that video series in not the greatest. though it was a fairly good tool showing the basics of listening and playing back. the same type of instruction can be found on some of the cheaper videos like ""Play Blues Piano by Ear."" I've found the the best way to learn is through some of the books which have been published on this topic. I recommend ""You Can Teach Yourself Piano by Ear"" for one thing, it's [inexpensive] and it goes over the same stuff that this video discusses just at 1/20 the price."
3,"relaxing, but still lacking","I felt that the description of this product was deceiving. It is actually a videotape produced for a college course. The first volume only covers basic stretching and deep breathing. I expected to delve into Kundalini Yoga in a more in depth way. It appears for me to get that, I would need to purchase all six volumes. Judging from the first, I don't think the whole set would be worth the $150.00. I did, however, find the stretching to be relaxing, beneficial, and done in good form...it just wasn't what I desired for my purchase."
4,Another good one!,"As with all the Dr. Steven Dunbar books, this one was a page turner. He has all the medical angst and mystery of a good Robin Cook without the weirdness. Like it!"
4,Another awesome book,This is my third Dunbar read and they keep getting better and more interesting! Looking forward to reading the next!
1,1984,"The words (Planeta Cero) kept bothering me. Thought it was the publisher. I just found out, too late..after it shipped, this book is printed in Spanish, not English. If the language is not English, it should be stated clearly on the main line near the title."
1,could not read it,Nowhere does it say this book is in Spanish. This was not what we wanted and was no way made clear that it wasn't in English like the other several books we ordered. We paid return shipping and still have seen no balance refund. We order alot from Amazon but this transaction was not fair.
3,A Wonderful Writer Weighted Down by an Insipid Genre,"Never read a book by Trevanian before, although I knew he had an ardent following and was fairly well regarded by critics. I spent a few days during vacation this summer reading Incident at Twenty Mile. Trevanian is certainly a wonderful writer. His writing and stylistic abilities are first rate and, based on this criterion alone, I would rate this book four or five stars. However, the story itself, while wonderful in its depiction of characters, eventually began to wane and lose my interest. I thought the ending a bit of a letdown and felt that, perhaps, Trevanian's attempt to write a Western genre book--while succedding remarkably well--suffered from the idiosyncratic failings of the genre formula. Wonderful writing, but not a great book."
1,Extremely derivative,"Trevanian uses this novel as a soap box for ugly and racist diatribes against all non-Aryans in America. Cruel and nearly pornographic in its violence, Trevanian clearly derives his protagonist, Hamilton Leider from Hannibal Lecter. This novel felt ""phoned in"". The supposed historical wrap-up defies belief by even Trevanian's most ardent fans. I have read all of his/her books & articles and was thrilled to see a new book after a decade long absence. I will no longer scour the bookshelves looking for future drivel from this source."
2,Disappointing,"Looks like a must have. Very slow, not compelling, too easy to put aside for something better. Not his best book."
4,"Really, really, really enjoyed this book.",I almost didn't buy it because in general I do not like Westerns. I enjoyed reading Shibumi so I thought I'd give this a try. While the story's setting is 100 years ago it brings out a lot of modern issues and the revenge is most satisfying. The book left me wanting to know more about the author and how much of this story was true. Now I am a true Trevanian fan and I must find his other books.
3,not the literary power I expected,"I can only give this book a lukewarm review. It has been some time since I last read a Trevanian book and I expected a gripping story. As the Publishers Weekly review states, once the head bad guy meets the young protagonist, ""the outcome is never in doubt."" That is sad. The only part of this story I found interesting is how the protagonist handled the showdown between himself and the head bad guy. By and large, the characters are interesting, but I don't feel that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
2,Not very interesting.,"Never really grabbed me. Doesn't make good use of the myths of the old west. Some good scenes toward the end. Reminds me of ""Welcome To Hard Times"" by E.L. Doctorow, which wasn't very good either. Doesn't have the scope and depth of Cormac McCarthy or the page-turner scmaltz of Louie L'Amour. I'd give it a C+."
5,Westerns don't get better than this.,"Trevanian's skill as a novelist has never been better showcased than this fascinating story from the American West. INCIDENT AT TWENTY-MILE is the story of a small, remote town in the Wyoming frontier in it's death throes Reminiscent of such heavyweight Westerns as Walter Van Tilberg Clark's THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, Stephen Crane's masterpiece THE BLUE HOTEL, and Thomas Berger's LITTLE BIG MAN, INCIDENT AT TWENTY MILE is brutally realistic with an eerie afterward that seems to draw the reader inward to the last days of the American frontier. Trevanian's control of incident , language, character, and reportage envelopes the book into one of those perfectly realized stories all authors hope to create. Magnificent!"
1,Awful!,"The western has already been rescued from the dustbin by other writers. What on earth inspired this calamity?Almost every character is repulsive, including the main protagonist. Later we sympathize for him a little, but that's about it for any humanity in this tale.The villain is another cartoon stereotype derived from our movies. The supporting cast ... you couldn't care less. The plot is somewhat mindless and predictable, so that the ""climax"" is perfunctory. Not that there's much plot to be had. Violence happens, willy-nilly and without much reference to the story as a whole, mainly for shock value here and there.Whatever Trevanian's experimental/artistic intentions, let this book serve as a warning: consider meat and potatoes first, style later."
4,great plot,"Maybe not the best writing but certainly the most captivating story line I've read in a while. The character studies are built well individually and I really became engrossed in the terrific, though fairly predictable, plot. Based on a true event? You decide."
4,An exceptional book for any genre,"I have been Travanian fan since ""the Eiger Sanction."" While he has not been a prolific writer with new titles delivered to his readers on an annual basis as many authors do, when he does deliver...HE DELIVERS! The book sets the story up efficiently and engagingly, and it never, ever falls into the ""mid story lull"" that many books do, when you get the feeling that the author is serving up filler. The ending seems to end with a bang and then...when you think he is wrapping up the book with a few cursory and perfuntory comments and references...then the real impact comes. The final relevation hits like the impact of punch that you don't see coming. Trevanian is Trevanian, and that very simply means that there is no writer today quite like him."
5,Great Western with the Trevanian touch and a twist,"Trevanian only issue books every 15 years or so now, so this is a rare treat. It has the usual Trevanian wit and character development, pulse-pounding suspense, and a great epilogue just when you thought the story was over."
1,"Uncompelling, boring - how to give zero stars?","This book has some similarities with ""Shibumi"" - the general anti-West/anti-American tone; the one-dimensional characters. But ""Shibumi"" was still interesting, whereas ""Incident"" is totally uncompelling after the first one-sixth of the book. The negative sermonizing and one-dimensionality are much more pronounced here, though, and really wear on the reader rather quickly. The story and setting are bleak and heartless.And an overdose of exclamation points, which gives a cartoonish quality to the book, although he seeks to ""recreate"" a fictional history. Although some dialogue is amusing, it's hard to recommend even one portion of this book as worth reading.If you liked this book, you probably won't mind Anne Rice's ""Servant of the Bones"" and other similar disasters."
3,A Good Read But Nothing Special,"Incident At Twenty-Mile is a western that has well-developed characters and an interesting plot. The story builds to a point where where you expect really a memorable ending. While the conclusion is satisfying, the author allows it to end much too quickly. All in all, the book is one you won't be sorry you read but it leaves you with a feeling of slight disappointment for not fulfilling all of the great expectations you had prior to reaching the end."
4,Old West Revisited,"Beautifully written by a wordsmith of the highest order, this dark, gritty, complex story pits youthful bravado against experienced evil in the Old West. The near-abandoned mining town of Twenty Mile Wyo. is the setting for a confrontation between the innocent townfolk, including: three prostitutes, a virgin, her family and Matthew Dubchuk a.k.a. the Ringo Kid versus three escaped prisoners led by Hamilton Leider, a deranged patriot who demands respect and controls through violence.Trevanian captures the spirit of the Old West through this basic struggle between good and evil. The story is funny, sad and certainly thought-provoking. It is the type of story that will be long remembered and probably re-read merely for the pure enjoyment and pleasure of it."
1,Not The Best.,"I don't think this is a very good cartoon classic. It is somewhat boring, and the cartoons aren't very good (with the acception of ""The tortise and the hare""). If you're thinking about buying this, maybe you should think again."
1,Skip it,"I purchased this for Christmas and returned it after 3 days. I was very disappointed that it did not toast evenly. Warning - you don't get any Mickey Mouse image on wheat or rye bread. To get any image, one side is completely burnt. Do yourself a favor - skip this product."
2,Good Looking and Fun but not a good toaster,"My husband bought this toaster for us for Christmas this year. We are huge Disney fans. The looks of this toaster are great and when the toast is done it plays the ""mickey mouse march"", but the toast had to be toasted twice if you didn't want it to burn and one side is not toasted evenly. The Mickey face on the toast is a fun novelty but I'd rather have my toast and waffles really toasted. It also does not accomodate the wide bread - like Orowheat Country varieties. I was quite disappointed."
4,I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about,"I got this toaster as a birthday present and I love it. I use it everyday. I am, of course, a Disney freak and love just about everything Disney. ... But don't be afraid! I've found this toaster to be WONDERFUL. I think the little Mickey Mouse March tune when the toast pops up is ADORABLE (but you can turn it off if you would like) The image of Mickey on the bread is also awesome. It is true that the image appears better on some bread than on others. Experiment! The sides of the toaster stay really cool during toasting (unlike some other ""cool touch"" toasters I have seen)... Get it and try it yourselves! You may find yourself humming M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E in the mornings :)"
1,I am a long time,Horror watcher and collector: I will make this fast as these movies were some of the worst I have ever seen. Deserve none of my time. Speech out of sync. Quality not good at all. This deserves zero but can not give it. Do not waste money as I did. Also Acting pathetic as well as story lines.
2,Very poorly recorded,"Yes, it is missing the George C. Scott dialogue, but I figured at least I could have the excellent film score. Unfortunately, the orchestra was very badly recorded. The volume is the worst problem. Quieter parts of the score are impossible to hear without turning the volume way up, and then when it gets louder you have to turn it down again. I'll be looking for my old vinyl album in my attic now, which is probably warped."
1,Please add the dialog!,"Although this is a music soundtrack, the original audio tape version had the speeches on it (which I loved). Well that tape is quite old and I would like to have those speeches and music on CD now. The music is awesome. But the speech in the beginning of the original soundtrack set the mood for the music. The end speech was a great way to end the music (as it did the film). They had it right the first time. Too bad they had to change a good thing. I hope the powers that be release a new version with the speeches. Till then, I'll hold off on buying it."
4,"Very, very good and inspirational.","I enjoy the music from ""Patton"" as much as I enjoy the movie. A very good buy."
2,There ARE alternatives,"This recording suffers from bad mixing. There are 2 cds out on the market,with COMPLETE scores, much better than this one. For my money, if you are a real Goldsmith fan,they are well worth the price. They have a website that is noted for filmscores.They also publish a print magazine as well. If you liked this, and want to hear the REAL soundtracks,you will have to do your homework!"
1,Won't Be Buying,"I have been looking for the original score on CD for several years, particularly for the GC Scott speeches. I thought I had finally found it, but was disappointed to read the reviews which said that they had been excised. I thank the reviewers that mentioned this omission. I will not be buying this album. However, from the number of disappointed purchasers, I suspect the original soundtrack would have a modest following. Not unlike a rerelease of Evergreen by the Stone Ponys and Linda Ronstadt."
5,Patton: A Great American Classic,"There are a LOT of recordings out on the market that contain some or all of Jerry Goldsmith's Patton score.The sound quality and content of this recording is very good. Tora! Tora! Tora! is an un-necessary but nice bonus.I love the George C. Scott speech, but I am fine with getting that in the movie. This CD got me the haunting, hair-tingling melody that the movie burned onto my brain many years ago-it is all I need...I would just buy the movie for the complete score and speech if I want it later.Overall, I am happy with the quality and value of this recording and would recommend it for moderate fans. For the Die-Hard fans, check out ""Patton [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack] [SOUNDTRACK]"" which is also for sale on Amazon.com. It looks like it is more of a collector's type item."
2,Not for fans of the original score,"Don't buy this if you want a CD version of the original vinyl soundtrack. This is a new and somewhat different rendition of the score and it's missing George C. Scott's classic opening address to the troops and his closing statement. Also, in my opinion, some of the music isn't as good as the original."
2,Better versions exist elsewhere,"Altho the attempt was grand,the result was a poorly miked version of both soundtracks. There ARE 2 COMPLETE versions of both soundtracks out on the market. You will have to look for them, they are at a well known film score website that also has a print magazine. Nice attempt,well done,but lacking in sound quality and impact. Find the original scores, and then decide!"
3,Not up to the original's standard,"This isn't the original soundtrack; if I had to give it a label, I'd call it ""variations on a theme of Patton."" Not that the disk is bad per se. It's just that, well, I grew up with the original soundtrack, and that's the version that I know and love -- especally the ""All glory is fleeting"" monologue. Which is missing from this release -- as is the opening monologue."
4,One of Goldsmith's best scores,"However, Why Jerry did not attempt to arrange this music to sound as close to the original soundtrack as possible, is a mystery to me. The Scottish Nt'l Orchestra is great, but has a distinctly different sound. Part of the difficulty may be in the types of synthesizing Jerry used in the original recording, it's hard to say. Regardless, Patton is his best score, I believe."
5,best compilation of top recorders ever,"I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE THIS CD AS INCREDIBLE.WHILE THE MUSIC IS GOOD, THE RECORDINGS ARE SO GOOD, THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DECIDE WHICH ONE SHOULD BE THE STANDARD TO MEASSURE AGAINST THE OTHERS.WHAT YOU CAN BE SURE IS THAT ON MY OPINION THEY ARE AS CLOSE TO PERFECT AS A REAL SESSION CAN BE.IT WILL FOR SURE OUTPERFORM YOUR CURRENT REFERENCE RECORDING.THE LAST TRACK, SUMMERTIME, IS RECORDED ON THE SAME QUALITY AS THE OTHERS, BUT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PLAYERS ON THIS TRIO VERSION DESERVE TO BE INCLUDED ON THE COMPILATION .IT IS TRULLY A PERFECT AUDIOPHILE DREAM.YOU BLEW AWAY THE COMPETITION SHEFFIELD. GOOD JOB."
2,This movie is stupid,"This movie is stupid and several of the main characters are completely obnoxious, particularly the director. If you find stupid movies entertaining you may like this. It also gives a false impression that Elizabeth Hurley is a significant part of the movie; she is on the screen for all of about 2 minutes once."
5,perfect,"shipped super quick from over seas, was what it should have been works perfect price couldnt have been better. great buy"
2,Not what you think it is,I bought this for my mac and no where on the details did it say that it was or was not mac compatible. Doesnt work and I am very sorry I bought it.
5,Highly Recommended,"Don't hesitate to buy this cable if you need a quick and affordable solution to your technical needs. The cable is much more light weight than previous equivalents I have owned, making is easy to pack away when not in use. The connections appear durable and it functions completely as a USB cable should."
4,The More the Merrier,"My 5 year old daughter absolutely loved this book about a farmer on his way to the fair who picks up animals along the way also headed to the fair. She was amused to see the cow sitting in the truck, chuckled at the sheep, but roared at the reaction of the farmer when the pigs joined the merry group. This story truly is a road to fun."
4,Daughter approved,"My daughter loves all these books. I dont see why but she loves them, they're easy and repetitious. I thought they were too easy but she can sit there and read them over and over again. As long as she's happy :)"
3,Spy Kids,"Spykids is a movie made new film makers. A little long at time. Great plot. Fun for boys as an action film. It is definitely elementary aged. Enjoyed that they didn't have a budget for special effects and improvised. We were having a good time with it because it is silly at times and liked overcoming fears as a theme. Not what expected because our house has teenagers, this is a children's film."
3,Okay plot but low-budget shows,"I read some very positive reviews of this film and so purchased it for my family. I'm not sure where those great reviews came from (from a site other than Amazon I think, not sure now) but this film was pretty low-budget and cheesy.I do give them props for making the film, and the part of the story about the mother trying to help her daughter overcome fear I thought was excellent, but due to the production quality this movie is in our list of possibly the worst 2 movies we've every seen.So if you want to watch some high school-aged spies stop a man from blowing up the town, and with Christian themes, it's okay, but definitely not a Hollywood quality production. If, however, you need a film to help talk about how to handle fear from a Biblical perspective (for your teens) this might be a good conversation starter."
2,Christian spies?,"This movie is a strange B movie with pretty badly done special effectsand a very preachy Christian script.Since one wonders what Jesus might think of his teaching being usedto give a young female spy courage, I have to give this bad marks.The acting in most cases is just a little short of Hollywood,but mostly like an local playhouse stage production.I think they should get some credit for at least tryingto get Christian ideals and concepts before a modern audience,but a lot less for ideologically shrewing up badly?"
5,Damme Christie's best work ever!!! You won't put it down!!!,"I must have spent every afternoon last summer,waiting for this book to come in by mail! When I finally got it,I never let it out of my sight!Since then it has become my favorite novel! I always recommend it! My next quest was to find all the movie versions based on the novel. It was made into a movie 4 times,and I have all the versions,it took me 9 months to get them. It was made into a movie in 1945,1965,1975,and 1989! I paid 90 dollars for the last one(thank you videoflicks)!The one that took me the longest to get was the 1975 one,because it was out of print,and not very many copies are left in the world!But the book is so suspenseful!I never would have guessed the murderer's identity!To tell the truth,I didn't know who to suspect!The only real one that I would have guessed is ..... like i'm goint to tell you! the only thing bad about the book,was that I didn't want it to end,and neither will you! Happy Reading!!"
1,Needs better description,"I bought this as a book for my daughter's novels class. Unfortunately it's a play. It needs a more thorough descrition up front to avoid this happening to others. I hate to rate this as a 1, it's Amazon's description that needs updating."
1,This is not the book; it's a play adaptation.,"This is not the book ""And Then There Were None"" by Agatha Christie; it is an play adaptation of the book. If you want that actual Agatha Christie book, do not purchase this item."
1,"This is a play, not the novel","The description does not say this is the play. I needed the novel for my child's class, and thought that was what I ordered. Only after we got it did we realize it is not what we wanted.Amazon - please update the description which is misleading."
5,Metal survives at Amazon,"If you grew up in the eighties and miss the guitar rock of the era.. If your a fan of Gamma Ray or Blind Guardian, or just a true metal head, you'll love this CD, this band is very intense musically and Lyrically, no bad language, just intense writing. I'd recommend this to any metal head out there,"
3,disappointing,"I can't quite put my finger on why I was so disappointed in this book. The characters were well-drawn, and fairly sympathetic, each in their own way. The plot moved along relatively briskly. I just don't know. Maybe it was Godwin's habit of ""foreshadowing"" an event in the past. Several times we hear about a life-changing event in a characters life before we are taken back to find out what happened. Just tell us already and stop playing games! Perhaps it was that certain parts of it seemed contrived, not plot-wise, just writing-wise, as though Godwin said to herself ""Ah, there's a clever thought, I must find a way to write it into my next book."" And then she did, in the guise of writing about writers and thinkers. It became very annoying to have these things we were obviously supposed to regard as ""gems"" littering an otherwise good scene."
1,"Someday, I too will understand - I hope!","when I first heard this song - I must say I had no idea what Britney was on about. I could hardly understand her. Then I saw the video clip and the only thing that gave away the rationale for the song was her belly and the line - 'No moment will be more true, Then the moment I look at you'. At that point I thought it was a song that she was dedicating to her baby - everything else, I still don't understand!As for her vocals...well, that's another story all together."
1,BFFFF a real britney?? someday??? jjajaajaj NEVER,"This song its just a slowpop demostration, very bad voice .. .... iTs A BAD ARTIST"
5,"Short CD, but still amazing!!!!!","This album has only a few songs, but they're all so, so great! Britney returned after In The Zone with this excellent, but short production, but it doesn't mean that it's bad!"
2,Desperate For Love--Desperate For Some Excitement,"This video is based loosely on a true story of young love and obsession gone horribly wrong and ending in murder. The subject matter involves a young lady (Tammy Lauren) ""desperately"" trying to win the affections of a young man who is only mildly interested in her, and the consequences of her using his best friend (Christian Slater) to attract his attention. Christian Slater's character has been in love with the young lady for sometime, and the misplaced affection he receives brings the situation to a horrible end. This film had a lot of conversational drama and very little action. Fans of Tammy Lauren and Christian Slater are probably going to want to own this film out of a since of completism, because both young people have considerable camera time. As a huge fan of Tammy Lauren myself, it pains me to see her talents wasted in this movie, but her ability to come off as real and true to the character she plays still stands out in the performance."
4,It works,"Cooks taters faster than just putting them on the grate; only downside is that the taters stick to the prongs that hold them. Even after seasoning the rack, spraying with PAM, etc, taters still stick, but otherwise it is what it is."
4,Great... except for the cover,"This book contains two novels originally published (in two parts each) in the ""Man-Kzin Wars"" series, which by now has run into 9 books. I consider these two among the best of the series' offerings, describing psychology and family life of kzinti in great detail. The reason I am giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is the cover. It is obvious that the artist never read the book - the two aliens are not kzinti, they are oversized humans in tiger masks! Kzinti anatomy and proportions are quite different from those of humans, and sufficiently described in the book."
3,This is a repackaging of works available elsewhere,"The works in this volume are well chosen, but you'll already have them if you've been working the numbered volumes."
2,Fluke support not what I expected.,Since I knew some of the 87-5's suffered from GSM interference issues I called Fluke when I received my unit to make sure it was unaffected. The Fluke representative was flippant and borderline rude. When I asked if it he knew what the affected serial numbers were he flatly said no. After an additional push he said he could look it up. He looked it up and upon finding it was a rather stale serial number he told me I should just return it and try my luck again. I told him that I didn't want to spend weeks playing multimeter roulette and he just shoved my call off to another department. After being on the phone for quite a while no one at fluke seemed to be ready to offer a solution so I returned it to amazon. This is supposed to be a premium product and it definitely carries a premium price I expected better support for an item with a known issue.
1,Beware!!! Fluke is an awful company with zero customer service,Beware buying Fluke products. If you have a part malfunction they will ignore you. They have zero customer service basically just automated email responses that tell you that they have no interest in helping you.
3,Its a good instrument to be used.,"This instrument is one that i have used and really is the tool that all the Engineers ought to have,and use."
5,All the necessary and the pluses,"The Fluke 87-5 is reasonably considered the finest choice for at least the first and second of the four multimeters (four--to measure, e.g., input and output powers at the same time by simultaneous measurements on input and output voltages and currents) that anyone who is serious about electronics should have. The 87-5 is portable, accurate, responsive, reliable, durable, and feature rich. The earlier 5-star reviews are not overstated! Online video reviews are available at [...]."
5,look here first,"and don't spend your money on the more expensive product. this center channel is awesome. it was the first i bought, and kept. the reviews are spot=on."
5,"I loved charms,spells,and formulas","Well,this takes care of my spell needs.I am already making a voodoo doll and it is coming out perfect.I've done some of the spells and they have worked!"
5,Just DO it!,"I love this book! Colorful, entertaining, powerful, informative... these are all words that describe Charms, Spells and Forumulas by Houngan Rev. Ray Marlbrough. It's been out for a while, but if you don't have a copy yet, get with the program, buy a copy, choose an exercise or spell in the book, and just DO it! -- Mambo Racine"
4,Voodoo,"The Rev. Malbrough knows how to explain voodoo (or vou dou) so the novice or non-practitioner can understand and find it useful. There's nothing magical or witchy about reading a psalm or two to help you feel better about stuff going on in your life unless you have a wall up against not being a ""pure Wiccan "". If that's you, don't waste your time. If you have an open mind, pick up this book and see if something inside speaks to you!"
5,Wonder kit,"I had a copy of this book before but got lost while relocating. Great book for those who are devoted to the saints. All the prayers here are excellent and above all they work. I feel indebted to the author. If you love to pray to the saints, this is a must have."
5,"Charms, Spells and Formulas",Very informative book. Simple and to the point. The organization of this book is great and makes it easy to use. A very good book for beginners in magic. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to start your studies in magic.
5,Good book,"This little book is great. I think all who are into charms, spellsand formula should have a copy of this book."
1,TIMES THREE!,"THIS BOOKGOES AGINST THE WICCAN RELIGION AND LAWS. "" AN IT HARM NONE DO WHAT THOU WILT."" IF YOU DO SOMETHING BAD IT WILL COME BACK TO YOU TIMES THREE SO IF YOU MAKE A VOODOO DOLLOF SOMEONE THREE PEOPLE WILL MAKE ONE OF YOU!"
3,Great way to begin,"I found this book to be helpful with regards to incorporating catholisism and magic. True some of the herbs and ingredience needed are difficult to find but for the ""True"" practitioner nothing is impossible. I recomend this to all those willing to get their feet wet in using magic. The book is easy to understand and follow. I especially loved the prayers to the saints towards the end."
4,Cool,"This book is really interesting. I just got it the other day at Hot Topic in the mall and can't put it down. I'm a beginner, and I haven't heard of some of the ingredients the spells require. All in all, the book is a good one for beginners."
2,"charms, spells and formulas","a great little book for reference, for the beginner wiccans with a little experiance in the craft."
3,"Good information, but...","... most of the ingredients are honestly hard - if not impossible - to obtain, and that's coming from a girl who lives in a very big city. Other than that, not a bad book, but I'd recommend reading it while at your local bookstore before purchasing this."
2,"Interesting, but not all there","The book contains many ceremonies, which are nice, but does not include theories for much of what is written. If you would just like a book to flip from ceremony to ceremony, this is for you, but for a more comprehensive take on the craft you should probably find something else. The ingredients for the spells are hard to find, and possibly nonexistant, which also makes the book hard to get enthusiastic about. All in all, I was looking for something the book did not have, historic relevance."
2,Weird,"I just found this book WEIRD. I think it's definitely not for the beginner, since there's hardly any background information revealed. Also, the ingredients ARE hard to find and the reader doesn't really find out the reason for performing the spells THE WAY they are explained.Might be good side-reading for those on the quest of learning about the different types of magic(k)al work or following the rules of HooDoo, but I don't think it's suitable for anyone else."
2,"If you are wiccan, beware that Malbrough is not","This book does what it claims to by providing recipes and guides for charms, spells, and formulas. However, most of the recipes included within are in direct opposition to basic `an it harm none' rule of Wicca. I'm not saying that this is intended to be a book geared towards Wiccans-in fact, Malbrough's other book is about invoking the saints, so I would venture to guess that he is not Wiccan at all. But if YOU are Wiccan, as I am, you will probably find little in this book...spells to make people fall in love with you? Spells to hex others? Wiccans understand that magic is not about controlling others, and controlling others is precisely what many of Malbrough's charms, spells, and formulas aim to do."
2,useless,"Yo,Hate to be negative, but the information in this book is nearly all useless. It tends to be set in a medeivil time period, and all of its revipes, etc. are made to be used in such a time."
3,some what ok..,it was very resourcfull...good book to get a general idea of whats going on with spells and magic...
2,"disappointing, frustrating, poor review of topics","This was a good beginners book, so I have no complaints about the first few chapters. But as you progress to the second and last third of the book, the exercises become progressively and unfairly difficult, and not because they are meant to challenge us. Instead, they are just poorly written.Problems in textbooks should illuminate, not obfuscate key topics in the chapter. When a major problem asks you to calculate out a complex situation, there should be more explicit and explanatory examples in the chapter text in order for a good student to go back and teach himself the principles that the authors are trying to test, instead of struggling to figure out what they are asking to begin with. Other managerial accounting books are much better at illuminating even the basic ideas that students like us need to learn, not to mention to complex accounting practices on exams."
5,Great Service!,Great service and book was brand new as described. I liked fact that book was well wrapped even inside mailing envelope. Very pleased!
3,Makes me relax.,"This soundtrack really made me relax when ever I had a bad day. I'd recomend it for whoever wants an OK cd. I've heard much better, but I've hear much worse."
2,NOT one of the best Martin Beck books,"After reading all ten of the Martin Beck series, I'll contest the other reviews: This is one of the two lame-ducks of the lot. (""Murder at the Savoy"" is the other.) The socialist commentary is ladled on like chocolate syrup at an unsupervised birthday party for four-year-olds. The action is limited to one day (unlike the careful development of time in other Beck books) and places an emphasis on the stupidity and brutatlity of Swedish police, and it's far over-the-top when compared to other works in the series, such as ""Cop Killer"" and ""The Laughing Policeman.""Whatever you do, DON'T start with this one. ""Roseanna"" and ""The Laughing Policeman"" are better bets to ease into the Beck series.Ironically, the book ended up as an excellent Swedish movie -- ""The Man on the Roof"" -- that's subtitled in English and available used in VHS. The movie stripped out the socialism and other extraneous commentary to focus on action and plot development."
2,A poor mystery in a great country...Sweden,Any novel needs a good deal more than plot. Ugh. Where is the human story? Just a waste of time.
4,Read it some years ago: Has come to back to mind many times.,"In light of the way this book keeps returning to my mind,I'd like to give it a fairly high rating. It is a work ofmurder-mystery fiction, written by two Scandanavian journalists.I don't want to give too much away. There is a ""Darryl Gates""type of figure: i.e. a Police Chief who for years presidesover a brutal police force. That is why I keep recallingthis book. One might argue Gates's merits, but this workpresents the worst-case-scenario."
2,A Big Letdown!,"I've read the first 6 books and found them very entertaining. There was a little social commentary (not overt though) and the plots were good with dollops of humour. I found The Abominable Man very disappointing by comparison. If you think a story revolving around police brutality with virtually no plot and little humour will appeal to you, go for it; otherwise give the book a miss. I give it 2 stars at a push."
3,Not what I expected.,I like the wires connection design. Fan is quiet. The problem I had was the fan guard or cover came loose and stop the fan from spinning when I transported it in my car. It should been able to handle the vibration but it did not.. This is the first time this ever happen. Quality of the build is the issue.. I just removed the broken fan guard and the power supply pretty much worked fine. Since I did that warranty is probably voided. Can not avoid down time. Would gave a five star if not for the problem.
3,Not Nearly as Good as the Other Dummies Wine Books,"I have read French and Italian Wine for Dummies over and over again and always find something new and useful. Australian and New Zealand Wine for Dummies, on the other hand, is a tough slog even one time through. The bland writing style is bad enough but what is really annoying is that the author refrains from making recommendations. No ""look for these producers"", no ""following is my list of recommended Clare Valley wines"" - just general descriptions."
2,"Plain, Simple, Boring","This book is filled with information. Information that is mainly useless. I usually read 60 pages a day reading about wine, but I always dreaded having to read 10 pages a day from this book. Everything is repeated over and over again. There is no pronunciation guide, so if you see an unusual word that you do not know how to say, you'll feel like your losing ground by not saying it right. The the main maps of Australia and New Zealand are somewhat decent, but the maps that they give for each region, for each chapter or section, are so detailed that there is no way you can reference where about they are in that specific region. Meaning they zoomed into roads, not cities (unlike French and Italian Wines for Dummies). To cut to the chase, the only positive thing I could come up with about this book, is that it is a rather large book and it would look good in your wine book shelf to impress friends. :)"
5,Worth the wait,This particular knife was hard to find and my friend was delighted to receive it as a gift.
3,Panofsky E&M 2nd Edition,"Book is more about ""words"" than it is about math. YOu need to have a book like Jackson, or Griffiths to complement this book. To be honest, I hate it and don't use it. I like Jackson better. Makes assumptions with no proof."
1,Shocking in a very bad way,"What can I say? I am a huge fan of all Japanese movies (anime and live actions). The monsters in this movie were creepy (disgusting creepy). My kids didn't like it from the beginning and left the room. I finished it with fast - forward mode.It is a good story, but because of the extreme make up and the hideousness of the monsters, it became too much to watch. Sorry, I was fooled by the title and the reviews."
3,3.8 starts good movie....excellent effects...,The english sub-titles are easy to read and do not stop one from enjoyingthis fantasy movie. Its like the Neverending Story but with better effectsand characters. Good for multiple viewings.
5,"Blunt, powerful, and honest","John MacArthur takes the worldly modern church to task for wussing out on the gospel. By pointing back to Spurgeon's battle with the religious pander boys of the late 19th century, the author notes that nothing really has changed much. Many thanks for such a courageous book."
4,What is Wrong With our Churches?,"MacArthur presents the case of the User-Friendly Church that wants to be everything to everyone. He shows the spiritual and biblical weakness of this position, then takes the reader on a romp through the Bible showing the true Biblical mission of Christ's Church showing that Calvanism and Evangelism are compatable. The information in the appendices provides very useful historical information. The mixed use of various versions of the bible to illustrate points can be confusing."
5,"blues you can see, not just feel","Hopkins is usually referred to as the epitome of Texas blues, and without having listened to any of his contemporaries in this regard, I can still see why he is labeled as such. This album has tracks with dark, bold sounds and a delivery unlike Delta bluesmen that put you out on the desolate back country or in the hard work place. Coupled with the words, your mind is focused on the most basic and essential traits of life for a black man in the hard living conditions of Texas, and the raw emotion evoked by these circumstances. In an interesting contrast, some of his songs have a very lighthearted feel to them, but the lyrics mention nothing reminiscent of high life, thereby emphasizing the emptiness of Hopkins' ""thesis of blues"", for lack of a better phrase."
5,Just Ahead,I've known Pat Coil since 1980 when he gave me an alley kitten with a broken leg in Dallas. He was amazing then as well as now. His outstanding talent as a writer and player is only surpassed by his style and class. Definitely Top of the Line!
2,no Medieval hero....,"I agree with the 2 other reviewers-despite a beautiful cover-this book was ugly.The male lead was no hero towards the heroine. He was very alpha male- to the point where he keeps espousing how any woman is basically there as a brood mare for heir begetting and to pleasure him in bed. He even brings his new bride home and still has his mistress installed in the home as his Chtelaine! Why does so many Medieval Romance writers have to make the hero a big, rude, boorish brute?Like another reviewer I was also surprised at the amount of sex in this Harlequin Historical. In this case it seriously hinders the storyline.Save your money and skip this book.1.5 stars for a pretty cover."
2,"Not as good as I expected, or hoped","I kept wishing this novel was better, because it has such a promising plot and began well. After a while into the story it seemed very repetitious, and by the end, I was forcing myself to finish it. Not at all what I expected from Ms. Archer after reading ""Dragon's Dower"". But that's a later book, so I guess her skills improved with age."
3,THREE OBSCURE DISCO CLASICS,"This album from the heyday of disco includes at least three underground club classics: Le's All Chant by the Michael Zager Band, a weird chant that was a disco Number One in 1978 and also made it big on the pop charts, Whitney's mom Cissy Houston's magnificent Think It Over, a real club stormer, and Andrea True's eurodisco hit What's Your Name What's Your Number, a song that really reflected the nature of those decadent disco days. Let's All Chant has been revived by many different artists down the years but none of these cover versions has the weird otherworldly sound of the original. Get this album for these dance classics, they're far better than most of today's Techno and House music."
3,Ya! Hiterjugend,"The most defining moment for the 12th SS was the murder of 12 Canadain POW at the Abby Ardennes during the Normandy landings. This event is glossed over, the commanding general, Kurt Meyer was Canada's only war criminal. He served 5 years in Dorchester Prison in NB. This book is a very weak translation from German - very slow at times. However, a must for those interested in the Waffen SS. Comes with a seperate map book, so you can follow the battles - very neat!"
5,A Great Magazine For The Yacht Lover,"This magazine is the best on the subject when it comes to super yachts. Every other month you get a magazine that is at least 250 pages of full color. Great reviews with pictures, and etc make you feel like you're on the boat. Also has lots of news regarding yachts that are currently in construction and also articles about the yachting life. I highly recommend this magazine!"
1,Not an origianl soundtrack,"This is of course, not an origianl soundtrack recording as one would be led to believe by the advertisement on Amazon. It doesn't even have the quality recording a soundtrack album has. why there isn't a true soundtrack album available of this score is puzzling in the least. The least Amazon could do is take their original sountrack label off of this recording."
3,Not the original,"The original overture was my favorite piece of this sound tract. It is missing here, in favor of a rehash of the love theme, which was good, but does NOT replace the original overture. Disappointing..."
4,Fun Han Solo adventure,"While not as engrossing as Crispin's Han Solo trilogy, Brian Daley's Han Solo adventures are still alot of fun.As far as the story goes, Han and some partners of his he picks up on the way are in search of a treasure beyond anything they could imagine. Anyone who's read the previous two Daley books knows that Han's luck in such endeavors isn't always the best, so of course hijinks ensue!Familiar faces are back, namely Bollux and Blue Max who are two of my favorite characters in all of the Star Wars extended universe and I'll miss reading about them.All in all, a fun and fast paced Han Solo and Chewie adventure with lots of action. It reads pretty quickly because it's rather short but definetly for anyone who's a fan of Han Solo."
3,The Falcon is hijacked in the corporate sector,"This is the third story of the Brian daley trilogy. Brian also did the radio dramas but sadly died before seeing the expanded universe explode into what it has become. He is the first EU novelists.My favorite of the Daley trilogy is Han solo's Revenge. Second is HS at Stars End (which is also available is a Dark horse comic). Lost legacy is my least favorite of the three stories, but it is still a good read.One vacation I read in order the first 2 AC Crispen novels of the Han solo trilogy. Then I read the daley trilogy and concluded with the last of the Crispen trilogy, Rebel Dawn. AC Crispen did a good job writing his trilogy as he accommodated the Daley books."
3,"""Seems"" = A+","""Seems"" is great/best. Rest of the album is a little unfocused, like the band can't decide if it wants to be post-grunge or psychedelic. Kind of like a rougher, confused Blind Melon. I recommend it."
4,PortaMate PM7002 Machine Mounts,"You cannot really write a review for this product without talking about the PortaMate PM7000HTC PM7000 Portamate Miter Saw & Power Tool Work Center, a product I am very happy with. The extra machine mounts allow me to have additional bench mounted tools at the ready for mounting on my PortaMate."
1,Offset mounting kit is unavailable,"HTC seems to have gone out of business. The phone number listed in the product manual and on their web site are no longer in service. If your tool as offset holes (not in straight line) the you need kit J-104 that allegedly can be ordered from HTC. However, the number has been disconnected. This is unfortunate because I really wanted the PM7000 but this little snafu severely decreases the products versatility. I wonder how long these mounts will be available?"
3,My picky dog does not like it,But my sons dogs do so I am giving it to him. I tried 2 flavors but my dachshund just doesn't like it. She is however totally spoiled so I don't really blame the product.
1,Absolutely not squirrel proof,"Location is irrelevant. Squirrels either jump onto the roof or climb up the pole. Once on the feeder, they either hang upside down from the edge of the roof and dip in or they hang on to the side and reach around. Once they figured it out, seed consumption has gone from 40 pounds a month to 25 pounds a week. Squirrels are greedy and they loiter, making it harder for the birds to get any. If you're looking for a squirrel feeder (not squirrel-proof), then this product is fine. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,Definitely NOT squirrel proof!,I thought I would finally get a handle on the squirrels eating out the bird's food so I bought this. What a crock! These squirrels are so smart they shortly learned how to circumvent the feeder lock by locking their feet on the pole and reaching over the locking bar.Now how squirrel proof is that? Big big waste of money! Don't even go there.
1,Does not Work for Starlings,We bought this to keep squirrels and starlings away - the starlings are so smart they can figure out how to feed on it.
5,the birds love it,the birds love it and so do i - so far the squirrels have not been able to steal the food - they are sticking to their own. thanks
2,Squirrel Proof? NO way!,"Like some of the other posters stated, this feeder is not squirrel proof in the least. The squirrels hang from the roof , down the side so their weight is not on the rail that closes the food off. We fill the feeder and within an hour or so, they have cleaned it out. They keep the top (roof) nasty from sitting on top of it too."
3,Can't be Chewed,"Basically, I have liked this feeder.The squirrels can't chew into it, but the smarter ones--seems like there are several--have been able to hang by their toes and steal seed. Not a lot, but when they are there, the birds aren't. The squirrels have tried their best to chew even through the drainage holes--not possible.The deer--perhaps a little smarter than the average squirrel?--have figured out how to tip the thing so that seed falls out onto the ground. Hanging it higher solved that problem.It's rugged, and I've had it for years, but 2 of my little windows are broken (leaving access) so I need to repair them. And the paint is scratched and damaged by the squirrels. A little Rustoleum will fix that. . . ."
3,Not bird selective,I already had a great squirrel proof baffel on my feeder.I bought the Absolute II because it said the perches were adjustable for different weight birds. My goal was to keep the flocks of grackels from cleaning out my feeder in one day. If the heavier birds land ON THE PERCH it works. Problem is they can land sideways on the feeding platform avoiding the perch altoghether and eat to their hearts content! Very dissapointed :(
3,Birds don't like it much,"I replaced my Squirrel B Gone (which got horrible reviews but which the birds loved) with this feeder. The squirrels haven't bothered it, but the birds don't seem to like it either. The construction is excellent. I will probably use the included pole-mount and move it to the back of the house since it's not very attractive. It will probably hold up for much longer than my old feeder, though."
1,The NOT-squirrel proof feeder,"This feeder is definitely NOT squirrel proof. Within 10 minutes of hanging it outside, a squirrel had figured out that if he hung on by one back foot to the tiny ledge or crevice created by the window showing how much feed is inside, he could take enough weight off the rod to allow himself unlimited access to the seed. Then he went and told all his friends about how to get the seed! The manufacturer needs to eliminate the windows across the top showing the feed level and make a totally smooth front. This MAY make it squirrel-proof, but I'm not promising that!"
4,Good bird feeder.,"It's well made and the squirrels don't bother with it. The only problem is that my birds don't like it as much as my other feeders (Squirrel Buster). I bought it to try and attract cardinals and they aren't too interested. The other birds go to this one when there's no space at their favorite feeders. If it's the only feeder you're going to have, it will probably do a great job for you."
4,Large capacity,This feeder has a very large capacity. The squirrels are very ingenious however but this feeder requires more work to get a little seed. The squirrels lose interest after awhile.
4,Yes birds - No squirrels,Have not had this product long enough to be sure the squirrels can't get into it but it is very well constructed and good looking too. Only time will tell about our little long tailed critters and their uncanny ability to get into just about any kind of bird feeder.
3,Needs improvement,"The perching area is a little crowded for birds the size of cardinals, but fine for smaller birds. The cardinals have to constantly flutter and jump around to the sides to get to the seeds. I jury rigged a slightly extended perching bar on one side for the cardinals. The pole is fine."
5,Great Birdfeeder,I mounted the Heritage feeder on a sheppards hook but I still had to install a baffel to keep the squirrels off. They couldn't get to the food but I didn't want them to break the feeder in some way. All birds love this feeder. I have seen 7 or 8 small birds at one time & others waiting their turn. It took the Cardinals a while but they now love this feeder. Well built & would highly recommend the Absolute II for all kinds of birds. I fill with regular sunflower seeds.
3,"Not squirrel proof at all, but I like squirrels!","My wife has tried all kinds of different feeders to defeat the squirrels, but none have worked. She had high-hopes for this one, but it didn't take the squirrels long to figure out how to hang from the sides while working the lever up and down to release seeds. On the other hand, I LIKE squirrels, even had a tame one when I was a kid. So I keep rooting for the squirrels. They gotta eat too! And for those who think of squirrels as cute rats, they are not. Rats live about 3 to 4 years. Squirrels can live for 20 years. That means there are squirrels in the woods around our house who have been here longer than we have. And I figure they have a right to survive! Rats, on the other hand, I have an air rifle with a scope to take care of them...."
2,squirrel picnic,"Don't know if feeder is squirrel proof or not as the squirrels don't bother. The feeder spills so much seed on ground, they dine leisurely with no effort."
4,Does a fairly good job,"This feeder replaced a platform feeder on a pole 10' away from our house. The squirrels would jump from our roof onto the platform feeder and feast to their little hearts' content. We hoped they would slide off this feeder when they landed, but that didn't happen. We also hoped the closing perches would deny them access to the bird food, but they learned to stand on the arched bird feeder hangers below and not rest their weight on the perches. Still, they have to work much harder and get much less for their efforts than with previous bird feeders, so in that respect it's a success.I would have given this 5 stars, except that our birds don't seem as attracted to this feeder as to others. It seems to be the feeder of last resort for most of them, whereas the wooden platform feeder it replaced was their first choice. The feeder has been up for about 2 months, and we are hoping this will change over time."
2,Not what I hoped for,"We placed this in service in a Michigan winter. We enjoyed watching the squirrels trying to figure it out. For the most part it kept them out of the seed except when there was a coating of ice on the top from which they could hang. The downside is it tends to keep the larger birds away, such as Blue Jays, Red-bellied and to some extent Cardinals. It would probably deter Rose- Breasteds, Cowbirds, Red-winged Blackbirds etc. in the summer. It's nice for a secondary feeder perhaps but not very attrative nor does it hold as much feed as our old cedar platform feeder. Nice try but no cigar."
2,cheap construction,"I was surprised with the cheap materials and condition on the feeder when we opened it. I had to bend the edges of the cover to get it to engage, as the thinness of the metal had allowed the feeder to get damaged in shipment. I have purchased feeders such as this in the past and they were more sturdy. I could go on and on, but I recommend that consumers look elsewhere and pay a few more dollars on better quality."
4,post,mounting post very poor. also the part that goes into ground is not long enough to keep from feeder from wobbling
2,not as smart as the average New England black and grey squirrel,This feeder had great promise for the first day or so.....until the squirrel figured out how to hang from the roof and not touch the bar...maybe some other areas of the country don't have the smart ones that we have here in New England..but I swear they are now laughing at me...outsmarted the average human-being...I must say in defense of this feeder..they don't stay on it too long..so less seed is consumed....but they still keep the birds away while they're gourging themselves...
4,Great Feeder,"This is the best bird feeder I've ever seen. Solid construction, design, easy fill, proper sized feeder holes (my last one trapped and occasionally killed birds when the seed was low). Would give 5 stars if less than $40. It's way over priced but if you love feeding birds then why not go for it."
1,Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder,"The Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder is a flop. What happens is while the squirrel can't directly get bird seed, when he crawls around the top of the feeder, the shaking motion allows the seeds to go flying. I've adjusted the tension on the gates, which doesn't matter.The bird feeder sits atop a metal pole I've tried greasing that metal pole 10-30 W motor oil, it irritates the squirrel somewhat, with no lasting effect. What really screws up the squirrel is when I use transmission fluid or power steering fluid."
1,"No birds, NO star.","Because the squirrels kept our feeders empty theses looked like the ideal solution so I bought two.We definitely saved on birdfood because the birds won't come near them. I've gone back to ourold feeders. For me, these feeders were a huge waste of money. I cannot recommend them."
3,"Great feeder, bad squirrel-proofing",Heritage Farms Squirrel Proof Wild Bird Feeders use counterweight system to keep squirrels out (according to their site). Please read my review for Heritage Farms 7533 Absolute Squirrel Proof Wild Bird Feeder I own before you buy this one. It might help your family avoid traumatic experience we had today. NOTE: I do NOT work for anybody and I describe my own experience.
1,WRONG DESCRIPTION & IMAGE,"The item name and picture are for a squirrel-*proof* feeder, not something for feeding squirrels. Wrong description."
3,Not So Squirrel Proof & Pole Kit Not Included,"The squirrels quickly learned how to open the lid. One morning, I awoke to see a large grey squirrel scrunched up INSIDE the hopper, chomping away at the seed! I chased him away, took the feeder down, and made an insert of heavy 1/2"" hardware cloth. I opened the top and crammed the hardware cloth over the seed (I made it to come way up to the top but didn't fill the seed to the top, hoping to discourage the squirrels) and re-hung the feeder. That worked for 2-3 days, until the squirrels learned that once they opened the lid, they could push in the sides of my ""wire cage"" to get to the seeds. So there he was again, inside the hopper, wedged between my wire insert and the window. The squirrels later learned how to remove the insert! My idea didn't work. Secondly, this feeder is usually sold complete with the pole sections, the grounder and hardware for mounting, for the same price as this one. This is the feeder only."
3,Not really squirrel proof!,"As other reviewers have said, it doesn't take long for squirrels to figure out to perch just so in order not to trigger the weight bar and close the door on the seed. I have noticed that big squirrels cannot do this, but younger, smaller ones can. So it does eliminate big squirrels from feasting all day.I do like that larger birds like grackles do not like feeding from it or using it. So it does encourage smaller birds like cardinals, finches, etc. to feed (when a squirrel isn't on it!). So a decent feeder but not all I hoped it would be."
3,Squirrel Proof - Not!,"Just to add to other reviews, if you are looking for a ""squirrel proof"" feeder, this is not for you. While some squirrels seem unable to figure it out, there is always one who does. Quite entertaining to watch, but the intent is to feed birds, not clever squirrels."
3,Locals' London,"This work of sadistic sexuality, robbery, murdering, kidulthood, cannibalism climaxed in Jesus/Maria images constructed from semi-naked half-alive corps belongs exactly to movies of category ""What is it for""?However, locals know better what to show of London, England, worldwide."
3,SLIGHT RECOMMENDATION,LOVED THE SPRAY AS THE GLITTER SHINE ON MY HAIR AND CLOTHES WAS REALLY CHRISTMASY AND MY DAUGHTER DID AS WELL BUT IT IS A LITTLE HARD ON THE LUNGS TO BREATHE IN
3,sparkles,i love sparkles and this is really good. just wish it didn't go all over the place when sparying on
5,Glambert Glitter,I'm a big Adam Lambert fan....and the silver body glitter is the perfect way to get all glammed up for his concerts....I love it!!
4,"A long read, but a good plot",This whole trillogy is pretty good. The reading is excellent. See if you can figure out who Fury and Hydra are before they are given away :). However it does take a while to read these books.
2,Perfect for people who don't actually want a good remote,"Love the iPod. hate the remote.after 2 years, mine finally broke for good. It had a habit of splitting open for some reason.My complaint is the general design - that clip.. it barely works unless you are clipping it to thin material. After 2 years of trying to get it to stay on my bag's strap or my jacket lapel, I am frustrated.I am surprised that no one has produced a better version of it."
3,The weakest link in the iPod experience...,"The iPod remote is probably the weakest link in the iPod experience. The plastic/rubber near the connector does a poor job in keeping the connector from fraying. After about a month or two of daily use, I started hearing static from the earbuds, and after a bit of experimenting, determined that the remote was the cause. If it wasn't for this, it would be a great product, but for a company that pays such attention to detail, I can't believe they missed that one. Otherwise, it is a great way to control the iPod when it is sitting in your bag, a pocket, or on a belt clip. No more digging around to change the volume or to skip an annoying song...The earbuds are great little speakers. They may not fit everybody well, and the covers may make the difference of a snug fit, or being too big for the ear of the wearer. Earbuds may not be for everyone, but they do identify you as an iPodder."
2,Watch out for the connection,"When I first received this, I really loved it. I use a hard case for my iPod, and it was inconvenient to keep lifting the lid to use the controls. It was about a week, though, when the cord cover by the connector started breaking. Since then, I've had to re-enforce the connector several times, and currently have a plastic casing over it with some tape to keep it in place. Not worth the price since it breaks so easily."
1,iPod Remote sucks,"I have owned my Ipod for 18 months. It is the fantastic, but I am now on my 3rd remote which is not so fantastic. No matter how careful I am about twisting the wires,it seems that after a period of time they loose connection with the Ipod. I also do not like the fact that Apple bundles the earphones with the remote. I am forced to buy new earphones just to get the remote."
1,"Good design, but didn't find it too useful","This remote is mostly for outdoor use - very good to navigate the iPod while it is tucked inside your pocket, mostly with the keypad put on hold. Would have been great if the remote was wireless. It is not very useful indoors since you have to get near the iPod to operate the remote - you might as well put your fingers on the iPod itself.This used to come free with the 3G iPods, along with the leather case (that's how I got it!). I hardly use it since I have a wireless remote (NaviPod).Looks like it has been designed to work well with the Apple iPod carrying case. This is because, with the Apple case, there is no way to access the iPod controls when the iPods is inside the case. This remote has all the controls (except that we can't see the display), and a hold button on the side. It also has a simple clip to fasten it to your clothes.If your habit is to put a long playlist and play it while jogging, working out etc., this remote could be useful."
4,Barbara Dane on Don Ewell CD,"Those Barbara Dane fans looking for more by her should look up a CD titled ""Denver Concert"" under Don Ewell. Ewell is a great pianist and this concert is just the two of them together. Dane sings on about half of the songs, with the others being piano solos by Ewell. This was my first exposure to her, being a Ewell fan, and I was blown away by her voice. She's good on the Folk Songs CD, but I think her voice is better on the Denver Concert CD."
5,Must be band politics....no DVD,"I pre-ordered this on DVD in 2007 when Amazon said it was being released. They later sent me an email that my order has been canceled (!)""Though we had expected to be able to send this item to you, we've since found that it is not available from any of our sources at this time.""Neil, I was at this show in Williamsburg, VA and have been patiently waiting 17 years for it to appear on DVD. What's going on? If someone in the band is balking just pay them off and release the DVD......"
1,pure crap,This movie tried to be something. the touble is I don't think anyone knew or had any plan of what this movie was supposed to be about. Nothing happens in the movie. Maybe that would have been a good start. Have something happen in the movie. Put that as the first line. pure crap. I'd give it a zero!
3,Anne Mather,"Caryn just couldn't be sure whether or not Tristan Ross was the father of her dead sister Loren's baby. Surely Loren had been telling the truth? Tristan denied it, yet he was making himself responsible for the child, wasn't he? And then Caryn found herself faced with another problem..."
3,"great idea, but....","This is a terrific concept, unfortunately it is too small to read any of the printing or to find the pieces. They need to include an enlarged copy of the picture so someone can actually read the information! It's ashame, because it has great potential."
5,"Very delicious, many uses","I love this particular vodka sauce. Very delicious, not overloaded with spices, creamy, just enough salt. I use it as a simmer sauce for my meatballs and stuffed peppers and it works out fine, just as if I would make it myself, which I usually did, before I've found this one. Really good."
1,A dud,"Note To Hollywood: STOP MAKING MOVIES OUT OF CLASSIC TELEVISION SHOWS-THEY ARE ALL BOMBS-I.E.,THE MOD SQUAD, AVENGERS, BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, ETC. You are wasting so much time and money(not just the studios but the consumers')."
2,"A Poor Effort, But With Some Enlightening Moments","This was a crumby remake of a bona fide classic television show, and might be considered okay if you never saw the real thing. For old Beaver fans, though, the film had its (rare) moments. Christopher McDonald's portrayal of Ward Cleaver was very close, and he truly shone a couple of times when expressing irritation -- he captured the exact tone we used to hear from Hugh Beaumont, when his ""Ward"" was upset or angry. The effect, though brief, was hilarious.And we realize from this film that Ken Osmond's ""Eddie Haskell"" was a superstar of a television character, an unforgettable icon of teenage obnoxiousness -- and no one in the universe could ever portray Eddie with the same gusto, spirit and benign teen sleaze as Ken Osmond did.It's time for the old Beaver episodes to be put on DVD, so new generations can enjoy them."
5,the movie was great,I loved the movie it was really cute I loved Erick in it he is my favorite actor
1,"Gee wiz, Wally. That was a bad movie.","This was one of the worst movies ever made. I enjoy watching the Leave it to Beaver shows, but the characters in the movie were nothing like they are in the shows. I was very dissapointed. Also, Eddie Hascel in the movie was a terrible actor."
1,We want the original Beaver!,"When I searched on ""Leave it to Beaver"" I was hoping to find the original episodes. So many t.v. shows are now available on sets of DVDs, I thought for sure Beaver would be. After all, it is one of the most popular shows ever. How disappointing. I guess we can only hope the owners and current producers see fit to put it out in that form...soon! I can't imagine it not making them a tidy sum."
1,Crack addicted monkeys could do better.,The movie abandons Beaver as the main character early in the movie to follow elder brother Wally's discover of the opposite sex. This movie has none of what made the TV series a classic. By the end of the movie I was fantasizing about the abrupt end this movie should make of the carreers of Andy Cadliff and the writers that churned out this steaming heap of trash.
1,"""Hey, Wally,I Think We Got Tooken""","""Yeah,Beav, this is a real gyp."" This sad effort resembles the original in name only; the cast, script, and direction all reek of pure incompetence, and the ineptitude of all those connected with this film is clearly demonstrated at every turn. This horrific mess is nothing less than a travesty."
5,I thought Leave it to Beaver was funny!,"I saw this movie on the Disney Channel, a week ago and I liked it. I am going to look for it on video and get it. It's one of my favorite movies of 1997. I think it's a fun, entertaining, family film."
4,A 50's and 60's family are stuck in the 90's.,"If you are wondering why I am giving this movie 4 stars, is the characters in this movie, for example, in the movie Eddie Haskell is shorter than he was in the tv show, Theodore Cleaver Aka Beaver's friend Gilbert is white in the tv show but is black in the movie, and more.As the movie opens, Beaver (Cameron Finley) wants a bike. And his brother Wally Cleaver's (Erik Von Detten) best friend Eddie Haskell (Adam Zolotin) tells him to to something to make his old man proud. Like play football and his dad will buy him the bike and then quit the team after he has it. Beaver does to that. And when Ward Cleaver (Christopher McDonald) gets home, Beaver helps him and Ward thinks Beaver has done something wrong, all Beaver wants is his father's hands free to sign his permisson slip to play football."
3,Tough reading,"The author of this passed away several years ago, and I was one of the few privileged enough to work with and publish with John M. Cowley. As one of the leaders in the field of electron microscopy, it is to be expected that he publish a textbook in the field. I received my copy from him personally in the summer of 1997, and spent the next year or so reading through it. The book is quite advanced, and should not be attempted by someone without a strong undergraduate training in physics and mathematics. The text is written for those who already have some knowledge of the subject, and I would not recommend it for someone new to the subject of diffraction or microscopy. As a textbook, it is appropriate for graduate students, and is well done in that the sample problems can be finished without the need of a computer. Overall, an OK book from a great author."
4,Even a cinnamon twist is not this good!,"I had no idea what I was getting into when I got this movie. As a huge foreign film buff there I was taking a gander at this movie and realizing the script was totally hilarious.Basically it focuses on this married couple who have two children, a French family. And of course, the man, not wanting to offend all of the women he's ever met, sleeps with them all. (Side note, it is actually a compliment when men make passes in France, it is offensive to not do it, it means the female is not worth trying with; interesting huh?)Anyway, hubby cheats, the devoted wife finds that a dyke passerby can fix things, be there for her, and even have dinner.A steamy romance ensues with the wife and her new woman and the cheating hubby does not take it to well.You will laugh your ass off in this movie! I don't want to spoil it, but suffice it to say, I bet the script writer has had a very interesting marriage!"
4,Victoria is terrific gay or straight,"This movie is really main stream. I thought it was so funny and ironic. Victoria's hubby cheats on her left and right. She's already forgiven him once now she feels like a fool. He dosen't know his best friend let the perverbial cat out of the bag and told Victoria about his exploits. So as a ""twist of fate"" a van breaks down in front of Victoria's house the woman asks for help and that starts the hilarious chain of events that ensue. I really enjoyed this movie, it's not really a gay movie, it's about deep friend ship and commitment to a person, straight or gay and if you're open to it, your life can change for the better and be more exciting than you ever thought,and people you meet can change your life in more ways that you can imagine you can grow as a person and be the better for it."
3,Distasteful and unpleasant but pervertedly funny,"PS: I just watched the movie for a second time and I am up-rating it because the acting is so good and the plot is so clever and funny, in a perverted way. Maybe I should be able to lighten up and try to enjoy such farces.My original review: OK, the philandering husband deserved to have his wife pay him with his own coin--by alternating between him and a drug-ridden lesbian. Granted. While the threesome may be logically just, the result is the destruction of a marriage that could be saved. Moreover, nobody asks about the impact of this bizarre threesome on the children. The idea that the husband would make a deal with the fat ugly lesbian to make her pregnant strikes me as grotesque and sickening. No, i didn't enjoy this concoction, politically correct as it may theoretically be."
4,Fun and stylish,"A feelgood movie that only the French could make. Or maybe the Italians. I saw it on TV and hugged myself with so much glee I bought the DVD. The clothes are stylish, the setting sunny and the outcome just right. Alain Chabat is marvellous as the spoiled but charming cuckold, and the two women are perfectly cast for sparks to fly. A romantic comedy for the 21st century."
3,Not very practical but ok,"This book is ok, the forward is helpful and well written, but many of the recipes are a bit fancy and esoteric for everyday family cooking. Also they tend to use a lot of ingredients that are a bit pricey considering you only need a small amount for the dish. I think the book is fine for someone who likes their dinners to be like those found in fancy restaurants, but not for the anerage person who wants to cook healthy simple food."
5,A perfect ZONE PERFECT cookbook!!!!,"The presentation, recipes, photographs are all tops. We love this cookbook and would give it ten stars if there were more than five available!!!"
1,Don't bother,"I disliked this book so much, I returned it. Do I really need a recipe that says: banana, ice cubes, yogurt--put in blender?"
2,zoned out,not satisfied with the recipes I tried.Either they needed a sauce because it was too dry or they needed spices for taste. Will try to return this book
2,"Disappointing format, content","I have to admit, I didn't actually cook anything out of this book, so I can't comment on how anything tastes. I was so dissapointed in that the recipes didn't include any nutritional information other than the 'balanced portion' block information. Also, most of these recipes are for 1 serving! Some of the dinners were calculated for 4 servings, but they were in the minority! I'm just not interested in multiplying the recipes out every time I need to make a grocery list or prepare a meal to figure out what I need. I was looking for a way to prepare zone meals using food readily available in grocery stores (had to look up what steel-cut oats were), and not by adding zone perfect protein powder to everything. I normally use cookbooks by Oxmoor House (Southern Living, Cooking Light), and for now I'll continue to do so. This one's getting returned."
4,An excellent performance of songs from the 50's.,"Jeff Harnar's CD is a welcome compilation of hit songs from the 50's that have become standards. Jeff has an appealing voice, and you know that he is singing each word with all the feeling that he can muster.Yet, there are no phony dramatics. If there ever was an album you can listen to continually, this is it."
3,The Worm in the Apple,"This is vintage Teddy Wilson, an excellent pianist who performed with Benny Goodman in Goodman's landmark 1938 concert at Carnegie Hall, and recorded successfully well into the 1950's. On this album, recorded in 1945, he is joined by Red Norvo on vibes and a skilled rhythm section featuring Remo Palmieri on guitar. Especially for a recording by a pickup group, this is really very good. Wilson brings freshness to the tunes, which are all standards except Flyin' Home, a staple of Benny Goodman's small groups.The problem is Charlie Shavers, a journeyman trumpet player who gets a lot of air time on this album and doesn't make very good use of it. Somebody slipped up, and Shavers is too loud. His style tends to blare, so what we get, unfortunately, is some loud blaring.Three stars for fine performances by all the other musicians."
2,Overally academic,"There were some points of interest in this bok but to be honest I was disappointed. It was written more like an academic thesis. It was very wordy, taking an exceptional amount of time to say not much. There was a lot of sub-debate within the text. The author in subtle ways was quite complimentary of himself. I needed the information I thought this book would provide for crime fiction purposes. It didn't have enough of what I wanted. I didn't feel on reading this book that I had much insight into the actual mind of a serial killer."
1,beware,"I am curious about the reviews in which plagiarism is mentioned especially where there don't appear to be any bad reviews concerning plagiarism. This leads me to believe there have been other known instances in which Ms. Larson has used others' copyrighted material. The good reviews here at Amazon are suspect and sound as if they were written by Linda Larson herself. (the 'author'). Do your research, and investigate Ms. Larson's claims on her websites because I am personally aware of copyright infringement in the case of another book she claimed to have written. If others are aware of plagiarism on the part of the 'author' in any other published books please feel free to contact me."
3,Good movie,"I bought this because my girlfriend loves the movie and comments when a song on the radio was in this movie. I didn't really read through the track list, but rather just bought it expecting it would have what she wanted. We listened to it together, and I felt like songs just weren't that great. There were some good ones hear and there, but overall I was disappointed. She enjoyed it, but wasn't going crazy or anything. I think there are some songs missing off here that were in the movie."
4,"Great CD, but missing many good songs from the movie",Does anyone know the name of the song being played in the pizzeria when Pam fights Jan? I love this song but cant seem to find it anywhere. Thanks
1,OK if you can stand copy protected CDs,"The soundtrack is a fresh sampling of new music as well as all the major hits of the film. I purchased this CD used while shopping around a used record store. I like the compilation, however, once I got the thing home I couldn't play it on my computer orHome Theater DVD/CD player due to the copy protection. The enhanced portion is interesting for about 30 seconds, and the links lead you to the RCA site to get the first song by Dave Matthews in a 128kb MP3 file. I was hoping to upload these songs to my MP3 player and take them jogging, but now I think I'm going to sell it back to the second hand store. Obviously the copy protection is why it ended up there in the first place."
3,Missing song,Does any one know the name of the song being played in the backround when Sandler is coming into NYC on the helicopter. It was also used in the ads. for Big Fish. I ts a real mellow song and very beautiful. Please help me out
5,you people,You people are crazy. The soundtrack rocks and so does the movie. That movie was great. You people are nuts.
2,"To: A music fan from Statesville, NC USofA",The name of the song and the band when crazy eyes appears is:In the Summertime by mungo jerry
3,"It's a great soundtrack, but missing music","I went right out and bought this after seeing the movie (literally) but was dissapointed to find out that most of the music I remember wasn't on it. Sure there's some good songs on here, but the main ones that I liked/wanted aren't on here. This seems to be the trend with movie soundtracks currently, not putting all the music on them....what is playing when ""crazy eyes"" is on (like his theme or whatever you'd want to call it)..."
2,This upset me.,"I was so upset to find out that this CD only plays the soundtrack part on my old CD player. For some reason my laptop, DVD player & car CD player will only bring up the video parts. Extremely frustrating. Was thinking about sending it back. I do love the music though and don't know what the heck to do about it. Has anyone else had this problem??"
4,This is THE sound evaluation disc.,"If you're really looking for a CD to evaluate the sound of your stereo, then this is the disc for you!! Without a doubt! Just listen and you'll se what I mean. Chock full of solos and drum tracks that'll make your heart pound ."
3,Dry...,"I have a love for trees and forests, so I thought I would love this book as well, but it's so dry that it puts me to sleep everytime I try to read it. It does have a lot of information, but it reads more like a laundry list than a narrative. If you're looking for information, this is your book. If you're looking for an interesting read, look elsewhere."
5,A Dendrophile's Delight,"If you enjoy the myths and folk-tales ,surrounding the lore of trees,then i would like to recommend this arboral classic to you.The problem that some readers may have with the book is the erudite and dated style of the book.Yet,that's the type of book ,i like.There's another difficulty with the book,in a global context.It being written some eighty years ago,it leaves out Native-american,Latin-american,Asian and African myths and tree legends .Completely catering to a European-american audience only.So,keeping that in mind,is really helpful before hand.Nevertheless,it's a wealth of 'enthnodendrography' ,that will entertain and educate all scholars of the 'Dendro-Mythos'."
2,old book,"wow, this is an old book, just re-released. it is written in old english. Very odd and seems to ramble"
2,Sometimes difficult to understand,Sometimes the text is hard to understand. It would have been helpful if the text included some example calculations. The course I'm using this for could benefit from a newer edition/publication.
1,used book selled as new,it's a used bookSpectrochemical Analysisthe picture I upload is what this seller send to me which costs as much as a new one.
5,it's a skateboard...,it's a basic skateboard that was cheap and serves it's purpose. What more can I say? So far it's holding up well.
5,5 Ingredients or Less,I love the idea of just the 5 ingredients since I am so busy as we all are. It came in perfect condition.
2,disappointed,"""Fresh recipes for every season"" it isn't. Maybe they meant ""New"" recipes. My idea of an ""ingredient"" is NOT a can of tomato or mushroom or celery soup, a package of frozen mixed vegetables, milk chocolate candy bars, frozen ravioli, package of this can of that, packaged mix, etc. Then doctored with a couple of spices, condiments or onion. I'm not so stupid I need a recipe book to tell what I might add to some packaged food I bought.HOWEVER, to be fair, if you are someone who uses canned and frozen foods a lot in cooking, on the run, this book IS great for you. Very simple and quick, you'll love it.My fault for not using my head on this one."
3,Gift for granddaughter - new sewing enthusiast,"The price was WAY better (half-price) than shelf prices. Thought this would be a great little addition to a young sewer's supply. She loved it, but it doesn't work quite as nicely as the picture show....thread spools tend to slide off the spindles. Thread is not high quality but satisfactory for a beginner's learning projects and will be replaced with new thread as she gains experience and skill."
2,not the best,"The storage compartment is good, and easy to tote around... On the other hand, the thread is not very good quality. For a beginner it would be ok, but I would not recommend."
1,False advertising!,"I ordered the Singer Sew Essentials Storage system because my previous Singer storage system wore out after years of use. It was an excellent item and the photo on the box is exactly what I was trying to replace. However, that is NOT what arrives. Shame on me for not looking more closely at the photos included in the description. What actually arrives is NOTHING like the picture on the box, but it is exactly like what is shown in the 2nd picture. To think I wasted $28 on THAT! Lesson learned: be careful and understand exactly what is for sale. I will not be shopping from that vendor again!"
2,Great Concept,"I like the idea of this product, but I think it was built very poorly. The plastic that holds it together is flimsy and sad. I'm afraid I may one day break it by simply opening the product. My spindle of thread also fall right out of it as soon as I open it.I someone invents a better put together product. Get research & design at this fast!"
1,Absolutely not worth the money,"I received this as a gift after seeing it in a craft store. Of course, had I opened it and looked at it, I would never have suggested it as a gift. Aside from the obvious cheapness of EVERYTHING in the kit (including the thread, which is a fuzzy low quality), there is no way to open the thing without the thread spilling out. I assumed something with Singer's name on it would be good quality. I was wrong. Any beginning seamstress, child or adult, would be far better off buying a couple small plastic storage bins and supplying their own basic thread colors, needles, etc."
2,Meh.,Cheap. Two of the large thread spools were broken (one had -2- dents... how does one even do that?). I will probably be not using the items provided but will use the case.
1,This item is a hot mess!,"My boyfriend purchased for me, I was delighted! But as soon as you open it, the thread just falls out, there is nothing to hold them in, everytime i opened it I had to spend fifteen minutes cleaning up. So the carrying case is almost useless, maybe it can work left open on your sewing table, and I don't know if its worth it for the thread, but it is the worst design ever. If anyone can tell me any ways to use this and without the spools of thread falling all over the place when opened, I'd love to hear. It is a waste of space.It should be half the price.I don't blame Amazon, this is Singer taking advantage of us sewing fanatics that love nifty accessories!"
3,Awkward,I got this when I purchased my first sewing machine. It comes with a nice variety of threads and accessories. The only accessory I didn't like was the little tomato pin cushion. It is really pointless to use. My only major issue with this kit is it's awkwardness. The drawers constantly fall out of place as I am opening and closing it. Then the spools of thread are always slipping off the rods (even after pushing them all the way down.)
1,A Disappointment,"Very flimsy case, difficult to open without spilling contents all over the floor, not the kind of product I'd expect from Singer"
3,Sewing case,"This is a decent little sewing case, but it is a bit light weight and I wonder how long before it breaks...None the less, I really like the small ""footprint"" when folded up. Most of the accoutrements the which came with it are OK. Even the scissors are decent, at least for now. Lots of nice threads in good colors (but no black or white...hmmmm)A note of importance, this is a SINGER oriented kits, so DO NOT use the bobbins with a Brother machine! I bought others, and they fit in the appropriate compartment.Note 2: the pearl-head pins they supply bend very easily. Get others. And the pin cushion is for show more than use...tiny and tough to put a pin or needle into it!Overall, for the money I think this is an ok kit...just curious how long it will hold up...."
2,Cheaply made...,"I bought this to keep my sewing notions in order and it was a plus to have the thread & bobbins included. The first thing I noticed upon removing it from the box is that if you open the case the wrong way, you end up with the thread spools all over the place. My Main complaint about this product is that the case is very cheaply made. It is plastic and if you were to drop it even once it would break. I am looking for something that is going to last many, many years to come. This does not fit this need."
4,Worked for me,"This actually came with more than I needed. I run a costuming group where I had the machine and the skills, and so had a lot of thread, and so needed some sort of storage system. I promptly pawned all the thread off on my cousin, and set the bobbins aside, as I have a Brother, not a singer, and the scissors are cheap with a raised edge that will rub and start to hurt if you use them too long, so I was not upset when I lost them a few months later. The other issue was that, while fine for normal spools of thread, it is not made to hold the slightly more expensive Guterman threads that I use on my machine. I used an old soldering iron to rectify this by melting down the spokes that caused this issue, and it works great for me now. Given the issues I had with this was not a lack of quality, but rather that it was not quite to my needs, I would say that this is a relatively good buy, especially if your wanting a starter kit of cheap thread, or need to store your old basic spools of thread."
4,reasonable buy,"It was an okay product. I wish however, that the seller would of noted that pin cushion and measuring tape were pink. That would of prevented me from buying the product, never the less, delivery was fast and all of the pieces work well."
4,Nice little all in one.,"You get quite abit for your money. They aren't all HIGH quality, but very useful. It does come with just about everything you need to get started sewing."
5,Very handy item...,"Well made for the price , made by Singer, with all the little items to keep in one place, handy , not to large, can recommend it if you don't have a sewing station."
4,It works,"When I read the reviews I was in doubt when buying it. But it works well for me, there are many options for thread colors, the scissors are good and I like the compartments. I am not a professional and need it for the usual family sewing stuff, so it totally attends my expectations."
3,Great kit for beginners/ Item was not new as advertised.,"Excellent kit for beginners, however the item was used and not new as advertised. Package was in good condition and had all parts accounted for."
3,It's okay,"I got this as a gift and it's okay. Tons of thread and other sewing products. The only issue with this is it's a pain in the butt to open. It does not want to open easily and every time I need something in there, I feel like my fingers are in a wrestling match."
4,Nice kit,"The cae is nice. Has two outside pockets for holding pattern envelopes. The closure is secure and the case doesn't feel flimsy. The contents are helpful. The bobbins work great and the scissors are surprisingly sharp. I can fit a LOT more stuff in it in addition to what came in it, too. The only real room for improvement is that the quality of the thread seems a little poor. I am judging purely on feel, though, as it hadn't jammed my machine or broken, etc."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed by this organizer. The latch doesn't stay shut, causing the thread to tumble out every time I picked it up."
3,Adequate but not great,"The product has what I wanted in it, but some of the items in it were lackluster at best considering the description, i.e. the threaders were so thin and firmly pushed together I thought it was only one, not three, and insufficient for easy use. But all I needed was a few needles and some selection of threads for sewing buttons back on, and a case to keep it in, so for that it works. A tad pricey being that is its only use!"
5,Essential Storage,"This storae bin is great. It even came with all the stuff one needs to sew. Tape measure, pins, thimbles, empty bobbins and all the sewing thread one needs to start sewing. That is really a good buy."
3,Perfect for a beginner,"This storage system has its flaws such as the wing compartments swinging open if not carried with care and the thread spools fall right out of place when case is being opened or closed. The thread spool problem i temporarily resolved by placing rubber bands across each row in order to keep them from sliding out. The swinging of the wing compartments don't really bother me as i don't really take it anywhere and the plastic doors keep everything from falling out of it. What does bother me is that it squeaks so loudly when being opened or closed! I don't recommend this for someone that will be using it frequently, I've had it for about 3 years now and though its still in mint condition will be replacing very soon. Overall its a good buy due to having everything a beginner will need."
4,Great Sewing Item Organizer,A very good organizer for the active seamtress. Well constructed and compact. This was a Christmas present for one of my family members.Would have like to seen more detailed photos of the product before purchasing.
4,Accurate,"Yes, my fellow reviewer, you probably missed the point. This is an Autralian movie made for a large audience. And a good one too. The only criticism I can think of is that it takes more than an hour before the real action starts. A lot of attention is given to the characters and their individual circumstances. Apart from this, The Great Air Race is historically accurate. This is how it really happened. It was 1934 and this race attracted only the most audacious adventurers in the world. Sadly, they left out the second Dutch entry, the Panderjager (panther hunter), one of the fastest planes in the world then. Nevertheless, this is a most enjoyable movie though it takes quite some time to really take off. The end isn't very strong either. Still worth four stars."
1,Great for catching hair,"I bought a pack of these things and all it seemed to catch was my hair whenever I walked by it. We had it hanging for 5 days and it did catch 1 fly, the other 6 we had to swat using a swatter. I am now on the look out for something more effective."
3,Italian leather gloves,"The description was confusing. One description stated that the gloves were silk lined and another said they were unlined. They are also short and exposed most of the wrist. I returned them. I was expecting silk lined. The leather, however, was a quality leather, soft, supple."
3,Good facts and history book,"I was looking to a ""how to"" book, I book which deal with techniques and method and style. I though this book would show me what they actually do. Not just explain the philosophy and list their gear. (Which most people can't afford unless they has huge client like those listed in this book. This aint it.This book does show you who the big boy are, and how their careers has developed. So much is changing in Pro Audio right now, this book let you know where state of the art was, and perhaps where it is going. I'll keep it as a history and philosophy book , not a technique, skills and knowledge book."
2,"""Boring to Boresville"" by Borry McBorringson","I thought this book would give some actual tips or insights into how to run sound for live shows, but it is just a dry tome of various sound guys going over their resumes and exhaustively listing the gear in the PA on their current tour. No anecdotes about the artists whatsover and not even a few ""road tales"" sprinkled in... I can't think of anyone on earth that could find this interesting. Save your money."
3,Not that good,"I like French music and I like female singers. I had listened to some of the songs on this album and liked them well enough to buy it. Now, after listening to it several times, I am not impressed. The music is fine. But there is nothing special about it. It's the kind of pop you find everywhere: turn on the radio and you won't hear the difference from the CD. The lyrics are OK but not great either. Overall, it's solid French pop but not the kind of CDs I'll recommend to my friends, unless they are Zenatti fans."
2,reborn re release,"usually have never had anything negative to say about the music i get through amazon. however when i received the reborn album, the disc itself looks as though it was home made ( green tinted ). gave me the feeling that some kid with a fancy printer and a stack of recordable discs stayed up one night . and whats with the barcode on the disc itself... isnt one enough on the case? the sound seems o.k. though, but tacky and second rate package.not like the original.Jay"
5,Nothing even comes close. LS is KING,"Forget anything you have ever heard about hardcore/metal music, you are about to re-learn. Reborn will blow you away.There is only one word i can find that will describe this album: PERFECT. Every song is so intricate and so precise it blows your mind that it is so brutal. From blending acoustic guitars in the middle of a death metal song to the massive tape loops (used sparingly to good effect), this is the album that made Living Sacrifice ""KING"". Every song will get stuck in your head, and you will find yourself bobbing your head and drumming your fingers long after the cd has stopped playing. This is an absolutely amazing cd.It is time to re-learn everything you know about heavy music. If you are a fan of the genre, and even if you are not (you WILL be, after listening to ""Reborn""), you NEED to buy this cd. This was the album that introduced me to metal, and ever since then, hearing all the other bands, this album is still on the top. Nothing touches it."
2,A True Review From A True Lou Christie Fan,"Let me rephrase the title: A true die hard Lou Christie fan less than thrilled with the sound of Pledging My Love.First and foremost, the problem with this album is not Lou's voice. Lou has one of the finest voices in rock history and still does. I just saw the guy perform live three weeks prior to this review.Here is the problem:The sound of this album is soft pop - a far stretch from the doo wop infused rock n roll flavor that drizzled over this amazing singer's recordings from the 1960's.There are no live drums and the instrumentation is cheesy.If you are a die hard Lou fan, buy this album for your collection.If you are not a die hard Lou fan, try his greatest hits compilations or the albums Paint America Love & Beyond the Blue Horizon.Pledging My Love"
5,Great read,The E version of this book was easy to navigate and read. I would recommend it to anyone with an e-reader.
4,classic,"The text is a classic that everyone interested in insurgency warfare must have in their personal collection. I have taken a few classes that always refer back to this book and so I was expecting to hear all about the mao's three phases of warfare. To my suprise, much of the ""three phase"" terminology was actually from the introduction and analysis of Samuel B Griffith who translated it and provided a detailed introduction in the 1960's. The version that I bought from amazon did not include this introduction so that would be the only thing that would have made my purchase better."
4,Keeping it Simple,"Written in 1937 by Mao, this book focuses on organizing and conducting guerilla operations against the Imperial Japanese forces occupying China.A short and fast read, Griffith's introduction is much easier to read and is more informative than Mao's book. Historically significant but repetitive and slow. Mao keeps it simple and focuses on the most important elements of successful guerilla operations. Simple and low tech are better in most situations.Bottom line...a highly recommended classic, just don't expect Shakespeare."
5,Mao's Handbook on Insurgency,"A must reading for counterinsurgency. Although, some of the material are only relevant to historians such as the appendices with the table of military organizations, the first three are good background on why the Chinese insurgency was successful. As always, take this book with a grain of salt and with readings on the issue, the period, and Mao. This is a book written by a premier communist; many truths were mixed with falsehoods. Although Mao said that the people were not to be compelled to support the insurgency, history has shown that fear was a main weapon of many insurgency including the Chinese one."
1,Don't waste your money,"I usually don't buy inexpensive knives, but I fell for the Schrade name because they used to make quality knives. This is a Chinese made piece of garbage that looks like something you would by for $5 at a shady carnival vendor's tent. The grip is made of hollow plastic and it is held together by a screw, not rivets and the fit and finish is extremely poor. There is not much of a tang extending into the grip as far as I can tell, so I can't imagine that it could take much abuse. The leather sheath is thin and cheaply made. The blade is heavy, but I can't speak for the quality of the steel or how well it holds an edge since I have thrown this in the back of the closet to put in the garage sale bin. Do yourself a favor and save up a few extra dollars and buy yourself a well made knife from someone like Boker or CRKT."
4,Uncle Henry,"This is a large Knife, with a very sturdy sheath, and it is ""EXTREMELY SHARP"" from factory, so be careful, I loke the look of the knife but i didn't like the way the handles were attched to it, the blade is perfect for skinning or anything else you might need in the woods, the butt of the knife was a little loose when I received it, other than that it is an all around good knife for someone beginning to get into the outdoors."
3,Schrade Uncle Henry Knife,"The knife its self is OK, but the grip looks like cheap plastic. Over all I was not impressed ."
2,complete trash!! Really!,"When I received this knife the handle was lose at the top brass trim piece and the knife was so dull you could not butter toast with this extremely bad example of a knife and the scabbard is starting to fall apart, if this unit has a warranty I am not a happy customer!This cheap piece of garbage is not even worth sending in for warranty service it would just be another waste of shipping and repair fees and guess what Schrade YOU STILL SUUUUCK A HUGE UNIT!!! I should not have to put up with this kind of shoddy workmanship! I need to switch to a well made brand of knifes and Schrade is not it, what a waste of time and money Schrade can bite me all day every day you WEASELS!!!"
3,knife and leather case,"the knife is nice, although the handle is made of what seems to be plastic with a screw on one side. The leather case is really nice!! Overall, worth the 25 bucks. Fast shipping from Amazon."
2,Good for the money,The handle of this knife is a big disappointment. It's big - takes a big hand to hold ity and it looks cheap.
4,Uncle Henry Fixed Blade Knive,"After ordering I read some of the reviews and thought I would be somewhat disappointed. For the price it is a great knive, and I'm glad I made the purchase. It looks great and feels great. If the one you purchase is just like the one I just received you shouldn't be disappointed."
3,Okay for the price,"You get what you pay for. This was a fairly inexpensive knife, and the plastic handle's nothing to get excited about; but the blade is substantial and sharp. I wouldn't buy this for any knife collection, but it will do for utility/field work (hunting, fishing, on-the-fly cutting or trimming something, etc.) when a regular pocket knife wouldn't do. It comes with a decent leather sheath that can easily be threaded onto a belt."
4,Classic Steve McQueen.,"Great for lovers of Poker with excellent performances from some legends of old Hollywood. Well scripted, tensioned & current interest as Poker takes hold in Australia - an old gem!"
5,The Cincinnati Kid,"The five star rating was because Mr. Robinson had the jack of spades along, what a picture it was great."
3,Can't put my finger on it,"The film needed to be grimmer or even sordid, but was constrained by its time. I'm not sure Steve wasn't a little old for the part. He didn't look as if he was taking care of himself, anyway. Strong cast, good cinematography, adequate direction, ok script. Not crazy bout' some of the editing. Also, where are the Big Easy accents? Worth watching, if only to study the sublty of the great Robinson. He was a New Yorker when it was New York."
4,The Cincinnati Kid DVD Review,"A good movie, which is not a typical action film by Steve McQueen. It is always a delight to watch Edward G. Robinson and Karl Malden. Very good picture and sound."
5,A terrific movie!,"I rented this movie a few days ago, and I had no idea I would enjoy it so much. It has become a favorite of mine. Steve McQueen is awesome! I love his rapport with the kid that shines shoes. The supporting characters aren't bad either. This is a film that keeps moving the whole time. The ending is most unexpected, and full of excitement. Steve's reaction is very touching at the end. I highly recommend this movie. It's one of the best!"
3,could've been,"This thing could have been as great as Robert Rossen's The Hustler, instead what we get is a second-rateflick by a second-rate director.They screwed up big time when they let the original helmer go, namely Sam Peckinpah, and hired a guy like Norman Jewison, who wasn't even good enough to shine Bloody Sam's shoes."
4,McQueen being McQueen,"A typical McQueen character study. That's why it works. If you are like me you will enjoy this movie. Of course, you don 't know what like me means. What it means is if you like your men to be men, flaws and all, You will like The Cincinnatti Kid. Forget about Ann-Margeret and Tuesday Weld. This film belongs to McQueen. He is ably aided by Malden, Robinson, and a real man's dame, Joan Blondell. One of my favorite films of the 1960's"
5,McQueen at his best.,"McQueen stars in this enjoyable film about a poker player who risks it all on a game of poker. Yes it is similar to The Hustler but who cares, anyway McQueen is superb."
4,A gambler after my own luck,"Well not really. I was suprised this movie was shot on location in New Orleans. Today lots of shows about poker and poker tournaments. This is a great movie about folks in that world, playing for high stakes, and wanting to be the best, the one. I very much enjoyed this movie, especially the end, when the kid really learned what was important in life."
4,"Better than the 7"" Santoku","I have both and find myself using the 5 1/2"" knife much more often. Both are good for cutting vegies but this one is more balanced. I have had mixed luck with the handles as they have gotten older. I always hand wash and dry them immediately after use. However, Henckel is willing to take them back and repair / replace the handles if you find that they crack."
3,Comfortable conclusion,"If you enjoy character development more than the comfort of known likeable characters, than you won't enjoy this one as much as the first one. This gives more the feeling of sitcom rather than a show that stands on its own but that really is the point of folllowup shows. I would say that higher reviews are from more die hard watchers as the first one had a love it hate it following, I think primarily related to the dry sarcastic humor. The first one I bought after seeing a library copy. This one I bought because I liked the first. Had I been able to borrow this from the library, I would not have bought after viewing it."
5,I have this ultra portable DVD and LOVE it.,"This unit is so portable yet has a big 4.2"" WS TFT LCD screen. It fits into my breifcase and packpack nicely. The battery run time is about 2 hours. It comes with car cord and ac adaptor to recharging. The unit is well made but the speaker is a bit small. But i use my earphones and that is not a problem. I can't leave home without it."
4,Nice little DVD player,"We travelled internationally a couple of months ago and the unit really worked well. The kids were kept occupied watching it for hours. The unit looks a little flimsy. However, it seemed to have held well for the travel we have done with it."
3,"Cute and a lot of potential, but lacking.","I really liked the design and layout of this dvd player- very small and compact with built in speakers and various ports that aren't available with other dvd players. However, the material is cheap and you can feel/see that it is cheaply made. The sound quality was lacking, and the unit I received also froze 30 minutes into the movies. It was returned. I recommend the COBY TF-DVD7050 7"" TFT Portable Tablet-Style DVD Player- a larger screen size but still portable enough, and very ruggedly made."
4,IT'S MAGIC,"WELL WAS I SURPRISED,IT REALLY WORKED,AND QUITE WELL I MAY ADD.IT WAS EASY TO USE AND THE RESULTS WAS QUITE AMAZING.YOU COULD BUY THIS PRODUCT WITH CONFIDENCE."
2,Barely useable and sexist.,"The book is okay if you want to create sterotype characters or get some basic layout. The main drawback is the that while it does give some information and a few layouts, some parts are sexist. Many roles are typecasted as male or female. In the child development section it constantly lists males as agressive or addicted to sex almost from childhood while girls are more focused on emotions and shortcomings.It list bachelors as comnpletely mentally disturbed and says nothing about single women whats so ever or the behavior traits they show. Some of the information is misleading and disturbing.It may be good but it could be better if Dr. Edelstein used a more objective approach or reviewed her facts more carefully. It would also helped if she had an extra voice to add to the informaton or someone who isn't biased or misandranistic.Use this at your own risk if you want real 3 dimensional characters."
3,Chapter 14 Missing From Kindle Edition,"I bought the Kindle Edition of this book, only to discover that the last chapter is missing. Chapter 14. Very disgruntled. Don't buy the Kindle Edition if you're looking for the entire book."
5,Writer's Guide to Character Traits,"This book here is fantastic at pointing out every little trait going in people! Profiling has never been easier!!!If writing complex characters in stories, Writer's Guide to Character Traits will aid and contribute further the character.Enjoy!"
2,"I tried to like this book, really I did","The front cover of this book shows a character broken into more than a dozen parts. I felt disjointed, just like the cover, when I tried to work my way through the book. It doesn't flow in any intuitive way and I felt lost even when I thought I knew what I was looking for.I'd like to have a great writers guide to stimulate thought on different personality types, mannerisms, etc. But I'm afraid this isn't the one."
3,Character,This is a good book for people who want to get skin deep with devolping who they are writting about.Though it doesn't have answers to everything.It is an excelent refrense book.
4,Interesting but useless in any practical sense.,"This book is essentially a listing of information about various personality types, and mental illnesses, etc. It's a very interesting read and I enjoyed it a lot. The problem, though, is that for a writer it's kind of useless. One can pick up information on mental illness by reading other books which specialize in the subject. And if you need to be told all these things about people's personalities, then you're probably not going to make a good writer anyway. A writer of fiction needs to know about people and how they work, and if you really need this book then you've got quite a long way to go."
4,Worth Every Dime,Great read and very insightful. I'm a writer and this helps me flesh out my characters.
2,No enthusiasm here.,"This is but a short ""add-on"" to Timothy Kearney's excellent review of this book. I found The Writer's Guide to Character Traits merely another textbook formula for creating wooden people. Stereotypical. Gives you nothing that would enable you to maximize these traits--qualify them for inclusive fitness into your story. At best, this book is good for (occasional) checklist purposes only. Far and away, in my opinion, the most USEFUL book on characterization is Karen Hood's Creating Character Emotions. ##### Before buying this book I would recommend reading Timothy Kearney's review. Re-read it. Then read it again."
2,Too Simplistic,"A good writer is curious about people and how they behave and function. He/she has excellent observation skills. This book will generally not be helpful for that type of writer.There are a few interesting tidbids here and there in this book that may interest those who haven't studied, formally or informally, the field of psychology. However, if the serious writer is interested in learning about psychological disorders per se, they are better directed toward the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) put out by the American Psychiatric Association. As for the rest of the book, it's a noble attempt on the author's part (I gave an extra star for effort--it looks like it took a long time to put this book together), but the canned stereotypic descriptions aren't going to be helpful for the truly observant. Most serious writers will be better off relying on their own insights into human nature."
2,Not much depth,"When reading stories my favorite part is the character development. I always try to question my characters motives while writing. I was hoping this book would help with the psychological aspects I might not be as familiar with. When I opened the book I was greeted with bullet points of common traits of cliché sounding character like 'the Boss'. The entries are short and don't go into enough depth to be useful. Most traits are common sense or at least obvious to anyone who reads enough. It is hardly helpful for characterization and using this book may cause more cliché characters. I am not saying these character traits are not true in some situations, but if you want to make a unique character that stands out to the reader I wouldn't use this book. Before buying I would at least look at the later pages of the 'look inside the book' to make sure this is the type of book want."
5,In depth!,"Wow, it really makes you dig deep to find every possible understanding why our characters will or won't do what they do! This book is a treasure."
2,Warning - product description is incorrect.,"This is an ok movie, but the DVD is not letterbox 1.85:1 as described, it is fullscreen 1.33:1, so don't buy this if you require widescreen. I submitted a product description correction to Amazon some time ago, but it has not been posted. Why do I think the product description is incorrect? I ordered a used copy from an Amazon seller and obtained a refund when it turned out to be fullscreen. Then I ordered a new copy from Amazon. Same problem. Both copies had package graphics identical to the Amazon product image."
3,soleil all grown up,"This is a provactive thriller which has a detective kyle(soleil moon frye) undercover,trying to get info on sean youngs character.It is a confused film,but has soleil moon frye in a adult role in which her acting is good and has her in scenes in which she looks vulnerable and beautiful. The films worth to buy if your a Soleil Moon Frye,if your not ,its still worth watching."
2,I expected so much more,"I was definately disappointed with this devotional. While I appreciated the lighthearted, uplifting approach to daily quiet times I was hoping for something with more depth and insight. I was worried that each daily reading was based on a single verse rather than within the context of a biblical passage. This led to (in my humble opinion) some writings that were slighly out of context with the original meaning of the verse within the biblical passage. Needless to say I'm back on the market for a new daily devotional."
4,Just what I wanted!,"I couldn't wait to get this book ...!I'm a beginner to Bible studies, and am reading devotions to my group when we meet. This book just filled my expectations!These devotions are written by some well-known authors and is spiritually motivating. Each story is short and to the point!...I will also recommend this book to all of the other ladies in Bible study."
3,Devotional,Unfortunately this book was not at all what I was expecting. Next time I will be sure to make use of the samples amazon posts. All in all it's not a bad book just not what expected. I thought it was an actual daily devotional with daily study guide information but it is just a story for every day of the year.
4,Great Devotional,"This Devotional is great, it is filled with stories about life and family, the challenges and the rewards. Bought this for a friend too."
5,Women of Faith devotional,"This devotional made a perfect Christmas present for several of my friends. All of them remarked at how much they appreciate receiving this book and that they are beginning it on January 1. I bought one for myself, also, and will start on 1/1/11."
4,Our fan died,It is hard to give a review of this because the fan in the trash can died. The product was as promised.
4,"if you have the diaper pail, you need the filters...","of all the diaper pails I've seen so far, the First Years Clean Air system is pretty darn good. What makes it pretty darn good, though, are the carbon filters which eventually need to be replaced. Buying these filters via Amazon just so happens to be the best idea since they're so inexpensive."
5,Finally!,"At long last, a biography of Sylvia Plath written by someone who refused to bow to the editorial demands of Ted & Olwyn Hughes, who unfortunately controlled the late poet's estate at the time. Choosing freedom of speech over permission to quote Plath's work, Paul Alexander has produced an extraordinary biography that reveals the true Sylvia Plath as a girl, woman, wife, mother, and most important, author. With interviews from friends and family who had never before spoken about Plath for publication, this is a book that any scholar of Plath's life and work should not miss."
4,Rough Magic,"Paul Alexander's Rough Magic allows the reader to fully understand and enter the psyche of Sylvia Plath from her blissful childhood to her more tumultuous adult years. What I found was very nice about this biography was that it included Sylvia's poetry in a chronological order. It was so helpful to have her poetry included after just reading what her life was like at the immediate time that she wrote that certain piece. Also, by having her writing placed in a chronological order, I found that I could really pick up on how she developed her writing and honed her skills over time.It is very apparent that the work gone into the making of this book was so thorough and in depth. Mr. Alexander did a fabulous job piecing Sylvia's life together in one book. It seems like every relationship Sylvia ever had has been accounted for and analyzied in this book.I recommend this book to anyone who would like a deeper understanding of Sylvia Plath's life and her continuous descent into depression."
4,Valuable account of Slyvia's life.,"Just finished this Plath biography. It really gave me an understanding of what was behind her mental angish and emotional dependablities. It reaked of tragedy and sadness, often bringing tears to my eyes. Slyvia suffered such misfortune, from a cheating, ego-centric husband to arriving at her London flat with two small children and discovering the electric and phone had not been connected. I couldn't put this biography down, and appreciated the way her life was simply presented with little analysis and so clearly displayed what Slyvia must have been going through. Something I value in biographies."
5,Very interesting,"Very interesting book about Sylvia Plath. So often those that feel life the deepest are also tormented by their strong emotions. A difficult life to lead, for herself and those around her. Her poetry can cut to the quick."
3,"Essential, but beware","I learned a good deal from Paul Alexander's work, especially from his research into her early years. When he get to the poetry, however, he really gets bogged down, summarizing poems rather than reallly getting to the heart of them. Sometimes he veers toward sensationalism--as in his account of a supposed abortion Plath had. It is very unlikely that the story is true. I don't think any biography of Plath, though, can do without Alexander's research."
5,A Very Handy Primer for Quick and Accurate Research,"I work with a lot of churches and nonprofits and I am all for anything that gets them using research more! Some of the most influential and admired ministries today were founded on a little snapshot survey research. Conducting a sample survey of just a few people is a good manageable way to get insight into your community if you follow the directions in this book. I very much believe in using larger scale research. But I completely agree that doing snapshot research sure beats the alternative--guessing! The snapshot research is ideal for churches and church planters. On page 103 he even gives an example of how a church, Northway Christian Community Church used a snapshot survey. Hats off to Dr. Corder for making the case for economical primary research."
3,Not the hand cream I'd hoped for,This hand cream has a lovely soft scent and works in easily but really did not solve my dry hand issue. The positive effects wore off within minutes. Disappointing.
4,Works So Well You Forget That It Smells Like Diaper Cream,"I received a tube of this hand cream a few years ago and never used it because I thought it smelled strongly like a diaper cream. Ironically, once my first daughter was born I was desensitized to this smell, started using the cream religiously, and fell in love with it for its effectiveness. My daughter is now 2 years old and her cheeks flare up with excema whenever she gets sick, and this cream is the ONLY thing that clears it right up. Also great for keeping my hands from getting dried out from being washed so frequently. Great product!"
5,Best Lotion for both guys and gals,"First of all I am a guy and yes I bought this after some sampling it from one of my friends. I have very dry skin (due to weight training and having sensitive skin) and I have tried a lot of lotions to get rid of my dry skin and so far the only lotion that worked was Eucerin but that lotion was way too oily as it left my hands greasy. Now comes l'occitane which leaves my hand moisturized and no more grease after applying the lotion. It is simply one of the best lotions I have used. But, no product is perfect so here are my gripes:1. Costly2. I don't like the smell3. Cap is too smallOther than that you won't find a better lotion out there that not only heals very dry skin and being grease free. Recommended for all skin types for your hands."
5,Worth Every Penny,"This is the best hand cream I have found. Thick and rich, and not greasy. Absorbs easily. It is the only thing I have found that keeps my hands from cracking in the winter. Never want to be without it."
5,"If you can't go see them, hear them - loud!","Best: Go listen to this heartbeat live. (I did it twice and do it again). Second best: Use good and big speakers and feel the impact. Bandleader Leonard Eto writes for one of his other CDs, the drums sound like fruit crates if your speakers are not up to it. But if they are - goood. You want the room for yourself and absorb the pulsating life expressed in the delicately complex patterns of impact."
1,"Music is great, but the recording is poor","This is the live recording of some great music. However, it was manufactured from a two-track master tape, recorder with a single-point microphone. I believe the playback quality suffers because of this."
1,unbelievably badly written,"I bought this book to prime me for a trip to Italy and figured that with 4.5 stars is had to at least be readable. I was wrong. The writing comes off as frankly immature: the writer is trying too hard with her imagery, and not paying enough attention to her plot details. (In one paragraph, Edward takes a sip of the champagne and then a few sentences later, calls the waiter over to open it - good trick! And that wasn't the only one.) There were numerous copyediting failures as well, which are just annoying. The characters are not at all compelling. I almost never fail to finish a book I've started, but I just couldn't waste any more time on this one. I'm going back to ""A Room with a View"", and looking for some more worthwhile fiction set in bella Italia."
5,Feast for Students of Renaissance Art Plus More,"This mystery novel set in Italy is a feast for the intellect and the imagination! With strong female characters and rich descriptions of Italian art and architecture, it is a perfect complement for any art history study abroad course in Italy. I found it helpful for teaching students how to understand interdisciplinarity, as Van Houten seamlessly weaves art history with feminist and literary theories."
5,A Feast of Small Surprises,"I couldn't put this book down! There are lots of twists and turns that made me want to read just one more page...just one more page...I spent the better part of the weekend putting most everything else aside so I could keep reading Feast. Very interesting characters, and dense with art history, food and wine references and the culture of Italy. Made me long for another trip to Rome."
4,A Feast Of Small Surprises,Again and again there are wonderful descriptions to caress the reader along. I look forward to each time I pick up this book to continue on the journey. The references to art and place are exquisite. Angelika Pschorr
3,Funny,This is a really funny cd if you understand french... Not as funny as Perusse first cd but almost. Très comique!
2,Not a fan,"Some ""Then and Now"" books are well-researched and put together. However, this one is a disappointment.Troy is a lovely city that, while it has seen better days, is not the blight that the book makes it appear to be. None of the ""Now"" photos are very compelling. Some of the ""Then"" photos are interesting, but some look very familiar to me. A greater variety of photos would have helped, such as more of the industrial complexes, factories, train tracks, roundhouses, etc. To me, the street views are not very interesting or informative.I used to be a fan of ""Then and Now"" books, but they have lost favor with me after viewing some of the recent ones that feature the Capital District."
3,Maybe not for Julia Stiles fans...,"As a Julia Stiles fan I expected to really enjoy this movie, I am sad to say that I did not. They acting was fine, the story although predicatable had its moments, but as a whole the movie never took off for me. I think my disappointment came from a lack of the Julia, not enough of her smiles or wit showed up in her character. If you are considering buying it to add to your Julia Stiles movie collection, I recommend you rent it first."
5,carolina,"love this movie. i don't have 14 more words. that's it, i love it. what more do you want me to say. hee."
4,Quirky Comedy,"I am a fan of off beat indie films and this one did not disappoint. A friend of mine recommended this one to me and I thought it had an interesting cast. The young guy from Jurassic Park III was one of the lead characters and he was much better in this movie and Shirley MacLaine was hilarious. Some of her lines are zingers!!! It was a nice DVD and it probably would have been better to see this one in a theater. If you liked Jodie Foster's HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS, then you would probably like this as it is kind of a trailer trash cousin."
2,Sense: This movie made none,"good grief- I don't even know where to begin.I'm a fan of Julia Styles, and generally enjoy her movies. I like romantic comedies. I like goofy oddballs in films. I should have liked this movie- but no. No, no, and no.Carolina's next door neighbor writes romance novels under a pen name- they are best friends blah blah blah. It's a romantic comedy, so you know where this is going, right? What they don't do is explain why they are just buddies- why had they never dated? no explanation.The aunt who is a high class madam? why?The dog that we've seen all of once running rampant on the Thanksgiving dinner table? Beats me.do yourself a favor and do not watch this."
4,A jewel...,I didn't see any reviews or previews for this movie at all. Surprising because it was pretty good. Julia Stiles and Shirley MacLaine work well together as grandmother and granddaughter. It's a touching tale of one dysfunctional family's life. It has it's fun (and touching) moments and I would watch it again.
4,Carolina,"The characters are well rounded and likeable. Great writing. There were quite a few scenes that could have been predictable, but were given a fresh perspective. I recommend this movie if you want to watch quality acting and an entertaining storyline."
4,Vintage Shirley!,"An enjoyable film --- a bit rowdy and brash --- but it was fun watching Shirley MacLaine a bit over the top in the role of the grandmother. An excellent performance by several young actors and actresses, and in particular, Julia Stiles."
5,Mary O'Hara's Songs of Ireland,"I already own this recording on cassette. My local record store told me that it was unavailable on CD. I plan on upgrading to CD fairly soon because I listen to this tape so often I have worn the writing on the case. Mary O'Hara's renditions of traditional Irish folk tunes are hauntingly beautiful and bitter sweet. If you are looking for something to laugh or cry with, this is the one! The use of her harp as accompaniment only adds to the flair of the Irish style and resonates with her voice. I can not recommend this recording highly enough to anyone looking for good Irish folk music."
3,Good advice,"Quite honestly, when I ordered this book it was not the one I thought I was ordering from the 1970s, so right away I was disappointed. It has good, useful tips--it's just not the book I was ooking for."
4,Guiding Kids,"I read this book 20-years ago when my son was born just before I turned 50. I remember thinking back then how useful the book would have been for me and my other two children if it was available when I was 27. A 40-year old friend of mine's wife is having is having a baby for the first time and I knew that this book would be useful to them. I truly believe that the older the father is when the child is born, the better off the child. Hey, guys, it's never too late to have that baby."
5,Why didn't this movie get a theatrical release?,"I saw this movie at the Sundance film festival 2 years ago and I loved it, and was very surprised that it was never released. It is very enjoyable and sweet, and the actors are terrific!"
4,The Magic School Bus in Concert,"The Magic School Bus in Concert is a good game, except the voices are different than the hit TV show, and Arnold, Wanda, Tim, and Dorothy Ann aren't included in the game. I am 10 years old, and I collect Magic School Bus computer games. I would recommend this game for 6 to 10 year olds who want to improve their music skills."
4,fairytales,Great old time stories. Cute and for all ages. Nice family book to share. If your like to read short stories this is a great collection.
3,FOLK TALES,"clever stories, some times with a moral but the morals may be difficult for a younger child to understand. The print was very small, made reading it more difficult. My 11 year old grandchild has not read the book yet so I don't know how it will be received."
3,Why haven't I heard of American fairy tales before now?,"This book caught my attention because I'd never heard of any american fairytales before now. I read the book in it's entirety out of curiousity, but it wasn't that great, especially compared to L. Frank Baum's other work."
2,"Good future vision, too preachy","THE CASSANDRA EFFECT is set in a near future (mid-twentyfirst century) England. Overpopulation has become a major problem, huge corporations rule as the cabel, and plague wars have replaced the bomb as the great fear. Author Brian Stableford draws out logical consequences from today's biological sciences with discussions of disease, cloning, and population spikes.Unfortunately, Stableford describes this potentially fascinating world through long blocks of descriptive dialogue, internal dialogue, and description. Rather than have information flow from the story, it is presented to the reader in huge slabs which must be choked down if one is to continue with the story.I wanted to like this book more than I did. I find the premise interesting, the plot was certainly fine, and the one significant character, Lisa, a police officer and biologist, was likable and well motivated.I found the dense writing to be a fairly stiff price to pay for an intriguing concept."
3,GIVE ME A BREAK!,"The themes in The CASSANDRA COMPLEX are much too complex (overpopulation,longevity,biological warfare). The story as told by an emotionally confused, female forensic pathologist is very confusing. The book would have been easier to digest if it were read back to front. That everything came out nicely in the end was contrived and not motivated by any of the character's actions. Everything just sorted itself out in the last few pages. Well made stories show great craft but rarely enlighten the reader..."
4,Very Nice,"The birds love it and it does keep the big birds out. But.......like all feeders, when it rains the seed gets clogged in the bottom and makes a mess."
2,Light tenor mumbles sea chanteys,"Warning: this is the same album as his reversed-title ""Sailing and Whaling Songs,"" available with a different cover.A good set of chanteys, but badly presented; Clayton's got a light, unemphatic tenor, tends to trail off and mumble, and accompanies himself with light modern guitar that doesn't add to the ambiance.However, if you prefer that light style to either (my favorite) a chorus of rough baritones or a smooth British men's choir, then this may be for you.Me, I'm not gonna bother to keep mine."
2,Not his best,"In the years before his suicide, Paul Clayton did some great work, especially in ferretting out obscure material and breathing life into it. Unfortunately, this particular album lacks the vitality of his earlier work, and portrays some great songs with a sense of weariness that belies the roaring energy that these songs demand."
5,Classic Album of Sea Shanteys,"Do not be put off buying this album by some of the other reviews here (a choir of British baritones, I ask you...0.This is one of the greatest folk albums ever made, by an artist with an unimpeachable knowledge of the historical background to these songs and, through his New Bedford heritage, an innate feel for this material.All of Paul Clayton's albums are growers (he was an incredibly subtle singer), which is why, perhaps, he never had the commercial success he deserved."
3,FOR P.C.R.I.P.,"I first heard of Paul Clayton only recently in a book about Bob Dylan from R.Shelton. PC was on that famous station wagon ride when Bob wrote ""Chimes of Freedom"" WOW. So I looked him up in Amz.com and sure enough there were some CD's there. PC died in 1967, so not only are these songs old from a historical point of view, they are dead from this artists point of view. I liked the music for what they were. His voice is mellow and he captures the era of the times. So long lost pal o' mine."
5,inspirational,"I attended Jillian's lecture in Hazlet, New Jersey on Sept. 6 and she was very inspiring. I was with my sister; whom convinced me and a few other ladies in our circle to go. I have around 80lbs to lose and have been struggling with weight issues my entire life. Jillian was nothing like I expected. I was even a little intimidated going there thinking she would be so strict and acting above us all when in fact she was the opposite! Warm, understanding, funny, self-deprecating and she made ""me"" feel like a million bucks. She stayed after the lecture to speak to each of us individually and had kind encouraging words for all of us. I wish I lived closer to her - I'd recruit her as my trainer. p.s. they showed her fat photo on season one of the biggest loser - she still looked very pretty anyway in my opinion."
5,winning by losing,"Excellent book, have already lost 2 pounds following the advise Jillian gives in her book. If you follow her instructions with not too much cheating you will be feeling and looking much better in no time. Really liked that she divided the book in 3 key areas so it is interesting to read different areas at different times. Only one issue with the book it should have more color photos."
3,Winning By losing,The book is good and true facts it was just a very slow read and I would lose interest and would have to try and read it again.
5,Jillian's first book - winning by losing,"Jillian's first book is fantastic! I read this book, highlighted and referred to it often when beginning my journey to health and fitness. I highly recommend it for anyone starting out who has more than 20 pounds to lose."
4,Missing Link,"I like the total package this book offers. I've been on a pretty challenging exercise routine for a couple years, but couldn't shake the last few pounds. The nutrition section of this book did the trick. It taught me the best foods to eat for my personal type of metabolism and makes it very easy to understand. I also found the sample exercise section of the book very useful in changing up my routine."
5,Good information.,"Jillian Michaels, a personal trainer by trade address reader's weight loss goals on a one on one approach with the author sharing her own weight lose issues followed by actual exercises to tailor the reader's workout and diet to reach their goals. Good information."
4,Great information,I really like this book. Jillian helps you alot with how to properly lose weight. Try her exercise videos as well.
3,It's been done before,"If you've never read a health and fitness book before, this would be just as good as many out there because it gives you all of the basics. But if you are looking for new information, don't waste your money. Everything in this book has been written by others before."
2,This was not helpful for me,I personally don't think this book is necessary for anyone familiar with basic weight training exercises or who has basic nutritional knowledge. Jillian is inspiring and knows her stuff. This book was too basic for my needs.
5,A must have for anyone trying to lose a significant amount of weight,"Great, well researched content. I was so impressed with my copy that I purchased another copy (because I wanted to hang on to mine) for a friend who was also embarking on a weight loss journey and had many questions. With her own copy she can highlight and dog-ear the bits of information she finds that fit with her situation.A weight loss bible."
5,Very informational and...,"...motivational. I love how Jillian breaks weight loss down to 3 sections and initially starts with the area most needed-- which is why we are having problems with our weight in the first place. I did not even know who Jillian was until this year when a coworker started watching The Biggest Loser and I was forced to watch along with her. However, I soon got hooked on the show and it wasn't long after that I realized this lady knew her stuff!Her 3 pronged approach to weight loss, health and fitness is basic, yet well written and thought out and very easy to understand and follow."
4,growing old but staying young,"This book will help you understand the numbers game. I took this book to my personal trainer for questions and answers and she was not quick to give it back because she liked it so well. Jillian is tough but to the point and I like that. If you are ready to believe loosing weight is a numbers game, you want to eat good dietary food, and you know you have to exercise to loose weight and begin a different life style, purchase this book. Because frankly after all these years there are just not gimmicks, just facts."
4,Jillian is hilarious and informative,If you are a fan of the Biggest Loser then you will get Jillian's humor in the book and also that she is a hard core trainer who will drill knowledge into your head for your own sake. This book is informative and gives you a good approach to starting weight loss and will keep you smart about choices.
4,Good Common Sense!,The book was very informative and made alot of sense......you just have to take the time to take the 'tests' in the book and figure out what foods work best for your body type. I liked the food groups as the eating plan was fairly broad and not restrictive to a point that you feel unsatisfied.
1,"not believable, diet is unsafe","my nutritionist agrees that this is an unsafe diet program that might have helped someone lose some weight after pregnancy but would not keep the weight off...the tv show is silly, rather ridiculous...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS, it is a GIMMICKY program."
5,Comprehensive Weight Loss,"The great thing about this book is that it addresses weight loss from many different angles. It starts with the emotional issues involved. Jillian seems to be able to cut through everything and get to the root of why you became overweight. I've read a lot about weight loss, but this is the first book that seems to touch on everything I needed."
5,Informational,"What I like so much about this book is the fact that it is interactive. It has formulas and quizes to help you identify how many calories you burn in a day, how many calories you burn doing all different types of exercise, what types of foods you should be eating and which of the popular diets are ideal for you and why. It even gives you a weight chart so you can define your weight loss goals. There is nothing missing from this book. Jillian has chapters on label reading, eating out, a detailed 12 week exercise program. Seriously, for the person willing to do the work - you can't go wrong here because she puts the power in your hands!"
3,Not what I was looking for,"It is good information but the entire workout is based on weight lifting. There are photos of the equipment,useless without a gym membership. I am looking for something that I can do at home, there is no gym in my town and I cannot afford to buy such equipment."
1,Waste of money!,Don't waste your money buying this book! The information in it is the same stuff you can read in any fitness magazine.
5,Definitely worth buying,I am a huge Jillian Michaels fan and love watching her on The Biggest Loser. I gues you could say she is my fitness idol. There are so many good tips on diet and exercise. I just love it!
3,Works great but room for improvement,"I need the ability to operate my MP3 player remotely because I use it mainly while jogging and motorcycling, activities in which I have the player tucked away and the controls not easily accessible. I have no problems with the functioning of the remote and I love it for that reason. However, the mechanism is so tiny that the markings are hard to see, and the clip is so small that its use is limited. You can't clip it onto a heavy jacket, or even a thick elastic waistband. If you clip it onto thin material such as a tee-shirt, it can come off more easily than it should. Also, now that I have been using it for almost a year, the sound cuts on and off when the wire moves. Creative should be able to come up with a better design and a heavier-duty clip and wires."
4,A little spendy....,"over all, this is a nice bed. The directions were awful. I've put together a lot of furniture and this piece by far had the worst instructions. The holes did not match up completely. Once assembled, it looks nice but you can tell the holes did not match up. It looks as if it is warped. There were scratches on some parts of the wood. On the good side, my son loves it, it matches the rest of his furniture and it looks nice."
1,Making Money with Baseball Cards,I bought this book through you used.The book was outdated and not very useful. Nothing about selling online etc. It was too old. Wish I had not bought it.
4,Forgotten Meoldic Rock from the 90's,"Borrowing heavily from Cheap Trick, ""the Glory Hounds"" blast through a pretty solid batch of melodic power pop like we didn't get to hear much of in the 90s. The best songs are memorable and the weakest songs still aren't bad, making this a consistant album. Fans of other Cheap Trick inspired bands like Enuff Z'Nuff and Marvelous 3 should definitely check this out."
2,WRONG PART AND BOTH FOR SAME WHEEL,WHEN WE ORDERED THIS IT SAID IT FIT A 1999 F150 WELL WHEN WE GOT IT? IT WAS TO LITTLE AND IT WAS 2 OF THE SAME? JUST WOULDN'T RECOMMEND. HOWEVER WE DID GET THEM RETURNED WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS.
3,It's just okay...,You can find the same info free online. I didn't learn anything new by purchasing this booklet.
2,Good pamplet for the clueless,"This pamphlet has 12 briefly explained points on how to be the leader of your dog. Most of them are obvious. Actually there wasn't a single thing in this pamphlet that taught me something new. You can learn all of this through a google search of NILF (nothing in life is free). Some of the tips are: don't alpha roll your dog, initiate play and end it, teach your dog to heel, don't let your dog demand attention. Most people know these things, I think? I knew the pamphlet was short but I thought it would have some insightful tips and commentary, but nope. This may be worth 50 cents, but not 4 bucks."
3,Somewhat Helpful Booklet,"There is definitely some helpful tips in this little booklet on how to convey to your canine companions that you are the leader of their family pack, but most of it was information I'd already come across in other puppy rearing/dog training books. The information was simple and to the point, so if all you want to know about is how to be the leader, then this book is for you. I think I would have liked this book much better, however, if there had been a more thorough discussion of what's going on in a dog's mind in respect to what they're looking for in a leader, how to tell if your dog is truly trying to lead you (and not just taking advantage of a leadership void), etc. When ordering this book, I hadn't paid any attention to how many pages it contains, so I was expecting more."
1,Too little for too much,I wish I had known this pamphlet (definitely not a book) was only 15 very sparse pages long because I would not have ordered it. The word descriptions of actions to be taken are very hard to understand with no sketches or photos. It seems more like a book review or outline of a book that is yet to be written.
2,Not worth paying for,The information in this PAMPHLET is in all of her books so not even worth paying for. Altho I love her approach to training and she has much helpful info in all of her books I felt this was just an effort to get a few bucks extra.
2,How to be the leader of the pack,"I have a 7 pound, 5 month old dog and thought this book would help with training. However, most suggestions seemed to be geared toward large dogs and would never work for my tiny pet. So, for me, it was a waste of time."
1,Not worth it,"This ""book"" is about 10 pages long. It contains nothing that you couldn't easily find with one google search.I am a big fan of Patricia McConnell but this book was lacking and definitely not worth the money."
2,A ripoff for a book,"A tiny little pamplet 8"" X 5"" with 14 pages. There was very little information found in this. But I noticed in almost every thing I read that to train your dog you need a large amount of treats to feed them for every time they move in the direction you were hoping they would. It sounds like you would have to work with them for a lot of time and would have a pretty fat pooch when you managed to get him trained in the basics, and you would have to have him all to yourself to accomplish this. In other words it would be about as cheap to send him to obedience school. I was not pleased at all with these books/pamplets."
2,Patricia going for the money,Vauge platitudes designed for sale to frustrated pet owners; worth less than a bowl of pet food.
3,Don't put all your eggs in one basket,"She has some good points for the beginning dog trainer, however she is not right about pinning dogs down. They do in fact do it in the wild, it is NOT always by choice as she states in her book. When looking at books, be critical as everyone has their own point of view. Stubborn thinking dogs like the livestock guardian breeds need pinning at times, though it's usually through play to maintain your dominant possition.Otherwise she is good."
4,How to be the Leader of the Pack,"Informative but I didn't learn as much as I thought I would have however I have been reading the ""Dog Whisperer"" series which is superior."
1,Skinny little disappointment,Hardly more than a pamphlet - something you could pick up free at the Vet's office. A rip-off. Also nothing new or enlightening contained therein. Don't bother.
1,RIP OFF,"This is the biggest rip off yet from AMAZON I paid over 8.00 for a 6 page PAMPHLET!!!I was so shocked when this ""book""came to me in an ENVELOPE I did not know what to do.Besides that,this has no information in it that dog owners don't already know.A 5 year old knows more than this ""book"" tells you.Do not purchase anything from this writer,you will be very disapointed."
1,not my style,"This is really just a pamphlet, not a book. Felt a little gyped on that.I didn't like her training methods. Not for me."
3,Okay,"We found some useful tips in this book, but we haven't picked it up again to refer to it like we have with others."
2,very tiny booklet,"don't be fooled and think it is a book; it is a bookLET, as stated and is very thin. did have SOME good information, though."
5,So very worth it!,"The reviewer who called it the Cliff's notes for Obedience 101 is probably right, but that's exactly what I needed. This book(let) is short and straight to the point, and I learned more in the half hour it took to read it than I've learned from every other (much longer) dog book I've read and HOURS of watching Dog Whisperer. So, if you've already taken your dog to ""puppy school,"" you might know all this stuff. If you haven't, buy this book for less than $5 and learn SO much!"
3,"This is a pamphlet, not a book, but still good","Readers should be forewarned that this is a short pamphlet meant to summarize some good information about dogs and their relationship with humans. It is not a book, so be careful that you understand that. The purpose of the brevity is that this is something that you can pass to a spouse or family member (who would not be inclined to read a book about dogs) and hope that they would learn something useful from the brief format...perhaps a good opener for a discussion about handling pooch behavioral problems. It is a good summary of information for the uninitiated, but most dog lovers will learn little new here.By all means get one of her other ""real books"", such asThe Other End of the Leash: Why We Do What We Do Around Dogsand you will be satisfied, I'm sure!"
4,great for beginners,"This is a good pamphlet to hand out to new dog owners or young adults. It is simple and straight forward but doesn't go into much detail. If its detail that you want try one of the authors books, The Other End Of The Leash was a great book."
4,Leader of the pack,"Having 4 dogs myself I know how easy it can be to give your dog what he wants because it's easier. But as a certified dog trainer myself I agree with Patricia that dogs should not walk all over us. They can get what they want by being ""good"" dogs which means patience and boundaries.This booklet can be read very quickly and applied immediately to your training routine with your dog. This is a fun booklet with things to do for both you and your dog."
5,Dogs really are a different species,This book is a great one to read in order to try to understand the reasons WHY dogs are having their issues. Watching the dogs behavior after reading this book makes their behavior make much more sense.I have recommended it to several of my friends who have aggressive dogs.
2,Kind of disappointed,"Was hoping this book would be a ""dog whisperer"" type and give all kinds of great tips. It failed to deliver, but I gave it to a friend."
1,I wasted my money,That was a pamplet not a book. It might help a beginner a little but not worth the price.
1,Buyer Beware,"Fool me once, shame on me........ I bought this without having read the description. This is not a book, it is a PAMPHLET, just 16 pages long!!! I haven't read it yet, I am still in the shock stages of what I got in the mail, it was almost a joke to open this package. But it will probably take me 20 minutes to read this silly thing. But, I must again admit that the description doesn't hide how short it is."
4,Not like the original,"The idea of listening a new recording of John Barry's memorable Out of Africa is to say the least interesting. So, I prefered to listen to the new recording without listening the original one before. Just to see the difference. Well, even from the first track you can see the difference and you miss instatly the original recording. It is not a bad album. Not at all, but it lacks the smoothness and the feeling of the original album. The sound seems more ""metalic"" and lacks the passion of the original. Still it's a way to appreciate once more the fantastic work of John Barry."
2,Agree. Not as good as the original.,"Every soundtrack sounds like the previous one because of slow, ponderous, heavy, sterile, dry interpretation of the themes. One just expects some brightness in the playing but this is never delivered. This recording ""tries"" to have a story. Stick to the original soundtrack. 1000 times more enjoyable."
3,Not what I hoped for,I was looking for a map puzzle that would teach the borders and names of countries. This map did not do it for me.
3,too hard to read,"This is a terrific concept, unfortunately it is too small to read any of the printing or to find the pieces. They need to include an enlarged copy of the picture so someone can actually read the information! It's ashame, because it has great potential."
5,Fun and education put togheter,"My grandson loves maps and jigsaw puzzles. So, while he plays with a toy he likes, he learns geography."
1,Misleading Product Title and Description,I wanted to get a world map puzzle with maybe less than 60 pieces for a 3-year-old kid. I got this world map puzzle with 600 pieces. I am disappointed. I wish this product was listed with accurate description. There is no way that I could have guessed from the title of the product. This is not a toy at all. I'll have to donate it when I get a chance. Please ignore my ratings because I didn't even open the box. It wouldn't let me enter a comment without rating it.
4,Jet Set,"Picked up this album on a whim. The variation of music is its greatest attraction. I put this CD in every Friday after work when I make my first martini for the weekend. I'm not a music expert but, it relaxes and prepares you to go hang at your favorite watering hole."
2,disappointing,"I found this book to be tedious and repetitive. In my opinion, this is very unlike any other story I've read by J. Kellerman. The first three quarters of the story the author seemed to be ""filling the pages."" I own every Delaware story by the author and I still anticipate the next."
3,Passable but disappointing,"Kellermans books have gradually declined and Monster is no exception. As serial killer books go its not very interesting. Too much formula, the characters are plug ins and the ending is very predictable."
5,Great Book,Kellerman again surprises and astounds us with a new Alex Delaware novel. As good as it gets!
3,Great Delaware but did JK timewarp?,Once again JK has delivered vintage Delaware. The plot was intriguing and the characters well defined. I was convinced though that this was an old manuscript dusted off and reworked for a current release. There were numerous references that felt like they were written in the mid 80's. In spite of that minor distraction I found myself reading late into the night.
2,Slow Going,"This was a good idea for a story, but the telling of it was stale and wooden. Kellerman's usual spark was missing in this one."
3,"Interesting, good plot twist but a little dry....","I liked this book that I picked up while at the airport. It kept me interested and that's hard to do albeit it had it's very very dry moments. I didn't care for the detached manner in which the author addressed the love relationship between Alex and Robin. Geez... he described love making the same way he described mailing a letter. It was obvious he just wasn't into it but felt, for some reason, it should be included.But I thoroughly enjoyed the twists and turns the story took. I especially liked the fact that while the story took these strange turns the author didn't hide information to pull out at the last minute. That's important. You learn everything at the same time Milo and Alex learn it and you can all draw your own conclusions.So if you want a good page turner this is one."
1,Monster,"Jonathan Kellerman used to be one of my very favorite authors. There was a time when i couldn't wait for his newest novel to be released. Actually, I have quite a collection of his books in my library. But, unfortunately i believe Mr Kellerman is slipping. The last two novels of his which i have read (Monster being the most recent) were not up to his usual standard. My biggest complaint was that I did not care enough about the characters to wonder what was going to happen in the end. I also was dissappointed that Milo and Robin were barely mentioned. I enjoy reading about them almost as much as I do Alex Delaware. I sincerely hope that his next book reminds me of why I used to be one of his biggest fans."
3,I was expecting much much more!,"I started this book with much enthusiasm based on the reviews that I had read about this novel. It took me about 2 weeks to get through it because it just didn't keep me wanting to get back to figure it out.First let me say that the premise of the story is a good one. (Psychotics in mental institutions is usually a great storyline). However, I went in thinking that this was going to be hair raising and get my heart pumping. I was disappointed.There wasn't enough depth to the characters and it almost seemed like the author was getting bored and needed to ""wrap things up"". Bottom line: Just wasn't scary ENOUGH."
3,Not one of Kellerman's best,"I was excited about beginning a new Alex Delaware novel and was, on the whole, disappointed with this effort. Monster is definitely not one of Jonathan Kellerman's best. The plot is implausible, to say the least. It was very easy to figure out whodunit early on in the book. It seemed as if the Alex and his policeman friend, Milo, were either working with closed minds or with blinders on. I hope the next Delaware novel is back up to snuff."
2,Kellerman Slips,"The book is predictable and boring at times, but keeps your attention by throwing in some gore and horror. Like a car wreck, you know you shouldn't keep looking but for some reason you do. How DOES Alex Delaware keep that great house in the California hills without doing any full time work? And I'm sick to death of the one-dimensional relationship with live-in Robin -- they are two people who have no more meaningful conversations than their soppy psuedo-intellectual exchanges of about three sentences that precede their lovemaking, which takes place every time they run into one another. Give me a break. Kellerman could write a great book by delving into the characters as they solve a believable case, rather than trying to conjure up a horrifying yet ""stretch"" of a situation that permits only paper-doll characters."
2,Convoluted & tedious,"Reading this book makes me realize how much I prefer J. Kellerman's wife Faye's straight forward direct style of writing. This book, Monster, dragged on & on. It became so convoluted that it was hard to figure out its direction. I liked Billy Straight but this was no where near as well written. Dr. Argent was a difficult character to sympathize with. Her parents breezed in and out of the book too quickly. I did not care for Peake and was amazed that the killer had such an easy time getting in and out of Starkeweather and in & out of trouble. This book was very tedious and unrealistic."
2,A Bit Disappointing,"I usually quite like the Alex Delaware novels, however, I did find this one to be not only predictable, but farfetched. This book finds Alex and Milo investigating the death of a young psychologist who worked at a hospital for the criminally insane. Early on Alex begins tossing out theories that seem to be reaching at best and has you guessing at who the ""players"" might be, and who are, in fact, painfully obvious. This is definately up to the Kellerman's usual standards."
3,Predictions,"A madman institutionalized in a secured hospital for the criminally insane is predicting the most gruesome murders. The horror of it is that these heinous murders are taking place. Alex Delaware is called to find out how this man can predict these crimes. Milo Sturgis and Alex work against time to stop the monstrous slayings. Beware this is a book that will keep you up at night. Read at your own risk. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
4,"Intriguing storyline, definitely worth a read","I adore this sort of plot! Maniac, mad, dumb killer inside a mental institution somehow is able to eerily predict details of a series of brutal murders which take place out on the street. How does it all tie together? How does this guy know this stuff? I defy you as the reader not to be intrigued from page one!Whilst it is kind of annoying how Alex manages to involve himself in every detail (he is not a cop, after all), nevertheless this is a great story and will keep you entertained. A perfect holiday read."
3,A good read anyway,"This is an enjoyable book although I agree with other reviewers, not of the calibre of previous Kellerman books. The last couple I have really not enjoyed, with 'The web"" being a lowpoint in my mind. But of your looking for an entertaining read that has an interesting plot, you'll enjoy this one."
4,A well thought out plot.,"A rather dark story with characters that are not especially appealing,yet the different feelings you get following this cleverly written venture into the minds of the criminally insane and the functional psychopath,has to make one wonder about the cost of being a product of a dysfunctional family, not only to the individual, but all the people he may adversely affectduring the course of is life.I had no problem with Kellerman choosing this type of book,as I've read Vachss' works which are much darker bycontrast and subject matter,and have some really off-beat characters."
2,Kellerman is great unlike this book.....,I love Jonathan Kellerman! I have read all of his books and the only one I disliked was Butchers Theatre....til now. Monster wasn't a bad book it just wasn't typical Kellerman fare. If this was your first J. Kellerman book...don't give up now. Go back and read the earlier stuff and I'll eagerly await the next one.
3,Typical kellerman but still kinda fun,"Once again, Dr. Alex Delaware, the white knight shrink rushes to the rescue. With his trusty cop sidekick,Milo(remember tho, the rule of sidekicks? Spock was cooler than Capt. Kirk and Ilya was cooler than Napoleon Solo? Well it works here too, Milo is much more intriguing a character than the blue eyed wishy washy Alex). The two of them are investigating a grisly murders with years old tie-ins. Who did it? The thorazined wreck in the William Castle-esque nut house? His cruel attendants? Or someone from the not so distant past? Your guess is as good as mine, and Kellerman weaves his usual conspiracy laden story. Robin the cutesy girl friend is there as well as Spike the even cuter dog. Nice fast read. thumbs up"
2,Not one of his best,I'm happy to hear it wasn't just me that thought Monster was not one of Kellerman's better efforts. I am an avid fan of this series and this book left me wondering what happened. I had trouble keeping interested in this plot and that has never happened before. It had very little of the usual drama and twists and turns of an Alex Delaware/Milo Sturgis investigation. I hope his next effort is better. I would hate to think that this series has come to an end.
1,This Is The Last Kellerman Book I'll Read,"I've read all of the Jonathan Kellerman books and some of his earlier books were well worth reading. This one, however, is sterile. Kellerman only goes through the motions of writing without developing his on-going characters and with scenes and situations that are unpleasant. I do not want to plod through an institution for the insane, endure the disgusting descriptions of the inmates, and read about gory murders without having some reward... either in the writing, the characters, a visit to somewhere pleasant - SOMETHING! This book is an unrelieved nightmare and any possible reader is advised that he/she will only put garbage into the mind without any reward or insight when the book is finished. I wish I'd never heard of it and I will read no more Jonathan Kellerman books. He has not developed and moved forward, nor have his books."
3,Not as Good as Previous Works,"Monster has a decent plot, but what I look forward to most in Alex Delaware novels is the character, himself. Kellerman spent very little time on Alex, and, in fact, he was almost incidental to the story. I found it really hard to get through this one."
2,Not up to his usual standard,"I was quite dissapointed in 'Monster'.Mr. Kellerman had done a real quality job in building the characters of Alex Delaware, Milo et al over the past number of books - this book adds zero to this.The book seems to have been rushed through - try his previous books - now, they are stellar !"
3,"Johanthan Kellerman ""Monster""","price and shipping great deal. Book is kind of old, yellow pages, no book jacket, but the price and shipping was very quick. Over all pleased with this purchase. thank you"
3,Just relax and read,"The story of the book is a good one, but the book is not an easy reading book, the way that the movie maker takes out of jail a prisoner to do his last job is a little bit out of reality if you see that is a maximum security prison combined with a psychological prison, it is not the best book, but you can read it in a flight or at the pool while resting."
3,Not Kellerman's best effort,"I am a huge fan of Jonathan Kellerman and have read practically all of his books. However, this one, while okay, was not up to his usual standard. It starts out a bit slow, for one thing...always a negative in a mystery novel. And while we did have the comfortable usual ""cast of characters"" of the Alex Delaware series, I guess that I'd like to see some new aspects of these characters. Finally, I'd like to see some more ""realistic"" portrayals of the criminals in the series - reinforcing the public's mind that ""all people in prison are instrinsically evil sociopaths"" is not really serving the public good. I'm still a fan of Alex Delaware and Jonathan Kellerman...but hopefully his next effort will have a new spark."
2,CHEATED!,"I was eagerly anticipaing J.K. latest release only to be disappointed by a far fetched plot that did nothing to keep my attention. As a faithful fan, I vow to finish the last 35 pages (if I can manage to keep awake!). I will,however, give him another chance as I have up to now always enjoyed his books. I will just have to believe he was just having a ""bad book day""."
1,Please. Who's kidding who?,"Dr Kellerman is a Ph D psychologist, his wife another author with doctorate in dental sciences live in beverly hills and have a fat contract to come up with much of the same of the same of the same. I think it stinks that all your reviewers live in fear of their careers of praising the praised to make books that are essentially boring stock the shelves of every grocery, pharmacy and convenience store in the USA.Go back to practicing psychology for inspiration Mister Doctor Kellerman. When will reality not have a price in the four major publishing houses of the world."
2,Too much gore - not enough excitement!,"Bring back Petra! Billy Straight was a much better book. Alex Delaware needs a rest. This novel, Monster, describes a psychopathic killer and his horrific murders. It does give an interesting insight into the mind of crazies, but I would prefer more description of the characters, and relationships among them, rather than the detailed, gruesome descriptions of the disgusting doings of the Monster.If you are looking for a great mystery, a page-turner filled with excitement, I recommend Michael Connelly's Void Moon. Happy Reading!"
3,Too monstrous,"Having read and loved all the Jonathan Kellerman/Alex Delaware novels, I rate Monster several stars beneath his other offerings. Too violent, characters too crazy to be believable (I hope). Story line a little too far out. Finishing the last 6 or 7 chapters was a chore."
2,Monstrous disappointment (unabridged audio version),Loved Billy Straight and all JK's books except for Monster. I felt cheated about half way through but clenched my teeth and got through it. I have noticed that online reviews of this book are either very good or very bad. What's up with that? Sorry to give a negative review and intend to give JK another chance.
2,So-so book,"As for the plot and attractiveness of the book, I agree with the review that suggested Kellerman was mainly ""filling the pages.""In particular, if an author is going to set a book in California, the author should be familiar with California. It is illegal for an employer to ask an employee's marital status, yet the hospital requires its employees to update resumes which include a ""marital-status blank.""One of the victims dies survived by two parents, but without a will. Kellerman incorrectly states, ""With no will, the state takes most of it and [her] parents get the rest.""One gets the impression that editors either don't care to, or don't dare to, point out the mistakes of well-known authors."
3,"Monster is a good, dark read!","I enjoy Jonathan Kellerman's writings. He leads you step by step through his thrillers like finding bits of treasure clues through a very dark forest. I really like the relationship between Alex Delaware & Milo Sturgis. Kellerman gives them each the freedom to be their own person; they're allowed to think & be. Meanwhile all around them hell is breaking loose in the form of an insane inmate who seems to be predicting murders! For my full review please see [my website] killed off? Maybe because he talked too much to the investigators. Kellerman describes Ardis Peak, Milo, Dr. Delaware, and Derrick Crimmins fairly well but many of the other people he fails to add anything very gripping, Therefore, when you are introduced to a new suspect, it is really a fifty fifty shot if they are part of the rampant murders. The ending is fairly interesting but many of the connections could have been established with greater clarity."
3,A Good Start,"All in all a good book that i would suggest, without guilt, for a lazy Sunday afternoon read. Monster is well written and has plot and story idea worth the time. It is a fun book. However, the final 1/4 of the book is weak. One feels as if Jonathan was in a hurry to finish it off. The ending seems rushed and is not well explained or supported."
2,Disappointed Fan,"As a loyal J.K. fan, I was disappointed with Monster's slow pace and predictable ending. I was hoping it would be a gripping page-turner like Billy Straight. Although well-written, the main character was unsympathetic and most of the story took place in the same setting - a dreary mental institution. However, I haven't given up on Alex Delaware - better luck next time!"
1,Disappointment,"I have read most of Kellerman's books and enjoyed them. This book is non-stop gore. Do you enjoy children being slashed to death? Do you enjoy young women having their eyes gouged out? I can't believe he wrote it, it is so unlike any of his other books. I hope he never writes a book like it again."
2,A slow-moving Delaware novel,"I've read most of the Alex Delaware novels, but it's been awhile since I've done it. Unfortuneately, I was disappointed by Monster. I generally like Milo's and Alex's adventures, but this one just didn't seem to get its foot until halfway through the book. I felt confident Kellerman would tie all the loose ends and story threads together by the end of the book, but it took too long for things to start to come together and then it all came in a rush that seemed to require some fairly big logic jumps.The story also did nothing to advance the characters. So you could safely skip the Delaware novel and not miss anything in an otherwise great series."
4,Entertaining,It wasn't too deep. It was an easy read. If you're looking for literature - keep looking. If you're looking for a vacation book to read near the pool - this is a good choice.
2,Not his best,"Jonathan Kellerman is one of my favorite authors, so his latest book was much anticipated. I began reading it, but it was hard to follow and vague in places. The plot was just so-so, and the characters were flat. I hope his next outing is back to his former crackling standards."
1,Plodding and unimaginative,"Not a good read. Have not read any other Kellerman but was not bothered by the absence of character development others have complained of. I could not stand, however, his decision to focus on the detail of certain events. One example, why dedicate so many plodding pages to a conversation with security guards at the end which contributed absolutely nothing to the resolution? There are other instances. Thankfully I picked this one up on the bargain table."
2,Very Disappointing!,Not like the usual flare of the other delaware novels....no relationship between alex and robin or between milo and alex. It starts out bizarre and never picks up. Cannot figure out the relationships between the victms to the killer not even till the end. I hope other novels will not follow.
2,Disappointing for Kellerman,"I have read all of Mr. Kellerman's books. This one, along with ""Billy Straight"" were two of his poorest. I love the Alex Delaware character throughout his earlier works. This book however was predictable, tedious and lacked substance and the usual Kellerman twists and intelligence. Don't judge this author by this book-his earlier Delaware novels are extraordinary. Mr. Delaware should stick to what he knows-child psychology vs. sociopathy."
2,"LIFELESS SAGA STARRING THE MONSTER, ALEX, AND MILO","I am beginning to think that Jonathan Kellerman should retire Dr. Alex and Milo except in cameo appearances (BILLY STRAIGHT). His main characters are lifeless anymore, and to be honest, by the end of the book, I only wanted to be done with it and couldn't have cared who was doing what to whom. I have read everyone of his fiction books, and more and more I think his stories involving Dr. Alex are boring. The characters do not come to life. I know Jonathan Kellerman is an excellent writer but I'm beginning to think his best books were THE BUTCHER'S THEATER AND BILLY STRAIGHT, non Dr. Alex Delaware sagas."
2,Monster does NOT make this first time Kellerman reader a fan,"I had not read any of Kellerman's books before and I was disappointed. Normally, a great book has you read more and more of it each day. It seemed that by the time I got to what should have been the climatic moment(where the ""monster"" is on the loose), I was reading less and less where even the conclusion seemed slow paced. Sometimes, the tediousness of investigating a case adds to the suspense. In this case, it seemed as though the book was fluffed up just to justify the retail price. I'm sure Kellerman is a great author who is prone to the ""hit or miss"" syndrome as others are. Monster, to me, is one of his misses."
1,Disappointed....,"Every year I look forward to reading the new Jonathan Kellerman book. This year's book was a disappointment. The characters of Alex and Milo seemed flat... Usually, I pick up a Kellerman book and I can't put it down...I had no problem putting this book down. My sister borrowed the book and was glad she hadn't purchased it... Maybe Kellerman is bored with the characters of Alex and Milo...Billy Straight was a much better book..."
2,Painfully laborious!,"Picked up the audio version and struggled through it. Apart from the unimaginative redition, I found the content itself to be less than riveting - considerably so. Give me Sanford any day. In fact, I might even go so far as to say that Alex Comort is more interesting than Delaware. And that's saying something."
4,If you like some gore of Psychology...,"First off, I really like the main character of this book. This was the first Kellerman book I have ever read but after doing so, I would read another one with Dr. Delaware. He's a smart character and I am totally enthralled with psychological thrillers. This was a good one. I have read better, I must say, but Mr. Kellerman did a great job keeping me interested and coming up with my own theories. I have to agree, though, that Milo being a top detective, was not very...I dunno what the word is...quick thinking. As far as theories and stuff go. But, it is just a book, I must remember, and I will read another one of this series eventually. So, for a thought provoking book with many psychologically damaged characters and a smart doctor, read this book. I doubt you'll be too dissappointed."
2,Not his best,This is not the best Kellerman book I have read. It is slow to get into and Milo and Alex are not as compelling in this novel.
4,First and hooked,I have recently read monster and loved it. It is the first book I have read by JK and am hooked. I have already gone out and bought other books in the series. I like the twist and turns in this book even though I kinda had an idea of how it would play out and loved the erie ending. Cant wait to read another in the series.
3,So so.,This book is not well written and could be used for the Youth Group I am leading. I have to pick another one.
5,I Can Breathe!!!,This is a great product for anyone with sinus infections and anyone who has a cold or flu. The vapor covers a fair size room and will let you get the benefit of a soothing vapor while you sleep. It will definitely help you breathe more comfortably and this product in very inexpensive!!!
4,Very good,"Here is a prime example where the music was better than the movie. Alan Silvestri has done a great job depicting the beauty and terror of the volcano in his theme, ""March of the Lava."" You can almost imagine a river of lava flowing through your own backyard! Track 2, ""Miracle Mile"" is full of suspense and sheer fright, worthy of any Aliens movie. Track 5, ""Build a Wall"", shows the heroism of the firefighters and the bonding of the people as they work together to put out the ever raging flames. Track 8, ""Cleansing Rain"", depicts the relief of the people as the volcano has been stopped and they can finally rest to look around at what has been done. The soundtrack basically WAS the movie and I highly recommend it to you."
5,"Touching, tender, loving and insightful","James Spada has created a loving tribute to the most famous brother and sister in America, John and Caroline Kennedy. Using a range of rarely seen photographs to tell the stories of their two remarkable lives, Spada weaves an emotionally vivid account of the lives of the Camelot Kids. A tasteful, and tasty, tribute to the children of JFK and Jackie.A MUST HAVE for any Kennedy fan."
4,jfk's children and their life in photo's,"good to see how jackie kennedy was able to shield them until they could think for themselves . some very good photo's showing how close the three were , such a pity john's crash . so now i can see why caroline wrote her book ,""The right to privacy"" ."
5,"Loved this book ""on first sight""","I am sitting here typing with a copy of this book from our local library. When I saw the cover, I thought ""I think maybe I want to purchase a copy for my own home library."" I have only just begun to read the rest, however I strongly desire to acquire this!"
1,"JACKIE, JOHN AND CAROLINE: OH NO!","If a picture is worth 1,000 words, then James Spada's pictorial biography should be priceless when it comes to praise. Alas, it is nothing more than an excuse to throw together about 250 photos (some of which, if you believe the book's hype, have ""never been published"") that exploit, more than honor, the Kennedy siblings. See Caroline romp around the Oval Office. (Yet again.) See John-John salute dead Daddy. (Yet again). See them grow older and harass photographers. (Yet again.) See them with Mommy and friends and lovers and cousins and aunts. See them on- and off-Cape, in and out of the water, on and off the stage. See John and his ""other"" Carolyn---wife Carolyn Bessette--fight on the streets of Manhattan. See how quickly we close the book"
1,WARNING: NOT WIDESCREEN,"Bought this yesterday... the dvd is advertised on the back cover as being 1:85 Widescreen. However, it is as actually fullscreen. Rating is for the DVD - not the movie itself."
4,Great movie for a laugh,"Sometimes you just want to watch a movie and laugh, this is perfect. Like Animal House on the slopes."
5,Facing Vital Challenges Through an Entertaining Journey,"The many facets of this documentary weave together a coherent and powerful sense of vital information affecting the present and the future. Whether or not you are deeply involved with studying economic theory, public policy, history, or the future, many key features of these things permeate your life, and this DVD can entertainingly provide a mixture of insights, illustrations, and warnings to consider. Facts play a much larger role than speculation in this documentary, though the speculations seem plausible and add to the value of the overall effect. Scholars may find it productive to ask themselves how much they agree or disagree with the speculations and why... then in future decades revisit the video to compare these details with how things actually unfolded. This DVD's use of moving images that metaphorically relate to narration is often profoundly engaging, too."
2,A book to go along with the movie,"Stephen Zarlengas book, ""The Lost Science Of Money"" might go along with this movie fairly well: [...]"
3,A good time killer,"This book is very good for picking up when you don't have much to do. The facts in the book are interesting, but hard to find. There is no way to find a specific oddball or eccentric. The people are broken up into catergories, but from there you're on your own. Enjoy."
2,Muddled Soul,"I think that Robert Stone has written some great books, but this is not one of them. Bay of Souls seems torn between an Dellilo style life in the USA novel, and the usual Stone third world Conradesque action/philosophy thriller. Sad to say, but the academic parts, the creeping ennuie, the sudden adultery, minutia of modern life, etc. seem much more real than the drug crazed revolutionary danger parts, which is too bad because there are a lot of people who do the Delillo/Carver thing and not a lot who can pull off the headlong rush of Robert Stone."
2,Not nearly up to Stone's standard,"Robert Stone has long been one of my favorite writers, but this book is terribly disappointing. The characters are flat, cliched and uninteresting. They are merely reruns of previous characters in earlier and finer novels. The action is predictable and mundane. If an unknown writer would have submitted this to a publisher they would have gotten a devestating rejection note, I'm afraid. I'm going to reread ""A Flag For Sunrise"", to remind me of how good Robert Stone can write."
1,A horrid reading experience,"After a fine opening, another look at adultery in academia, the plot goes crazy with a soul trapped in an emerald and a revolution on an island. Totally unbelievable. Silly dialogue. Where was the editor? Definitely this is one of the worst books I've ever read by an acclaimed author."
2,he's done much better.,"As a rabid fan of this author since ""Hall of Mirrors"", I was sadly let down by this book. It seemed pretentious, not a flaw I normally associate with Mr.Stone, although there are some passages of lovely writing. The initial premise seems fascinating but the whole simply does not jell. Go back to his earlier work for rewarding re-reading!"
1,An Adequate First Draft,"I was surprised to learn, after reading Bay of Souls, that this was Robert Stone's first in five years, because it seemed hastily thrown-together. I thought the story of Kirsten and Michael Ahearn and their son was wonderful and then more or less dropped. According to his blurb at the back, Stone had some interactions with Madison Smart Bell. I wish he'd written about Haiti, instead, essays, and finished the tale he started, which was like Updike with a little more edge. Maybe I'm just not a voodoo guy, but I was sorely disappointed with the promise of the beginning of this book set against its patched-together ending."
1,Washed Up,"Stone works best on a grand scheme where his grandiose themes have time to build and then draw the reader in. Here the characters seem flat and the prose is ordinary compared to his former lyrical masterpieces like ""Hall of Mirrors"" and ""Dog SOldiers."" It is always a bad sign when writers start writing novels about writers and teachers. It means they are running out of ideas. And while Stone is a contemporary master, his last three novels ""Outerbridge Reach,"" ""Damascus Gate"" and ""Bay of Souls"" go from average to below average to downright bad. Time it seems has had a deleterious effect on Stone's storytelling ability, as he is forced to rehash age old revolutionary themes that seemed so ripe with pertinence back in the 60s and 70's. Still, I have no doubt that Stone can pull out an ""Old Man in the Sea"" like Poppa Hemingway did late in his career. For a short gem of a novel exploring loss and rediscovery see Denis Johnson's ""Name of the World."""
3,That Voodoo You Do,"Robert Stone explores familiar terrain in this story of a man who gets into the ring with his own myths of masculinity, marital betrayal, and family discord. Stone adds strong drams of voodoo and dark spirits into this volatile, seductive concoction, which promotes a nightmarish carnival ending reminiscent of his first novel, A Hall of Mirrors. While a treat for his fans, this book doesn't reach the artistic peaks set out in Outerbridge Reach or the emotional depths of A Flag for Sunrise."
2,An Unworthy Tale,"Robert Stone, one of my favorite authors, has written a novel which is clearly unworthy of his great talents. The book has a thrown-together quality, as one improbable incident follows another. I will not reiterate the plot, as so many other reviewers have done this so sucessfully. But I have to agree with the consensus: the characters are not fully developed, and their motivation is unclear. It almost seems like Mr. Stone just decided that he wanted to write a book that was exciting, frightening, and sexy. Start with a sensitive family drama, then add a little in-the-know power politics, a near death experience while searching undersea for lost emeralds, some terrifying Colombian drug dealers, and end with wild voodoo ceremonies and the wreckage of his home life. What have you got? That's the question."
1,bay of bores,i found this book to be lacking in characterization as well as plot. it started out fine and just wound up so silly. i wonder if the author really knew what he wanted to do here. the lara love interest seemed like she was on an acid trip. the guy just ups and goes leaving everything behind for flimsy reasons. it's as though he was looking for an excuse to play around. perhaps this book would've been better if it were longer and better thought out.
4,"Practical, effective application of the Social Styles model",The authors have reworked and improved upon the social stylesmodel of David Merril (but haven't given him any credit that I could find). The book is easy to read and the strategies are practical and effective. Anyone who wants to work more effectively with others and get more enjoyment out of their relationships would benefit from reading this book.
5,Book Rating,"The book was exactly what I was expecting. Service was fantastic, pricing best ever. Now just implement what I have read so far, it will be great."
5,Powerful common-sense principles for building relationships,"The Platinum Rule provides powerful common-sense principles for building relationships. It is must reading for anyone who depends on others (and who doesn't?). George Morrisey, author, ""Morrisey on Planning"""
3,"If you like this, you'll also like...",Nowell Sing We Clear with John Roberts & Tony Barrand. There are several versions of their Christmas albums available at GoldenHindMusic dot com. Quite lovely acapella and musically accompanied male singers. Will transport you back in time.
5,Short But Consise Book on Doctrine of God,"If you are looking for a short, consise, but sound doctrinal book on the doctrine of God then I would encourage you to pick up a copy of Dr. John MacArthur's book. Each chapter of the book deals with an attribute of our awesome God. And in keeping with his tradition, Dr. MacArthur gives us pleanty of Scriptures to chew on as we look at our God.My only complaint is a good one in that I wish that this book were longer!"
3,Ok sound,"You get what you pay for that's for sure. This is a lower quality sounding drum, better decoration or beginners drum."
3,"Uneven, but some real gems","I find it hard to be too critical of any concert put on for charity, as this one was. However, there are several uneven performances on this collection, as well as a few flat-out bad ones. These, luckily, are balanced by some great performances and some clever interpretations of Sondheim standards. I especially enjoyed David, Shaun, and Patrick Cassidy singing ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy"", the cast of Forever Plaid singing ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"", ""Barcelona"", and Tim Curry's interpretation of ""Losing My Mind."" This is not a collection for the Sondheim purist, nor is it a good introduction for someone who knows little about Sondheim's work. But if you're willing to wade through a few questionable performances to get to the good stuff, you'll enjoy it."
2,Only if you absolutely must...,"This album has been derogatorily referred to as the ""Send in the singers"" album by Sondheim afficianados, and not without reason: The interpretations of ""Someone in a Tree"" and ""Invocation"" are off-key, off-tempo, and off-full. There are some redeeming features (A hysterical parody of ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" by the Forever Plaid cast; Glynis Johns's proof of her ownership of ""Send in the Clowns""; and the Cassidy brother's ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy"" are probably the major ones for me), but this is by far and away the most mediocre of the Sondheim compilations out there. If you must have every thing ever done, then get this album; otherwise, get the considerably better Carnegie Hall celebration."
2,Ok...if you're a 6th grader,"I purchased this script with the intent of directing it as a high school play. Our high school has done many productions of children's stories and almost always receives a positive response, so I was not worried about the content of the play being too infantile. But this play was adapted from the original book to be performed by a group of 6th graders. The age group it was intended for shows blatantly. After reading through it and reflecting on the play as a whole, I decided that it was pretty lame. Now, I'm not trying to impugn Mr. George's adaptation. On the contrary, I commend him for taking the initiative to put so much work into adapting a story like this for the stage. But I wouldn't dare try to put this play on the stage of a high school theatre, or anything at all, unless it is done with all children cast members or done for an all children audience."
5,Charlie and the chocolate factory,"I found this book a most stimulating read, a truly exostentuous experience for any young man or eligeable young person to spend their Sunday afternooon perusing.I will highly recomend this book, the characters were most tangeable and the diction frippent, I think perhaps it contains some useful message on morality to all the little cherubs."
2,Looks great poor functionality,"I love the look but I am unable to twist or take of the lids. Grant it my wrist is a bit sore (more sore now) however, I had my plumber try to take a lid off. He struggled and finally the herb went flying all over the kitchen. Forget about twisting the lids to shake or pour out of the slot. I tried putting olive oil on the rim just to see if lubrication would work. Any suggestions - has anyone else had this problem - perhaps I got a bad batch? Thanks,"
2,OH NO NOT SOHO!,If you looking for a product solution that is easy to use skip this spice set.I purchased a 12 canister SOHO Spice set 6yrs ago - other than the top of the of canister containing the turmeric spice ( it's now cloudy) the rack has been GREAT.I recently purchased the SOHO 20 canister set and it is very much a cheap replica of what I previously bought. I went to considerable trouble and freight expense to purchase this set (as I'm in Australia).Canister set does not stick securely to backing board - because magnets are inferior (not as thick as previous model)Canister is difficult to open/close - these canisters are not what SOHO was originally making. I have the old and new side by side and the seal is different.I took the time to write to SOHO before purchase and after purchase with no response. Clearly the company has no interest in customer service.Would help future buyers to know how many canisters the board fits which is 28.
2,Great Idea Looks Awesome... Bad Quality,Makes a mess. If you plan on putting the spice cans on any colored metal appliances in the kitchen. ((Bad idea) the magnets are made of the soft cheap stuff. So it leaves behind dark rings of muck. So best to just use the steel panel that it comes with if your appliances are any color other than black. Also the magnets are not very strong so if you bump one get ready for a domino show one will knock of two. Two will get three till everything below the one you're messing with is on the floor. (((If you wish it to be completely vertical. This all changes if you're going with a slop or horizontal set up. But the whole point of the product for me was to put it vertical to save space.Canisters are pretty cheaply made as well they do not screw on like you would think. They pop on. Not conducive to a long lasting design.All in all GREAT!!! Idea... But cheap production killed it..
5,Love it love it love it,Things like this spice rack are the reason I shop online! You can't get anything like this where I am and certainly nothing at such a reasonable price.
1,Awful product... spices falling everywhere,"I was so excited to get these for our new home with my new chef hubby.... how disappointing it was. The metal sheet is the only good thing about it. The containers don't seal at all; in fact spices just get stuck in the space between the side rubber of the canister and lid, then when you put them on the magnetic metal spice dust like paprika goes every where. The magnets are not very strong and when you go to grab one on the top, don't touch the others at all because, all the others come cascading down with it. Great in concept but still needs lots of tweaking!"
2,"bottoms r not flat, magnets slide down the board","some of the bottoms are not flat, thus they don't stick flat on the board. they wobble and slide down."
2,poor magnet,"This system looks great, but the tins are constantly falling off of the board. This drives me absolutely nuts! I may have to look into replacing the magnets on all the tins, but it will end up costing a lot of money."
4,expensive but very nice,Very expensive but the best on the market you could find. Well made and look great on my kitchen wall. Never thought I needed all the jars but now thinking of buying more as I still have room on the board. Do not put cloves in these as they eat away the plastic see through window in the lid. All the different spice colours add to this looking very colourful and stylish. Love it and definitely would recommend.
4,Seems to work fine for me,"Alton Brown recommended this approach to spice storage on Good Eats and it seems like a good system.I just got it set up, but it seems to be working fine for me so far."
2,Discovering Poetry,There is a lot of writing in the book. Some is helpful but a lot is just opinion that gets in the way.
3,what is the track list?,i was thinking of buying the CD online but i cant find a list of the tracks anywhere?
5,well worth reading,"An exciting account of the multi-lingual medieval cultural stew that gave rise to great lyric poetry. The book is rather repetitive and does not deal much with the poetry itself, but it contains powerful critiques of the nationalist and orthodox tendencies of philology and renaissance studies and a very suggestive linking of medieval lyric poetry to modern rock music."
5,john tradescant the gardener,Tale of John Tradescant the gardener is featured in historical novel ''Earthly Joys'' by Philippa Gregory; Sequel ''Virgin Earth'' continues the saga with his son also named John Tradescant whose journeys include the New World.
3,too tight,"The shoe looks great and is flashy. But it is too narrow on the sides which makes it difficult to do lateral movement.Also, the cushioning is weak and not very soft."
5,Internal Medicine,"Great book for medicine. This book helps you to apply medicine. It takes you through cases and not only questions you on what the diag. is, approiate treatment / test / medication regimen etc. but explains why the answer is what it is."
1,supercherie,"les morceaux de musique ne sont pas joués par les artistes originaux, mais par un orchestre de Nashville.Je suis trés déu."
5,ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS,"Wow! This is the rare jazz record of late that I cannot get out of my CD player. Passion, simplicity, and an absolute command of space and silence echo throughout. As an earlier fan noted, the version of ""Blame It On My Youth"" is another definitive reading of this piece by Jarrett, who turns it into absolute poetry.This is the perfect record for quiet, romantic times, a great record for contemplation.It's stunning."
3,Good but not great...,I would agree with the more lukewarm reviews. Of course this is a beautiful album...but there is nothing really deep here...I was looking for some new interpretations of the standards...didn't get it...also some of the phrasings are so minimal that you can barely pick them up...I think Jarrett has so rich an interior musical sense that he may forget that we cannot participate in that part..but of course I have to have Jarretts albums and no doubt he has enriched my life...but my all time favorite solo piano album is still Chick Correa Expressions. I am waiting for Jarret to do something along these lines...
2,Lounge Music,"This was a huge disappointment. The record sounds like a talented pianist playing in a hotel lounge. If you want some nice background music for a dinner party you're throwing, it's a good choice. Otherwise, look elsewhere. How could such a brilliant musician make such a banal record?"
2,Jarrett with one hand tied behind his back,"This was a big disappointment. It reminded me of his live (unrecorded) concerts where the muse of improvisation decides to take the night off, and Jarrett turns on the autopilot. It's pretty enough, but it was like watching Gary Oldman play a nice old guy."
3,Seeping sentimentalism,Still mood music paying worthy homage to some classics can often paint in fantastic depressive swipes but remains too straightforwardly pulse-less to provide consistent revisitation.
5,Century Classic,Astonishing new recording of Jarrett.Mozartian simplicity bring new meditative life to old and popular standards.Style resemble late Bill Evans but with an additional touch of sadness and without the cool algebric approach of Evans
1,Disappointed in ECM,This is the worst. Even when I did not care for Jarrett Igave him credit for taking chances and he was rarely boring. This isinsomniac's delight. Don't bother unless you like really boring music.
1,Bland...,"Jarrett was recovering from ME when he recorded these, and it shows. The standards (all ballads) are played simply and slowly, he uses conventional Bill Evans voicings, and none of his trade-mark lines. Moments of interest are very few and far between: moments of inspiration, non-existant. There's nothing to distinguish this playing from the average cocktail pianist's - that it's so popular is almost insulting to Jarrett's other work."
2,Minimalist Jarrett,"It may be Jarrett, but it's not our Keith, so be warned. A thousand other guys could have recorded this. I will be most interested to see what happens when he gets through this nervous breakdown."
1,Saccharine cocktain music,"What a disappointment! This is not even elevated cocktail music. Given this repertoire one expects, at the least, some new harmonic insights or a bit of pungency rather than the treacle which characterizes Jarrett's interpretations. Sounds like he was hit over the head with a New Age stick! I chucked the CD after a few listenings."
4,A walk on the slow side,"Beautiful standards and ballads performed with warmth and feeling,but all at such a s-l-o-w tempo as to be positively funereal.Great to unwind to,but stuck in low gear.There's little fire here.but it's a nice,easy listen."
5,In a world with so much noise...,"In a world with so much noise and clamor it is a pleasure to listen to this album. The set is so wonderfully put together and it shows the love for the ballad. K.J. has demonstrated that music does not have to be a constant flurry of notes and tempo to hit the mark. For those who complain about the sound quality of the recording I would suggest for this once, they listen with their hearts instead of their ears, with this perspective they will appreciate the music even more."
5,Wonderful night listening!,Beautiful solo piano renditions of classics. Performed so cleanly and beautifully that it is a total joy to listen to over and over. I love to play it at sunset in the dark with a glass of wine and a special guy
2,Disappointing version of KJ,"I love Keith Jarrett, but this choice of songs trivializes his talent. To have him play and sing these songs is a travesty."
2,How did this get made?,"There is a basic story hidden in the movie somewhere but it does not come to the surface easily. It is a mystic story, a magic story -- one that we want to believe in because we all want to know that there is something magical working in our lives. But ... the script stumbles all around the issue and never directly confronts it. It is a low budget film. The title character on the cover of the DVD never appears in the movie. The acting is wooden and two dimensional even though the actors are appealing. This is not entirely the fault of the actors -- the director let this be released without really knowing what he was doing. It had so much potential but that potential was not tapped. Miss this one if you can. If you are a fan of Zachary Browne or Dirk Benedict this is not their best work. It is not even good work."
4,For those disappointed with O Brother Where art Thou:,"This is a sweet and uplifting album, despite some of its dark subject matter. The third track, ""I'll Fly Away"" was in the Coen's classic film ""O Brother Where Art Thou."" For inexplicable reasons, the Kossoy Sisters' version was not included on the OBWAT soundtrack. This is the only album that has it. The musicianship is excellent, featuring both guitar and banjo. The sisters have an angelic vocal presence. It is a refreshing change from the the fashionable shallowness found in so many contemporary albums."
5,Primo old time music,"The Kosssoy Sisters as everyone else reviewing got dropped mysteriously from the soundtrack of 'O brother', maybe the upshot is that folks will get their whole album and not be content w/ I'll fly away.They were one of the the first neo-old time acts around, presumably influenced by Harry Smith's monumental Anthology of American Folk Music. So while they are not Appalaichian folks themselves, this album is surely one of the best interpreations. Their version of 'In the Pines' alone is worth the low sticker price.Perfect harmonies, great instrumentation.Thinkin bout gettin it? Do it!"
5,YES - ORDER THE TRADION 3-CD SET,"If only I'd read the review mentioning the budget-priced Traditon box set where you get ""Bowling Green"" plus two other albums, before I shelled out $50 for the single album. Not quite $19 now as listed, but still much more affordable at approx $24 for three recordings."
1,"If you want to USE the ipod, look elsewhere.","This case came with the ipod I purchased; in fact, it's one of the reasons I didn't purchase the 10G model. However, as a previous reviewer stated, you simply cannot use the ipod while it's in this case - it's only good for transporting it. There are other case options available that allow you to leave the ipod in the case and access its controls. I'm personally waiting for the Xtreme Mac case to become available. All controls can be accessed inside the case. You can charge the ipod while it is in the case (you can't with this case). It costs less and is made of leather, not nylon."
2,iPod carry case,This carry case has a plastic window which scratches the window of the iPod. I cut the plastic window out and it ok like that. Do not purchase this item if you are looking for something see through that will protect the iPod.
3,"Must be an excellent book for $1,000",Amazing that this book commands a USED price of one-thousand dollars. I realize it's out of print...but c'mon...really? WoW!!! Someone is dreaming.
3,Does an okay job,"This book was recommended as a supplement to the primary (and completely useless) text assigned for a course on statistics that I just endured. While Regression Basics is not a big book, the examples are presented well and it does a good job explaining the concepts it covers. Had this book been used as the primary text my course, I would have been much happier. In rating this book, I hesitated between giving it 3 or 4 stars: I decided that 3 stars is sufficient - while the book does do a good job of explaining some things, I still had to refer to other sources to gain a full understanding of the material."
2,A toss-off album,"Tar had two major phases: the Amphetamine Reptile phase and the Touch & Go phase. The AmRep phase was Tar at its best--loud double guitar attack, shouted non-sensical lyrics, all anchored by a huge drum sound.Unfortunately, when Tar left AmRep to go to Touch & Go, their sound became much more conventional and a lot less interesting. While some people might appreciate the move away from the ""noise"" emphasis of the AmRep material, I think Tar lost a lot of its intensity and originality.Toast almost feels like a contractural obligation album. It has a tossed-off feel and it seems like the band isn't that into it. I recommend avoiding this one."
2,so-so,"not one of best grunge groups from 90s If you,re a big fan of the cow and jesus lizard you will like this. if not you wont."
4,Great live band,This is a great band to watch live. I also like the quality of there cd. Real cuban soul.
4,Must-Have For Techno Fans,"The opening 4 songs of this CD are superior to most other Techno Music. The rest of the CD is really good, but not quite as catchy as the opening tunes which is why I only gave this album 4 stars. The fourth track on this CD, ""You Are Alive"" is one of those songs that grabs your attention the first time you hear it because the melody of both the verses and the chorus are so catchy. This CD is a refreshing break from many other Techno groups whose goal is only to make music someone can dance to without actually showing any considerable musical talent. The talent that Fragma shows in their melodies could survive easily on popular radio. As a whole, this album is almost as good as Alice Deejay's ""Who Needs Guitars Anyway?"", but songs #1, #2, and #4 are probably better than anything Alice Deejay has shown yet."
2,Repetitive,I bought this CD for one song thinking the rest would be pretty good as well. I should have bought the single. Most of the songs have the same intro and ending and sound way too much the same. I am a fan of techno/dance music and was disappointed with the rest of the CD other than the first and last track (same song).
4,"Good, but a bit commercial","This is a good album and has some very nice and pleasant trance, dance tunes but the only thing that prevents me from giving it a 5 star is that it is a bit commercial. The best tracks on the album are ""Toca Me"", ""Every Time You Need Me"", ""Everybody Knows"" and the UK No.1 ""Toca's Miracle"". It's a good dance party album but it's not trance apart from one or two tracks on the album. If you're new to this genre then it's a good beginner's guide to the world of Trance/Dance scene...Welcome!"
5,TIFFEN = reliable,I have been using Tiffen filters for more than 20 years. They are reliable and their customer service is superb!
5,Tiffen filters,Tiffen is the best. Combine the 1A with the 2A at the same time to photograph fluorescent minerals.
3,Good to try,I was lured by the price. It is definitely worth buying at that price. The rest is up to the optical taste of the photographer.
1,BAD STORY,Never Received The Item Order!!!They Just Sent Me Some Other Brand.I Would Call That VERY BAD
3,Fine but not coated...,"I was lead to believe this filter was multi-coated, probably from Amazon giving me similar results in my search. It's quite obviously not. For a casual photographer, they probably wouldn't care, but such filters will cause ghosting and reflective flares."
2,Disappointed,"I have a collection of extreme sport dvd's and like to put on when friends come over. I wont be putting this dvd on my play list. I have seen Masters of the Stone 3,4, and 5. Number 3 sucks, 4 is awesome and now 5 sucks. You got it right in #4, what happened guys? The camera they used were poor quality, the kind used in cheap ""B"" rated movies and half the sound track sucked. The jumping parts where cool and also had some great scenery, but most was boring. I suppose it is slightly better than #3. Just doesn't have the same level of quality as say mountain biking movies like New World Disorder. Just overall disappointing."
3,So-so soundtrack with a couple of gems,"Scattered among the typical soundtrack pop songs are a couple of otherwise unreleased AOR/melodic rock gems - ""O Father"" by House of Lords and a cover of ""Bad Case of Lovin' You"" by former Bad Company frontman Paul Rodgers. The House of Lords track is particularly good, and the tracks by Copperhead, Ten Inch Men, and Apostles are decent as well. The rest is pretty forgettable soundtrack rock, and was already pretty dated by 1992.Honestly, unless you're a House of Lords fan, this soundtrack isn't terrible memorable. The House of Lords track does make it a worthwhile purchase if you find it at a decent price."
2,A mildly entertaining musical black comedy,"This mildly entertaining musical black comedy about a momma's boy serial killer and the momma's boy cop who tracks him down is definitely unique in its choice of subject. Unfortunately the jewish mother and murder jokes wear thin quite quickly.Despite a top-notch cast, the music all sounds the same. Melodies and lyrics, while pleasant, are rather pedantic and simple- no complex Sondheimesque harmonies or witty word plays here."
5,Good to know these things,"While I have not spent much time studying this book, I do know it covers a myriad of subjects on self-protection. I have not yet been disappointed with any of the books written for dummies. They all tend to cover the meat and potatoes of the subject, leaving out any ego-boosting fluff."
2,Entry-level information,"This book runs 200 pages, and for the most part,consists of generally available information, commonsense (e.g. ""don't carry your social number with you"")and a lot of info from newspapers, I would guess.Next, it carries a few chapters on how to handlea scenario wherein, you are victimized by ID theft,and what to do about it, who to speak to, call, visit,etc. This might be of value to the reader, whereas,the other parts, can be obtained from general knowledge,off the internet, reading the papets, and so on.Some info might be incorrect, such as "" You have 60days to dispute a charge from when you receive themonthly invoice"". Is it 30 or 60 days ? It might dependon your country, state, or territory of residence.At over $10, I would consider the book overpriced...."
1,Steal 2 hours of your life,This movie was my first exposure to Andy Garcia and the only good thing about that was I learned I didn't want to see any more. I agreed with the Amazon reviewer completely and am stunned at the icky declarations of love for Andy and this movie that stole two hours of my life. To each his own!
4,Nicely warmed sound,"Nice depth added to sound. Made a surprising difference to how the horn sounds. I'm done, but this thing requires a min. Number of words."
4,Somebody doesn't think much of Mr. Peary....,"Some of the reviews here have been focussing on this book as a ""revisionist history"" re Peary and Arctic exploration, but that part of this book is secondary. The real focus of the book is Devlin Stead's life and discoveries about his family, whose story changes through several revelations throughout the book (maybe too many times would be one criticism of this book). Generally well-written and a good description of turn of the (20th) century New York and pre-Canada Newfoundland, recommended if you like a good historical read."
3,A story of relationships.,"There are two main themes to this book of arctic exploration. The first is the Lt Peary/ Dr Cook relationship which is based on fact and the other is the father/ son between the boy Stead and Dr Cook. From what has been previously written about Lt. Peary I found the descriptions of him and his attitude to his team very close to what they must have been in reality. However the relationship between DR Cook and his son is unconvincing. Cook is unnecessarily secretive and uncommunicative with his son which one cannot help thinking is in there to spin the story out. But overall, it is book that holds your interest to the end."
2,Upside down fantasy history,"This fictionalized version of the Cook debacle is exactly what congressman S. D. Fess was talking about in 1915. He said then, before congress ""A group of people, some of them innocent and misled and others not classifiable in polite terms, have been busily engaged in trying to filch from Peary the credit due him as discoverer of the North Pole in the interests of Dr. Cook. Most Americans supposed that the Cook issue died a natural death years ago. The time will undoubtedly come when... the activities of this man and the press of the country will ultimately do its part against the circulation of perversions of history with respect to the great feat that Admiral Peary achieved, an honor of which through all future ages no nation can rob us.""Fess would undoubtably kick about in the grave to read this novel! As unbelievable as it seems, some people are still back in 1915 ""filching"" from Peary. If that is your cup of tea, this is your kind of history-fiction."
1,Not what I expected,"This CD was certainly not what I was expecting or hoping for. Instead of beautiful pipe organ music most of this CD is bells ringing very loudly and then the organ plays very softly. While listening to this CD I spent most of my time turning the volume down when the bells are ringing and then cranking it up when the organ was playing. When he is playing the organ it is wonderful. Unfortunately, that is not very much of the time on the CD. I feel I wasted my money on this one."
5,"Wonderful recording by ""the Master"".","This is a wonderful recording of not only Christmas organ music, but carillon bells. (Recordings of carillons are difficult to find.) In my opinion, the recording is fantastic, and the interpretation of the classics by Richard Purvis is excellent. (We'd all like to be able to ""play it like Purvis""!) Don't be dissuaded by the earlier review that said the bells were too loud - I think they are fantastic. One of the wonderful things about organ music is the ability to play as quiet as a whisper, or as loud as thunder! This recording does that, and the organist really puts the instrument through the paces. (It will really put your HI-FI systm through the paces too - a must if you are looking to test out that new subwoofer you just acquired!) Definitely recommended."
5,You'll Love this Knife!,"I have a great collection of Zwilling knives, and recently picked this one up to complete my set. I'm so glad that I did! It's the perfect knife for trimming meats and deboning chicken, etc. The handle is weighted perfectly for me, and the blade is as sharp as it gets. If you love playing around in the kitchen as much as I do, you've got to pick one of these up and give it a try!"
2,If it looks to good to be true.... (sigh),"We all know the saying: ""If it looks too good to be true, it probably is""-- well, that is no exception in regards to this over hyped CD. With wonderful selections such as LOVING YOU, SOMEONE ELSE'S STORY, and ALL I ASK OF YOU~ I could hardly wait until my copy arrived in the mail. I have since realized that beautifully written music cannot make up for an artists not-so-beautiful vision of how they should be performed. Nicastro abandons all meaning that the words hold and opts for a sugary pop version of EVERY song! If you are looking for the theatrical talents of a woman who knows how to hit it on the head let me suggest Bernadette Peters, Liz Calloway, Kristin Chenoweth, Marin Mazzie, Audra McDonald, Emily Skinner, or Alice Ripley, to name a few. Nicastro will ultimately leave you unsatisfied..."
2,Wouldn't Recommend it,"I bought this camera about a year ago and haven't ever had any problems with it until very recently. I turned my camera on, and it wouldn't work. The screen said ""Lens Error."" I then turned it off and on again. After this the camera worked but the lens wouldn't focus on anything. This seems to be a problem quite a few people have experienced. Other than that it takes great pictures, but I wouldn't recommend buying one."
4,Good camera but not sure about the build quality,It worked fine for a year but stopped working 2 weeks after the warranty expired.
1,the Worst Camera Ever!!! Don't buy!!!!,"I have this camera for a little over a year now and it is by most the worst camera I have ever had. It has been sent back to Cannon 3 times and it is still not working right and each time they tell me that I dropped the camera and broke the lens. When I told them I didn't and maybe it had to do with the shipping they tell me it can't be since the box is okay when delivered. I have a service contract on this product and it still have cost me almost $100 to get it fixed each time, I really wish I had never purchased it in the first place. And after this time i will never purchase a Cannon again."
