2,Boring play on a major world event,"Somerville did research this work well, repeatedly using footnotes to show where different quotes came from. Unfortunately, the primary goal of a play is to interest the audience. While the Cuban Missile Crisis was a major event, Somerville somehow manages to craft a dull play out of it. Useful as a history moreso than as a play. Especially annoying to me was how simplistic major world figures came across as acting, as if they were cardboard cutouts in daytime soaps. Not recommended."
4,Classical Techno,"If you really love the movie Das Boot, this is a pretty good CD. I bought this CD thinking it would be a good soundtrack to the movie. It is good, but not great. Most of the songs don't even remind you of the movie.However, if you're into techno and would like to hear some of the old and groundbreaking techno-beats, this is an awesome CD. It is obvious that this CD is made with pretty low-tech equipment. But it teaches you a lot about the youth of techno."
3,"Not the soundtrack, but decent","A bunch of rocking, techno rhythms inspired by Das Boot. Not the soundtrack, but decent dance music."
5,Great book,"I really enjoyed this book. Mario Cuomo really has a strong grasp on the most important issues of today. His views should be those shared by moral americans. As he says we are not all just 250 million lone horsemen riding off into the sunset, we're all in it together. It is our unity that keeps us strong. I agree with Cuomo that the Republicans are all just a bunch of babbling bafoons filled with greed. They are always pandering to the basest fears of people. Man's basest nature is greed and desire for control over other humans....... The Republicans embody all of that. Greed and Control."
4,A very good book on policy,"While the book is old, Cuomo's vision of America is timeless. This is an excellent promulgation of a progressive policy agenda and rebuttal of fundamental conservative arguments. It is truly a shame that Governor Cuomo was never able to implement his vision as president."
3,Thoughtful and inspiring for discouraged liberals,"In an age of cynical self-interest, Cuomo's book is water to a thirsty liberal soul. Informative, but neither academic nor inaccessible, Reason to Believe is a sermon and apology for compassionate liberal values as an antidote to the Contract with America's economic social Darwinism."
3,Hmmmm....,"A band that takes a song name from Quicksand and has Page Hamilton's ripping skills? If I wanted that I'd listen to Quicksand or Helmet. Do check out these fellers other albums under the ""Hurt Process"" though; it sounds a lot like the genre that I dare not say but we all know. But it's good (not to mention Derek Hess put some art on it and Derek Hess rules)."
3,Interesting subject but very negative,"I really liked the subject matter but every chapter started out so negative it was depressing until you got to the end of the chapter which was usually positive and hopeful. I do not agree with the Freud concept that all children want to have a sexual relationship with their mother. That is just disturbing and I believe the problem was Freud's warped fixation on the subject. If you ignore those references or take them with a grain of salt, the rest is very enlightening and interesting."
5,Important book for everyone,This book has remained relevant and through the years. I have suggested many times to clients. Has offered very good perspective.
2,Lost time reading Necessary Losses,"I ended up reading this book for a school assignment, I chose the book on my own because a friend recommend it.I mildly liked the book. I thought that it was long and drawn out. Viorst obviously is a fan of Freud, I felt like I was reading his biography because she quoted him so much.The other thing that bothered me is that she makes many statements like they are fact. Where does she get her information and how does she really know? Really? If you hear something long enough people tend to take it as reality. I thought that many of the chapters were way too long and tedious and unnecessarily graphic.Now who really thinks they long to have sex with their opposite sex parent or same sex parent as a baby? Give me a break. The worst part is I have to write a 3 page review of this book and that isn't enough space to point out all the unnecessary garbage in the text.Unfortunately I can't get back the time I spent reading this dribble. Oh well, I must grieve and move on..."
5,Great book.,Excellent book. Enlightening. Goes to the core of many emotional conflicts; explained in a way that the normal person can understand.
5,necessary losses,"This book touches on many topics we need to deal with as we age. It was good to find a references that deals with all these losses, that are really just transformed into changes stripped of the anxiety."
2,Should have been a pamphlet,"There were some great parts and some really tedious parts. Unfortunately, the tedious parts made it mostly unreadable. It had some great ideas that should have been put into a pamphlet. Instead, it seems like the author just put in a ton of quotations and repeated the same ideas over and over in order to fill enough content to make it a book. It was drastically unnecessarily wordy. It was very hard to force myself to continue reading just to get to the rare gems of great ideas. Finally, I gave up."
5,"Informative, sad and happy.",I bought this book while my mother was dying of cancer. I have referenced some of these stories with actions that I saw my mother having. Good read and easy read.
1,untrustworthy,"For two months, this unit hummed along beautifully, performing at or above expectations. Then this morning, with no more than 3% capacity filled, it started clicking and stopped working. At least 100 hours of work disappeared in an instant.Sure, this happens to everyone, and everyone's supposed to have a backup, but this was the backup. Do I need to backup the backup? I guess, so ... just not with a Toshiba."
1,Defective Unit,"Tried subject Drive on two different G4 Mac Powerbook computers, each using Tiger OS 10.4.1. Tried both the 2.0 USB cable and the DC cables and then used a hub. Never could get the drive to function. No e-mail response from Toshiba tech listed in the guide. Finally tried Repair/Replacement which was not helpful.Contacted Amazon and said after several hours of frustration had concluded that the Unit was defective.No problem with returning it to Amazon. They will refund. Didn't care for a Toshiba replacement and will purchase some other External Hard Drive. This may be a good Unit when it works, but my experience with it and Toshiba tech support was unsatisfactory. Amazon get 5 stars. The defective Unit a zero."
4,Full of Erotic stories,"I purchase erotic books of all kinds and love good stories full of hot sex. This book is full of hot erotic stories, each chapter is a different story so you are never bored you stay hot while reading this book. I enjoyed some of the stories more than others that is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. If you like hot erotic gay stories then buy this book."
4,Hot Truckers!!!,Great book for those lazy Sunday mornings when you just wake up - and you're alone. Some stories are hotter than others but all are worth reading. Keep it in your nightstand for those evenings or mornings when you need a little light and fun reading.
2,Short stops on the long haul,"Twenty pornographic short stories about long haul truckers and those who admire them. These adventures are advertised as ""true"" (which I very much doubt) and suffer from a lack of variety. Too much of a mediocre thing."
2,Barely acceptable,"Comfort: I've worn this pair about 6 times. It is not comfortable. It squishes the top of the foot and shapes it to the shoe. Also, I believe due to poor manufacturing, both heels scrape my heels and the felt has worn out on the hard spot. This shows how poor quality the shoe is after 6 wearings.Bottom: The treads on the bottom are very shallow. It will probably wear out too quickly. At first, it is slippery on carpet. I actually took a blade and cut 3 extra grooves in each heel, to have it grip more. The shoe is also slightly heavy due to the dense foam used on the bottom. But it doesn't seem to be durable.Style: very average, but the width is not too skinny or fat.I did not think this shoe was that bad until I went back to my pair of Unlisted that was about the same price and worn around the same amount of times."
2,You Don't Always Get What You Pay For,Price was high; Book was about the size of a comic book and did not contain complete information. Sorely disappointed!
2,it leaks,"After a few months it started leaking from the soap cap. We have to be sure we rest it on the brush side when we're not using it, so the soap stays in."
5,Current concepts based on thorough research,This is a contemporary approach to Leadership; based upon thorough research and extensive use. A good instrument for use in a leadership workshop for managers and managers to be.
5,Worth Every Penny,"This package has everything you need to become a better leader and conduct leadership workshops for a political or religious group, friends, students, or at the office. Working through the whole package is so much more effective than just reading The Leadership Challenge. The software and workbook are essential! My graduate students in our communication and leadership program--all working professionals--think this material is excellent. The strong research-base means you can be confident when adapting the strategies to your context. This package will change you into a more effective leader no matter what kind of work you do."
2,Leadership Practices Inventory,There was no 4 page inventory insert.Where can I get one?D.Charles Williams
4,sweet cinnamon,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Had to request a replacement for the 1st order - not packed well/spilled. However, sent a replacement very fast w/o any hassle. Will gladly buy from this company often."
4,Carmina Burana...,It's a decent box set for the price. I'm glad that I finally found a version of Carmina Burana that sounds decent...Four stars...
2,Fragile Boston Terriers? WRONG!,"The author said in this book that Boston Terriers are fragile...not true. These dogs have solid muscle, some weighing 25 lbs. The author obviously never seen a Boston Terrier if he called them fragile. Their ears are natural pointy ears, so they are not floppy eared dogs that needed to be surgically cropped. Also, Boston Terriers bark only when necessary and are good guard dogs. This author needs to stop writing such false information on dog breeds. Maybe he got it mixed up with a Min-Pin or a much smaller breed?I don't recommend this book since there are false information about dog breeds such as the Boston Terriers, since I have owned Bostons since 31 years ago."
1,Inaccurate information,"This book, although well written, has some incorrect information. I work in Pit Bull rescue, so I feel I have some ground to stand on when I say that this book provides wrong information about Pit Bulls and related breeds. For info regarding bully breeds, see [...]"
1,Lies and deceptions,"I'm not quite postive where this author has received his information from, but his description of bull breed type dogs is the furthest from the truth. I can't believe that such blatant lies can be published and BELIEVED by the public. This type of misinformation is akin to racists and holocast deniers publishing books."
1,Shamefully inaccurate,"The author does a disservice to several breeds in the book, most notably the American Staffordshire Terrier (AmStaff). He states what is most likely his opinion on the characteristics, traits, and pros and cons. If he would have properly researched the subject, the reader would know that there is far more to the breed than what you see on tv, in the newspapers, and in this poor book. Yes, this breed is capable of horrible acts, but so are dozens of others. If the author would have checked statistics compiled over the last several decades, then he would know that the AmStaff, and the American Pitbull Terrier were in the 10th percentile.....from the bottom.Bottom line: Don't waste your time and money on this, or any other of the author's books. You can get more accurate dog information from local breed organizations, and people who actually know the beed that they are talking about."
1,too much missing,"Not enough breeds covered in this book. ALL the AKC breeds should be in the this book to make it worth reading. The AKC Australian Shepherd is missing for example. My 1988 book The Perfect Puppy includes this breed. Many more AKC breeds are left out, all the Belgians, the American Eskimo, the list is too long to put here as well as some very popular non AKC breeds like Catahoulas or the Flock Guardians . Not much new to offer in this book. There are many more books that do a better job, check out the Perfect Puppy by Benjamin Hart."
1,More like a 3rd grade play than a movie about intervention,"I purchased this DVD to show to a class in treatment for addictions...and within 20 minutes, all 30 or so of us voted to turn it off and do handouts instead. The movie is dry, unrealistic, and too tortuous to show again."
4,Inspired me to read more,"This was the first book on reincarnation I have ever read and it was a great start. Edgar Cayce was the founding father of metaphysics in the West and, therefore, a perfect basis for a beginner. I learned the facts I needed to know and the places I needed to go next in order to explore my interests and beliefs."
5,Ever wonder why rotten stuff happens to good people?,"There is a reason why two-thirds of our planet's population believes in and embraces reincarnation. Although it's been centuries in coming, Westerners are beginning to accept this ""philosophy"" as truth, as well.If you've ever been curious about reincarnation on any level, this book will serve as an excellent introduction to this phenomenon. Elwell Sparrow's clearly-written book is based upon the readings and teachings of world-reknown psychic Edgar Cayce, himself a Christian. However, if you are of a different faith or spiritual belief, do not let that disuade you from reading this book!After reading this moving, exciting book, many of your questions will be answered. This is a highly informative book, and at its conclusion, you may find that reincarnation (at its most fundamental level) is the fascinating commonality among the world's religions and peoples.I highly recommend it! It changed my outlook on life forever."
4,All too true,"I was there, and I found this film accurate. I have less nostalgia about the period though because, though it was a period of unrestrained hedonism it was also a period of transition and upheaval. In a very short time we went from total anonymity to visibility, and the experience was jarring for those in the gay community that took part and those looking on. This was not quite underlined in the film. While it was true that sex was lying around waiting to be picked up, this came at a price. The price was intimacy. Liberation came to mean being able to be promiscuous without shame; this had its upside. However, by and large, it didn't seem to diminish loneliness or desperation for a lot of people, and for many others it barred connection. The film portrayed the times honestly, and it was good to see the survivors as well as to remember those who didn't survive."
4,Eye opener,"As a resident of this movie's location, the Village, I now look out at the old pier foundations with a knowing smile on my face. I'm not gay, I'm not male, I wasn't around for most of the Seventies, but I don't have to be to enjoy this film. New York City has such a juicy history, that being a resident and ignorant of it is something of a crime. This movie opened the door to a particluarly juicy part of it! Go see it, you'll have a blast, whatever your orientation."
4,Gay Sex in NYC in the 70's,"I'd heard much controversy about this documentary and how the title should have included the words ""in NYC'.This film is a raunchy delve into the outrageous socio-sexual underworld of gay men in NYC in the 70's.At times, while watching it, I wondered if I was actually watching a retro porno video; only to realise that it wasn't porn, but what was actually happening in real life then!This film brought back many memories for me, as even though I grew up in Perth, Western Australia, all that was happening in NYC was reflected here and we all longed to visit ""The Village"" and Studio 54, lived, danced and drugged like we were there ourselves.Let's face it, the 70's were the best if you were of that age and lucky enough to enjoy a Renaissance time worldwide.I think this is a wonderful memoir of the time and of how beautiful all the men looked then. It's definitely worth watching at least twice!"
2,Five people in a room talking about sex,"This documentary celebrates a 12-year period between the Stonewall riots in 1969 and the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in 1981, a decade of gay sexual liberation. Unfortunately, the film is very limited to the New York gay scene, and to the experiences of five or six men who giddily recount their youthful days of irresponsible and hedonistic, drug-fueled lust. After its first 10 minutes of showing these men revel in their experience of finding anonymous sexual partners, and the frequency of these encounters, the documentary quickly grew tiresome and repetitive, and purveyed a somewhat sad and empty soullessness about their experience. At least the film doesn't preach about how more medical research money needs to be dedicated to curing AIDS so that the lifestyle of bathhouse orgies and rampant drug use can be restored for a younger generation of gay men."
5,A Must See For Every Gay Man!!,This is a great Documentary not only about Gay Sex in the 70's but also about being a Gay man in the hayday of 1970's NYC. It's about a movement of sexual freedom. It's about survival. It's about people. It's about us. You won't be disappointed.
3,WELCOME BACK!!,"HOW GREAT TO HEAR CHIP TAYLOR'S VOICE ONCE AGAIN!! I'VE BEEN A FAN FOR YEARS, I STILL HAVE ALL THE OLD ALBUMS ON VYNL!!! THERE ARE SOME GREAT SONGS ON THIS C.D, HOWEVER, I COULD LIVE WITHOUT THE CLIPS IN BETWEEN SONGS!!! I'M SURE 'OL CHIP IS TRYING TO MAKE A POINT HOWEVER, I FIND IT A BIT ANNOYING!! I'VE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO BURNING MY OWN COPY AND TAKING ALL THOSE PARTS OUT!!ANYWAY, I STILL LOVE THE MUSIC!! CHIP IS KEEPING EMOTIONAL SINGING ALIVE!!!"
1,Ewwww...!,"Just when I thought we could FINALLY forget about ""Angel of the Morning"" -- tied for Ultimate Ickiest Lyrics Of My Generation only with ""Afternoon Delight"" -- here's more? Oh please go back to talking with horses, only horses, and spare us poor humans."
2,Big if you read at a 5th Grade level,"Building Big reminds me of a book I owned as a boy called ""How do they build it?"" Slick pictures of giraffes and elephants building dams and skyscrapers. This book isn't much different. Skinny on the details, full of colorful pictures you might get from Maurice Sendak with a lobotomy. In other words, I'm dissapointed that a subject of such scope has been slighted here."
5,Great minds must think alike!,"I first heard (and bought) this album on vinyl freshman year college, 1976. Like many others who heard 'Renaissance,' I was totally smitten upon first hearing it on the radio. After buying it, the rest of the album didn't disappoint at all.After wearing the vinyl out, I found it on audio cassette in the '80s, and finally got it on CD. Ponty had an amazing group of artists playing with him. I still get goosebumps when listening to 'Renaissance.' Patrice Rushen KILLS on that piano solo! She went on to have an awesome debut album within the next year (""Shout It Out"" on Prestige Records - lots of luck finding it - Amazon, consider looking for that one, if possible).Between Jean-Luc Ponty, Noel Pointer, and Stephane Grappelli, jazz violin (fusion, funk, or traditional) was becoming a force in music. I could not have been happier!"
5,Classic Fusion,"This is a fusion classic, no doubt about it.If you've been turned off by some of JLP'sother music, give this a listen. It definitelystands out - most excellent !"
4,Polly Pocket Dance Party,"My granddaughter loves this Polly Pocket set. It is sturdily built and has held up well, even in the hands of her little brother. Polly Pocket Dance Party offers a different variety of clothes than in other sets, which was exciting for my granddaughter. I would recommend this set to any little girl who is a Polly Pocket fan."
2,"Cute, but not 3 cups!","I received this today and although it was cute, I was expecting it to be 3 cups. It only holds 1 cup, not 3. Amazon did make it easy to return at no charge to me, though."
3,Really really small,"This coffee press is great but only holds 12 liquid ounces. Not 3 cups worth - 1 1/2 cups worth. The handle gets in the way when you try to put the strainer into the beaker to press down. You need to maneuver it into the beaker at an angle. Annoying but is still a pretty good press. Would buy a bigger one, next time. Much bigger."
2,I see now this item may be discontinued,"I moved to a new town where the architecture is quaint and where S-bucks may not exist within sight. It's kind of refreshing to live in a town that has no S-bucks. They do sell coffee at the grocery stores though and it's nice to have a rewarding cup of coffee, which can reliably be had via the French Press (invented by Italians in France, I heard). I had to order it online because fru-fru specialty paraphernalia are not sold by the sensible folks of this town. The picture was deceptive. 3 cups sounded like a generous single serving, but when grounds were added, about 3 tablespoons volume remained for the water! I'm giving it an extra star because I was so dumb."
5,Love it all around but it's not 3 measuring cups (could be 3 espresso cups?),"Yes, it's not metal at the base and the cover, but for the price, I can't complain much at all! After a friend of mine gave me this for me more than 2 years ago to discover what French Press is, I fell in love with it for being so compact and not needing filters like popular super bulky coffee maker. I should have known a long time ago as the regular coffee maker is not only difficult to clean, but not practical to make coffee only for one person/one cup. Since then, I've used those expensive kinds with metal casing, as well as other companies' French Press, but this one is for my practical every day use. I drink 1 cup of coffee in the morning, and 1 cup in the afternoon, but it's still going strong. One note is that this does not provide 3 cups of coffee as it states, but only enough to pour in a 12 oz coffee cup. I'm guessing it meant 3 espresso cups? Anyway, it's a great value!"
2,Was pretty good until the beaker cracked,"This French press was good for one (medium-sized) cup. Finer granules tend to get through. After less than six months, the beaker developed a large crack (possibly from the dishwasher) and is subsequently useless.... I am currently shopping for another one, possibly a bit bigger..."
2,Not a 3 cup!~ only 1.5 cups very small!,"This is only 12 oz (8 oz are in a cup) so it is very small. I wish I paid more attention before i put it on my wishlist and someone bought it for me, I had to buy myself the size I wanted! But am keeping this for a rainy day incase i break mine ( I broke my 1st one from Ikea...)"
5,better and cheaper than a cup at some major chains.,"I bought the coffee press for work, It's a perfect single serving size of coffee. I absolutely love it. Handle feels a little flimsy at points, but it didn't stop me from giving it a 5/5."
1,Small flaw makes press USELESS over time,"After about 9 months of use, the small plastic piece that keeps the filter screens in place begins to loosen and slide up the plunger rod. That makes the press useless. I'm not the only one with this problem.Bodum was cutting corners when they used a plastic pressure fitting instead of a metal threaded piece.I contacted Bodum and they told me to buy the metal piece they should have used in the first place that's standard on all their other presses for 2.99 + 5.99 (shipping). I'll eventually buy one but in the mean time I bought the 48oz Bodum Chambord press. Its awesome."
1,NOT the same as the larger models -- too small to be useful,1. This unit is too small - even for one cup it isn't big enough2. It features an inferior filtering mechanism (I figured everything would be the same as the larger models .. I was wrong)3. The pictures don't give any feel for the actual size of the productStinks ... on ice
1,Don't waste your money!,Just because the name says Bodum doesn't mean this press is a quality product. This must be the worst press I have ever used. I used this for about three days and realized it was very a frustrating process to use this press. The overall design is very poor. The handle is attached the the base and clean up is very difficult as the plunger is hard to get off since the handle is ALSO attached to the rim of the glass. I would give this less than one star if I could.
1,Don't buy,"I was really excited to get this because my roommate has a french press and I love the ease of use. Unfortunately, this ""3 cup"" maker only makes 1.5 cups, plus the .2 cups or so of volume required by the plunger (otherwise it will spill on your counter). In the end, this is enough for a small cup, not even a nice healthy mug. The product is nice quality, but this is such blatent false advertising that I'd have never bought it if I'd seen this. Seriously, imagine you order a 50 inch tv online, but it's actually a 25 inch TV. OH WELL!?BS."
1,All good except for one fatal flaw,"This is a perfectly good budget french press coffee maker in every way except one. Unfortunately that one flaw is a deal-breaker and I'm going to buy a new one after owning this for a few months.The mesh and wire strainers are held in place by a little plastic nob that slides down the shaft. You can see the piece in the photo. This piece does not screw on and is made of plastic. It does a bad job of holding the strainer in place, in fact a very bad job. The result is that the whole coffee maker is basically useless. Too bad, and such a bizarre design choice. Why not just have it screw down?"
4,Bodum Coffee Press is Sturdy But...,"I reordered this product because when washing the coffee press, the glass was slippery and slipped out of my hands and broke. Bodum please make the cup with thicker glass for clumsy person like me."
1,would not recommend this french press,"I really liked my Bodum stainless french press/mug, so my boyfriend bought me one of the little ones for home. By 6 months, it was cracked all OVER the plastic container part. I only used it once a day and always gently handwashed it, although I believe it is supposed to be dishwasher safe. Unless you can afford or are inclined to buy a new French Press every six months, save your money and buy another brand. The customer service was very unhelpful as well. Basically, they told me I had no remedy, and that it wasn't defective. When I wrote them back inquiring if 6 months was its useful life, they simply ignored my email. so disappointed as I expected better from the company."
2,Poor construction,"After so much hype about this brand I decided to purchase this item to use at the office. All seemed OK until it came time to open the plunger. It sticks at the bottom every time, and is almost impossible to work loose. It is likely a deformity in the carafe at the bottom that causes this but regardless, the strainer portion of the plunger looks like it was designed in the 1950s and not updated since. About as non-tech as something mechanical can get. Otherwise, this was a nice idea. It would be worth five stars if the plunger did not bind or stick every time it was used."
1,Not 3 cups only 12 oz.,"Deceptive name. I assumed the name ""3 Cup Coffee Press"" would produce three cups. I received a tiny little beaker press, sent it back twice before I read the fine print in the ad. It makes 3- 4 oz cups = 12 oz. If the name says 3 cups, it should produce 24 oz, not 12 oz!"
2,3-cp French press coffee-make by Bodum,"If you're into tea-cup-size coffee cups, then this is a 3-cupper. If not, it's close to useless, as it is for me."
1,This is a 1 CUP press,"12 ounces = about the size of a Tall Starbucks coffee.I'm not sure in what universe Bodum lives that they call a 12 ounce press ""3 cups"". (in the end it makes about 10 ounces, if you think about the space for the grounds).I'm doing Bodum a service by making consumers aware of this so you can avoid buying it and they can avoid your complaints, if you're looking for a press that gives you more than 1 cup of coffee."
3,Decent,"I've had this for almost a year now and it's pretty decent.Pros:- comes apart for easy cleaning- glass is replaceable- dishwasher safeCons:- plunger assembly has plastic joints which make it very fragile. My plunger assembly fell of the counter and broke at the top joint. It still works, but it's just cheap.Compared to other cheap coffee makers, like the IKEA one, I prefer this because it's much easier to clean. The best option is to get a more expensive, all metal, coffee maker from the start instead of replacing these cheap coffee makers every year."
2,Perfect for ONE large cup of Coffee but BE CAREFUL!!,Perfect for ONE large cup of Coffee but BE CAREFUL!!I bought this because it was small and simple to use.CAUTION: After about 10 cups of coffee the paper-thin glass this item is made of cracked along the side.I will now buy another brand because I am afraid even the larger Bodum brand units have this same thin glass.
3,So average,"I bought this small Bodum alongside my 8 cup Pinzon, and its ok. It doesnt have a lot of style and looks cheap, but it gets the job done. I dont like that the handle ""clips"" onto the beaker/carafe. It means that you have to tilt the filter/press part to get it in (and the top of the filter/press has a cutout to account for this). I guess if you ever need to get a replacement beaker/carafe this would make the job easier, but I'd buy a whole new press at that point. And I also dont like the knob of the filter/press: its a ball not a, uh, pancake like my Pinzon. All in all, its just an average, ok press. I wish that I would have known about the colored ones that they will be releasing, because I would have waited to get a colored one."
1,Very poor and possibly dangerous device,"I have had several Bodum presses in the past but worn them down or accidentally broken them in the dishes. I have always been happy though.With this one its a different story. First, it should be more clear how small this thing is, but that's not really my largest concern. The press in this miniature device, is partly made of plastic (on other models it is metal). What's worse, it is the same plastic that European studies have shown that if heated, will be cancerogenous. That's really not something I want to press press into my 100 degree celsius coffee water. Do you?"
2,Only lasted a few weeks...,The glass is too thin. I had it only a few weeks and it broke while I was handwashing it with a sponge (and cut my hand of course). I think this is the third or fourth french press glass I've broken. I'm paying more and switching to stainless steel.
2,When is 3 cups not 3 cups..,"I should have read farther down in the description where it states 3 cup is only 12 oz in french press land. (?) I love the flavor of french pressed coffee & this press works fine. My irritation is that I like a BIG OL cup of coffee & was looking for 24+ oz serving - not the dainty little 12 oz that this pot provides. Why don't they just list it as a 12 oz pot instead of 3 cups? I will be buying the larger Bodum press, because it does work fine. I'm just cranky because I haven't had enough coffee today!!!!!!!!"
2,cheaply made,"This coffee press works, but it is very difficult to rotate the lid for pouring and pressing, as per the instructions, and it tends to leave too much water in the bottom after pressing. The fit and finish is rather poor as well. I recently ordered the 8-cup Chambord model and I think that will alleviate all of these problems. I would not recommend this coffee press."
3,Coffee Press smaller then thought,"Very cute and very small only holds one cup of coffee, it states 3 cups but in fact it is only one. Maybe I miss understood what was wrote about it. For the rest of you that wants to buy this press it is for personal use only just one cup of nicely pressed coffee."
1,an amateur camerahandheld vietnam docu,"Listen everyone. If you like me, will buy this movie, because you think you'll get a deep and well analized idea of, how it was to be a vietnam veteran - well you're gonna be disapointed. The video itself is filmed with a handheld camera, and is just very amateurish in my point of view.The film is also quite short, so I'll recommend everyone who is especially interested in The vietnam war, the veterans etc, to seek elsewhere, because this film is just not worth the money. Trust me"
4,Very nice case,"The build quality of this case is very good. It feels solid and has survived a bit of travel. I love that it does not come with sleeves and that it is made for jewel cases.I was surprised that the rear hinge is an open loop. That means once the lid is fully opened, you can remove it by lifting upward.If you remove the upper lid, and then fail to put it on properly, or guide the lid closed improperly, it will put heavy strain on the hinges and cause the wood to crack. I would give the product 5 stars if it did not have this one flaw. Perhaps they should just use a regular hinge."
1,Eminem Recharge,This movie was horrible there was nothing really on here about eminem i thought that this was a real documentery but it is not. this was a waste of a half hour. all the guys in this film talked about how he inspired them. there was 1 or 2 songs that i did like but the rest was crap i'd rather watch barney than this shit. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't
1,awful,"I was expecting a cool documentary talking Eminem's life maybe interviews with people that have worked with him or know him personally, nope not at all. Basically nothing about Eminem and just a bunch of British rappers trying to promote themselves. There was at least 3 music videos on here by other rappers!. waste of money!!!"
1,False advertising,Was crap I thought I was getting an eminem DVD but its just a bunch of nobody's talking about him was hugely let down
3,A Reasonable Collection,"This is a reasonable selection of works to start with as a child's introduction to Classical music. There are two main flaws - a handful of the pieces are performed rather poorly and the sound quality is muffled. But keeping the intended audience in mind and the price, it's not a bad value."
1,Hard to get into this book.,I have not read any of Muriel Spark's novels before and found it hard to understand even when I tried to keep on reading.
5,True Hip Hop Heads,This album is a summary of Biz's early career. It is definitely a classic and a true delight for the 25 & over crowd.
5,"""How"" could this not be a hit!",I was at a music store at the mall when I ran across this single; and to be honest the only reason I bought it and wanted to hear it was because I saw it featured Me'lisa Morgan. Anyhoo! upon listening to it I could'nt stop. There is just two things missing and that is a little more re-mix gadgetry and some air play and bam! he has a hit on his hands. Still I can't control what's meant to be or should I say what's not. All in all this is good material from an old school pro with A little new school flavor!
5,How,I think this single is super wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it. and will play it over and over again. I think the lyrics and the theme of the song is just great.
1,A Poor CD,"This cd is not worth it. I bought it at a local music store for $2.00, and i would not even buy it for that. Jt's voice is great, maybe better than ever, but the music is terriable. This song is totally not JT's style. I was expecting a better cd from Jt, since of the 6 year lay off. If you're looking for the old JT, you wont find him on this single, and probably not on the new cd on June 6th. The only way you will find him, is a tour w/ Kool and the gang. Jt- for your fans, make a cd w/ your style, or go back to kool and the gang. I gave the cd a one for his voice, but not the song."
2,Disappointed,"""Get it from the Bottom"" is NOT the 1969 version I expected. There are a couple of decent tracks on the CD, but nothing sufficiently compelling, even at just $4.56. I'd undo this purchase if I could.(Nothing bad to say about the seller, seanmart, though. Got just what I ordered and delivery was prompt. Would shop there again.)"
1,FORGET ABOUT IT!,IV'E BEEN A HUGE UFO FAN SINCE THE MID 1970'S BUT THIS DVD CATCHES ONE OF THE LOW POINTS OF THEIR CAREER. ALMOST PAINFULL TO WATCH. SAD! JUST SAD!
4,The Romanization System is Now a Serious Problem,"This is a fine book, one I have assigned for years in my introductory classes along with de Bary's Sources of Chinese Tradition Vol. 1. Now, however, there is a new edition of Sources using the newer pinyin romanization system. Reischauer still uses the old Wade-Giles system. So I can't assign it any longer - I can't expect my students to have the two basic books in the course use different romanizations. Could not Houghton-Mifflin redo Reischauer using pinyin? It could be done with no effort by using a simple replace function on a computer."
3,I can't believe it...,"I remember buying this textbook back in the '80's for a course at Harvard taught by the professors themselves. Back then, the book cost [money]. I can't believe they now want over [money]for it. That's insane. Sure, it's full of factual information, but it's hardly unique information -- these are historical facts available anywhere, with very little opinion or perspective or even personality woven in. (Indeed, the book is as dry as the Gobi Desert.) Furthermore, they first published this book back in 1975. Updating it could not have required that much labor. Publishers are getting away with extortion knowing they have a captive audience (students) required to buy their textbooks. Yes, it's a good textbook. Is it worth over [money]? Not for a Chinese minute. Here's hoping that the publishers donate their profits to North Korean famine relief."
1,Frightening,"I certainly hope Ray Broderick is not actively interviewing children and I desperately hope the courts do not listen to his analysis as there will most certainly be excess adults in prison for false accusations of abuse of all kinds. Ray's approach is misleading children more than some offenders have done. I do not condone this at all! There is brainwashing, leading to obvious ends that a child would love to answer in favor of condemming someone due to the rewards as opposed to the correct response. When we do this, we also damage our children. I say no, absolutely no, do not support this team at all. Horrible book and depressing."
4,Nice case for CDs.,"This case actually holds almost 800 discs in thin sleeves. It has 4 rows and each one is about 16"" deep, so you should measure the disc space that you need. (About 60"" of disc space). It has the dividers built in and they have plastic strips on top. The case has black carpet on it and seems sturdy. The lid is removeable and works well. The discs stick up over the case edge about 1"" and the lid goes over the top of the sleeves. The plastic strap handle seems to work well for the weight. They also make a 3 row case if you want a smaller case.Overall a nice case with 60"" of disc space if you like this kind of case. I use it for DVD and CD+G discs and I like it alot."
5,Still a great book !!!!,"I read this book many (too many) years ago and on a whim purchased a copy through Amazon....it is still a great adventure story aimed at an older teen audience, full of adventure and lessons to be learned, although I doubt that a modern youth would be allowed the latitude to pursue the adventures that the book's ""hero"" enjoyed. Still great to read again after all this time!"
2,What a disapointment!,"This book had such praise and wonderful reviews that I could not wait to read it.It started off well enough, but I soon realized that it wasn't so much a novel with a plot, but a series of dismal snapshots into the tarnished life of a boring family. There were just too many family members with similare traits to keep straight. I wish that there had been more of Molly's boarding school experience; that part was interesting. By the end I was tired of the family, the repitition of the lamenting of a gentile life lost etc.If you want an Irish coming of age in the 50s/60s any of Maeve Binchy's earlier books will be much more captivating!"
1,"not as good as the first ""Creative dating""","The original Creative Dating was fabulous- and had some great ideas for group, single, and ""married couple"" dating. I got this book out-of-print on amazon, and found it was 100% humor. If you read Creative Dating (a GREAT BOOK), please know that this book is humor only."
4,Good consumer reference but dated,"A fine consumer legal reference, even if a bit dated. The book offers much practical advice and certainly is recommended, especially if you can obtain it at a bargain price.I do not understand why Consumer Reports (and Reader's Digest) do not offer *up-to-date* versions of their legal guides. Such publications are greatly needed, especially in today's litigious world."
1,Seemed like a good phone...,"This product seemed like it had all the features I was looking for and the reviews seemed pretty good, however it had an awful annoying echo sound whenever I talked on the phone. It also from time to time had static. I thought the echo sound was just on my end but the people on the other end of the phone coverstation said that I sounded like I was in a cave. I returned the product right away! I'm not sure if it was just the phone I got, but I would not recommend this product!"
3,telephones,"The phones were OK. They are easy to set up. The wall mount, is awkward and not as attractive as I thought. I do not like that I can't shut off the sound on the answering machine. All incoming messages are boradcast."
4,best yet,"best phone yet the only downside is the ringer volume, it's too low but it does light up with an incoming call."
5,Great Product,Works great. The speakerphone is awesome!! The only function that is annoying is that the calller ID numbers have to deleted from all the different phones seperatly. Great sound. Definetly recommend it.
2,Great reception BUT not a wall phone,"After going on Uniden's website and reading that this phone can be wall mounted, I bought it specifically to replace a wall phone in the kitchen. After attaching the adaptor, I found that the phone hangs at a 90 degree angle from the wall (i.e., in the same position it would sit on a desk)...a very awkward arrangement to say the least. While the wall mount design didn't work for me, the phone quality was excellent. Bottom line...a very good phone, but don't buy it if you want to mount it on the wall."
1,Sound Fades,"I was very pleased with this phone at first....however....frequently, during a conversation the sound fades so severely that I could not hear the person on the other end of the phone. I contacted Uniden and they indicated that it was because the base was close to other electronics....which it wasn't. I have never had problems with a cordless phone before and I have had to end 3 conversations today because I couldn't hear what was being said to me. I would not recommend this phone because of this problem."
2,Phone is great... when it works,"I've had to return this phone several times. You can read about all the great stuff about this phone in other people's reviews. My comments will focus on the problems I've had. my first phone had issues with power loss. The handset would typically lose power and would not respond to any of the buttons. The only way to bring the handset back was to remove the battery and reset the handset. I returned this phone. My second phone had audio problems. The person on the other end could not hear my voice even though I could hear them. This would typically occur several minutes into a conversation for no reason. I took this phone back. My third phone has only a minor problem. The volume fluctuates between loud and soft. I'm willing to live with this because I don't want the hassle of returning yet another phone.If I were to buy a new phone, I would not buy this one and I would not recommend any of my friends or family to buy it either."
2,losing audio,"when it works--a great phone. Big problem --- when in conversation, lose volume almost completely on base handset. Uniden called 2 times -- tried system reset plus handset re-registration procedure..still have problem.Handset is not anywhere near electronics or my pc/wi-fi hook-up.no solution in sight :("
4,Great phone,So far so good with this one ! Reception is clear and has a lot of great features - even speakerphone ! The set up was extremely easy and I like the way you can retrieve messages on each handset. This is a great value.
5,Excellent phone,"I like the phone. I have this phone for about 2 months. Its price is reasonable. The phone delivers clear voice reception. The panel design is intuitive and easy to use. Speaker phone seems to work well. You can't go wrong with this phone. It basically meets all of my requirements: reliable, clear voice reception, easy to use, good speaker phone, good phone answering system."
4,Good so far...,"After reading some reviews on other phones, we decided to give Uniden a try again. So far, we have been very happy."
4,good w/couple cons,"We've had this phone for five months, and overall we're pleased and satisfied.Pros: Sound fidelity and amplification, ease of use.Cons:flawed transfer of caller id to phone book. room monitoring mediocre. short total recording time.Biggest irritation is the ""store number from caller i.d."" feature. When one stores the number into the phone book, the phone doesn't automatically add the necessary 1 at the beginning, as many phones do. So, for every entry, one must edit the number, press the arrow to move all the way left, then type in the 1. Frustrating! And you revisit the frustration every few days!Room monitoring has also dropped out a couple times, and has become a feature we use less than we might."
1,POOR for hearing aids..,"They say it's compatible.. well at first try, I charged it up overnight etc. then went to use it. The buzz/hum was SO bad I could barely hear the person on the other end and I had boxed it all up, ready to return it, but I gave customer service a call. It turns out that there is a 'code' that one has to manually change/turn off the T-coil inside the phones to make them more 'compatible' (i.e. get rid of the buzzing/hum)So I did that, and yes it did decrease the hum considerably, not completely gone but it did make a diff. Good I think.. that is until I made a call to test it, and the volume control went up.. as far as I could get it to go and it STILL wasn't loud enough, and the hum is still in the background. <sigh>This really looked like a cool phone, liked the features and I have to return it."
1,Phone has great features but terrible reception!,I really wanted to like this phone. It was easy to set-up. Easy to use. Answering machine is simple. BUT the reception on this phone was terrible for me. I moved the base around my house but still no good. I couldn't even walk into my master bedroom without static and I don't have a large house. I'm returning it!
1,Lousy range,"This is my third set of wireless phones, the other sets died of natural and un-natural causes - I thought the higher gig range would make for better long range reception, but these are by far the worst of the lot. They don't work in a two story house, and if outside, forget it. Even though I have invested in two bases and five handsets, now that I don't need multi-line, I will be replacing these phones. Panasonic or Seimens were the better units."
4,Check your local store!,"Phones work great, but after I ordered the phones I discovered they were much less expensive at Circuit City and Best Buy!"
4,Funcionality,The only complaint i have is it is a little slow in dialing a number and the settings are a little hard to set upand they sometimes do not stay as you go along.
3,Uniden Cordless Phone,"I really like the design of the phone and all it's features. However, when I stepped outside my front door or even into my garage, I lost the connection until I returned inside. I returned the phone and was completely reimbursed (including shipping). Luckily I didn't lose any money at all. I purchased a Panasonic through Amazon and am much happier even though it was about $50.00 more."
5,Uniden TRU9465,"I LOVE THIS PHONE! It's the best phone I've ever owned. I have the base unit, it's one hand set, and two other hand sets. The sound quality is excellent, even when speaking with three other people (two on each end of the phone line). That had been my biggest complaint about all of my previous phones: When more than two phones are being used, the volumn from the other end would drop while the volumn from the extension at my end was ear-splitting. That dosen't happen with these phones.Range is fine. I have one hand set out on a back patio, which is about 25-30 feet and on the opposite side of glass sliding doors from the base unit and have had no problems with dropped calls or the phone being out of range.The speaker phone feature of the hand sets is also very good."
1,Hate it!,"This phone is terrible! Only had clear connection when near a base. Ring volume very low, even on high & had many complaints from callers-worst cordless phone ever had! don't buy!"
5,Nice phone system,"This phone system was to replace an old AT&T phone that was great until a power surge got it. The Uniden has proven itself a good phone system. We also bought an extra handset with it, TCX905. We have a two story home plus a basement. Reception is great throughout all the floors. My daughter also likes that intercom capability. We've had it for a month and it has been trouble free."
1,Lemon,"I have had many cordless phones and this is by far the worst cordless phone I have ever purchased. The phone works one day and not the next. I get ""OUT OR RANGE"" messages with the handheld just a few feet from the receiver. Numerous other unexplanable problems. There is a number to call for customer service, the problem is that so many calls are coming in you can't get through. It appears that Uniden is another victim of ""MADE IN CHINA."" I can't return the phone to Amazon since returns must be made within ten days. The good news is that I didn't throw away the old system that it was supposed to replace. From now on I'm sticking with Panasonic."
3,Ok phone,"I purchased this phone set with an extra extension. I use it in my office (the main unit) and the extra handsets are in the living room and bedroom. I am not happy with the fact that the headset tends to have issues in placing calls sometimes. I keep getting a message that says ""out of range"" and I am sitting right next to the main unit. It causes issues in placing calls and since I work from home it is really irritating. The phone is ok, but I am not just thrilled with it."
2,Uniden TRU9485-2,We rated this only 2 stars because of the range. We can't take the phone on our enclosed patio as the volume goes in and out. Otherwise we would have given 4 stars.
4,Great product to buy,"They are a nice pair of cordless phones. I use it on my VOIP connection. Sound quality is great. No interference no static. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is that. Unlike some other cordless phones, when you save a number in the phone book and after that person calls you, this phone does not retreive the name from the phone book but displays the default name from the phone company. If you are fine with that then go for it."
2,Good phones if you don't really need to use them,"This phone has been covered pretty well in the other reviews, so I'll just highlight my negative aspect. Hearing the person you called. This phone consistently would ""drop out"" so you would miss 15 - 30 seconds of conversation. The other side could hear you just fine. I tried moving all around the house, same effect. I moved the base station, same effect. I reset the phone per Uniden's direction on their web site, same effect. Bottom line: it's possible I got bad phones, but some small % of these phones have this defect (see other reviewers), I just had bad luck. I returned these and purchased Panasonic DECT 6.0 phones."
2,Very poor range,"Simply No excuse for the fact that the range on this unit is very poor.A voltage fluctuation burned the base-unit for my old Uniden set - not sure of the model# - but those came free with SunRocket in 2005 - so yes old - and with a stubby antenna on the handsets. But the old Unidens worked like a charm - no problems in any corner of our apartment - loved them.hence I went for Unidens again - hoping that the new model would be at least as good as the old ones if not better - but NO!There are lots of ""blank spots"" in our apt. where the reception just drops ... and even when I'm in range - the sound clarity is suspect ... with occasional clicks and hisses.Not sure if we got a lemon - but definitely not happy!And not a biggie but it is sad that the voltage adapter for Uniden is only 120V compliant!!"
2,Not as good quality as I'd expected...,"My husband and I have both been unhappy with our phone. First, it seems to be ""out of range"" at least once a week. This has even happened when we were about two feet away from the base. Quite frustrating to have the phone suddenly turn off on you. Next, the clarity is not that good. My husband hates it when I use them to talk to him at work because he can't hear me very well and says it sounds muffled. So, now we're looking for a new phone."
5,excellent,"Love all the cool features, and the clarity of listening and talking too. I like the fact that you can enter people/numbers into your Address book on one phone, and with the push of a button you can send those entries to any or all other phones with your system."
2,uniden cordless phone,the phone and answering system works well and is easy to use but I am having a problem with handsets losing volume when in use. Without warning I will have periods of being unable to hear the caller.. the volume drops and I can't hear the person calling. Volume interruption is intermittent and does return to normal.
1,Not happy,"One week after purchase, the product stopped working. We followed the manufacturers instructions and sent it to the repair center. We received in return a phone that was rebuilt. The original one year warranty was voided and a new 90 day warranty in its place. We only had the phone one week. This company evidently does not stand behind it's product or services. DO NOT PURCHASE."
4,A good buy with a couple minor gripes,This is a very nice set. It is very easy to set up and get started. I'll skip all my happy fluff and get right to the problems you will want to know.I'm docking one star for the following problems.*The belt clip is VERY CHEAP and pops off my belt frequently; thus my phone has taken a few falls because of this. I'm now used to just sticking it in my pocket instead.*When you delete the names from the caller ID list you have to delete the list off of each unit. You can't just push a button on the base and it deletes all of the caller id's from all the units. It gets old having to track down all the handsets and delete the same stuff.
1,Phones were a waste of money,We bought four of these units for our home. After 6 months they need to be replaced. Heavy static and they need to be used right in front of the sender unit. We will never buy another Uniden product. I came on Amazon to order something different and our phones are heading for the trash.
1,Do not buy this item!,"I gave one star, but I could give 0.This is the worst phone that I have ever had. I paid 44 dollars at Walmart and I am going to return it, the volume is horrivel and it makes a very strange noise, definitily lost of time and money."
5,Love it,"I love this system. It makes communicating with my husband when he is in the shop, so much easier.The best things are only having 1 base for multiple phones and each phone being a speaker phone."
5,Uniden,"An excellent system that works like a charm. Higly recommended. Two minor issues. (1) Battery life on a unit when off the charger pretty short due to display power requirements (2) Cannot dial off stored incomming caller id's since the system does not automatically inset ""1"" in front of the area code, when required. So just useful for recording the numbers."
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed. At various times there is static on the phone. I mainly notice it when I go upstairs (the base is down stairs in the kitchen). This shouldn't happen. For this price range, I really expected better. Never had this problem with my old Motorola cordless phone. Now I am wondering if I should buy something different."
4,good system for home,received this item in time. installed it. no issues thus far. expect to have no issues later. can not say that the sound quality is exceptional. good overall. the best feature is the keypad on the base with the speakerphone maiking it like a 3rd handset.
2,After 1 year...,"Nice attractive design. Can hear people good on it. my only complaint would be that it gets staticky two rooms away from the system. Otherwise, the battery holds charge well. No other complaintsUPDATE: well, having this over a year now. I will say it's junk. The battery doesn't hold up and the add'l phone some reason won't charge. I have also switched phones. Dont know what else to tell you. Stick to Panasonic !!"
1,cicle button in the middle crapped out on all 4 phones,"i bought this set and all the function buttons stopped working after a year or so.i opened up a couple to clean the contacts and that did nothing.cannot scroll through functions or redial, nothing. crap.good thing these are no longer available.purchased from amazon."
4,SOUND QUALITY AN ISSUE,"FOR ME THEE ONLY NEGATIVE ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THE AUDIO QUALITY. I FELT THAT VOICES LACKED SUFFICIENT MIDRANGE AND TREBLE, IN EFFECT THEY SOUNDED SLIGHTLY MUFFLED TO ME. FOR THAT REASON I RETURNEED IT AND PURCHASED A PANASONIC SYSTEM. OTHERWISE EVEERYTHING ELSE SEEMED EXCELLENT ABOUT THE PHONE."
3,Expected much better from Uniden.,"With all of the features that this phone has, I had very high expectations. Unfortunately, Uniden put too much effort into putting so much into this phone that they overlooked the basics. The sound quality is terrible.When speaking on the phone there is a lot of static and ghost voices in the background. The people on the other end of the phone line comment that it sounds as if you have the phone too close to your mouth or you are speaking very loud.I have had Uniden phones before and have always been happy with the quality.I may be weary of purchasing another Uniden in the future if the sound quality does not improve."
3,Short Distance,"Every positive reviewer was on the spot - except for the distance from which the handset can be away from the base.I can only go about 25 feet before the signal makes the call break up, as experienced when the call quality on a cell phone is bad with missing syllables, words, etc.I lose the call completely at 40 feet.I might as well have a corded phone with a long cord."
2,Doesn't Last,"Loved the features on this phone and have been satisfied with it for the first year and a half.However, now the display flickers, the speaker feature works intermittently, and the phones will not hold a charge.I'm not surprised really. What did I expect for the price?This is a good budget phone system but be prepared to replace it.Another con is that it does not provide a feature to auto dial the ""1"" before making long distance calls from caller I.D. My other phone permitted entry of local area codes and then autodialed the long distance prefix for other area codes."
4,"clear sound, easy interface, attractive design","I bought this set for my parents (who are not technologically inclined). To my delight, they found it straight forward to use. I did have to set up the answering machine and time/date, but that was all.The design and red/amber color are appealing. Buttons are well labeled and keypad on handsets are backlit well. I really like the keypad on the base. This makes handsfree/speakerphone calling very easy. The sound quality is very clear compared to some older panasonic and v-tech phones I've had."
4,Good Value,"Has a lot of features. The only deficiencies are the 12 minute recording time on the answering system with the option of limiting recorded messages to either 1 minute or 4 minutes. A longer recording time and an option of 2 minutes per message would have been nice. The tone quality is a little tinny but acceptable. The message alert sound feature is nice but it would be better yet if the LCD screen lit up when messages were waiting. Overall, this is a very nice 5.8 GHz phone for the money."
4,Good phone for good price,"This is our second purchase of a Uniden phone. We have had for three weeks. So far so good. Nice features, easy to operate. We like that we can expand to more hand sets AND the range outside in the backyard is great."
3,"Great features, but...","System features and ergonomics are excellent, but, voice quality to the ""outside"" is mediocre at best. Listening from an outside line, the voice quality sounds like you're speaking through a tunnel or tin can.I've tried each of the other two handsets at various ranges from the base and virtually no improvement observed.Incoming conversations through the handsets do sound crystal clear however.Additionally, it does also seem to be impervious to the wireless WIFI.So, if your not concerned about out going voice quality this might be the phone for you.Personally, I'm more than peeved and back to the service center it goes.Probably more hassle than it's worth and another indicator of just how far Quality Assurance (or lack thereof) has slipped."
2,Poor range,"Maybe I got a bad set but my handsets have very limited range away from the base. Once I get about 30 feet away, with 2-3 walls between the handset and the base, the static starts...then after moving further away another 10-15 feet I lose connection totally. Otherwise the sound was clear, though there was a faint, constant hum in the background. No interference problems with wifi."
5,Excellent System,"Have had this for about a month at the time of writing. Very pleased with it.Pros:Good audio quality. Easy to use, and program.Intercom between sets, and call transfer. Can pick up messages on any set. Can add up to ten sets. Can add different sets, for example, Uniden's Waterproof handsets.Cons:Cannot seem to use intercom in speaker mode on handsets."
2,FAULTY PHONE,"oNLY ONE OF THE PHONES WORK. THE OTHER ONE KEEPS SHORTING OUT. OVERPAID FOR THE PHONES, I FEEL THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING."
1,The adaptor does not lock in the main base,I was pretty excited about this product .... but since I received it about a week back I am trying to plug the adaptor cable in the main base (in the tiny yellow slot as said in the manual) ... trying to call the customer service ... once stayed 47 mins on hold and eventually the call got auto-cancelled ... but still I am not able to fix my problem.I think this cordless comes with a lot of inherent hurdles ... seems like u might have to first built a fort before u stay in it ....I wont recommend this product unless u go and buy from store.
2,UNIDEN TRU9485,"I was really disappointed with this UNIDEN cordless phone. Its range is too short for a large home use, mainly if it has brick walls. I do not recommend this phone to anyone."
1,damage immediately,One of the extensions ceases to function after 2 days. The ring sounds of the database first and wireless to five seconds after
2,A Quick Read if you're in the mood,"This book is a very quick read, and sometimes that's what we readers want. The idea behind this story is good, and the things it tries to teach are valid, but I'm sorry, the plot was quite unbelievable. To me it didn't seem realistic at all, and that detracted from what could have been. How much tragedy does one family have to face? How much coincidence is believable? All questions that come up while reading this book. I don't buy that a seventeen year-old? can make this kind of life decision. I also don't buy that a fifteen year old would make the kind of decision that this boy does at the end."
3,This book was a depressing and disappointing read.,"I was disappointed with ""The Color of Hope"". I felt that it could have been better than it actually was. The story centers around a financially comfortable couple from Boston, who have two children. One day, while summering in Maine, tragedy strikes when the family goes sailing, and their lives change for the worst. Just as things seem as they cannot get any worse, they do. I felt that the author overdid it with the depressing parts of this book. The middle of the story is very slow, but the end picks up speed. However, the reader is left disappointed in the long run."
2,no title for review,"Too much bad language. If my kids talked that way, they'd get soap in their mouths."
3,HOPELESSLY MELODRAMATIC,"I am not fond of soap operas. I am not fond of plotlines that are contrived, unbelievable, inconsistent, or unrealistic. I am not fond of characters that lack credibility. I am not fond of this book. Ms. Madison tried, but this story of family crisis fell flat.....I didn't care if they all drowned. One shouldn't feel that way about a story. I know all author's have a clunker story in them.....I hope this was Ms. Madison's, and the next book I read of hers, I will herald. I am really not fond of writing unflattering reviews!!!"
3,Great idea but pieced together in confussion.,"This is a good book except why would a newspaper company as world renown as the author proclaims not be able to raise $150,000? This did not make sense to me. If they were talking about raising $1,500,000 this would be different. I think the premises of the book is good but get real. We people of color have money or the means to raise the cash if something like this happens to us. I do like how Shay changed is mind on marriage but the author never discussed why he felt marriage was not a good institution. It seems like his parents had a good relationship so why they negativity? If Benjamin Brentwood had so much influence why would he get revenge on Kendra's father after 30 years for a love affair that had never really been developed? He really was a powerful man compare to Sammy. What really happend to the M.P.'s wife and why was he so crazy? There as so many unanswered question. I still think the author had a great idea."
3,Fair reading.,"This book was interesting, yet I found that there were too many unnecessary punctuation marks throughout the book. I began enjoying the book, but the extra commas and semicolon's threw me off. I really didn't finish the book, because my attention strayed."
5,SAWEEET SOUNDS!,"I love this album, it is just as good today as when I got it a few years back. I strongly recommend getting it to anyone who loves good music. They're on myspace also at www.myspace.com/imaginarybill"
2,Limited and disorganized,"Since this is the first Bonsai book I read maybe it is typical but I found the organization of the book lacking. There are no definitions of terms, the 'lessons' are very much summaries, and I felt confused throughout. I had hoped for more detail. Since I borrowed it from the library first I feel I saved some money as I would not buy this book having had a chance to read it first."
4,Good Book,The book has a several projects and step by step instructions the material and the quality of the pictures is very good complete inf. a little of everything it`s a must have
5,Bonsai School,What a beautiful collection of information and pictures. Written for easy non complicated read.
4,Good book to have!!,Quick shipping; and very nice beginners book to have! This book gives step by step instructions with nice photos to go along with it.
2,outdated but interesting,"One thing for sure that either the book is extremely outdated or the author was extremely ill-informed. This book is about the 2 days in the life of heart surgeon.If you have to read about heart surgeon please read the life Chritiaan Bernard - far more interesting and informative - does not babble with medical terms.Most of the book is babbling about cybernetics and from page one you will realize that this is rudimentary cybernetics. I learned cybernetics from Norbert Weiner's book so I realized what a bluff this is. If you have to read such trivial philosophy as in this book you can get it from Deepak Chopra (I mean you do not even have to go to Krinamurthy, Russell, Pauling).There are some comments about American doctors and their work ethics which are outrageous and wrong. By the time Russians were changing valves American doctors were doing heart transplants. The Russian equipments were outdated and never up to par. I will not recommend anybody to read this book"
3,A classic not quite the same material as I remember...,"I got this set for my 47th birthday after telling my 12 year old that I always wanted a Gumby and Pokey when I was little. She surprised me and I was quite pleased with it. I don't remember all the other charactrers that came with the set from my childhood but I do remember Gumby and Pokey. The figures are not as gummy as I remember. I don't think there's as much rubber or smushy plastic in them as there used to be and I miss that feeling as they were easier to pose with the old material. I was dissappointed with that but as I'm really not going to ""play"" with them it won't really matter. I porbably would've handled them more if they were more gummy and softer rubber..."
4,The whole Gumby family,"My Mother bought Gumby for my daughter when she was born, but she did not play w him very much. My son did though after he was born.. once he could talk and started to learn his colors he would always ask.. but where is blue gumby, where is red gumby, where is yelloe gumby... finally i have found the whole gumby family... he thinks only Santa brings Gumby because they are not sold at Target.... he will be very surprised this year to get all his Gumby's"
2,Needs more work done!!,Well the game is fun to play up until the point of trying to exit the first town. Note that I have done everything quest wise and upon exiting the west gate of fargrove the game crashes. I bought this version hoping it would not have any bugs like the first release. I am in Iraq right now and do not have internet access to download patches so I had my wife send me the collectors edition hoping it would solve my problem. It did not fix it. This game although fun to play has serious problems when it comes to crashes. I would have thought that this game being a collectors edition would have been near flawless in play. This game is truly a collectors edition for folks collecting unplayable games. It went right into my footlocker until I get home and can patch the game.
1,Please boycott this...,"Dreamweaver's handling of this whole mess was seriously screwed up. They release a product that is an insult to the gaming community. Then they have the nerve to add some more stuff and release a 'collector's edition'. I'm not a collector I'm a consumer. I was robbed by their first product which is more like an undergrad programmer's final project (on which he got a 'D').Don't buy this game and have nothing to do with this product line. Seriously reconsider before buying any of Dreamweaver's future products.They didn't drop the ball on this one, they threw it in our faces trying to give us bloody noses."
1,Public Service Announcement: Avoid This Game,"Dungeon Lords Collector's Edition is a waste of money. You will not enjoy it. You will feel robbed and you will be angry enough to write warnings such as this. Please, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!"
4,way important,"this game is a whole lot better. the first dungeon lords was way screwed up. i mean , REALLY screwed up. like, in the great tower, i was at the top and the elevator has a bug so i had to reset my file and there were many more bugs also. but this game isent any different exept for they fixed most of the bugs and most of the levels are fixed. like, in #1, there would be huge hotels and yet there was not one piece of furniture in it and there would be fireplaces to change time and yet there was no fire in it.DO NOT GO OUT AND BUY #1! this game is the same exept they added more levels and fixed every thing that they were supposed to do in the original dungeon lords. definatly recomended."
1,"Monkey developers, terrible game? What explains this?","How could this game be release yet again with so many bugs? Has anyone from Dreamcatcher actually played it? Something is wrong here... I waited until they could fix it (i.e. Collectors edition), hoping for the decent RPG it could of been, and this is their best? Someone has to lose a job here, because this is a complete failure. The physics are off, the game crashes, and locks up! The sound effects are terrible, the game play is clumsy. Don't buy this game, no matter what edition. Punish them please, avoid future titles, they must never attempt this again. Note to Heuristic Park/Developers: find another career. To everyone else: this is not worth your money. God awful trash."
4,dungeon lords collectors edition,i loved this game until i got my new computer now it wont play with windows 7 dose enyone know what to do e- mail pupperbabydog@comcast.net i am 73 and love to play games
1,Caveat emptor!,"If this game is offered as freeware, don't waste time or space downloading it. Herky jerky movement, detatched interaction:i.e., combatant & foes don't actually make contact, low quality graphics and illogical control functions combine to make this the worst RPG I have ever played. Starting with Well of Souls & Dink Smallwood, through the series of Diablo, Dungeon Seige, Neverwinter Nights, Baldar's Gate, Arcanum, Sacred, Divine Divinity and most recently Fable, I have never experienced anything even remotely as disappointing as this. If there was a rating lower than 1 star this game would deserve it!"
5,Ownage,"This is a great game. I didn't know about the initial release, but the collectors is great! Even with an uber old computer, it worked with some glitches. Wit a fast one, it will soon be the best game I've ever played. The race and heraldy stuff is cool. Heraldly will give you special bonuses to skills and other abilities. Combat is intense and more than a little bloody... watch out for the goblin by the beginning gate. Hes hard to beat, and has a surprise for u"
1,Not a REAL Ukrainian Cookbook,"Being Ukrainian, I got this cookbook with the expectation of seeing some new and interesting recipes I'd never seen before. Instead I found things I've NEVER heard of being called Ukrainian recipes. It was definitely not even worth the shipping cost, let alone the time I spent looking through it. I hope the next Ukrainian cookbook I get is better than this one."
1,It's a terrible book...,"... which is not worth your time and money. If you really want to get to know the authentic Ukrainian cuisine - try to find another source, because this one is about the author's fantasies but not the Ukrainian reality. I am Ukrainian, I love my country, I'm proud of my people's history and I'm deeply devoted to my people's traditions, including the cooking and cuisine. And I have NEVER encountered in my whole life any of the recipes in this book, even although I've been to almost every here-and-there of my beloved country.Besides, some of the translations of the dish titles are not into Ukrainian but into some crazy and awkward mix of Russian and Ukrainian - being a linguist, I'm very sensitive to the books which are written in an incorrect and falsifying manner...If I could rate this book with ""MINUS FIVE stars"", I would gladly do this."
1,Vegetarian lard?,"I didn't think there would be a lot of recipes I could use, but I like ethnic cookbooks and decided to check it out. I was pleased and surprised to see a few recipes labeled vegetarian. Then I looked at them. Dear publishers, it's a pretty firm rule that vegetarian and lard should never appear in the same recipe (Volyn-style vegetarian borsch)."
1,don't waste your time with this one.,"Excited to find the best of Ukrainian cuisine won't work with this book unless you're still on a farm in some other decade. Or you like cooking with lard, grinding meat, and of course removing organs and bones from pigs - oh, yum! The author's translations in the back of the book from English to Ukrainian for ordering meals are worth a laugh. However, I think he's serious. Pass this book up."
2,Unsure?!,"Had trouble cutting anything bigger than 22 gauge wire. Plus I had trouble with handles, they felt like they could break"
2,don't keep heat off hands,Gets quite warm while handling hot things... a bit scary. I would not recommend and have better products for the same price
4,Good Protection,I have used these oven mits for about a month and give great heat protection. You can't beat the price.
1,Feel the heat,Can feel the heat in these things if you hold something hot for longer than a few seconds. Would not recommend.
4,Love and Death on Long Island,"This was an excellent movie. John Hurt was very well cast in his role and he did a magnificent job. Maybe it would have been better with someone other than Jason Priestley, but then he is pretty much the clueless actor that the script called for."
3,Sweet coming-out story.,"Nice stuff that's not going to rock anybody's world but is a pleasant way to spend an evening. Hurt is, as usual, phenomenal, and Priestley is appropriately baffled and understanding as the young heterosexual (or is he?) sought after by the older man coming to grips with his own sexuality. There are no keen insights here, but nor are there clunky ones. It's just a sweet, smart, little film."
2,Very disappointing,"When I read the reviews of this movie on its release I was eager to see it. It sounded quirky & interesting, not the usual predictable product of a Hollywood factory. Unfortunately, this shallow film is more TV sitcom than anything else, with talking cars, supermarket shopping-basket confrontations, a goofy landlady & a bunch of phony pseudo-Cheers diner patrons. Nothing rings true on either an emotional or satirical level. I'm surprised it didn't show up as a Fox series. In particular I found John Hurt's performance disappointingly indifferent. See Ian McKellen in Gods and Monsters in a similar role & similar setup to appreciate what some dimensional acting might have wrought on this limp effort."
2,connection??,"At no time could I get a connection, between Hurt, and Priestly, long drawn-out dead-end streets. I left puzzled and a bit frustrated at all these people wandering around looking at each other as thru a glass darkley. sorry could not get anything out of this movie!! **"
1,Some good acting in a boring story,"In the beginning of the film it is very difficult to know what the story is all about. One needs to struggle to keep watching futrher. When the truth dawns, its is a disappointment. The Movie turns out to be a ""modern"", ""funny"" version of the classic ""Death in Venice"". As for the theme, it is handled with such care as if not to embarrass anyone too much with the underlining homosexuality. And as for humor: perhaps the jokes about British misconceptions about the Americans can feel funny to the average American. For most Europeans, I suspect it is all just yawns. Acting is partly great (John Hurt), but Jason Priestly could be substituted with a block of wood."
2,Tragic Editing of a Potentially Good Film,"This movie continuously appears to have potential, but it is never realized. Every innuendo is so undeveloped that you pray that another one isn't dropped on your lap. The effect is that the movie drags to a slow death. The ""big"" scene is banal and embarrasingly thin. One must conclude that there was a lot more footage but that it was edited out in an attenpt to keep the length tolerable. It wasn't."
3,"Too bad nobody saw it, it's a good movie","First, if you're looking to laugh your head off, this is NOT the film. This is a good, not great movie, thorougly worthwhile if you like good acting in movies. And John Hurt as Gile De'Ath provides the good acting. The film does have it's funny moments, but it is the screenplay, the words spoken by the actor(s) that make this film intriguing, at least for me. I also saw Gods & Monsters, and though both are good, this move is faster paced (yes, faster paced) and humorous. It's a shame it's been overlooked. Even Priestley proved that teen hearthrobs can appear (and act) in movies that aren't aiming for the pocketbook. I'd definitely recommend this one for those who believe good acting."
3,Decent,"These guys have loads of talent; their songwriting prowess hasn't been lost over the years (and through the personnel changes). Whoever wrote the first post and said that James Murphy is a better guitarist than Alex Skolnick ever was needs to get his head examined. Granted, Murphy does a good job carrying the torch, there just isnt' as much electricity in the music. I hate to say it, but Testament didn't get better until their music developed in a manner that allowed for songs be substantial without the need for a solo. And they've made it to that point (over the course of the past 2-3 years)."
5,Big Screen Bombshells,I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone. Some the films have former clients & friends in them and that makes it special.
3,Not That Great Movies Here,"I bought this mainly for the Jayne Mansfield movie and the Dorothy Stratten movie. All the other movies aren't really that good, and I probably won't watch it a second time. I won't recommend it, unless you just buy it for the Dorothy Stratten movie, which I think is considered a cult movie. Which is odd to find it collected here with a bunch of forgettables."
2,Really Awful,"Even taking the price and era in consideration, this wasn't worth the money. I got it for Galaxina but it's a TV version and the colors are strobed out and look hazey. The other films weren't worth mentioning. I gave each 30 mins before giving up.it was a risk. Didn't pay off."
3,better than expected,"12 movies. i was expecting expoitation for the most part. but was rather pleased for about half of these were rather good, some almost of a decent dramatic dramatic quality. as with most films, it is a matter of taste, what one likes another hates. for me, i would buy this again and feel that i got my money in value with even only half being good, a couple were even pretty darn good. jane mansfield put in a very credible performance, not one you would have thought was in her. a reference was made to her death, i googled and found she died in a lousianna car accident...sad, she may have well been a rather nice person different from the bimbo creation often shown."
5,Great video,This has a great group of movies. Movie Stars were great.You can not great this many movies at the price.
3,Amusing,A good collection of pictures starred by some of the most famous screen bombshells. I miss the presence of some others who are not included here.
3,A CIA whistleblower spins an incredible tale,"""Operation Pseudo Mirando: A Veteran of the CIA Drug Wars Tells All,"" by Kenneth C. Bucchi is a sensational book. To this end, the author is a CIA whistleblower who spins an incredible tale. If it were not for Gary Webb's fine book, ""Dark Alliance"" most mainstream readers would dismiss Bucchi outright. Moreover, the author is vain...with a vulger tough guy attitude that forces the reader to conclude that the author is a ""grandstander.""Still and all, the author definitely has an intimate knowledge of the war on drugs that cannot be found in the press. And his understanding of drug trafficking out of Colombia is convincing. Certainly, the CIA is covering up something. If you believe Bucchi...""Operation Pseudo Miranda"" was a revenue stream that enabled Iran - Contra.Bert Ruiz"
4,not about the miranda rights.,"this book is amazing, the detail that the author uses is incredible. it details special missions that resulted in lives lost and coke found. who would have thought the government was into such a nasty business. but honestly the book is great and if you like non-fiction then i suggest you pick this one up. it is truly a remarkable stepping stone to the truth of the clandestine acts of the CIA and the governments other agencies."
3,bible bit study,Great short study on friendships. Not DVD driven so you need visual tools. Great book
2,Not What It Says It Is,"This book was promoted as a cat behavior book. It has some interesting information about cat physiology, but the information on behavioral issues, such as scratching, not using the litter box, and so on, is really sketchy. I sent it back because the author is strongly in favor of outdoor access for cats but he never once mentions the potential dangers of life outdoors. He suggests that indoor-only cats are neurotic and unhealthy. But he says nothing at all about FIV or Feline Leukemia, nothing about dogs, mean people, cars, antifreeze, or any of the other dangers that you should consider before making the decision on whether to keep your cat indoors or not. My husband and I each lost great cats to FIV because we didn't know that we were putting them at risk by letting them out. I think it's irresponsible of Roger Tabor not to acknowledge the possible dangers of outdoor life."
5,One of the best worship CD's EVER!,"This is one of those rare recordings in which every single song is incredible! It's a perfect resource for any worship pastor or programming director. I ordered this from Amazon because my original copy got passed around so much, it finally decided to stay away for good. I am giving this copy as a gift to my worship pastor - he's always looking for new material and I have done nothing but rave about this CD for months! He'll finally be able to hear what I've been talking about."
2,This is card running at 24X speed.,"I purchased this card from the market seller ""emartbuy"". This card in not running at 150X speed. It's write speed is close to 3.6MB/sec(24X). Don't buy it from emartbuy if you really want a 150X card. The card is okay to buy if you don't mind the write speed(24X)."
2,cheap,Fairly poor quality. Outer cases fell off several of my cards and the units stopped functioning within a few months.
1,unreliable,"Hey, its fast alright. But, when I used it, I lost several hundred files due to bad sectors. Buy yourself a name brand model."
2,"2GB Secure ""Dingital""","I ordered a quantity of 3, 2GB Secure Digital memory cards. They seamed to be an incredible deal at around $18 each so I ordered a few.When I received them, they were labeled ""Secure DiNgital"", which led me to believe they were some sort of ""second quality"" or ""knock off"" merchandise. One of them works fine in my PDA Smart phone however, another one doesn't work well at all in my SD camcorder. I filmed my sons first T-Ball game the other day but when I went to watch it, the camcorder read ""SD Card Error"" & prompted to ""format"" the card & lose all data.So, I have a mixed review of the items. it is a good value for the storage size but only if it works effectively.So, I guess you DO get what you pay for."
3,James Madison #4,"I labored over this book as it reads like a textbook. Ketcham focuses of minutiae for the great part of the book and quotes documents that truly aren't relevant to the man. I felt that he breezed over Madison's impact on the Constitution and focused on less important endeavors of the man's life. It seems that the section covering his terms as president and vice-president were only a fraction of the book compared to his work in the continental congress. Ketcham had the opportunity to make a very important part of history enjoyable, but turned it into a boring read. The beginning and end of the book were great, but this is a book I imagine to be on the bookshelf in Hell's reading room."
3,The academic's Madison,"If you are searching for a light or relaxing biography of Madison, this will not be the measured choice. This is a difficult and sometimes plodding read, so be forewarned. The excuse that Ketcham is an ""academic historian"" and therefore is allowed to be boring is indeed a stretch, Stephen Ambrose writes beautifully and is an academic historian as well.This is a trustworthy, sober and lengthy treatment of Madison, written by a man who knows his subject intimately. The reader can trust the facts between the covers, but there is an integral element missing: Madison himself. There are innumerable anecdotes and descriptions of Madison, but it's buried within the minutiae and sheer length of this very heavy tome. I never got a sense of Madison as a human being, only as a political or revolutionary shadow.Recommended only for those either obsessed with Madison or tolerant of a chilly and plodding read."
3,"The subject is captivating, but the writing is not.","James Madison lived a fascinating life - he provides an endless number of amazing stories. Unfortunately, this book destroys the flow of these stories by tossing in every person that Madison encountered - and even some that he may not have (in which case the author says, ""and doubtless, Madison would have spoken with...""). The great story of Madison's life gets lost in the clutter at times. If nothing else, this book spurned me on to read a couple more books about Madison."
1,Great subject poorly handled,"This book is terrible. Madison was a giant yet this book captures little of that. It is poorly written, poorly conceived, and ahistorical to boot. The author knows little of history, speculates too often, and is a terrible writer. Madison deserves much better."
4,"James Madison: ""A biography"".",The book about James Madison is important when it comes to get to know how the politics and the creation of the USA became a reality. Beside - there is a lot of wisdom and good learning about how to become a good democrat in this reading.
4,"A good, detailed bio.","While it has been several years since I have read this book, I would still rate it the best bio of Madison available, especially since it is about the only one available. It is true that it can be a tough read at times; certainly not as breezy as some of the latest bios are, but compared to the ones I have read published by the American Political Biography Press this one is a picnic. Like others writing reviews here, I am attempting to read bios on all the U. S. Presidents. This is about the only one I have seen on Madison and would for that reason alone recommend it."
4,Very thorough.,"This is a very thorough, very detailed biography of James Madison. Its tone gets a bit dry at times, its writing style a bit ponderous, and the attempt to make up for a lack of hard facts regarding the details of Madison's early years by speculating (""we can imagine Madison looking out of his window at these sights and thinking..."") was a bit distracting, but understandable. But overall, the book is highly recommended for anyone with the attention span necessary to read history."
3,Not the greatest literature...but positive fun!,"I enjoyed this book as did my Ethiopian son for the very reasons that a previous reveiwer didn't. It presented Ethiopia as a pleasant, appealing place, not some awful ""over there."" Most countries have their horrific sides but it's nice to have the opportunity to view the positive. It was a doubly pleasant experience for my son to have friends say ""that's cool"" rather than to hear ""starving Ethiopian"" jokes. Most experiences I have had with Ethiopia, the people have been kind and gracious, the country beautiful with a deep, rich history. Yes, it is a third world country, but poverty doesn't diminish the people, the wildlife, the food, the history, the culture...all of the things mentioned in the book ""One of a Kind."""
1,Disappointing,"This book is difficult to follow because it is written in the format of an academic student's report. Little background knowledge is given, so a person unfamiliar with Chinese politics could easily get lost. I felt more like I was reading a high school report put together primarily for the benefit of the author.Unless you are very familiar with the Communist Party of China's organization, this book is not very good to start out with if you are interested in learning about China's new economy."
5,Another Amazing CD from Cindy,Cindy Morgan has created another amazing album. This album may be her best yet. Cindy has created an album which has a fun fresh sound which remins one of Christ's great love and the amazing world that he has created for us to enjoy.
1,Disappointment from Santa,"After three frustrating days, my son and I were only able to build two leg sections of the ""robot"". The instructions are ""3-D"" pictures that are very confusing. The unfinished kit has remained untouched for the past three months. What a waste of $120! I challenge the company that makes this overpriced pile of plastic to find a child (for ages 7+) who could even begin to put it together. Solving a Rubik's cube with a blindfold on would be easier than building this toy. Unless you really enjoy doing 900 piece 3-D puzzles, do NOT buy this product."
1,Simple and Stylish but painful,"This really hurts my shoulders and my baby doesn't like it. She gets fussy and cries when I try to put her into a cradle position and gets tired fast if I hip-carry her. The main thing is that after 10 minutes of carrying her (my baby's just 15#s), my shoulder hurts so much that I can't use the sling anymore."
1,Strangely crafted,"with all due respect, this toy has limited articulation, the sword broke and the noxious paint fumes linger for days."
2,Really nice features but...,I received this defective. The face plate would not move back up after it moves down so I could put in a CD. I called Sony and they are willing to replace it with a brand new one BUT I would have to pay for this shipping...It will take another 3 weeks for me to get my deck now.
3,Not What I Was Hoping For,Arrived on time in described condition but was not the book I was hoping for. I would have liked this to be be more relevant and timeless in terms of digital graphics core design principals.
2,Sound quality is sub-par,"I purchased this cd because I had been introduced to the Bluetones thru the Scott Pilgrim vs the World Soundtrack. I feel like Sleazy Bed Track is one of the finest songs ever made period. I looked forward to hearing more of the Bluetones work, but unfortunately this cd is a poor representation of their music. For some reason, the instrumentals completely drown out the lead singer throughout the entire cd. I'm assuming it's due to the way it was recorded and I enjoy ""un-plugged"" style sessions, but I don't know how anyone could enjoy a song when the lyrics are inaudible."
1,Very little information about Viagra!,"The book, in my opinion, is really mis-titled as the bulk of the book is about male erectile dysfunction, and very secondarily about Viagra. I bought the book as I thought I was getting an indeep review of Viagra and its effects. It appears that the book was written too early in the Viagra introduction cycle, it was copywrited in 1998, to have much practical information to include in the book. In summary I found the book disappointing and certainly would not recommend it."
4,"Great Book, Well Written, Fun For exploring/discussion","This is a really well done idea - each turn of the page reveals different parts of a T-rEX - musculatory, skeleton, digestive, skin, etc. in 3D and in color. And yes, it is very speculative due to what we do know about dinosaurs. Plus, each page has fascinating facts about dinos and their biology. Just keep in mind for inquisitive hands that the pieces cannot be removed from the book - they are not made to be assembled separately but only for show within the pages.I would rate this a 5 star but for two detractions: a) the books in this series ges dented and marked very easily on the outside corners (looks worn and well used after a few days) and b) the T-Rex parts in 3D are very cheap and thin plastic that almost feel like they'd break if you breathed on them."
5,Best album in a while.,"I actually got this CD the day it came out, but I never reviewed it. I saw that some obviously braindead ppl called this album wack. This is a gr8 album. I would actually give it a 4/5, but u can't score it that. On song's like ""For those Who Don't Know"", and ""What's Wrong With This Picture?"", he showcases his talents. This is a must-have for Hiero fans and hip hop fans alike. Ope really has a lot 2 say, and is a good producer as well.High Points: ""For Those Who Don't Know"", ""What's Wrong With This Picture?"", ""Viva Main Vein!!!"", and ""Granite Earth"".Low Points: ""Dream...But Don't Sleep"" is merely OK."
5,TIGHT!!!,"Let me first say to the group of hip hop listeners that are only concerned about getting crunk or ice-shinin' cuts this album is not for you. This album is for the true hiphop heads! I can't say enough about this Tri-Station cd. I love it, I haven't stop listening to since I bought it. I personaly can listen to this cd straight through I can't say that for most of the hiphop out today. I was kind of sceptacle when I saw Opio produced most of the tracks but to my surprise he can make some beats, different but tight! If you like Hiro then this is a must have album. His flow was definetly stong on this album and must say he put out a great solo effort."
3,how does the box work with a card or just so,i bought this box and it came without controls and all other accessories even though it was bought used i think your suppose to be giveen the controls if anything so sofar iam not pleased with deal or no deal
1,"Nice features, buggy/flakey device","The basic features of the device are nice, WHEN THEY ARE WORKING. Sadly, they don't work as expected very well or very often. Dish seems to have done a pretty poor job in engineering this as many customers have a lot of problems when the features don't work as expected. Do some searching on the internet on ""VIP622 problems"" to see for yourself. Device reboots randomly, loses satelite signals on a clear day even though signal strength shows as strong, all DVRs recording mysteriously disappear from time to time, and everytime they update new software for the device brings new headaches."
1,No response,"Purchased on the 4th from new marketplace seller. Had some questions so I sent two emails requesting information and verification. NO reply. This was supposed to ship on the 5th or 6th. It's the 7th. Still no reply and it's not shipped yet.No, nothing, nada, zilch.Now I'm worried."
1,failed technology,"I have owned this receiver for a while now and I just realized how many others are fed up with these poorly built, poorly designed, totally unsupported rip offs. It acts as though there is no sattelite signal. If I reboot, ie.. turn off at main control, multiple times it will eventually magically find all the signals at the normal strong reading. It is then good for a number of hours and then it stops. tough luck if you actually are paying for dvr service because the odds of it working during your program are zilch. I would switch to dtv but those yahoos sound as bad or worse than dish. thank god for netflix which doesnt require any of this proprietary equipment to enjoy. this crap is just supposed to work. what is the problem dish? this is about the 4th receiver i have bought on the open market, promotions dont exist in alaska where i live. so i have one more $550.00 paperweight that goes into the garage. what bs."
2,Works well as a room heater too!,"I have been using this DVR for a few years now. It works well with a few conditions.First and foremost, keep it cool and make sure it is ventilated well wherever it is installed.Second, this thing is noisy when it goes into the update mode. 3am is the default time for the nightly updates. You may set it differently to avoid the air raid siren waking you up from a restful sleep.The DVR function has performed perfectly.I just wish this thing had more than 35 hours of HD storage. I use an external Hard Drive to expand it's storage."
1,This Thing is Garbage!!!,"I am always cynical when I see someone brutally slam an item, but the ViP622 is absolute garbage. It is a shame that Amazon won't allow you rate items with negative numbers because this product doesn't even rate one star. The box is very buggy and subject to crashing. The HDMI went out 2 weeks after hooking it up. Dish said that it was a known software problem and that they were developing a fix that would be out in a couple of weeks. That was 5 months ago and still counting. Even worse is the fact that they won't replace it because they claim that it is a software problem that affects all 622's. They couldn't explain why it worked fine and then all of the sudden stopped. They will also try and tell you that you have a bad cable or that the problem is with your TV. If you Google ""ViP622 HDMI Problems"" You will get 100's of pages of references to the problems that people are having with this box. Stay away!!!"
1,Dish Network? Buyer beware!,"Learn from my experience. Dish Network provided the best television picture I have ever seen. The channel selection is terrific. Their dual TV receiver is a wonderful product. If anything goes wrong, however, don't plan to ever get it fixed. This is their Achilles' heel. You will be put through a never-ending gauntlet of irrelevant questions, delay tactics and stumbling blocks. There will be a transparent and desperate attempt to prove that the problem is not theirs. In the event they deign to favor you with a service call, expect to wait a month and expect to pay for it. Apparently, if the dish they installed is not aimed correctly, it is your problem, not theirs. If the receiver goes on the fritz, well, no TV for you. I was a top-of-the-line, premium HD service customer and this is how I was treated."
1,VIP 622 Let Me Down,"I thought this was a great HD receiver for the last year. Until this week, when it started shutting itself off and trying to re-boot for many minutes. Apparently this is a common issue, and its SOOOOOO annoying. I've lost at least three shows that I really enjoy and will probalby loose everything I've recorded for the last several months.Dish needs to fix this or move on to something that is more reliable.IMOHO."
5,Great HD DVR,"I had HD receivers since 1998 and this is one of the best units I ever had. It does everything.. Records in HD while watching another HD program. Set timer for favorite HD programming. Stop live TV anytime and resume at your own pace ! Picture in Picture feature works great. Also can be used on two separate TV and to different programs. HDMI works great on my Sony 7.1 surround sound system. Once you run out of storage space , simply call dish network and purchase an external hard drive for this great receiver. Great quality unit! LOVE THIS RECEIVER 10+++++++++++++++++++"
4,healthy and helpful,"Flaxseed oil is so beneficial for joint and overall health. The bottle has a no-spill cap which is helpful if you ever drop it. The one draw-back to the no-spill cap is that you have to squeeze the bottle very hard just to get the oil out. However, if that becomes a problem, you can just unscrew the cap and pour the oil out. Great product with helpful packaging!"
3,"Good Quality, Not-So-Great Taste","Like the price. But didn't notice in the product description that this oil is preserved with tocopherols (vitamin e). Like one of the other reviewers, I found the taste medicinal. I've switched back to Barlean's. However I do continue to order this oil as a supplement for my dogs. The price and quality is just right for that purpose."
1,Bitter Taste,All 3 bottles of flaxseed oil were bitter. I returned them for a refund. I have been drinking flax seed oil for a few years now and this was the worst tasting.
3,Drawer extension slides,I was going to order some slides but got confused by the fact the detail info only indicated one slide.. I have purchased alot of drawers slides over the years but they were always sold in pairs...Amazon told me to contact the mfr.. waterloo..
3,Sweet Liberty,"The movie was cheap, dry and down right boring to the point that I fell asleep in the middle of it and didn't wake up until the credits were over. After watching it again I stayed away through it but don't know why I did..."
2,"Idea is worthy, but movie goes nowhere",Overblown comedy about movie studio arriving in a small town to shoot a film there based on the local university professor's book on the American Revolution. A terrific cast tries their best with the flat and predictable script. Just plain unfunny.
1,Hawkeye Writes a Historical Book,"Never once did I see Alda playing this college professor in a small North Carolina town. I saw Alda playing his MASH character for 2 hours. Shows how much Alda loved his tv character that he resurrects everything about Hawkeye for this one. The humor, the irreverence at the film's battle scene conclusion, the womanizing. Surprised not to see Harry Morgan make a cameo appearance but then he was probably sitting in jail after beating up his wife and couldn't make it. Another reviewer here mentioned how terrible the music was and I just laughed. Although released in 1986, the music reminds me of the post disco era circa 1980 and really dates the film with its techno pop keyboard work and closing credit vocal. Just terrible! If you are going to watch this one, I recommend turning down the sound when the credits roll at the end."
2,=Ernest P. Worrel for grown-ups,"There is an inescapable air of self-indulgence throughout this film, and it stifles any potential the novel but inevitable premise held. Alda's relation to each character screams for pity and fails to make the viewer care unless by some unfortunate taste one finds him and his misadventures somehow attractive. This is a high jinx film with a history buff's gloss, a formula for contrived disaster and TV movie tripe. The rousing climax of the filmed reenactment is corny and chaotic, calling either for an unaffordable budget (from wasting good actors) or a span that could not be controlled. If the angle of book-to-film frustration is to work, the sideplots must be altogether ignored. The humor and general plot is unbearably innocent, requiring a naive audience not easily found. I found it used for $1, and flea-market bartering could probably put anyone else well within that range."
5,The Emotional Brain,"Received item as described, fast delivery, will purchase from vendor againthank youM Haynes"
4,used book,"the book contains some penciled write ins.pages are in good shape.soft cover in good shape.the penciled in notations are a little distracting,otherwise a good book."
2,It's not Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman,"This book is attempting to ride on the coattails of Daniel Goleman's best-seller Emotional Intelligence (Emotional Intelligence is Copyright 1995; Emotional Brain is Copyright 1996). I didn't find Ledoux's book to be very useful and I don't believe that many other non-specialists will either. In fact, Ledoux's book (Emotional Brain) discusses how emotions are physically generated in the brain; while Goleman's (Emotional Intelligence) is the book that brought the EQ/IQ debate to the public's attention. It must be noted that Goleman does give credit to Ledoux in Emotional Intelligence for a diagram showing the Thalamus, Amygdala, and Visual Cortex. So if you're looking at this book because you want to know more about the EQ/IQ debate, definitely look at Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman first."
2,Bad book,"It is not customary for me to feel so moved by a book that I want to write a review. This book is so bad, so disappointing that someone really should say something.LeDoux waits until the very last chapter to admit: ""I've passed the emotional consciousness buck. I've redefined the problem ...as how emotional information comes to be represented in working memory. This won't make you happy if you want to know exactly what a feeling is or if you want to know how something as intangible as a feeling could be part of something so tangible as a brain.""Duh! That's why I bought the book! After all, the subtitle is ""The mysterious Underpinnings of Emotional Life.""What the writer does manage to do prior to his final chapter is report the history of brain research, which is useful primarily as a sleep aid. The final chapter is however interesting and worth reading. If we could remove the first eight chapters, I could recommend this book."
2,Disappointed,"This is a decent pool game and runs well on XP. While I have some minor complaints (for example, you cannot set the sound volume, only on or off) I certainly can live with them.However, there is a option setting for 'Full Screen' which, at least on my machine, cannot be switched. The game always runs in full screen mode. I emailed On Hand Software twice about this but have not received a reply. Nice way to treat their customers, right? Unless you find this in the clearance bin, I would avoid it."
1,donde esta la vida,i believe francisco cespedes to be the frank sinatra of cuban singers. what a soulful and inspiring album. this guy is destined to be a major star. highly recommended.
4,GREAT PERFORMANCE AND RECORDINGFROM PANCHO CESPEDES,"A SUCCES FOR FRANCISCO, A MUST FOR HIS FANS GREAT PERFORMANCES, ARRANGEMENTS, AND LYRICS, A MUST HAVE FOR FRANCISCO'S FANS."
5,Know Before You Go,"The Rainier dvd gets your heart pumping!This dvd offers you the opportunity to fully visualize and understand what is to be expected from you on the mountain.With narration from the knowledgeable climber and expedition leader Eric Simonson, you learn the reality.This interactive climbing dvd will complement any Mt. Rainier guide book and will when viewed, set you aside from those on the mountain with just a general idea and a vague picture of where they are heading.As a climber myself, one thing I love as much as the views and the many experiences is to be able to keep climbing.Know Before You Go!~009"
5,Non-climbers point of view,"This has to be the best video and informational DVD on climbing MT. Rainier. I have lived in the Pacific Northwest all my life,and have never had a desire to climb Mt. Rainier. After seeing the DVD,I KNOW I will never climb it. But I often wondered what it was like,and what was up there ,now I know. It is beautiful. I have watched it over and over and still find new things everytime I veiw it. Thank you Ascend team for putting out such a fine product. Now I can climb Mt.Rainier from my easy chair whenever I want."
3,good 3.5 stars,"I think it is a good dvd - I wish the was a bit more on the routes and a little on glaicer rescue - but all in all I think it describes the routes pretty good for a basic intro - if your relying on a soley a dvd to get you up rainier the your not too smart. get this for an intro and then really do your resarch on your route thru books, trip reports, etc...climbing rangers."
3,Wake Up and Think,"My name is Matt. I am an education major planning to graduate and enter the field in 2003. I read Awakening Young Minds to better prepare for a class presentation. My first impression of the book before I began my journay throung it was at it would be a book based upon awakening the young minds of students. It is in a sense,how to do just that, however, it is more centered around awaking the minds of teachers. This book is packed with tons of interesting insights, thoughts, and questions about educating that will really force one to open their mind and think. It suggests many different approaches to teaching such as game playing and not so much filling students minds with facts but challenging the students to think with critial questions! I would not recomened this book to everyone. Only the select few who posses a love and passion for teaching. For those, I would highly recomened this book of profound insights and philosophies into teaching."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BAG... unless you want a dead laptop,"Here's the problem with this bag (and I am sorry to say that I learned this from bitter experience!) The shoulder strap is affixed to the edges of the bag by spring loaded clips. A certain twist to the shoulder strap will cause the strap to disengage, which will in turn cause your laptop to crash to the ground. I ruined my nearly new, $3000 powerbook like this.If you already have one of these bags and haven't experienced this, get some cable ties and loop them through each side. Double them up, you won't regret it."
5,"Original, Memorable, and Useful","Bronstein is one of the best chess writers/instructors ever, and this is one of the best chess books! I find the reviewers who thought the games didn't illustrate his points, that it is difficult to read, and the book as a whole is not instuctive--incomprehensible.The text is a joy to read (by chess book standards), the games illustrate key points in memorable, often startling ways, and his explanation of conducting a game in stages marching foward rank by rank and invadind with pieces through pawn structure quite unique, logical, and simple.This book, along with a book on tactics and endings, would get a player far indeed if s/he puts in the hard work chess demands."
3,"""Just Plain Fancy,"" a fanciful tale about Mennonites.","Polacco's engaging pictures and charming story do delight children. Teachers might, however, expand use of this story to point out the differences between fiction and fact. To Mennonites, an anabaptist Pennsylvania German group, headcoverings have religious significance. They are not 'rewards' as indicated in 'Just Plain Fancy.' Readers should be cautioned that this is a 'fanciful' tale."
5,You're the best Jeannie !,"Been looking for this CD ! Have followed Jeannie since the early 60's...and she is truly great ! Does anyone know where she might be performing now ? Especially when she might be back in the Portland, Oregon area ? Would love to see her in person one more time !!"
5,"Awesome Christian Rock from ""back in the day""","This is an awesome album. The guitar choreography is absolutely awesome!!! This rivals any secular hair band from back in the day... It has the music, it has the feel, and MOST IMPORTANTLY it has a positive message!!!"
5,Bags were a great price,Bags fit in my Riccar and seem to function as they are suppose too. No complaints or problems with the bags.
1,Much ado about nothing.,"David Victor presents an interesting story with one major omission which tends to disqualify the book completely.Blithely assuming that emissions controls can reverse a modest climate change without as much as an attempt to understand the nature of the present climate trend, especially in a perspective giving at least some comprehension of why climate change constantly occurs, the book cooks up a lot or reasoning about nothing.The cart is solidly before the horse and I suggest other transportation for those interested in the Kyoto conundrum."
5,The best Lego thing ever!,"This is the best Lego thing ever! Before I saw this, I thought that Legos were just blocks of plastic that you put together, then take down. I was wrong! This is so much fun ( the best part is messing up the characters.). It was a lot smaller than I imagined when it got put together, but it is good because if you have other Legos, you can sort of add parts to it (so far I have made a house for Ron, a bed for Hermione, and a chair for Harry.). The only thing is that when you have made the table and chairs and you make your characters sit down, it is really hard to pick them back up without picking up the chairs and part of the floor too!"
4,Comes apart easily,"As with all large Lego projects, this one is difficult to put together. The kids love Harry Potter, and like the idea of having this castle. The only problem I have had with these sets is that once assembled, you can't really ""play"" with them. They come easily apart, and the thought of re-assembling them is so discouraging! If there were a Hogwarts castle that wasn't comprised of Legos, I would have much preferred that. Seeing how there is not, this is the only game in town."
3,"Pieces missing, but service helpful.","My husband and I purchased this item for our son as his gift from Santa this year. Imagine our disappointment when the set was missing 22 pieces, (which we didn't discover, of course, until we started assembling it)... Our son handled the story that santa and the elves had a rough year ok, but it has been very hard on him waiting for the replacement pieces to come so we can finish building his castle. It was all he wanted and we were not happy to dispapoint him.On a good note, customer assistance DID order replacement parts, once my husband was able to get someone on the line and keep them there. So all's well that ends well, I guess. Legos' are legendary... all kids love them... and so it should be.Sincerely, Ricky Kelly"
4,"That's not just good, its brilliant","Okay, there is another Hogwarts Castle available. however, with its price being nearly $500. I think this smaller version is just as fantastic! My son likes to pretend he is Harry or Ron on one of their wild adventures thru. the castle. He also likes the fact you can divide the castle into sections and carry one peice at a time. I recommend this Lego if you like Harry and his friends as much as we do.My only concern would be to be very careful, as any with any Lego, the castle can come apart if played with too rough."
5,The Lego Hogwarts Castle,"It took my kid and I 4 fun days to put it all together. From then on, it's her own exclusive source of fun - she plays with it daily, re-enacting scenes from the book, making new ones. A few minor parts cape off during play with another kid - the fire in the fireplace where Sirius showed up.I wish Lego would sell separately a few other characters (Sirius,Bellatrix, Ginny, Lupin and especially Fred and George, Dobby etc).But I had always been a Lego fan, and I am more so after getting this."
5,Bitter-sweet pleasure,"I've re-read this book nearly , what, a 100 times? why? Guy Bellamy is maybe the only author I know that can make you laugh out loud at the desparately sorry state some people find themselves in. A beautifully weaved (and funny ... did i say funny? YES) plot containig a very palatable sideways repost to the radically feminist world. Loved it.... (Loved A Village called Sin even more) Your friends will want to steal it!!"
5,Superb!,"I agree with the first reviewer. I have read this book scores of times and still re-read it. Excellent characters and some brilliant one-liners. Also, an excellent look at feminism in a pro-male way (where else can you find that! ).If you can get a copy then do."
1,Predictabilty is predictable.,"This book was trash. Absoloute trash. I.E. no redeeming value. Sure, Nick is funny as a character, but that doens't save this book. The characters are shallow, vain, and, frankly, pathetic. Bellamy kills off the three year old to try to add tragic drama, but as a plot device it suffers terribly - mostly becuase we haven't seen much of the kid in the book, and so we really don't care about him. This book was sad trash - not reccomeneded."
2,Waste of money...,"This product is a waste of money. The package says to allow EIGHT weeks for it to work!! The whole thing doesn't last that long. It lasted me about six weeks. You see some results but it feels like you're being inflated and then if you don't take it even for a few days you deflate. Don't waste you money with this stuff, just invest in some good creatine and protein and your pump will last longer and you'll gain more mass."
3,The death of a documentary,"This movie was originally much different than it turned out to be, that is, as seen in this DVD version. The first version was too balanced, too even-handed, and audiences came away thinking that maybe Fred Leuchter was right. Director Morris then made dramatic alterations to cast Leuchter -- and by extension, his ideas -- in a bad light. Reading the other reviews of this DVD, you can see that Morris' smear attempt was only partially successful."
4,Mr. Death: He had alot of guts...,"... to publish ""The Leuchter Report"". I've read it (available on the internet) and he also looked at the ""gas chambers"" from a mechanical standpoint, to see if they ""could"" of been used... no proper seals (the gas would of leaked out), no heat in the buildings to supliment the gas, no vents to introduce or take out the gas. In other words, those buildings shown to tourists were fakes. Notice on the film that nobody can dispute these findings, but only attack him personally. That says it all.Great film!"
3,solid movie,I really enjoyed some parts of this movie. I thought it was interesting and definitely worth watching. I felt a lot of sympathy for Fred because in my opinion he had good intentions but a lack of expertise. I thought the movie touched on some touchy topics but that made it more interesting to me. I also liked how different views were presented (extreme right and extreme left). I would have given the movie a better ranking but I thought that it should have been longer and given me more information. After the movie I had many questions still unanswered. I also thought the DVD should have given a better menu such as an interview with the director. Buy this movie if you like documentaries but be prepared to search the net for more information. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie in any case.
4,Steve Khan's tasteful Latin jazz,"Known sometime back for his inspired forays into jazz fusion, Steve Khan of late has turned to Latin jazz and done a terrific job. Now part of the multi-talented Caribbean Jazz Project, on this album he pares down his group setting to himself, Rob Mounsey on keyboards and the terrific Marc Quinones on Latin percussion.The CD includes three radio edits of some of the longer tracks--which include one tune by Manolo Badrena of the late great Weather Report. The songwriting is smart and tasteful, a great listening album for those who enjoy well-done American ventures into the flavors of Latin jazz. While Paquito Rivera's sax and Dave Samuels' vibes--both of Caribbean Jazz Project--are not in evidence, the sparser instrumentation here gives the three musicians more room to stretch out and develop the tunes' intricacies.Highly recommended."
1,audio goes very low on wireless hand set,"I talk on the wireless handset and sometimes, the audio goes so low that I can not hear the caller! Uniden tells me to change electric outlets, change main phone jack, keep away from electronics equipment, make sure that my LinkSys 2.4 GHz wireless router is not the same frequency as the Uniden 5.8 GHz handset (duh?), etc.I tried everything...this is a nice phone when it works, but overall it is VERY UNRELIABLE. I definitely do NOT recommend."
3,speakerphone not great,"I love this phone, but the speakerphone doesn't get very good sound and I end up not being able to use it."
2,"Sounds good on my end, but....","I used to do all my calling on a cell phone. I got a ground line after I moved to a neighborhood with crappy cellular reception. I bought this Uniden model at Target, along with one accessory handset. Incoming audio sounds fine on both. But people regularly complain that they can't understand me on the other end.I have a wireless router nearby which may be interfering with the phone. I'm not going to get rid of Wifi in my house. DECT 6.0 systems are supposed to not suffer much interference from Wifi, so hopefully a new DECT 6.0 phone will solve my problems. Otherwise, I'll just have to use a corded phone.It's sad that before cell phones I used to get excellent call quality with 900 MHz cordless phones. Now I have 6 times the Hz but the call quality drives folks crazy."
2,Not satisfied,This product doesn't work well with a Panasonic PABX and the range is not what it was supposed to be.Too much noise in the line during phone calls
4,"Good part, slightly different","Shipped within the week (3 days), and fits perfectly on the car! The item was slightly different in that the two cylindrical ""loops"" that line the top of the cover are replaced by a ""lip"" that lines the entire length of the top. Also, I'm not sure if it's actually LeBra, because there was no LeBra branding anywhere on the packaging or the cover itself, but the instructions recommend LeBra care products to clean it. Overall, I'm happy with it"
4,Great Value,"Replaced a 15 year old tube TV with the Phillips. I made my decision subsequent to a road trip or two to nearby stores because I don't believe you can make a subjective decision on picture quality based only on written reviews. I looked at the major brands side by side and liked the Phillips picture. Excellent quality per my tastes.Easy to set up wiring. Also like the Philips method that guides you through color, tint, brightness and contrast adjustments by going through a series of side by side on screen pictures and asking you to pick the one that most appeals to you. Much nicer than making tint or color adjustments via separate controls.Overall, I am very satisfied with this TV. One minor con would be the lack of swivel capability on the base."
1,"Great picture, but...","Our Philips was purchased in 2006. Everything was wonderful about it until the day it died in July, 2010. The power light turns on, but the screen remains black and you can't hear the power spin up. Based on other complaints found via Google and confirmed by the repairman who came by, there appears to be a recurring problem with an inverter board on Phillips TVs. Our repair guy gave us a $500 quote to replace that component. He suggested we buy a new TV because these televisions are also highly prone to have a power supply failure within 4-6 years, which would set us back another $500 within the next year or two. His comment that stuck with me was, ""these aren't your daddy's philips tv's. They are chinese-made and they slap a quality American brand on them, but they just ain't what they used to be.""Take that for what its worth, but I will never be buying a Philips brand appliance again."
3,Remote sensor dies just after the warranty period,If you buy this product get ready for a damaged remote sensor soon. and you will have to pay more for repair. Other wise have a good walk from the couch to tv to mute/unmute sound..........I think I will go for other brand for any electronic product i buy in the future definitely NOT this brand
3,nice tv but dies after 2 years,"This TV is pretty good i never had a prob w it and i baby the tv too, but suddenly one day it decides to blow and i get no picture now...ive only had it for 2 years and i never touch the tv unless its to clean it, but i guess im not the only person to have this prob w philips. alot of people have reported something going wrong w it w/in the 2years. so i ended up just buying a sony and loving it so far."
1,Dump your money in garbage,"My friend told me never buy any electronics from Philips but I decided to trust this giant brand. After I got this TV, the nightmare began. First, the DVI audio input not function properly. Second, I really doubt this is a 1080p HDTV. The resolution was so horrible after I connect my computer to HDMI input on TV. Third, the color looks weird on red. It is even worse than my old Panasonic 720p TV. After couple hours adjustments, I had no choice but returned this TV. Right now, I feel such a fool not listening to my friend. Anyway, it is totally wasting of time and money."
2,Display quit after being installed for 2 days,"I bought this display for 200 dollars less at a local wharehouse. I ordered a hdmi to dvi cable so i could hook the tv to my computer. This was the first chance to use 1080p. Played a movie for about an hour then screen went black. Will be returning for a replacement. For the two days i had the tv it was beautiful, couldnt have been more impressed quality was fantastic. Hopefully next one will work for more than two days."
2,Good looking TV - but has bugs.,"Ordered it from Amazon on 27 July 07. Excited when it came in less than a week delivered right to my door. Horray for Amazon! It is a beautiful set, but has significant problems: For one, it has issues acquiring the cable signal and often takes over 10 minutes to find it when turned on. Called the Philips hotline (they answered immediately!) and was told it was a satellite issue, not a TV problem. Funny, since my last TV didn't have any problems receiving the signal. Very, VERY frustrating.Second problem: I tried to connect my digital camera to the USB and the TV said it was an ""unsupportable device"". Wow! If a common Canon Elph digital camera is not supported by this TV, then few devices must be. (In fact, the manual says that only USB 1.1 are compatible). The Philips tech people said I should download the pictures onto a memory stick to view them. Odd and unnecessarily frustrating.So, based on my early experience, there are better HDTVs out there."
3,"A lot of space, limited functionality","The card is a good one due to the large amount of space. For the price, it's really hard to beat. The downside though is that the card will not play in my pc. I bought it for my pda, but wanted the ease of being able to transfer data to my pc without cables or anything else. Found out that I couldn't do it, but am still happy with the purchase. Just be wary of the device your buying it for and have an alternate way of getting the data back to your lap/desktop."
3,It's so so,It saves plenty of photos and music to my phone but when I try to but the mini in the adapter to put in my laptop it doesn't work and is locked no matter what I set the tab too.
1,Unreliable,"I got two of these through Amazon. One works most of the time, the other one does not. I have the more expensive SanDisk 4G card that works flawlessly in both my computer and in my Nuvi.What is odd is that the SD card that I received says ""SecureDingital Card"". It just surprises me that the stick on label on the card would misspell Digital and not use the standard SD logo. This product came from eek Technology."
1,A Blackmarket Product,"The product did not have any ""NAME BRAND"" and came in a unbranded bubble wrap envelope. Also the shipping cost more than the product,but I did recieve a 75% credit back to my account."
1,Don't buy one of these,"Bought for a Sanyo Xacti HD1A as a second card... already have a Transcend 4GB card in there that works fine.This one will not format, camera hangs up and I have to remove battery to reset it. It appears to format on the computer but only shows 1.89GB and still does the same in the camera.These might work with some cameras, etc. but not with this one which supports even larger capacity cards.I'm probably stuck with it since return shipping would eat up much of the cost...Junk"
1,No point,I was mistaken when I thought that this product would work with my pda. It not only caused my ppc 6700 to crash but it jacked up my laptop as well. I thought of doing an exchange only to get an email alluding to products getting returned back all the time so I declined. There is no point on getting a refund because there are so many fees I'd probably only get four dollars back. I should have known when the shipping was nearly that of the cost of the mini sd card. I've purchased a sandisk mini sd form another seller and hope that I have more luck
3,Not 150 X - more like 50 X,"I ordered this card based on the reviews and since the previous reviews were not quite accurate, I am posting this one. The item listing claims 150X High Speed. However, compared to my A-Data 150X card this one is much slower. It is faster than my Kingston ""normal"" speed card but it is not 150X, more like 50X in my opinion. A 50X card is fine but I wanted 150X to reduce the time between pictures on my Canon A 640. When I replace this one, I will get another A-Data 150X SD card.If you want 150 X, this is not the card to buy."
4,good idea but...,"Great idea, a 4gb sd card. However, my computer see's it as 1gb, my pocket pc see's it as 1gb, and my digital camera see's it as 1gb. Great if you have sompthing that can use it..."
1,Waste of time and money,"This book provides the reader with no information on offshore accounts. Neither does it give any information in regards to privacy, structuring etc... It is merely an attempt by the author to advertise his own scam. I would highly recommend and urge at the same time that you do not waste your time or money on this useless garbage. What a waste of valuable paper."
3,Three Stars for a Score of Three,"I just got my test results back, and I was relatively happy with a three. I outlined this book in the weeks before the testing day and I have to say it did help. My teacher also made us read specific chapters of Howard Zinn's ""A People's History of the United States."" Even though ""Zinn"" became the most popular swear word among my class, the book helped me superbly in my essays. I would recommend both Zinn and this for a good score of at least three, and possibly four if you studied harder than I did. If you are looking for a five, I would reccomend going to more than two sources - buy a few books and study off all you possibly can."
3,okay for a quick overview,"Personally I don't think this book is very useful because it is too concise. You will not do well on the AP test if you depend on this book completely. In fact, I think you will fail the essay portion if you did not study from any other book. However, this book is good for a quick overview and can refresh your memory if you know the stuff well."
3,X Files anyone?,"The official print still cut after all these years. This is an enjoyable non-classic of its genre, and I'm not the only one who feels Chris Carter, the creator of X-Files has definately seen it."
2,Gore but no script,The movie had a lot of gore but a verry bad script.The monster at the end look very cheap too.
3,A lemon given the four star treatment,"As funny as this movie is CONTAMINATION really only deserves one star. But the disc looks and sound so good, I can hardly believe it! So five for the DVD and one for the movie."
1,Alien Contamination,"The idea was to start watching old 80s sci fi movies to review for my website, but this one may have changed my mind.Low budget, terrible acting and terrible plot. There's absolutely no conflict in this movie until the last 15 minutes. I had no idea where the plot was going or why.People reference the gore like it something amazing - its pretty boring and does nothing for the movie.One positive: the soundtrack by ""Goblin"" was pretty cool and fit the time period, but overall I would've been happier not seeing this one. Waste of time."
4,No credits.,"Disappointed not to hear Goblin's score over the credits. The end credits were cut off. The picture quality could have been better as well. Otherwise great, gory Italian sci-fi."
4,contamination,"i rate movies on alot of things and some are new idea and new way of doing a idea, the actors, the looks of the women , the quality of film and the scenery were filmed and to me this one is a four its just different enough even though the noise in the movie is irritaing when there going to break open and invect someone"
1,warning: Avoid this Contamination,"Contamination is a horrible rip-off of Fulci films (which are not great either, but a few are enjoyable -Zombie, House by the Cemetery). Contamination was made by an man named Lewis Coates who used the pseudonym Luigi Cozzi. I don't know if he thought using an Italian name would subconciously aid him in creating an Italian-style film, or what...I am a fan of cheesy Italian horror, but this failed to deliver anything substantial in my opinion. There were scenes where people's chests would explode- this should have been cool, but it was where the Fulci rip-off was.Unless you have seen everything else, and just want a good laugh, I would avoid this film like a contamination."
4,Lugosi's best Poverty Row films on one disc!,"First of all, you know whether or not these are ""your"" type of movies. They're cheap, short and have Bela Lugosi just as his star was beginning to fade. THE CORPSE VANISHES is a typical Mongram 40's programmer, but Bela's really pretty good in it. The real attraction here is THE DEVIL BAT. An unexpected dose of humor is sprinkled throughout the macabre events. Lugosi is perfect as Dr. Carruthers, fiendlishly plotting deaths with his giant mutated bats. And surely no other film in history has used shaving lotion for such a sinister purpose! Naturally, one wishes for more supplemental materials. But the picture quality (and for the most part, the sound) is up to the usual Roan standard of excellence. There are several other povery row Lugosi films available from Roan (The Invisible Ghost, Bowery at Midnight, etc.) but if you only buy ONE, this is the one to get."
3,Too complicated-- one for the Perry Mason Completists.,"I am an unashamed Perry Mason fan. I always enjoy the frothy mix of law and ladies. Perry's snappy one-liners, the reliable Paul Drake and Della Street, the always complicated plots. They hit a sweet spot. Don't know why.The Case of the Fan Dancer's Horse is rather more complicated than others-- nearly annoyingly distracting in its complication. Two fan dancers, many men, horses. I kept having to concentrate on the characters and their names. The fact is, if you have to concentrate hard on a Perry Mason book, then you've already lost.One for the completists."
5,Ben 10 fans under 8 YO will love these,My son (daughter too) loves to watch Ben 10. Recently I ran across this Ben 10 Sumo Slammer Battle Set and purchased so he could carry them to daycare and share the fun with his friends. These are small toys (so don't worry about toting too much) and they are easily discernable (if you have watched the show you will be able to pick out each character).
2,hard to read,I found this book hard to read & maneuver around in. Maybe I should've gotten an earlier edition.
1,"Product Failure with 5 months, Poor Customer Service","I purchased the Protron 32in LCD TV at Sears. After 5 months, the sound on the TV stopped functioning. I tried Sears and they said I could not return it and had to go directly to manufacturer. I contacted manufacturer and obtained a RMA number. I requested that they pay for shipping, but they refused. I shipped TV at my cost $81. They received TV and it has been 2 months of continuous calling into some call center which keeps on telling me the TV will be in next week. I ask for a supervisor and they tell me I am speaking to one. I will never buy an off brand name again. I am trying to figure out who I can contact to put a formal complaint in against the company. This has been the worst company that I have ever dealt with!!! Protron and Spectrum...I hope to get a TV before they go out of business."
5,SpectorinIQ,"I must have gotten lucky also. Considering the price, it's been great and I haven't had any problems with it in the past 2 years."
4,Textbook of Anatomy & Physiology,"Easy to read, although sometimes dry. Excellent illustrations and definitions for either laymen, student nurses or allied health professionals."
1,"Try ""Constant Princess"" instead","Long, boring, character is flat and too much concentration on Jewishness of man who was in the employ of Spaniards. Every time he appears in the text, author has to underline that he was a Jew and converted one at that, Jew, Jew, Jew - all you see on those pages where this man is in the text. And she does not call him a Jew, she calls him some derogatory Spanish term for converts to Catholicism. Is she prejudiced or was she making a point with her writing? I could not tell. Read Philippa Gregory instead, ""The Constant Princess"", much livelier and interesting writing and character of Katherine of Aragon comes to live so vividly that you almost feel that it is you living through the years of misery and despair there with her."
4,I gotta digress...,"First off, this is a soundboard recording, pressed in a limited run of 1000. Obviously a fans recording, so expecting it to sound like a studio recording is a little beside the point. That said, it sounds quite good if you're not expecting top of the line sound reproduction from a major record company. Secondly, they were having fun and the remarks about untuned guitars and off-key vocals (way, way overstated) would be true of most groups live performances before an engineer gets ahold of them and ""fixes"" them. Honestly I don't hear much wrong until the last two tunes where they are joined by various Long Ryders and Chesterfield Kings in various states of confusion and inebriation. Like I said, they were having FUN, Scorgie's wasn't Madison Square Garden.If you're a RP fan this is a nice treat, otherwise I would agree that you should get the studio albums first. Sound quality 3/5, performance 3&1/2/5. Coolness factor...priceless."
4,"Really great set by the""Parade""","This cd has been slammed a bit by some,but the proof is in the pudding.These guy's rock drunk or not.Also not alot to document live wise w/the Rain Parade.Wish they could dig up another great sounding sound-board show in the future!"
1,confused,I was confused about what was being sold.I ended up with something that had to be installed in a device which I did not have.
4,Intriging and deadly game.,This campaign starts in a small town that can be added to any fantasy campaign world. The players are led on a round about trail to find the entrance to a large underground dungeon where they face kobles with a twist and a powerful and inteligent dragon. If the game master plays the parts right it can add up to a very enjoyable game that will last for weeks and months. many colorful maps and player aids are included as well as cardboard figures. Metal ones are available from ralpartha though.
4,they're great,"The receipe cards are really cute. The paper could be a little stiffer, but the plastic covers are definitely a plus."
2,Hard to put together and take apart,This was pretty much frustrating for me to get back together! My son never could figure it out! Very expensive!
1,Ultimate bumblebee not so ultimate,"My son wanted this item for his 6th b'day, so of course we bought it. It was late and when we finally got it, I was so disappointed!!! The advertising for this figure made it look so easy to transform. It was NOT easy, I had to wait until my husband, who is an engineer, to get home to help me transform it, and he couldn't even do it. This toy is surely not for young children and not worth the money. We have returned this item and I will not purchase another one until my son is much older. I do not know how single mom's would ever figure out how to help their sons work this toy. The toy looks nice and would be a good gift for an older boy or man who collects transformers."
1,"Wouldn't buy this again, ever","Purchased this for my grandson, he is a transformer FAN. Even with simply drawn outline instructions for the transformations, three adults couldn't figure it out. The last that I saw the toy, the grandson was just sitting there pushing the noise button, which I admit the sounds are cool."
3,Ultimate Bumblebee Transformable Figure,"Product was previously previewed and reviewed in stores and online before being purchased thru Amazon. We knew what we were getting and it appeared to be durable enough, however, after numerous purchases, we've found that all the new Transformer figures are not as durable as the Armada and Energon Collection. This particular item was returned for a faulty headlight, but we didn't keep it long enough to rate it further. FYI - Advertising says 'transform at the push of a button' - a statement that is both false and misleading to young children and naive parents."
3,Transformer Bumblebee Review,The overall picture of this toy was awesome but once you take it out of the box and try to get it together is a problem. My husband and I both have been unsuccessful with getting it together even with the directions. It just needs to be less difficult to put together once it has been taken out of the box.
4,"transform""bumblebee""","All I can say was it challenged all of us ""adults"" first time out butgrandson enjoyed having it to play with as it's his favorite movie now."
3,Definately a challenge,"It was definately a challenge to put together this Transformer especially when there was no instruction that came along with the toy. The step is quite challenging and one put together I noticed that the pieces doesn't quite fit the way they should. Some pieces are hard to fit while some are quite loose, like the wheels. Definately not worth the money Amazon was asking for.."
2,WAY too difficult for kids - even for some adults!,"This was the highlight of ""Santa's"" shipment. My son almost cried with excitement when he saw this. It is a VERY impressive looking toy, but it is so hard to transform, that Bumblebee has sat on a shelf as a display since December. The only crying my son was doing after he opened it was out of frustration. Out of curiosity, my husband put it together as ""fast"" as he could - 30 minutes. Seriously. I don't know who designed this for kids. I don't recommend this unless you are going to use it as a display like we did. It is very well made and neat looking though..."
3,Tough Bumble Bee,"I bought this for my 5 yr old for his birthday. I spent 30 minutes for the first time trying to convert the robot into the car (I had the instruction manual, if you lose it...well...). It said on the outside that it will shoot the rockets on its own, it doesnt. It does detects surronding sounds, and would turn the head in that direction.But somehow, my son lost interest in about an hour, and this $80.00 toy is sitting in the corner since then. Not very interactive, I would say more of a display thing."
2,Bumblebee,This product is one of the most difficult and annoying toys my son owns. It is very difficult to transform and it takes a lot of patience to transform this from car to robot or vice versa. If you prefer your sanity leave this item on the shelf. It is very frustrating....
2,"Ultimate Pain to ""transformer""",This was NOT the easiest toy to transform. Took Dad 45 minutes to transform from Robot to vehicle and it does not stay too securely. Fun noises and music. Has not been back to a robot since Dec. 26th. Directions need to be framed!
3,bumblebee transformer,"I wonder what kind of research does the toy company do when determining what age appropriat for childern and their toys? The bumblebee transformer says five and up,ya right. My husband was asked by our 6year old to transforme bumblebee from robot to car. After some time passed my husband in sear fustration gave the toy to me to figerout. Yes the toy came with direction (pictures showing how to do it which, was difficult for even me to understand). After a good 30 minuts passed I finily putting the toy togather. With out looking at the picture direction because the direction confused me.I can't see any five year old doing this task on their own. But I do say, the toy is mad strong enough that my son has not yet broke it and he seem to enjoys it a lot."
2,ultimate bumblebee not that good,"I brought this toy in Oct07, here are my comments:Likeness of the toy to movie: 60% (therefore I buy the optimus prime (leader class afterwards because it's more fun)bad things:in robot mode, chest is too low like a 50~year-old woman.The right arm is not bendable, too short makes it like a handicaparticulation is bad, very limited.The minor wings and the back lights are not placed correctly (with Optimus Prime's design I think it should be possible)I would rather have the car roof foldable so I could have a better look of the robot's back, now it's like a big butt.Good things:the rear wheels are really folded in like in movie which is much nicer than others.the chest, although it's placed not good, but it could be folded to be like which in movie."
5,Too much from this seller...[...]!!!,"This is a great toy. WE bought it for Christmas at Walmart [...]. It iss cool. In robot form, it talks , in car form it sings songs etc....My 5 year old loves it, except way too hard for him to switch back and forth, like most of them. but, more durable!!! Great toy [...]"
3,looks great,"This toy was complicated to convert but after about 20 minutes I finally got it well I bought it for my 5 year old and Im 39, It looks good but its not so durable some parts are very cheaply made and it takes time to get the conversion down with no trouble but my 5 year old loves it."
3,Cool but complicated,"We got this for my son who just turned 5. Although it's very cool, lots of movement/lights/sounds, it takes quite a lot to transform it from the car to robot and back. Several precise moves, clicks, pushes, and pulls. Also, we can't get it to make many sounds while in the car mode. Although it says ages 5+, there's no way a young child could do this without a lot of adult teaching. But if there is an adult willing to put in the time, my son really loves it."
1,"Horrible ""toy""","This thing ""looks"" cool but is impossible to transform. Both my nephew and his cousin got them for Christmas and neither the kids nor their parents can reassemble it in either direction once starting to unhook things. Both are now relegated to the back of the closet never to be played with again. What a waste of money!"
1,Very Disappointed,I purchased this toy for my son who is within the age group advertised for this toy. It broke within the first two hours of play. I would like to return the toy.Hasbro Transformers Ultimate Bumblebee Figure
4,Hasbro Transformer Ultimate Bumblebee,"My wife and I searched just about everywhere for this toy (product link - Hasbro Transformer Ultimate Bumblebee Toy) for our grandson, and he loves this toy. We are on vacation and missed his birthday (5 years), and we promised to buy this toy. He got a small one that didn't transform, and he wasn't happy until he got the real deal, thanks to Amazon. com."
2,Not fully disclosed,I purchased this book with the understanding Good ConditionThere is an abundent amount of underlining & writingin book which was not disclosedVery disappointed in codition of book
1,Rusted Rings,"I received the product, however, almost all 50 rings were rusted.It's curious how the person that packed these didn't even care to at least get some good ones. It showed lack of care. I'm quite disapointed.Unsatisfied Customer"
4,interesting if you like screenplays,"I read this screenplay because I wanted to learn about what such a document would even look like for an action movie that contains relatively little dialogue. If you haven't already seen the movie, or are not accustomed to reading screenplays, it may be hard to follow the action because the descriptions involve a few adjectives with changes in camera angles. The screenplay tells the true story of 2 lions who terrorized a bridge building project and killed hundreds of men. The actors and directors bring a lot to the table so you have to a big imagination if you expect to feel anywhere near the range of emotion you'd feel while watching the movie, especially since much of the effect of this movie has to do with the largeness and awe inspired by actually seeing the African landscape, though the book does include a few black and white screenshots. As a screenwriter Goldman is a master- it's amazing to me that the same guy wrote both Heat and the Princess Bride."
3,gift,Are gifts for my great-grandson but Fisher-Price has always been great products since my children were small. They have outlasted the children and grandkids.
5,A gift for my grandson,"My grandson just turned 1, and will love to play with this bus. I remember this bus from my childhood, however it has been upgraded with more sight and sound."
4,Little People School Bus,Bought as a gift. Very nice. Good sturdy toy. I tried to found things that would hold up to rough play.This toy works. I really love Fisher-Price toys.
5,Wonderful!,"My child loves the real school bus he rides on to preschool, every time he hears a loud truck he runs to the window to see if it's a school bus! So I wanted to get him one to play with at home. This is perfect. He lines all the people up, walks them onto the bus then drives it around randomly pressing on the driver to make the lights and sounds. He just loves it. The wheelchair is a doesn't really look like a wheel chair and I don't think he knows what it's supposed to be right now, but it's a nice idea for it to be included. If you have other little people from other Fisher-Price products they will fit on the bus too."
5,Big hit,My daughter (34 months old) plays with this for a good hour a day. She loves putting all of her toys inside and taking them on a ride around the house. Little People are a constant hit in our house.
5,Hours of entertainment,"My 3 year old grandson has been having the best time with this set. He has really started pretend play and this really adds to it. He makes the figures get on and off the bus through the doors. He has also started to sing. I heard him singing along with the ""stop and go"" song that it plays. I also heard him singing ""The Wheels on the bus"" while he was playing. I believe this is a very durable toy because I caught him riding it himself. A nice bonus was that it came with batteries and that they are AA, so easy to replace."
3,Thought it would have been better,"I bought this for my 2 year old for Christmas. She loves school buses. Everytime we pass by one, she screams school bus! We thought she would love it and play with it. However, this barely holds her attention. The lights are fun, but the quick diddy is a bit too short, wished it could have been better."
1,The Wheels don't turn - Only one little person came with it!,When I bought this new through Amazon I thought it would come with more than one character. It came with one little person - the driver. But what really disappointed me was that the wheels do not turn. It's as if the wheels are too light to turn. It's weird. Very disappointed! Usually little people toys are good quality for the money. I would not recommend this bus.
2,Politically correct Little People,The School Bus was a little disappointing. You can pretend to get people on and off the bus and you can push on the driver to get a short audio response. My granddaughter tired of it quickly.
2,not enough excitement,"my son would enjoy this more with more buttons and light and songs, it bores him easily"
5,My son LOVES it!,"He says ""school bus"" now every time he sees it. Has had it for about a year (he's almost 2 now) and still plays with it. It's a great toy!"
5,Great favourite,"I am an early childhood worker and have seen dozens of children love this toy. I purchased it for my grandson when he was 2, and he has used it so much. It still comes out frequently now he is 3. Well constructed and will great appeal."
5,a hit,this is a good learning toy and is sure to please any litte child. I have been pleased with most of the fisher price toys I have pruchased in the past.
5,pre-school pleaser,"For a 2 year old who enjoys looking at school buses on her way to day care every day, this is a real hit!"
4,This P C Bus is lots of fun...,"My one year old loves it!I had no idea when I went to buy this that it was so politically correct...the driver is Hispanic, one student is African American and the other has glasses and is in a wheel chair! This is a great way for my son to learn a little bit about diversity at a very young age.It is a very cute toy and we'll be playing with it for quite a long time."
4,Good toy for toddler,"I bought this toy two months ago for my 18 month old and he still enjoys playing with it every day. He also enjoys the airplane. My only complaint is that the door comes off pretty easily, so we've just left it off. My son loves it anyway!"
4,Batteries Included,Fisher Price Little People Lil' Movers School Bus is a big hit with my two year old granddaughter. She puts various stuffed animals in it through the open top and talks to them and enjoys the short sound effects from the driver's seat. It is a toy that is open to the imagination of the child and best of all The Batteries were Included!
5,My Son absolutely loves his school bus!,"My son got this when he was about 17 months and he is now nearly 2 and he still plays with it. It is his favorite toy! It is really well made, solid and cute all at he same time. Just love it and would recommend it to anyone."
4,"Great Toy, but next time make a better door.","My one year old son loves this toy. It's one of his favorites. The only problem is the door came off almost immediately and now every time I re-attach it he purposefully pulls it off. Couldn't they make a door that stays on better? He really likes opening and closing the door, that's part of the fun - but then he just rips it right off. But, it's still a great toy, and very PC with the multicultural kids and the wheelchair (the wheelchair doesn't seem to really have a proper space on the bus, though)."
3,False Advertising,"There is only one character that comes with this product, even though the description says that it comes with three!!"
4,Durable,"Some of the issues noted are valid, it leaves a 'wax' streak etc. But most waxes do that. Its a trade-off of protection/durability vs a mirror shine.Found it more durable than most, just as leading consumer mag said.On cooler days out of the sun, takes more than 5 minutes to dry(perhaps 15, big whooop). But I like it that way, leaves more wax behind to protect the surface."
2,Leaves way too many streaks,"I've used many different waxes in my life. I decided to try the black magic liquid wax because of its ""longer lasting"" reputation. Unfortunately, I'll never know if that's true because I used this wax on one side of an SUV before I gave up. Application is easy, but that's true with most waxes now. Removing the wax is another story though. I applied the wax in the shade and let it sit before attempting to remove, just as I do with any other wax. There were streaks and swirl marks left behind from the wax. I had to wipe over it again and again, until eventually I just went back using the Mother's wax I had been using before. I will not be applying this product to any cars again in the future."
2,The most effort of any wax I've used,"I bought this because of its top rating in Consumer Reports. Having read some of the reviews here and elsewhere I applied it only to the hood as a test. What a nightmare! Basically it gives the impression that it never dries, so there's a greasy-looking, smudgy film no matter how long I wait for it to dry or how long I buff. Maybe it's deliberate -- could this be where the name ""wet shine"" comes from?Used this on the wife's dark blue Accord. Possibly the effect isn't as noticeable on a light-colored car.This may well be the most durable, or protective (or whatever virtue) of any wax. But I'll never find out, because it's just too much of a pain in the *** to use. Giving it two stars instead of one, only because it didn't do anything really crazy like eat through the sheet metal."
2,Great for Long-Lasting Protection,I began using this wax when a leading consumer magazine gave it a top rating. I do have to be careful to apply a super-thin amount of wax because the wax is harder to buff out than a paste wax like meguiars ultimate. I usually apply it with a porter cable buffer and remove the wax by hand with a microfiber towel--you need to have plenty of these on hand for this wax. The shine is quite good and it lasts for a really long time.
4,Antidote rocks,"To be totally honest, I didn't like this album at first. Mostly because I listened to it in my headphones. Not headphones music this is, alright? This is great club music to cranck up on your stereo or to put on in a club and just totally let it make you sweat. Antidonte's first called Fight or Flight is even better for that. Check'em out."
3,Ole Buttermilk SKy,"A little disappointing. Not the best presentation of Hoagy Carmichael's work, although no doubt authentic and original."
4,Women at Work,"I have really enjoyed the book, especially when it talks about various when and how they have achieved success. Just wish they would come out with a newer version."
1,Terrible design,"Gluing plastic on something that contains very hot liquid is a TERRIBLE idea. But I guess it's cheaper. I got one of these french presses, the filter came off because it was glued. I returned it and got a replacement. And this time the handle is coming off.Awful, cheap design. Bodum can do better for sure (I have a smaller Bodum that's perfect), but they tried to make a cheaper product probably. Avoid."
3,BIG French Press,"This french Press makes a lot of coffee. The mechanism works well and the fact that it can go into my dishwasher is a bonus. I have a very old Bodum French press that was too small to serve our needs. The one thing that I like about it rather than the new one is the construction. On the new one there is too much plastic and the handle is less secure than my old one. I also appreciate the ceramic in the top of my old one which insulates the coffee to keep it warm. Yet, for our needs, this french press does just fine."
2,Pain in the R$E!!,"Handle not anchored on bottom, so you have play when you sling out old grounds. Lid is not like previous versions of Bodum's presses, and it's very difficult to tell when you have the pour spout aligned to actually pour coffee. Can't tell you how many times I have dribbled coffee because I had the pour grid aligned over the handle instead of the pour spout. Pain in the A$$!!! So badly miss the old Bodum's but can't seem to find replacement carafe!! This one sucks!!"
5,"A pleasingly mature, complex album of medative rhythms","Ganger's first album is an innovative blend of ambient, Brian Eno-esque guitar work/assorted sounds and lyrical melodies. While most tracks are instrumental or have words mixed at almost inaudible background levels, the effect emphasizes the integrated whole of the music. Overall, the entire album is richly layered and mellow with a very compelling complexity."
5,Exciting sound for those who want something different,"Just when you think you have Ganger music figured out, they change the sound, and wham, you have to rethink. This CD is quite unlike previous recordings and each track offers something vibrantly different from the previous one. The vocals are minimal yet intriguing and the musi complex--you find yourself listening again and again and picking up on new threads all the time. Great stuff from a group that makes its own trends rather than follows others, and then reworks those trends in new ways so that you never get tired of what's on offer. Check it out."
3,I totally agree with Stowe,"I bought both ""Badges and Insignia of Third Reich"" and ""German Uniforms of the Third Reich"" from Amazon.com. I was disappointed. I'm a modeller and looking for reference books for the German uniforms and insignias. But I found out those books may be good sources for the collectors or historians, but not for modellers. It should use tables for the illustration and catagorize the shoulder strips and insignias by ranks. It does not have enough information for the representation of color used around/on the shoulder strips and insignias."
2,Book on German Badges & Insignias...,"This book has the right idea. Shows the Insignias and Badges to the German Army as well as the other German forces. It explains in detail what they are and who wore them. It should have more detail and colour in the photos. The colour ones in the center of the book are not enough to show great detail.As you would know that the German Military used different colours to represent the different units. So, in Black and White photos they would all look alike(for example a German Infantry officer, a Major shoulder board would have White on the bottom. and an Artillary officer would have Red on the bottom of the shoulder board).Even though this book explains the different types of Insignias and Badges...The Authors should concentrate more on showing the realistic samples in live photos with colour more then even drawings."
3,Good but a Bit Hard to Read,"I must say that there is a lot of good information in this book but the general layout leaves much to be desired, at least for me. The reviews that I read prior to my purchase, unfortunately did not sway me one way or the other. I hope that mine sways you!The text is pages and pages away from the drawings and in order to read and ""digest"" the information, it is a constant shuffle between the text and the drawings and back again. A never ending read then moving to the pictures and back again. Though I read much of the book in this manner, I have all but given up on the book and will only use it as a ""ready reference"" and NOT a book to even hope to read and digest!"
3,This guide only covers half of the original!,"Be warned -- the latter half of the book's title has been chopped off of the webpage! This is the second volume of a two volume set, covering (if I recall correctly) 1861 onwards."
2,Don't forget to check spelling when you write a book.,The book has lots information. It's just organized poorly. It has several spelling mistakes in a couple of the chapters in the beginning. I haven't looked at the rest yet. It is a shame that this is the quality of educational material that people are satisfied with.
5,Cookin'!,"First off, the fidelity on this recording is quite wonderful. Hats off to the European jazz fans and the terrific job of recording. The first half of the program features Ella and her supple voice-one of the most beautiful vocal instruments ever-is a joy to behold. Fitzgerald was always favored my jazz musicians and you can hear why. Man she can swing,daddio. Peterson is a very fine accompanist besides being the world's best jazz pianist and the other half of the concert features the Peterson trio with lots of jazz greats. As jazz musicians like to say, this concert is a ""bitch!"""
5,Songs for Devotion by Hosanna,"My sister-in-law borrowed this to me years ago, when I finally sought a relationship with our Lord. I am so glad I was able to find this particular Songs for Devotion CD, and ordered one for my friend and daughter. Thanks Amazon. This CD really leads you into the realm of worship and the presence of God."
1,Poorly designed nylon labeling tag.,Poorly designed product. Not enough room on tag to write any lablel information on. A regular nylon cable ties is about all this product is equal to. Save your money look else where for a labeling tag.
3,"Big bubbles, big mess","Pros: makes big bubbles. doesn't seem to use a lot of bubble juice. batteries have decent life (although requires a lot of batteries)Cons: the tray to catch the dripping bubble juice doesn't stay put. Even when it does stay put, it doesn't catch all of the bubble juice resulting in a mess (although, at least it is a ""clean"" mess). We also had to tweak the wand a bit (manually and with a screwdriver) because we were not getting many bubbles. Now it works better.Decision: Fun. The machine does the work for you and blows huge bubbles. But it's messy, requires a lot of batteries and is not very cheap. If you have the energy, a good 1.00 thing of bubbles is probably just as good."
2,More junk from China,"This was disappointing. It tries to make very large bubbles. It worked almost fine on the first day but then not as good since then. The drip tray under the nozzle (as shown in the pic) does not work, bubbles still drip down and onto the floor. Is it not worth the price. More junk made in China."
3,Gazillion Jumbubbler Giant bubble machine,"The tube that sucks up the bubble solution was fused (not patent) and the unit did not produce bubbles, of course. The top and bottom pieces do not fit well. Poor quality control."
5,good ladder,"I order the ladder and got it very fast and I use the a few times now and I love it you can put it the way you want it and feel saftey on it. I like it very much, good ladder."
5,It get me on the roof.,"NOTE: I definitely don't use daily (i.e., couple times a year).Got me on the roof extended. Worked well getting up about 9' in tower/V for hanging Xmas lights around the garage facia. Stores quite compactly. Exactly what I expected. Extra hinges came with it (neat!)."
1,ADVERTISING A BIT DECEIVING,"Louisville Ladder L-2094-17 Type IA 300-Pound Rated Aluminum Multipurpose Ladder, 17-FootWHEN I ORDERED A LADDER THAT SAID IT WAS 13 FEET, I BELIEVED IT WAS JUST AS IT HAD BEEN ADVERTISED ""A STEP LADDER 13'WHAT WE GOT IN MY OPINION IS NOTHING MORE THAT A 6' ""STEP LADDER.""

5,Everything you need in one book,"Though I wrote review on the booklet on Amazon.com years ago it seems to not be here. This small paperback has everything you need in order to be prepared for Total Consecration according to Saint Louis Marie de Montfort. I wish I had found this earlier. Louis de Montfort says in his book 'True Devotion to Mary,' that those who wish to take up this special devotion should spend three weeks imbuing themselves with the spirit of Jesus through the most Blessed Virgin.You will find that in order to prepare you will need several books, including the one I mentioned by de Montfort above, `The Imitation of Christ', the Gospels, litanies and prayers, among others. Or you only need to find this small book"
5,A wonderful devotion to the Blessed Mother!,"If you would like to make a special practice and more than a novena to God's Mother, this is the most beautiful Apostolic Action to do!It came highly recommended by a Capuchin Friar."
5,A quick and exciting adventure with J.W. Jackson,"As a long-time fan of J.W. Jackson, Zee, and the cast of characters who make up J.W.'s world, I was excited to find a J.W. Jackson I hadn't read yet. Philip Craig wrote tight, well-paced mysteries with a strong sense of place. Reading a J.W. Jackson is a visit to the Vineyard without using the ferry. Vineyard Prey is no exception.In this outing, we are enjoying the peace and quiet of December on the Vineyard when long-time friend Joe Begay asks J.W. for help. Joe, whose background has always been a mystery, is in trouble. Soon Joe's trouble involves J.W. in ways neither one expects or wants. Vineyard Prey is more of a spy thriller than other Vineyard mysteries. Joe's mysterious background has put him in danger, and now it affects J.W. and his family as well. There could be an international assassin on the island, and J.W. needs to find him (or her) before more deaths occur."
3,Vineyard Prey,"Another vineyard mystery , but very similar to previous books. i wasn't sure I hadn't read it before--I hadn't. I would not recommend it unless you are really bored and need a quick beach read."
3,pretty good,"I just read this and it is ok., the plot line dragged out a bit, but it was still an ok. Martha's Vineyard mystery"
5,Interesting,"This is an amazing book of statistics! Some poor guy locked himself in a small, windowless room with records dating up to before the founding of the Marine Corps -for who knows how long- and compiled this behemoth. It contains countless statistics, lists, and enough bizarre, useless information to keep you entertained for hours. Of course, most of this information is completely useless, but still fascinating. I would recommend it for anyone with entirely too much time on their hands."
5,Teaches children ages 8 and older the basic math skills of Division,"Rock 'N Learn is a premier producer of DVDs for children that are as entertaining as they are educational. ""Division Rap"" (55 minutes) teaches children ages 8 and older the basic math skills of Division, including story problems, remainders, long division, and more. Through the use of animated characters, young learners will learn just what division is, how it's used, and even be able to practice what they are learning with free worksheets for the program obtainable through [...]. This flawlessly produced and thoroughly 'kid friendly' DVD is enthusiastically recommended for family, school, and community library educational DVD collections."
4,Third grade appropriate,"Not as catchy as the multiplication video. There is a good explanation of what division ""looks like."" Kids like it but don't request repeat viewings."
3,Good for a young audience.,"We love the visual presentation of division concepts and the fact that so many division problems are presented. The concepts are presented well so that a learner can progress from the visual presentation of division all the way to division fact memorization. I still feel Rock 'n Learn videos are lacking in their 'engagement factor' with children. Leap Frog has a much more engaging way of teaching the concepts they cover. The Science Videos by Rock 'n Learn are moving towards that Leap Frog, story-telling, character based learning style. However, the Math Rock 'n Learn videos are lacking that. Rock 'n Learn videos do have strengths in visual presentation of math concepts and in repetition of presentation, both of which are important. I'd also like to see the division facts of 10, 11, and 12 covered in this video."
5,High Quality,The drink stirrers were an even higher quality than I expected. They are very heavy and hold up well in the dishwasher. I am extremely satisfied with this product and would recommend it highly. I have seen the same or similar stirrers sellng a few months back for $60. $20 was quite a bargain since they look like they should cost so much more.
5,"A ""Superbowl"" Saver!","Okay, I admit it...I'm the only one in Atlanta who didn't watch the Superbowl. It was raining, Media One screwed up the cable, and I had this one book left on the shelf. Gotta say, the first two stories were warm-ups (good ones, though) for the main event. ""This Side Of Forever"" knocked me out! It had me screaming with laughter and looking for my own box of Famous Amos cookies. It's a great story! Jamal Anderson (of the Falcons) is cute, but I'm glad I got hooked on this story instead!"
3,Relaxing beach party reggae,"One of my favorite Shabba albums. Lots of cheesy synth and lyrics, but hey, that is reggae. Maxi Priest also does vocals on a few tracks. If you are looking for a nice, relaxing sound to vibe to on the beach or at a party, this is a good start."
2,A little small,"The boat goes about 1-2 mph and the truck goes about 3 mph.The boat and truck can go about 15 feet before it goes out of range.The toy is very small and I reccomend use for small pools and bathtubs because of it's low range.One of the only good parts is that the directions say you recharge the power pack for 2 minutes and it lasts for 3-4 minutes, but it lasts for about 10 minutes after recharged and that it's good for people who like mini stuff, but not for people who want speed from mini stuff.The remote control only works when it's facing the vehicle.I reccomend you to buy something for a little more money that goes faster, is bigger and has a better range."
1,Don't buy it!,"You know the saying.....you get what you pay for...well in this case you will pay alittle and get even less! I am thankful that I gave it to my daughter & her friend as an early Christmas present and found out almost immediately that purchasing it was a mistake. I thought having a ""chager"" would reduce the need for batteries - but the charger operates on batteries. One good thing is it only take a few minutes to charge / bad thing is the charge only last for a few minutes."
2,Get something better,It seemed fun while it lasted. A child can charge it and switch the engine between boat and car. Even the short charge time wasn't a big deal. BUT it broke in less than a day. I am still waiting for my return label.
4,"A ""Whitman's Sampler"" of British Music","This budget collection contains selections from various popular British composers ranging from Clarke (Trumpet Voluntary) to Malcom Arnold. This is the kind of music that would (and often is) played on BBC ""light"" classical radio. Many of the pieces are familiar but the inclusion of Bridge's ""The Sea"" is a happy exception. The performances and sound are uniformly good and at this price you can't really go wrong. I enjoyed these musical bon-bons and unless you're looking for deep and serious works, I suspect that you will too.Recommended."
3,West Wing Music,"I originally heard CJ on the West Wing sing along with this song and I had to have the CD. The song is great but the other songs are average, making the CD average."
3,Acid jazz,"What does this term mean? I can only think that it is a half way house between Smooth and traditional. Ronny's early work falls into this category, this album, being the best example of this. This is a strong set that comprises fast tempo joints (GURU on 'Season for change') your more mid tempo offerings ( the Jackal, featuring the Lovely Dana Bryant, I think) the sultry slow joints( Vanston Place) This is an excellent follow up to 'The Antidote'.Also, the vinyl has two bonus tracks' Pent up House' which is a busy mid tempo offering, and the moody' Midnight lady."
2,Mind spackle,"Hmm, you might have heard this the last time you were at the dentist. Pleasant enough, but nothing worth your money...I was dissappointed with this album. I had expected a little more acid from one of the pioneers of acid jazz. Instead, in spite of scripted rap in 'Season for Change,' it sounds like that smooth jazz they play on ""Lite FM."" The best track on the album is 'The Jackal;' it doesn't take itself as seriously as the other tracks.If you think Pat Metheny is a funkmaster, then this album is for you. Otherwise, if you want mid-tempo 1970's makeout soul, try the Crusaders."
3,For West Wing Completists,"Although it's not really a complete review of this album, it should be noted that Allison Janney as C.J. Cregg lip-syncs ""The Jackal"" in one of the greatest scenes ever of the television show ""The West Wing"". Just listening to the song reminds me of how great that scene is. WW or Janney fans, enjoy."
3,Jazzman,"Ronny Jordan is defintely my favorite jazz artist, love his mix of jazz, R&B and the occasional rap. This is my fifth CD of his and my least favorite after just listening to it. I would rate them as follows: 1). The Antidote 2). Brighter Day 3). At last 4). Light to Dark. The CD starts strong & finishes strong, but the middle is just OK. However, like all his other CD's they sounded better after about the 3rd time listening, so I may be premature with this rating?"
5,Invaluable Reference for any SQL Anywhere DBA !,"In a word: Awesome! This is the definitive book on Sybase SQL Anywhere 9. If you use this at work, especially in a replicated environment, then you MUST have this on your shelf.This is a down-to-earth, no-holds barred approach to dealing with the good/bad/indifferent aspects of SQL Anywhere Studio 9. I am a data architect for a company that manages over 4,600 remote databases and this book has single-handedly helped me solve issues we have been having for months.The author, Breck Carter, is a man who has been in the trenches with ""the rest of us"" to solve some of the most vexing data management problems. The solutions are as simple as they are elegant.Written in a ""real-world"" tone, this book gets to the nitty-gritty of 99% of problems. The chapter on Mobilink replication is worth the price of the book alone as it goes into extreme detail on the how/whens/whys of moving data around and how to best utilize this impressive feature.Highly Recommend!"
3,Very good resource,I purchased this book to teach my children to play without professional lessons. It simplifies the process so almost anyone can learn. It enables me to sight read hymns at church without even practicing.
2,rusty,"we got this set for 10 or 11 dollars. The large knife has something that clanks around inside the handle and the paring knife tends to get rust spots. I guess they are okay for the money, but still wouldn't have bought them had I known what I was getting. I expect better quality from KitchenAid."
4,Great for the price,"I'm not sure why the other reviewer had problems with the order, the knives I received were as pictured above. The paring knife is great. It's very sharp, well balanced, and the handle fits great in my hand. This paring knife is one of the best tools in my kitchen. I haven't found much use for the utility knife.Based on the quality of these, I'm buying several more KitchenAid knives from Amazon."
4,Incredible CD,This mix is amazing! They take so many songs I love and put them all together. Highly recommended!!!
3,Eeeeeh.,"Guess I am the only one who didn't care for these! =/ At first they were great. Very chocolaty and yummy. Towards the end of this huge box though? The taste was starting to wear thin.I cancelled my Subscribe & Save to this. I have had many other EAS lowcarb bars & shakes, and always enjoy them. This was a bit much though. If you only eat these once in awhile, this is probably fine. I was having one a day, and definitely got sick of the fake taste after so long."
3,"Good, balanced, lower carb bar option......","....but of the low carb EAS bars, this is the most bland tasting, in my opinion. The ""crisps"" are the best tasting option of the Carb Control EAS bars."
1,disappointing!,"As a big Gaelic Storm fan from the beginning, I was looking forward to the latest CD. Unfortunately, it is a big disappointment. It seems to lack the class and true Irish feeling of the previous albums. I know many of the songs on this album are supposed to be fun, but actually they are sort of- to be blunt- stupid! ""Swimming in the Sea"" on the previous album was fun- compare that to ""Punjab Patty"" on this one. I will wait for the next album and keep my fingers crossed!"
2,Nothing memorable,"I absolutely love Gaelic Storm and was really looking forward to this latest release. However, when I played through this album not one song caught stuck in my memory. Usually there is at least one tune that you find yourself humming but I can't recall a single tune from this collection. I decided this might very well be the last CD I'll ever purchase. I'm making the switch to an all electronic music collection and will be more selective before purchasing an entire album collection again. For their next release I'll sample each song but if nothing catches my ear then I'll pass."
3,I used to think Gaelic Storm was the best...,"...until I got a taste of Lúnasa and Kíla on the CD ""Untamed: Next Generation Celtic."" GS is still lots of fun and great live, but I liked them better when they played more traditional Celtic music (i.e. their first two albums). I miss the blistering fiddle solos at the end of Bonnie Ship the Diamond/Tamlinn, The Devil Went Down to Doolin, and After Hours at McGann's. There's precious little of that on this album. I recommend the Untamed CD and Lúnasa's Otherworld album (especially the medley Lafferty's/Crock of Gold/Lady Birr/Abbey Reel) for anyone looking for even more ferocious, more rollicking, super-fast fiddle, flute, and pipe action."
4,"Brash, Young, Celtic","This album makes for a pleasant change. There is no doubt that it is celtic in its origins but the style is not traditional. Instead, it is the work of young people singing their own songs instead of those songs of their forbears. It loses nothing; instead, something is gained.These guys are competent musicians and good performers. They are a breath of fresh air."
4,Great value!,Boots appear sturdy and are true to size. Purchased to wear on expedition to Antarctica and hoping that with thermal socks they will be warm enough. The price was low enough to allow me to scrap them at the end of tour and not bring home penguin and seal droppings in my travel bag.
1,North and South,"I thought this was a video. When I put it on the dvd player, it came out as words on a page and not a video at all."
5,just your everyday sign.. or maybe not,"There are lots of signs out there, for football lovers, baseball lovers, golf lovers, even bbq lovers. One sign I remember from the latter, parking for "" insert text"" only all others will be ""more text"". They are normally fun and easy to maintain, cute as decorations or the person who wants something different. This sign in particular is usefull, believe or not in meeting Romanians. Many Romanians like myself in the US would not be able to tell other Romanians from the general population except for items like a RO(Romania) bumper sticker, Romanian t-shirt and the like. This is one of those items that could get you noticed by the Romanian community as a ""HEY I'm Here"" sign. It is also great as a gift to people who may have a collection of these signs or wish to adorn things like an office, a business or the like. Got a Romanian friend? Give them one of these see what they will say. May you find many Romanians along the way."
1,Not vintage...,"Since there were three of these Robocop things and the first one was great and the last one was bloody awful, one might be forgiven for assuming that the second one might not be that bad. But one would be wrong. Avoid."
1,IT'S SAD TO SEE HOW LOW THE ROBOCOP MOVIES HAVE REALLY GONE,"IN THE 2ND INSTALLMENT IN THE PRIME DIRECTIVES SERIES, ROBOCOP GOES CRAZY AND STARTS TO WREAK HAVOC ON DETROIT. BUT TROUBLE FOR ROBOCOP SOON COMES WHEN HIS SYSTEM STARTS TO BREAK DOWN ON HIM AND EVEN WORSE IS THE FACT THAT OCP HAS MADE A NEW ROBOCOP TO STOP HIM, WHICH IS MODELED AFTER ROBO'S MURDERED PARTNER, JOHN CABLE. THIS IS VERY VERY BORING AND IT'S VERY VERY POINTLESS. I MUST SAY THAT PAGE FLETCHER IS BY FAR THE WORST ROBOCOP TO EVER APPEAR ON SCREEN. HE MAKES ROBERT JOHN BURKE SEEM LIKE PETER WELLER. WELL, SO FAR, THE 1ST 2 MOVIES IN THE PRIME DIRECTIVES SERIES HAVE BEEN BOTH EQUALLY BORING, I STUTTER TO THINK WHAT PART 3 IS GONNA BE LIKE."
1,POS!,"Everything about this movie is a monstrosity. The only thing that would even be considered as descent is the story line. How does a machine/human have the ability to cry? Unless there's an evolution in his organic parts that allow him to have human fluids, there is no sense at all. Then in the past, Alex Murphy looks like he's in his 60s, wasn't he about 40 when he transfered in Detroit in Robocop? What was up in adding Star Wars into the mix? The dual electrical weapon? Do they really think incorporating other movie's elements would make it better? Then how the world would you make something about the same? 15 years later, technology would be better and that would mean that improvements would be there when building another one. How about a rocket launcher or a laser weapon? Guess that's too smart to do. I rather watch Robocop 3 which they also screwed up on. The only true Robocop is Peter Weller w/ Paul Verhoeven and Irvin Kershner as the directors. ALL OTHERS SUCK!"
3,Rewiew of Robocop 2,"Good movie, but as often happens the first is the better one. Haven't seen the third but i've heard that's a lot worse"
4,Pretty Good Sequel,"If you are a fan of Robo Cop, the first movie, I can't see you not liking this one. The story was different. The action ramped up even higher. Don't get the negative reviews for this. Like I said, if you like Robo Cop this will fill the bill for you. Pretty good second movie here."
2,Awful Sequel!,"I am not sure what movie some of these people were watching but this was a painful movie to watch. They should have just ended Robocop after the first movie and been happy. I would not rent this movie again let alone buy it, save your money!"
2,accomplished special effects but dismal script,"Unfortunately I have to concede that I found the film to be highly unpleasant.Unlike the first film the violence is unremitting,with automatic weaponry blazing throughout the movie.Eventually the repetiousness of the action scenes tires the viewers.The villains in the original were so much more credible and frightening.Judged on its own merits the film is passable action move but compared to Verhoevan's original and moving dystopian masterpiece it is a severe letdown."
2,Sad,"After the success of the first Robocop, most would think that a better sequel could have been made. That's not the case here. Character developement and a credible plotline are quickly forgotten for mind numbing inappropriate violence. Sure, the first one was louded with blood and gore but it also has a decent story backing it up."
1,One of the biggest disappointments ever!,"Robocop 2 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Having been mesmerized by the first film, I went into this one having high expectations, especially with Irvin Kershner (Empire Strikes Back) at the helm. The movie opens with out any credits or title at all, which was strange. It moves very fast into Robocop trying to visit his wife again, which immediately brought a feeling of depth to his character. But that is abandoned quickly, like they wanted to get it over with, and they movie into 90 minutes of useless gore, profanity and poor plot. The special effects were much worse than the original and the human element, which made the first one so good, is all but gone. I remember standing up when the credits were rolling and just making a loud ""Aahhhh"" sound and most of the people agreed. Very poor!!"
1,Awwwwww,"What i can say that this film is boring and predictable,the first one beats it by 4 stars.It has stong violence and action,but if you want jackie chan style action and at least humour don't bother buying this one,you won't be happy,won't be happy watching it twice or more it'll bore extremely."
3,Behave yourselfs!,"Peter Weller returns as Robocop in this action packed sequel to the ultra-violent Robocop. Although the message about society from the first movie is still apparent, it seems much more obvious and forced. It seems the filmmakers have gone straight for the action instead of the meaning of the film. It's a fun watch, but is still extremely violent."
3,ROBO'S BACK,ROBOCOP [PETER WELLER] AND HIS PARTNER [NANCY ALLEN] RETURN TO BATTLE CORPORATE CORRUPTION AND A POWERFUL GANG OF DRUG DEALERS [LEAD BY TOM NOONAN]. ALMOST AS VIOLENT AS THE FIRST MOVIE. BUT IT'S NOWHERE NEAR AS ENTERTAINING. PETER WELLER IS STILL COOL AS ROBOCOP. GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS AND GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES MAKE THIS AN ACCEPTABLE SEQUEL.
3,Lots of violence and not too much action.,"This movie was good, but was crammed with violent bloody scenes and gorey fighting. It was great action but too intense for someone my age. It is not great material for me, but has some neat action! And by the way, WHERE IS CAIN??"
3,Not Much Here.,"ROBOCOP is a classic 80's action movie. ROBOCOP 2 should have been a decent sequel, after all the screen play was written by Frank Miller, the guy responsible for revitalizing Batman, and it was directed by Irvin Kershner (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK). Unfortunately, the movie isn't all that great. Kershner did a decent job with what material he had, but he didn't have much. The movie is dry and lacks the empathy and humor of the original. In fact, the film is basically a complete rehash of the original (without the origins of RoboCop). Therefore, instead of a classic 80's action film, ROBOCOP 2 is just an average nihilistic action flick."
4,not as good as the original but its still good,"ok first off i want to say that the first robocop was a better movie. it had a dark setting and was in every way one of those movies that everyone should see. robocop2 in a way ignored the first film with very few refrences to it at all. they also took out the original basil poledouris soundtrack that contributed so much to the first film's atmosphere. i still really liked robocop2 mainly because it had some good acting a fair script lots of action and great special effects for its time. Cain was a WOW. i really loved the robo and cain fight, that was very entertaining and is the highlight of the movie. after all is said and done, i feel that the only drawbacks to this movie are that it wasn't as dark as the first film and the soundtrack was weak."
4,True Sequel to RoboCop,"Ignore the editorial review listed on this page..it's for the lousy RoboCop 2 movie (1990) and NOT this new re-imagined sequel made in 2000. Despite its low budget this movie builds upon the original RoboCop movie and picks up 10 years after the end of that film. This four part movie (Dark Justice, Meltdown, Resurrection and Crash and Burn), shows the continued growth of the character Alex Murphy/RoboCop and his struggle to balance his current existence with the past life he knew. It has a lot fun action sequences and introduces new characters such as John Cable and James Murphy. Take a look its a lot of fun."
3,Bigger is not always better,"Robocop was such a huge success that it only made sense to do a sequel. However as time has proven once again, bigger is not always better.Robocop 2 takes place about a year after #1. In that time the Police have gone on strike and OCP is slowly taking over every aspect of Detroit. Robocop is out to stop this new drug that has hit the street called Nuke (basically it's kind of like Heroin), and the creator of the Drug Kain. After succeeding in doing so OCP uses Kains brain to Create Robocop 2. But when it goes renegade it is to the original to stop this menace and set things right.Robocop 2 proved that bigger is not always better. WHile this one does feature more action and in some ways more despicable villians, it loses some of the dark humor and just over all good directing that made the first a classic. WHile it is not terrible as some may have you believe but it is in no way a great movie. It's Ok, a popcorn flick, with a lot of violence and gore."
3,A bit iffy,"I wasn't sure about this film. Nothing changes with it. There are loose ends that just aren't tied up, and it just didn't work for me.It was good to see Peter Weller and Nancy Allen reunited, and the latter has a slightly better hairstyle!At the beginning of the film, Alex's wife comes into it, and comes to see him, now as Robocop. And then she's forgotton about. It would have been good, if Robocop had been allowed to try and rebuild the relationship with his wife, but instead, he turns round, and tells her that her husband is 'dead'. And also, the little brat reminds him of his son.If you thought Alex got a beating in the previous movie, then Robocop really gets a beating in this one. So much so, he's all over the place!I'm still not sure about this film. Sometimes, the second in trilogies (take Scream for example) are pretty rubbish, but I've been told that the third is even worse, so I think I'll like the first one, and wait for the rest to grow on me."
4,"""Behave Yourselves!""",Not nearly as good as the first one but it has its moments. Peter Weller remains strong in the lead role. The action and Phil Tippet's stop motion effects are what is worth seeing here.
4,"pretty disturbing, but good movie regardless","I loved the first robocop, the second was darker and slightly more disturbing and the third was decent.i was surprised how disturbing this movie turned out as alot of people were knocking the violent content, first of all the robot villain ""cain"" is disturbing in it's frightening/bizarre presense and i just can't seem to put my finger on it, maybe its the way he mumbles and growls instead of using proper speech or his demented apearance. Apart from this, other parts include a disturbing knife torture scene and the extracton of cain's brain.This and the films violent/disturbing content may make this movie not for the squeamish but it is a pretty good film nonetheless."
4,Cop on the Edge,"RoboCop 2 is probably the greatest movie when it comes to fighting the baddies.Drugs, brains, money, and a cop-killing kid spice up the adventure!If you have seen the previous Robo film, you should know he has a slow talking way of speech. That is why I enjoyed the third the best because it took Peter Weller about 2 minutes to say ""Where is Cain?""Robert John Burke beats him by a longshot in heroic dialogue, action, and look because Burke had 5 o-clock shadow. Still, if you like RoboCop, this is a must see!"
4,Ugly Sequel,"Of course all of the Robocop movies are dark, mean, ugly, and violent except the third one, (which I enjoyed the best.) But Robocop 2 was more entertaining, surprsing, and way better than the orignal, and Robocop tops off better than the Termanitor. But if your in the mood for a dark violent sci-fi action movie than this film is for you."
3,Can't top the original,Robocop 2 is a watchable and entertaining movie for those who saw the first.But it lacks freshness and some parts are just disgustingly violent.
2,Bad sequel,Why is it that all the good movies end up with the worst sequels? The plot line is one of the baddest in movie history with the only redeeming quality being the over the top violence.
5,"DATED, BUT STILL COOL",The effects do seem a but ropey in places but this movie is still good by todays standards. People are always too harsh on Robocop 2 because it is so violent in places but much more violent films are made today. I'm glad a lot of people are finally judging this fairly. The movie deserved a helluva lot more on DVD. Listen to the music as you watch the film. It rocks.
3,Robocop meets Robocop II,"Robocop is out to stop a drug-baron who, after being killed, returns to haunt the former as Robocop Mark 2, courtesy of a ruthless city administration milking every penny they can as the working-class of the city go under.Though this is indeed a mean-spirited film, it is not intended as escapism fantasy but more of a look into the future of a crumbling society. The scenes in which Robocop still harbours loss at the fact he'll nver be able to rejoin his family are very effective and the OCP chairman is revealed as the cold, self-serving individual he was formerly hinted as being.The only problems are that there is already enough blood and gore in real life to satisfy the ghouls who delight in such things. And the film suffers from far too much padding later on. Not a terrible film, as it has some good moments, but you can't help feeling it could have been a lot better and compared to the first film it's just movie junkfood."
2,Different than the first,"This one does not look like a grownup superhero atmospere film, instead it looks like a teenage superhero film. This one does not share anything in common with the first & niether do the characters, but the suit Peter Weller wears in this does."
3,A unconsiquential desire for Art.,"Although modern body piercing is not considered an art form, this book leaves nothing to the mind when it comes to the distinction of art and pornography. I simply think this book could be little more tasteful, but it does reveal the modern art form of bod-mod. I think that it is possible for us to modify our bodies to express ourelves, but I think genital piercings go little bit into the extreme. How is that expression when so few people will see that anyway."
1,Superficial,"I couldn't agree less with the other reviews. Tons of navel piercings (which already says a lot). Right away, most pictures (not all) look like the models are professional models, which bothered me a great deal. In fact the images could make their way to glossy fashion magazines. My advice would be to get some such magazines and not this book. And if you would get this book for the ""piercing"" then there is much better to get as well, as most piercings featured are middle of the road, fashionable ones, not too creative at all (like in ""bad art"").The techniqual quality of the photos is irreprocheable, but to sum it up there is little or no content.Sorry to hear that piercing professionals use this book (hard to believe actually, unless your clientèle needs to be convinced that piercings can be fashionable - and don't you have a portfolio to show?)"
2,Not what I was hopeing for,"If you are looking for a book that will help you with piercing, this is not it. The body art was nice, but lacked alot variety. Good book for coffee table art! Not a informational book if you want to know how its done or what it takes."
1,dumb,"dont get me wrong..the photography in the book is great but the only piercings featured are navels and eyebrows and nipples and pretty much any other super commen boring piercings..if you are interested in basic, run of the mill piercings then this book is great. however, if you are looking for something a bit more extreme, do not waste your time on this book."
5,what a read,I SAT DOWN WITH A CUP OF TEA AND DECIDED TO HAVE A LOOK THROUGH THIS BOOK BEFORE I GAVE IT TO MY HUSBAND FOR A PRESENT.EVERY PAGE HAD AN INTERESTING FACT ON IT AND BEFORE MY HUSBAND GOT IT IT WAS SECOND HAND AS I HAD READ IT FROM COVER TO COVER.I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT EDITION.
4,Ripley's Special Edition 2007,"Full of exciting information that holds a young person's interest. My son, age 10, would like to have seen more facts about each topic in the book. Most interesting sections were Weird World and Amazing Escapes."
3,"This is much more ""newage"" than ""world"".","""Native trance"" is similar to but not as intense or dance driven as Sacred Spirits or Spirit Nation. Despite it's name it is not a Native American trance/techno cd like Medicine Drum either.Although bearing *some* resemblences to Douglas Spotted Eagle this is very contemporary instrumental music with a very newage but not ambient style (e.g. It isn't deep, dreamy or etherial). The thing is, one can't tell right away that it's nessicarily Native American inspired music except from the flutes maybe. Really, it could incoorperate any culture into the music and still sound pretty much the same. It's great backround music as I find it quite easy to tune out since it is very subdued and light. There isn't a whole lot of emotion or ""soul"" to the music so don't expect it to ""move"" you much like Spirit Nation would.Although this album is far from bad or clumsy, there isn't anything about it that really stands out."
5,Love their music,"Great CD. I am a fan of Stonecoat so am familiar with their style and although some of it is repetitive from a previous album, that's OK with me."
5,Great TV Comedy Series,Fans of the TV show will love this video of the 5th Season...collect them all...let the mayhem begin again & again
4,What a great way to introduce young children to oldies!,"I ran across this recording in an obscure music catalog and, since my children were ready for something more than Raffi, I ordered it. They loved it! We spent many trip hours in the car singing along at full volume. It was the best holiday present they got that year and eight years later (even though the children are now teens who shop in the alternate section of the music store) we still bring it along on vacations which require automobile travel. This is definitely a must-have classic for kids."
5,Silly dance and sing music,My husband and I remember these songs when we were kids and found it fun and funny to share with our granddaughter. It is amazing to listen to a two year old sing the witch doctor and purple people eater and jump and dance to the music.Lots of fun and memories.
3,Silly but funny,"A lot of the tunes were duplicates of the Dumb Ditties series of songs, but a few different ones that we'd forgotten about."
4,Pretty good cd,This cd is pretty good in it includes some good and hard to find funny songs. They are not the original singers though which makes some of the songs much less enjoyable - just not sung very well. Overall though this cd is pretty good and worth buying.
1,fake recordings,this is on re-bop why do you think they call their record compy re-bop well they threw out the recordings that made the songs a hit of couse witch doctor was writenand sung by ross bagdasarian sr. who died at age 52. these recordings are all newand amazon should drop the price on it. it should cost much less than 14.99 .
2,"THE ""NAME GAME"" BELONGS IN THE TOILET","Ever since I was 3, I have had a constitutional aversion for the ""Name Game."" Whenever I heard this idiotic piece, I would flee from wherever I happened to be because I just could not tolerate it. ""Name Game"" is irritating, stupid, annoying and has nothing in creation to recommend it. I feel the same way about that stupid chewing gum on the bedpost song.I would have rated this one 4 stars, but including those two monstrosities cost this cd points."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"I did my research before purchasing this product but did not listen to the warnings. I read that it gave many people the instant ""runs"", but having a self diagnosed ""strong stomach"" I thought they were just weenies and that I would be immune to these effects. Might I add that I have competed in natural bodybuilding shows for about 8 years and am used to taking all kinds of supplements. The first time I took it, about twenty minutes afterwards I had to run to the restroom! No Joke... Being the stubborn man that I am, I thought it must had been something else I ate and tried it for my next session. I am a true believer in not giving into the negative hype until I am convinced. I used it for an entire week and 5 out of 6 days, I had to make an emergency bathroom run! As a personal trainer with a degree in exercise science and years of bodybuilding experience I highly recommend you try something other than this product."
4,Decent Motivator,"I've tried hydroxycut, NO Explode, Redline and Blast Cycle. Blast Cycle works the best of the four. Two servings get me into the ""zone"". I usually lay off this stuff and use it when I need motivation. When I was deployed I used this stuff religiously every day. I saw big improvements. My fellow soldiers noticed the difference and when I came home and took off my shirt, a chick said, ""Wow."" Can't beat that for a reaction."
2,Too hard to navigate,I have about 200 games in my collection and I'll have to say that this is one of the most difficult to play. I have the old Splinter Cell games and enjoyed them very much but this is a whole different animal. I played this like I normally would by starting on level 2 but after a frustrating 2 missions started over on EASY. It didn't get much better so after 3 missions I turned to another game. I gave this a 2 only for the story and will try it again but only if I find myself in a situation where I have only this game to play and possibly a few hundred hours to burn up.
2,A very poor addition to the series.,"I absolutely loved the older Splinter Cell games on my old Xbox. I was really looking forward to playing this newer one on the more advanced PS3, but was sorely disappointed. No part of it lived up to the standard set by the previous games. I'm very unhappy with the story, the controls and the visual look of this game. So sad."
3,Good Game Nice Price,For the price it was a good game. It came in good condition and was a little easier than most of the other Splinter Cell Games.
1,Stay away,"I just recently bought the Splinter Cell Hd Collection and started replaying the older ones...which was very excellent. So I decided alright Ill get the next one Double Agent! I got it...I sure got it. and Let me tell you this... No Light and Dark bar or ""seen or hidden"" infact it barely plays as a splinter cell games...at all. This thing was a gaint BOMB. Why they redid the entire system for the newer one..which wasn't really splinter cell either. Stay away..especially away from the PS3 version...believe or not better to get on PS2 Xbox360 or Xbox..but I wouldn't suggest getting it AT ALL."
3,Another review,"Well, I beat the game in Easy mode and I gotta gree with load time and crappy framerate. I would rather tone down the graphics and have a smooth gameplay and no, my PS3 is not old.I have played previous splinter cell games, including 1 on xbox and I gotta admit that I'm a little dissapointed with graphics.I also dont like camera and especially controls in water when it takes forever to swim up and get to the surface if you dont aim for it from the bottom.Lets take a look at fun factor. I like how you can pick what you want to do in the game. You can be a good guy and do things that are only required by terrorists or you can go all out and be ruthless killer.Overall the game is alright."
2,"A stock filler, but not MGS4 stuff...","If you've got some time to kill, get this copy or any other game. I am not too impressed to recommend this to others anyway."
1,BAD!!!not in a good way,Worst wrestling ever. I would expect more from the title but looks can be deceiving.WWE is more hardcore and thats pretty bad. I do not like a single match on here it is just plain out garbage. I do not recommend. If u want 2 see hardcore get czw or backyard wrestling
4,pretty good?,"this book was very easy to read and had really good tips on taking the tests -- especially the essay portion. :)i got a 4, which was pretty good since i actually only started studying for the test two weeks before! the test isn't scary, trust me. just try not to procrastinate and cram at the last minute and you'd probably do good."
2,Who's Story?,"CNN's Walter Rodgers was imbedded in our unit and I'm very disappointed with CNN's efforts. There was very little footage from 3-7 CAV and the story does not tell of the Army's or Marine Corps' great successes. Would not recommend this for any vet of the war, especially those who served with 3ID."
1,Absurdly Reported Trash,"If you want political commentary, turn on the daily liberal diatribe from CNN. Don't buy this trash!!!!!!"
1,Anti-Americanism...CNN style,"A heavy-handed dose of civilian casualties, cynical skeptics and military mishaps. It's amazing how one story can be retold in so many different versions. From the Arab press to the socialist press to the right wing press...who the hell knows what really happens in the world?If you're looking for a document of what happend on the road to Baghdad, don't look to this piece of anti-American propaganda. According to CNN it's our fault that everyone hates us and we can't even tie our own shoelaces.Highly disappointed."
5,Does what it's suppose to do.,"This little gadget fits in areas where I couldnt use my full size bolt cutter.I've already used it 3 times since I bought it. I was able to cut the nails holding an oldelectrical receptacle connected to the studs. (so I could replace it with an updated one)The nails were the std 4"" type. As long as the wire or bolt you want to cut is small enough to fit in between thejaws, this will take care of it in a snap ;)."
4,Ring of Honor vs All Japan pro Wrestling,"This is a great show and features a series of matches pitting ROH vs AJPW. Match ups like Homicide vs Satoshi Kojima, Aj Styles vs Kaz Hayashi, and Great Muta and Arashi vs The Prophecy ( Chris Daniels and Dan Maff) are all enjoyable and entertaining. There is some really good storytelling in these matches and CM Punk on commentary is both insightful and hilarious. Not to mention Punk wrestles in a tag match! Recommended purchase!"
1,Too Flimsy,I bought this book as a gift for my [...] year old nephew. He is totally into cars so I thought it would be perfect for him. When I received it from Amazon the pieces were already breaking off and the cellophane cover was broken. This book is designed to be like a model when you turn the page part of the model comes off and you can see underneath. The problem is that it is attached with very flimsy thin plastic that snaps off VERY easily. I don't think it will hold up for more than one or two readings ESPECIALLY if you are trying to use it with younger readers. NOT SAFE for children under 3.
1,ASSIGNMENTS' REVIEW,"THE BOOK ""ASSIGNMENT RESCUE"" IS A LONG AND BORNING BOOK. IT DOES NOT ILLUSTRATE THE CHARACTERS VERY WELL. IT HAS GOOD DETAILS THAT MAKE THE BOOK LONGER AND BORNING. THE BOOK BASICALY GOES STEP BY STEP WITH MR. FRY'S ASSIGNMENT. ALTHOUGH THIS IS A TRUE STORY, IT HAS NO EXCITEMENT JUST DETAIL. THE WORDING IN THIS IS TO ADVANCED FOR MOST PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF FIFTEEN. SO, I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS BOOD FOR PEOPLE UNDER FIFTEEN."
5,TOO GOOD TO BE BAD,"WELL I'VE BEEN A CRUCIAL CONFLICT FAN SINCE ""THE FINAL TIC"" HOWEVER THIS ALBUM""GOOD SIDE BAD SIDE"" IS BETTER . THEY REALLY SHOW THEIR TALENT AND FIRST IT WAS HAY NOW SCUMY THEY KNOW WHAT HITS TO PUT OUT TO ATTRACT A GOOD HAPPY AUDIENCE LIKE SISCKEL AND EBERT I GIVE THIS ALBUM TWO THUMBS UP. !!!THEIR REALLY PUTTING CHICAGO ON THE MAP !!"
4,ALMIGHTY AMBROSE*,"THIS CD BRINGS YOU TO THE DEPTHS OF CHI-TOWN STREETS.CRUCIAL CONFLICT BLOWS B.O.N.E. OUT THE BOX.THE GOOD TRACKS ARE NUMBERS,2,3,5,7,8,9,12,14,.ALLS WELL PEOPLES."
4,Excellent,"I found this collection of essays to be outstanding, yet depressing - outstanding because of the author's scintilating portraits of the people he writes about and depressing because of most of the people he writes about were clearly as awful as they were arrogant.Additionally, his essay on biographies of the 'Bloomsbury' group changed the way I look at literary biographies generally - the reason for reading an author's bio is to enhance your understanding of their works, not to readgossip about someone who may now be ignored as an author, but who has become 'famous for being famous'."
1,Tedious collection of disjointed critical essays,"This book is not what it is advertised to be. I was very interested in the premise, so I struggled through it, but be cautioned that it is in fact a series of critical essays about intellectuals and their writings about other intellectuals and their writings, ad nauseum. If you read it all, you will get some sense of the enduring political naivete of these people (and their successors), but it is a painful and mostly unproductive exercise."
1,Consistent mechanical failure of caller history button.,"I have had 2 iterations of their phones w/ at least 6 handsets. ALL had the same failure...the history button on the handset breaks shortly after purchase. I have contacted Uniden, but I got no reply as to either a fix or a plan to fix this problem.Unless or until they address this failure, I would not buy this phone...if caller history...including redialing a number from the history, is important to you. The corded base unit still has the button working, but not one of the handsets is still working...and they are very gently used."
1,Not compatible with the TRU8866 base station,"I contacted Uniden for a compatible handset for my TRU8866 base station, and was told the TCX905 is the new handset. Well, it won't seat in the base station to register, nor will it seat in the TCX860 handset chargers. Yet, the TCX860 handset will seat properly in the TCX905 charger.I've contacted Uniden for an explanation that I am sure I won't like.The TRU8866 has been an excellent system. When I had to get replacement batteries for the TCX860s, I bought Duracells at K-Mart at a great price, and they have a better charge than the Uniden batteries.I am really disappointed. I'd settle for a refurb TCX860. I have 8 handsets, and wanted to add 2 more. I do not look forward to replacing the base station and buying 9 new handsets. Not good. Any suggestions on brands would be appreciated."
4,Simple solution to handset registration,"We've had a Uniden phone for a few years now and are very happy with it. We decided to replace two other Panasonic phones with extra Uniden handsets. The handsets were a newer model and didn't fit into the base so I tried to register them following the instructions. That didn't work. After a few frustrating attempts, I removed the battery cover on the handsets so they could fit into the base and register automatically. They work great now, the sound quality is excellent and we love the intercom feature."
2,"Good, then BAD","I have three of these handsets. All had the same failure - the function key in the center went bad. I can't access the phone book, check caller ID history or change any options. It still works OK as a simple phone. Uniden replaced the one unit that failed under warranty. And the replacement then had the same failure."
2,soft ware does not recognize the handset,I downloaded the software disc that came with the phone clx485. I then connected the handset via usb and the software could not detect the handset. useless
4,"Good phone, works great with the 8866 base unit","It supports 2 line operation, which isn't mentioned much in most product specs, but the interface for working with voicemail is weaker than in the original 8866 handsets (you have to use the menu instead of having a dedicated button).Also, the center round ""rocking arrow"" button, is just terribly executed. Could have been so much better.Still, it works fine for an inexpensive extra 2 line handset for an 8866 base."
2,Good Phone for About a Year,"I have a Uniden system with 6 of these phones. We have had it for several years. The phones have been great with the exception of poor duability of the center navigation button. Without fail, the switch will fail to access the various functions. This usually happens just after the warranty expires. I have taken one of the phones apart. It could be fixed easily if Uniden would send me the part. They won't. I have replaced 5 of the 6 handsets. If these fail, I'll purchase a different brand."
3,Least expensive two line cordless BUT,This is not a bad phone the only problem is that the rocker which you use to get caller ID list Phone Book and volume dies and so since it is the least expensive of the 2 line cordless phones I am replacing some of the handsets.
4,Good value,"Excellent value. I ordered multiple handsets. Shipping was quick, product was in good shape and everything went smooth."
5,uniden phone,phone works great. reception is very good. all the stations do there job well. one improvement would be to allow speed dail drom stations as well as base unit
4,Great cordless Phone,Uniden continues to deliver great phones. This model has a large phone book memory and easy to navigate menus for different phone functions. It has good range is easy to set up. The only feature I can find that Uniden could have added is an alarm clock. This phone is worth the money and I highly recommend it.
2,Uniden cordless phone,"The phone has nice features, but has flaws. I purchased a base unit and a total of three phones. All three handsets frequently lose incoming sound volume. The handset purchased separately as the 3rd set is the worst in this regard. If you give it a solid rap on a hard surface, the sound volume returns to normal. I do not recommend this phone."
3,I expected it to be better!,"I ordered several of these phones last month to work with a base unit made by Uniden, as well. I have already returned 1 because it did not Work when I pushed the buttons on it."
4,Great product,We purchased three of these to go with the two we had. We are very happy with the performance of these but wish the feature set was just a bit more intuitive.
3,Phone,I liked it very much. I don't like the requiement the I need to have a number of words to complete this review. Pain in the but.
5,nice,They worked fine for me while we had a home phone. We have since cut the home phone off and just use cell phones. We used these for a good while and they always worked fine.
3,Good phone but doesn't last long,"Overall phone worked well. Good range, nice feel, decent quality. Purchased four of them in February of 2007. By November of 2007 three out of four had problems. The middle ""4-way"" button stopped working. Otherwise it's fairly decent. It's irritating that all of them except one developed the same problem. It is like the menu button got worn out (and I don't receive that many calls). If you use the phone book or the caller id feature a lot, then skip this phone. The warranty information for Uniden says I can send them back for service, but then I have to be without phones for however long it takes and pay $10 per phone (so that's another $30 out of my pocket.) There should be no charge when it is a manufacturer problem."
5,They just keep going,"Bought the base in 2004, this was an add on in about 2006.2006 version harder to program than first version.All are amazing quality for work environment and never a single problem. Changed the batteries and they work even better.Use them about 3 hours each day, sometimes 8 hours a day.Always with a headset, except sometimes with speakerphone which actually works surprisingly well.Best phone I've ever had and I tried 4 and returned them before staying with Uniden 2 line phone system.I recommend them all the time."
4,Good 2 line add on for the price.,I've had a had my Uniden TRU8866 for a few years but stopped using it since people complained about not being able to hear with a headphone. Decided to take the risk on these extension handsets to see if that would resolve the issue. These sound much better and I'm happy to be able to have only one handset for both lines in each room now. Message indicator works with Telco voice mail too. (Why is that such a hard feature to find these days?)
3,Ordered 3 phones with 2 line capability. 2 were correct and work fine. The third phone has only one line capability and I cannot,Uniden TCX905 Accessory Handset and Charger with Call Waiting and Caller IDbought 3 phones and two are ok with 2 lines as expected. third phone is only one line----i cannot use it.
4,UNIDEN TCX905 Accessory Handset,Good price for a good accessory. UNIDEN needs to improve the system they use to imprint the numbers on the dial-up buttons; they wear off too quickly.
2,Disappointed,We've owned older Uniden models and were always happy w/their product. Unfortunately we've been experienceing problems with this phone system. Poor connectivity and one of the phones has poor volumn
4,Uniden TCX905 Cordless Phone,I bought this phone as an extention of 3 that I had already had. I really like this phone set. I like the range of these phones and the display. Real good phones.
3,It does the job!!!,"Battery died again. So had to toss it. It must have lasted about 18 months.My original review:The single cordless extension that came with this original base was not giving enough talk time so I bought this one. I have not had low battery sign on both my extensions so I guess it solved my problem. Registering it was simple and quick. Just like my other unit this one does not pick up the name from address book when an incoming call comes, hence 4 *s."
5,Great phone,These were added to an existing Uniden system and I am very satisfied with the brand and individual phones. There is no interference and range is good at least 75 feet from base before signal deteriorates.I recommend these as a low cost great performing phone.
1,Horrrible Phone,This phone worked fine for over a year but recently is making problems. The phone presses buttons on its own and meanwhile I can't press any buttons. For instance it will start dialing numbers or put on speaker and then take off speaker. It even once hung up the phone while I was in the midst of a conversation.
3,Great phone,I gave 3 stars b/c I am having trouble with my phone. The sound dims out and comes back whenever it wants. It has had this problem since purchase. I had one previous to that and never had any problems with it until I left it on top of my car and drove away! They do have a year warranty though which is a plus!
3,fair phone,"This is a good phone in most respects, solid build, good feature set, however, this phone as well as the waterproof version have very poor muffled sound quality from the earpiece. If the sound quality was good, which I consider important, it would get a 5."
4,Great for 2 lines---additional handsets,I have an older TRU8 series base with 2 handsets. These were additional handsets and work great. After quite a bit of research---this is one of the few systems out there that can handle 2 lines. Both the older original purchase and these new handsets work great. I was worried about compatibility but they programmed easily. Good product.
4,Good product,Works well with good range and clarity. Keys on handset difficult to read even when backlit.
4,Still rating highly overall - In spite of two lemons,"I see raving reviews here. I've had a long relationship with these phones and I rate them highly but realistically as well. I really like the system I have overall. The capabilities and feel of these phones are excellent.Even so, I've had 2 of 5 of these 905's that have been duds. One was just not good at all and the second was ""quirky"" in that it freezes up fairly frequently until I pull and reattach the battery.I just bought 3 more of these so I'm still a fan in spite of those challenges and you can see my rating. I've looked hard and I couldn't find any competing phone that impressed me at all. That's the core of my message here. These phones aren't perfect but I think they're a solid value for the price."
3,replacing my phone,"Replacing two phones was easy. I think both of my phones were dropped and wasn't able to hear the other party. It would faye in and out. So far, replacing the two phones is working fine."
3,Great Product However....,"These handsets are great however, after 1 year the joystick like button in the middle stopped working. This happened to both my phones. You need that button to recall numbers that you don't have memorized. I will order two more only because I can't find a system that compares to this one. Uniden please improve that feature!!!!"
4,Excellent Overall with a hard-to-find feature,"Because I often work evenings, I like the ""Do Not Disturb"" feature of this set. One button on the base unit turns off the ringer on the base, as well as all handsets. Incomming calls silently go straight to voice mail. Very few phone sets have this feature. Regarding durability, after about 4 years, the multi-function button, used for caller id review, etc. became *very* difficult to use. Also, my wife uses a headset very often. After many plug/unplug cycles, the headset jack has worn so that when you unplug the headset, the normal ear-pieece speaker doesn't always turn back on. The corded phone in the base unit gives you a usable phone even when the power is out, although the answering machine function doesn't work. Sound quality is excellent. I highly recommend this phone set."
2,Caller ID/Phonebook Button Defective,"I purchased a system that included four of these handsets. Within a year, the caller ID/phonebook button stopped working properly on all four handsets. Either it doesn't work at all, or I have to press extremely hard on it to get it to work. Without a doubt, there is a design problem with these handsets. The range is also not very impressive."
4,Uniden 2-Line Cordless,"This 2-Line phone has been around for a long time. I have had to REPLACE 4 cordless phones, all for the same reason: The silver 4-way function located on the phone's center slowly fails over time and eventually becomes inoperative. This process begins when more and more pressure (over many months) is required to make the 4-way function button operate. Meanwhile, all the other buttons on the unit continue to work normally.I have have had to replace each cordless unit (to date 4 of them) when I can no longer search for caller ID's or make changes to the phone's menu lists (i,e, setups) etc., although the unit remains functioning as a simple telephone with setups fixed and non-changeable, i.e volume.I discovered that this deterioration is a design problem and not user-caused."
2,Great features but ONE consistent problem,"I love the features of this phone. But like other reviewers have noted, the center button that accesses the stored phonebook and caller id stops working. This has happened with two phones after a little over a year each."
4,Good quality for Great Price,"After shopping many sites, this was the best bargain. Very pleased with the product and the service."
2,Not a good buy,I purchased a set and bought more to have all over the house. They lasted about one year before they wouldn't charge any longer. I find them to be clumsy to hold compared to other brands. I would not recommend these.
4,Good two line handset,"This handset worked as advertised. They are difficult to find so I was glad to get it. It has been in service for nearly a year and works perfectly. The screen is a bit hard to read, and the menu system a bit obscure. I use the two line feature regularly. The unit is normally left on the charging stand but it will remain functional for days off of the stand."
1,5 of them ALL USELESS - Just wait a couple years,"I bought 5 of these just about 2 years ago. Used normally, not abused at all, put back in the cradle when they needed to be charged.EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE NEEDS A NEW BATTERY IN ORDER TO FUNCTION. We're not talking battery life here folks -- the damn phones will not even work. They die 2 seconds after I pull them off the charger.So, if yours haven't crapped out -- give it time -- they will.Steer clear of these and all Uniden products. I know I will in the future."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed to find that the additional handset you recommended,tcx905, was significantly inferior to my system,tru9485. Specifically,it has no phonebook accessibilty."
4,Phone,"Great seller, great product and a great bargain even after buying a new battery. Would buy again"
4,works great,"I had a problem syncing it with my base, but after I called tech support and they helped me, its been perfect."
3,Cordless Phone,"This is the second shipment of this phone and we are still having issues with the phone not charging on its port. I don't know if it is the phone's problems or if I ordered the wrong phone for the set up I have at home. If I unplug the battery and then plug it back up, it works fine until the battery dies, then we have to charge and reboot the phone each time by removing the battery and plugging it back in."
5,Great phones for the price!!!,"I got four of these phones for Christmas 2006 and recently added two more handsets for a total of six. I have VoIP and have found it difficult to find phones that worked well with it. These phones work great. One of the features I like is that you can program the name of the room on each handset (i.e. office, kitchen, master bed, family room) so you know where each phone should go when you need to place it back on its charger. The paging system works great with this as well. You no longer have to page a handset number. Each handset recognizes the other handsets name. You will not regret purchasing these phones."
2,unclear reception,"I have an older Uniden cordless with accessory handsets which, in the same location, gave perfectly clear reception. This one has trouble around walls!"
4,A marvelous tenor singing voice and english language diction,"Harry Secombe has a marvelous tenor singing voice. Most impressive is his command of english language diction and ennunciation. His style is direct and simple. If you are used to hearing songs such as ""Onward, Christian Soldiers"" sung so that the words cannot be understood, you are in for a very pleasant surprise. His rendition of ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"", a difficult piece, is superb. His voice seems less suited to the operatic medium, but his offerings are still worthwhile."
1,Not good,"It didn`t work as soon as my son try to play with it, we change bateries and didn`t work anyway."
4,recommend for siblings of children with autism,I also read this book with my daughter. I found it really helpful for the both of us. Some of the suggestions she has taken to heart and has started to practice them with her brother who is high function autisic.I would reccemond this to anybody who has other children that needs to uderstand about what autism is and can learn about different ways to do things
4,Everybody is different: A book for young people who have brothers or sisters with Autism,"This book is quite good and explains quite easily to older children, the concept and behaviours of Autism. I think it was a little over the understanding of my 8 year old, but my 12 year old could quite easily gain a better understanding. It would be helpful to read it with your children so you canvdiscuss any siblings concerns, and troubleshooting methods for if you happen to be unavailable."
3,Not quite a child-friendly read,"I ordered this book for my nine-year-old nephew, who is starting to ask questions about his brother's behaviors. The book is short and the section headings are good. Overall, though, this book is not written in a way that is interesting to a child and the examples given are more adult-oriented than child-oriented. I hope we will continue to see books written for young siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder. In the meantime, this book is an okay jumping-off point for discussion."
5,Great info in kid language,This book is great at addressing the kinds of questions that come up for kids in a very kid-friendly way.
4,helpful,This book is a good way to explain some differences to the teenagers that may have a sybling or a relative that has Autism. It is easy to read and has good examples.
5,All for Matthew-,"My daugher is only 4yrs old so I had to read the book first and water it down. I was surprised by how much she already new about her 6yr. old brother. She said when she grew up she would help me take care of Matthew by giving him a drink, tucking him in bed and singing him a lulaby.She already does alot of talking for him when they meet people."
1,Connor's mom,"I did not care for this book. In the begining it goes on to explain how there is nothing you can do to fix autism and how it is just in the childs ""genes"". Some of the points were good, however I feel that this book is outdated.Autism is treatable, I have a son that is making great progress everyday with diet and nutritional products!"
4,Unknown voices from Heavens,"This is the Angelus Domini's Leone Leoni. Who knows him with his double lion's name? Listen that is to hear the joice of the hope, and better than a good preach."
4,Nice little bag,"This is a nice little bag that holds the two things most needed by the cameras that fit inside: extra batteries and extra memory cards. It's made of sturdy nylon, with a double clasp closure and a shoulder-length strap. The only thing I wish it had is a belt loop - hence four stars instead of five."
3,Not big enough for the Canon A720IS,This bag is undersized for the 720IS camera. It is a squeeze to get it in and difficult to get out. The mode wheel on the camera is turned by the friction of the bag when removing the camera.The construction is fine. Better for a smaller camera.
3,Camera bag,Bag is small and compact. Just big enough for camera and extra memory cards and batteries.
4,Bought for Canon Poswershot S100,"Initial impression is good with a good fit for the S100 (a notch too big). Not super stylish but very practical, enough space to put 4 SD cards and 3 to 4 NB-5L batteries in the front pocket without squeezing the camera. I also like the zipper keeping the battery/SD compartment secure and the convenient flip cap that has velcro and can also be clipped for safety. Also, the belt loop is sewed to the case so cannot be opened for easy setup but is more secure than some other velcro type loops."
5,Perfect for Fuji F550exr,"I bought this because it looked to be about the right size for my brand-new Fuji F550exr and I was right. I believe this case would be a good choice for other compact travel zoom cameras like the Sony hx9v or the Panasonic zs10, two other cameras that I had considered. The red case was a great deal too (selling for less than half the price of the other colors) and matches the Fuji color scheme (black & red). The case is very sturdy and the pocket perfect for an extra battery or memory cards. The strap is a little wider than most other compact camera cases which I found to be nice and it does come with a belt loop, although you have to thread your belt through it, it's not quick release. Tamrac apparently makes some of their products in the US, but I didn't find a country-of-origin label on the packaging or on the bag itself."
5,"I LOVE this album, I use in my interfaith virtues class, even while working!","I love this music, - each song is unique, upbeat and meaningful. Not just the usual blah blah blah. And the children in my interfaith virtues class love this music. We performed ""I think your wonderful"" at a Thansgiving service and the parents were all humming it at home afterwards. Fills your heart with GOOD feelings. Perfect for the times we live in."
2,Music,"Love the message...just not very impressed with the actual music. Unfortunately, it is rather dated."
3,Okay collection,"I bought this when it was released, and I would rate it at least 'okay'...it's just really a games collection, not much in the way of biography. Ward does a decent job examining the critical points of what he finds as the most interesting games, although many of the games include no annotations, just text. A lot of Morphy's games were more or less just crushes, since he was so far above most of his opponents, which makes it understandable why many games aren't annotated in such a short book.Amazingly, the best book containing annotations of all Morphy's known games is still probably Maroczy's, from 1908."
1,Poor Book,This book was a big disappointment. It appears to have been hastily assembled and pushed out the door. Annotations are poor in quality and quantity and a lot of games are not annotated at all. Binding fell apart. Not much thought went into it. The Valerie Biem book is way better.
2,Cleanser,"Bought the Cleanser but the seller had run out of the product. Received refund immediately. I use this product and it works wonderfully. I have used several facial cleansing products, ex Clinic, Neutragena, Dermatologica... I found this one which does the best."
5,Great Cleanser,"I love the Mary Kay Timewise 3-in-1. My skin feels clean after using it. I love the way this product lathers, unlike the normal to dry where you are not sure if your face is clean."
5,Must Have,"My skin is like butter after using this. I temporarily went back to my Proactiv routine and then to a new face wash by MK that had a toner in it. Still, this is my fave."
5,mary Kay saves my skin!,I'm never let down when it comes to Mary Kay products! Thanks for the great prices! My skin is already looking better.
4,Great all in 1,Great all in 1 option. Sometimes I still use freshner. Mary Kay is a name I trust. Glad I don't have to find a rep for area to find products.
4,the real thing,"it seems to be the real thing and just fine. the boxes have ""sampler"" and ""not for resale"" on them."
2,Pretty good but has some flaws,"The dialogue in the movie is pretty bad, but the fight scene at the end is fantastic-- excellent swordplay (very fast, with great foot work) between Patrick Swayze and Anthony Zerbe. This movie reminded me of The Road Warrior, only not as violent."
1,Steel Dawn - hit and miss,I can't really say I hated it because I couldn't view it. Once i put it in a message came up that said it could not be played in my DVD player. No explantation why. Had to return it.
1,Don't waste your time.,"The movie is a very routine,very boring, very low budget action movie. Nothing makes it special. Action sequences are unrealistic, obviously staged."
5,Steel Dawn,"One of the best flim that Patrick Swayee ever done and he""s done some good ones.This one has a lot of action and good fight in it . I collect a lot of movies and this one is to me the best next to the Magnificent Seven."
1,not happy,"I ordered this as a Christmas present and it was not what it stated in the description, after receiving and giving as a present it was brought to my attention that it would not play on the dvd player. It was stated in the description that it was region all, but would not play. The dvd player would not even recognize it as a dvd. I have tried to contact the seller by email and they will not respond to the problem. So my review is not going to be very goood. I will not purchase anything from them again."
5,"A great female villan ""If you can't find a friend, make one""","Only once in a great while does this happen in the horror movie genre. Generally women ""villans"" do not work. For most of my life none could surpass Carrie. That is until I watched this film. Angela Bettis (May) was brilliant as the lead role in this film. Jeremy Sisto was a wonderful addition to this cast. This movie was witty, charming, endearing and gross. You can't ask for much more than that. If you are aching to see a good woman ""villan"" you can really root for, I highly reccomend this film. It's one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long, long time."
5,forget what you have heard,"This movie is original, it has a clever metaphors in it, it is scary, it is well acted so why are there such diverse reviews: whilst some reviewers gave may 1 star just as many gave it 5 stars. The haters of this movie say that the ending is pradictable, ok maybe it is, but this movie does not strive to blow you away with its ending it is simply a documentation of a crazy womans life and how she became crazy. If you want a movie with a truly unpradictable ending see lost highway or molholland drive. ALL IN ALL MAY IS A GREAT HORRER WELL WORTH SEEING."
3,Not too bad to watch,"Angela Bettis plays a pretty good ""freak."" Her character is a strange one indeed. It starts out really slow. Then it starts to get somewhat interesting but it's choppy. Goes from one plot to another, unnecessary lesbian scenes, but you know what the final outcome will be.""May"" is a twisted, confused and ""totally out there"" young woman, mental wise.It's easy to realize why she ends up doing what she does. The gore is minimal. The plot, okay. If you're going to get this movie, get a good used one. Don't pay full price. Too many ads for other movies at the beginning. At least 6-7."
4,Cool movie!,"May was a good movie, about a girl who gets infatuated with different peoples body parts. So she murders all the people she likes and tries to make the perfect friend out of them. I enjoyed this movie alot."
5,''May'' DVD Review,"May is 93 Minute Horror/thriller movie, as Wes Craven Quotes it is: 'Startling Compelling & Truly Original' I don't want to Spoil it for anyone, its basically about a Girl MAY (Angela Bettis) who has no friends in her Life, and in the end she becomes Psychotic, there's a few scenes with ''Anna Faris'' other Special features are: 'Cast & Crew, Production commentary' ''International Trailer'' English and Spanish Subtitles. I think that fans of the 2002 ''Carrie'' or fans of good story plots in movies, should definitely check it out."
3,MAY BE!,A very intresting film to say the least. IT had a good script great acting and a nice creepy feel to it. Do not expect a lot of violence but enough to perk the film up. It more about the plot and not the violence. May is a disturbing young woman who does not have the best of social skills. Starting from her child hood and her mom. She gives her a doll to help substitute for friends. She keeps this doll all the way to adult hood. She talks to it as if it is a living breathing person. Her relationships are both hetrosexual and lesbian. She tries to find the one person to love her and only her and not just a one night stand. This moves May to make her own personal love from the parts of others. Do not expect a fast moving film but enough to keep your intrest. It done very well and has a good story line. It is worth checking out.
3,"Creative,Unique,Creepy,Its okay.","""May"" was a movie that was highly recommended to me because im such a huge horror movie fiend. After all the movies ive seen (ALOT of them) May really stands out as being in its own kinda genre. The movie was creey and all the conversations in the film were extrememly awkward which definitely adds to Mays whole plot and feeling. The movie wasnt as gory as I thought or was told it was, but it was still relly good. The movie is extremely creepy and odd but in a really good way. I recommend it but im sure most people out there wont like it,unless youre into indie horror films. But if youre looking for a gorefest youll be dissappointed. All in all though i liked it.I thought it was okay and definitely worth a watch."
4,Don't Mess With May!,"After being teased her whole life due to her mental slowness, etc. May not only gets a boyfriend, but gets back at those who have wronged her. It turns into a wicked, violent nightmare for the people who made her life miserable. May's shocking and bizarre ways of getting the ultimate revenge will have you on the edge of your seat! This movie is like a cross between ""Carrie"" and ""Fatal Attraction"" except she dosen't have telekinetic powers and dosen't boil rabbits! She displays the quiet, misfit, loner-type who is constantly teased side like in ""Carrie"" and an obsessive, violent, off-the-wall for her boyfriend side like in ""Fatal Attraction"". That's the best I can describe it."
4,You're a sicko if you like this movie,"I LOVE this movie!!!! Once in a while if you're lucky you will stumble upon a horror film that will have a lasting effect on you; one that will be with you long after it has ended. That is MAY in a nutshell. There is so much originality in this film it is completely unlike anything else you have ever seen. This one pushes the boundaries of horror filmmaking in every way possible but unlike some of its predecessors in the genre, the shock value here is done with such artistic subtlety that it sometimes feels less like a horror film and much more like the work of art of some unknown, unsung genius. This movie will surely become a ""classic"" in horror film circles and will leave you chilled to the bone and sick to your stomach in the best way possible!!"
4,Give May A Chance.,"May is not your everyday horror movie. In fact, I'm not so sure this should even be categorized as horror. Maybe it's a little bit horror, a little bit dark comedy and a little bit tragedy. Never heard of it? Me either until a few weeks ago. It came highly recommended and I'm here to do the same.Suffice it to say it's one of those movies with lesser known actors that achieves a very satisfying texture and feel that is unique unto itself. Watching a film and feeling like you haven't already seen it or at least parts of it in other films is a rarity. But May is one of those films. ""May"" affords the viewer a bizarre, yet sympathetic trip inside the life of a hopeless social handicapper and provides a few nervous laughs along the way. There are many exceptional individual performances to savor as well, a rarity in the horror genre. Give this one a chance. You won't be sorry."
5,Amazing!,"I absolutely loved this movie. I had seen the cover before while walking around in the movie rental place, but never actually thought to get it. It was New Year's Eve/Early Day when I actually sat down and watched it. It was strange, almost like watching a cult classic or something. But to try and understand the pain and lonliness that May felt towards the end of the film just made me cry. So, I would advise anyone that has thought of watching it, but has never gotten around to it, should definitely watch it. It was absolutely, 100%, purely AMAZING!"
2,Cut it out.,"I'm constantly searching for little seen, original flicks that have something more to offer than typical Hollywood fare. Being a fan of horror movies (and the fact that it is a necessity to watch one every night in Oct.) I was intrigued by MAY which showed up on a pay-per-view. It started off well enough, establishing wall flower weirdo May as an off-kilter character that isn't yet psychotic enough to not pity. The story eventually slides into the blood and shock zone as May's sanity unravels and her craziness comes to the surface. The end of the film is predictable and silly while trying to be disturbing and cool. Everyone involved is doing a decent job for an independant flick, however the plot in the second half mars what could've been a creepy character study. ONE HOUR PHOTO handled the reclusive, misunderstood creep angle with a tad more originality and compassion for it's central player. MAY on the other hand is irredeemable."
2,Uh......,"A girl that takes her most prized possesion, a porcelin doll in a glass case, to her job. Unfortunately, she volunteers to teach blind 1st graders. She tells the children not to touch, but.....This is May, a little girl who grew up to be a weird woman. She is repulsive, pathetic, and psychotic.Let me put it this way, this is a long movie, too long for the anti-climax. When she makes her human doll out of human parts, cool. When she digs out her own eye for the doll, cool. When the 'doll' comes to life and moves his arm? Aw c'mon now. It would have been better if she had just died next to this lifeless, stinky thing.I would not watch it again. The chick with the great legs was hot though. You know the legs that May admired too."
1,May be NOT!,"This film lacked all of the attributes of a good horror film. When I wasn't laughing at the inane dialogue and story line, I was in constant battle of pushing the off button on the remote.Yes, I'm sure the sociable May would attract many potential friends. Who wouldn't want to befriend an emaciated frazzle-haired psycho with tics? Exactly......Call me crazy, but if I saw this girl on a bench I would avoid her at all costs.It also missed its ultimate objective which was to stir empathy for the lonely May. If you want to see a good film that executes this masterly, I recommend ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"""
1,Horrible movie,"Ok I am into these kinds of movies but this one SUCKED!! it was to blah I mean it was just horrible I would not recomend this to anyone, BUT I will say that there was like one cool scene in the movie (hint).... temples."
2,May not,"Tediously slow `horror' story of strange girl with even stranger ideas about friendship. The girl, May, has a lazy eye and as a consequence grows up friendless and weirdly introverted.I have a low tolerance for horror movies that use physical defects for effect. The title character in MAY has ambloyopia, or `lazy eye', and that is used not only to explain her isolation as a child, but also her abnormal behavior as an adult. Hey, if you're different you're weird, and the weird are evil.So, I watched this one with a strong built in bias against it and nothing I saw caused me to change my mind. Thankfully it was not as violent as it might have been, and for an indie the acting was quite good, especially Angela Bettis in the title role. Not a movie I'd consider watching again, though."
2,"Gross, disturbed, twisted, and sick","I like Living Dead Dolls too, but this movie stunk. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the performances were very good. This is a really strange flick that really strange people, like May herself, will truly enjoy."
1,thumbs DOWN,"It is terrible that this movie has a place on Blockbuster shelves, that it is sold at the price it is sold. I have to admit that visually it is done very well.However, i would recommend only to people with mental issues like the character in the movie to watch this. it is beyond disturbing (even though i happen to be a horror fan myself- this is a bad joke).little addition: even the director of the movie says on the dvd commentary, that ""oh yeah, we wrote this dialogue 2 minutes before the shooting..haha.."" or, yeah, this is my cousin in this role, this is my dad's girlfriends' dolls"" etc. If you are not professional and create something just for money or to satisfy your mental illness, at least you should lie to the viewers that you tried to do something good.The actress's performance was exceptional though, so congratulations to her.thanks."
2,Sucks,Easy to stream within a few minutes but story line and movie quality was horrible. Had to fight to make my self watch the whole thing I wanted to turn it off but paid for it so had to finish it but the hole movie was horrible
4,A very disturbing film,"This film really got to me. I watch a lot of horror films, but this film, though not very gorey, really made me uncomfortable. Strange film."
4,"If you like horror films, see this movie","Just out on DVD is a small film that never made it out to the theaters past the indie circuits and small festivals. I almost want to say the movie is a black comedy and while you will laugh, you're left with thoughts of how disturbing it really is.This is a really good movie and anyone who likes horror films should not miss out on it. This movie is no where near the disturbing level of Audition from Takashi Miike, but ends up being along the same lines, so be forewarned."
4,"Good, and very wierd and crazy. i liked it","I saw this with my parents and i have to say that it was the most f'd up movie i have ever seen but in a good way. im always up for a wierd twisted movie, artsy kinda ones u know. my parents think that i am wierd for likeing it and they even yelled at me for looking it up. if u want to see a modern day twisted physco killer, see this movie.i really liked it. but be warned its not for everyone, unless u liked movies like ""the ring"" and a movie kalled ""wicked"" with julia stiles u may not like this. also its not for little kids, gorry . i give it a 4 becuase they could ahve given a bvetter background. i would buy it. hope this helps"
4,"May is this decades ""Carrie""","I'm a huge fan of horror movies, and the more gory, the better. May is one of those films, but it made me oddly uncomfortable. Watching the last 30 minutes of the film literally made me sick to my stomach and cringe. Building up that point is a marvelously acted film about lonely outcast May, played remarkably by Angela Bettis (Girl Interrupted, TV Carrie). Angelas perfect performance truly makes this film what it is. Starting off as a shy, awkward girl who only wants to have a date with Jeremy Sisto(Six Feet Under, Wrong Turn), then turning into a crazy, creepy lunatic, Angela makes us feel sorry for her and then be intrigued as to why she does the things she does. This makes the final 30 minutes all the more exciting, and sometimes unbearable to watch. Jeremy Sisto gives a strong performance as Mays object of desire, and Anna Faris(Scary Movie, The Hot Chick) turns in a likable performance as Mays lesbian co-worker. This film is the Carrie of the decade."
5,One of the best horror films around.,"Its such a shame that ""May"" didn't get much publicity but then again I'm glad that til this day its name stays underground much like that of the ""Donnie Darko"" types. Because this way May can be my little guilty pleasure.Immediately from the beggining the story is captivating when we see a young May struggling to fit in but is unsucessful. The movie jumps ahead to May as a young adult, you'll see that the socially abandoned little girl has grown into a quirky young woman. What most guys will like about the film is that May is that wierd girl who you think is cute but your apprehensive about approaching her, everyone knows someone who is kind of like May.I'm proud to say that I watch my DVD of May several times a week lol. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and gasp. You feel her emotions as she struggles, falls in love, breaks. One more thing to remember...Watch it ALONE...it has a much greater effect."
1,"Do not see this movie,","When I was listening to everyones top ten list, May was mentioned. I like horror flicks so I thought "" wow, a horror flick that has plot?"" As I watched this, i liked the character, May, who is a quiet, misunderstood girl who needs a companion. Well she starts getting freakier and sicker and by the end, it's stupid and gross. She is a terrible character, you don't like her anymore, plus, there is one scene that made me want to cut out my eyes(not that part, the other part.) don't listen to the cool art kids who say this is a great movie, go buy battle royale at ebay. That is a movie!!!!"
1,Warning,"I ended up not watching the film past the first minute or so because it is not a letterboxed presentation, as it should be, instead, the film squeezes to full-frame if you do not have a 16x9 television. This creates and off-kilter, headache inducing experience. I was not able to make any adjustment to my TV or my player that would do any good.Lions Gate should recall the disc and repress it so it can be watched on either type of television."
3,Crazy May,"Whoa! She's crazy! She seems all nice and normal but is really a psychotic killer! If you see her with a pair of scissors RUN! Lots of gore and violence. WARNING: Not your typical ""Lifetime Network"" female psycho thriller!"
3,I don't get it....,"i have to admit...this is not the worst movie i have ever seen. its alright, but much to long, and has a...well it has some what of a story...that kind of falls apart! about that last 30 minutes of this movie is gory (well more bloody than gory) and a little bit creepy. the rest of it is just drama and...wierd! i have no desire to watch it again but i would if i had to. if you are into the slow moving psycho movie, then you will probably like this movie. but the part where she cut out her eye made me sick! but the human doll (made out of human parts!) was very cool! put it was [unrealistic] how it came to life!"
1,"What, if any, was the point?","Oh, my. Another ""everyone-was-mean-to-her-so-she-became-a scissor-wielding-psychopath-who-cuts-people-up-to-make-a-life-size-doll"" movie. I'm so pleased I took the 98 minutes or so out of my life to watch this. Oh... and they threw in an old doll that mysteriously comes to life and carries a curse. What an original idea.The film falls somewhere between the tongue in cheek horror of John Waters and gore-fests for the sake of gore like ""The Hills Have Eyes"". I found myself watching, continually waiting for any kind of credible internal justification for the characters. Of course, the problem of writing characters that are cardboard cut-outs is that their best use is as recyclables in your bin.A very young Jeremy Sisto shambles his way through the role of the disdainful boyfriend, while Angela Bettis, as May, is sadly ineffective as the central character, whose descent into madness is Hollywood predictability exemplified.Don't bother. Give your dog a bath instead."
4,really good !!!!!!,Okay I rented this movie and Identity and watched both of them back to back May being the last movie...While Identity was good not scary but shocking I found myself liking May better....This movie just left a wierd impression on me...The character May is really bizarre and the movie itself is freaky...dont get me wrong it's not trippy...THe movie is easy to follow ....I recommend this to all serious horror fans I guarantee this movie will grab you and leave you with a funny feeling after the closing credits !!
5,BEAUTIFULLY DARK AND CREEPY!,"I LOVE this movie! The characters are well developed, I love all of them. The acting was superb! Especially Jeremy Sisto! He is HEAVEN! The whole feel of this movie is smooth and dark. Perfectly creepy. Very well done. Even down to the music, mainly Kelly & Kim Deal, and the breeders. The music flowed perfectly with what was going on in the movie, I love that. May also has the perfect balance of gore & storyline. It is mysterious and very dark, so watch at your own risk!"
2,MOVIE WITH NO PLOT,"Movie had you looking at too many possible plots--was it about her eye, her mother, her shyness, the boy/girl, or the doll."
4,Cute movie,"Very charming. I had seen the actress in the Woman first, so it was amazing to see her in a difference kind of role. and hilarious to see Sisto of Suburgatory with all the hair. Creepy, slow-paced, kinda sad, but overall a good experience."
5,Dark and Delightful,"I really like this movie:)I don't know, maybe it's just me and my sick little mindbut I actually enjoyed it.I remember seeing it before a while back not remembering much of it.May is awesome, I really liked her character.The best part was when she took her mother advice LITERALLY,I wasn't expecting that. There was one part that sorta confused me.In the beginning they show her parents, but what ever happened to them?that's the part that really bugs me, I mean where they still alive or did they die or leave her....besides that, I can honestly say this movieis a must have"
5,Very original,I first saw this movie on tv and wow it's different. Angela Bettis is perfectly cast as the strange disturbed girl who just wants to be loved.What is good about this movie is that each scene has a purpose and flows. It gives you the creeps and but turns around and gives you some very dark humor as well. This is definitely one that slipped under the radar.
4,may,the movie is amazing. it's s wierd and it's fun. I recommend it for anyone who's a little morbid :P
2,Chilling story but dull movie,I bought this movie based on its exciting trailer. But I found the movie too slow untill everything happens at the end so fast. Its hard to belive that May can really kill five people so easily in one night and carry around their body parts in one lousy cooler. The movie makes its effort to keep things real in the begining and blows it badly at the end. The movie was definately a disappointment for me.
5,Crazy & Creepy,This is going to be a classic. Angela is a very convincing young actress. I recommend this movie to those who like something out of the norm.
3,Great Angela Bettis,"May is an adorable little girl in the body of an adult in a world of adults.Angela Bettis makes the movie. She's simply great. The story is kind of weird, the characters are kind of weirdos but with a reasonnable production, a good cast, it finally works very well. All the questions you could ask to yourself are not answered and it's a very good point. This is the perfect example that you don't need a bid budget to make an interesting and disturbing film. Angela Bettis is a future star without any doubt."
3,"""So much beautiful parts, no beautiful wholes""...","Please, rent the movie before you buy it in DVD, I'd say this movie is a ""one-time-worth-watching"" movie for cinema fans or for those who really like blood...I'd say the movie in itself can't be classified as an horror movie, there's nothing really scary it's just disgusting and choking scenes... Besides the first half of the movie is mainly comedy, it's reassuring to see someone even worse than me in human relationships!!!Anyway, it doesn't worth buying the DVD...PS: excuse my english!"
5,angela bettis rocks,"Talk about a good horror movie. This is not your typical hollywood movie folks. No hollywood-esque chilling sounds here, just whispery quiet and it works big time!! It's funny and chilling at the same time. Not as scary as The Ring but highly recommended. The actress who played ""May"", Angela Bettis probably gave one of the best performances in a horror movie for an actress in quite awhile...probably since Sissy Spacek in Carrie. This Angela Bettis can really act!"
4,A TRUE HORROR MASTERPIECE,"May is the story of a pretty, but deeply disturbed girl who's lived an outcast her whole life. Finally she meets someone, but he's soon to learn just how unlike other girls she is. See, May's ideas of love and friendship don't necessarily involve the whole person. Angela Bettis's performance is absolutely flawless. May is a lunatic you can't help but be sympathetic to, no matter how far she goes to try to be happy.This is one of the most twisted and brilliant horror pictures to come along in quite a while. Director Lucky McGee knows how to build and keep the intensity. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing a REAL horror film. May has some wicked humor but thankfully spares us the all too common cheese. Be careful if you're squeamish. It could have you poking your eye out so as not to see!Sleepers are the best, aren't they."
2,Oh please! 2nd round,"once again after reading the rest of the reviews I am shocked at people thoughts. Scariest of all time???? U have to be kidding! Granted the movie could have been great and Angela Bettis gets 5 STARS cause she acted her (skinny little) booty off in what could have been an award winning performance in a better movie. why make a movie that could have been so deep comical and almost unbearable to watch the 1st 2 3rds of the movie?? The shocking, nauseating gore (which i loved hehehe) at the end couldnt make up for it. Very upset after waiting so long to see it but lets hope Bettis's agents get this wonderful actress some a good rolePS WHAT HAPPENED TO HER PARENTS!!"
4,Very creepy,"This movie kinda sneaks up on you. It's scary without all the bells and whistles (which I prefer!) Rent it or buy it, but if you love scary suspensful movies, you HAVE to see it!"
2,NEEDS SOME WORK,"May is not what i expected it had too much gore, enough to really make you sick. I liked the beginning and then it kind of confused me at the end. But i would recommend this movie to anyone who loves gore. I gave it two stars, hope you enjoy."
2,Unworthy,"I did not appreciate the device of being addressed by the storyteller. I kept wanting to shout back, ""Stop talking to me and get on with the story!"". While there were several chunks that were deliciously engrossing, the ending falls painfully flat, completely unworthy of the time invested in the book."
1,"The Horror, The Horror","Michel Faber has great potential should he ever find a decent editor. This book could and should be cut in half...too many useless details that do nothing to add value. If one does persist long enough to get into the story, there are worthwhile moments...but don't do it! Not if you have a life. Anyone who tells you differently is a pretentious idiot. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed at the end of a book. Did I say ending? Whatever it was... Very phony intellectual stuff. It's like Faber got bored with his own blathering, had a deadline with the publisher and just said ""the end"" randomly. Luckily, I somehow had the goodluck to have taken this book out of the library and didn't pay a penny for it."
1,A waste of 900 pages,"This book was absolutely a waste of time. The author was long winded and didn't take the story anywhere. Save your money. Infact, the author needs to pay you to read it."
2,A review on 'Look Inside',"I got to know about this book from Time magazine,where it was described as a book 'better than ...' !And since then I am trying to know more about the book before I buy it.In the review section we get to know so many opinions which encourage as well as discourage at the same time.I went through the 'Look into' section provided here.And to be honest I felt sick reading even these few pages. I do agree with the opinion of P.A. Brown.May be its a great novel,but its like being pushed into a gutter filled of bodily fluids,sweat.."
1,I want my money back!,"Please, please don't waste your time with this dreadful bore. If you want something Dickensian read John Irving. If you want somthing that's long and barely comprehensible get Infinite Jest-- at least Wallace makes you think. Faber's tome will just put you to sleep."
1,Intellectually unstimulating and unchallenging,"This book was recommended by people who had not read this, but had read other historical novels I enjoyed such as, Versailles, Year of Wonders, Girl with a Pearl Earring, but I found nothing of the informative or educational element in it. I believe the largest and most frequently used word in the book is ""orifice."""
2,Hope the TV show is better,"Not impressed. Am half way through and waiting for it to make sense. Seems well researched but extremely depressing. Saw the previews for the television show based on the book. THAT looked interesting. Still, maybe the last half of the book will begin to make some sense. If you like graphic descriptions of abject poverty, Victorian London and sex you might enjoy this. I paid for this thing, guess I'll see it through."
2,Could have been better,this book was mildly interesting. It was hard to really connect with any of the characters and the plot seemed to drag out. Not something I would recommend to a friend.
3,It's OK,"Christ, read this book because according to Michel Faber's intro in Middle March (by George Eliot, highly highly recommended) some nutty critic praised this book by saying... a novel Charles Dickens and George Eliot would have written, if not for censore1ship... something crazy like that. How dare Michel Faber re-print that false-favorable-to-himself-review! Lol.While i knew, obviously, this book wouldn't come close to the likes of Dickens and Eliot, still i was expecting some kind of redeeming qualities, but alas there's none. It's not a bad book (Agnes was interesting, she's the most believable character out of 'em all) compare to other modern best sellers. But, overall, like so many of its kind, it fails to convince, among other things. And yeah, his tone doesn't help the story."
1,long read to poor ending,"THis is a long read, and while it was midly interesting , it looks like the author got writer's block about three quarters of the way through. The ending was very weak and dissatisfying after so much effert plowing through the rest of the book."
2,"Not a bad read, but an awful ending","I wasn't offended by the graphic sex or language- I just didn't like it. After I invested hundreds of pages in getting to know and trying to like these characters, the ending was truly awful- sensational, unrealistic, a cliff-hanger in which none of the possible outcomes is worth hoping for. The novel does a great job of showing the seamy underbelly of Victorian society, and the dirty little secrets of ""nice"" gentlemen, but is ultimately unfair to William (who is absolutely right to finally, reluctantly decide to have his wife institutionalized- she's a danger to herself and others)."
2,Vivid detail does not make a story,"There is no doubt that the author of this book will make you feel as if you are walking the streets of Victorian London. Every last smell, sound and visual image will flash before your eyes (this includes everything you never wanted to know about 19th century excretement, skin diseases, sewage, and contraceptive methods). The characters are enticing enough, and I found it easy to stay with the book waiting for all the details to come together to form a plot. It never really happened. It seems as if the author spent all available resources on researching and then showing off what he had learned about London society but never mapped out the course of the story. There is more fun to be had in the world of Dickens."
3,Disappointing ending,"Thoroughly enjoyed the book....but hated the ending. I do not like to be left hanging. The book was creatively written...but Mr. Faber, were you in a hurry to meet your deadline?"
2,So disappointing...,"I absolutely loved this book. I was hooked from the first few pages. I couldn't put it down. In fact, I stayed up very late one night to finish it because I just couldn't go to sleep without finding out what happened. Boy was that a mistake. How disappointing. I feel so cheated by the ending. It was so abrupt, I checked my book to make sure there were no pages missing. I am not a person who needs a neat and tidy ending, but come on! ANY ending would have been nice. Did his printer cartridge run out of ink or something?"
5,Such Memorable Characters!,"While I agree that this book might not be for everyone, it provides SUCH intense and vivid personalities. It really brings the reader into a sense of time and space (Victorian England) and captures the life of a young (and so shrewd and sarcastic!) prostitute. The language is fiercely detailed, descriptive and at times (for the prudish reader) offensive. Do not read this if you are a prude. Faber goes into great detail about the inner sexual thoughts of men.My favorite character is Agnes. She evokes sympathy, disgust, and she is just down right hilarious with her crazy delusions."
3,Not all it was cracked up to be,"After reading a number of favorable reviews, one claiming that Faber was ""reminiscent of Dickens"", I decided to give it a try. Faber is no Dickens. Faber did present a researched approach to nineteenth century England which was mildly entertaining - alhtough really why read an author writing about a historical period that has been so exhaustively written about already? -- Unlike Dickens the book was humourless... the morbid characters often lacked depth. The timing was off in places (could a young sentimental would-be author with no interest in his father's business really transform himself in one night into the contemptible business man he despises all after just one night with a prostitute?) And then magically within the year he has taken the reins of his once disaproving father's business? I didn't buy it... but the book did swing in to a nice page turner about 3/4 of the way through...alas all for a cheat of an oh-too-quick ending."
4,Outstanding novel with a few shortcomings,"This is a great read, the writing itself is fantastic, Faber's style alone kept the pages turning, particularly since I barely have the patience for 500+ page novels. The only real complaint that I do have--and the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars--is the ending; I like others felt cheated after having read the minute details of these characters' daily lives through 800 pages only to be left hanging so abruptly--never realizing the fates of the three primary characters: Sugar, Sophie, and William. It was somewhat anti-climactic but overall I was most thoroughly impressed with the writing style and the close attention paid to detail; you can't walk away without sensing or even knowing that Faber strove for nothing short of perfection in every paragraph, sentence, and word between the covers of The Crimson Petal and the White.If this were a movie a sequel would be expected, I can only hope for the same here."
2,A Neo-Victorian Crock,"The novel begins well, but by page 400 I had gotten sick of waiting for the story to get moving. The author just keeps hitting the reader over the head with the same information. By time I reached page 400, I looked back and realized that any proper Victorian novelist, or actually any proper novelist, would have accomplished in approximately 100 pages what it takes Faber over 400 pages to accomplish. I can't fault Mr. Faber on ambition, just on execution.Read some Dickens or some Trollope instead. They're faster, funnier, and far more interesting, to say nothing of being far less BORING, than Mr. Faber."
3,A good reading group choice.,"This book has been characterized by many as a 'Victorian' novel. However, while it takes place in Victorian times, the language is not for sensitive types. Prostitution is a major subject of the book, and is described in great detail. Faber has a nice writing style, with well-rounded characters, that make the 900-plus pages of this novel easy to read. Although I would not classify it as a 'Dickensian' novel, there is much to discuss with reading groups about the limited roles for women, double standards, class structure, etc."
3,I need more than this!,"A friend recommended this book to me. I loved most of the details and many of the characters. I felt as if I actually knew Sugar and William. Are they in love? I truly believed Sugar loved William, but that William carried nothing more than lust for Sugar.However, this story left me with too many unanswered questions. Was the dead body truly that of Agnes Rackham? Why was Henry even a part of this story at all? Where did Sugar take Sophie? How did they live? Were they ever caght? Too many ""what ifs"" for my taste.All in all, this book is just too long for the actual story being told. There is no closure with many of the characters. Nothing of much importance takes place until the last chapter and then the reader is left to imagination."
2,Suggestions for Readers,"This book is seriously overrated. It is way too long and the writing style is incredibly contrived and annoying for the reader.What the book is hailed for is its thorough description of the era. I agree that is well done but one does not need 800 pages to do that. I do not mind long books (in fact love them) if there is something (anything!) to hold my interest.Suggestions: 1) a book about a similar subject and time and much more interesting: Slammerkin by Emma Donoghue.2) a book with the same contrived writing style on the same subject and era, try The Dress Lodger by Sheri Holman."
4,Crimson Petal & the White,"This book was good, though I have to agree with the two main criticisms: a) There was a little too much gritty reality (farting, pooping, the consistency of spunk, etc.), and b) I felt as though the ending totally left me hanging.The story and the writing style had me hooked, though. I enjoyed this work as a modern take on the Victorian tale. I read it in only five days, which is not an easy task for an 800+ page book. I would recommend this book to those that I feel would appreciate historical fiction, but not to everybody I know. (As I would other books that I loved.)"
5,Stunning,"I read this author's Under the Skin last year and was blown away by the force and elasticity of the prose. What a writer! I recommended it to at least 10 people in my neighborhood. Now I have finished The Crimson Petal and the White and I can honestly state that it is the best novel I have read since Middlemarch - I couldn't stop reading at night, consequently I am suffering from acute sleep deprivation. I urge readers to buy this book quick before it sells out and ENJOY!"
2,too much spunk,"I hunkered down to read this blimp of a book with great expectations {(no)pun intended}. However, so many words and then pages turned out to be gratuitous. Somewhere in the process of putting so much down, the art of the thing was lost. The story and the characters became secondary to the graphics of bodily functions...Victorians went out of their way to create an illusion that such biological processes did not exist. It is like Faber is saying, ""Look, here I have a Victorian who ejaculates...And another who menustrates. This one has phlegm. Can you believe it?"" Victorians would have been shocked, scandalized, revolted. The only problem is that his audience is not a Victorian audience. These details are repeated and emphasized far too much. I had to call it quits at page 500 or so."
3,Badly digitized ebook?,"I haven't gotten far enough to review the book itself, but several times already the text has given me the impression that a passage of text was dropped during the process of creating the ebook.For example, from locations 1393-1406: ""Who can say how much this girl Sugar will cost? around Golden square contain a mixed assortment of houses, some grand, some shabby.""Clearly something got lost after the question mark."
2,"Long on pages, short on story and content","I took this novel on vacation so that I would have the time to read it from beginning to end. I should have had a back up read as well. I was initially interested in the narration of the first 100 or so pages. The narrator plays with and entices the reader; it was interesting. This made up for what was lacking in content. After that, all that remained was a rather boring, uninteresting, verbos accounts that concludes abruptly. I do not understand the hype surrounding this novel.Personally, I did not even think it was that ""sexual"" of a novel. Especially for have prostitutes as the protagonists! I would not recommend this work to any lover of literature."
1,Don't believe the hype,"Based upon the early word of mouth, I couldn't wait to read this book. Boy was I disappointed. The narrative style at the beginning of this book is awful. The beginning of the book has a narrator (that disappears in later chapters) that says things like, ""Look, there is person x enjoying a roll, but he is of no consequence, instead let us follow person y. See her walk down the street. Look, she is entering a building. Does she live here?"". Infuriating. Thankfully, the narrator goes away. Be warned though, the awful writing style continues. I can't say enough bad things about this book. I've sold my copy of this book, and I feel bad for inflicting its bulk on someone else. Run away!"
2,Way Too Long and Unexciting,"I am not attempting to be a literary critic, only to give my impression of this book. I found it to be long, tedious, and unexciting. I don't feel I ever got to know the characters, felt any compassion for any of them, and was left wondering why I had gone on with the book as long as I did."
1,"If you have insomnia, try reading this",I fell asleep trying to read this. An incredible amount of descriptive detail. Too much. I do not need an entire paragraph to tell me how uncomfortable a woman looks in her corset. I also do not need to know a person's entire life story if they are never appearing in the book again after page 30. I fell asleep everytime I picked it up. Thank goodness I did not take it to the tub with me. I would have drowned.
3,What happened to the ending?,"It seems like the author spent 800 pages talking endlessly about the same things and got so tired by the end that he decided to end the novel abruptly with no resolution at all. I don't mind novels without resolution, but this one really seems like some editor tore the last few chapters out of the book and left us with a publishing mistake. I hope that when they adapt this into a movie, supposedly with Kirsten Dunst in the lead, that they will give it some type of conclusion."
2,Long winded,"It goes on repetitiously for hundreds of pages with the same old same old -- crazy Agnes, religious zealot Henry and Mrs. Fox, Sugar spying, on and on ad nauseum. When it finally starts getting interesting, things start happening, it ends before anything does. A real disappointment."
3,Thoughts: (possible spoilers),"I just finished this book after a lengthy struggle. The only problem is, I'm not entirely certain that it was worth it. I did enjoy the story and the style in which it was written, but after a while I started to wonder what exactly the author wanted me to take away from it.The only thing I can think of is (and I know that this may make some of you roll your eyes) that love is the answer.If you think about it, that was the central motivation of nearly all the characters. All the main characters: Caroline, Sugar, Mrs Fox, Sophie, Agnes, William, and Henry - all of them are, essentially, alone. No one loves any of them. There were times when none of them even seemed capable of loving anyone.Only at the end, when Sugar abducts Sophie, does it seem like any of the characters has a hope of being happy - because she was acting out of love.Please comment: I am curious to see if anyone else shares my opinion."
3,Is That All There Is???????????,"It took me a little time to get into this book but after a few chapters I was hooked. I couldn't wait to join the characters each night to see what turn of events was in store. I finished the book last night only to say ""is that all there is"".....is there a sequal in the making???I found a ""short story"" on line Ferber wrote about a young Mrs. Fox...it took all of five or ten minutes to read but again I was left asking ""is that all there is""??I have recommended this book to several but will now tell some of them to spend their time on reading something else. I know they would be as disappointed as I was having invested time in a novel that leaves you hanging like the season's final episode of your favorite tv show!!I saw where this novel is going to be made into a movie....if it's like the book I'll wait until it comes to my local video store rather than invest the [money] to see it on the big screen!"
1,bleeeeeaaaaah!,"Worst. Book. Ever. The writing style is overly florid and most of the characters are just, well, jerks. The ending is ridiculous.And yet, I couldn't put it down, because I kept hoping it would get better. So that's why it gets one star, for the author's ability to trick me into thinking that this book was worth a week of my time.I can't believe how many ""best of"" lists this has been on...probably people who are secretly fond of the great works of Fabio."
1,Not Balzac.,"I bought this book because, frankly, I wondered if it contained any clues to the ambiguous ending of the TV drama.I'll never know because the author's mock-19th century style irritated me so much I never finished it."
2,boring,"Boring boring very very boring is the only way to describe this book. It repeats itself and drives me to sleep, which is quite a good thing as I only read in bed!"
2,Detail got in the way of the story,"Obviously a talented write, Michel Faber could have produced the classic that some reviewers have claimed, but he did not. It doesn't seem like he had an idea where he was going with this tedious tale. Faber repeats the error of some big book authors by letting his research get in the way of the story.The ending seems like he just lost interest; I certainly did."
3,Save yourself the time,"I was so disappointed with the ending of this book, and its failure to wrap up everything that was building up over its way-too-many pages, that it took away any appreciation that I had for the skillful writing within. All I could think of was, ""What a rip-off."" I agree with other reviews about how the author wasted pages on minor characters who were completely unnecessary to the story, and yet he seemingly lopped off the pages that would have provided a nice climax and resolution to the lives of the characters that I had bonded with. (YES!!! A book without a climax and resolution. Seems those are the most important components of a good work of fiction.) I'll have to look for the sequel to answer my questions."
5,Magically erotic,"I like sweeping historical dramsa and thrillers (Scarrow, sidebottom, ...), but this chance purchase blew me away. A narrative style that captivates and takes you into yourself, a story that is so charged with verbal and linear eroticism that I culd hardly put it down and a story that encapsulates not only the Victorian values, but ours, they're the same fater all...totally brilliant it envelops you like a cocoon and thrws all the smells, falavours and fears of an age that reflects ours just too much. Male and female psyches are so adroitly painted I wonder just how this michel has been able to penetrate the female psyche so well..."
5,A most marvelous journey!,"The early pages are written as well as any novel as your lone narrator takes you by his (or her) hand to visit a century past, a culture long gone, and human intolerance revisited. Michel Faber has presented a most fascinating glimpse at the morals and social constants of the late 1800s London. I am sure the level of detail, minuet character study, and the ugly work of the working girl will stay with me for some time. A most marvelous journey that I must remark reminded me of Memoirs of a Geisha. It's a long book, but never boring, and the craftsmanship and weaving of the characters is remarkable. It takes you to place, an era, a class, and a culture, which you feel and touch but have never experienced. Is that not what a good Novel is to do? Enjoy and give your time over to that lone narrator who will guide you so gently into the William Rackham household."
5,My favorite read of 2003!,"This is a story about young prostitutes living in the seedier parts of London. It also tells the tales of a young man that works at his father's perfumery, the young self-involved wife, the elder brother that has aspirations to join the clergy, and the people that move in their social circles.The lives of William Rackham and his family change as the result of the actions of a young woman that William comes into contact with. Read the book to find out more - I don't want to ruin a good surprise!This book has surpassed ""The Dress Lodger"", in my opinion, in terms of character development and the literary prowess with which it has been written. It has been written from the point of view of a master of ceremonies presiding over a theater show, and the author was devilishly clever in perpetuating this motif. I could easily see it becoming a movie in the near future. Read it now so you can brag about it later! You are in for quite a treat!"
1,Can't believe I wasted so much time reading this book!,"This book was so long but the author left us high and dry at the end - there was no ending. I'm angry that I spent all those hours reading this book and not have a conclusion. I will never read another book by this author for fear he would do this to me again. I had a lot of time invested in his characters and I (as a reader and paying customer) deserve to know what happened to them.I cannot believe all the reviews that gave this book so many stars. It deserved to get ""zero"" but that was not a choice."
2,too much spunk,Entirely too much repetitive spewing of spunk. I am calling it quits at page 500 or so.
1,A waste of precious time,Having read a review on the book stating that the work could be likened to a modern-day Charles Dickens I was intrigued. I was sadly disappointed and should have chucked the book in the middle as there was no plot and no redeeming social value as far as I could see...what was the point?
1,Trashy Novel,"I must have missed something with this book, before I purchased it I read the reviews and they had 4 stars. I found the author to be arrogant to his readers. I found the writing to be wordy, it took forever to get through it. I skipped alot of pages just because they were degrading to women. You can't be in favor of womens rights and make it through this book. I would not purchase another novel by this author. Very disappointed."
1,top ten worst books,"This has got to be one of the worst books I have read in years. One keeps plodding along reading this very long book, thinking it has got to get better. Unfortunately, it does not. One finally gets to the end, is left very dissatisfied, and winds up thinking what a waste of my time this was."
1,I would not recommend this book to anyone.,"This book disappointed me in several ways:1. Misleading. I don't believe the description on the book jacket accurately described the book - Sugar did not ascent through society, she went from prositute to nanny.2. Very inconsistent style. It felt like this book was written by 2 different people. The intimate style in which the author addresses the reader directly seems to disappear after the first few chapters and then reappears at the very end.3. Disappointing. After reading over 900 pages, I felt the story ended too abruptly, I actually checked to see if there were pages missing out of my book. When I realized that I wasn't missing any pages, I checked to see if the author had passed away and if somebody else ""wrapped it up"" for him.Overall, I have never been so disappointed with a book."
2,falling apart at the seams,"un-opened, the book looked perfect, but once i did EVERY SINGLE PAGE fell off.really bummed out what is a great read content-wise."
3,The ending pissed me off!,"I did enjoy this book, and despite the slow pace, and the fact that i have two little kids so only get to read about 5 pages at a time, i remained engaged with the characters, i liked them and getting through 800 pages at 5 pages a day meant i spent a long time with them. But, really, it ended practically in mid sentence...i can take non traditional, i like it, i liked the author addressing me directly and usually that drives me crazy, but there were simply too many unresolved threads reamining un corralled and then in the last 10 pages, the author ripped about twenty new threads free and left them all dangling...is he planning a sequel? I was irritated to have invested so much time in the characters and the world created by the author to have left it like that. It feels like i left it on the bus."
3,Not as good--or as racy--as promised,"""Crimson Petal and the White"" suffers from two main shortcomings-neither the character nor the character's voice rings true. Sugar and her adventures are more the like the mildly [...] fantasies of a Dickens fan, without any of the master's wit, humanity or plotting genius. I'm not a Victorian prostitute, but I am a woman, and no woman thinks like Sugar, nor do her actions make any sense within the context of the time or place. Faber does have a gift for detail and the dirty bits are done well, but this book is a tough slog as the improbabilities and melodrama pile up. Do yourself a favor-go back to Dickens for the real thing and visit a porn site if you need something spicy."
5,One for the book clubs,"I wish I had a book club, or at least knew someone else who had read this. I need to talk about it. The first seven-eighths are an intriguing what-happens-next story that you can read a few chapters of every night. The last bit I had to read all at once and couldn't put down. I was also completely blown away by the fact that this was written by a man-- it feels like something a woman would write. Very well done."
4,The Crimson Petal and the White is captivating,"Thoroughly captivating, the characters pulled me in and stayed in my head for days while I was reading it and after. I didn't want it to end. I was disappointed that some answers weren't provided at the end, but still enjoyed every page."
1,a whole lot of nothing,"I was so excited to begin this book! I was intrigued from the very beginning by the young prostitute's story and was looking forward to some sort of satisfying ending, whether for good or ill. However, 800-odd pages later, the story just ends, and in the most uninteresting way. I felt quite cheated. It was as if the author just decided, ""I'm done. I'm tired of thinking up new things for her to do, and besides, I'm out of paper.""Save yourself the trouble and the time unless you like endings that aren't really endings."
1,Where Is the Ending?,"I went into this book with high expectations and found it an easy read. Having said that, the ending is totally unsatisfying. In fact, I felt there was really no ending and perhaps the author was setting us up to ""have to"" buy the sequel to find out how the story turns out. I have firm beliefs about ""series"" books: Each book must stand on its own. As I used to tell my kids when they wrote stories in grade school, ""Each story has to have a beginning, middle and an end."" This book got stuck in the middle.By the way, in view of Sugar's musings in the book she is writing about her life as a prostitute in 1870's London, I had anticipated a far different ending--and a resolution to her relationship with Rackham.The book is over 800 pages and I would not recommend wasting time reading it only to be dissatisfied with the way it doesn't turn out."
2,disappointed,I was terriby disappointed. Found it too wordy and without any excitement.The main characters were despicable and yet boring- can't figure out how that happened...all in all a waste of time and money. Sorry.
3,The curtain never quite closes.,"I first heard about this novel on the Diane Reims Show. I was so hooked by an incredible opening line. Then it sort of wandered away, but I didn't mind because it was summer and I was on the beach. I loved the feeling of being there, of the not-so-pretty details of the not-picture-postcard daily lives of ordinary Victorian era English. Faber paints a picture in direct contrast to our contemporary life, which was just the sort of perspective I needed when I picked up the book."
2,Started Strong and Then It Just Died in It's Tracks,"I'm two thirds through this book and I don't know if I have the desire to finish. The book started strong and for a few hundred pages I was enthralled. There were a few oddities like the strange narrative device used at the beginning and then dropped. But the sweeping detail and interesting characters kept me avidly turning the pages.But now, about 2/3 done or more, the book has simply lost it's way. A major character was killed off for no apparent reason (in a book that features a smallish cast of characters). The plot has taken a totally unbelievable turn and the narrative seems to juts be sitting there with nothing to say.Very disappointing to say the least. Don't know if I can summon up the desire to finish, especially since so many readers feel cheated by the ending. The author of this book got the build-up right but he just can't seem to follow through on any of the interesting early material."
3,Disappointing end,"While this book had the potential to be a great read, it spirals out of control towards the end. The heroine just seems to lose that special something that made the first half of the book so enjoyable."
4,Wonderfully descriptive,"A wonderfully descriptive tale; terrific character development; disappointing ending. It's one thing to leave the reader with some uncertainty as to the fate of the characters, but this book gives the reader whiplash with its abrupt ending. The complicated relationships, however, are very well developed and the story is adventurous and does not disappoint."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this book. It sounded like something I would love. Unfortunately, I couldn't get past the first 10 chapters (they are pretty short) As a reader you move from character to character to make your way through the story. Problem was just as I started to get involved with each character the story would move on to another. I found myself not caring and stopped reading the book. Maybe I gave up too soon, but I don't recommend this book."
5,agreement/sorry to reader from san diego,"I agree with everything that has been said above; however:sorry to 'a reader' from san diego, Michel Faber is most definately a man - I should know, as I come from Scotland and have met HIM twice!!"
1,VERY disappointing,"This book has one of the best opening chapters of any book I've read lately. It also has one of the worst endings of any book I've ever read, period. Don't get me wrong: I love historic fiction, I enjoy so-called ""slice of life"" books. I even like books that leave a million questions unanswered. While Sugar is a great character, I grew very tired of and frustrated with everyone in the Rackham household, except Sophie. If you want to read great fiction set in this time period, try ""Tipping the Velvet"" or ""Fingersmith"" both by Sarah Waters."
2,A disappointed book club,"This book is a 300 page work painfully dragged out to 898 pages. The author's narrative technique of making comments directly to the reader didn't work for me -- it was just annoying. In my opinion, the book doesn't really get going until about the last 200 pages. Also, I didn't really find any of the main characters to be very likable so it was hard to get involved in the story. Although one can sympathize with Sugar for the way she was brought up, many of her later problems seemed to be brought on herself by her own greed, shallowness and insecurities. Even when she is in a comparatively better sitution she never helps any of her old acquaintances even though it is in her power to do so. Although some liked it better than others, everyone in our book club agreed that this was a bit of a disappointment"
1,A waste of a good plot,"It is obvious that the author didn't know how to end the story that would not seem fatuous. Therefore he gave up and did not produce one. As a result of the author's cowardliness, the reader is left flat."
2,Note to the Publisher:,"The publisher should examine the editing practices that allow a non-ending of this formless kind on such a large investment (publisher and reader). The income from the same book with a better ending would have been more than double. Every reader tells his friend, ""Great book, except for the ending."" In the case of readers who pride themselves on ""liking"" the ending (nothing there to like), they say ""I loved the book, though many are not sophisticated enough to like the ending."" (Again, what's to like? The ending is not there.) In both cases most people they are talking to do not buy the book. First wave only, maybe part of a second wave. There could have been a year's worth of sales here.Best advice: Don't reveal the ending! It'll spoil it for others! (Huh! What ending??)"
1,TRASH,"I'm not a prude but this book is nothing but trashy porn. I was offended and embarrassed by this book. The author reminded me of a teenage boy trying to find all the metaphors and words he could for penis and semen. I'm sorry-this book is a waste of time and money. The plot had promise but the author ruined it by his continuous and tiring use of offensive and unnecessarily pornographic lanquage. Ernest Hemingway was given a lesson in this by Gertrude Stein when she told him that some of his work was ""inaccrochable""-it sometimes doesn't matter what truth there is in the language if it is in such poor taste that noone can discuss it or display it."
4,"Well-done, rather unusual","This book, approx 800 pages but never dull, is written in precise, colourful language, with apparently minute research to reinforce the various strata of 1875 London (Notting Hill and more degraded environments)life. The relatively few central characters always engross, and there is sufficient, personally pleasing ambiguity in the novel: we never know exactly what happened to Agnes;brother Henry is eliminated relatively early;we know neither Sugar nor Sophie's fate. All we can deduce is that Sugar, the prositute turned governess, assumes the role of avenging and saving angel through her vindictive novel and her arranging the basically decent though not entirely sympathetic Agnes's escape. When she, at the book's end,flees with Sophie, she does so because she cannot part with a young being who, despite difficulties, at least had/has a childhood, something Sugar was cruelly denied."
4,"Awesome, but...","This novel needed a better ending. But, other than that, this was a book I could not put down. :)"
2,so many opportunities,"I dredged through every page of this book thinking that it would eventually go somewhere interesting. Time and time again the author seemed to be heading somewhere in the story, only to drop that part of the storyline with no conclusion. I appreciate the many historical details but feel I wasted my time."
2,"Disappointing ""great read""","I really wanted to like this book but, to be quite honest, there really isn't that much to like. The characters are very shallow, unbelievable, and in some cases utterly unnecessary and inaccessible. ... Morever, the non-ending of this book, particulary the coy last paragraph, is not only ridiculous, but also another literary device to give the book an air of being ""Literature."" It seems that if the writer had indeed spent ten years researcing this book, he could have come up with a more in depth analysis of class than this book provides. This book has many pretensions, which seems to be the plague of many modern fiction writers. Too much emphasis on placed on imitating great authors of the past in order to become the great writer of the present."
1,Terribly Disapopinting,"""Watch your step. Keep your wits about you; you will need them."" The opening lines warn the reader well. I certainly needed my wits and perseverence as well to get through the 898 pages of this book. I feel misled by the customer and book reviews for this novel as I found most of the characters unappealing and the plot aimless after the first half of the book. The time period and the raw, graphic description of the life and times in the sordid sections of Victorian London is compelling. However, except for Sugar, the Rackham characters (family, servents, etc.) are extremely weak and unappealing. If they are indeed representative of the norm for that time, it is a miracle England survived to the 21st century as a superpower. For a far shorter (and less painful) depiction of similar time and circumstances I would suggest the Dress Lodger."
2,Way too long for what you get out of it.,"What attracted me in the first place to this book is the fact that I enjoy historical fiction. I also enjoy books set in London during the 19th century. I figured based on the desciptive of the story that there would be enough action and drama to carry 900 pages. Wrong! What a snooze-fest.I can see that some of my contemporaries really liked the book; that's fair. But honestly, I really could not see where the author could not have condensed a lot of what was written into a more compact story. And yes! The ending -- did the author simply get tired of writing in the middle of the page?"
5,"Surprisingly atmospheric, historical ""slice of life"" drama.","Rarely does one find such a detailed and well researched historical drama. The descriptions of Victorian London are so engrossing that one could be forgiven for getting lost in the atmosphere, forgetting the story all together. Many critics have complained that the characters are not well written or engrossing, However, Faber has written a ""slice of life"" vignette, rather than a story with an ending and with that in mind, has done a brilliant job at making this huge (over 800 pages) book both engaging and entertaining.To find a historical drama as long as War and Peace, that isn't tedious due to overly weighty dialogue or full of ""dead"" chapters of political or social reform rhetoric is rare, finding one that is a page turner, is rarer still. Yet for its length and often heavy subjects (prostitution, degradation, social inequities, etc.) The Crimson Petal and the White moves along very rapidly and is indeed difficult to put down."
2,and a half: average.... i wouldn't read it again...,"This book started off great but then I got sick of the story between sugar and Rackman. And after a while the 'sex' scenes and the way he wrote those parts got to be a little old and tasteless. I got to a point where i skipped most of those parts in the book. I just wasn't in the mood for it after a while. I got a little more than halfway through the book and wanted to stop reading it but I have already invested the time in reading as much as I did and didn't want to put it down. I wanted to know what would happen between the mother and the daughter and William Rackman. This book wasn't horrible but I wouldn't read it again. If someone offers you this book read it, it will keep you busy. If I had to do it over again I would not have spent the money to buy this book."
3,"What a useless, 2nd-rate ending!","Pointless characters, nowhere plot devices - jerked around for 10 days of my life to get to a non-ending. Was it really worth it just because you were too sick of your own material to wrap the last 3rd of the book with satisfying or at least sensible endings? You lost me, buddy."
2,Left flat,"I bought this book based on the reviews on Amazon and on the story description. The depiction of prostitution on Victorian London is intriguing and the main characters are interesting and well developed. However, the story left me flat and I found myself wanting to get done with the book and get on to something more intersting."
2,"Way too long, detailed just for the sake of it","I read this for a book club and really disliked it. Aside from the gratuitous crassness, it was way too long and detailed. Yes, they say the author researched it a lot. Well, good for him, but it could have been about half as long. Also, I didn't really like any of the characters until the very end. Just not a good book, in my opinion."
2,Not impressed,I was not impressed with this book....It took forever for the story to unfold....I would not recommend it as something worth reading.
2,Intriguing but disappointing,"The idea of having the reader be a part of the story was a clever contrivance for this novel. Unfortunately for me, it was the only thing that kept me interested enough to finish this book. There were chapters worth reading but overall, too much detail on things that didn't move the story forward. Not a good buy for me, should have used Prime Lending Library."
3,Good not great,"This book does not really seem to fit it's description, but I don't know how I would describe it better except to say that it was a fascinating story with a disappointing finish. Would probably be excellent for book clubs and make for many interesting discussions."
3,From rags to riches....kind of....,"My rating is 3/5.I enjoyed reading the book but it's not in my top ten. Sure learned a lot about 18th century England and the struggle of women, upper class & very low class prostitutes. Interesting read. Well worth reading for any lover of historical fiction.Sugar, a prostitute since the very young age of 15, in search of a better life crosses paths with William Rackhan, a weathy business owner in search of female favors. This is a tale of the two woven lives and how their choices change their lives in different ways. Interesting to see Sugar's rise while at the same time watch Rackham's desent emotionally. Surprising ending."
5,Juicy!,"This was my first experience reading Faber and I loved his writing style. I have already ordered my second Faber book and I can't wait to receive it. This book was so unpredictable, juicy and a real page turner. Often I can foresee what's going to happen in a story, but Faber never allowed that to happen, especially with the end. I hated the way this story ended. I wanted to reach into the pages and strangle William, but I still appreciated everything about this story. I rarely read books twice, but I can see myself reading this book again the future."
3,I wanted this to be better . . . and it could have been,"Sugar is easily among the best recent female characters I've read written by a man. She has depth, beauty, emotion and honesty. Unfortunately, she is like a still picture from a video or something- an intricate character designed for motion, but frozen in staticity.I felt that so much was left unresolved by the novel, so much that could have been explored and felt and drawn to a proper close. I would have been happy to read another hundred pages if the book could have brought any kind of real closure. Instead, it practically shoves your coat in your hands and points to the door. I liked Sugar too much to have her story end in such a way. I give it three stars for the ride (an alternately beautiful, grotesque, ethereal, involving and disgusting ride), but after 800 pages, I wanted something more."
3,Tell Me How It Ends!,"Seeing that I've gotten only half-way through this tedious narrative, I can only suggest that it is roughly 400 pages too long.What the author was thinking I'm not quite sure, but the excessive use of ink and paper to explain the daily meanderings of a lowly prostitute and a very unimpressive suitor was, is my opinion, very unnecessary. The occasional paragraph describing carnal acts is suffused with dribble, and keeps one reading on only to see if the next sexual act will be any more revealing or, dare I say, exciting?Wait to check it out at the library, and no need to hide it in a cotton bag to hide from the rest of the world. This lengthy novel is primarily narritive, sometimes whitty, sometimes lively, but mostly, sad to say, monotonous."
2,You need a lot of patience...,"You need a lot of patience to get even remotely involved in this book. Two hundred pages into it and I was still ready to throw it in the bin (notwithstanding the author's teasing remarks along the way that it will get more interesting). Honestly, it doesn't get that much more interesting. The characters are not likable so you don't really care what happens to them. However, I did finish it but did not feel satsified with the conclusion."
2,Let down,"I also took several months to finish this novel after having a hard time even getting through the first chapter. I felt that the graphic depiction of a Victorian prostitute's life was the only hook in the whole book, and that got old fast. There was no satisfying character or plot development and the ending was disappointing. It portrays men as pigs with no redeeming qualities and women as their helpless victims. I would not recommend wasting time on this."
2,This book took ten years to write...,"...and will probably take me ten years to read. All the gushing critics seem to have loads of time on their hands to dredge through this impossibly large novel. Faber's spot on in the lushness of his language and descriptions, but somewhere along the way his editor decided to be mesmerized by his prose and forgot to do his job--moving the story along. The novel has more Hardy overtones than Dickens to me, but Hardy wrote in the 19th century, and loved to languish over characters and eccentricities of speech, and yet managed to invest in the reader a love or hate of his characters--and that kept the story moving.Here there is no movement in the plot, a sad commentary on what passes for ""literary fiction"" these days. He could have cut the novel in half, kept a lot of description, jogged along with the storyline...and maybe I would have finished it before writing this review!"
3,slow... slow... slow..!,"I was terribly disappointed. This book was so painfully slow that I had to force myself to finish it. Generally I would have completed a book this size in no more than a week, but this one took nearly four!And the ending... what kind of an ending is that? There is no conclusion, no closure, and nothing is resolved. I definately did not feel that I gained anything from having read this."
3,I really wanted to love this book...,"but I just couldn't bring myself to. I was so looking forward to reading it and I ended up disappointed. I normally love a ""big, fat"" historical novel, but this one just didn't do it for me. I loved the premise of the book, and it seemed to have a good heart to it. However, it was just too wordy for me. I think with a little more editing, I would have loved it. I'd give it 5 stars for effort, but I can't bring myself to rate it any higher than a 3 for my overall enjoyment."
1,An insult to the book reading public,"How does a book like this get selected for publication?The characters are unidimensional. The plot is so trite as to be inconsequential.The only apparent possible appeal is the very frank graphic descriptions of sex and various revolting aspects of life and hygeine in 19th century England. The prurient parts will probably appeal to some pubescent adolescents but have no allure for a mature adult.It is admirable to attempt to write a long Victorian novel in the present day if it is a good novel. Some years ago ""The Quincunx"" was a successful example. This one isn't.How a major publisher invests in trash like this and hypes it with numerous print and radio ads is frankly revolting.I only gave it a one star rating because there is no selection for zero."
1,The Crimson Petal and The White,"First of all, despite it's multi-layered entendre--flowers, colors, etc.--the title is terrible.That said, the book is a tremendous disappointment. It's promising start, with it's perspective and intricate sensory detail, quickly vanishes. We are left with endless repetition; boring, and often repulsive, sexual scenes; and a host of characters who are cliches.This is a long, long book. It has no ending. It just stops. The editing is atrocious (Was there any editing?)The idea that the author has set us up for a sequel is enough to make one relinquish one's lunch in the most Faberesque manner."
1,PHEW!,"Well-written junk. Pinkies up porn. Supposed to be Victorian but the changing point of view and pace are out of ""Moll Flanders"" and ""Tom Jones"" without the charm and wit."
2,"Disappointing, after great reviews","I had wanted to like this book a lot after reading several excellent reviews. I feel like I was reading a different bookj---one with, yes, fascinating details of daily life I had not known before, but not much else. An editor was much needed for this book----as it appears to be unedited. Repetitive, slow, and dreadly uninteresting at times, the book needs a good 300 pages cut from it. The slash and burn would not be difficult as the author drones on and one.I won't. But I also will not recommend this book to others."
3,Three Things I Didn't Like About This Novel,"I usually choose long historical novels because I like to be transported to another century and/or location, but there were three things I didn't like about this book. First of all, the chatty, Victorian-style narrative was too ""cutesy"" and contrived. It was distracting. Then, I thought the raw sex was overdone. Lastly, I kept looking for a final noun in the title ""The Crimson Petal and the White""...WHAT? I even checked to see if the publisher made an error in the title. This does happen. I teach Psychology and we had one text book which mispelled ""Adolescence"" on the cover. In summary, I do not recommend this book for a pleasant day's reading at the beach."
3,"well, it started off amazing","when i started reading the crimson petal and the white i was so excited! i couldn't wait to get home and read it. it was a new approach to storytelling. but the approach kind of stopped midway through the book. and then suddenly came back on the last page of the book. the writing was good throughout, but the method of storytelling just wasn't consistent. the characters were strong and interesting, and i wanted to keep reading about them even when the book was over. i didn't mind the length at all; all part of the victorian novel experience in my mind."
2,"I was really excited to read this, but . . .","I was excited to read this, because I thought the description looked so good, but it wasn't anything great. The ending didn't bother me - it was the tedium. The plot was quite repetitive. I got tired of everyone, instead of being eager to read the next scene. It's not worth the 800 page investment."
2,a disappointment,"This is a well-written book that hooked me from the beginning with its intial character portraits and fascinating depiction of Victorian London- the rich and the seamy sides. Despite its length, I could not put it down. The book moves on towards a sad conclusion as the relationship between Sugar and her rescuer evolves but I completely agree with another reviewer who described the ending as ""the author simply stopped writing"". I have never felt so let down or disappointed in a novel. The ending is not a tease; it does not leave the reader to conjecture what might be- it just ends. A neat, tidy ending would not strengthen this book but weaken it- but this ending undoes all the work of the previous hundreds of pages. I am surprised it is so well reviewed as a result. I cannot recommend this."
3,Not exactly what I was expecting.,"After much anticipation I was pretty disapointed by this book. The author does a great job of describing the main character's life, but the story itself left much to be desired. After over 800 pages I expected more from the author, the characters and the story. The book ended without much of an ending, and sadly the reader is left out in the dark. I would reccomend this book if you want to read 800 plus pages just to be thoroughly let down in the end."
2,Nope....... didn't like it.,"Having just (finally) set aside this novel, what leaps to mind is that there is a very fine line between being eloquent and being verbose. This author crosses the line far too often. The book is roughly twice as long as it needed to be... that's 400 pages too long by my account.It soon became evident that the primary characters were all motivated by either the love of, or hatred for, sex. This was the driving force which propelled their generally miserable lives.There was nothing lyrical or engaging about the sex; it was ever-present and almost always lugubrious.Obviously I wouldn't recommend the book. There are those who purport to have enjoyed it. Good for them but I cannot think why. All the men or women are corrupt in some fashion. It became preposterous and tiresome. Predicatable ending too."
2,Was I reading the same book as the other reviewers?,"I just finished this book and while I agree that this book is rich in detail and language of London, it does not adequately capture the class struggle of 1800's London, the demeaning treatment of women and the potential problems with family relationships. I only wonder what personal female relationship problems the author had over the several years it took to write this book. It starts out as a Victorian ""Pretty Woman"", then moves to a weak imitation of ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" and finally leaves the reader wondering if there is a subsequent novel in the works. How disappointing, don't bother to spend your money or your time on this novel."
3,I felt betrayed by the ending...,"All that reading, and no payoff...this otherwise-great book suffers by not ending anything! People wander off to unknown fates and the book ends. Bleah. I was also put off by Faber's shtick at the beginning of the writer addressing the reader in person. However, this ended fairly quickly and was only revisited a few times throughout the book. Half a star off for this conceit and 1.5 stars off for the disappointing ending. I ranted for half an hour (to my family's dismay) after finishing the book."
2,Great Expectations Unfulfilled,"I kept reading, despite the dullness of the plot, waiting patiently for the story twists to unfold that would take me into the lives of extraordinary people in an exrtroardinary story that I knew had to be there somewhere based on reading reviews like Publisher's Weekly. But the plot remained bland and never wavered, never rose up out of undevelopment. It's extraordinary how in so many pages nothing worthy of praise can occur. (If I want Dickens-like, I read Dickens. And This Is Not In the Same Ball Park with Dickens) Does one go with the first plot that comes into the mind? What a waste to not make these characters unforgettable after so many words."
2,The Unfinished Book,"I am an avid reader. Rarely do I leave a book unfinished. But I must admit, I threw in the towel on this one half the way through. I found myself putting it down and not wanting to pick it up again. The descriptions in the book are extremely detailed - possibly too much so. After a while it all became boring. There seemed no end to the gloom and doom. Regardless of whether the character was depraved or deprived or successful and rich, they all seemed unhappy and frustratingly stifled. I kept looking for some relief. And, maybe it was to come in the second half of the book, but I just couldn't plod through it to find out."
3,800+ pages with no real ending.,"I was engrossed with this book from the minute I picked it up. I loved Faber's style, I liked the fact that the novel was billed as a ""Victorian epic"" while still being fairly modern in other aspects, I believed that this novel had taken Faber twenty years to write. So I rushed toward the ending, wanting more than anything to know what would happen to the prostitute Sugar, the poor sickly wife Agnes, the rotund stressed-out businessman William, the quiet and obedient daughter Sophie...and...NOTHING. The novel simply ended, with no apologies for its abruptness, and I felt cheated. I don't require a happy ending to enjoy a book, or even a completely wrapped-up ending, but I feel that this book did not have an ending at all. Disappointing, to say the least, because the rest of the novel was exemplary."
3,review of the crimson petal and the white,"this book would have been really good, if the author would just get to the point and stop talking, elaborating, reflecting, reminiscing, babbling really about everything else like the environment of the characters for examples or really detailing the victorian times. we get it life truly sucks back then, but move on already! he just went overboard with the background info of everyone and everything. the readers looses touch of what is going on."
3,"I started out loving this, very compelling","and then at about a hundred pages into the story, I found myself wanting to hit fast forward. it started out GREAT but it just began to dwell too long on details, and being that my attention span isnt so great,it lost my attention. I am going to pick it up again maybe now that things are calmer (bought it before the holidays, hectic time in my house) and now that things are less hectic, Im hoping it will flow a little faster for me now, because it was soo very well written, that Im hoping it was just that I personally was having a time concentrating, on anything at all. the beginning is very attention getting!"
2,I felt so cheated!,Horrible thing to do to a person. There is no ending to this book. When you finally start to care what happens you turn the page and see THE END!!
1,The Crimson Petal and the White,"One of the best reads in a long time, until the non-ending. It ruined the whole book. The author should be ashamed of himself. He's a much better storyteller than this."
2,Interesting but ultimately fails,"I found this book to be engrossing, and at times extremely entertaining, but in the end, it fails due to its shoddy ending. It is a shame, as until that point, the book is extremely well written, with a riveting story set amidst a highly detailed and fascinating backdrop of Victorian England that makes one feel as if one is almost reading a historic novel. Then comes the ending, which leaves the reader completely dissatisfied, wondering why one has wasted so much time on such a long novel.Had Faber given as much effort to the final part of the book as he did to the rest, ""The Crimson Petal and the White"" would merit four or five stars. As it is, it gets the rating I have given it."
2,time better spent elsewhere,"This is one of the few books I've put down without finishing. The plot was trite, the characters monotonous & unlikable & the sex was lurid, mechanical & repugnant. This book seemed to be a sad attempt to emulate Dickens, but only represents an insult to that great writer. Don't waste your time."
1,Characters with no motivation,"The reason you keep reading this novel is because you keep looking for the meat. You get no real sense of any of the characters, why they are doing what they are doing, etc. An event takes place, or a new feeling is expressed, and you've had no inkling, and cannot figure out why this character did or felt what they did. Scenes do not build. We start over with each character with each scene."
1,Desperately seeking an editor...,"I read the glowing professional reviews and thought this book had promise. OMG! The prose was often good, but buried in daily tedium that didn't advance the story and page after chapter of repetitive musings of characters that weren't interesting. The protagonist, Sugar and her sugardaddy, William, were only given sketchy backstories. Did the editor fall asleep reading this? The ending? I guess the author got as tired of the story as I did and decided to end it by leaving the characters, pretty much in mid-step with nothing resolved, nothing learned... I could almost see him muttering, 'how clever!' No, just irritating, dude."
3,Unfulfilling,"I agree with a lot of posters here. Beautifully written, poetic in words, language is scintillating without being overdone. Yet.... it doesn't go anywhere. The characters and the narrator move at the same pace. There are no climaxes, no downfalls, no nothing. The blurb and the reviews make it sound so promising. Yet only the store-telling is what makes you see this through.In saying that it's taken me 2.5 years to get through half of the book. It's not the sort that I pick up and don't put down until the end, it's the sort that I read 50 pages and need a break because it doesn't MOVE."
3,"Needs a good editor, and a story","It became apparent to this reader, at about page 300 or thereabouts, that the author, in the twenty years it took to write and rewrite his novel, was never quite able to come up with a story. The narrative moves slowly, and is rather static -- we believe something profound is about to happen, but it never really does. I found the character of poor Agnes much more compelling than Sugar -- it's as if Faber simply ran out of steam with his heroine. The inner lives of most of these characters are lacking; what does William want? What does Sugar want, really, for that matter? I could see the pages of research in every frame of this book, but I wanted more than that. I wanted a deeper examination of the characters, and a plot. It felt as if he didn't know what to do with the characters other than describe their actions, and the environment they inhabit. All except for Agnes, whose desires are painfully, mournfully clear."
1,Like a bad relationship you should have ended sooner...,"I decided last night at page 239 that there's no point. I had high hopes that it would be more interesting, that perhaps I just needed to give it a chance, give it more time to develop. But after several chapters of ""is it going to get any better"", I just had to come to terms and stop. Wish I could say otherwise. I should have read these reviews before I bought it at Costco."
3,Better than Average,"A solid album with only a couple of stand out tracks. Check out Lady and Mi Amor. Although not the knock out debut album I expected, it is a nice and mellow start."
3,This music is great until about the fifth time you hear it.,"After reading rave reviews about ""Brother and Sister,"" I was a little disappointed with the content. The lyrics are lacking but some of the songs are so much fun that it is good for at least five listens. Listen before you buy!"
2,"Sorry, I was not feeling this.","I was just disappointed with this entire cd. I don't know, maybe I had high expectations looking at the songs they previously had on soundtracks. When I bought this it barely got played all the way through."
5,What happens when you mix Hip-Hop and Neo-Soul!,"Wow! This two really surprised me. The first time I saw them was on Motown Live when they performed ""High Heel Shoes"" and ""Attraction"" and spoke about they got this project ""Sister And Brother"" together. Besides the fact that they are Sister and Brother, their aim to get all their Sista's and Brotha's to listen to this. The album has some real Funk, R&B, Reggae, Hip-Hop, Rap, Neo-Soul, Gospel and a great feel to it. Great standout Hip-Hop/Neo-Soul songs are: Shake It, Foolish Heart, Lady, Raw, High Heel Shoes and Attraction. They even do some Classical Movement in: Mi Amor, a beautiful ballad. Well, what more do I need to say. It's a mixture of Erykah Badu, D'Angelo, Angie Stone and more mixed together. Definately something to cop!"
2,"Good Idea, Good Pictures, Bad on cooking steps",Having bought this book and making some of the curries. I found that the steps and the ingredients just do not jive at times. She should've spent more time make sure the steps were correct. The curries just didn't taste right.
1,Cuzco,"As mentioned in other reviews, many of the steps and ingredients do not ""jive"" or correlate. I've attempted several recipes and have been destroyed by the woefully inept editing, by far the worst of any cookbook that I've ever owned. A terrible, terrible disappointment."
3,Nothing to write home about,"This is an ok CD to pop in your player if you're wanting some decent background music, but there's nothing particularly gripping here. It's actually kind of boring, and I love Egyptian music both traditional and modern. This is like elevator music's interpretation of Egyptian music.I'm to the point in my musical collection now where if something doesn't reach out and make think ""Wow... that's freakin' awesome/beautiful/etc!"" I don't bother with it. And this just doesn't do that for me.But, hey, it IS cheap. I'll give it that. So, it's not as if you're going to be out alot of money by giving it a try. This may be a good ""wading pool"" CD for someone getting used to more eastern music."
3,Canadian spy story,"This 1977 Canadian film is a fast-paced but rather frenetic espionage drama. Margot Kidder, playing a bank executive, and the late Michael Sarrazin, playing a journalist, take an ill-fated train ride, and discover an international conspiracy involving a new computer chip. The plot is actually quite good. There are enough twists to keep the viewer guessing, and an intriguing reversal at the end. The problem in this film is that it alternates between trying to be a serious thriller and a lighthearted adventure, ending up being more of the latter. The comedic elements end up detracting from the real tension in the plot."
4,credit not given on 1 track,"The track entitled ""nixon's walk"" is listed as being written by michael kamen. However, it is merely arranged by him. The piece is (in english) called ""when i am laid in earth"" by Henry Purcell and was written in the 17th century. It is used in other films, including a similar arrangement in the movie ""downfall"" from 2004. The original piece includes a female vocalist and I highly recommend finding a copy of it as it is even more beautifully dark than Kamen's string arrangement.In reviewing the whole soundtrack, I loved it and thought it was appropriate throughout. Some of the best music ever written for tv and on par with any great war film score."
5,"Great, but typical","This soundtrack is, without a doubt, the best soundtrack to become available since Gladiator. And for a TV program, especially a miniseries, this has EXCELLENT music and emotional quality to it. Some of the best tracks are 1, 2, and 3. The only downside to this score is that it is somewhat typical of today's instrumental, specifically involving choral numbers, scores. There's just not a whole lot difference in this score from anything else, unless you count the beautiful, haunting ""Plaisir D'Amour,"" which very aptly uses a chorale. Aside from this, it is a VERY good soundtrack and well worth picking up. The only way this soundtrack could be ruined would be for it to be completely misused in the actual series."
3,"Nice try, but it's not as good as it aspires to be.","Band of Brothers was, for the most part (ten parts, bound to be flawed here and there), a terrific miniseries with a memorable cast, stunning battle scenes, and occasionally powerful drama. If you're into war films, be sure to catch it sometime. Michael Kamen's score, however, is of a slightly different case. There's no doubt in my mind the man tried his hardest to compose a score worthy of the series' material. What he comes up with is a pretty enjoyable listen, but after hearing the material repeated so many times, the emotions sort of run dry and the main theme sounds like an uneven mixture of heroism and schmaltz. For sorrowful, somber music done right, I much prefer John Williams' work for Saving Private Ryan."
5,krugerbay,"I loved the movie, and the CD came wrapped and in great condtion, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the movie, the music is wonderful"
5,Band of Brothers,"I just recently saw this series on DVD. Every time a new episode started,I was treated to the excellent opening theme. This album will bring enjoyment to all that are familiar with the series and really enjoyed all the music."
5,Comprehensive soundtrack,"You really can feel the series. No cutting or snippets, or best of.....full, long, and great. Several of the selections are great to drive to on repeat play."
5,I'm a teenager and listen to this all the time,"After watching the series I just realized I loved the music and had to have it, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this. The music is great. My favorite songs on the cd are: the main theme; buck in hospital, and parapulie.I reccomend you buy this album."
2,Raven's Nook Order - Growing Up Girl,"I first ordered this item (Growing Up Girl age 14) from Raven's Nook via Amazon.com. It was presented as new. However, when received, it came without the box, stained, and clearly not new. I contacted the Raven's Nook via Amazon mail, as requested by the sender. His response was, ""return it, it's not worth arguing over"". I thought this to be curt and uncalled for, as there was no argument. It had been misrepresented and I requested a refund. I didn't appreciate the implication that I was the one at fault. I did return it, however, I am not sure if we received a refund. My husband does not recall, it was a while ago. It would be helpful if review requests came closer to the time of the order.I ordered another from a Hallmark store, I didn't use Amazon that time. Mrs. David (Jody) Halvorson"
1,Iomagic will not honor any warranty if purchased from Amazon,"I purchased the 1TB model of the Iomagic external drive. After 5 months It would intermittantly disconnect and stop writing files half way through. I called the company support who agreed the product was defective and needed repair. However they would not issue an RMA since their warranty only applies to 10 authorized distributors and Amazon as well as Compusa, etc are not among them. http://iomagic.com/Vendors/index.asp This policy was also reaffirmed by the company head of customer support (who I spoke to) as well as their President (whom I wrote a letter to) . In effect THERE IS NO WARRANTY!!"
5,Reliable hard drive,"I purchased the IOMagic Gigabank Micro 12GB about a year ago. I how found it extremly reliable and I have had no problems with it. I have it plugged in for several hours a day and use it regularly. I am posting because I saw that two people posted reviews on a different version of this drive.Pros:-Very small (I put it in my coat or pants pocket and barely notice it)-The drive can easily be pluged in with its built in usb plug. The plug rotates so it can fit in nearly any usb slot. Therefore you dont need a seperate cable like other external hard drives-The drive transfers files fast enough. I have had several portable hard drives and one flash drive and they are all slower than built in hard drives. But this one feels fast for a portable and I have never had it fail in a transfer which I have had happen with other portables.-It is well built, I have had no issues with it"
2,Worked great...while it lasted.,"I purchased the 8GB version. While it lasted, it worked well. Not perfect or quite as fast as an 8GB flash drive, but it did work.About 1 month after purchase, it stopped working. With reference to the other review, the company also told me that Amazon, and several other on-line stores were not included in the warranty because they could not guarantee how the product would be treated before purchase. Based on this, I disassembled mine.The HD controller is good, as I had a spare 80GB 1.8"" HD laying around and it works with the new drive. The original Cornice drive just went bad.I would honestly recommend buying a flash drive instead. It's really gotten cheaper compared to micro hard disks."
3,Decent B movie for a good laugh,"I didn't know what to expect when I saw this item,but I was curious enough to check it out.It has it's funny parts,but as a whole,it's pretty far fetched. It's good for a late night get togather with some friends,but don't expect anything more than what it claims to be...an odd B flick. Oh yeah...cool cover photo."
5,Funny Movie!,"For people who know allot about Jeffrey Dahmer, and John Wayne Gacy this movie is pretty funny. It very random at some spots and it a movie to play when friends are over and want to watch something crazy on TV! It also a movie that can be watch over and over again and still make you laugh it was worth the money I LOVED IT!"
4,Best Serial Killer Battle Since Freddy Vs. Jason!,"Dahmer Vs. Gacy has a sick and warped sense of humor, but's that's all good because so do I. This movie isn't for everyone. Heck, it might not be for most people. I'd say that you should give it a shot if you are a Troma fan. Dahmer Vs. Gacy isn't a Troma movie, but it seems like one. It's cheap, dumb but fun, trashy, and profane. But it also has some cleverness. The newscasts are the best part. And while this isn't an outright gorefest, there is some decent gore on display. See it if the title amused you, and the movie might amuse you as well!"
3,its an okay movie,watched it once thought it was okay nothing great anybody want to buy a used copy? i have one for sale

1,"Propaganda, not Archeology - anti-Israel","I have a backround in archeology and have dig experience. i am interested in the archeology of the Holy Land (Israel/Palestine/Levant).I found this book worthless. It is just one , big, hot-air- filled polemic denouncing Israel and Judaism. This is bereft of all insight and discussion of actual archeology and its practices.It could be argued that this is a study not of archeology, but of a history of archeology. But using that pious fraud Said as a model makes this without value as well.I was shocked and distraught over the action of the Muslim Waqf in its destructive ""remodeling"" lf the Temple Mount/Al Aqsa Mosque from 1996-2000. It seems archeology has no value to the PLO and, as noted by this book, by El-Haf. Well, it has value to me.This is nothing but a crude political attack on the legitimacy of Israel. More 'pseudo-history from the PLO."
1,What next?,"What's next?.""Aristotle the arab muslim"" or "" The writings of Prophet Plato (Peace Be Upon Him)"".You can mark the stages of the American academy's decline by the resurrection of Noam Chomsky, the ascension of Edward Said, the introduction of Norman Finkelstein and the tenure of Nadia Abu El-Hadj."
4,Nice product.,"Although a bit costly, they seem to be working out as advertised. I use them mostly for jeans. If a belt isn't working for you I would give these a try."
1,Do you ever feel like you've been cheated?,"I own the original ""Paerl Harbour '79"" on vinyl and was excited to see it was released on CD. These are two entirely different records. The original was a live LP. This is just a crappy repackaging of the US Version of the first LP."
5,A good book.... and the most accessible Feyerabend....,"This is the only book that Feyerabend really meant for a popular audience-- not that he was really a very esoteric philosopher to begin with. But, in this text, he comes across as brilliant, engaging, and very erudite and posits a case for how we think... and how we classify reality....If you haven't read any Feyerabend.... as hated as he is by scientists, etc. he is worth reading. REALLY worth reading.... and this is perhaps the best place to start...."
3,Painless 30302 gauge wiring harness,"Wiring harness was configured for speedometer and tack in the center and smaller gauges placed to each side, Since my gauges were arranged with my speedometer and tack together and the four smaller gauges all on on side, I had to take the harness apart and rearrange the wires to suit my arrangement. The pines that came with the matching plugs were the wrong pines."
2,Only Worth it for the Car Charger,"This kit is absolutely horrible. The screen protectors have scratches on them while new. The protector for the touch screen is good until you use it for about five minutes then air bubbles appear from nowhere. After that, it will get loose and curl up, making it always touching the screen more in one area so it won't respond to where you touch. The earphones and really short and sound horrible. Though the feature of rolling up like they do it a good idea, this entire kit is not worth buying. The car charger is the only thing that works, but there aren't that much uses for it unless you travel a lot."
1,Terrible and Defective,"The screen protector for the lower screen, which requires the use of a stylus, is too thick, comes with no instructions and leaves bubbles when placed on the screen, effectively ruining the picture. In addition, it is VERY difficult to remove and leaves little bits of adhesive in it's wake.The DS is an entertainment system costing a couple hundred dollars and this screen protector is so sticky I had to be careful peeling it off in order to avoid severely damaging the screen itself. Luckily the DS itself is well-made and as near as we can tell thus far, no damage was done.The final problem was with the headphones. The wires attaching the individual earphones together left about four inches where a person's head should go. They did not pull apart and if they were meant to be there was, again, no instruction.If you want a starter kit like this, don't waste your money, buy Nintendo certified instead."
1,JUNK PLAIN JUNK,The screen protector just plain does not work. The touch screen does not work after putting over it. It also hardly stayed in place!! Don't waste your $$ !!!!
1,This Sucks,"I was just about to start using this kit on my DS but when I went to my aunt's (game freak) said not to use it because it can cause damage to my DS so the next day she took me to walmart and we looked at starter kits we finally found a offical nintendo licensed starter kit for $17.95 Wow offical I thougt and it comes with a case,game cases,nice headphones,Offical Nintendo screen protecters, and 3 offical Nintendo styluses 1red 1blue 1black hoped this helpLiz 11yro"
1,Ruins the Screen,"Do not, I repeat, do NOT get this. I recieved a Nintendo DS for Christmas and the 'protective screen cover RUINED the bottom screen! Gameplay is now blurred and there are bubbles on the screen. INTEC DOES NOT BELONG IN THE VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY! BOYCOTT INTEC!"
2,This Is TERRIBLE,"This kit is awful. I bought it for the sole reason of the screen protectors, but I put the bottome one on and.. BOOM, air bubbles. I could barely SEE the screen. Because of the adhesive on the ""protector"" it was really hard to get off. I was afraid that it would damage my ds, but it didn't. SO DON'T waste money on this!I have to admit the headphones are cool, and the car adapter would work, so if you really MUST buy this, dont even touch the screen protectors."
1,These are always junk!,"I would not recommend this product. For $5 more, you can buy an officially licensed product, which is proven to be much better quality. I'm amazed that these companies are still selling these starter kits, as every one I've ever purchased from the store was immediately returned.Usually, none of the items work as they are supposed to, the headphones have terrible sound, etc.Spend the extra $5 and get the starter kit that carries the official Nintendo seal - it's much better quality."
4,A must Get,"This is one of those "" Must Haves "" for a DS. Not so much for the headphones (Most people already have tons of those from CD players and such). And a little for the car adapter , never know when you might need it. But the Protective screens are a must. Had my DS for about 2 weeks now and the touch screen has a good amount of scratches already from using the thumb pad on it. Granted its sandy as hell where I am but still. Its not bad enough to ruin the screen but you can feel the scratches when you move over them, which is very annoying when I'm playing Mario 64 DS. Plus the system is 2 weeks old and the bottom screen already has more scratches than my 1+ year old Game Boy Advance SP Screen. So just a heads up if your in a dusty / sandy enviroment, get some protective screens for your DS. Hope this help."
1,best stick with gameboy products,"I learned my lesson with memory cards, to only buy the gamecube ones, and it goes the same for this stuff. It was a Christmas present for my son and I knew it wasn't going to work but tried it anyway. When I listened through the earbuds, you could only hear in one ear, which drives me crazy. When I returned the opened package I could only exchange it for another of the same. When it comes to buying accesories for gameboy/gamecube, always use their own items."
4,Under-appreciated late 80s goodness,"Some really nice cuts on this one, especially the a-side. Great vocals and fresh rhythms, it always makes me happy."
3,Resident Evil: Code Veronica videogame music soundtrack,"I own a couple of the Resident Evil soundtracks (as well as numerous other videogame and movie soundtracks) and was not so impressed with this one.While there are a few really good songs, there's a lot of mundane and rather mediocre ones, compared to some of the other soundtracks, in my opinion.If you're a hardcore RE fan and love the music, then definitely get this- especially since this one is far cheaper than some of the other rare ones, like the RE: Nemesis soundtrack.This one had about 5 songs I really loved and another 10 or so that I thought were okay. The rest, I thought, ""meh"".One plus- a lot of songs 40+, so there's a lot and you may find them more entertaining than me!Take care, God bless."
4,Works ok for small area or tent,WIll cover simple smells in a small area or tent. Sorta gives it a public bath room smell though. LOLI dont think this will work on heavier smells very well. Just get a carbon filter system and be happy.
1,love ona but block disappointed,"I have used Ona products for years. I love the Linen scent and use the liquid concentrate and gel to eliminate pet odors. It is lightly scented and neutralizes odors. There is not a heavy perfume odor like cover-ups. HOWEVER, I ordered two blocks for the first time and was very disappointed. They were extremely strong smelling the first two days and then did not smell at all unless I put my nose right to them. I would recommend going with the gel and concentrate instead, although that requires refilling as it evaporates, which is does quickly here in the Arizona desert."
1,still stinks,"Moved into a home that had been a ""grow house"" by the smell of the closet. I don't want my linens smelling skunky. Looked on line and found all the web sites that cater to ""those folks"" were touting this product. Rip off!!!It didn't eliminate odor and the smell was like an institutional cleaner (hospital, nursing home, day care) ew!To be fair, nothing else has gotten the smell out either (washed walls with cleaners, vinigar, baking powder/water paste etc.)Finally just used a car air freshener in there to try to mask the odor. After 4 months, still skunky."
2,the truth is...,"Simply, no, she did not violate the nurse practice act. This is a silly supposition."
2,Last Minute review up at BitterBalcony.com,"[...]Here is the first two paragraphs for you:""Stephen Norrington directs this movie about Billy Byrnes rise and fall from grace as a great... Director... Photographer... Philosopher... Fraked if I know. This whole movie goes by talking about how great he is then how he lost it. What did he do that was so great? Dunno. What did he do that was so bad? Dunno. What does he do? He, look at that, a resounding DUNNO!The movie starts off with David (Max Beesley) talking into the camera about this thing that he knows that will blow your mind. Of course he takes forever to get to the point and it utterly bores. Just because you have a quick talking Brit that has spikey hair talking into the camera doesn't mean an audience will be drawn in. He's not that charismatic and what he has to say, frankly, is not all that mind-blowing.""Enjoy!"
4,Good for kids or adults,"Hillerman brings to life this story from the Zuni, a Pueblo People of New Mexico. As the cover jacket says, this is ""intended to teach both history and morality of a people"", like an Old Testament story. The strength of the young boy who constructs a toy insect out of corn, is both touching and has lessons for us now in how we treat others and our resources. The drawings by Janet Grado, add nicely to the story, particularly the portraits of the corn maidens and the old woman. Although suitable for children, fans of Toni Hillerman will also enjoy this."
3,Somewhat disappointed,It shredded. I guess someone else would find it useful.Perhaps I misunderstood what the performance wold be and the effect.
4,Purchased as a laundry brush,I purchased this brush to use to rub a gel stain remover into dirty laundry. It works well so far. The brush is gentle but effective.
3,Good for the price!,"Some hairs fall off when you use it. But for the price I guees it's ok, it does the job."
1,Scratched silverplate flatware,"I tried this on silverplate flatware and found it left tiny scratches on the smoth areas around the detailing I was trying to clean. I'm am very picky about polishing my silver and do it annually, however a friend asked me to see what I could do with her set which was extremely tarnished and had damage on a few pieces. After polishing I decided to try out this brush on one of the damaged pieces first to test. I was disappointed."
5,Un Chapeau de Paille D'Italie,"This book is a Vaudeville about a man on his wedding day, trying to find a certain Itaian Straw Hat, which leads to many complications. I really liked this book, and I thought it was hilarious. It kept me entertained all the way through, and I had a lot of good laughs. The characters are very stereotypical, like the very protective father-in-law, but that just adds to the play's humor."
4,Good Book,"I just finished reading this book and I was pretty impressed. I am a civil engineering student and of course am interested in projects like the Big Dig. This book is a pretty easy read: the text is big and the sentence structure is simple. However, it is a very informative book and explains the project in terms that anyone could understand. I think it would be hard to read this book without going to Boston and seeing the construction site as the pictures are somewhat hard to follow. Other than that, a good book!"
2,I'M ON WHIPS TONIGHT,"Clearly this is not Lee Marvin's most memorable role. After robbing an armed vehicle using a bazooka, wearing a suit with a red carnation, Jimmy Cobb (Lee Marvin) hides out in a barn at a farmhouse owned by oversexed siblings who abuse their help. He ditches the money in the wheat field, but it is quickly removed by a boy who enjoys whiskey, cigarettes, and the local cat house where his aunt works. Everyone is after the money they think is buried in the field.The film has lost something over time. My bad transferred to DVD copy made watching a film that lacked some entertainment value more difficult. The film claims it was made in 1984, but it has the feel of a 1970's sex comedy. Even Lee Marvin couldn't save this film.Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, sex, nudity, sex talk."
4,Great Map But Fine Print A Little Too Fine,"I liked the fact that this map covered Manhattan in its entirety, but found the printing on the map a bit too tiny, and you had to turn it over to see the continuation of the island. Other than that, it is a good basic map and handy fold up size. Also quite sturdy."
4,No Chrysler Building?,"I'm a big fan of Streetwise maps, and Manhattan is no exception; my only problem with it, the only reason it doesn't get five stars, is because I'm also a big fan of the Chrysler Building, and it isn't marked on the map. I suppose that's because it's not open to the public, unlike the Empire State, and you don't need to know where it is in order to see it if you're in Manhattan, but still... not entirely rational, I suppose, but a mild disappointment nonetheless."
5,don't leave home without it,"I bought this guide when I first moved to NYC 7 years ago. I carried it with me every day as I got to know my way around. I could be adventurous when I was armed with my ""steetwise"" map because I could walk wherever I wanted and I'd use the map to find the closest subway no matter where I wound up. I continued to carry it with me in my bag every day as long as I lived in New York because you never know when someone will invite you to some new place after work and you need to plan your course for the evening. This guide helps you move around like you're a native and its so small and light there's no reason not to have it with you always. Note: the first one I bought had a couple errors in the subway stops near Central Park on the B and D trains, but I bought another one a year later and found no errors on it. (Now that I've moved out of New York, I even feel nostalgic when I see my old ""streetwise manhattan"". It served me well.)"
2,Narrow shoe,"This is a pretty shoe. Has a very high heel. The toe of the shoe is very narrow and almost pointed. If your toes like to have breathing room, this is the wrong shoe for you."
5,Wonderfu!,"Shirley Rousseau Murphy's Joe Grey and Dulcie mysteries are addicting! I'll be reading them all, and hoping for future installments!"
4,Great book,"This is a great book in the Joe Grey series. Joe, Dulcie and Kit find the clues that prove Chief Max Harper did not murder anyone. Great way to introduce the Garza family into the series. I just wish my cat would talk to me!"
4,mostly a KNOCKOUT!,"A few of the tracks are kind of difficult to really get into, but there's plenty of rich juicy stuff here, particularly the last track ""We'll Meet Again Someday."" Marsalis has composed a score that justly deserves to be joined with this truly amazing documentary on a truly amazing man and boxer."
4,It is good.......again,"This is fun music that takes you back in time. Back to..oh..the 1999 release ""Reeltime"". The soundtrack Wynton wrote for the movie ""Rosewood"" that was not used. Play track #1 on both albums ""Rosewood"" on ""Reeltime"" and ""What Have You Done"" on ""Unforgivable Blackness""...notice a similarity. Try ""Rattlesnake Tail Swing"" on ""Reeltime"" and..um..""Rattlesnake Tail Swing"" on ""Unforgivable Blackness"". By now I'm sure you get the point. The music is certainly given a different treatment on both albums but that doesn't change the fact that this music is not original to this soundtrack. I guess it has gotten to the point that Wynton and ""his"" are now repeating themselves. Noticeably missing from the liner notes are Stanley Crouch and his pontifications (which I actually enjoy), I guess he must have felt that he said it all the first time with ""Reeltime"". Musically this a very good album but I liked ""Reeltime"" better. What the hell be a fool and buy both...God knows I did."
3,"Period Pieces, Not Interpretation","With four previously released tracks and two outtakes from the Rosewood, one can casually dismiss the score to the excellent Ken Burns documentary as being unforgivable; a major artist should create - not recreate - music.But the tracks work as period pieces that Burns obviously wanted. Please remember that Marsalis had worked with Burns previously on Ken Burns's Jazz miniseries and Burns obviously knew what he needed for Unforgivable Blackness.I wish the liner notes included information penned by Marsalis on why he chose the tracks and how he felt each piece fit the mood in the specific part of the documentary. The purchaser is left with piecing together the ""picture"" of music with the screen.While the Miles Davis soundtrack of nearly 40 years ago is vastly superior musically, Marsalis does capture the feel of American popular music in the early 20th century."
1,Poor quality level from Starrett - surprising,"I was really disappointed with the poor quality of this level. It had many sharp edges, poor machining and a sloppy paint job. This is a poor reflection on Starrett.The design is good, but this product shows a breakdown in Starrett's quality control."
2,Arrived deflated,"I bought this cotton candy for a kids' party. I wasn't able to use it because the cotton candy arrived the form of a tiny, hard rock. There should be a disclaimer warning that the candy will be ruined if exposed to summertime temperatures."
5,YUUUUMMMMY,"This is great. I personally like the licorice flavor better, but I will eat all 3 containers at one sitting(of the licorice). The spicy cinnamon is really fantastic and is spicy enough that I only eat a little bit at a time. :-)"
5,Yes We Are,"I was very interested in reading this book because I wanted to see why men act the way we do. The author is very accurate, and she should know--she raised two boys and I am sure they are schmucks, too."
4,Gift,"I am hoping my husband enjoys this book. He is a chef by trade, but really enjoys watching hell's kitchen and master chef to learn new tricks. So I am hoping he will enjoy this book for christmas. Fast shipping and even included tracking number. Excellent Conidition."
1,Hilariously Bad,"This book arrived in my boyfriend's house from somewhere. It's amazingly poorly written.There are all sorts of drinking games you could invent from this book- starting with drinking every time the main character describes a woman as ""impossibly slender and voluptuous"" or talks about how women are always trying to use him. Anytime the robotic horse shows up, anytime he mixes sci-fi and fantasy in a particularly horrible way (let us use radar to find the evil spellcaster...), anytime he puts in some wierdo debate about different forms of government written in psuedo medieval language. But you don't need to drink to read this, as reading it will make you feel like you took a potent cocktail of mind altering drugs.good for: LARPers, bitter lonely geeks, people who are bored of well written novels with narrative arcs.Bad for: people who are not tired of well written novels with narrative arcs and realistic characters."
5,A very cute toy for your little one,"I don't think anyone can say that humans weren't around when dinosaurs were unless they were around back then to tell about it now. That information comes from the same people that tell us we came from monkeys...and I'm no ape!Anyways, I think this toy has a lot of potential to spark your child's imagination. Little boys (and some girls) love dinosaurs and adding a cute little person in with it just makes it even more interesting.I don't think the size of the egg is any reason to knock off a point for educational value. It is made to fit the dinosaur and if it were the actual size it ""should"" be compared to the Momma dinosaur, then it would be a choking hazard. In order to create an ""accurate"" portrayal as this toy clearly does not (Lions, Tigers, and Bears, OH MY!), then the Dinosaur would have to be nearly three times its size for the smaller dinosaur and egg to be a safe size for babies and toddlers. I think we all know who needs the extra point for education."
5,Cute Dino Set,"This cute little dino is sure to be fun fro your little one. Blue brontosaurus comes with cute little baby in a peek-a-boo egg. Our 2 year old loves the set he got for his b-day, as does our 1 year old nephew who got a set for his b-day. We also love the quality of Fisher Price. Great toy for a great value!!!"
5,They love this!,"My 2 year old daughter got the brontosaurus for Christmas and adores them! They are one of the toys that must go everywhere with her. I plan on getting her the other two sets as well. They are durable, cute, and just the right size for her to play with. A nice bonus is that they are also big enough where I don't have to worry about her little brother (8 months) getting ahold of them because he can't choke/hurt himself with these.If your child loves Land Before Time they'll love these little guys too!I'd definitely recommend these to others and will buy them as gifts for friends/family who have small ones that like dinos too."
4,Cute,This is a good durable toy! Doesn't make noise which can be a good thing! I think my son will love it!!
4,Driver Wii,"My nephews love this game, I purchased it for them. They loved the one I own, so I got them one of their own. It is a bit graphic though. I need to have them play when my little one is not around."
4,"Great game, can't go wrong.","Driver wii turned out to be a great game. It was very enjoyable and a lot of fun. You definetely get into the action nicely. The controls are pretty standard = wii mote to shoot and nunchuck to steer/drive. It also features a control that lets you tilt the nunchuck for sharper turns although I havn't found this to be very useful. Overall, the game appears short. But it's really worth the ride."
3,"Excellent, simple and varied","For my children is one of the most entertaining games and used, but even for that is 8 years we have purchased and now Play II platform for WII"
4,Just like GTA.,"Identical to GTA, gets boring after 4-6 weeks, unless your still a GTA fan. They could have made it longer, the graphics are sweet on the Wii."
3,not a bad game,"its not a bad game, the controls are a little weird, hard to get used to, most of the missions are fun, its just one of tjhose games you are kinda neutral on"
3,purchased in error,"I ordered this for a child and didn't notice the rating. Luckily their father did and confiscated it. He said it's a good game for adults, but can only play when children aren't around.My mistake, I pay closer attention now."
5,review for driver parallel lines,helloyes driver: parallel lines was a very cool game like grand theft auto but a way cooler version and I like the time period that the game goes through the 70s to the 2000s I love the idea I think its awsome that I had the honor out of all the people that bought it that I got to play it thank keep those amazing idea coming the more chance you guy get pop those ideas outthanks againShelby T. Cook
4,good game,this is a very fun game. it is very similar to grand theft auto type games but it has a twist. free roam environment in new york/new jersey and customizable vehicles. i will never be bored of this game i would reccomend it to any wii owners. 17+
4,Hours of fun!,"My husband a big fan. He likes to drive the different types of cars. I am not a big fan of the hand brake feature, it hard to learn to use. It's fun for the fact i only paid $15.99 for it. We both like the story line and it is fun to do the little side jobs. Cops are fun to out run but watch out for the chopper it gets you everytime."
1,DRIVER:PL FOR Wii DOES NOT SUPPORT STEERING WHEEL,"I own this game on PS2 and it is awesome. Not as great as the original Driver, but close. However, ON Wii, THIS GAME SUCKS because YOU CANNOT USE ANY Wii STEERING WHEEL with this game. NO STEERING WHEELS AT ALL!ON the Wii version, THE VERY STUPID MAKERS OF THIS Wii VERSION of DRIVER PL, must have been taking drugs when thinking it would be better to use the Nanchuck for driving. Very stupid! Wish I would have known the steering wheel was not able to use before buying this game. Anyways, I love all the Driver games on Playstation, and this Wii version was a total dissapointment. The makers of this game need to get some brains and TAKE THE ORIGINAL DRIVER GAME (from the old original PS1 system) AND PUT DRIVER 1 ON Will for use with the Wii steering wheel. Like I said, ALL the Driver games on PS & PS2 are great. Including Parallel Lines. However Wii OWNERS BEWARE! Get this version of Driver for PS2 and NOT Wii!"
1,It looks good but I can't reverse the car!,"The graphic looks good compared to other Wii games. However, bad controlling scheme makes it un-playable. I can't reverse the car. The manual says ""Press Z-button and tilt the Nunchuck to make the car turn 360 degrees"" but it does not work at all. When the car I drove hit the wall and got stuck, I tried every movements with both the Wii controller and the Nunchuck but it was still stuck. I searched the Web for tips but none worked.After 2 days, I traded it in. It's very frustrating. I'm now conviced Wii controller DOES NOT WORK with ACTION games. I rented two other action games, Transformer and Dragon Quest Swords. They don't respond properly to Wii controller either."
1,OLD Parfum,"If this is White Linen by Estee Lauder, then it is VERY old. It STINKS like cheap Kmart perfume. Lesson learned."
5,love it!!,"This is a 1990 crisp edition of a book first issued in 1944, so it still has the vintage lettering on the cover, the drawings, and the attitude of the 1940's! Very cute. Many diagrams and clear drawings, good directions, for deciduous, citrus, etc. There are over 35 fruit trees listed, with explicit directions and drawings of how to trim each one.Cover is textured, interesting. Great deal, recommended."
2,Where's the creativity?,"Will Smith is a hack. For those who like his song, I suggest you try Stevie Wonder's ""I Wish"" on the ""Songs From the Key Of Life"" CD. Its a better version than Smith's."
3,Bailimos kicks butt majorly but the rest wasn't great.,Oh my gosh I just loved Bailimos and Wild wild west but the rest of the songs weren't as great. Actually the rest of the songs I didn't really listen to
3,O.K. Sound Track.,"As Far as sound tracks go, Wild Wild West is great! But as far as CD's go, it has alot to be desired! It has wonderful performances by; Will Smith; Dru Hill; Enrique; Dr. Dre; and Eminem. (Wild Wild West; Bailamos; and Bad Guys Always Die) But after that the rest is mostly junk."
1,boring overhyped movie with awful overhyped song,"every year a big budget film comes out and some rap artist has to put out a song for it that is #1 on the charts before its even released. will smith is the nerdiest rapper on earth. this song is stupid as hell! the begining will make you claw your face out! the dumb 80's rap sounding bass thing come in and will starts saying wicky wicky wild wild, AAAAHHHHH! that is so incredibly annoying i could go out and torture him to death and think nothing of it. and the chorus is no better, some rather homosexual sounding guy with a whiney voice starts saying something like, were going, reeaaat tooo, the wild wild wild wild wild wild west. this song will be forgotten and buried within 3 months. right along with the MC hammer addams family song. that was another dumb overrated movie with a idiotic song but fans of will smith would not remember it because they where too young."
1,Jeez - it's a pile of smelly trash,"Oh my god - what was I thinking? I bought the CD on the strength of ""Baliamos"" figuring that there would at least be another couple of good songs on it. As if! It's all ghetto tribe music for the homies which I have tried listening to and given up. Avoid at all costs!"
4,Good Jams,Lots of good songs and of course the Wild Wild West song is the best song on a soundtrack I have heard in a while. I would buy this CD if I was you it's well worth it!!!!
4,top-notch soundtrack,"i believe that this might be one of the best soundtracks that i have heard in recent memory- smith/hill/kool mo de give the sountrack a strong start, and it continues throughout the whole album- no punches pulled here, very stong and powerful artists perform- all have great rythym- i strongly suggest this soundtrack"
5,this is an awesome cd!,"this is so awesome i am gonna get 2morrow when it comes out june 15 and i think it is cool how there are different people that sing on the cd like eminem, blackstreet and tatyana ali like i said before get this cd and it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOOOOOL"
2,Okay,"This soundtrack is okay. The first three songs are great, but then it goes downhill with songs that all sound basically the same. I got this CD early, and I was really excited, but it was awful after track 3."
4,HIP MIX OF X-GEN TUNES,"YOUV'E MANAGED TO PUT TOGETHER A CD WORTH PLAYING FROM START TO FINISH! MOST OF THE MOVIE SOUNTRACKS OF LATE ALWAYS HAVE AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR ""SLEEPERS"" THAT YOU HAVE TO FAST FORWARD.I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE HERE ANY GENERATION WILL ENJOY."
2,Buy the singles,"Will Smith and Dru Hill have created an excellent cover song to what will be a huge summer movie hit. Wild Wild West is awesome, and Enrique Iglesias can be commended for at least choosing a gorgeous woman to be in his video. Beyond this, however, the rest of the CD disappoints. Save yourself a few bucks and go buy Will Smith's Wild Wild West track as a single. You aren't missing out on anything!!"
1,The title track needs to die.,"I'm not kidding. It's music like ""(Wicky) Wild Wild West"" that are ruining mainstream music. C'mon! Practically all of his songs are remakes or what-not! Any time I hear that annoying song - I say ""turn that off before I break my foot off in your...You get the picture."
3,"What's so ""Wild Wild West"" about it?","Don't get me wrong, I liked this CD. But it was so anoying that none of this music was in the movie. They must of just wanted to make more money from this movie because of the lousy sales the movie was getting. This CD is just there. Nothing to do with the movie. The producers should be ashamed."
5,Bad Guys Always Die- THE BEST!,"This is a great cd!Will Smiths theme song is great, bailamos is good, But Dre and Eminems Bad Guys Always Die is the greatest!!!!BUY THIS CD!!!!!!"
1,Horrible!&as Bad as the Film,This Is as Bad as The Film.in Fact Just Like The FIlm The Soundtrack is the same old Formula.Will&His Movies&Music Never change the same Old Beat.The Rest Of The Soundtrack is just as bad.UNORIGINAL&BORING.What A Waste of KOOL MOE DEE?
3,"Better than the movie,but still pretty average overall","I had high hopes for this album (a killer title track and a pretty good selection of RnB artists)but really after the first few tracks...well you`ve heard it all before.The supposed Western theme in the music is uneven to say the least and Will Smith could have sung a few more songs himself. Still, it`s got to be better than the movie - save yourself the money and watch the music video of the title song!Now that`s hot!"
2,Not what I expected,"I got this CD and was very disappointed. After Wild Wild West and Bailamos, the rest of the songs are not as good. The first two get your attention and make you move, but the rest just make me skip to the next song after the first few seconds. I have had this CD since it came out and still can't make myself listen to the whole thing."
1,Poor translation of Plotinus,"Plotinus is a philosopher worth digesting but not in this 19th century indigestible translation by Stephen MacKenna. Book publishers often use old translations regardless of quality, so that they can go to print without paying the long-dead translator.A good translation reads smoothly and clearly, as if the book had been originally written in English. It should not sound like this stilted gobbledygook from MacKenna in III.2.14 (p 149):""In this demand for more good than exists, there is implied a failure to recognize that the form allotted to each entity is sufficient in itself; it is like complaining because one kind of animal lacks horns."" Whaaaat????Could MacKenna be trying to say something like: ""All forms are perfect as created. Demanding something better than exists is like saying an animal without horns is inferior to one with horns.""Don't buy this inferior Penguin version of Plotinus but keep shopping."
4,"Good Price and Music, but ""Esoteric"" Workbook.","Good selection of music and one can't beat the price! But, opening the workbook/(cd cover)on the ""application and procedure"" by Dr. Annette Bauer, I quickly understood why the word ""esoteric"" is in the title! The language used is like reading a brief scientific explanation for the effects of listening to music, but the words and concepts are rarely defined! Anyhew, nice music and price but superficial workbooks..."
2,PREVAIL INCONTINENCE PADS,Tena works much better. Use pads for my senior dog inside his fabric diaper and prevail leaked through. Better to buy Tena for overnight or Poise Maxi.
1,Junk,I bought these googles for my daughter to use for her summer swim team. She only had them for 3 weeks when they broke in the middle of a swim meet. Will never buy anthing made by lane 4 again.
1,Never worked,"Loading the program never got any farther than entering your name to start playing. As soon as we entered a name and clicked ""Start"" it went back to desktop screen. We tried various ways to make it work but it always quit and went back to the desktop screen. We returned the software."
1,I don't call this humor,"This book, despite the other 2 reviews that loved it, left much to be desired when it comes to humor. I don't find this type of humor funny at all. But, I don't find Saturday Night Live funny either and that is the type of humor that is here. I did find one part funny, the script from the Mary Tyler Moore show where she loses control at Chucky the Clown's funeral, but the rest of the book was just stupid."
4,Really Nice!,"I liked it and it took a very long time in finding this album ironically for one song but, it was well worth the wait."
4,Integration of e-business components,"A very insightful and lucid analysis of the components comprising an e-business strategy.Although the book gives you an introduction to these, it does not say much on on how all these components will interact and coordinate ? What kind of information flow will be between these components?It would have been great if a case study detailing these interactions, had been included in the book."
4,Excellent Overview of e-business Transformation,"I have used this book as a text in three classes at UCLA. The class is e-business, Transform Your Compay Now. The students found it an excellent overview of the total picture. No other book I have seen does such a good job of explaining the basics of e-business.I am also a full time e-business consultant for a major company. The book is out of date and needs an update. The basics are there but e-markets are taking off as is wireless e-business. I believe these writers could do an excellent sequel if one is not already in the works."
4,For dummies and middle-range executives.,"This is an excellent opportunity for people that want to be introduced in the new concepts and paradigms in the new economies. It`s also well focused on all the posibilities new technologies are offering. If you don`t know anything about this posibilities, or want to explore new ones, this is your book. If you are already an IT manager, or an expert in this field, don`t even bother to read it."
1,"a waste of paper, the trees could have been put to a better","We were FORCED to buy this book as part of our e-commerce paper at university. I found it full of dumb buzzwords eg. ""e-supply chain fusion"" which I'm sure will help me get a job when I go for an interview with companies like SAP or PWC, but where's the meat ? Having worked for companies who implement B2B and supply chain management solutions (always on-time & UNDER budget) I wonder if Dr Ravi Kalakota has actually worked in the REAL world ? It's sad that upper management read these books then go out and spend millions of dollars on solutions which always end up being buggy, behind schedule and so complex that they need to hire in other consultants just to come in and fix things."
2,My 5th grader could have done this,"Did we really need another book that says the same old thing? The authors get points for bringing a lot of issues & concerns with eBusiness together. They lose more points in originality, continuity, and foresight which all seem to be non-existent. The book is a decent primer for eBusiness if you lack general knowledge, but fails to provide any indepth knowledge or principles for true value."
4,Helpful to me.Thank to the author!,"I have not very much to say.I haven't look this book,but I read the details at Amazon.com.Just like scanning and skipping the book.I am a beginner for study E-Business.In our country,most of this kind of books are made of ""clipper and glue"".I am very appreciate contacting the original ideas of E-Business."
3,If it was only that simple,"Kalakota and Robinson have written a worthwhile text, however it is really at a very strategically broad level. The picture painted is very rosy indeed. The problem is that the real world does not allow the sort of product integration assumed, nor can implementation be achieved at the speed necessary to meet with the authors expectations. Overall an interesting view from the top. Not a book for those looking to actually achieve an end result in the e-business systems implementation arena."
2,Old Hat on the New World,"After a promising first few chapters on gearing your business to the e-commerce, the roadmap for success becomes a maze of disaster. It strikes me as similar to early maps of the earth - when the world was flat.The book loses its vision and becomes bogged down in process and planning. Such a subjective approach not only fails to deliver a clear map for planning but also fails to allow for further change in an ever-changing environment.Publications on e are becoming common as muck. Whilst starting well, this falls somewhere between vision and process without reconciling the two. A must for second-rate managers. Enjoy!"
5,Absolutely Right On!,"I am a CIO of a large company and this is the first book on the ""e"" subject that has any depth. The authors present a systematic roadmap to building out the ""e"" infrastructure. They seem to understand the business aligment problem -- that established companies have IT and business assets that they cannot discard as advocated by some ""so-called"" gurus.If you are part of a large company developing an e-business strategy, this book is for you. It forces you to think about large scale application investments systematically."
1,"Inadequate, messy, and hype","I have read many e-commerce books, this one is part of my school recommended text and that is why I need to read it from cover to cover, else I would have threw it out few chapters later.It's a badly organised book that throw a bunch of IT-driven business concepts that has been around for many years, slap an 'e-' in front of it, and call it a 'e-business' book. It tries to depict 'e-business' to be everything, and teach nothing, tells you what you should do, but doesn't tell you how you could possibly do it, it tells you whats wrong in many business process, but does not tell you what is the solution. Most of the time, the answer will lead back to vaguely say 'you need integrated enterprise application' or 'you need to change'.I would prefer more focus and realistic books that does not pretend to be everything like those by Patricia B. Seybold, etc.."
4,The E-Compendium for all types of business,"The book is providing hands-on information on almost every aspect of e-anything. I actually can't see any area, which was left out. I would have appreciated a larger part on e-banking, but the amount of information is more than satisfying to me. The only reason this book has 4 out of 5 is the quality of the cover, which is not the fault of the author, but of the publisher. But this shouldn't stop anyone from buying the book."
1,"A theoretical ""Roadmap for Success""","While the book may be an interesting read, Mr Kalakota launched a company called Hsupply.com which failed after one year and closed in November 2000 blaming lack of available funding. Afterwards Mr Kalakota stated ""I thought I knew a lot"". Enough said..."
2,Lots of big words and no explanation of what they mean,"After seeing all the glowing reviews of this book, I'm beginning to wonder if it's just me. I've only gotten through the first 3 chapters and already I've run into a multitude of terms that are not explained at all. My class uses this book for its text and I have to answer discussion questions about brand-intensive vs. capital intensive, disaggregation and reaggregation (Dictionary.com didn't even have 'reaggregation' in its database), etc. It sure would be nice to include a glossary of terms used. I'm really dreading the rest of this book."
3,"ONLY ONE Chart useful, while worth 3 stars ALONE",The chart illustrate enterprise e-business functional building-block is extremly useful. While other part is just so so.
5,Simply Incredible,"I have heard a number or arrangements for this piece, and this one is far and away the best. It is certainly one of my top three albums in the world. Not only is the story amazing, but the instrumentation is authentically medieval and the soloists have obviously studied Middle Eastern voice technique ( by the way, the voices are stunningly beautiful). You don't get much better than the Andrew Laurence-King Harp Consort, and in my opinion, this is thier capstone work. The album is worth any amount of money."
4,"Great mellow tone, albeit fragile!","The Jim Dunlop 202 provides a fabulous mellow tone for both electric and acoustic play. I'm a very ""normal"" looking right-handed American male of 5'10"" height, average weight and build, and the 202 fits my left ring finger perfectly. If your hands are at all stalky/thick, however, plan on using your little finger instead.I've also had the displeasure of shattering one while playing live on stage. (The slide fell off a music stand to a cement floor three feet below, and shattered on impact.) So just be cognizant that this IS made of *thin* glass, and you must treat it more delicately than your porcelain and metallic slides to avoid such heartbreak. :("
3,Clear sound - but don't drop it,"Clear sounding slider works pretty good in the studio. I did drop it a couple times (ok, maybe more than a couple) on the wood floors of stages without a problem. Then one day, in the frigidly cold outdoors, I dropped it on a concrete floor and it completely shattered, oops."
2,Good sound... VERY TINY STORAGE,"I was happy to find an MP3 shower radio. I was not happy that the flash storage that it comes with is only 32MB.. What the heck am I going to do with a 32MB flash drive.I figured when I bought it that I could just by another flash drive roughly the same physical size as the one they include in this mp3 player..Unfortunatly it didn't work. Not because it wouldn't fit, or that the USB device itself is physically unique, it isn't. The softare however and the storage format of the Pavit is. You have to install the Pavit software to transfer mp3's from your computer to the Pavit format. DON'T LOSE THE CD.. if you do and you have to reinstall, you are ... you know.This would be bearable if I could put songs in the Pavit format on my own USB drive... NOPE. You HAVE to use a PAVIT usb storage device. Which brings me back to 32MB!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME????"
2,Battery guzzler,"A fair radio for an environment with moisture. Reception and sound are fair, not good. Biggest disappointments are the draining of the batteries (with short use...only when I'm showering or using lavatory in morning may last one week) and flash drive is too small (5 mp3 songs?) and difficult to setup. The controls are difficult to operate...tiny and not very sensitive.The case/housing for the radio is beautiful and better looking than the online photo. The durable plastic looks great in any contemporary bathroom."
5,Never Gets Old!!,We got this as a gift when our twins were born...almost six years ago!! Their cassette just broke and I was so glad to find it here...they still go to sleep to it most nights and LOVE IT!
1,It would be good if it didn't suck so bad.,"I bought this case with high hopes of keeping my DS system in mint condition. Intec made quite sure that this would be an impossible task.The metal clasp that keeps the case closed isn't reinforced on the inside, so any added pressure inadvertently scratches the cover of my DS. What I bought to protect my system ended up being the one thing that hurt it the most.Curse you Intec."
4,DS Security,"There is just so much success Nintendo has had in the past year with the highly acclaimed Nintendo DS. But, trying to find the right place to store your DS can be a very difficult thing, especially if you want to maintain it for a good future use. This leather case is a stylish, convient and compact way to put your system in, without worrying about the wear and tear if it gets damages or scratched. I like it because it is convient and simple to store. If you own a Nintendo DS, this might be a smart purchase for you to make, if you want it to be safe from any accidents.Price: B+"
3,TOO SMALL,"This case is very nice quality, but is way TOO SMALL. There is no place for games, let alone accessories. I would recommend one of the cases that holds games and accessories instead."
5,Perfectly sized for DS,"Unlike some Ohio Valley mothers I actually use a Nintendo DS and don't just pre judge items from the outside of the package. This leather case is perfectly well sized for the mobile gamer, It holds my system and games just fine attaches to my belt and was built for the target audience of the Nintendo DS teens and adults not five year old kids that have to go on weekend stays at grandmas house and need to bring along a slew of power adapters. Since cables and other accessories aren't required for the system to communicate with other gamers it is not only stylish but simplistic in purpose."
4,Wonder About the DS...,"Wonder where you could put the Nintendo DS? In the Nintendo DS Leather Case! It's big enough for the DS and any other Gameboy System you want to put in there. Maybe a few games could fit in there too. I recommend these games,Spider Man 2Super Mario 64Madden Football 2005Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005I hope this review helped you!The DS reviewer"
3,"careful, this one may interfere with HD signals","Unfortunately, not all coax cable splitters are the same. The frequency range supported does matter, since cable companies are now using higher frequencies in their signals.This one specifies 5-900MHz, which is likely to cause problems with your HD channels. Most frequently, some channels won't come through, or you may see a lot of ""digital noise"". (I've seen the problems, and verified that the splitter is the culprit, by removing the splitter.)You may want to get a splitter with a wider frequency range ..."
2,Not the best splitter,I noticed a lot of noise and ocasionally complete signal loss when using this splitter with HD channels (it seemed to have some issues with digital channels as well). So if you plan on using this splitter with HD channels - don't.
1,FLAMES,Well flames didn't come out of it but it was melting. The light bulb was melting the plastic flower and if it would have happened at night problems could have been worse. NOT recommended.
3,Like unpopped kernels? Then this is for you.,"After reading a web review that I thought came from the Washington Post (but can no longer find), I was disappointed to find that this popcorn did not behave as expected. There were many unpopped kernels, which suggested to me that it was not very fresh. Indeed, when opening the caps, the seals on many of the bottles were not firmly glued on. There was no sound of air rushing in as I opened them. The flavors indeed had promise, but I think that my old standby, Petite Princess Amber, still wins as the best popcorn notwithstanding the Washington Post review."
5,great book for the pest control professional,I love this book and I am able to reaqlly use it and get better control of mice problems and understanding the rats and mice it is great I am a pest control tech and this book is great and the author is awsome i have heard him speak and he really knows his stuff is is great!
3,Okay Series - So So plot; Awesome Music,I don't think this series is as great as people make it seem. The best thing about this series is the weird animation and soundtrack. The plot is okay but didn't strike me with any provoking thoughts. I finished the series because I wanted to see how it ended and it was just so weird in the beginning that I couldn't just not finish it. I would watch/borrow this first before buying... and maybe buy the bootleg just to have something weird to show off.
5,"FLCL (""Fooly Cooly"") Is the Best of Anime Available!","An adolescent boy, living in a quiet river town in which nothing ever happens, sees his world turned inside out when he encounters a dangerous, and seductive, guitar playing alien on a Vespa Scooter. She strikes a blow, which causes a robot to spring from his forehead and, when a satellite falls to earth, threatening to destroy the quiet river town, he knocks it out of the ballpark with the mighty stroke of his guitar, revealing himself as the Pirate King. Remarkable? The key to fully enjoying this animated masterpiece is to remember that we are looking through the eyes of a man/child struggling to come to terms with a world that is, at times, maddeningly confusing. The artwork, the animation, the dialogue, the music, the homage to Lupin III and South Park, make this Three (3) Volume Series a ""must have"" addition to your video collection."
3,"Actually, I don't know","I like Naruto, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, Samurai 7, The Princess of Tennis, Wolf Rain and etc. I don't like Inuyasha. I have tried 3 times to watch this FLCL - which is one of the most popular series. I stopped during the 1st episode because I didn't understand anything. 6 months passed...... I tried to watch again last week. During episode 4, I fell asleep. Ok..... I was thinking.... ????. Again, yesterday, I finished watching the last 2 episodes which should give me the answer based on the other people reviews. But I didn't get any answer. I am so sure that I am missing ""something"". I love the song very much. :)"
5,Great great anime,"This is by far my favorite anime, and though at first you WON'T understand the plot (this is almost a guarantee) but eventually it will dawn on you. To figure out the significance of the show, you have to pay attention to every spoken line, if you do this, you will learn how complex the series is. I may as well go ahead and tell you now so you don't have to watch it 20 times like i did, being a millenium anime the show revolves around armegeddon (through multiple references to things like Nostradamus and a ""god"" of the black flame, and one other that escapes me). Anyone who says that there is no plot/purpose and they dont understand it hasnt watched it enough, or was biased against to begin with. Definitely a great buy, well worth the price.If only there were a box set. . ."
1,What a waste of money.,I purchased this along with the Logitech force steering wheel. This thing is worthless. The portion you fit between your legs isn't long enough to securely hold itself no matter how hard you squeeze your legs together. It totally defeats the purpose of having the wheel to begin with and you completely lose the ability to drive with any sort of accuracy because it flops around so much. I used it for about an hour and threw it across the room.
1,Too small and unstable.,This thing is too small for anyone bigger than an eight year old. Also it is a very poor design very unstable. Needs something under your legs to hold it in place. Do not buy this you will return it.
1,This lap attachment needs a serious redesign...,"The lap attachment would have been incredibly useful if the base (the part that you squeeze between your legs) would have been longer. It seems like it would be better suited for a child. If you are over 6' tall and weigh over 200 lbs., you probably would be better off trying to clamp your Driving Force wheel to a table.I sincerely hope that Logitech redesigns the next lap attachment with full-grown adults in mind."
2,helpful but not the best,I bought this along with the steering wheel for my husband. I thought it would be perfect because he sits in front of the tv in a rolly chair to play his games. Not so good. Not very stable for steering. He complains that it slides out from between his legs and seems like to much work to hang on to.
1,Not Worth the Money,"When I saw this I thought it was the perfect solution to holding my PS2 driving wheel (Since I do not have it close to a table). I was wrong this just makes its bulky and even more difficult to hold, not at all what I expected. Truth be told the best thing for a true driving experience (in your living/family room) is a playseat, but at three hundred bucks, a TV table may be the best value!"
2,Logitech lap attachment,"Poor design!! The bottom of the unit where it connects to the steering wheel has uneven hard plastic pieces that irritate the thighs after using the system for a while. You also must stabilize the unit by holding your thighs together as opposed to other manufacturers that drape over your lap. I guess in a way you can get some ""thigh master"" exercises at the same time your playing a game."
1,still nothing!!!!,"the delivery stimate was from 7 - 11 December... still nothing!!!!that's how ""fast"" the delivery was...veeery disapponting..."
2,Don't buy it for networking a printer,"This device functions on my network, and can be accessed wirelessly through the router. However, when attempting to use the ""built-in print server"" after connecting my USB printer to it, it simply does not work. There is no support for this device, and little documentation. From the web interface menu, a list of EPSON usb printers is available, however, that brand/model centric caveat is not referenced in the marketing on the box, on the web, nor any other media specific to this device. Another annoying limitation of this device is access to read/write your files requires direct use of proprietary software, rather than simply mounting it as a network drive. If you maintain very low expectations for this device, you will not be disappointed."
2,Answer key...but VERY inaccurate,"My version does indeed have an answer key. However, the answers and the exercises do not match up well. The answer key appears to be extremely badly edited or reviewed for accuracy...to the point of being almost useless. Which, of course, made me wonder what other parts of the book are inaccurate.....I was excited about this book until I realized how ""off"" the answer key is."
2,What good is a workbook without the answers?,"Unless you have a live in Spanish teacher, don't waste your money on this workbook. The exercises are actually very good, but if you are like me, it will infuriate you to discover there is no answer key.Duh, if I knew what my mistakes were, would I be wasting my money on a workbook? ""Advanced Spanish Grammar"" by Marcial Prado; ""Practice Makes Perfect Spanish Verb Tenses"" by Dorothy Richmond; and The ""Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice"" by Gordon and Stillman all have answer keys and all are EXCELLENT!"
1,Spanish Grammar in Review,I agree with the other reviews! I was infuriated to buy this book and then realize it had no answer key. Don't waste your money.
2,"Could Be a ""5 Star"" ... Had Answers Been Included","This book would be a wonderful resourse if it had included an answer key for the exercises. I think it would rate 5 stars if this were the case. I love the layout, and the fact that the lessons are concise and well explained. But for one who is attempting to learn Spanish on their own, this book is useless without having an ""answer key"" or a Spanish teacher handy to check your answers."
1,Buy another book.,"Save your money and don't buy this book. There are other better spanish review book out there to buy. There are too many mistakes especially in the answer key. It is nice to have an answer key, but only if it accurate."
2,Poor design leads to a waste of money,"Do not buy this action figure! It is of a poor quality - Batman's feet were not properly designed, and so the figure's legs will warp and bend, making him unable to stand correctly.The Mattel Batman figures from the Batman line are much better, and properly constructed. So collect the rest of the Justice Leaguers, and get one of the two-packs for your Mattel Batman."
2,Don't bother!,"This movie is a disgrace to Mary Higgins Clark and to Lesley-Anne Down. I read the other reviews before purchase, but I ignored them. There were too many story lines, and some of them were unbelievable. I was extremely disappointed."
1,Lost in Translation,"I didn't read the book but I did listened to the audio book. I found it interesting though it was a bit hard to determine which character was saying what. So I bought this dvd. The screenplay was worst than the audio book script. You could follow who was saying what but chunks of the story were missing. I expected a Cliff Note compression of the book and audio book, not a total gutting of them. Basically it's a ""Straight to Video"", Soap Opera-ish B-movie. With all of the cable channels out there I can't think of one that would pay money to air this. Not even a community access tv station in need of free programming!Mary Higgins Clark: You Belong to Me"
2,Scooby doo,"I was disappointed with this costume because of the design, it bunched in the crotch and the butt and made it look like it was too small even though it wasnt. The only thing the costume had going for it is that it did make you look like Scooby Doo"
1,G.O.B.'s theme,"All you need to know is that ""Final Countdown"" is the music that plays whenever G.O.B. does one of his magic acts on Arrested Development."
2,All because of Gob Bluth...,"I had forgotten completely about the title track until I saw Arrested Development. It was the episode where Gob was attempting to be buried in a trick casket. This was preceded by ""The Final Countdown"" and some dancing; F-ing brilliant.I found a copy of this tape for like 50 cents. It was worth every penny.The best thing to do is listen to, like, the first minute and 12 seconds of ""The Final Countdown"", rewind, and do it all over again..."
5,Ninja,"The band Europe is one of the greatest bands of all time. They mixed pop like vocals which made the songs catchy and the amazing guitar riffs in the back. John Norum the groups guitar player is the greatest guitar player ive ever heard, especially in the two solos of the song ninja and every other solo on the record two. This record is worth the money! Dont pass it up!"
4,The Catchiest Song Ever?,"I grew up listening to Europe, granted they were not the heaviest rockers of the 80's but that was fine. Europe had harmonies, something that was lacking in most of the Metal Bands. Joey Tempest had a great voice and is a terrefic songwriter evident on this whole album. Hey writng good pop is not easy. If you want a headbanging album, you will be dissapointed, if you want to hear catchy songs and a great ballad ""Carrie"" get this album. The funny thing is that most of the reviews I read so far on this album are right, this is not their best stuff. Very enjoyable nevertheless"
1,Negative stars would be more just,"This is probably the most sinister of all 80's 'metal' albums. I agree that it is not fair to call this a metal album, not because of the band;s nationality but because the music is pure drollish hack-pop that weeds its way into your brain like the most lethal of cancers. I grew up in the era when this disk saw heavy radio play, and even at that tender age I was fortunate to realize what drivel this was. No matter what your musical taste I would warn you to steer way clear of this. Contracting the plague may be worse than listening to this album but not by much."
1,What?,"You all are kidding, right? You like this!?Still, I give it one star (although Amazon should consider the use of quater stars) because it makes me laugh."
5,One of my fovrate metal bands,"This album has the rare distinction for me in that I enjoy all of the songs on it. The music has a good edge and is played with energy and excitement. For those who really like to rock, this is a good album to crank up. Most of the songs tell stories, some historical, and some fictional. My own favorite songs are, The Final Countdown, Ninja, and Cherokee."
4,Great Album,"This is a great album from this era of music. The live tracks sound surprisingly good, though I would have preferred the inclusion of a live version of ""Rock the Night"". Overall though, a must have for any collector of 80's hard rock."
4,Woooahhhhh,"To you doubters, go screw yourself.This is far from my favourite album, but its metal! A form of POP metal at that, but if you disagree I dont give a toss and I believe you're lookin in the wrong section.Go listen to that gangsta crap. Or whatever. If you like great heavy metal, pop metal, glam, rock n' roll etc this is a great example and something you should definately try. The final countdown ruled when the world was a better place so let it rule your world today...."
5,The Final Countdown,"I have this CD in the form of a pirate copy, and I love to listen to the title track. It's my favorite. I can't stop singing it wherever I go. They hear me and they don't know what I'm singing, but I explain them I'm just singing the title track of this CD.Indeed, I'll give it a ten. It has good vocals, great drums, great bass, a great synth in the title track and it's great overall.I'm sure that, if you like hard rock, you'd love this CD."
4,Napa travels,"I am a resident of the Bay area, and yet found hidden treasures in Napa and Sonoma thanks to this well written and organized book."
1,BLECH!!!,"If you like MHC and this book, stay far, far away from this DVD.This movie is indescribably horrible. The casting is like something out of a bad episode of ""Silk Stalkings."" The character names have been changed to distracting but similar names like ""Laurie Kenmon"" and ""Billy Hawkins."" Bic has a German accent, Greg seems creepier than the kidnappers and the actress who plays Laurie apparently thought that yelling would be a good way to show that her alter personalities were speaking.Awful. Insipid."
1,Won't even drain the dishes,So thin I had to add a weed barrier liner; much smaller than the dimensions quotes. Don't buy these!
2,"Beautiful voices, but some songs sounded alittle to country.","I thought the CD was ok. Fhear a Bhata was a beautiful song, and also Donegal Rain. I am frustrated thou because I cannot find the lyrics to either of those songs. I play guitar and love to play irish folk music."
1,Ogletree has admitted to plagiarism!,Charles J. Ogletree has admitted to word for word plagiarism on the Harvard University website! Research before you buy..
2,Kinda yucky,"For years I have tried to eat healthy things that were made to taste like the unhealthy things that I crave. This is one of those purchases. I was hoping to satisfy my desire for morning crunch with Smaps and was simply not satisfied. They've got crunch--crunch like corn nuts! It was sort of like eating bb's. Try them for yourself, it's not a big investment, you may find them extremely fulfilling. I, myself, will just have to learn to crave the healthy foods that my body needs and not the satisfaction my mind searches for."
5,~*rated wit jus hearing 2 songs*~,"i heard crystal sierra on the tv show soul train, they r mad hot... but they don't even have an official site yet.."
4,Saw the Video In Bogota,"I saw the video in Bogota and it is hot as the last reviewer says. I will miss it cause I'm in the midwest and never see latin music until I travel. But, the song sticks with you. Its really good I haven't heard anything else off the CD. But I can still see the video in my head from a month ago. What a babe."
1,"No longer the Clan, just another electro-dance cd","I was really on a Clan of Xymox kick until I purchased this album. After Twist of Shadows, Medusa, and Phoenix (mentioned in order of preference), I was truly disappointed and saddened that they no longer had their own original sound, but instead sounded like any other redundant electronic dance band. If you happen to enjoy electronic dance music then you may in fact enjoy this album."
5,One of the most underrated singers ever,"One of main problems with many greatest hits albums is that they only cover one label. Tanya Tucker is a case in point. The only greatest hits albums she's ever released have been incomplete because she has jumped from Columbia to MCA to Capitol, recording solid hits for all three, and never having all the hits in one set. That, I'm happy to say, has changed with this one. This is a must-have."
4,Puppy love,My dog loves these & I think our lawn looks better. Obviously I haven't tried them myself but the texture is nice and light.
2,Not what I expected,"This book was described as being a workbook to help plan your goals. I thought that it would be full of tips and strategies about goal-setting, and lead me through a step-by-step process. In fact, this book is nothing more than a blank journal to write goals in. It has space to write the goal, steps for achieving, and notes. There are also star-stickers in the back to put on the page when the goal has been achieved. While this book has a lovely cover, and makes for a pretty journal, it is not at all what I expected and hasn't been very useful to me."
3,don't know?,"Well, to be quite honest, I haven't heard this album....or any of their CD's.... But i've heard them live! The Robustos are really awesome and their singer has a really beautiful voice. A great match for this band would be Issac Green and the Skalars.Furthermore, since I haven't heard the album, i can't really judge 'it' that well...hence, the 3 stars. But as far as actually hearing them live, they deserve the full 5!"
4,Cute and fun,"I bought this game for my 5 yrs old daughter.The game only works on XP, it's not a new game.But it's still cute and fun for little girls.The game teaches kids to solve problem with their creativity.Like collect ingredient from river, make the orange felling from the branches safely. And build a cake house with all kinds of cookie and candy.The themes are simple but cute enough for little girls.The only insufficiency is the activity is few, only 4.That's why I give it 4 stars."
3,So-So,"The book was pretty good with the information that it did give. Some of the programs that were discussed in the book were not on the disk like the book said they were. Alot was left out and not touched upon like they should have been. There should have been a short section on Device drivers, just to give a reader an overview that they do exist, and maybe a little on installable file systems. I bought this book because the code was written in Assembler. I probably should have bought FreeDos instead except that is was written in C. All the information that I could not find in this book I found in the Code for Free Dos."
5,"The ""My Fair Lady"" of 1909","This set is quite a delight. I have known some of the music from earlier recordings, but this is the first complete recording. All the ""missing"" bits are well worth it running to 2 CD's. Part Gilbert & Sullivan, part Edwardian Music Hall, this show still sparkles. This recording does it entire justice, and it isn't hard to understand how it was the rage of London in 1909. This is a must have for anyone who loves historic music theater."
5,it has it all,"at first it seemed like i had played this game before . grand theft auto. but it does have a nice twist. this game is a combination of grand theft auto , pursuit force and a live action comic book. the graphics are great and there is enough intense game play to hold your attention it also has a nice time travel twist as it takes you back to 1976 . one of the best games out there now. christian j nielsen"
1,Buyer Beware,"This game while it should be an extremely fun game is absolutely marred by some of the worst programing the psp has ever seen. If you own a psp slim, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, it will freeze up on you. Simply put if you want to buy a game that does not work right then Driver '76 is for you, if you want to save your hard earned cash and put it towards another worthwhile psp game that you can actually play, the psp has a vast library of worthwhile titles."
2,"""Not So Great""","I was pleased with the way this jacket looked, no problem there. But, after wearing it for 3 hours (& never even washing it), most of the fake white jewels all fell off. I would not recommend it, POOR quality...."
4,"When I listen to this, I feel like I'm at a Jewish wedding.",The music makes me feel happy and I play it while doing housework. I dance my way through vaccuuming.
2,"Choppy, and incredibly dry","I used this book with a human development course at my university, and it was less than adequate for the job. The book is incredibly bland, and while it goes through the life span in order, it seems to jump around from different people's theories too much. Better if all of Piaget's ideas were presented together for a certain topic, etc.. On top of that, I believe that the method of citing the sources, while it works for research papers, seemed out of place in this setting. Numbered footnotes would have worked better. The method of citation used made it seem choppy, as all of a sudden you'd see a last name and a year in the middle of the text. This could be done more effectively, because the current method definitely broke up the text significantly. Hopefully, some of these changes will be implemented in a future edition."
2,Hafix: The Scent of Life CD,"I was disappointed in this CD. I'd hoped for a series of gentle readings of Hafiz's wonderful poetry, something to listen to at night or during meditation. Unfortunately, the accompanying music is loud and shrill and dominates. This is more a CD of eastern music with snatches of Hafiz in between than the other way round."
1,Delivery,"I know the product well. This product was to be a gift for my hosts in Chile. I selected the fastest delivery option. However, delays in delivery meant the product did not arrive (and may still not have arrived) until long after I had left. This really spoiled the gift-giving and thwarted my intentions. The estimated delivery date was wrong by several hundred percent.As I parceled several gifts in one package this comment applies five times!"
2,Where's fela?,"Fela fans will probably recognize this format of release - two songs that use the collective improvisitory facility of his entire brilliant band to draw them out.However, the first song doesn't even sound like Fela is on it! There are actually a number of records bearing his name that he is absent from. Few of them live up to the name.The second song, though, sounds like a standard, relentless Fela-style groove, complete with horn assault, but I wouldn't call it his best work.This release is part of the reason the box set came out - there are so many average Fela records - and they wanted to put the best versions of the best songs on one record.Not a bad idea, but why only two discs?Anyway, We'd probably all be better off with copies of Original Sufferhead, Black Man's Cry (both on shanachie,) or the box set!May he never be forgotten."
3,GREAT MUSIC BUT........,"This collabaration is great first off, plenty of music listen to .But I received a burned copy of an original!!The volume on the disc is too low.I advise anybody to question the seller on sound quality on this any cd but especially on this disc because of this being a ""Classic""."
5,NOT FOR THE GRAMMATICALLY CHALLENGED...,Those who are sticklers for good grammar will appreciate this bumper sticker. Others will not have a clue as to what this bumper sticker is all about.
4,"Sources, not answers","Taylor offers us an invigorating critique of the Western individualist tradition since the 17th century. His work focuses on how the Judeo-Christian tradition has been dismantled bit-by-bit as rationality has taken its place. This dynamic has left us with a ""desiccated"" self (e.g., no role for spirituality or grace). Taylor tells us that what is missing are powers of creative imagination and the substantive goods of ordinary life, but he does not reconcile these with the developments he critiques. Instead of sending us back to our religious roots or offering a new perspective, he leaves us asking the question we had on page 1: what gives life meaning in the 21st century."
1,Doesn't fit,"I received the podcast kit in a very timely manner however when I tried to put it together the microphone didn't fit the stand that was sent. I've been doing musical recording and demos and such and have a few websites that I'm using to advertise for non profits. I'm a brain cancer patient and I also enjoy singing and have created a way to combine this with communications with my friends and I've been unable to use the equipment sent to me. I've asked for assistance and hope to get this resolved but the information sent does not appear to be clear, the pieces don't seem to fit and the software doesn't appear to be easy to manage. I know I may have brain cancer, but I would like something that is a no-brainer so to speak and easy to assemble and use, and this certainly is not.I would hope my situation would be remedied, but I wouldn't recommend buying this online."
5,Great and affordable audio device,"Easy to configure, just plug and play and you are ready to record in high quality. The sound quality is really good, and I would say it is one of the best in its price range. The mic itself is robust and elegant, no plastic nonsense here. The different parameters on the mic makes for easy adjustments on the fly. Either you're a professional or an amateur, the C03U has something to offer for everyone. The briefcase and stand are also of solid materials, ideal for journeys and safe keepings."
4,Good Podcasting Mike,"I love the way you can just plug it into the USB port and you're ready to go. The sound is good, and all in all this is a good choice for the purpose. Whether you need the suitcase and desk stand depends on how you plan on using it. I just use it for a weekly show, and I found the table-top stand awkward to position easily in front of my computer screen, and still see the screen. Also I think they might have provided some clearer directions on how to set the whole thing up. I ended up using a floor stand to which I also clamp the pop filter, and since I leave it all set up from one show to the next, the suitcase isn't really useful to me. Just another thing to store."
2,Eh...,"Thankfully, the author calms down a bit for this comic. He takes his time, fleshing out details and developing interesting characters. Unlike Among the Damned, I actually understood what the hell was happening for the whole comic.Artwork is okay, but not as good as the previous comics. At least it's easy to follow.But as for the story, it's nothing great. I wouldn't call it bad, but it's nothing notably special. It sports an okay concept but it doesn't really feel... Silent Hillish at all.So far, these comics have been seriously breaking from the original source material. I don't understand why they felt the need to do that, but these stories absolutely don't work with the original games or the movie. I could live with that if these stories presented something worthwhile, but so far Dying Inside, Among the Damned, Paint it Black, and The Grinning Man haven't been much to write home about."
3,nice story.... ending a little predictable,"This one is a great addition to the silent hill series, although it turned out a little ""Hollywood-like"" at 3/4 of it... Ive read previous stories and this one falls a little short on finale suspense. Id recommend it to complete a collection but not for separate buys. If u want separated stories get any of the previous ones"
3,Purple shoes?,"I purchased the gnome as a gift for a friend of mine who is a big Gators fan. The gnome is cute, but I think blue shoes would look better on him compared to the bright purple ones."
4,Fragile!,"This style of gnome is actually one of the first styles that I saw people making. Now you get all kinds of people making them and they're much more sturdy. When we first bought this in 2008 and came back from Florida after wrapping it in all our clothes, it was shattered into mostly dust. I get that the luggage might have been tossed around but it shouldn't have done this much damage. If you're just looking for a Gator gnome, the newer ones are better quality. However I had to have this original one for our collection so when I ordered it from Amazon it came in great shape and went straight to a top shelf where nothing could harm it."
4,Gator gnome,Surprised that the shoes are a purplish color but otherwise cute gnome! Gave it as a gift and they loved it!
4,Cool Good Luck Charm,Gnome = awesome but WHY ARE THE SHOES PURPLE. That seems like a stupid oversight/intentional decision but other than that the Gnome is as described and definitely a good gift for any Gator fan (including yourself)!
2,disappointed,"some of the items where bent and items not what expected. It will work for no more than I will use it,otherwise it would need to be returned."
2,It has done the Job ....,"Got it for a good price and I was getting ready to build my i5 and needed new tools anyway .. Have to say cheap constructions wish I went for the ones w\ smaller number of accessories but better workmanship and better known company .. The ""ratchet"" if you want to call it that never seems to work; battery for the flash light died in the middle of my build after a Half hour (tops) of use .. But as I said does the job for now ."
3,Cheap Products Cheap Price,When I first opened this i was amazed at the quality and organization this product offered. Unfortunately with anything cheap you find out about the bad stuff pretty quick. The screwdriver broke the first time I used it and the bits strip easy so be careful. These tools are for low intensity jobs! Do not use the bits in a power drill! Also I have never been able to fit everything back in the way it came. The case really is weird but it works. I still haven't tried the soldering iron.
4,Wonderful smell!,"If you like fancy bars of soap, you will like this! This was a gift for my sister and she loves French milled soaps."
1,Misleading,"I really like the fragrance of patchouli. I'd purchased a bar of soap from Whole Foods that has a really good patchouli fragrance that stays on the skin all day. I thought this would be better because it's triple milled and would last longer than the bar I got from Whole Foods. However, they must have left the patchouli out of this batch. There's NO discernible fragrance AT ALL. Patchouli has a pretty strong odor so if there was any in here it should hit your nose the minute you walk in the bathroom (the other one does). I'd say this was falsely advertised. If it's any indication of their other soaps I wouldn't waste my money. In fact, I won't again. That's my last purchase from this company."
1,product not available,product was no longer available and there was no mention of this.so i was sent two of the same items. I then had to return the item. I was not happy.Cashmere Mist By Donna Karan For Women. Set-edt Spray 1.7 Ounces & Shampoo 2.5 Ounces & Conditioner 2.5 Ounces & Travel Bag
3,Mildly helpful for those with MPD,"In order to truly get something from the book, you have to be up on postmodernism. If you are someone with MPD, I suggest you search ""postmodernism"" at Wikipedia before deciding whether this book might be worth your time. I did read the book, and as my review title states, I found it to be only mildly helpful, but I found several interesting books in the Reference section for further reading.If you are, on the other hand, well-versed in postmodernism, and that is your main interest (rather than MPD), this might prove to be an interesting read."
1,confusing,I thought this book was very confusing. I have did (mpd) and got this book hoping to find a place for more information on this disorder. I was very dissapointed. The book focused not on mpd but on political issues and described more about postmodernism than it did about multiple personality disorder.
4,"Tough book to get through, but worth it","I found this book tough going, and it glossed over whole stretches of time in order, no doubt, to cover Catherine's life in less than a thousand pages. Overall, though, I enjoyed sections, and I'm interested to read more about this fascinating Queen."
3,Catherine de Medici Renaissance Queen of France,"I was very pleased with the over all condition of the outside of the book however, I was extremely displeased with the interior. On practically every page, the prior owner had used ink or a pink or yellow highlighter to underline practically every paragraph. This was so distracting that I ended up going to the book store and making another purchase."
4,Immensely readable,"A very sympathetic treatment of Catherine de Medici who has historically been regarded with some disdain. The author makes her subject much more three dimensional than just the royal assassin we have been accustomed to. I found it helpful to watch ""Queen Margot"" before reading this book; while the movie is not entirely faithful to Dumas' book, and Dumas' book is not always wholly accurate, having a visual image to reflect on helps keep the characters straight, especially when so many of them have the same name!"
2,"O..K., a bit shallow.","The book is a slow read at the beginning, where the author does not seem to have found much information about the young Catherine. Once her husband dies and - I assume - more was know about her, the book picks up. I got quite captivated and read the whole book. While interesting, it left me with a lot of questions about Catherine. I am searching for a book that is entertaining and goes deeper into the topic; the information gained from this book is a bit shallow and left me wanting."
2,long awated new english bio of a fascinating woman.,"this book brings a powerful and enigmatic woman back to life.However, I have read 2 other Catherine de Medicis Biographies and this one doesn't bring anything new to what it is already known. It is somewhat superficial and shallow like another reader mentioned before. I recomend Professor Knecht's book better, since it gives an analysis of catherine's personality based on her letters and on XVI century mentality. However, I hope the 600 page book by Ivan Cloulas gets published in English sometime soon, since it is the best Catherine de Medicis bio up to date."
5,Plugged it in and it worked,That's what it should do. I'm backing up right now to an eSata drive that I haven't used in a long time because I don't have the system anymore that had the eSata interface. I plugged this adapter in and it worked instantly in Windows 7.
1,Omission of MacOS,"I have an esata dual interface for my MacBook Pro but normally only need one port for porting around a single small drive. I thought this was going to be like the dual interface only smaller, and the Mac would just work with it anyway. The dual cardbus hadn't listed the MacOS either and worked fine. Now it's a gift for a PC relative."
2,The rhythm section promises a lot,"The line up promises a lot...wait, the rhythm section does :-)On Triangulo, by Michel Camilo, they did wonders, but there they had an apt partner.To my ears Fahir Atakoglu whilst swimming in slightly different waters musically than michel camilo -the comparison comes naturally in the context- he is just outplayed by his rhythm section and just not up to it.He lacks the subtleties and technique one has come to expect from michel camilo, or many other pianists.To me , the compositions are not strong enough to change this impression."
5,Thoroughly charming book - but one big flaw,"This book is clever, witty, and breezy, and I enjoyed it completely. The description of poor Harry and how he ends up on his low-carb diet, and all the changes it causes in his life is very funny, and the book moves along very quickly, so you pretty much laugh for a couple of hours, and then you are done. However, this book will make you hungry, and it is most unfair of the author to refer to PeanutBetter ButterBurst cookies and a terrific cauliflower salad and not provide recipes!"
2,"Very Mediocre, Meaningless Novel","I bought this book when I saw it at a store and thought it looked interesting as I was on a similar diet at the time.""Cooking for Harry"" was not terrible but for the most part the book was just plain meaningless and offered nothing of any interest or real importance.If you have a lot of time to read you might not mind it. If reading time is harder to come by for you look for something more substancial elsewhere."
4,good read,"I'm on low carbs so that could be why I enjoyed this little book.A fun read, didn't learn anything, but a cute story."
4,Extremely Light!!,"I have been doing some pretty heavy reading for my classes, and was looking for something to unwind with.. this is the perfect read..!! Its funny, light, extremely readable, and if you are a fast reader - engaging enough for you to finish in one go...!"
4,Flax seed oil,"We loved it for the price, cannot beat, the lignan component sinks to bottom and will not mix even with shaking, so if want to take advantage needs to cut open bottle and scrape it out; only reason we looked for it is because of previous use of other company's product."
3,gayer than I thought,"Actually it's not that good. The Bare Faced Cheeck album had a few good songs on it, so I thought that a best of must have too. Not so true after all."
3,Not what I expected,"When I bought this book I expected a biography-type book, like the story of the Z-Boys. That's not really what this is. It's just a collection of articles written about skateboarding during their time. It also has some interviews with Stacy Peralta, Tony Alva, and Jay, but the book is mostly about skateboarding during this time, not really about the Z-boys.It does have a really good amount of photos of them though. So, if you are a skateboarder, this would be a good book, but for a fan of the Z-Boys, this might just be a disapointment."

3,"Syd Barrett, RIP","I just finished watching this all too brief documentary on the late Syd Barrett. The first half was really good.. with a lot of footage I had never seen.. but I was disappointed in all the footage I've heard about that wasn't included. It focused mostly on his music and didn't touch his decline much, so stuff like ""Vegetable Man"" and ""Scream Thy Last Scream"" isn't mentioned. They spend more time on Madcap than Piper, but it is a very interesting and informative look at the man's musical legacy.. I was just looking for more on what happened to him.. and all the footage/interviews of him acting strange toward the end of his time with the band. It's glossed over pretty quickly. For the price, it could have been longer."
2,very disappointing,"if you are looking for interviews with syd, or live footage (other than an over-dubbed concert and some excerpts of ""videos"" for see emily play and arnold layne), then you had better give this one a miss.it consists chiefly of a handful of ""reviewers"" (how does one become ""qualified"" to be a ""reviewer"" anyway??) bloviating endlessly about all the stuff you ALREADY KNOW about syd.save your money, brothers and sisters."
1,dont buy it...,it doesn't come in manufacturing package. its come in clear cover with a small bar code on top.No Manufacture warranty.the top shell was loose.
3,pretty good,"This is a pretty good cross stitch book. The charts are black and white but are very clear and easy to follow. There are color photos of every finished piece. Lots of ideas for finishing pillows or picture frames -- rather than just framing the pieces. The charts are for the beginner to intermediate stitcher -- no half or quarter stitches, no advanced threadwork."
5,ASIA: AQUA,"I came into this album (And the other post Wetton CD's)after becoming frustrated with my other favorite band's refusal to record new music (i.e. KISS) I had begun exploring other bands I had listened to in the past. One of them being ASIA. I made the great choice of buying ""ASIA: GOLD"" which consist of their first 3 albums & other music! If you like ASIA you have to get it! Nuff said about that one.Anyway, enter John Payne (A Former member of ELO II) P.S. Bev Bevan doesn't hire just anybody.I found John Payne to be a refreshing influence on the band both musically & Lyrically. turning away from Wettons songs of pain & heart break to positive & uplifting pieces that revive the spirit & inspire the soul.If your a fan of the Old ASIA do not expect the same from this band,Be open minded about it & you just might find you will like it in spite of yourself."
1,Asia? In name only.,"Though the album may claim to be from ""Asia"", the resemblance is in name only. Yes, Geoff Downes is still plugging away on the keyboards, but he's the only original member of the group who performs on all the tracks. Former mates Carl Palmer and Steve Howe make brief appearances on the album (""courtesy"" of other record labels, no less), but their work is minimal, serving only to bridge the old with the new. That this is now Geoff's band is apparent from the first listen - heavy on keyboards, light on substance. New lead singer John Payne also fails to impress, offering little more than some hair-band shrieking to the already substandard material. The original Asia had a less-than-vaunted reputation with the critics to begin with; this album will give them no reason to change their opinions."
3,John Payne is no John Wetton,"""Aqua"" is the first Asia album to feature John Payne on lead vocals. Quite honestly, I stopped following the group as closely after John Wetton left. This album still has Geoff Downes, Carl Palmer, and Steve Howe, but it falls short of the previous releases. Yes, the signature keyboards and drums are there, but Payne simply cannot match Wetton's voice and bass. Some of the songs, such as ""Love Under Fire"" and ""Lay Down Your Arms"" are ok, but they don't come close to Wetton's songs from earlier albums. ""Asrta, ""Alpha"", and ""Asia"" are much better than this one."
4,Good work,"Yes, this is the right word 4 it.It's not bad, not great, just good.May B if the band wouldn't have put Arena out it would B great.The best tracks R Who Will Stop The Rain, Lay Down Your Arms, Don't Call Me, Heaven On Earth and the 2 instrumentals R also very fine. Try 2 get the extra tracks version, where Obsession is added as a bonus track (beside Little Rich Boy), that is simply the best track on Aqua.It's not as professional and progressive as Arena, but still a good choice 4 all rock fans, who like melodic rock music combined with some hard rock elements.Easy listenable, enjoyable album, but not their best."
1,are you dehydrated?,"The title of this record is appropriate. ""Aqua"" contains some of the most watered-down music ever recorded."
3,Asia goes pop-metal,"""Aqua"" is the first Asia album without John Wetton and the ""darkness"" of the Wetton-era albums is readily missing. Geoff Downes's keyboards are the major force of this album and give the album an ""aquatic"" feel as the arrangements are lush and full. John Payne's voice is much more operatic than Wetton's, and he's not afraid to throw in the heavy metal wail when necessary. Definitely a different sound than the Wetton-era band. Highlights include ""Who Will Stop the Rain"" and ""Heaven on Earth"". I personally like ""Don't Call Me"", but the song seems a bit unfinished as do some of the other songs. I believe more production would have done this album a world of good."
2,Not very good,"I give this Asia album 2 stars because of the groups usual high quality musicianship. Outside of that, the lyrics are forgetable and John Paynes lyrics aren't close to the caliber of the music."
2,Payne era begins.,"""Aqua"" (1992) Did not chart.John Payne's version of Asia began with, Carl Palmer on drums, Geoff Downes keyboards, Steve Howe guitar on 6 tracks, and Al Pitrelli (current member of Trans-Siberian Orchestra). ""Who Will Stop The Rain?"", got plenty of airplay here in '92. Other tunes of note, ""Love Under Fire"" written by Greg Lake and ""Crime Of The Heart"". This album sounds like a hair band and that's a shame. This would be the last album I would buy until their 2006 live album by the original group."
4,Grade B+,"Jeff Payne's first cd as vocalist and bassist, may also be the new lineup's best. It's close between this cd and their next one, ARIA. The group, even though they changed singers, still keep much of their signature sound, and Payne, who is not a carbon copy of old singer Wetton, still has the Asia delivery to his songs, of course it helps that rest of Asia is still intact. After this cd only Downes will be an orginal member. WHO CAN STOP THE RAIN, VOICE OF REASON, & DON'T CALL ME, are the closest to the orginal Asia, and are the best songs on the cd. LITTLE RICH BOY, is my least liked song on this cd. Group doesn't stray far from the old grounds, even with a new singer. Not a bad release from the reformed Asia."
3,Re-living old old days,Delightful book written in inimitable style. Superb story telling. Like westerns. You need not worry about story line. Just relax and enjoy the narration
5,wild wacky weird....FUNNY with a CAPITAL P.H.,"if you like Tom Lehrer or Monty Python Songs, this one is up your alley... love, sex, politics, and religion...all in the key of G. this is the most demented stuff i've heard since the first Spinal Tap record.... SICK SICK SICK but definitely FUNNY!!!"
5,Musical Comedy at its Best (and Sickest!),"If you find yourself easily offended, I wouldn't recommend this CD to you.However, if you find yourself amused, entertained, or aroused by sick food humor, bodily dis-functions, demented love analogies, and that big purple dinosaur biting the dust, then &quot;Kill Barney and Other Delights&quot; is the album for you!PH Fred exhibits some of the finest tidbits of intelligent musical comedy you'll get your hands on! He pokes fun at some of the biggest controversies, lesbians, and children's programs of 1998. PH Fred teaches us about the finer points of love. I truly felt smarter after listening to this album! You will be doing yourself a big favor by buying this CD. There is definitely more to this record than meets the eye (that is more than a man in a tutu!). You are sure to be delighted by &quot;Kill Barney and Other Delights&quot;."
2,This classic is forgettable,"Even though the selections on this cd seemed to be from stellar orchestras and conductors, I was underwhelmed with each piece. A lack of vibrancy and resonance resulted in a very boring listening experience."
3,Pocket-sized sportscar book,"An A-Z pocket-size reference book comprehensively covering the world of sportscars, from vintage to the date of publication (1963); each entry gives a brief history, followed by technical/performance details; illustrated on every page w/ b&w photos of sportscars. ."
2,Disappointing--I Thought Words Was Better Than This!,"Having heard Punch and Words cypher on Lyrist Lounge I and Words collaborate with Tip on the second volume, I thought this album would be bangin'. Instead, they take the easy road and rhyme about the same stuff everyone else does--and with little creativity. I've got mad ho's, I've got mad money, so forth, and so on. That stuff is tired, and something I wouldn't expect from an MC as talented and versatile as Words. And what's worse is the beats aren't really that tight, so you can't really get into it musically. Too bad."
3,WORD!!!!!,"Words and Punch finally come out with a tight EP to showcase their skills. I would give a better score but these two have to be the worst collaboration in hip-hop; completely different styles. Wordsworth, being the shining point, spits intellectual lyrics on tracks like Mistress and I-95, out-shining Punchline every time. The beats are decent, nothing spectacular. But anyone saying this EP is wack - is sleeping. Definitely buy this if you enjoy true underground hip-hop."
1,A HORRIFIC ALBUM,after hearing these cats on the lyricist lounge album and various other joints i thought they were an up and coming duo.But then MTV got a hold of them.Apparently the Lyricist Lounge show although short-lived was enough to poison these unfortunate artists.'The EP'paints these guys as some kind of wannabe neo-thugs which is not why i enjoyed their earlier work.The beats are incredibly ordinary and that I-95 joint is one of the most tragic horrendous attempts at music i have ever encountered. Nuff said.
1,"Cmon Wordsworth, you could do better than this.","First of all get rid of Punch and get yourself a producer. I would of gave this album a Zero if I could. I love underground but this is just wack. Wordsworth is sick, no doubt but better luck next time."
5,Beautiful colors,These colors are absolute stunning! The pigments are great and they show up very nicely. I have palettes 2 & 3 and will be purchasing the 1st one as well. You can't go wrong with these.
4,"Like Neurosis, you're gonna have to let it grow on you","It was difficult finding this CD on Amazon.com First off his name is spelled wrong, it's supposed to be Steve Von Til. His two solo CDs are listed under different names... Good luck finding Scott Kelly's solo effort as well.Anyhow, if you've picked up ""A Sun That Never Sets"", ""Soveriegn"" or just happened to grab the new Mp3 from the upcoming CD at www.neurosis.com ... You'll notice Steve has been crooning more than usual. See: ""Stones From The Sky"" off of ""ASTNS"". His solo work is stripped down, folky, bare, spacious and looming. Von Til's vocals evoke a robustness akin to a heavily sedated Jim Morrision. Admittedly, Steve's words are delivered with considerably more flair, and an increasigly lush backing breaks away from the monotony of his first solo release.I would recommend this to fans of The Tea Party, Jerry Cantrell(in his more somber moments) and of course those open-minded enough to adore Neurosis."
4,Pretty Good Best Of,"Britny Fox were a hair band that had it all: an excellent guitarist, raspy voiced singer, and a hit song in Girlschool. This collection only spans their first two album with orignal singer, ""Dizzy"" Dean Davidson. Their first album is considered a hair metal classic. The songs ""Girlschool"", ""Long Way To Love"", and ""Save The Weak"" all rock hard. This collection also include their two cover songs ""Gudbye T'Jane"" by Slade, and ""Hair of the Dog"" by Nazareth, both of which are excellent. This disc is also enhanced so if you pop it into you computer you can see a live video of ""Long Way To Love"" and the music video for ""Girlschool"". Not bad for $10."
4,Britney Fox - 'The Best Of .....' (Sony),"I don't care WHAT anyone says, Britny Fox IS in fact like a Cinderella wanna be. That's isn't necessarily a bad thing, for I saw the band twice back in the day and always wanted to check them out again. This 'Best Of' compilation looks to be pulled from their first two albums, that were good '80's metal. Tunes I liked the best were ""Girlschool"" (love the old Mtv video), ""Long Way To Love"" (reminds me SO much of Aerosmith), ""In Motion"", a cover of Slade's ""Gudbye T' Jane"" and ""Standing In The Shadows"". A couple of live tunes were tagged on to lure both old and new fans, I'm sure. A should-have."
5,Not Bad,Being as old as I am I forgot about this band years ago....caught School Girls on the radio and it reminded me of high school....not a bad buy for under 10 bucks!
2,2.25 stars- Just another hair-band,"Basically, Britny Fox is a one or two hit wonder. I bought their first self-titled album because I absolutely loved the song ""Long Way to Love"". The song ""Girls School"" was okay, but past those two tracks, they just didn't have game. I've never heard their second album but listened to all the 30 second samples (from the greatest hits cd) here on Amazon, and, basically those two songs I mentioned before are apparently the best that they have to offer. Either get the first album or the greatest hits to get ""Long Way to Love"". That's all you need from this mediocre hair-band. If you really want to listen to a good hair-band listen to the first three from the group EUROPE or anything from KINGDOM COME."
2,Cinderella ...,"Can you imagine anyone making money by being a Cinderella ... band? Well Britney Fox did it! They play, look, and perform just like Cinderella. If you had never heard either band and you listened to a tape of alternating songs, you WOULDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. Besides I think they had the same taylors."
4,AC/DC Influenced Hard Rock!,"Brity Fox was one of the many unsung hair metal bands from the late 1980's. They had everything that their more successfull contemporaries had, it's just that they came at the wrong time, they not 'commercial' enough for the mainstream audience, or something smelling lke that. Britny Fox had talent, they had leather and lipstick, but they never really hit it big. This is a fantastic collection, though. Britny Fox was a very AC/DC influenced band, as they showcased on such songs as 'Long Way To Love, 'Girlschool', and 'Standing In The Shadows. Although I could do without the singer's voice, this collection stands as proof that just because a band never hit it big doesn't mean they are not talented. Some of the best songs are the aforementioned 3, the Slade cover Gudbuy T'Jane, and Dream On(not the Aerosmith song of the same name)."
2,Good Compilation from a Two Trick Pony,"The few people who still care about Britny Fox probably remember them as that band with the guys who weren't good enough to play in Cinderella, used frilly shirts and had a video on MTV with catholic school girls. That's kind of a shame, really, because much like Cinderella, they had a knack for putting out great AC/DC inspired hair metal party anthems every now and then, albeit they lacked the former's rootsy blues touch, gift for melody and songwriting talent. Although in my oppinion Britny Fox only released two really whorthwile songs during their less than illustrious career, Girlschool and Long Way to Love, the rest of the material presented on this disk is OK. If 80's hard rock's your cup of tea, you might like this, but be forewarned that even in their heyday, this was a mediocre, third tier hair metal band at best."
2,more than I expected..or needed,"This thing could launch a rocket! quite heavy and long and just way powerful. I've used it a few times - find myself reluctant to pull it out bcz it's just so unweildy. Must admit it sure does a job on blending soup! It's so powerful, tho, that while it's on, the blade gets suctioned on the bottom of the pan. I ONCE tried to pull it up while it was running and it flew off whirling carrot soup all over the kitchen. considering I only use this kind of thing 6 or 8 times a year, if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't shop for power and wattage - I'd go for something more manageable and less likely to be found in a NASA lab."
2,not that great,"This immersion blender is powerful, but has some flaws. First, you have to depress the button constantly for the blender to work, this can be akward and tedious when you're blending an entire pot of soup. This is pretty much what I hate the most about this. Second, the mini food processor is pretty shoddy. The first one that came with my blender was cracked, the company I bought it from had awesome customer service and sent me a new one right away withoug my needing to return the first one. After 2 uses (making salad dressing, nothing too complicated) the second one has cracks in the bottom where oil leaks out. I had an old Braun one that worked well for 10 years. . .I wish I could have found that one."
1,Really Wanted to Love This,"I bought this after careful research because I needed something really powerful that would last and do the simple jobs well. It's a great little appliance until (very quickly) it starts to fall apart. The plastic housing just doesn't stand up to basic use. The clips that hold the motor/wand to the attachments broke off almost immediately and now I have to hold the attachments to the wand while using it. The gasket in the blender head came loose, and that can't be used because the plate behind the blade wobbles all around, the blended food gets behind it and into the mechanism, and it sprays food all around the kitchen. The motor is a joy, just the power I wanted, but no good at all if the rest of the appliance falls apart. I'm going back to my local discount store and buying a crummy one that holds up lots better and is cheap to replace if it doesn't."

3,Low quality but for the price!!!,"You can not expect high quality for this price, let you wrist black when weather is hot"
5,"Presidential Facts; Topical Lists, Comparisons and Statistics","The author delivered exactly what was promised; comparative lists in an easy to reference format of fun and interesting presidential facts. I obtained this book as a coffee table book, thinking that it would be fun and educational for guests and my kids. Not only has it achieved its purpose (both kids have read it without any prompting), it serves as a fun conversational stimulant. Most importantly, one of my 14 year old's friends found it so helpful she asked to borrow it as a reference for a 9th grade paper she was writing! Thank you!"
2,Burned out to fast,The bulb was fine but it burned out after only a few days. Not going to buy it again.
5,Funnel Holder,This is an awesome product! Wish more automotive items were this simple but effective. Great idea so your funnel doesnt lie around getting dirty or leaking all over shelves.
3,"Read it once, don't need to read it again","I felt that, after reading reviews, etc., that this novel would tell the tale of Katherine, and sometimes it does, but often it does not. To me the story is told not from Katherine's perspective but of others about her. Often, it seemed that Katherine was an afterthought.It was a good book, but the focus seemed..out of focus."
3,Very Complicated to Put together,This took hours to put all together and my 10-year old son who is smarter then an average 10 year old could do it but not on his own and not without some frustration. He played with it the day he put it together but not again since then. It wasn't as big of a hit as I had hoped.
5,Excellent,"I read this book in fifth grade, read it again and watched the movie in sixth grade. I'm in seventh now, and I'm still loving it. It sends a very real message about the horrors of the holocaust. Not meant for younger kids, (does that include me! ) but an excellent movie.p.s. It's ((........))"
5,Every teenager should have to see this...,I saw this movie on Showtime many years ago and didnt recall the title...so i finally took the time to search for it by content - a teenager relives the Holocaust...very touching movie that explains tradition...every teenager (and some adults) should have to watch this.
3,The Devil's Arithmetic movie,"My students read this book in class and were truly affected by the content matter. I realize that books and movies always differ, but there were many, many differences with this movie. The movie does show some of the degrading circumstances of the concentration camps, but the differences (from the book) made the movie confusing at times. I will still show the movie each year after reading the book, but I will caution that it is very different from our reading...and not as good."
5,devils arithmatic,"This movie is an excellent teaching tool for todays young generation.The Holocaust is an Historical fact, despite those who would seek to deny its horror...this new breed of Anti Semitics who in reality are just the old breed reincarnated.Generations to come need to know the truth and Dustin Hoffman has done an excellent job directing this movie and displaying the truth in a chilling yet very watchable way...Bravo."
4,Accompaniment to Anne Frank,"My teaching colleague and I showed this to eighth graders as an accompaniment to an Anne Frank unit. The students were clearly moved by it. We have now made this a standard part of our curriculum. We feel it encourages students to seek further information about the Holocaust, meeting the goal of any teaching opportunity. While it touches on the horrors our fellow human beings faced, it still respects the sensitive nature of some our less mature students. I highly endorse this movie."
1,Think before you write,"Why can't people understand that movies are almost NEVER as good as the book. A great example is Lords of the Rings. Three movies but they still did'nt make it as good as the book and had to leave alot of important parts out. Why can't people enjoy the movie for what it is. This also might be the only time some people will watch a movie like this, but then change thier minds because of this kind of reviews ."
3,Anonymous,"Sorry, unable to reiew this movie as it was bought as a gift and remailed to recipient when I received it."
1,The Absolute Worst Movie I Ever Saw,This is a horrible tale about a girl named Hannah. The movie sucked so badly i fell asleep.
5,An awe inspiring performance,"I absolutely thought this movie got the point across about the Holocaust. It was so terrible watching some of the torture that Jews went through, but the ending was definitely worth the emotional rollercoaster."
1,Terrible,"We did a novel study on this book in our reading class, and our teacher got this movie for us to watch. What a disappointment! It is nothing like the book. Hannah is about 7 years older than she is in the book, they never even mention the Hannah/Chaya connection, and almost all of the main characters aren't even mentioned or have the major roles that they have in the book. If you are looking for a good movie adaptation of a good book, don't even bother with this movie. However, if you've never read the book and are looking for an interesting (if fictional) story on the Holocaust, this would be a good bet."
3,Read the book,I was disappointed that the movie was so far removed from the plot line of the book. The book was excellent.
1,Pop history,"As a Polish scholar with interest in 2. WW and Holocaust I can only say - pop history. I hate, when filmmakers don't tell the whole truth or manipulate it. This movie is full of mistakes - right from beginning. October 1941 - surprise, surprise - Germans interrupt a wedding! But in the Fall 1941 Jews have been treated as animals in 2 years already and at least in a year they lived in ghettos. Deportation - discussion with Germans? Absurd! No selection before departure and after arrival? No way. KZ prizoners look quite healthy and fed up. And where are all this people stuffed together in KZ camps? No money for actors?A romantic story with a tiny relation to the hell of Shoa.If you want to see a movie closer to reality of Jews destiny see Spielbergs Schindlers List, see Polanskis The Pianist."
5,Very enjoyable!,I find the movie to follow the book very well. I think that Kirsten Dunstdoes an excellent job. It shows the life of a young high school girlwho definitely wants to have nothing to to do with her faith untila unusal fate of God happens to her on one of her religious holidays.It is a must see movie and I would recommend it to any of my friends.
4,The Devil's Arithmetic,"The film, ""The Devil's Arithmetic"" is very moving. The details were uncanny and the actress did a very good job. I enjoyed it very much and hope that others will be able to see how moving it was."
