4,An exploration of the world and a mind...,"I really enjoyed this book, as I thought that it was a frank depiction of one woman's journey to a strange and curious world. I found Zeppa's ability to tell her experience as a story very unique and it really drew me in and made me feel like I was experiencing first hand her emotions and thoughts. I loved the first half in particular, because the picture of the village and especially Zeppa's relationship with the students was really vivid and touching. The second half was a little bit more jumbled in terms of what she was getting across, but overall, it was such a fresh breath of light on a country that I knew little about and reminded me of how incredible and enriching it is to experience and understand other cultures. Definitely recommended, especially for those with a sense of adventure and an appetite for travel."
4,So strange...,I don't know how I came across this album but I am glad I did! This is an album that I don't even know how to describe other than saying its possibly the strangest thing I've ever heard. There's nothing like this and the fact it was recorded over 30 years ago is extraordinaire. This is obviously some sort of concept album but what does it all mean?Buy this album if you're looking for something genuinely disturbing and left of center.
3,"A good overview, but not a great review","I think this makes for a fine overview of the material, but it doesn't seem to do any substantial review. There are better study guides out there."
3,"Okay, but not perfect",Had to take Neurobiology for occupational therapy grad school. This was not the best textbook in the world. I found much better info on websites. I would NOT recommend purchasing the supplemental material/study guide. The color plates are also supplemental and helped me a little more than the text.
4,The power of scent,"Book is a great reference of scents. It begins with the use of scent and how inhaling certain herbs and essential oils can effect our moods and outcomes in life. It has different methods and techniques to gain specific results with aromatherapy. Includes recommended aromas for days of the week, seasons, lunar cycles, elements, planets, and zodiac. It also contains a list of oil and plant distributers for your harder to find items. Also includes a pretty big reference guide of the aromas and their uses. Very handy to have around. I know I will be referring to it time and again."
5,great book on aromatherapy,"this book tells about different scents,how to use them for magick,and what ones are dangerous and should not be used. i highly reccomend this book"
5,Aromatherapy,I am a massage therapist and the recipies in the book are great. I use them daily to create a very relaxing atmosphere for my clients.
1,big disapoinment,I was so excited when I bought this book - expecting new information about essential oils - but there's no new information in this book. And it's not kindle friendly.
2,Not enough information to fully understand aromatherapy,This book did not explain enough about aromatherapy for me to understand the the full extent of how to mix diffrent essential oils. It is a good and helpful book but it wasn't enough for me.
3,JUST DIDN'T CUT IT!!!!,"I have read all the series in order, this being number nine. I really liked the first ones much better. Silent Justice really has two stories at the same time. Ben has a class action suit against a big company for dumping chemicals into drinking water and therefore killing children. Meanwhile, his friend, Mike Morell is after a person who is killing people for no apparent reason. What is the killer looking for? What is the merchandise? I nearly went to sleep reading page after page of much to complicated words for my small brain understand during the trial. I really like Ben, Christina McCall, Jones, Loving and Mike. Maybe its time for me to change instead of thinking Bernhardt will go back to writing like he did earlier. It is sort of a surprise ending but I thought I would read forever to get to that part. Sorry, but the writer has done better."
3,well poisoned,"the continuing travails of boy-scoutish ben kincaid and his perky, platonic paramour, christina.difficulty in proving causation link to a specific source in a class action lawsuit is well illustrated. serial killer subplot only adds gratuitous gore."
5,GUS Thought He Saw A WoodChuck ! ! ! ! !,"It is about time!!! My VHS copies of these specials are about to wear out. Every single one is smart, funny, and full of the most obscure references you will ever find. With DVDs of most of all the SNL Alum being released all the time, it was about time we Dennis Miller fans get some love too. Can a Special Edition Director's Cut of BORDELLO OF BLOOD be too far behind???"
4,It's Miller Time,"Dennis Miller is an entirely different comedian from what I was used to when I began watching his HBO series on a regular basis. I loved his intelligent rants. I absolutely loved his material and his series.Having the series and the specials on home video was always a goal of mine. I never recorded any of it on VHS, so thankfully someone at HBO used his head and released these on DVD. They did a good job with it.Now, if only they could bring the series to DVD. ;) I know his topical humor doesn't resonate quite so much today, but things haven't changed THAT much in the world since Miller went off air."
3,The Middle Sags,"I love Dennis Miller as is or has become. Sort of an X-generation Mort Sahl with the O.E.D. and Rimbaud memorized. The first concert was great, then it became rather tedious, like Mr. Cool showed up, so applause and chortle. The final concert was back on track. It really seemed, politics apart, that it is a question of intellect and imagination in the service of belief as opposed to self-congratulation."
1,snoddrop,"Dennis MIller is a cop out. I use to listen to him in the late 90's and enjoyed his rants. Now he has succumbed to the ignorant right and his dialogues are the same stuff you hear on Rush and Glen's show. Sorry Dennis...but your canned Obama slams suck, and so do you."
1,WORTHLESS MOVIE,"The quality of the CD was fine and delivery was quick, but this movie is worthless. I didn't buy it because of Dwight Yoakum, but because Walton Goggins was in it. Bad, bad acting by everyone. It looks like one of Walton's first."
5,"Great peak into Smile, and Wild Honey is a great R&B album",I always knew the old Beach Boy classics but recently got into Pet Sounds. I wanted to hear what could have been of the Smile album so I got this CD. The smile stuff is good but the big surprise to me is Wild Honey. It's a great R&B album. Unlike the other Beach Boy albums. I really enjoy listening to it.
5,Great Flashback to Babyhood,"I was 3 years old when this album was released,and heard it over and over being played by my much older siblings. When they were all moved out, I found the record and, at age 7 or 8, had a fantastic time rediscovering and remembering these strange, entertaining, beautiful songs all over again. I still have the LP, though it's pretty much 'unlistenable' by now, and am really happy to see it remastered on Amazon. Personal favorites were always 'Vegetables', 'Heroes and Villains' and 'Fall Breaks and Back to Winter' ( besides, obviously, 'Good Vibrations'.) They had an address for a fan club on the jacket- wonder if they ever received my dopey letter. What great memories- thank you, Brian Wilson and Amazon!"
3,Smiley Smile 2 stars - Wld Honey 4 stars,"Smiley Smile simply is the moment when the Beach Boys died. It maybe impossible to imagine now, but up to 1966 the Beach Boys were as respected as artists as the Beatles. Smiley Smile is a rushed album, with practically no instrumentation whatsoever and many under-rehearsed vocals, except for Good Vibrations and Heroes and Villians. If Capitol ever releases a Smile box set as they promised, Smiley Smile will be then send to oblivion, in the hall of shame where it belongs. The world never took the beach boys seriously after that. Wild Honey is actually a very good album, not better than Pet Sounds or Smile, but different than anything they ever did before. Some of the songs and arrangements are totally Brian Wilson at his best. Some of the 'soul' vocals I find difficult to digest and I miss the Beach boys blend on the songs. The extra tracks on the album are ESSENTIAL to any serious beach boys fan, so, if you are, you need this album."
2,Pretty dire followups to Pet Sounds,"Beach Boys fanatics will be fanatics about this but this is a pairing of a couple of extremely weak albums with ""only"" a couple of truly great songs on it (Heroes and Villains and Good something-or-other). Smiley Smile is a stoned-sounding mess, many of the songs are incoherently awful and even the tuneful ones have seriously dumb lyrics (""I love my vegetables"") or aural noise experiments (laughing, speeding-up, etc.) that make them painful as background music. Wild Honey is more coherent but the fire that was Pet Sounds simply sounds damp now. For fans who have to have everything only."
3,good extra tracks,"Right now the SMILE fanatics are going nuts, and rightly so. A finished live version has been witnessed, recorded and lavishly praised. The CD of rock's holy grail is due to hit the stores this fall. This time they can print up the liner notes with a little more confidence, hopefully.What a curio Smiley Smile will be compared to the original vision. A little sad and silly, but with some definite personality. Wild Honey is desperate and professional, with a little attitude. But the double album pales to the one genuine classic single that is included, as well as the ""alternate"" version of Heroes and Villains that confidantly shows off what the Smile album was supposed to sound like. The other extras are classic single variations, followed by a very live family croon, and ending with a lost gem.A couple of really nice items amongst two weak albums."
3,Works well but poor design,"It works well but its pretty hard to get it into my ear, and it falls out easily."
3,Help for Composers,"if you are a student studying composition, then this book is a must. The book is too technical to interest the general music lover."
1,EXTREMELY ANNOYING,"Might very well be the most annoying game ever played. The game proceeds at a glacial pace, due to an extremely long-winded, repetitive and obnoxious ""host"". Absolutely insufferable.The questions are decent for the targeted grade levels, though some children at that age still have trouble losing windows when their opponents answer a question correctly.It could be a good game, but that ""host"" make you want to run screaming from the room. :( Trust me, I normally don't irritate that easily. But if you have the patience of a saint, go for it."
5,Five Star Review for Pregnancy= 40 Weeks of Preparation,This is a great book! It is a great resource for pregnant women. It also was a great resource for every trial and tribulation in my life. I refer to this book often for guidance. I highly recommend it to everyone!
5,"great devotional material, one which challenged me enter the full-time ministry!","As Christians, at the point of our conversion, are called not only to Sonship with God, but also to a life of discipleship and close communion with Him. In this book, the author brings us through 14 familiar passages of the Bible that relates to many aspects of our Christian lives, of the meaning, path, costs and finally reward of discipleship. The points raised by the author are highly relevant to the life of a Christian in our current day and age. It is recommended to have these portions of scripture well-understood and deeply imbedded in our. The books never ceases to challenge us to lead a life more pleasing and acceptable in the sight of the Lord. May you also be challenged to pick up this book, and also to take up your cross and follow Him!"
5,Da Bomb Diggity,"Judging from the fact that this book was written in the 60's I was certain that it couldn't speak to me, that is until I finally put aside my complaints and picked up Boice's work. It rocks the hizzouse and teaches all the phat things you need to know about the basic Christian life.Be prepared to get serious and get rocked-because if you take any of his words to heart (solidly based off of Jesus' teachings) your life should become radically different.Peace"
5,GOOD BOOK!,"We are going through this book for my discipleship group as a conversation launching point (It has taken over 12 months to go through it) we have had great conversations based on the chapters as well as helping each other grow in sanctification! ""We read books to change, we don't read books to just read books."""
3,Decent book but hard to use,"This book should have been spiral bound. It really pisses me off the author didn't consider that the pages need to lay flat for dowsing. The kindle edition is useless because there are no hotlinks to switch pages and its paginated wrong so the title shows up for the next or previous page, and is even worse on the Kindle DX."
4,Pendulum Healing Hand Book,"Walter Luebeck's book is for the more advaced pendulum user, lots of hypnotic charts and as most books of this kind ,Walter tells you how to make a pendulum and charts for a person to experiment with. well written by a auther who knows his business."
2,Pendulum Healing Handook,It's OK. I still prefer Dale Olson's The Pendulum Charts to anything elseI've ever read or seen. Some of the charts in this book are different andinteresting.
5,Knowledge from the gods,"The six members of Killarmy--Islord, Beretta, Shogun Assason, Killa Sin, 9th Prince and Dom pachino--bring knowledge rhymes on thirteen tracks. Without the aide of guest spots, Killarmy delivers lyrical diversity through it's numerous MC's. Executive producer the RZA lets 4th Disciple, Allah Mathematics and Russ Prez created the head-nodding beats such as ""5 Stages of Consciousness,"" ""Murder Venue"" and ""The Shoot Out."" More than an off-shoot of the Wu-Tang Clan, Killarmy unleashes its own version of lyrical fury & intelligence with the tracks ""Last Poet,"" ""Serving Justice"" and ""Galactics."" . Fav track ""Allah Sees Everything"".don't sleep on any one of the six MCs god. Peace god!"
3,Great Girl Flick!,"You can most always rate any movie with Richard Chamberlain in it with an ""A"" in my opinion. There's no heavy involved plot here and you'll pretty much know which way the story is headed. STILL....No blood, no guts, no drug busts or super heros....just a nice clean movie that gives you that warm fuzzy feeling at the end."
4,A Moving Love Story,"All the Winters That Have BeenA great love story with Richard Chamberlain, Karen Allen an Hal Holbrook giving believable and moving performances. It has drama and romance.Chamberlain, after betrayal 20 years earlier of his love, Karen Allen and her Eskimo family, comes back to the region to see his dying uncle. At first, Karen does not want to see him, but later, they get back together. But, what Chamberlain does not know, and what has never been told to him, is that he has a son who is grown up and had been raised by Karen and her husband, who later had died. This is where the drama comes. Does Karen tell Chamberalin about the son, which may upset the son who loved his adopted father, or not?A great sentimental love story."
3,all of these cats are wrong..,"comming from a veteran god forbid fan who owns everything theyve released this is by far their worst album, but thats not saying this album is bad. you have to be a very huge fan of GF to appreciate where they started at. some people are ignorant and give it a 1, others are even more ignorant and give it a 5...but i give it a three because most people will not like it but for those diehards out there this album is pure gold."
1,God Forbid They let out another album that sucks this much,Terrible sound quality. Incoherent vocals along with an almost total absence of harmony leads make this album a big load of crap. I gave it one star because I think that they deserve at least that for their effort.Don't get me wrong I like God forbid but if you would like to purchase one of their albums please either get Get Determination or Gone Forever because this album will leave you wondering how could their debut album suck so much .
2,suspicious backcover,"I did not read the book, I stopped when reading a statement in the back cover: ""we only utilise on average two per cent of our potential brainpower"".That is an urban myth, there is no scientific evidence that supports it. I lost complete confidence in the book and have not picked it up since. If you found the book useful please write a review."
4,Thoroughly enjoyed!,"I did not see Poldark when it came out but had heard about it, of course. I was not disappointed, except in the ending which seemed to have been crammed into one episode as if the script writers heard the day before they had to wrap it up. Too much was left unresolved. However, overall it was fun. I loved seeing a very young Kevin McNally. Recommended!"
3,No subtitles?,Are the British doing it to us again? Putting out a great series--one replete with dialect--and putting it out without subtitles?
5,good show!,I watched Poldark on Masterpiece theatre back in the early 80's - I've longed to have it come out in vcr or dve - thanks for making it available! It is everything I remember and more - excellent! When is season three coming out?? I can hardly wait!
5,Poldark complete series DVD,I couldn't get the 1980 VHS copies of copies from the original PBS series in the trash fast enough! From time of purchase to my doorstep was 4 days. Bought a set for my sister too! Poldark is a long standing PBS passion for 37 years now. I'm so happy with my DVD quality and at a great price too!
5,"THIS IS ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, THE BEST OF THE BEST","WOW! THIS CD WILL BLOW YOU AWAY. I HAD NEVER LISTENED TO ANY OF JAGUARES MUSIC, UNTIL I GOT THIS CD- THREE YEARS AGO... I FELL IN LOVE IN AN INSTANT. THE MUSIC AND THE LYRICS ARE SO POWERFUL, SAUL'S VOICE IS REALLY SOMETHING ELSE. I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYONE SING LIKE HE DOES. THAT IS ABSOLUTE TALENT.AS FOR HIS ABILITY TO WRITE SONGS, I THINK HE TOTALLY OUT DOES HIMSELF. THE TOPICS ARE MYSTICAL AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT REALITY & CAN EVEN MAKE YOU CRY! THE MUSIC JUST MAKES YOU WANNA BANG OUR HEAD & JUST BUST OUT HOPPING AND DANCING WHERE EVER YOU ARE AT.I HAVE 5 CD'S IN MY CD CHANGER & GUESS WHAT ALL FIVE ARE? EL EQUILIBRIO DE LOS JAGUARES......"
4,Jaguares can eat Mana and others up.,"Well listening to the Jaguares is such a treat. From the ballad ""Imaginame"" to ""Dejate Ver"" and especially the catcy, ""Detras de los cerros,"" one can not help but fall in love with this album. i haven't heard a whole album by caifanes but if it's like this than i must buy their cds too. overall an excellent cd and good buy."
4,Un Jaguar resurge,"Primer album de Jaguares. Saul Hernandez es acompañado en este disco por Jose Manuel Aguilera (Sangre Azteca), Federico Fong (Kenny y los Electricos) y Alfonso Andre (Caifanes), musicos de LA BARRANCA.Las canciones hablan de cierta depresion por parte de Hernandez, es un disco muy oscuro, prueba de ello son canciones como ""Voy a Volar"" y ""Huracan"".La aportacion de Aguilera en ""Clavame Mejor los Dientes"" y ""Solo Somos Sueños"" es algo excelente.Canciones recomendadas: Detras de los cerros, Nunca te doblaras, Clavame Mejor los dientes, Adonde Vamos A Ir."
4,Folk music with a Newfoundland twist.,This album is worth the price just for Catch the Wind... a superb Donovan cover which takes the song to new heights - I want it played at my funeral! Beautiful guitar playing too. They played for the Queen in the Albert Hall once. They deserve a wider audience.
5,"Sinbad, First Kid",I enjoy bubble gum videos requiring little thinking and good humor/laughs. This is a perfect fit. I would recommond this video for a good night of family viewing.
4,Sinbad is sinfully good in great Disney flick!,"I am sure we were all dubious when we learned that the comic stylings of Sinbad were to be put on parade in what seemed like a formulaic Disney live action film. This has never been Disney's strong suit, as such films as 'No Deposit No Return' testify to. However, First Kid turned out to be a delightful romp through the lives of America's first family.This is a great movie for families, and in a world where violence and strong languange seem 'flagrante vous etu fei', isn't this enough to warrant purchasing this awesome film? The answer, surprisingly, is perhaps. I give it five stars, despite the obvious four stars I gave it before I wrote this.Thank you and God Bless America."
5,Good Movie! Brock is awsome!,"This movie stars a hott kid, Brock Pierce, Hes a really good young actor! It also has Sinbad and Zachary Ty Bryan from Home Improvement. It's basically about the First Kid (The president's son) trying to fit in at his new public school, it's really good!!!"
3,Sinbads best movie,"I think this is Sindbad's best movie because I wasnt really into Housegeast with him and Phil Hartman. this is about the first kid(Brock Pierce) and his bodyguard(Timohty Busfield) gets fired and the replacement is Sinbad(damn hilarious) and Sinbad teaches him the ways of being a man, he teaches him how to dance and have fun and talk to girls, who Pierce is in love with this girl but a bully pints over her played by Zachery Ty Bryan(Home Improvment's Brad). a fun and charming movie with a cute cast and Sinbad's best, and where the hell is Sinbad anyway, we dont see him often now, what the frizz happened to him? is he living on a deserted island or something?"
2,"The movie ""First Kid""...","To say a nice thing about the movie ""First Kid"", well, it didn't totally suck all.Later, Much,Ethan"
5,Great stroller !!,Finally a stroller that looks real and is a reasonable price. A Christmas present so I am hoping my little grand daughter is going to love it.
2,Save yourself the money,I purchased this for my 27 month old daughter and it took me longer to open the box than it did for it to tear. Of course I returned it and went and bought one at Walmart. It was cheaper and still hasn't broken. She even sits in it and it sustains her.
5,she loves it!,My daugter pushes this toy around daily and loves o put her dolls in it. We've only used it inside so far and it has held up well.
1,Fell apart very quickly - could not repair,"This is a cute stroller but did not last AT ALL! The clip on the front wheel came off within two weeks and therefore the stroller is useless. My girls were so disappointed. Because of this one weak part, the whole stroller is junk now."
4,"Cute stroller, may not last long...","Bought this for my daughter's first birthday. It's a week away, so she hasn't gotten it yet. The material seems very thin and fragile. We also have a 3 year old son who is wide open. It will be interesting to see how long it stands up to his antics. I love that it has a basket underneath like Mommy's stroller. Very cute!"
3,good enough,"for the price its ok, not real strong but bought it for my 2 year old grand daughter. wish it was less money but hey"
4,Happy Granddaughters,Our twin granddaughters at 18 months have loved this baby stroller. It is just the right size for their dollies and has already provided hours of fun for the girls. Fortunately we already owned one so the girls are happy to each have their own mommy-like stroller for playtime now.
4,Excellent Doll Stroller,"This is a very nice stroller. I had purchased another doll stroller that was less exoensive, but does not compare to this one. I like the construction and fabric. My 18-month-old granddaughter loves the basket underneath and it is just the right size for her. She pushes it all over the house and uses it with the Corolle baby doll I gave her, which fits perfectly, although she also puts other dolls and animals in it. It's a real hit and I highly recommend it."
1,Talking Before Songs,"I purchased this CD (same cover - same songs)via BMG music club, and my copy has five songs: She Cried, Come Dance With Me, Sunday & Me, Crying, and Why Can't You Bring Me Home, which have voice outtakes before the music starts. This may be cool to some listeners, but to me it breaks up the beauty of the songs. Have any of you 5 star reviewers found the same to true on your CDs, or is this something exclusive to BMG?"
4,Some Great Songs Here!,"Along with The 4 Seasons, Jay & The Americans kept New York city group harmony singing popular until the late 1960's. Jay Black had a fantastic, Roy Orbison-like voice, and even did a great remake of ""Crying"". Most of the songs on this collection are really great. They are well-written with great arrangements and Jay's powerhouse lead vocals. One of the best vocal performances ever of the rock era is by Jay Black on ""Cara Mia"". Don't turn it up too loud or he'll blow out your speakers and shatter all the glassware in your house!"
4,Come a Little Bit Closer: The Best of Jay & the Americans,Some really great songs and some not so great. Cara Mia makes it all worthwhile.
3,Should be rereased to enable the current generation to enjoy,words cannot express the beauty of this album!
2,Why The Unnecessary Chatter?,"While I liked the album for the most part, two of my favorite songs ""She Cried"" and ""Crying"" had ABSOLUTELY AND COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY chatter by the recording producer/engineer BEFORE each song which effectively killed the mood of the album. I didn't buy the album to listen to some bozos talking, I just wanted to hear the singing!!"
4,Very Enjoyable,"With each book, Laurien Berenson gets better and better. I thoroughly enjoyed her latest book, Unleashed. Her mysteries are good, but I really think I read her books for the extreme enjoyment I get from her descriptions of life with her son and Faith, the poodle. The behind scenes look at what goes on and into a dog show are fascinating. Though I didn't exactly like the ending of Unleashed (as those of you who have already read it will know what I mean), I am looking forward to her next book and hearing what life is going to be like with a 6 year old, a 2 year old poodle and 6 poodle puppies. If you love dogs, don't pass this wonderful author by."
4,My 7 year Old's Favorite Annie's Flavor,"Annie's Mac & Cheese are the only organic and/or natural pasta mixes that I think are worth buying. Tried many flavors and I've never had a bad one. My 7 yr. old son LOVES the Peace Noodles. They are very garlicly, and while I like them too, I don't really care for any strangely shaped pasta - they all have about a :30 window of cooking perfection -- too short and they are too hard, too long and they crumble.Also, unlike Kraft, where you can make the sauce right in the pan with the drained noodles, Annies' doesn't have as many (or any) emulsifiying type ingredients, so the sauce can get lumpy if you make it in the pan. I have the kids mix the sauce in a separate bowl while the noodles are cooking."
2,Two Different Bands!,"Description is NOT of this title or band. The title is for the 60's psychedelic band The Godz...NOT to be confused with the 70's hard rock band out of Akron, Ohio (which I happen to prefer) which is what is being described here. The is a very common mistake on many seller's websites. And don't even get me started on all of the confusion over the multitude of artists that have and/or still use the name Angel!!!"
1,Agree with other review,"We agree, Kevin Harvick and Dale Jr. should have been on the cover. Personally, I wouldn't put Biffle's picture on the last page let alone on the cover ! Race fans forever !"
5,"""Way back Machine""","I for some strange reason was thinking of my youth-you do that when you are 60. I remembered these rockets and the fun I had with them. I had not seen one in decades but there they were on Amazon.HINT!!! Get a rocket loaded and ready to go and tell a ""Friend"" if you place it near your face and aim you can use it as a guided missle.Physics will make his a little upset with you"
3,Deluxe Water Rocket,My son likes it but would like it to go higher. It goes 20-30 feet. He learned alot about water pressure.
1,I had this toy as a child...,"I had this as a kid, and I was rough on toys! It was a tough well used toy enjoyed by many. Unfortunately, the remake is Chinese communist junk. That's what happens when no one cares. If the manufacturer would reproduce this toy as it was when I was a kid I'd have purchased 5 at twice the price for my son and nephews. To whomever is producing this, congratulations you've ruined a great American toy beloved by many for generations.The original was thick red plastic, looked a like the one in the middle, and you could run over it in a 1970s full sized car."
3,Pump and large rocket are junk - perhaps get other kit with 1 rocket and 1 pump,"As others have mentioned, the large rocket has too large a nozzle opening, and the pump is not very durable.If you decide to go for it anyway, I'd recommend getting a couple of these instead:AQUA LAUNCH Water Powered SPACE ROCKET kids TOY NEW [Toy]You get one rocket and one pump in each package. You'll end up with two small rockets and two pumps. Much more useful to have an extra pump - your odds of getting a serviceable one are much better this way."
1,Doesn't hold up under pressure,When I was a kid I love water rockets. I bought these for my grandsons and was so disappointed. they would not hold pressure when pumped up. the highest I got one to go was about ten feet. but most of the time it lost pressure Fizzled out and fell to the ground. Sooo disappointed.
1,Junk Junk,"Junk. Do not buy. Nothing like the quality of our childhood water rockets. Do not buy. It leaked immediately. I purchased 6 of them since I knew they do not last forever, but all six I purchased leaked or just flat out did not work."
1,A piece off leaky junk! Do not waste your $$$!,"This item does not function at all. Leaks out water and does nothing. I have used this same type product made by another manufacturer and it works great, but this item is of the lowest in quality.I grew up using one of these and they went almost 100 ft up this product is a total joke and their description is in their dreams!"
1,Deluxe Water Rocket set by Toysmith,"I should have read the reviews before ordering this item as I wouln't recommend purchasing the water rocket set. As with the other reviews, this product is not as good as the water rockets of the past. The main problem is the pump doesn't work well at all. If you pump up the rocket like a mainiac you might be luckey to get a 30 foot launch but will also end up breaking the plastic pump. Most younger kids wont be able to make the rocket launch at all because the pump is junk. Also the rockets are about 1/3 of the size of the rockets from +20 years ago."
1,Major disappintment,"I was hoping this would be just like the ones I had when I was a kid 35 years ago. Those would go 50+ feet easily. This is horrible. I had this big build-up to show my kids how it works right out of the package. I warned them to ""stand back"" and ""I don't want you to get hurt"". What a let down. The thing went about 3 fee up and fizzled. The highest I think I ever got it in many tries was maybe 10-12 feet. This is absolute junk. I'm glad it didn't taint my childhood memories of the working water rockets. Don't buy this. You will be disappointed."
1,Piece of garbage right out of the package.,"What an absolute joke this thing was. I remember when I had one of these 30 years ago and it would go so much higher. It lasted for months. This time? My son and I went outside and it never went more than 20 feet high. On the fourth attempt, the rocket landed on the roof and never worked again due to a hairline crack in the very brittle plastic. It would never pressurize with air again and has been sent directly to the trash can. DO NOT WASTE A PENNY ON THIS CHEAPLY MADE CRAP!!!!!!!!!"
1,leaked too much,Wouldn't go over 5 feet most trips and only the fist attempt made it to 10 feet. I think something in the pump has too much leakage. I later read the instructions and it said to use oil and I still haven't tried that but we have lost interest and have left it outside to rot in the dirt.
1,NEVER WORKED: DO NOT BUY,"I remember these water rockets from my childhood - there wasn't much that was more fun.So it was extremely disappointing to buy one for my son for his birthday, and make a big deal about shooting it off, only to have the thing never work.Design is the same as I remember, but the manufacturiing quality is extremely poor. Find another source.Sean"
1,lame,"I was expecting a rocket that could fly... these are very small, hold very little water and barely work. Lame..."
3,purchaser,Works as I remember from many years ago. Purchased as a Christmas gift.Kids should love it.
2,Better Buy!,"This launcher may be alright for very young kids but the durability factor is less than impressive. The pump can only withstand lower pressures which means the rockets will not fly too high. The ""rockets"" that come with are fine except for the fact that once they break they are done and you are out of a rocket. The best water rocket system that I have purchased and repeatedly used was found on eBay under ""soda bottle rocket launcher."" This launcher allows you to use soda bottles (easily replaceable) and holds very high pressures (incredible heights). Check it out!"
5,Had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.,"Stephen King does it yet again! Storm of the Century had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Stephen can create a villian better than anyone I've ever seen. If you didn't like storms before this, you'll dislike them even more afterward. Grab yourself some popcorn, a blanket, and turn off the lights. There's a storm comin'.... Way to go."
4,One of King's best!,"I remember watching this for the first time when it was released a mini series on TV. I was blown away, mesmerized even. I love how King took his time with the plot and as always his attention to detail. I've found people either love or hate this movie. More than anything I like what he did with the character of Andre Linoge. How his character is never fully explored, hardly ever says anything throughout the entire movie. But for me, that makes his charaacter even better. You don't need a character to be completely developed and blabbering the entire movie to be good. This was the first of Colm Feore's movies that I saw and I was very much impressed. I'll even go as far as to say his acting is the best of the cast, just behind him is Tim Daly of course. Great movie though."
4,LOVED IT,"I have seen this movie about 3 times and to me its one of Stephen King's best, it kept me interested from start to finish."
4,Great Movie!!,"This movie is great. One thing i think is bad about the DVD, is that there are not many special features. There are a few but i ezpected more for such a long movie that is originally a miny series. Still a good movie. But i think there could be more features or maybe 2 discs."
1,josh,what a rip off DVD case came with only one of the 2 sides for the movie. BE CAREFUL!!!!!! They sent me 1/2 a movie
3,Mixed Feelings,"My wife and I just rented ""Storm of the Century"" on DVD and didn't realize that it was a miniseries at first. The characters are good and the acting well done, I can't really think of any flat acting that stood out to me. Tim Daly as the local constable and voice of reason (paid $6,000 a year and worth every penny) was very good. The villain was very well done and very creepy. However I think the story is too long in places: for example, after Linoge is locked up, the sequence goes on for too long... this movie could have been cut by an hour and still have been very effective."
4,wicked,this movis into gae dragged at first theyt take 2 hours too arrest the man then on side two it finally kick
2,storm of the century,my movie played terrible as soon as it got in the middle.i was so up set cause i love that movie i was so happy when i found it i couldnt wait till i got it and for it to do me like that was very wrong.
1,Ummmm...OK...I'm lost.....,"Seems as though I'm the only one who HATED this movie.lolThis movie made NO sense what-so-ever,had a brain-numbing plot and not enough GORE!!!If you're suffering from insomnia then buy this movie....you'll be counting sheep in NO time at all."
1,One of the most disappointing and dragging movies,The first 30 minutes aroused my curiosity. After that it moved at such a slow pace that I felt asleep at least twice. I also lost my interest. There's no suspense or horror in the remaining part.Pet Sematary and The Mist (2008) are much more suspenseful and scarier.
4,Well 3 and a half really - listen and take note,"OK, I love science fiction - Stephen King - and long movies (give you more in-depth characterisation)and loved the Stand for example (Although IT was always my fabourite). But I am also honest and wont get swayed by what I hoped would be an excellent movie, remember a high rating is normally ascertained and potential low markers wont bother with a complaining review. I thought I had to. The film started perfectly, no waiting for action - and when the evil arrived in Maine, and got seen! , he still didnt go away. This had be on the edge of my seat. The middle slowed a bit but was still quite good (the file should have been about 3 - 3.5 hours). The ending was a problem, there should have been more to the ending, and more time should have been spent on the bad character and his profile and past. Id give this 3.5 and call it an average to good film, nothing more."
3,Reading the screen play was better,"The screen play was definetly better. The dvd version was decent, the acting not the best, and you can tell it was made for television. Some of the graphics were obviously fake. The story behind it though was pretty good, although it could have been cut from four hours to two hours. You can read the book in less time. If you got nothing to do, its worth a watch, though it's probably more interesting if you haven't read the book, there is the element of surprise."
3,Better than average King mini with different ending,"I was surprised that I actually liked the ending to 'Storm of the Century', Stephen King's mini series about a small blizzard ravaged town who gets visited by a great evil. Without any spoilers, I have to say that the ending comes out of left field and, although not quite a happy ending, it was definately different and strangely satisfying.The series itself is pretty good. I would actually rate it 3 and a half stars. Tim Daly and the rest of the cast are pretty good, especially Canadian actor Colm Feore as Linoge, the dark stranger raising supernatural chaos. Although he is quite evil, the terror that he brings is not too apparant. He has all these evil powers and such, but he doesn't really bring them to bear on the hapless citizens. There is something the townspeople have that he wants, but I figure if you can do magic, heck, just take what it is you want.Still, it's good viewing, especially for King fans."
4,terrifying in portrayal of human nature,Another great experience from the master - Stephen King. It's more than the snow that makes this chilling!
3,scary movie for Stephen King fans,"Slow moving movie that will be enjoyed by all King fans and those who like a building up of the tension, as a small town begins to crack under increasing pressure from a demanding visitor who brings a smashing winter storm with him. The villain is very believeble, right down to his seaman's cap and smug smile."
4,King takes 1999 by a STORM...,"Master storyteller, Stephen King has done it again. ""Storm of the Century"" is an overtly terrifying movie, and the scariest thing is not the signature ""boogey-man"", but being faced with our inner selves. What would you do if placed in a situation in which none of the choices look good? This is the message conveyed in ""Storm"" and what a horrifying message it is. With outstanding performances by Tim Daly (Wings), Debrah Farentino (EARTH 2), and Colm Feore (City of Angels) this movie is a must see."
1,Storm of the century - now worth the time invested,"This movie has a great beginning, great middle but horrid ending. So dissapointing it makes watching the whole thing a really bad experience. DO NO SPEND YOUR TIME watching this movie."
1,Don't waste your time,"I really like Stephen King, but this has got to be one of his worst works ever. EVER. The plot is intruiging, but the movie is sooooo long. It's like, what, five hours? The movie pulls you in with an interesting begining, and keeps you watching with a so-so middle, but there is really no point. There is so much unneccesary information and there are so many pointless scenes. Yeah, like, seven people or so die, but there isn't really anything all too exciting about it. After a while, this movie becomes quite annoying, and you just want to see what the guy wants, and what he wants is rather idiotic, and is very anti-climactic. So, in my opinion, don't waste your time watching this."
2,A Real Disappointment,"When it first aired as a ""big event"" television miniseries, it was rightly billed as King's first ""novel for television."" That is its only merit.The pace is slow, interspersed with brief moments of suspense. The actors, chief among them Timothy Daly and Colm Feore, do fine with their less-than-fully developed characters.The real letdown is the end ""flying sequence."" Such a cheesy effect for a film that was supposedly a special event.One reviewer has placed this one on the same level as the superlative King television adaptation of ""The Stand."" I, on the other hand, place ""Storm of the Century"" with ""It"" as being highly touted but very much a letdown.This ""storm"" isn't ""perfect"" by a long shot!"
3,Pretty Good for a King Adaptation,"I did not mind this when I saw it. I watched it with my parents and brother, and much to my shock, we all enjoyed it. I think a lot of credit goes to Tim Daly in the role of ineffectual hero, who is a likable and collected guy and reacts in a mostly logical fashion to the illogical things going on around him.It is by no means high art, but it isn't a bad use of your time."
2,I was so disapointed,I will be short because a lot of people realy like this move.I however felt like it dragged out for ever and had no real suspence and the ending was -for me- a letdown not Kings best work in my humble opinion.
5,"This movie Gives You What You Want, so don't let it get away","This is my all time favorite movie ever! It is 6 hours of pure entertainment. I cried so hard at the end , it was scary. A movie has never moved me so much before. I read the screenplay before i saw the movie, so I knew what was going to happen, but i cried and got scared and felt sad anyway. I suggest you buy this movie now! You are in for the best 6 hours of your life."
3,'MY' Storm of the Century!!!,"Right now, I am at the Fire Station in Kentucky because for the last 6 days, we have been without power. Ice knocked over power lines and huge tree limbs are down. It has been tough, but I think I'll make it. Anyway....This is a pretty good Stephen King movie! An evil stranger named Andre Linoge comes to the town of Little Tall Island during a big snow storm. He knows everyones' dark secrets. When he kills one of the town's residents, he is taken to jail and keeps saying ""Give me what I want, and I'll go away."" What does this stranger want? I suggest to watch STORM OF THE CENTURY!!!"
5,Horror is character folks,"With the tentacles of special effects wrapping around our eyes these days, it's so refreshing to see a film that gives us characters to care about and a story that harks all the way back through our genes back to the times of sitting around a fire - SOTC is simple; the boogeyman comes to town and he's gonna take what he wants or all you all suffer. Not gonna say what he wants, but it scares us, young and old alike. King's myth is beautifully realized on screen and makes me wonder why I'm spending my money at the cineplex on all the effects driven, gore splattered eye candy - give me what I want and I'll go away? SOTC gave me what I wanted (AN ENGROSSING STORY) and I still keep coming back!"
3,Is it just me?,"Or is Colm Feore the voice of the VISA commercials? I couldn't help laughing out loud every time he said ""Born of sin, come on in.."" because I expected that to be followed with ""...but bring your VISA card because in Hell the coals are warming up and they don't take any card from American Express"". Otherwise watchable King fare but could probably have been wrapped up in two hours."
2,They needn't have bothered.,"8 Mar 2011""Storm of the Century"" is an amateurish production. Strictly for adolescents. When the fangs were shown too soon, not even the director had confidence in holding viewer attention,I concluded. The fangs, in fact, disturbed the then continuity of the mystery. That the one who forfeited the most lived happily ever after is bizarre. I'd sooner watch Hitchcock's birds--easily more believable. Signed Merry Oakley"
2,Um..... Pretty Weird and Not Scary,"This movie is yet ANOTHER of Steven King's pretty retarded and well...er.- ""interesting"" books,- then made into a movie. The killer kind of scares me, and his classic line ""Born of sin? Come on in"" is pretty hilarious I thought! This movie is NOT an intense, thrilling, action-horror movie,- but rather an eerie, slow, and mysterious one."
5,Definitely the scariest film I have seen!!!,"I was scared, laughing, scared, intrigued, scared all at once! Deffinitely the best horror film I have seen, it's esppecially great on DVD!"
5,Outstanding!,"I think this is one of Kings best! It had all the suspense and thrill that you expect from a Stephen King flick with some interesting extras. The actors delivered a magnificent performance, especially Colme Feore! If you have 4 hours to spare one day, I highly recommend seeing ""Storm Of The Century"" and if your a fan of Stephen King, this is a must-see."
4,best work to date; DVD commentary by King is worth the buy,"I think Storm of the Century is King's best TV work to date (that's not saying much; I thought both The Stand and The Shining were too long and boring). Everything came together for this production (I still think King should be restricted to four, rather than six hours for his teleplays). What King needs to do is more original teleplays, something we haven't seen before.And the DVD, man, picture and sound are great. The mini-series is split on both sides. I've always liked to listen to King talk (the banter between King and late-night hose Conan O'Brien is always funny, lively and interesting) and the DVD commentary doesn't disappoint. All King fans should get this disc, whether or not you liked the movie, because King is really a lot of fun to listen to."
5,Born In Vice....Say It Twice...Say It Twice.,"The Best Stephen King Movie Made to date, bar none, With tons of DVD extras. You can not go wrong at all on this purchase, it has a high rating, and deserves every bit of it."
5,What a Bone Chilling tale.,"i've always liked scary films, weather they were on television or video . i really like the stuff from steven king he gave me the creeps in IT when it came out , but this one tops his previous works that came to the small screen . this story is very chilling to bone, it numbs your senses you'll be in a daze after you watch this winner. have a frightful , screaming time as you watch it, highly Recommended. P.S. for those with sensitive hearts Beware, it may stress you out! supported by great cast maybe a broken one haaaa."
4,If you're looking for durability...,"Then this is the tank for you! I own both the 35mm and the 120mm tanks, and they have lasted me years so far.PROS- VERY durable- Well made, obviously light-tight- Lid fits on like a glove- Larger opening for easy pouring in/out of chemicalsCONS- Not as easy to use as the plastic counter-parts- Inner clip is poorly designed, I mostly ignore it.I would not suggest this tank for the total beginner - while some would disagree and tell the budding developer to get over it, I have seen several people give up on home developing because they found this just too difficult to use in the dark. It takes some practice, but once you get it, it becomes muscle memory. If you have already used the metal tanks, or are looking for something more durable, this is an EXCELLENT choice."
3,Could have been better,"This book was not well organized. Although it proported to be a history of the Gestapo, there was little coverage of its organization, strength or its leadership."
3,above average vacation read,"I read this book on the beach of the ritz-carlton in St Thomas.It was the ideal setting for a story dealing with the BermudaTriangle. It is a easy read for a mindless day. The story moves about rather quickly and as with other novels in this day and age,location descriptions are brief and sketchy. While, the author touches on a couple of weird situations which could happen, it is ends upbeing a run-of-the-mill, semi-predictable story. The story is not exactly original for as it borrows plot elements from both WilliamHope Hodgeson and Dennis Wheatley. Pick this book up if :a) you need a lazy summer readb) enjoy reading about the bermuda triangle.c) vacationing in the islands"
5,Great chairs,"This is the second time I have purchased these chairs (to add to the first ones.) We love them. They are amazingly comfortable, attractive, light-weight and durable. We leave them outside year-round, and they still look like new. We have both sizes: the regular for shorter people and the larger size for those 6-footers. Perfect."
4,comfortable!,"So comfortable you can sleep in them...the only thing we don't like is they're are hard to store.They're heavy to lift and they don't fold up very flat which maks it difficult to store in a rv. But they are heavy and made well, so the heavy contruction, should let them last for awhile."
4,better pricing,"The overall chair is very nice. one thing not liked is the mesh fabric does not go all the way to the bottom of the frame. it is ok for shorter people, but for tall people 6' and over their ankles hit this open area which is uncomfortable. I went on line to purchase this chair because of the weight holding factor. This means a person 350 pounds is probably going to be tall. Also I could not find a green chair. Lots for sale in my area at better prices, just not green."
1,Save your money,I purchased this chair about three months ago it has already started tearing away from the gromits and needs new fabric! I also found a chair just like it at a local store on sale for half the price and its still fine. Im sure just about any chair would be a better choice at this price.
4,Good for Bad Backs!,"I purchased this chair for my Dad who has been having lower back problems. It is very comfortable and locks in position. The only fault I can see is that it is difficult to get in and out of, as the bar at the foot is in the way and you have to step on it to get in or out. A little cumbersome for folks with back probs."
4,Songs Included:,"Anne of Green Gables Gee, I'm Glad I'm No One Else but Me Ice Cream Kindred Spirits Learn Ev'rything Wond'rin' Summer"
1,Misleading Picture on Sandpaper,"I go through many packs of sandpaper a week. I've found that the oxide sandpapers are the only sandpaper that stays sharp any length of time.What is listed on this ad isn't oxide sandpaper, it is the low end porter cable regular sandpaper. This is the stuff that dulls quickly, clogs quickly.The picture that is listed as I write this is a grey color. What I received is the typical low end maroon paper from porter cable that is miserable.I don't know if this is some purposeful misrepresentation, I suspect it may be.Charlatan-ism is alive and well, and has come to roost in this ad listedon Amazon."
3,"Nice components, unattractive packaging","Normally I could care less about packaging, but this was a gift for a 10 year-old (and if you know a 10YO, you know how picky they can be), and the packaging was less than stellar. A plastic envelope with poorly printed graphics and text doesn't cut it. Find it somewhere else."
2,Try something else,This certain charger does not work for the r707. I live in Germany so I had to wait a whole 2 1/2 weekes before I recieved this because there is no express service. Just spend the money to get the regular adapter
5,Buy it!,"At first I thought this battery charger was specific for HP cameras but when I received the package I found out that it is a general charger, however it works perfectly for my camera battery. It also brings a car charger which is very conveniant. I think it has great quality for the price. I definitely recommend this product."
5,BUENISIMO!!!!,"Este disco de Jessica es buenisimo, Bien juvenil, bailable y romantico. Soy un admirador de esta artista hace tres años. Si quieren se pueden comunicar conmigo otros admiradores de Jessica. Mi e-mail: david_laureano@hotmail.comSE LO RECOMIENDO..."
2,Sensual? Not So Much,"I love Flamenco music but I have to say I was expecting softer and, I don't know... ""sensual"" tracks perhaps. TWO of the tracks are pretty great, the rest of the tracks are anything but sensual. In fact some border on annoying. Another annoying thing: the track titles on the actual disc do NOT match the back of the CD or the liner notes - apparently the titles are from another disc altogether - entitled ""Lands of Beauty."" Although I have to give props to the last track ""The National Anthem"" which is pretty patriotic yet comes off like a lullaby.The two tracks that are worthy of replay are (especially #5) ""Solitude"" and #4 ""Imagine Your in Love"" - (should be ""You're""). This disc is a mess. My buying advice is buy music from Ottmar Liebert, Peter White, Jesse Cook, Al Dimeola, Paco DeLucia, John McLaughlin, Acoustic Alchemy, Armik and even Esteban."
5,The best collection for the best price,This is the Ventures collection I've been waiting for. And the price is right.
4,Another Best Of,"For some artists it is relatively easy to list a best of collection but not so The Ventures. Don't get me wrong this is an excellent album and is well worth a look but I am not sure it is a better ""best of"" than a few of their other ""best of"" albums."
4,"Not Bad, But Doesn't Seem To Age Well","I am being generous with 4 stars. It seems to me that the music sounds dated and doesn't age well. Not particularly interesting with so much other instrumental music to choose from. Also, the curse of any ""best of"" album is that there is always going to be something missing that someone thinks should be on there. Wasn't Pipeline a big, big Ventures hit? Also Telstar was quite popular too. Those are the only two Ventures songs that I recall getting consistent radio play, but perhaps I just missed hearing a lot of the other songs. Still, the album seems incomplete without Pipeline. Some of the songs are more interesting and innovative than others, which is why this probably deserves 4 stars."
2,Purchased for reference,"Musically this album is very limited. I bought it to learn the lead guitar part for 'Walk Don't Run'. This collection of the Ventures' music displays the lack diversity in the Ventures' sound with the exception of the theme from 'Hawaii Five-O', (which seems totally out of place). Probably the best part of the album is the included radio interviews that lend some insight into the personality of the artists and gives some sense of the era in which the music was written."
5,A Dream Come Through,"Got my copy in HMV Japan last August and although I paid quite a fortune for the DVDs, every penny is worth it. There is nothing but pure good music from the maestro Chick Corea and friends. A well worth investment if I musy say., after all this event is only once in a lifetime and thank you Chick for sharing your beautiful music with us."
2,Horrible Packaging. Great performances.,The packaging is horrible. One of the DVD holders was smashed and had caused damage to one of the best DVD's. Unacceptable.The performances are great if you are a Chick fan. If you are just a casual listener don't buy this. You'll probably get bored.
1,Worst cake ever!,"My Mother just received her Miss Grace Lemon Cake for Mother's Day 2012. I was shocked when she told me that it was so nasty that she had to throw it away. She felt bad that I wasted my money. AND to prove it she immediately sent one to me so I could judge for myself. It is true. This cake had hard nasty tasting lemon icing and it was dry like cardboard. I am furious because this was a total ripoff and even my sweet toothed Husband who basically eats anything hated it. Save your money people, trust me on this!"
3,Watch out for these!!,"First, these are sold separately, not in pairs. I realized this too late and luckily so. The first one I ordered came loose in a plain brown box. The second one came from another warehouse in a sealed red Brembo box and is obviously manufactured much better, especially noticeable in the venting. I would never have known if I had ordered a pair in the first place, hence the conflicting reviews on this page about authenticity. I returned them both instead of wait for another one to arrive which may or may not turn out to be the real deal. Luckily Amazon makes returns simple and easy."
3,MADE IN CHINA,These rotors are made in China not Italy they do fit my car properly and have not given me any trouble we will see how they hold up.
5,Great BUTTT,"These are quality rotors and they were sent very promptly with a email notification sent shortly after.BUT. These do NOT fit a Acura TSX 04-08. I was sent one by accident. I figured I'd add this.Other wise, great cheap rotors."
5,Perfect match for Accord,"Arrived in time... matched them with ceramic Monroe pads also from Amazon. So far I put around 1.5K miles and no complains, much quieter than original one. Would definitely buy them again"
4,Babies Fall Silent,My daughter (1.5 years old) always falls silent and stares rapt at the squeaky-voiced geezer on the screen. The only other artist she shows the same reverence for is the Beatles (especially the Help! film/dvd) so I guess that's saying something. I found it a little less satisfying than say WELD or even the BBC film of his solo television appearance in the early 70s but it is still worth a watch. I have to say I found some of the songs tedious (My ole daddy went a walking one day...) both musically and in terms of sentiment and one more thing: how do you think Neil's dad Scott Young (still alive at that time) would have felt to hear a song which has already clearly consigned him to the graveyard?
5,Last Cut Alone Worth Price of Admission,"What a sellar performance! In these bleak and worrying times, just listen to the sheer joy in Neil's final song in this set. ""Good to See You"" must be seen and heard to be believed; Neil's playing is impeccable on all cuts, but is particularly noticable here. How could one not be uplifted by such a great song? Highly recommended for anyone who loves fine acoustic performances. This is certainly one of the very best available -- bar none!"
4,"Not Great, But Good",im 53 now and i've seen Neil Young live many times. And i've seen lots of his tapes and dvds. This on is very good ( not great ) but good. If you want to check out Mr. Young live and raw check out this dvd. I think your going to like this one.
2,Disappointing,"Excellent sound quality but Neil's performance seems a shadow of his former self.This is flaccid stuff. Heavy on guitars, light on artistic content. If he was a baseball pitcher he would have hung up his glove, or whatever accoutrements apply, long ago.Perhaps this is what Bob Dylan means when he talks about technology having outpaced art. Great sound, negligible content.This is not the spirt of rock, but of rococo."
4,Silver and Gold-Neil Young,"I just received a 62 minute Neil Young treasure on DVD. The music(accoustic guitar, harmonica, and piano/organ) is breathtakng with DD5.1 and linear PCM. The picture quality from video tape source is like looking into a clear glass-You're there! Clearly a must-have. His best accoustic work since Harvest-ENJOY."
4,Neil bears his soul!,"This is a fantastic set of mostly new songs delivered in very stripped down arrangements, just Neil and guitar, or piano, organ, and sometimes harmonica. Having seen Neil in other settings, with Crazy Horse, Booker T. and the MGs, CSN & Y, as well as solo with and without backup, this is that rare treat.The sound is excellent and the picture quality is very good. You could practically reach out and grab his beer. I was just waiting for him to pick up the banjo, but he never did!"
2,Doesn't always work,"I have had an Owl for years, but the two that I recently purchased do not work well when pressed. Disappointed!"
3,"Good, but not great.","Not bad, not that good. I would find something better and brighter if I was to do it all over again."
5,Fabulous and Fun!,"We bought this for our just-turned-6-year-old. She's only been in Kindergarten a few months so hasn't been exposed to many of these skills in school, I was concerned it would be too hard. She is usually frustrated when she can't get something right, but this offers appropriate positive reinforcing clues so that she can get it right. She loves it. She has only had it three days and has played all the games, her favorite is the missing letter spelling game. The first day she received it, she had to count on her fingers to do +1, today she has +1, +2 and -1 all for memory. She picks it up a few times a day for at least 15-20 minutes each. The point based award system keeps her motivated. I also love the volume control, repeat button, and the fact that you can practice very specific math skills. Bravo. Fabulous Toy."
4,Excellent String,"This is an excellent string. Nice top spin, good control but very..very..very expensive. The best string so far for me but less durable than others."
5,Better Than Expected..,"Fast delivery, book description was ""good"" arrived in better condition than was described, good packaging, low cost.Thanks a lot, will use their services again.."
5,Well Researched,"This book was very well researched. Although it is a historical novel, it is true to history and accurate. It is a good read."
4,Elizabeth Her men,"This is a lengthy book covering the life of Elizabth and the men who played pivotal roles in her reign and her life. The author successfully captures the intricacies of Ellizabth in her dealings withnthe ambitions of the men in her world, the politics of her kingdom in relation to the rest of the European nations and monarchies and the trials of a female monarch in the male dominated society. The author reveals Elizabeth's frailties, foiables and insecurities, but also carefully portrays her strengths and political savvy. It is very entertaining and a good read"
5,I've Married Myself --- To England,"What genius?!~! What utterly brilliant spirit had possessed Susan Kay to write something so marvelous and sincere and leave it to the unworthy readers of this earth? And such sheer brilliance is only left to be ""out of PRINT?"" Lunacy...I daresay she is the most talented writer ever leaved-- she knows how to manipulate her audience and hypnotizes them into the wholeness of her characters and style of romantic, Gothic writing. Legacy was not half as good as ""Phantom"", but it suffices the need to know, from all women, that there was once someone who stood against men like an unfaltering brick wall ; and no matter how many stones were thrown upon her, she stayed immune to it's cruel pain.How is it possible that a ""woman"" such as Kay can achieve such great heights with words?read it, and learn :)"
5,Historical fiction done well!,"Unlike the trash heaps by Philippa Gregory or Laurien Gardner, Susan Kay actually wrote a compelling novel AND kept history intact. A tough balance act but she managed it. Ever the master of human emotion Kay builds up Elizabeth's emotional turmoil from Anne Boleyn's miserable end to the execution of her last favorite, Lord Essex. Chilling and colorful this book brings Elizabeth to life like no other novel I've read before or since. One can hate this Queen Bess at one moment only to love her at the next, like the real life queen Kay's Elizabeth keeps you guessing and when she reaches the emotional breaking point over having Mary Stuart executed one cannot help but feel for this woman. EXQUISITE in every way!"
4,Pacific Coast Slumb Core,"I agree with the other review, that this is great pillow if you have neck pain. It is nice and soft scushy feel with inside support that is not visable but you feel it the next day. I gave it 4 stars because I do not like the outter shell. It is stiff. The pillow is a good value and after reviewing Pacific Coast web site, they make down items for Amazon. We still have a 30 day guarente with a 5 year warente I called. It has no pillow protecter with it,that is a con on my list."
5,Best Fender for Small Boats,"I bought this to replace one I lost when the line came loose.I've used the standard cylindrical fenders and found they are not much use for small boats. This style fender has a split that allows it to hug my boat around the rub rail. The rectangular cross section means it hugs the hulls and is less likely to ride up when being squeezed between the boat hull and pier.For small boats, this is the only style fender anyone needs."
2,DVD a letdown...,"I saw the show in Seattle and it was a great experience. Live shows have that affect though. Even if the sound is bad, it still sounds good, just 'cause it's live, but not on this dvd. And certainly not the way this DVD is presented.I was really hoping see more of a ""set"" from each band. At least a few songs in a row hopefully. This DVD is no more than a visual sampler of the bands and their live performances in poor quality. This was all shot at one show and throughout the duration of the tour. so what you hear is what you get. some of the performances are not of the bands best.I really enjoyed the used performance live, as well as MCR's, and i was hoping to see more than just a SINGLE performance each on the dvd! I mean cmon, they were the headliners!! only two songs total!? not even the under pressure colaboration, which was really great!dont buy the dvd. buy the actual albums and find a show next year for TOC2. itll be well worth it rather than this letdown."
2,"i went to the TOC is my town, way better than this...","great bands, ok songs, the sound quality is HORRIBLE! why does every band i see in person suck on dvd? the show was way better when i went. The Used headlined the tour & only got 1 song on the dvd...Saosin played better but unfortunately didn't make it on the dvd. Underoath didn't play at the TOC i went to and i'm glad they didn't beacuse they play horribly on this dvd. buy the Epitaph Tour 2005 dvd instead, or save your money when something decent comes along"
2,Confessions of a Cat Killer,"I'm not sure what is the greater act of stupidity: Nazi-like killing of cats for medical experimentation OR being a public figure and writing about it in your autobiography.Cat killer enthusiasts will also enjoy the original and artistic film on the subject entitled ""Gummo"" (...)"
4,good light!,"this light is heavy but once you get in the water, the water makes it lighter. The light itself could be brighter, but it is very functional, the beam is very tight. Overall is a good dive light, easy to handle."
3,...artifical flav is not quite as good as the real thing...,"I had to get this single, being a huge Meat Beat Manifesto and Public Enemy fan, and the track they picked was one of the best PE songs in my opinion. However, after giving the disc much play time, I still don't think that it stacks up compared to the original and is more of a novelty. Chuck D is at his best, but Flav is not present, and the vocoded or processed vocals compensate for his punch, but they seem to stumble or interfere most of the time. You can definitely hear the production of Jack Dangers through this track, but the repetition and predictability in the track are not indicative of his handywork. This may seem caustic, but I feel that if this were a dominantly Meat Beat or Jack Dangers single it would have been so powerful and funky that you could smell it! This version is alright...but the original is much better (on ""Fear of a Black Planet"")."
4,Science with a Sense of Humor,"This highly-readable book discusses the merits of raw milk, along with such related topics as mothers' milk, the eating of meat, and the effect (or, rather, lack thereof) of dietary cholesterol on the human heart. I found Dr. Douglass to be witty, well-informed, and respectful of readers with a wide variety of worldviews (although there is some mild coarse language throughout). This is not an overly scientific book, which may be seen as either a benefit or a downfall, depending on your reason for reading. I only gave it four stars because it is in dire need of proofreading/editing."
4,The Milk Book is Definitely Worth Reading,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who got me started on raw milk. I had been one of those who had believed the hype about unprocessed milk being dirty or harmful to your health. However, people have been drinking milk straight from the cows on their own farms for years without any major illnesses! The author does a great job of telling the history of milk and comparing raw milk to pasturized milk. This book is very comprehensive and quite interesting, although sometimes the author tries to get too humorous on the subject. I have been drinking raw milk for a while now without any health problems. Love the taste! This book is definitely worth reading for anyone interested in health and wellness."
1,Ridiculous,"I was looking for a book that discussed the milk controversy in depth. I found this book to be silly and a waste of my time and money. If you are looking for a well-researched discussion on this topic, read The China Study."
5,"okay, how about...""hell yeah!""","This may not be much of an informative review for potential buyers. However, for those in the know, you'll likely agree: THIS BAND F**KING RULES! I was curious if they would be able to top The Strangest Things. If i were a cat, that curiosity would have me trampled under an 18 wheeler. This record is so great. Interpol fans should trade in their monotone singing hero for a real band with as much writing skill and ability as much as sound. I found these guys by chance on a random internet radio station. Stoked. Hope nothing but good things happens for these guys. Great record and can't wait to see'em live."
2,major dissapoinment 2nd effort,"strong debut cd, this 2nd album is a real letdown for me. only the single hit me as anything worth remembering."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"By looking at the picture, I assumed there were more colors, and larger sizes, but I was wrong, and can't use them for what I had in mind."
3,"Good, but ....","This book is a good general overview, but it misses some important stuff that someone who is generally unfamiliar with the publishing business will need to know before attempting to start a magazine.I found the book lacking in the basic details I needed to know, such as where to find distributors, how to get a UPC code, how to recruit new writers, etc. For a basic overview and particularly for the marketing side of owning a magazine (which is very important), I'd recommend this book. For the nuts-and-bolts stuff I'd recommend the e-book, ""How Not to Start a Magazine,"" published by Palfrey Media ..."
2,Falls Woefully Short,"Starting a magazine, as I have done, requires more than just an editorial plan. Woodard's book does a nice job of establishing what needs to go into an editorial plan but it completely ignores production issues, printing, advertising and funding. It's a little like telling someone how to design a car without mentioning that in addition to nice upholstery and great body work it needs an engine and tires. Put another way, she only talks about the part of the iceberg you can see."
2,Not very useful,"I did not find this book to be very useful. For one thing, it seems to assume that if you're going to publish a magaine you had better have a lot of money. I didn't have a lot of money, so this book started out by making me feel like I ought to throw my idea away. Second, it has a lot of information about management (how to make business decisions, budgeting, strategy, subscribers are a leaking bucket, blah blah) but I was already past that. I just wanted to know how to get started. Nothing truly practical here. If you're just thinking about starting a magazine, this book gives a decent overview of how to think about and plan your idea. If you're already in the process of putting together your magazine, you need something different. I recommend ""How Not to Start a Magazine"" by B. Ann Bell."
5,"Should be titled the ""Bible of Start-Up Publishing""!","Starting & Running a Successful Newsletter or Magazine should be on the desk or bookshelf of every would-be or early-stage publisher (maybe seasoned professionals as well)! I have read a number of other books on this subject and, from my point of view, Cheryl Woodard's thoughtful, direct and insightful work is easily the best I have come across.Not only is her past experience in starting 3 successful magazines clearly on display here, but Ms. Woodard has continued to bring the book up-to-date with the latest trends for introducing a newsletter or magazine to the market and managing the publication after introduction. In addition, she has assembled a list of contacts and other important information that will be an immediate benefit to any new publisher.This book will stay close at hand for me as a resource and problem reference!"
3,Murder,"I found it interesting to enter the world of interlibrary loans in 1940s England. The process of making a photostat seems almost as complicated as developing print photographs! Another aspect common to the time period is smoking! Everyone, I mean everyone, is always longing to smoke a cigarette, and all complain bitterly about the office rule making it verboten. Even Barbara, the educated and charming main character, can be seen lighting up from time to time. Perhaps she isn't so bright after all, though, as she dumps her kind, thoughtful fiance in order to maintain her mad crush on Mark Allan, believed by most to have committed ""Dewey Death."" Did he kill the odious Mrs. Warren? Was it someone else? I will not divulge the answer here."
5,Essential reading for anyone seeking self improvement,"A real eye opener. I read this book thinking it had something to do with posture as I suffer with backache from sitting in front of a computer all day. I was wrong. This is about a new way of living your life by releasing the tensions, both physical and mental that we have accumulated throughout our lives. The amazing thing is that you don't have to do anything, rather learn to undo. This book is also very easy to read, in a nice relaxed style, which makes it easy to understand and put into practice."
2,"GREAT SINGING, MEDIOCRE OPERA","FIRST, THIS RE-ISSUE BRINGS NO LIBRETTO AND SCANT NOTES. THE PRINCIPALS ARE WELL ESTABLISHED STARS, WHICH DOES NOT REALLY MEAN THEY ARE EXPERTS ON THE SINGING OF VERISMO. THEREFORE, THEY SOUND LIKE THEIR USUAL PHENOMENAL SELVES: TECHNIQUE BUT NO . . . FEELING. OR PERHAPS IT MAY BE THAT THIS OPERA ITSELF IS NOT TRANSCENDENTAL, IT DOES NOT MOVE THE LISTENER TO IDENTIFY WITH IT. THE STORY OF A TYPHOID MARY RUSSIAN PRINCESS WHO COMMITS SUICIDE WHEN HER LOVER DOES NOT FORGIVE HER (BUT, YES, HE DOES, TOO LATE)FOR WIPING OUT HIS FAMILY, HAS NONE OF THE UNIVERSAL THEMES A WORK OF ART MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. THIS ONE DOES BECAUSE OF THE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. BUT IT DOES NOT BEAR A SECOND LISTENING."
5,great vampire story/show,So far this is the last of the series released officialy. (although you can find bootlegs of the rest of the series on dvd on ebay but not as great pic/aud quality as official) After enjoying the last two vampire high dvds i loved this one just the same. When it was over I was begging for more to be released. It was so great and i couldn't stand not seeing the rest of the show. It only aired/aires in canada and the UK. luckily a friend of mine was doing a summer internship in the UK and he recorded the rest of the show for me. Hopefully the entire show will come out so all it's fans can see. so buy these with the other dvds and you wont regret it. It lasted only one season but it wasnt enough for me or it's other fans around he world.
2,Informative but challenging read,"The authors no doubt had good intentions, but didn't execute well. There was no one on this team of writers who was fluent in English, which makes the going tough at times. While there is information here which the hardcore student will find worthwhile, be warned that it is a challenging read nonetheless. The writers also wrote from the viewpoint of the Chinese Communist government, with occasional disparagements of Western governments and their policies in China thrown in. Add to this the frequent reference to various Chinese dynasties without background explanation or approximate years, and you have a challenging book with mostly accurate information written by a committee for committees. I'm not a committee."
4,The name of the studio says it all,"Yes, from a studio named ""Cheezy Flicks""...very appropriate. This movie is, among many things, one of those cheapies you use to catch on late-night fright fests back in the day before all-night infomercials took over (staying up late has never been fun since). It's got everything needed to qualify as a bonafide, deep-fried cheesy classic: Cheap production, very flimsy plot, laughable action scenes, dialogue, and make-up effects, and over-the-top background music. Perfect.The transfer and sound are good. Among the few extras, I did enjoy the short collection of ""Intermission"" snips that look like were taken from old drive-in shorts from the 50s and 60s. Nice touch."
3,Understated,"Very good, understated novel. If you're looking gor High Drama like ""The end of Alice"" then you are going to be dissapointed. This short novel is more studies the disfunctional relationship between two very unstable women by avoiding the obvious cliches'I wanted to find out more but I understood why the author ended the story at the point. It's because the story was more about the dynamic between the women and not the affect of their relationship. Both women especially the patient were terribly disturbed even before they met."
5,Great book,"I loved this book. I thought the characters were very convincing and the relationship between therapist and patient was very real. The ending was a little weaker than the rest of the book but I was captivated. A true psychological thriller, intelligent, disturbing, unpredictable yet very convincing."
3,"Interesting premise, but left me somewhat empty.","This was my first A.M. Homes book. I liked it enough to read her other work. The premise is an intriguing one: a therapist becomes convinced that her patient is her lost daughter given up for adoption about 23 years before. I found myself confused by the characters actions though.First of all, Jody seemed like a reasonably well adjusted young woman, despite the fact she was nervous to go on to college (I think that's a natural reaction). Second, I can't understand her mental collapse, and why she begins toward the end to distrust Claire. I think Jody begins to question Claire's professionality too late. Additionally, Jody's antagonism toward her mother is not well explained.Despite these criticisms, I liked the characters, and I was interested in the idea of the therapist convincing herself of something with little but circumstantial evidence. The story of a therapist slowly becoming unwound is the intriguing one in this story."
3,"Kept my interest, but she's got better","I'm a big fan of A.M. Homes, and I love her other books. This was not as good. Intriguing, but what it lacks from her other books is that ability she has to make you scared of the characters and really feel like you know their deepest thoughts too intimately."
2,Read The End Of Alice instead,"I read this after The End Of Alice and I was disappointed. The characters seemed very one dimensional, their actions incomprehensible and the ending was very dull. I can't understand why this is called a thriller?? Nothing happened?? Literally nothing??? I don't need explosions and fireworks, but if this is supposed to be character based, the characters let the book down. I hate giving bad reviews, but I was disappointed in this book, The End Of Alice was pretty traumatic, but well written, read that instead."
5,It was his best book yet!,"This has to be the best book he has ever written! I really got into the book! It makes you wondering what is going to happen in the next chapter. And at the end, it even makes your heart beat faster! I loved it!"
4,Creative and Wonderful,"Unforgettable and expressive songwriting makes ""The Scarlet Letter"" come alive in a modern world. Composer Mark Governor is a major talent. Features Kathy Fisher (from group ""Fisher"") as Hester Pryne with her ""hot rock in velvet"" voice. Definitely one of the best musicals from the last few years."
4,Interesting and often beautiful...,"Last week I saw Mark Govenor perform some songs from his musical acoustically at Genghis Cohen in Los Angeles. The song, ""Naive"" will bring tears to your eyes! It's a beautiful meditation on deep loss. There are some strange moments in this musical, but also some gems worth purchasing it for!"
1,A for awful,"This is one of the worst musicals I ever listened to. It's Rocky Horror meets Jesus Christ Superstar turned bad. Some of the singers can't sing on key, the timing of coming in on some numbers is off and just plain annoying songs; Nothing that a few days later you can say stick and your mind."
1,Probably the worst performance I know for Mozart's Requiem,"Karajan, like Karajan, gives a well-polished performance, but lacking the slightest esprit. The singers are very good, the orchestra and the choir are well coordinated, but it all sounds like an army discipline. The military associations do not end up here: in fortissimo pieces (like the Dies Irae) Karajan, as always, exposes all his aggressiveness. He's not powerful, but violent. Even in pieces like the Lacrimosa it seems as though the choir sounds sad because someone gave them an order to sound sad.Leave Karajan in anything that needs an expression of true sentiment (in short: in anything having to do with music...). If you want a good performance of Mozart's requiem - turn to Barenboim's early recording."
1,Total brain fart,"I doubt that Edgar Allan Poe would want to put his name to this total piece of garbage. The film to DVD transfer was horrible and most of it was either fuzzy are hard to see. 15 minutes in I wanted to just shut it off but figured I at least needed to finish it to give it a fair review. I was wrong, 15 minutes would have been good enough, in short it never got any better.45 minutes into this dribble the reporter finally realized the nuts had taken over, talk about dim. One hour in there was a short orgy and throughout several T&A; shots even though it was fuzzy it helps take your mind off of this waste of time.I can only hope the director ""Juan Moctezuma"" needed money really bad to agree to make this so called film, if not I at least hope he hasn't butchered another film.Run far and fast away from this cinematic abortion and don't look back."
1,worked for a day,"i loved it for a day, because the arms quit working right away. sounded like the gears were stripped, so all we had was slight music or a grinding noise."
2,not good quality,we were excited to get this and our baby really liked it but less than 4 months after using it the branches have stopped moving and it makes a loud clicking noise. noticed another reviewer had the same problem. Very cute design but something doesn't work well when put together.
1,Choose another mobile...,"We were excited to get this mobile because of the different sounds - one setting plays nature type sounds and another plays music. Unfortunately, the ""branches"" get stuck and start to make loud clicking noises that scare my baby. :o( We're going to have to buy a different mobile."
2,Unsafe on certain cribs,"I recently purchased this item and was excited to use it. It was easy to put together however when I put it on the crib it was very heavy and with one slight bump it fell onto the crib. Luckily my daughter was not in the crib. If you have a crib that has thicker side rails this is not the mobile for you. I have a sleigh type crib and even thought it fits on it, it will definetly fall if touched even slightly. I am returning it today."
3,Fast-paced thriller,"This is a dandy adventure story. In the center of all the action is Gulf Stream, an offshore structure dedicated to research and ""green"" industry. Add a group of ecoterrorists determined to destroy it, a dedicated group of employees striving to save it from all enemies including economic difficulties, undercover agents, a hurricane, a bit of romance and a wayward octopus named Louis, and you have the setting for some interesting action. It has a nice mix of male and female characters, with Emma Took (who designed Gulf Stream) taking the lead. I had some difficulty sorting out all the characters at first. And despite the drawings of the Gulf Stream, I didn't always know where the action was taking place -- but that may just be me -- I never could read a blueprint. Overall a satisfying read which kept me from opening other books, and which would probably translate nicely into a film I would like to see."
4,Future Aventure,"Set in a future when the sea level has risen enough to cause a shortage of land, the story is set on a floating city off the east coast of the USA. Apart form that it is an adventure story.Lots of corporate self interest with murders and bombs. It is a good read, different from Jumper, the protagonists are older, and it rolls along quite nicely.GREENWAR: AN ENVIRONMENTAL THRILLER"
2,A good book for an airplane ride or overnight in a hotel,"Talk about misrepresentation! Tom Clancy is probably cringing at the use of his name in conjunction with this mildly written, some-what entertaining work. Totally predictable, with a dismail cliff-hanger (perhaps ""ditch-hopping"" is better) ending."
3,So-So,"Confession is a straight-up classic, without a doubt. If you consider yourself a fan of heavy rock and nu-metal, you should own 2 copies. One Nation Underground is basically just so-so. The second half is much stronger than the first, and although I'm all for experimentation, I would have liked to hear more of the catchy guitar melodies that were on Confession and less of the latin horns, salsa sounds ect.Ill Nino have since signed to indie label Cement Shoes, and they're working on album number 4 right now. Hopefully it'll be more like Confession and less like One Nation Underground"
2,What happened?,"This album was a total disappointment compared to their previous two albums. Most of the songs were just simply bland. The crunching riffs and melodies were not present in their latest installment. There were 3 alright songs, them being:This is warWhat you deserveViolent saintThe one song that I thought was actually pretty good was:All I ask forCome on Ill nino, songs like Rumba, Liar, God Save Us...... are works of art. Let's see that again!"
1,You Must Be Joking,"Grow out of this lyrically average nu-metal garbage. If you wan't some good Latin Metal get Puya's 3 albums: 'Puya' , 'Fundamental' and 'Union' (even though these albums are also of the ""nu"" variety of metal)."
4,Good but not great,"This is maybe a weaker album than Revolution/revolucion and Confessions but it has some good songs.This is more of a Bush bashing album because it deals often with racism and anti war which frankly is too late because Bush is President again and the war is still going on as we speak. The strongest is This is War which proves my point about bush Bashing which now is seems old since people unsuccessfully tried last year, I mean let it go people. The band seems to have downtuned their instruments and Cristian has lost some skill in his voice but it is still a strong album to get by."
4,top of the genre,"This third album from Ill nino is phenomenal! The only possible criticism to this album is that it could be longer, but I would rather have it shorter instead of having them put a bunch of filler songs in the mix that might not be as good. After a bit of a mellower second album they have come back with a punch you in the face album utilizing there own unique style and all the anger and intensity a great metal album needs. This makes three great albums in a row. These guys definitely are at the level of disturbed, godsmack, korn, etc. Anyone who says any different is just a metal snob who wants to pretend that music is more that it is, which is a personal expression. This is the first review I've ever written but i have read so many stupid reviews where people break down every song giving there detailed opinion and comparing each song to other bands and other songs, etc.. If you want an album you can blast and feel the emotion then buy this album"
4,Very nice!,"I really like this album. Ill Nino seemed to delve into their more melodic side in this one and it worked out nicely. This is war is probably my favorite track on the album. I like the way the intro blended into the song, which has tibal-like chanting and percussion. The only thing i didn't like so much was the tempo changed greatly from song to song which isn't such a bad thing, but it kind of takes me out of the ""trance"" that i like when listening to good music. I think most true music listeners will appreciate it. If you're looking for their more hardcore side you should probably get one of the first two albums.Good album but a little bit different."
3,Ill Nino - One Nation Underground,"To date, confession is still my favorite Ill Nino record. I've never been a huge fan of Ill nino to start with, but when Linkin Park became too poppy for my tastes, I needed something similar, but more hardcore. And well, Ill Nino was there to fill the void. As per custom with every nino record, the more melodic moments are the finest, followed closely by the nu-metal moments, and tainted slightly by a need to be 'metal' in moments (luckily) few and far beyond. Unlike Revolution, which had 'unreal', and Confession, which had 'unframed', One Nation Underground is without a standout track. 'All that I ask' for is ONU's finest moment, hands down, but still not quite worthy of standout status.All in all, fans of revolution and confession may or may not be pleased with Ill Nino's evolution towards the melodic. The new sound is really hit or miss, and for me, it was a little bit of both.Recommended with caution."
4,"Good book, good professor","If you are taking Baker for Constitutional Law this is a must have. Read it before you semester starts, and throughout."
5,Better than my entire semester of Con Law,"This is a great read, very well-written in a style that is concise, humorous, and EXTREMELY valuable for learning. I was intimidated by its size at first (a bit bigger than most supplemental books for law school) but I truly zipped through this book. The authors did a great job with pacing the information, as well as injecting some personality and insight into what otherwise might be very dry material.Bottom line: I learned more by reading this book over a couple of days than I did from an entire semester of Con Law. If you find your Con Law professor/class/casebook boring or confusing, look no further. This book will actually do the subject justice and make it interesting and engaging. Not only did I feel much more prepared for my exam, but I feel like a more well-rounded person for having a much better understanding of the topics within. Highly, highly recommended!"
4,Not for you if you want outlines!!,"This is like another textbook. If you are looking for a supplement to compliment the material, it is a very in depth examination of critical constitutional areas. It is not a book of case briefs."
5,Great refill,"I purchased this refill for a Lamy rollerball pen that had been sitting unused for several years. Was so glad to find the refills on line at Amazon. This refill writes smoothly, no skips, doesn't scratch the paper as you write, flows nicely."
5,Superb!,"I don't do too much writing these days and when I do use a fountain pen - a pretty good one at that. I had a Lamy lying around for years that (unsurprisingly) needed a refill. So ordered, arrived on time, and what a revelation. This refill is so good - a dream and clearly the finest of writing experiences. I'll stop while I'm on a roll :)"
4,Lamy M66,"The beauty of this product is the ease with which the pen traverses most paper stocks with a smooth output of ink, and a lack of ""blotchiness"". I have found that the pen does not have a particularly long life-span after opening the sealed packages in which it is delivered. Ball-point pens have lasted much longer in my hands. But the thing that keeps me coming back is the ability to use the pen so as to give a script that simulates the use of a fountain pen. I have not worked out how this happens, or how I achieve this result, but it does give character to writing that one does not get with a ball-point."
5,Realistic black bear,"This stuffed bear is a nice, very soft realistic looking black bear. it is well worth the cost. I would recommend it for people of all ages."
2,why this book is so expensive here?,"I've been following the author for some time now on youtube, he is also known as BASHAR and to me he is a genius, the book is probably as good or better than the other reviews say it is, but i was trying the get mi hands on a copy when i realize that on BASHAR's website this book is worth 22.95 new, i'm i missing something here?. The reason i give it otwo stars is for the price only, the product i bet is as good as five stars."
5,Very interesting biblical truth about animals.,"After reading this book no one could ever truly believe animals will not be in heaven. I never realized the bible tells so much about the animal kingdom.The scriptures in this book pertaining to animals is almost unbelievable. The scriptures are straight from the bible exactly as written. The author explains the scriptures as to their true meaning. I can't understand how a minister could say animals have no soul or Holy Spirit, and could never enter into heaven. This book clearly reveals many scriptures telling us animals do have a soul and spirit, and they will go to heaven. The book even explains why the animals are to be resurrected at the coming of Christ.I will never be convinced by anyone that the bible tells nothing about animals going to heaven. I know according to God's word I will see my animals again if I am fortunate enough to go to heaven."
1,100% Failure,"I purchased two of this item, for a total of four space-bags. I used them according to the instructions, putting less into them than the commercials indicate. Within days, all four had leaked - not one kept the air out."
1,DO not buy these bags,"The zipper seal mechanism was very hard to pull through and actually ripped one of the bags on the first use. Worse, the ones that did allow the zipper mechanism to pull closed did not form a lasting vacuum seal."
1,none stay deflated,"I have BOXES of these things. So far, NOT ONE has stayed deflated. They do keep the water out, but as a space saver, they don't work. I think the valves are not sealed well, and so the air gets back in within a day or two."
1,Would not buy again from this manuracturer,The products did not maintain their vacuumed size. Each different bag I used returned to the natural size of the materials I put in and I followed the instructions exactly. I would not use the product again nor recommend the product to anyone else.Catherine Gallagher
4,awesome,I love space bags. Medium is the perfect size for about a drawer worth of clothes. I will definately buy again.
1,Cheap product! Falls apart after a couple of uses. Zip seal is very weak.,"We have had these space bags for a year. The zipper is cheap and does not seal well, the plastic on the vacuum nozzle comes off readily, and the plastic gets brittle and tears easily. Take it from a year of experience; this brand of vacuum bags has been nothing but bad news."
2,50/50 chance of these working,"I bought a 2 pack of the medium space bags. I opened the package and noticed that the bags were pretty tiny. I'd say the smallest useful size bag would probably be a large, because honestly, I think 1 small womens size fleece hoodie would have maxed out my medium bag. Anyway, upon stuffing the bags (and I use the word stuffing very loosely), one of my 2 bags ripped. So that's 1 down and 1 to go. I had to suck the air out of the remaining bag twice before it stayed out, and I promptly shoved the ""thin"" -- but extremely lumpy -- bag into my closet, closed the door, and haven't spoke of it since. I think space bag needs to do a makeover and use some thinner plastic -- at least the thickness of a freezer bag rather than a sandwich baggie."
1,Don't waste your money,"This product is not worth buying. The idea is good, but the bags are terrible. We bought several, but only one maintains the vacuum seal. One bag tore right under the ziplock line. Very disappointed with this product. It did not perform as advertised."
2,Space Bags,"I purchased several different sizes of the space bags. They do decrease the size of space used to store items. However, I was extremely surprised when the seal was vacuumed up into my vacuum cleaner hose, making the space bag a giant zip lock bag, without making the volume smaller. Not only that, my vacuum cleaner hose is now useless and has to be brought in to be repaired because it seems that the seal's diameter must be very close to the diameter of the vacuum cleaner hose! Amazon did replace the product, but I will be out of pocket for the repair of the hose and the fact that I can't use my vacuum cleaner until I get the hose repaired."
2,You get what you pay for.,Stitching near handle shredded in a couple of weeks. I'll need to re-stitch it myself. Spend the extra $10 or $15 for a higher quality product.
4,good history of cattleyas,"This is a fine book for lovers of orchids. It is, first and foremost, a history, even though there are rudimentary chapters on botany and culture. Cattleyas began the orchid-mania that swept Europe and this book charts that passion and the subsequent struggles to cultivate, progagate and hybridize. The classic cattleyas are described in great detail -- including brief cultural advice for the grower."
5,Cattleyas,"This book is also a must for every serious orchid lover. Good in detail, Word and photo as well. A recommendation for sure."
3,Not complete,"While the overall recording is quite good, the ballet at the beginning of the fourth act is missing. Unfortunately, this segment contains some absolutely glorious writing from Massenet. It's a shame that the producers chose to cut it, but it was most likely to save valuable recording space since this was originally recorded in 1978, and would have been limited by the normal playing time of the LP."
5,SO GOOD,I absolutely loved this recording. Fredericka Von Stade is absolutely incredible. Massenet's Cendrillon is absolutely delightful. I highly recommend this recording.
2,did not get book pictured,"I got book different from pictured oneI prefer older Riverside Edition cover, not thenewer one you sent me which is not the one picturedI'm disappointed, really"
4,These are the Original Songs Remastered - Beware of Fakes,"I could not believe how many rip-off versions of 60s music there are out there. This is the real original recordings remastered so they have a much better sound but are still the same songs you remember hearing if you are as old as me :) There were a few songs that I was not that crazy about but obviously that will depend on the listener. Just be confident that THIS is the one you want if you are looking for the best recordings of the originals. I noticed that unless you buy the whole CD you don't get that little ""Amazon Verified Purchase' , I only bought 5 of the songs."
5,Great Blast from the Past,"After having attended a Gary Lewis concert for Valentine's Day, I had to get the CD. This one is well worth the price. It has all of his best on there, some remastered. And without the scratches!"
3,A Better Selection of Songs here,"Well we go from 2 stars on one greatest hits album to 3 stars here. There was also a wider selection, but here we have some more goodies. The best being ""Autumn"" It has the Beatles flavor, well practically the same chords as the song ""Help"" anyway, but it also shows some other good stuff like ""I Don't Wanna Say Goodnight"", and ""Doin The Flake""; a rather hokey dance song, but it's actually alright. Sometimes you just have to dig deep to find gems I guess."
4,Legendary Master Series - Gary Lewis & the Playboys,"When I was young, they was one of my favourite band.Now when I ear Gary Lewis I remember my best moments of my life."
5,The Best of the Best,"This is the best sounding and most complete Greatest Hits package for Gary Lewis and the Playboys. An unedited ""Miss Go Go"" and a longer version of ""My Heart's Symphony"" is included, as are rarities ""Doin' The Flake,"" ""Way Way Out,"" and ""I Don't Wanna Say Goodnight."" Some of the studio banter before several songs is a nice addition too. Most of the songs feature Gary's best line up: John West-Keyboards, Carl Radle on bass (who later played bass for Eric Clapton for 8 years), Tom Tripplehorn on lead guitar, and Jimmy Karstein on drums. Great arrangements by Leon Russell. This is just good, clean, harmless 60's pop music."
4,Sad but true.,"""Some Mother's Son"" is yet another in a long list of films dealing with the strife in Ireland. This film is a thought provoking look into the world of the Irish Hunger Strike. Based around the activities of two IRA members who get captured and jailed. They fight for PoW status and begin a hunger strike to win support. One of the strikers (Bobby Sands) is elected to the British Parliament and their hopes are raised only to be dashed by Maggie Thatcher.If you are into political, humanitarian or real life films, this film is for you."
1,I've had Lights Of America explode in the socket.,I've owned a few Lights Of America Model 2920. Not one of them has lasted over a year and the most recent BLEW UP in the fixture. I will be pulling any more I own out and disposing of them properly. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Excellent reissue,"This reissue of ""Tonight's Decision"" is certainly worthy. Instead of some bogus bonus tracks that many bands include on reissues, Katatonia has chosen two previously unreleased tracks that are as strong and powerful as others on the album. This album is a _MUST_ for those into high quality dark and beautiful music."
3,Xena with sex,"Part of the Jalav series. Jalav is a warrior queen like Xena on TV, that periodically finds herself captured and forced to be a sex slave"
2,What happened to the theme music on the China Beach CD?,"I loved the China Beach series, and I watch it every time it is on TV. I loved the theme music. The show always ended with it, and it would play at certain times during the show. The CD has NO theme music. That was the only reason I bought the China Beach CD. John Sacret Young and Artie Ripp made a big mistake by not having a lot of the theme music on the CD. The only thing that half-way saves the CD is Dana Delaney's song, ""Far from Home"". I am now waiting for the series to come out on DVD just so I can hear the theme music!!"
5,My favorite time period music..,Best music ever written during this time period I loved the music and the series. Wish it were on dvd.
2,Very frustrating,"I had no prior knowledge of Swahili and found this program very frustrating. No English is used to explain what the Swahili sentences mean, only pictures. In every unit there were 4 or 5 words that I could not figure out simply from the pictures. Also, know instrcution is given about the grammer. I would realize that something is being conjugated, but could not figure out why.Over all, I was very frustrated."
3,I miss the old crew...,"I was excited about the idea of a riffed martial arts flick, but I found myself paying more attention to the movie than the comments. It was all kinda boring. It didn't have the chemistry like things used to with Mike and Kevin."
5,Learn Autodesk Inventor in a day,"This book provides a holistic view on using Autodesk Inventor in real-world application. You will learn various key concepts such as parametric solid modeling, assembly modeling, sheet metal modeling, and engineering drafting, and all the advanced techniques in modeling. Accompanying this book is a CD with which you learn using Autodesk Inventor right-away. If you are a college student or a K12 student, you are elligible to purchase Inventor at a very low student price."
4,Good Book - could be used in small groups,"If you have ever gone through the OSL training classes for healing, or even just a good study of the healings of Jesus, you know there is still need for Christians to discuss the particuliars of ""how"" and ""when,"" etc. This book answers many of these questions, although I have just finished a new book by Tiffany Snow ""The Power of Divine"" that goes one step better. Nevertheless, this ""Hunger"" book has points in it that the new Christian healer may need to familiarize with before stepping out in faith to work with God."
2,"Overrated, only for die hard fans","I paid a fairly high price to obtain this book based on its reputation and one of the best Marilyn books out there. It's not.I was very disappointed to see that 95% was just scans of Italian magazine covers from the 1950s. Very few pictures other than that. Really, who wants a book showing muddy scans of 50 year old magazines from Italy? The images are just not good. The last section of 20 pages or so reprints some well know Sam Shaw and Milton Greene images that are in other books. Don't waste too much money on this, unless you have to have everything about Marilyn."
5,"Marilyn, The Life The Myth and Just Wonderful!",I got this book today and i am just over the moon about it! I have been wanting this rare book for so long and it is choke full of photos and magazine covers that i haven't seen and i am just devouring it! For any Marilyn Fan such as myself you won't be disappointed at all! A great treasure to own! so grab a drink sit back and enjoy!
5,Intellectual Giants Stand Alone,"I strongly second Mcgaffney's review of Mccanney's book.James Mccanney stands alone against the entire received wisdomof mainstream astronomy. Mccanney has self-published his theoryin 4 books(...)James Mccanney, Immanuel Velikovsky and Zecharia Sitchen presentthe most compelling scientific viewpoints I have encounteredsince Dr. Myron Evans' Grand Unified field theory(...)They have transformed astronomy for mefrom a dull subject to a consuming interest."
3,Voyeur's Tenderness,"This is, not surprisingly perhaps, yet another voyeur/flaneur version of exoticism. Canetti in this small book observes, intrudes, comments, walks, speaks French, gets frequently, guiltily and somewhat embarassingly excited by all the women he sees... and employs the gestures of a sympathetic, lonely walker who is trying to behave properly in a foreign country. He is sensitive when it comes to animals; when it comes to people, he sympathises with the paralysed, the crippled, the weak in the head. Somehow, through all this poeticised tenderness - and Canetti's writing (if not his life) is markedly tender - the reader may feel the writing is stifled and Marrakesh is presented as the city of the maimed. The vignettes are evocative and beautifully crafted all right, but there is something disquieting in the account."
4,Still true to current Marrakesh,"Even though this book is several decades old, its contents remain true to current Marrakesh. A sharply observed portrait, with each vignette, no matter how short, illuminating an aspect of this fascinatingly diverse and vibrant city and culture. The biggest change between Canetti's time and now, and the only ""voice"" of current Marrakesh absent from this book, is that of the tourist. But even in today's touristy Marrakesh, none of the voices Canetti describes are hidden or difficult to find. A lovely introduction to a lovely city."
4,Don't Question,"This is one of my favorite Palmer cd's. I needed to come to it's defense, some peoples mixed bags are other peoples diversity's. I can understand why someone would be dissappointed with this but you will warm up to it. I love the Steve Stevens guitar work and the ending songs are simply great. If you are into artists who can touch all bases and are willing to open your mind you will love this cd."
2,picture does not match actual item,I looked around internet to find a good priced rasta color guitar strap. So I finally found this one that I liked because it had the black strips at the ends. turns out to be that there is no black in the strap just yello green and red. Picture is wrong and item does not look as good without the black strips at the ends.
4,Colour is not what I expected,"I ordered the rasta strap expecting to get the one in the picture. The one I received is not the one in the picture. The colors are much brighter, and though they are red green and yellow, they look like a clown strap or something. The red is so bright it almost looks pink.The actual quality of the strap is decent though."
3,Hat Light,"It works ok, I found that the Battery didnt last as long as I had hoped. Not made as sturdy as I would have wanted."
5,Like these.,I have only had these for a little while but I love them. I have had no problems getting ingredients out and I have been hand washing and have had no problems with the numbers. They are sturdy and they include the extra sizes which is very helpful!
3,NOT dishwasher safe,"These are great measuring cups, exactly what I was looking for. The handles are sturdy and do not look like they will break any time soon. I LOVE the shape! Great for dipping into jars and bags. The measuring markings are molded into the plastic and will not rub or wear off. The one con is that the 1 cup melted the first time I put it in the dishwasher. I placed it on the top rack, but it still melted. Not completely, but enough to change the shape of the cup, and thus its measuring accuracy. Ugh. Hopefully they will send me a new one."
3,okay but not noteworthy,"What can I say, they are measuring cups. Nothing spectacular to note about them.So basically here are the pros and cons as I see them.pros:The more pointed scoop is nice as opposed to the normal round ones.The variety of sizes is good.The handles are comfortable.cons:They are more bulky than my other plastic measuring cups.Residue tends to stick in them, requring a wipe down wash rather than a quick rinse.Bottom line, they are not my preferred measuring cups but they work."
2,Disappointing,"I thought these measuring cups were going to be great to have, since they include the 2/3 cup and 3/4 cup ""extras"" that come in so handy. However, I have found two things I don't like about them: 1) ingredients don't release well from the texture of these cups, for some reason, and 2) the measuring cups I own are black (I assume these are the same, although there is currently no photo on this site) and started out with brightly colored dots on the handles with the ""1"" or ""1/2"" inside them. After only having them a few months, the dot on the 1 C. measure has completely worn off and a couple of others are showing wear. These have always been washed by hand, too. This is particularly inconvenient because the 2/3 and 3/4 cups make it much harder to distinguish by size just by looking at them. Someone needs to go back to design and start over."
5,Found them to be very good,I bought these in a department store a couple of years ago and I have not had any of the problems the other people are talking about. The numbers are still all there after 2 years of use. I've even had them fall to the very bottom of my dishwasher during the cycle and still the numbers are firmly attached. The ingredients have always come out just fine for me. Most importantly I love the variety of sizes included. In fact I am planning on getting a second set to help on those days that I do a lot of baking at once. I even went out and bought the matching measuring spoons.
1,"Nice grip, but otherwise junk","The rubber grips are nice, but as others have noted, the capacity circles (painted on) starts flaking off pretty quickly. Also, they are relatively shallow, so it makes it hard to get an accurate measure. If you don't want to dirty up several of them (for example, you need 1-1/2 cups worth), the shallowness makes it difficult to ""eyeball"" a half cup. I found I used an older, cheaper, taller set that I bought 20 years ago (for $1) more often. They also don't have a good pouring lip like on some others. With the paint flaking off, they look ratty. I can't remember if I threw them out or donated them."
1,They are ok BUT...,I originally decided to buy these OXO measuring cups because the price was reasonable and it has more cups then normal. At first I thought the extra cups were nice even though they are not really necessary.I've had them less than a month and already the numbers are coming off. LESS THAN A MONTH! I've come to realize the extra cups are actually a liability because they are hard to tell apart without the numbers on them. I would not buy these again. I feel like I've wasted my money. I should have just spent more money on cups with etched numbers on them.
1,Great if you're not into exact measurements,"These measuring cups are very comfortable to use but the measurements washed off after about 3 cycles in the dishwasher. Now I have to guess at which measurement the cup is by eyeballing the size, which is not as much fun as it sounds. The actual cup portion has held up well. If the numbers were etched into the cups this would make this product worth buying. Oh, and the 7th piece (the egg separater) should be named the ""yolk breaker"" as it does not work at all, ever."
2,Missing numberfs,"I love OXO products but not these measuring cups. Same issue as others - the numbers vanish quickly. It's easy to always find the 1 cup measure, but when you want to quickly pull out the cups and know that you've grabbed the 1/3 cp measure vs. the 1/4 cup measure, you can't do it. I'm looking for more durable ones right now, which is how I stumbled across these again."
2,Clumsy,"I find these very clumsy to use.I weigh my dry ingredients and just use these for an initial guage, so I can't comment on accuracy, but even if they were perfect, I would prefer a metal set."
2,"Cheap cups, label wears off quickly.","These are cheap quality cups at not so cheap price. First, the plastic ring that holds the cups together is extremely flimsy and can easily break. But my biggest complaint is that the labels will quickly wash off even if you hand wash them! After a while, it becomes difficult to tell what is what in regards to size. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. This is not the first time I have been disappointed by an Oxo product but it will be my last."
3,Good measuring cups,"These things are fantastic. The bowls are even with the handles, which means that dip-and-sweep measuring works great with these. The egg separator is kinda gimmicky since I generally just use my fingers to separate eggs. They feel very sturdy, and the grips feel rubberized which gives a really nice secure feeling when you're holding them.*** EDIT 11/4/2009***Downgraded my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. The size markers have worn off of 3 of the cups. It's pretty easy to distinguish them still since I know which is which, but if someone who wasn't familiar with the set (guests or friends) and the fact that it has a 2/3 & 3/4 cup measure would probably find it confusing."
5,OXO Does it again!,"I can always rely on innovative products from this company! Perfectly balanced and shaped measuring cups--it even includes a 2/3 measure which I've never seen before. Durable enough, I can even throw them in the dishwasher without fear of fading colors or melting. A beautiful set."
1,Disapointing,"The markings on the measuring cups washed off, only washed by hand. I also purchased measuring spoons same result. Company said to mail back not worth postage. Won't buy oxo again."
4,Accurate and durable,"Extra sets of measuring spoons and cups are always welcome as the markings on old ones eventually fade, chip or the spoons/cups are misplaced altogether.These OXO ones have raised markings printed in red on the handle and seem to be wear resistant. They survived the top rack dishwasher and even once being accidentally put in the cutlery basket. Only time will tell if they are truly durable due to the placement of the markings (where your thumb would usually be on the handle).In this reissued ""new"" version of these cups, the markings don't rub off immediately, however it is still recommended to buy these from a place with a good return policy in case you accidentally get one of the older defective ones.The measurements seem accurate enough and were compared by weight equivalent on 2 scales, a digital Salter glass model, and an old brass balance-weight model."
4,Plastic Measuring cups,"Oxo is a safe choice for good products at reasonable prices and that's true of these cups. There are six in the set so pretty much all of the sizes you might need are covered. The shape is elongated instead of round, so they may be an easier fit into some canisters than round measures. The sizes are marked in different colors on raised lettering, so even if the paint wears off, you should still be able to read the sizes.Because these measures are plastic and not metal, some powdered ingredients seem to slightly stick to them, and oil is a bit harder to clean off. They are also a little bit bulky compared to metal measuring cups. That's why I am only giving them four stars."
2,Measurements wear off,"I have these cups in black. I have had them for a long time and I only wash them by hand. Within the first 3 months the measurement dots began to wear off. I used my husband's modeling paint to paint the numbers back onto all of the cups and the modeling paint has lasted longer than the original measurements! The sizes of the cups are perfect for baking, however given the poor quality of the size dots, I would look to another product."
2,guess the cup size,"I received these as a gift last Christmas & have had the same issues as everyone else...the numbers quickly wear off. (Hand washed only) and because of the extra cups, the sizes are so similar it is difficult to distinguish the cup size. Also, ingredients don't ""release"" well from the cups. Even dry ingredients such as sugar & flour will often stick to the insides of the cups. The soft plastic can also make them difficult to clean, especially if you've used butter or shortening. I'm on a search for a stainless steel measuring cup with the measurements stamped into them to avoid these issues in the future.On the plus side, the egg separator works really well!"
4,Great Measuring Cups,"These measuring cups are great because they are elongated and fit more easily into a cannister or container. I always like OXO products. Only reason I am giving this four stars is because I've realized that I don't really care for ""black"" measuring cups because it's hard to see if all your ingredients come out when dumping them into the bowl."
2,Disappointed,"I really liked the look of this set, however like others have said the stickers that tell you what size it is came off after just a few washes. I agree they should be part of the mold like my old Tupperware set which I'm now reaching for instead of these. These will be going to Goodwill."
5,Techno Club 11 stands the test of time,"This album might be five years old now but its stood the test of time, possibly one of the most atmospheric mixes out there. Just the first cd from Talla makes it worth buying.From Jay Frog's stunning mix of Nexus Point via French Kiss to the trance classic Ahmea there isnt a lame track on the whole cd.Add to that Pulsedriver's contribution on cd 2 and you have a winner.Like the classic days of Tunnel Trance Force? then you will love this."
3,could have been better,"Recently I have bought several cds of old arias: this is probably the only one among them stylistically completely in order, probably due to the undoubtful mastery of Mr Matteuzzi (and to the competence of the producer).His voice is not particularly beautiful nor sensual, some of his high notes sound decidedly unappealing.He chosed to include some British arias, which is not a bad idea per se but would have required a whole anthology and a better pronunciation.The orchestration sounds rather heavy and woodden"
2,generic,i was looking for the smell the fragrance by dead flowers but picked this up instead. may not be the same band. this was generic and run of the mill rock. life is too short to listen to music like this.
4,Not a great production... just good.,"I am from Greece, age 33.I bought this DVD in January 2009. I own the two DVDs of ""Celtic Woman"". I really like Chloe in ""Celtic Woman"" but I didn't like her that much in ""Walking in the Air"". I like 50% of the video clips in this DVD. If you are a celtic fan buy it; you will love the flute melody. If you want to find out about celtic music buy the ""Celtic Woman"" DVDs, otherwise this DVD won't reveal the magic of celtic music to you."
3,"Songs are good, videos are bad","Songs are very good (as expected, 4-5 star), music is OK (3-4 star), the videos are so boring (no star)."
3,Touring with Chloe,"I love the voice of this young lady from Ireland...the scenery of this country is lovely but I prefer Chloe's performances in front of live audiences rather than just walking around Ireland. To see her at her finest, watch the concerts of CELTIC WOMAN instead."
5,Walking in the Air,"A voice that will go far ... she is using her talents and learning while she is singing. She is a light hearted spirit seems to enjoy what she is doing. Musically, she can still develope since she isn't totally an adult yet."
5,Great DVD,I really enjoyed the CD of Chloe's Walking In The Air & the DVD was even better. I enjoy the scenes arounbd Ireland. Chloe has such a clear & beautiful voice.
3,1 yr post purchase,"This product was perfect when i firt received it.. and for a year i have used it for my 37' flat screen, cable modem, wireless router, ps2, and dvd player.. but about a month ago i started having issues with my router and modem. Eventually i went to check the connections and i found that the AC adapter for bother were FRIED!.. whether it was Both sets of equipment or the surge protect i'm unsure of. but i would say pay the few extra bucks and get a different one. what a shame."
4,"Interesting book, a good read","I bought this book for my 15 year old son, who has been learning about julius caeser in history class and is impressed by his strategic and logistic mind. He liked the book very much, says it was informative and very interesting . He has recommended it."
5,Citre Shine racle Fresh Fusion Colour Prism,I wish that Citre Shine would bring back their product line! This was my favorite brand at one time and was glad to get it through Amazon. I have fine hair that is subjected to the dry air of AZ which is hard on it and this conditioner works very well.
5,It Delivers,"This e-book delivers exactly what it promises in an organized, no-nonsense manner. Great essays. Great organization. Great value."
1,"Hilarious, Another English teacher Premed advisor Hoax","Poor quality essays yet this is too funny to be true, the author has no medical education and no medical school experience. Her self incorporated company also sells astrology charts at oseonline.One of her books selling on Amazon is titled ""A Common Sense Entrepreneurial Guide: How to Open & Run a Successful Consignment Shop"". My advice, please do not profit from poor pre med students."
1,"Do some research, Don't get Robbed!!!","This is a very interesting writer, the same writer ""Nancy L. Nolan"" publishes twenty other products which range from ""How to write consumer credit complaints"" to ""How to write letters in unusual business situations"". It is very unlikely that this writer ever went to an Ivy league medical school. The quality of these essays range from bad to mediocre. Her company, magnificent milestones, even publishes ""custom astrology charts"", I will not risk my future on these essays!"
3,Necessary Release?,"This has been my introduction to Mississippi JH, and for that matter, the only recording of his I've heard. I can only imagine, however, that there are better CDs of this man out there. Oodles of reverb soak every song, which gets irritating at first. Also, the packaging is not particularly attractive. Otherwise, the music and performances are great. I just don't know that you need this partiuclar CD."
5,"FULL OF LUST, ENVY AND DECEIT. A KEEPER!","Lovely Aubrey Blue disguises herself as a dowdy schoolteacher on her way to Santa Fe to exact revenge on Maxwell Fleming, the man who killed her family. This is not an easy task, since he's the town's richest citizen. On the way, she encounters handsome, embittered Christian McBride and his half-brother Sun Shadow. Christian also has a vendetta against Maxwell, since the man had him inprisoned for five years for a crime he didn't commit. This story was action-packed from the first page. I found myself wondering when Christian and the other supporting characters were going to see through Aubrey's disguise. The heat between Aubrey and Christian was intense, and I felt that I was right there with them. I really like Western romances, and this one had it all, guns blazing, saloons, gambling, you name it. I wish Canham would write a sequel or at least another Western romance."
4,Under the Desert Moon,"Although this book was quite good, and very readable with fine characterization, it isn't Ms. Canham's best work. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed, ""Under the Desert Moon"", it's plot tension and interesting characters. I have no reservation recommending this novel to any fan of the romance novel!"
4,a good plot,"The book started out great and then slowed down and then picked back up. There were a couple chapters where I wasn't sure if I would continue to the end. I did, though, and it turned out to be a great book. Highly enjoyable."
3,Not Canham's best effort,MC is a wonderful author and I've enjoyed many of her other books. This one was disappointing. Struggled to give it a 3...sorry mc.
1,Not a useful book -- two thumbs down!,"Not a useful book at all.Author blames the victim for acting like one, and suggests impractical, useless advice such as walking away (hard to do when someone is pinning you down and beating the you-know-what out of you) telling a teacher or other adult (most will do little or nothing) offering to tutor the bully in math, etc.He also expresses too much sympathy for the bully who feels inferior, etc.Widens the definition of bullying so much he trivializes it. For example, claims that TV commercials are a form of bullying because they try to persuade you to buy something. HUGE difference between that and someone beating you, spitting on you, calling you names etc.He also ""tries"" to help bullies basically by telling them to be nice, cooperative with others etc. which is naive and useless."
2,Why is Everybody Picking on Me,My son was required to read this book for his karate class. The book has some good ideas on handling bullies but some of the ideas are about lying your way out of a problem. It also seems that the author is misleading the public when he calls himself a doctor. His degree is in public health and not psychology as we are lead to beleive. I don't agree with lying and therefore can not recommend that other children read this.I also took this issue up with my son's karate teacher who tried to gloss over the issue. I know bullying is a problem but there are other books out there that are more honest and straight forward about the subject matter
1,"""Dad, this book tells you to lie!""","There are some useful insights in this book. The back cover says it aims to help young people learn that fighting is not an honorable solution to conflict. However, as my 12-year old daughter was reading the sub-section titled ""Trickery"" she looked at me with disbelief, and said, ""Dad, this book tells you to lie!""My 10-year old son replied, ""Well, what are you reading it for, then?""My kids grasped a point that the author seems to avoid: lying is also dishonorable, even to those who threaten us. This book lost its credibility with my kids right there. It is published in the ""Education for Peace Series"". How unfortunate! Peace cannot be bought at the price of integrity."
3,Not the best I Musici Four Seasons - try the digital version,"Listening to the track samples is easy to know that this CD is one of the old Four Seansons recorded in ADD by this great ensemble. I particulary suggest you to change your mind buying instead the same recording piece (except the L'estro Armonico), recorded by the same team on digital format.The recording was made far back in 1982 but is much more clear and Pina Carmirelli (the violin soloist) and the crew put's far more blood and tension than this old one.The CD is avaiable in Amazon.com on:http://www.amazon.com/Vivaldi-Quattro-Stagioni-Four-Seasons/dp/B0000040VO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s;=music&qid;=1294421953&sr;=8-2This is my sincerelly advice."
2,not reliable bags,"These space bags work to some degree, but are not reliable. They frequently leak air. The concept is great, but these are not well made."
1,ITW Space Bags are junk,"ITW Space Bag BRS-59112 Vacuum-Seal Storage Bags, Extra Large, Set of 2I seldom rate products but this one is so bad I must let others know. Don't waste your money. You might as well pack your stuff in a garbage bag. Those who rate this product immediately after using it are doing a disservice to others. Take some time to see if it lasts. We used several and after 4 weeks (probably earlier but didn't check) the vacuum was gone and was totally expanded. Instead of being an inch thick, it was now a foot thick. We stored them under a bed and had trouble getting them out as once expanded they pushed up against the bed bottom."
1,Never again,"Like everyone else said, this product is a waste of time. All of the horror stories are true. The zipper breaks, the bag tears, and if you are lucky to keep this from happening and suck the air out, it eventually inflates anyway. Before someone slapped a label on this my parents were using large ziploc bags, sat on them and this turned out to work just as well. Silly me thought that this would be more efficient. Sometimes doing it the simplest way is best. Save your money."
1,Abort! They don't hold the vacuum seal,"These things are junk. About 3 hours after vacuuming them shut, you'll notice the bags are getting bigger because air is going back in. They don't hold a vacuum seal."
2,Lost in Space,"What a disappointment! I bought a number of these bags a little over a year ago, and was initially excited when first using them. I simply could not get over the fact that they seemed to work as advertised - bulky comforters, linens and extra pillows were shrunken into wafer-thin packages that I could easily slide under my bed.This fall, my excitement turned to frustration when I reached under the bed to pull out the comforter and pillows only to find that the bags had re-inflated and were now stuck! Since I couldn't exactly fit a vacuum cleaner under the bed to RE-deflate them, I spent the next ten minutes lying on the floor, wrestling these bags from under the bed. To top it all off, I tore two of the three bags in the process!This is a great concept, but it obviously has not yet been mastered. Save your money as Space Bags are really just a waste of space."
1,space bags suck,"Great in theory, dismal failure in execution. I tried these once before, the main problem is that they dont stay sealed, air escapes and they become nothing more than overpriced plastic bags. The luggage size, non-vacumn sealed rolled variety dont work at all. The vacumn sealed larger bag sizes arent much better. Of my previously purchased set, I have only one bag that survived my move sealed, flat and intact.My new place has limited storage so I gave it another try. Now, its 1:22am, I've been fighting with a brand new pack for several hours. I have the floor littered with 6 large stuffed bags. I've tried re-vacumning and resealing and even duct taping - they plump right back up! I give up!!! Never again. Just use garbage bags. The only benefit is that you can see whats inside and that it is a thick, sturdy plastic bag."
2,bags not staying air tight,Just after a few days some of the bags are not staying as air tight as when we sealed them up originally.
1,terrible 3,"I got sucked in on this item. If it sounds to good to be true etc. See my other reviews on this. Do not be dumb like me and throw out the packaging until you see that something works. Amazon is great, this product is just not good. I never used to read reviews, most said what I am saying. My first review on this was great product until I checked under the bed. Deflated! I redid them and still would deflate. 1 out of 8 worked."
1,this is a junk,"dont waste your money. this is a junk, easy to get broken for only one time used. The quality are so poor"
1,Zipper will not stay zipped,"The zipper on these bags will not stay zipped, therefore the air will not stay out of the bag and the bag will not stay compressed.The first time I tried to zip the bag, the zipper holder fell off. I put it back on but it didn't help zip the bag. I then zipped it by hand, making sure I tightly zipped every bit of the zipper.I used two extra large size bags, one for a queen size comforter and the other for 4 accent pillows. Neither bag would stay zipped.They are a waste of money."
1,DONT'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I should have listened to the other reviews, but I thought I'd see for myself if it was a good buy or not. One of the bags did stay compressed, but only for 5 days. The other bag would not stay compressed no matter what I did. The makers of these bags really need to get their stuff together and make these bags better."
1,"Terrific Idea, terrible product!!","I was about to order these, and saw the bad reviews. I thought these were a bunch of monkeys that weren't any smarter than the bag itself!! I used them before and they worked just GREAT!! But to be on the safe side I checked the ones I have already used to make sure they were still working. ALL seven of them have lost their vacuum!! I won't be ordering any more of these until they improve the quality of them!! I would NOT recommend them to anyone for any reason!! Of all my reviews, this is my only negative one!!"
4,These worked better than I expected,"After reading many reviews saying these things didn't work, I was hesitant to buy them. But I was desperate to consolidate 3 large boxes of quilts and blankets that were stored in my basement, so I decided to give the Space Bags a try. I didn't have any trouble keeping the bags sealed at all. They've been sealed for over a month now with no leaks. I would recommend that after you seal the bag, you put your ear down to it to see if you can hear any air leaking. At first I heard air leaking out and realized I hadn't secured the zipper closure all the way across. After realizing that, these bags worked perfectly. Three huge boxes were condensed into 2 Space Bags in my basement."
1,A Plastic Bag Lasts Longer Than These......,"I bought space bags for a move and now that I'm moving again I find out they are really only good for single, short term use. The blue ""sealers"" break off easily. The bags that still have sealers do not hold and often break in random places after sucking the air out. I can't imagine they would be any good for long term storage."
2,"OK storage, but leak and tear easily","I bought a bunch of these to move with. This Extra Large size was useful for packing bedding in, but the zippers can be very contrary (falling off, or not zipping smoothly), the valves leak, and the bags tear fairly easily. All of these problems were worst on the XL bags."
1,Cheap product. Falls apart after a couple of uses. Zip seal is very weak.,"We have had these space bags for a year. The zipper is cheap and does not seal well, the plastic on the vacuum nozzle comes off readily, and the plastic gets brittle and tears easily. Take it from a year of experience; this brand of vacuum bags has been nothing but bad news."
4,"Great for space, but not the best quality","I used these bags during a move and also for clothes I put in storage. At first they work great, but essentially they're just giant zip lock bags. The little slide that opens and shuts the bag kept falling off, so I just closed the bag by hand like I would a sandwich baggie. They did work great keeping out moisture. I had clothes in an unairconditioned storage unit for a year and they were all in perfect condition. No smell or anything. I think these are good products, but might need a little patience when using."
5,unique,This is a unique collection if you're looking for piano music from a bygone age. I was so happy to discover scores for some of the music my grandmother listened to. It's nice to know that publishers find this kind of retrospective worthwhile in an age when many don't look back beyond the 1990s.
5,"More Than A Century of Great Tunes - A Century Old, That Is","It wasn't exactly the 'Gay Nineties' because the country was in a depression and mortality rates were still rather high. Still, there were some songwriters that saw promise, and the idea of marketing sheet music in large quantities was just starting to take hold. That said, even younger generations are bound to know many of the tunes contained within. There are also some neat surprises, as many songs you may think you know had verses attached that often changed the meaning of or solidified the better-known choruses. You'd be amazed at the amount of innuendo contained within many of the verses AND choruses. The library of every serious pianist and/or skilled singer hould have a copy. You can also find many of the pieces already recorded on my web site. Compare the ratio of an average of $6.00 per song in original sheet music form to 89 songs contained within this book. That's not 'fuzzy math'. Get it now!"
3,Reproduction flaw ?,"I am not familiar with Mozart's opera overtures at all. The last track "" La finta giardiniere "" ends very suddenly, which sounds very much like a flaw in the reproduction or manufacturing process."
4,The language of teenagers,"This is a gift book to honor the journey to adulthood with 42 poems chosen from a variety of cultures and eras. The poems and writings express love, encouragement and support from parents to their teenager moving into adulthood. The cover of the book is made out of handmade paper crafted from mulberry trees, with real flower petals, grasses, leaves and bark embedded in the paper. This old technique is used in order not to cut down trees or harming the environment. Here we will just give one example of the 42 poems by selecting the one by Jean Lamey:Within you is an ideal a voice of youth and a promise of achivement still to come. Within yor hands are special gifts and talents. Within your mind is the source of your dreams... Within you is the promise of the future, and I believe in you.A nice and special small gift. The Blue Mountain Press has other books in the same series, like The language of love, The language of happiness."
2,Not good,"This will be great for Soda Stereo fans, but from a music critic stand point, Soda stereo's Unplugged is light years behind Mana's.There just isnt enough juice here for me."
2,BOO! to this redesign!,"They've redesigned them! The new enhancers are smaller and thinner than the original design. While the new design's thinner edges blend in better with natural breast tissue, their enhancement qualities are diminshed. I think the designers could keep the thinner edges without making them thinner overall. I'm quite disappointed."
5,Change Your Life,"William Spear has an immense talent for translating profound ancient eastern wisdom into a clear and direct tool for modern life. His straightforward self-evaluation exercise is particularly eye opening.Feng Shui Made Easy has made a large effect on my life. It promtped me into a dedicated study of Feng Shui. With my Feng Shui eyes, I find that my environment is a constant mirror for my inner life and growth."
5,Fire,"This is an excellent recording of a wonderful singer, great guitarist and fine ensemble. I got interested in the singer from an ancient movie soundtrack, Siesta was the movie, Dime the song, a haunting balad, which is gladly included. She is Lole Montoya, the music is flamenco mashed with Arabic and what at times sounds like Indian coloring. It is fresh, all acoustic, at once sophisticated and immediate. Well done on all levels. This work is admirable in many ways. Lole's intimate fiery voice projects innocence and abandon at once. I am connected to her through the heart even though I do not know the meaning of the lyrics. The project completely ignores technology, and all to the better."
1,Maggie's Dream keep dreaming,"First of all I agree with Stig Five ""stigstiggy"" when he says the album is boring and forgettable. I couldn't even sit through 3 bars of each track. Out of the 11 songs I only felt that 2 of them were even worth listening to. Good effort but (yawning) try again."
2,Maggie's Yawn,"I've listened to this about 4 times over the past 13 years and today will be my last as I'll be tossing the CD in the garbage and using the case for a data CD. The music is completely forgetable, the lyrics simplistic. Not one song is even remotely memorable. As soon as it's over it's like I didn't even listen to it. Two stars is too high a rating but it doesn't deserve the worst rating either, it's just pain old boring..."
4,Classic Zelazny,This is a book club edition of the 5 original Amber novels featuring Corwin. It does not contain that later 5 novels. It offered me a trip down memory lane. I devoured the books when they first came out and 30 years later they still stand up pretty well.
3,new arrivals,"Big photos of newborns - black and white. Slightly amusing, but what is the point really?"
4,"Its a very useful, detailed map","This map has excellent detail, covering all the terrain from south of Madrid to the northern coast, and from Salamanca in the west to Zaragoza in the east. Includes even little-used country roads. Also has a 7"" inset of Madrid and city/road index. But it is missing features we expect in US maps: double-sided printing, more city insets."
3,a map,"so. it was a map, It covered the area advertised. It had ben used by someone else. BUT, It was advertised as available in pounds sterling, but I was charged in USD.HUMPH"
1,Bitter Revisionist,"In an interview on C-SPAN, John Toland freely admitted he was staunchly anti-FDR, an opinion he attempts to subtle infect the reader with in Infamy. Along with FDR, Toland castigates Marshall, Knox, Stimson, and Stark with withholding vital information and supplies from Kimmel and Short based on third hand knowledge and the most flimsy of evidence. Samuel Eliot Morrison wrote a superb essay in the Atlantic Monthly during the late 1950s blasting the revisionist views towards Pearl Harbor made by Toland's predecessors on the subject Harry Elmer Barnes and Charles A. Beard. For those interested in a more credible account of the events preceding, the event itself, and the aftermath, buy Gordon W. Prange's At Dawn We Slept"
3,Be Carefull of Revisionist,"As a World War II buff with a library of over seventy volumns on just the Pacicic theater, I would strongly recomend that the reader consult several other authors in this field before accepting many of John Toland's conclusions. He seems to be at odds with many other historians and the reader should be in a position to make his own conclusions."
3,More Motives than Murderers,"Martin Metzger is a charismatic college professor who uses others for his own needs and desires. Lucy falls under this spell as soon as she meets him, as a student in his class. After they are married, she realizes his life does not change, including his sexual liaisons.Lucy learns she is the chief suspect in her husband&#65533;s murder the same time as she learns he is dead. Everyone believes Lucy murdered her husband&#65533;-including her father and her attorney. She can only clear herself by finding the real culprit.To this end, Lucy examines each person who might have a motive for Martin&#65533;s death. Through Lucy&#65533;s eyes each character&#65533;s relationship with Martin is explored, providing elements of the dead man&#65533;s life, his ways of treating others and the way he sees himself and his work. As she studies each character and the relationship to Martin she reveals she is not the only person with a motive for Martin&#65533;s death."
4,"Sexy, philandering 60s professor gets his!","Haven't we all fallen in love with at least one of our collegeprofessors during the emotional, erotic 60s? But how far did we evertake it? And if we did take it anywhere, did we ever consider the far-ranging implications for other peoples' lives? Probably not. Patricia Gebhard, a retired academician, seems to have a firm grip on the intimate battles that always seem to take place around an especially charismatic male in the crowd. Her characterizations of Martin, his long-suffering wife, and his young lover are particularly realistic. This quick read bought back the uneasy jealousy that must have been prevalent, though rarely spoken of, during the height of the sexual revolution, and presented an array of characters with motives for murder."
5,The unexpected greatness.,"Jimmy Buffett is best known for his songs about life in the islands. Though many people enjoy he songs, they would not consider Buffett to be a major contributor to contemporary literature. However, Where is Joe Merchant? is a wonderful tale. It is a fabulous book that everyone should read. No one has come close to the intracy of story telling as has Buffett, and almost no one has been able to match the sheer likability of Frank Bama. Buffett does a masterful job of weaving the story around and through his audience. It brings back the idea of sitting around the hearth, listening to the great tales told by true story-tellers. Jimmy Buffett is the essence of story teller. There are many writers in the world, but we are running dangerously short of story tellers, take advantage of one of the best left around."
3,LIGHT AND AIRY; SHALLOW LIKE A TIDE POOL,"THE PLOT'S IN THE TITLE, NOT WITHIN THE PAGES. A POPULAR BEST SELLER, BUT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SOMETHING SERIOUS THERE ARE OTHER BOOKS. BUFFET RACES ALONG, FLITTERING FROM PLACE TO PLACE, CHARACTER TO CHARACTER, SUNTAN TO SUNTAN. SOPHOMORIC WRITING, BUT IT'S READABLE."
3,Carl Hiaasen he ain't...,"Sorry Parrothead fans everywhere. I found the book disjointed and the plot hard to follow. Buffett should stick to short stories and music. A novelist he's not. A sporting attempt, however. If you really like novels with whacked-out offbeat and oddball characters, I suggest trying Carl Hiaasen. Try ""Stormy Weather"" or ""Tourist Season"" for starters. Nobody depicts the wackiness of South Florida quite like Miami Herald columnist and novelist Hiaasen."
5,Surprised by what he can do,"I must say that I hadn't really expected much of Mr. Buffett in the realm of novel writing. But I was pleasantly surprised! I loved this book. I couldn't put it down, I was so tied to the adventures of the characters. At first, I thought the story had NO ties whatsoever, but as I read on, the lives became more intertwined. It was a great read. And I will gladly recommend it to anyone!"
3,Boring...,"You read the description of this book and expect it to be a tropical thriller that would keep you on the end of your reading chair. Not true. I thought the book had good character development and a great concept, but a bad delivery. In my opinon, Jimmy Buffett did a poor job bringing everything together. This is one of those books where you'll read 3 pages and have no idea what you just read because you were totally thinking about something else. This is one of those books where you force yourself halfway through it, waiting for it to get better but it never does. I would have much rather been reading J.K. Rowling or Dan Brown while eating a cheeseburger in paradise."
5,Where is Joe Merchant?,This book is a deffinate must read for any Buffett fan .His charicters and perdiciments are priceless in this easy to read novel. The best book written in the last 30 years.
4,Nobody but Buffett,"Nobody but Jimmy Buffett could have written this book. A piece of classic literature it's not, but as far as a book to sit on the beach with... it's perfect."
4,Jimmy Buffett meets James Redfield,"Being a Parrothead, saw him in Boston on 3/38/99, I could not help but pick up this book. I felt Jimmy was doing a comic,cosmic version of The Ninth Insight. He gives a lot of information that could help you with your celastial navigation, and throws in some Banana Wind and other lyrics and characters. I read Pirate Looks At 50 first, and plan on reading Tales From Margaritaville. I felt he hurried up the ending in Where Is JM, which gave him a great excuse for a sequel...Donde Esta Desdemona?"
3,Good Book,I enjoyed reading this book. I should have read the books in sequence! It was easy for me to read.
4,jimmy buffett's novel,The story revolves around the islands and takes us there and into the life style with enough seaplane info to keep aviation buffs intrigued.
5,Great Book from a great song writer,"Great book, interesting the whole time, Jimmy buffett is a great song writer and performer never doubted he could make a very interesting story come to life inside your head and heart"
1,Too scatterbrained for me,"While I love Jimmy Buffett's music, I finally had to give up on the book after around 120 plus pages. He kept introducing new characters and going into events that happened to the characters that seemingly had nothing to do with the story (Maybe he tied it all together at the end.) I will never know, because I lost interest."
2,"Fans dig it, but is it good?","Colorful characters and some excellent settings. The plot is weak and the ending was poor. Mostly read (and rated?) by his fans. If you love the music, you may be entertained by some of the references between the songs and the book."
2,Where is Joe Merchant? Who cares?,"Once again I am left dissappointed with Buffett's incredibly shallow writing. With no character development and constant, shameless self promotion (using song titles, lyrics throughout the book in an attempt to sell more of his music) I've found his writing to be the perfect cure for my insomnia. I wish he'd stick to song writing and give up trying to become a novelist."
2,Disappointing,"I like Jimmy Buffett - I really do; and I wanted to like his book, Where is Joe Merchant? Unfortunately, the book wasn't very good. The plot was labored and the story itself did not hold my interest. It was not a good sign when midway through the book I couldn't care less if they found Joe Merchant or not. (The search for an allegedly deceased pop who is regularly sighted? Where have I seen THAT headline before?)While the hero, Frank Brown's mis-adventures were mildly entertaining, and the sly allusions to characters in old Buffett songs was clever, it was not enough for me give it a higher rating. As other reviewers have mentioned, perhaps Jimmy was trying too hard. Buffett's first effort at writing is by far the better book."
3,Let's not get carried away,"I've been looking at the reviews written by others and I have to believe people are carried away by their love of Jimmy Buffet. I wish I were him after reading A Pirate Looks at Fifty, and I wish I were him again now that I see how much everyone liked his book despite the fact that it was just average. I love the quick and easy type of 'light' reading where this book fits, but the plot was disconnected. At times I began to forget the fact that the book even had a plot. What I really did enjoy was living vicariously through the the characters in the Jimmy Buffet lifestyle. I also will admit to being surprised by the ending, whiich made the book enjoyable in the end. But the storyline itself was not that great. I continued reading just to stay close to the water and the airplane."
5,Fun Plot & Wonderfully Bizarre Characters,"I can honestly say that this book appealed to both the avid reader AND the avid Parrothead in me! This was interesting and entertaining, with a typically Jimmy Buffett exotic setting and some fascinating and bizarre characters. Characters such as Frank Bama, Trevor Kane, Blanton Meyercord (my personal favorite!), Rudy Breno, Charlie Fabian, Colonel Cairo and of course the amazing Desdemona all made this a hard-to-put-down story.A special note for Parrotheads: Although this is a book for anyone who likes reading bizarre love & adventure stories, Parrotheads will especially appreciate the subtle (and even not-so-subtle) references to your favorite Buffett songs. Pay special attention to the names of the chapters! :->Anyone who has always wondered about Desdemona while listening to ""Fruitcakes"" and ""Desdemona's Building a Rocket ship"" should definitely read this book - all the answers are here!"
3,Not what I expected,"I had just read, A SALTY PIECE OF LAND, by Jimmy Buffett, and because I LOVED it, I rushed to buy WHERE IS JOE MERCHANT? assuming it would be as good as it. It was definitely a disappointment. It was not the escape to paradise that A SALTY PIECE OF LAND was. This was quite graphically violent and unpleasant most of the book. Yes, it had a happy ending, but overall, the book was not at all what I expected. :("
4,Ya gotta love the chapter titles at least!!,"""That's my story and I'm sticking to it""?? I was singing the whole way through this book. I found this at a used English-language book stall in a village on Turkey's Turquoise Coast, and used it to escape endless hours of boredom, waiting for tourists to charter our gulet. The Turkish captain got so tired of hearing me burst out laughing, he nearly tossed me overboard. This is ESCAPISM par excellance! Even if you're not a Buffet fan, you'll love these characters...they occupy every beach shack in the world."
5,incredible book,I had to read this book in like the fifth grade and it was incredible. It was happy and sad and just one of the best books i have ever read.
5,Heartwrenching and Funny at the Same Time,"The author writes about a teenage boy very realistically and entertainingly as he practices drums for a big concert, thinks about girls, and also processes his young brother's diagnosis and treatment of leukemia.The main character's family reacts to the trauma in different ways, which brings added conflict, and the main character often feels sorrow and guilt. But there are also humorous scenes and joyful occasions. This fast-paced book does a great job of mixing comedy and drama."
5,Sad but amazing,This is one of the best books I have ever read by Jordan sonnenblick she is an amazing author and I can wait for her to write another book
5,"Drums, Girls and Dangerous Pie","Drums, Girls, and Dangerous Pie is a great book, one of the reasons I really enjoyed it was because it's about a character in my age group, which lets is relate to the story. The story is about how a young 6 year old named Jeffrey is diagnosed with a disease, but this is shown from his 13 year old brother's point of view. The older brother, Steven, eventually has a change of feeling towards his younger brother Jeffrey, and everything around him."
1,Didn't like it!,"Sorry, I just didn't find this book realistic at all. The author tries very hard, but does not succeed in writing a well written book about childhood cancer.It is extremely hard to do and the author was very unsuccessful with this book.Skip it!"
5,Best ever,Best ever!!This book is the best . It reminds me to never take my sister for granted and to always be by her side!!
5,You do not want stop reading,"You know those books you don't want to take out of your hands and you search for words to describe what you liked about it...Well this is one of them. This book, written from the point of view of a thirteen year old boy, who sees himself confronted with the fact that his five year old brother has cancer. It's straightforward, with no exaggeration. A work, full of wisdom that shows how we much too often think about things we can't change instead of seeing what we can.Another book that opens the door to seeing other possibilities one can choose in life isWorking on Yourself Doesn't Work: The 3 Simple Ideas That Will Instantaneously Transform Your LifeGive yourself the gift of both these books!"
5,Awesome,"This is one fun computer program to mess around with. If you are by yourself in the car it is pretty much useless unless you want to pull over and read it but if with someone else it can direct you where to go with little or no trouble at all. It has some cool features such as it shows your current speed, altitude, and heading. The coolest thing is three CD's give you maps of the U.S. and they will show your location on any street no matter the size. The set up is very easy and it is very self explanatory. If you want something that will navigate you to your destination this is what you need. It beats any maps and is much cheaper and more detailed then any handheld gps reciever, but since it is not handheld it can be a pain not being able to use it while you are driving."
2,Brown Leather Creative Zen case,This case does NOT fit the 60 BG unit and does not have a plastic cover to protect the screen. It is also not an attractive color for the black unit. Is quite pricey for what one gets. I do not recommend it. The very least this item should have is a shield to protect the screen of the MP 3 player.
1,WARNING,This does not fit the 60GB model. There is a footnote on the creative site and nothing in the description here.
4,Nice case,It's a really nice case that I have been complimented on a couple times while my teachers were confiscating my ZEN. The one thing I don't like about it is after a while it started to scuff the ZEN.
5,Good product,Sturdy casing for Vision M although would have liked a plastic overlay for screen protection sewed into case but still a good product.
3,"Too much Joyce, not enough Harvey","I got this book under the mistaken impression that it was written solely by Harvey. In fact, it was co-written with his wife Joyce. I'd estimate that a good 75% of it was written by Joyce. This would be no problem if she shared Harvey's brilliance and humor, but she doesn't. She's self-absorbed and self-righteous, and she spends a great deal of her time trying to convince us of what a good, wise person she is. For example, even as Harvey is close to death, Joyce is weeping crocodile tears for some young people she barely knows in Israel who might be in danger (but aren't). In other words, she's exactly the kind of pompous phony a healthy Harvey would deflate. The art stinks, too.BUT, at least we have 25% or so of Harvey's writing, and the story itself isn't bad. A no-holds-barred look at a cancer patient going through chemo and radiation."
3,Kind of quirky,"It was very quick reading. The author portrays himself and his loved ones in a realistic, and, sometimes,not so flattering way. I didn't care for the drawing style at all. It seemed too sloppy and distracted from the story. The little details about having to deal with sometimes insensitive medical providers when you are at your most vulnerable will probably strike a chord with almost everyone who has dealt with any illness. It was worthwhile reading."
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, I didn't like this book. I thought the parts about Joyce's work were pedantic, and I didn't like any of the characters. I felt bad for them, certainly, but that's all the feeling I could dredge up."
2,Not a fan,"This was a quick read, and interesting I will give it that. The characters are written realistically and you can really get into the characters. But sometimes it deviates unnecessarily and the drawing style is very distracting. After meeting the authors, the drawing's, which are supposed to have a gritty realism about the people, does not resemble them in the slightest. Which just distracts me while I'm reading since I now see them as sloppy"
1,I was disappointed...,"I bought this book on faith, having greatly enjoyed ""American Splendor Presents: Bob & Harv's Comics"" (which was illustrated by R. Crumb). I expected a personal story, a slice of life, an attempt to make sense of tragedy. But what I found instead was unimpressive graphics (this book is NOT illustrated by Crumb!) and bombastic lectures on the mid-East and domestic politics, including much anti-Israel commentary. The political proclamations rubbed me the wrong way, but even if I'd been sympathetic, I think I would have been disappointed by the bad art and lack of focus on the professed topic."
4,Learn to read the art as well,"It's very important to emphasize here that Frank Stack's artwork is not ""sloppy"" or ""crude"" in any sense. He and Bill Griffith probably have the strongest straight-art chops of anybody doing comics now. But Stack isn't just technically accomplished. Once you learn to follow his deceptively simple lines, he's profoundly expressive in his impressionist manner. Especially dealing with the tough stuff in this story, he finds the exact unsentimental tone. If he was a more prolific storyteller (or had just a bit more vivid sense of humor) his work would be mentioned right with Griffith, Crumb, Sheldon, Williams, Woodring -- the likes of those. Barbner and Pekar's single finest stroke may have been choose Stack to do the art for ""Our Cancer Year."""
3,Topics in Mathematics,"I saw URI using this book for a course taught there. The book wasn't what I expected when I got it. The topics are ok, but I don't like the style of the book. The book is just verbose in my opinion. However, some people like that kind of style in a book. If you like a wordy book in mathematics then I highly recommend this book to you."
3,It works.,"My teacher for this class seemed to think that it is vague in parts, and a bit wordy. Regardless, for the concepts it covers, it is effective."
2,Pretty much a slow and boring film!,"I can see why this film was held up from DVD release. I was interested in it because it starred Shirley McClaine, one of my favorite actresses. It turned out to be a very boring and slow film with the plot hard to follow. Shirley's acting was great but not enough to overcome the boring aspect of the film. You can rent it but do not buy it like I did-I feel ripped off."
4,review of Desperate Characters,"This movie is about the angst of a middle-aged couple in New York City. It's boring, but I'm giving it four stars because of Shirley MacLain's nude scenes. She has two. The first is with her lover, but you see only her legs and body as she's lying against her lover covering all the naughty bits. The second is what gives the movie four stars. She bares her lovely breasts with her husband, played by Kenneth Mars, while in their home in the country. These two scenes are the only interesting bits of the whole movie, but their good enough to give it four stars."
4,Great for beginners,I purchased this book as a gift for a beginning Bonsai grower and it proved to be just the right choice. The photos are clear and beautifully done. Instructions are concise. I would highly recommend this book for anyone hoping to start a Bonsai garden.
4,Nice.. but wish it had a little more technical information,"The book has LOVELY pictures and explains some tecniques but I wish tha he would have gone a little more in depth and been more specfic... the ""instructions"" were overly generalized.I still recomend it though."
4,I use Compost Teas on my Bonsai plants now,"Compost Tea Making: For Organic Healthier Vegetables, Flowers, Orchards, Vineyards, LawnsI collect Bonsai books. Gorgeous book, great photos, and very professionally laid out. it is pretty much the same info [very good] as in the authors other books, but this one is the flagship. It gave me some good ideas, and is certainly inspiring considering the plants that are photographed."
1,Very Little Useful Information,"I recently purchased The Complete Book of Bonsai by Harry Tomlinson, and I am very disappointed with the content. Much of the book contains the same photos and information as 101 Essential Tips: Bonsai (another book written by Harry Tomlinson). Overall neither book is very useful; the information is vague. If the author cannot create new information to put in his books, he should quit writing. The Bonsai Handbook by David Prescott is much more informative AND it is cheaper. I am very dissatisfied with all of Harry Tomlinson's books that I have purchased, and I will try to avoid his work in the future."
2,"3 Titles, same book",It's a good book with some good info. The problem is that there is 3 different books by this author that are all pretty much identical. It's kind of rediculous and it's a scam.
3,"An OK book, with a decent species guide","The book is OK, it contains some brief information on the basics of the art. However much of this can be accessed online, with much more detail and examples. The one good point about this book is its nice pictures and decent species list.If you want a book to skim through during the TV commercials, this is it."
4,Nice Pictures,"This book has lots of sharp color pictures. It includes all the overall steps in Bonsai growing : seeds, planting, pruning, pots, and arrangements. Each section though is a bit short with not as much practical information and description.The book does serve as a nice reference, and a browsing source for pictures of the different tree types that can be used as Bonsai. It does fall a little short on instructions and illustrations of actual Bonsai care."
5,"great research, well written and very important",This book documents a critical time in the history of the Sierra. All the top climbers of the day are at play and we really get to know them and their metal. BRILLIANT!!!
5,Sons of the Conquerors: The Rise of the Turkic World,"A superb book, easily readable, exhibiting an unparalleled combination of prudent scholarship, and excellent journalism. Mr. Pope studied his subject matter well, traveled over half the known world to observe all the Turkic people from China to Turkey.His interviews were excellent! It took a lot of stamina on his part to travel, meet, and interview the different people.Only Mr. Pope couldve accomplished this. Keep up the good work and keep on trucking Hugh. Very very highly recommended."
3,"A good book that needs polishing from time to time, by getting rid of prejudiced points on his main theme of Turkic folk !","I lost what I wrote for an hour since there is no ""undo"" button. So be it...Well... This is it -the title- for today."
4,"An interesting analysis of contemporary Turkey and the Turkic world, but...","Not a superior history, of course that was not the author's primary intent. But this book is another example of what can go wrong when a journalist ventures into the world of History.In particular the author's understanding of Central Asian History is very poor. He utilizes a very Pan-Turkist, Soviet, post-Soviet Nationalist, and Anatolian Turkish interpretation of Uzbek, Kazakh, Uyghur, Turkmen, and Anatolian Turkish history.On a certain level this book is interesting in that it shows how modern Turkic speakers perceive their own history and their relation to other Turkic groups. That said, the author is at his best when speaking about contemporary groups."
3,Nice offering from the Canadian songbird...,"I have just obtained a used copy of this CD, and it's an overall solid offering from 1990, though perhaps not as uniformly strong as the 1991 follow-up, ""Yes I Do."" Both of these albums were produced by Nashville veteran Jerry Crutchfield, and there's a nice mix of a pop flavoring balanced with sufficient strings to classify it as ""country"", or ""early 90's"" country, anyway.Best cuts are the suprisingly Jamaican-flavored offering ""Bluebird,"" which showcases Anne in fine form, and the stellar track, ""The Final Say,"" an ode to the power of true love. The album's closer, ""A New Moon, An Old Flame And You"" is also pleasant. A couple of weaker tracks are present here (""Mean Old Moon"" and A Little Short of Love"") but overall, worth your time to listen. For some reason, the song ""Wrong End of the Rainbow"" is repeated on both this CD and the ""Yes I Do"" album. Not sure what prompted that, but, in any case, give it a try."
2,"Contains mostly drawings, little description","This book had a lot of examples of Civardi's work but not a lot of tips or instructions about drawing it. In the beginning, there is a full page of suggestions but that's about all there is to it. Lots of pictures of body parts, no step-by-step, no breakdown of lines or sections. Basically, the book shows you the finished products, not really the process of drawing. As another reviewer said, if you would like a book with a lot of examples of his work, this is it.I would suggest Jack Hamm's ""Drawing the Head and Figure"" over this book. Lots of substance, and the instruction is done in a way that leaves lots of room to create a unique style."
2,Mercury Outboard Shop Manual 3.5-40 Hp 1972-1989,"I ordered (Mercury Outboard Shop Manual 3.5-40 Hp 1972-1989) and received(Mercury Outboard Shop Manual 3.5-40 Hp 1972-1984). 1984 not 1989, that means 5 not covered.Wally"
5,an added bonus....,"As a long-time fan of Dame Judi Dench, I found this book to be a perfect companion to her autobiography by John Miller 'Judi Dench: With a Crack in Her Voice'. I didn't have the advantage of following her life more closely by living in England. When I read the autobiography, I wanted to 'see' more of her to sense this life she was sharing with us. This book gives the reader a full spectrum of her life and the pictures are wonderfully presented. I am so glad to have added this to my collection which also includes 'Darling Judi'. For me, the three books together complete a full and beautiful picture of this wonderful lady and actress."
3,Not for the TV Judi Dench Fan...,"This is a very good quality book and talks about Judi Dench's life from the beginning, but it's not what you might think.If you're just a huge fan of her TV works, this book will be greatly disppointing. Although the pages are a thick, high glossy quality, the print is ENORMOUS with lots of ""junk"" fillers (an entire page with 1 quote). It does has a lot of old pictures and details her work history well, but I was quite disappointed nonetheless. I loved A Fine Romance and As Time Goes By; However less than 6 pages talked about her TV Life.I was expecting more of a biography. My advise is to thumb through this one locally and really know what your buying before hand. I am a HUGE fan, but this isn't the right book for everyone."
4,Judi Dench: Scenes from My Life,Quite enjoyable. Nice to get a take on the richness of her remarkable career. The insight she brings to her acting tell volumes between the lines. Certainly one of the greatest artists of our time yet modest and endearing.
4,eliot morris,"i saw eliot in concert this summer, he has a very interesting voice, the cd is great. this is a ""go to"" cd when you need some new music. i hope we will be hearing a lot more from eliot. i would recommend this to everyone who likes to step away from the same old top forty.............."
1,disappointed,"when i read this book i was really disappointed with all in it esp.the models,they're too plain and the makeover is not good,everybody can do that kind of makeup,no need any simple technique as told in this book"
3,fun to read,"What I like about this book is the models are ""real"" people that have pimples, dark eye circles, chubby faces...I'm tired of seeing already-perfect girls being made-up, give me some plain janes who really need it! The results are overall satisfying, although I don't think she did a good job on one or two of them. The classification on skin tones are too general, most people are not simply fair, medium, or dark. The book is a quick read, so the information within can't be very extensive, but she did offer some good advice about shading, concealing imperfections, and I am actually grateful she included how to create a double-eyelid look, because I have one eye that is double-lid and one eye that isn't!"
2,:-(,"I have expected more from this book! Slightly disapointed.In my opinion, there are no special technique details mentioned for the asian womens makeup. If I would have known that, I wouldn't have bought this book. For some nice pictures I give 2 stars."
4,Good starter book. Shipping sucks,"Pro: Very thorough book that describes the basics of makeup ranging from an overview of makeup types in the market (i.e. liquid foundation, powder foundation, etc), which type of skin they're good for (i.e. oily, combination, normal), and tools, to makeup tips for different types of facial features.Con: Since it goes into so much detail about the basics, not too much advanced techniques are included. Also, it took me ONE MONTH to receive my book. My suggestion is to buy this book somewhere else."
3,Not exactly what I expected,I was expecting to see more emphasis on eye makeup. The book was typical of all other makeup books on the market.
3,Very Basic,"Very basic. I like how non-models were used for the majority of tutorials.I was hoping though to see more makeup styles and more detail into achieving those styles.The section that frustrated me the most were on brushes. It has pretty pictures of them but the text is not by the brushes so it's hard to associate them. There's also no tutorial on how to use them. That section was near useless for me. I got a brush set from MAC, but I still can't figure out what's for what.It's a decent beginner's book - finally one for the asian face! It covers a large breath, but there's very little depth."
3,a little bit disappointed,This held my interest for about 2 min. I have read some great books on how to apply cosmetics. This for far too generic and not enough specifics.
2,All About British Poultry Regulations,"This book was a great disappointment to me. Instead of learning about free-range poultry, I learned more than I ever wanted to know about the astonishing overregulation of the British poultry industry. The topic is apparently too broad to leave much room to talk about poultrykeeping."
3,"A little late in the ""Beat Rush""","I would have given this video another star if it would have been one of the first works on the beats I had seen. But, there are more videos on the beats than any other group of writers with the possible exception of expatriate writers in France of the 30's! The value of this video is found in the interviews. The beat writers are great storytellers on and off the page, and it is a joy to see them in action. If this is your first video on the beats I recommend those by Mystic Video also available at Amazon."
5,"Mother of Mercy, healing rosary",The best cd of the rosary I have ever heard. Very healing...Use it everyday...just sorry it does not have the Luminous mysteries.
2,Better software available at lower cost,"Family Tree Maker 2005 is little more than the old Ancestry Family Tree software that was available for free download from Ancestry.com. The sales pitch put on be the maker online was misleading. I returned it for refund the same day I bought it. Legacy Family Tree by Millenia Corp. costs less, easier to use, produces better looking reports, and provides frequent free updates and ""tweaks""."
3,Not worth the price,"Product is nice and is quite simple to use, if you know all the information to plug in. Most of us don't have 100's of hours to research every person in their family tree. That is where I thought this product would help in looking up several on-line databases. However, it was unable to find anyone in my family, from my 11 year old son, up to my great grandparents.Also, the search results were quite staggering in that you got thousands of people that are no where near who you put in. I seemed to be getting many people with the same last name and of different sex than the search I was running.If you are successful in looking up someone and want to continue using the in-depth on-line tools, the price is quite high. I suggest purchasing any cheaper product as you will spend too much for what you get with this one."
5,A must see show for any comedy lover!,If you have never seen this show you should. It is full of off the cuff hilarious moments and great one liners. If you have seen the show you know exactly what to expect...the show!!!There is one thing that could make this better however - ALL THE SEASONS!!!
5,Would love more,I watched the reruns of the show many times. Love the DVD. Wished I had more of the season shows.Always a great laugh and wonderful creativity.
3,Audio Synch Issues?,"This uncensored version comes with 2 discs. I've played sections of both discs and it appears that the audio is slightly ahead of the video. It's not incredibly annoying, but it is disappointing.Seeing the uncensored sections is amusing; For example, they show you clips where the ""censor guy"" comes out and warns Drew that they can't air a scene where Wayne Brady has fallen in love with a hamster."
3,Important info not revealed!,"I wanted this specific DVD so I looked for it here and read the info from the seller. They failed to mention it can't be used on U.S. DVD players, an important note! Most DVDs that aren't set to your region ""can"" be changed to play on your DVD BUT only up to 4 times. If you turn it on for one minute, that counts as one time. Do that 4 times and you can never watch it again.Wasn't worth my time or money to send it back so after I watch it 2 more times (the first two times were to figure out what was wrong with it), I can never view it again."
5,Great Show But I Found That You Need To Buy Both...,"I love Whose Line, so just before this show was released, I pre-ordered the Uncensored version. I loved the special features it had, it was very entertaining and hilarious but...I found out there is more to it.I found out when I bought the Censored version that there are different special features on the Censored disc 2.Never Before Seen Outtakes for the Censored version disc 2.1) Film, TV and Theatre Styles2) Sound Effects3) Shopping From Home4) Bar Scene5) Foreign Film Dub6) AnimalsNever Before Seen Outtakes for the Uncensored version disc 2.1) Questions Only2) Scenes From a Hat3) Animals4) Duet5) Bar Scene6) Greatest HitsThe Bar Scene and Animals are the same suggestion on both versions. But the Uncensored version shows more on what happened while they did Bar Scene. And the Gag Reels are pretty much the same except the uncensored version has more to show than the censored version. But really not suitable for children."
2,The DVD is great!,"Like i said, the dvd is great, it's just the fact that there's only 2x disk 1 in my box, so i kinda didnt really get what i paid for :(WLIIA rules!"
2,Doesn't deliver,The 'censored' material shows how ridiculous the television censor system is- scenes appeared to be cut for topic material that wasn't obviously offensive but for what the censors seemed to think they implied.
3,A little concerning,"I bougth the title bwcause my daughter Loves this show, & it said it was censored so I assumed it would be ""censored"" Shame on me I should have watched it before I let her."
4,"A must have DVD, but where is the entire season??","As one of many huge fans of this show (why did they take this show off the air!??!!) I was thrilled to find the first season on DVD. The skits are great and the uncensored scenes are funny and interesting. The big flaw? The entire first season is not on the DVD!! Why not?? So many great skits and comments are left off this DVD. Hopefully, the makers of the DVD won't make the same mistake with season 2 when it finally comes out."
1,Both discs are the same,"I love the episides I did receive. But despite the fact that the set came w/ discs labeled one and two, both are exactly the same. So I paid way to much for only five actual episodes."
4,Let's Get to the good stuff.,"I know this is the first season, but come on kids! Start releasing the really good skits from this show. More uncensored, more messups, more Colin!"
5,good buy,I was very pleased by this product. It was in excellent condition and packaged very well and was very happy with the product overall.
5,Hilarious,"This is the greatest show ever, and there's so many hours of fun on this DVD. This is a MUST HAVE product! Check out the gags on Special Features!"
4,Idon`t know,<i`m sorry but I haven`t received my dvd yet so what can i do thanks and i hope you could help me
3,Is better to watch the seasons on TV,"Nothing new, they're not even the best chapters. But if you want something to laugh for a while, and have it in your collection, buy it, at the lowest price posible."
5,Whose Line Is It Anyway,"The DVD was fine. I do have a problem though with the purchase itself. When I got on I typed in DVD's and the first thing that came up were ""adult DVD's."" I thought that this was in bad taste since minors most likely are logging on to Amazon as well.It would seem to me that there must be a way for adults only to get into the area of those types of DVD's. I would hope that you would work on this as I believe its important. I wouldn't think that Amazon wants that type of material to be easily acceptable.Geoff Zonder"
5,Better than it was on TV,"I bought this because I like the show, and just enough of the 'should be censored' stuff makes it to air that you KNOW that the uncensored show has to be much funnier.I was right.While the actual episodes shown are the ones that made it to air, as they were on the air, Disk 2 has the uncensored stuff on it, and it is GREAT!!As for the DVD images and sound, the colors and clarity are INCREDIBLE!! Much better than I expected. The image has no pixilation that I could see, and the sound is crisp and you can hear some of the comments much clearer than on the OTA show."
4,Whose Line is it Anyway Season 1 Vol 1 Uncensored,Very funny as always. Only disapointment was that it was not just strung together without the black outs from the commercial breaks . Liked the fact that the Uncensored parts where all in the extra's. That makes it possible for young adults to still enjoy this without seeing the uncensored parts.
5,Way to funny!,If your a fan of the show you will enjoy this one. Cant wait for other seasons to come out.
1,Music CD,The package arrived at my house with broken cover. The music was not that great either. This was a disappointing purchase. I wasted my money.
1,The worst Latin piano-based music I've heard,"Judging by the favourable reviews given by some other customersthere's obviously a market for piano player who surrounds himselfwith a soulless, synthezised accompaniment on every track, but ifyou want to hear genuine Latin piano maestros backed by real mus-icians - check out Bebo Valdes or Ruben Gonzalez."
5,I liked it very much!,"I heard one of her other albums and liked it a lot but this one was really captivating and I listen to it everyday. It's different,unique and it's great for dancing."
3,Fun game but missing parts,"A group of us were very excited to have a Murder Mystery party. I spent weeks preparing for the party with decorations and costumes. When it came time to set up the game, we realized that a play book was missing from the kit. We never received the groom's book, it could have ruined the game, it kind of did. We did get two books for the wedding planner. I am disappointed and when I contacted the company about this, I never got a response."
5,A little bit rock and pop,"This album is a must have for any Donny Osomond fan. My Love is A Fire does sound a bit like Escapade by Janet Jackson, but who cares, both are excellent songs. I love the One Bad Apple sample in Take Another Try at Love. Love Will Survive is a great ballad in the same vein as Sacred Emotion, on Donny's comeback album. Please check out this album. Every song is a winner!"
5,Safe,"My daughter loves Donny Osmond! I had an old cassette of the album right before this one, so for her birthday she wanted the rest of his albums up to the latest (even with Marie). I am grateful she is obsessed, fascinated, and in love with Donny rather than so many others that just want to stretch boundaries and hurt our kids.The album is up beat and still sounds good decades later."
2,nice thought bad product,"it is a well intentioned idea but the recoil is super strong ,it make it useless the fear of geting hurt ..nice thought though"
1,A broken ruler is better then this,"One of the worst products I ever bought. I know that sounds a bit over the top, but honestly this thing sucks. What's even worse is that I bought several of them as stocking stuffers this past xmas and kept 2 myself. As noted in another review, the recoil on this thing is dangerously quick. It could serve as a weapon if you would like. I don't know how many times I got hit in the hand with the recoil only to leave a nice size cut on my hand. Difinitely able to penetrate the skin for a little blood action. I ended up throwing it at the cement foundation wall in my basement. Pretty interesting what's inside. I relieved the anger that this thing caused me and now i'm happy to know that I won't ever have to use it again. Oh ya, I couldn't get my money back from the manufacturer. I'm really surprised this product hasn't been recalled."
5,Creative mess making...,"My 1 year old son has really enjoyed these paints. What a great variety of vibrant colors. Perfect for finger painting. He gets the paint all over his hands, arms, face and hair and it washes right off. I will absolutely be purchasing another set when these run out."
3,So so paint for the cost,This paint is a bit thick. I did add a drop of dish soap to make it more washable and when I put it into smaller containers for the kids I added a little water and that helped. It's pretty but just so thick.
3,Like the pumice,The black pumice popped off within two days. It still works. Just no longer attached to the handle.
3,Good product with a glitch,"I ordered this as a replacement for my last one, which lasted about 2 years. Bummer - this one broke after three weeks. Other than no longer having a handle, the stones work great!"
4,"Decent Mix of ""old style"" vs. ""new style"" albinoni","Well, you can't beat the price of this. If you like Albinoni, and you like oboe, you'll like this.I will say, however, it takes 1/3 of the disc to really hit its stride. The first few numbers definitely reflect an older, clunkier (circa 1960s) style of playing baroque music; this clunkiness tends to underscore Albinoni's concervatism relative to someone like Vivaldi (try Vivaldi by Europa Galante if you want to hear ""state of the art"" Italian baroque playing).Farther into this disc, however, the selections get more snappier and lively, and it becomes very pleasant indeed.One final cavil: I wish the music marketing world would STOP putting that darn adagio in g on every Albinoni disc! Who needs 7 copies of it? Its like that unwanted relative that shows up at every family function. Basta! I would rather have had another oboe concerto instead."
4,Our dog seems to enjoy these,"I guess the dog should be writing this, but I will say she really gets excited when I get this package down (but then she's a cheap date....gets excited about any treats). The first thing you'll notice is the odor (not pleasant) and then they are kind of greasy. When we gave our dog a whole one (she's an 8 yr old, 75# dog), she ended up puking later so after that we cut them in half and that seemed to work for her. They are a little pricey, but I'd probably get them again as a special treat."
5,"A ""Have-to-Have"" for the Classic Horror Movie collector","If you are into period, atmosphere-type horror movies from the 30s you have to have this set in your collection. I completely forgot about the unusual ending in ""Mark of the Vampire"" since I last saw it in the early 60s on TV. That was worth the price alone. ""The Devil Doll"" plot was quite good for the 30s...only to be somewhat reprised in the 50s with ""Attack of the Puppet People"". I like the eerie-ness of ""Mad Love"" with its focus on Peter Lorre's role rather than on Colin Clive's. (I was surprised to find out that it didn't make it at the box office when it first came out.) Just a GREAT COLLECTION all around!!!"
4,Winproxy 3.0,"WinProxy 3.0 is an extremely useful tool for linking several computers to a single modem for internet access. Just set up the TCP/IP protocol on Win 9x machines, and then load the software. The set up on the machine which acts as the server is simple. The software even prompts you to test the settings during the setup process. We are running the software on a network which is also running Netware 4.1 and there are no conflicts. This software was a good low cost alternative to a proxy server or modification of our existing Netware server."
2,"Frommer's Cancun, Cozumel and the Yucatan 2003","I purchased this particular guide book based on previous reviews, and was relying on it for most of my information for my recent vacation in Cancun. Unfortunately, not only was some of the information out of date, (I had thought that being the most recent guide it would be current) but most of the information wasincomplete. Example: Reguarding bus schedules and routes from the hotel zone to Puerto Jurez. (the ferry station for Isla Mujeres) This guide states that the Ruta 8 bus, goes there. When in fact, one has to take the Ruta 1 bus to downtown Cancun city and change for the Ruta 13 bus. Also, I found out that at least once an hour there is a Ruta 1 bus that goes directly the hotel zone to Puerto Jurez. Frommer's fails to mention this.This is just one of many examples.My advice, if you do purchase this guide, get another as an alternate."
2,metric system,"I am not sure the person who wrote the chapter on Isla Mujeres is familiar with the metric system. ""1 km or 1.6 miles."" The back of the book has a conversion chart showing that 1km = .62 miles. They make this conversion mistake all throughout this chapter."
2,Save Your Money,"Unless you are a first timer to the area this book will tell you very little. While the information regarding the area (complete with maps) can be helpful the information on new restaurants and hotels is non existant. (I notice they didn't list many resorts including the well known Palace properties). This can help you with local things but use some other source for where to stay/eat. I also found the web had more information then this book did. The only difference I can see with this book was that they added ""great websites"". Which really consist of about five very generalized sites. If you want an overall view it is fine. If you want detailed info (where to eat, where to stay) I would suggest another publication."
3,Adequate for your Parents,"This book is pretty much what you would expect from Frommers. A good book showing what to do, with a certain kind of audience in mind. I would have to say its not for the backpacker type or the budget traveler. But good if you are a don't get your feet wet kind of a person. ...."
1,a sad effort,"Poor Weinstein! He has used old discussions from his earlier books, and his revelation that socialists can now be found in Congress is quixotic. This is simplified history, simplified solutions, and poorly organized. The concluding chapters spend inordinate time on Booker Washington, W. E. B. DuBois and John Dewey. If it were simply a waste of money it would be less sad than the inane ideas presented here. Poor show."
5,Why look elsewhere?,"This is the best collection of law school statements around. Whatever your situation, there's an example to help you. I am 110% satisfied."
1,It was terrible!,It was really boring and I didn't like how the author rambled on and on about nothing important at all. It was the most awful book I have ever read.
1,junk,"I OWN AN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTING CO. WE REPLACED ALL ARE CORDLESS DRILL DRIVERS WITH THIS ONE.WE HAVE BROKE EVER ONE, THE CASE IS WEAK UNDER THE MOTOR AND BREAKS STRIAGHT BACK FROM THE TRIGGER"
2,Disappointing.,"I purchased this hammer drill based on favorable reviews at Amazon and favorable reviews of similar models in Consumer Reports. However, after less than 1 hour of total use, the selectors for hi/lo speed and hammer/drill only have become stiff and require excessive force to operate. This tool, which is made in China, does not seem adequate for professional use and should not be advertised as a ""professional"" tool."
2,Stay away from Hitachi,"Have one, case broke on first use and now the chuck is stripped . Only used a few times around the house. I will not buy Hitachi again."
2,That wood is no good.,"The ceramic dish is nice, solid...good. But...that wooden grate...that thing fell to pieces within a week.Now it's like I have bits of the Kon Tiki trying to keep my soap fresh and alive. It's failing.Boo."
3,Good dish ... bad insert.,"This is on the high end, price-wise, for a soap dish. But what we had tried before didn't work. So we went with this. The porcelain dish itself seems sturdy. The insert is thin, lightweight wood that appears to have been assembled by a child (it is made in China ...) with slightly cock-eyed alignment and glue showing everywhere. We also didn't trust that it wouldn't self-destruct with soap and water over time, so we put two coats of polyurethane on it over a couple of days. Bit of a pain."
4,Soap dishes,"I ordered 4 of these at one time. Three of them were in great shape, but the 4th had no wooden holder for the inside of the soap dish. There was a problem with the packaging, obviously. Overall, I like the item for its use, but wish they could have all been ""complete."""
4,Reliable and concise,"Short, concise, and helpful. This is a great introduction to theology. It covers a lot of ground in small space and gives the reader lots of Scripture to look up and chew on.This would be a good book to use for officer training, to provide a theological foundation.Similar books include Concise Theology by J.I. Packer and Salvation Belongs to the Lord by John Frame."
2,la la la,"this is ok,if your into elevator rock.Did'nt do much for me.If you likegreat rock check out chase-in pursuit."
2,Disappointing,"The text we used for our undergrad Stats class covered the exact same material as this text, which we used for a graduate level class and which cost about 60 bucks more, but the undergrad text was written more clearly, concisely and logically. We even found a mistake in one of the tables in the back of this book."
2,Poorly written freshman level probability and statistics book,"First, I cant believe that people actually used this book in a graduate class. I taught out of this book to freshmen.A lot of the notation in this book is horrible and I feel this makes it harder for people new to the subject to read. Also there are very few exercises for the students to practice. In addition, too many of the answers in the back of the book are incorrect (this really confuses students).I will not be teaching out of this book again."
1,There has to be something better.,"This was the required text for my Introduction to Probability and Statistics course. The course was a required pre-requisite for the bachelor of science nursing program. The intended membership of the course was non-math majors, ie nursing and business majors. The book was very difficult to use. There were not enough example problems nor are there enough simple english explanations. In my course evaluation at the end of the term I emphatically stated the department needed to find a new text for the course. I was very happy to sell it back. The study guide is not worth the money either. Every other odd problem is not enough to learn from."
1,Unfortunately Book Required By Professor!,"I purchased textbook because it was required by my Biostatistics professor in my graduate program. Personally, I do not like the book. It makes problems more complicated than they need to be. I feel a good textbook is one in which you can read on your own and basically understand it without a whole lot of instruction and review by your professor. It would be very difficult to just read this textbook and then take an exam. I have only had the book for several weeks and I think it makes Biostats more complicated. I did purchase the supplement that goes with it, which is good for practice and the CD allows you to take self-test. If you are not savvy in stats, purchasing the supplemental practice book may be the thing for you to do if your professor requires use of the textbook."
4,Good Straight forward book,"I took an intro graduate level stats class without any previous formal teaching of stats. This book is simple and to the point. As the title claims this is only and 'Introduction to stats', so I don't know why the other reviewers were complaining about its depth. Compared to the usual math books, this one gives good examples and shows sufficient intermediate steps."
3,Okay Until It's Not,"These measuring cups were perfect until the measurements washed off. Our family only uses environmentally friendly soaps, so we're not sure why the ""paints"" wore off, but we were extra careful to only put them on the top rack of our dishwasher. We do really like the ring around the middle that makes measuring easier with liquids. We have not had any problems with staining, but our soap (Bio-Kleen) is pretty amazing :) We did remove the ring approximately five minutes after we purchased them because it was simply too awkward to use. Our next set of cups will be metal, but for now, this set and our scale does a good job."
2,"Buy steel, not plastic","I bought these a year ago. They are already broken and the ones I have left are yellowed. The one cup measure did not hold up to scooping flour and the handle just snapped right off. I won't buy plastic again, they all seem to break. I will be buying stainless from now on."
4,Nice but not unique,"This is a very nice set of measuring cups. However, while most kitchen gadgets by OXO offer unique ergonomic design and distinctive look, this set is no different from a number of other brands that you can pick up in your supermarket for about the same price. This, of course, doesn't make it any less useful in the kitchen. I like my measuring cups and use them all the time."
5,Absolutely LOVED this!!,"Written from a young boy's perspective, filled with innocent humor...from the strange, to the shocking...What a family story! Soon, you will be remembering events from your own childhood and smile thru the tears.Overall....the cast of characters are so vivid! I pondered from time to time with crazy questions of my own. The book makes you want more, to know more, to identify!!Great one-ups!!! Frank Bosworth draws the reader in. You will find yourself cheering on the different characters. It really is a strange love/hate, laughing, crying journey!!"
5,I LAUGHED FROM BEGINNING TO END... LOVED IT!,"'..Unicorn' is a most unique autobiography of a young man's trials and tribulations growing up in a small New England town. I vascillated between laughing and crying throughout the whole book. To anyone looking for true to life writing, I highly recommend this book.As a side note to a previous review, yes, '...Unicorn' deserves a better cover, but as they say, 'you can't tell a book by its cover'. Also, I found not one instance of text running into the gutter/binding.The ending lends itself to a sequel; I can only hope. Read and enjoy"
5,Never Play Leapfrog With A Unicorn,"I loved the story ""My Lil' Black Dad"" and the rest of the book doesn't disappoint. It is funny, gut wrenching at times and extremely well done. It is a deep narrative of a not so average life."
2,False advertising,"I was looking for a funny read aloud book for 8th graders. This book is neither. It had f-bombs, sex, and was quite sad. It says you will laugh out loud...not once.The story is about a very poor boy in a small, resort town. His father is incapacitated and his mother is very abusive.Are you laughing yet?"
3,SCALE REVIEW,THIS IS AN OK SCALE FOR ITS PRICE. I CAN EVEN READ THE DIGITAL NUMBERS WITHOUT MY GLASSES. IT'S ALSO VERY THIN AND EASY TO STORE; I ALSO LIKED THAT IT CAME WITH FREE SHIPPING.
4,my 2year 7324w Scale gave a BAee display. R/R battery it works fine now,"""bAEE"" the top horizantle line if the E is omitted. I emailed ""info_(at)_TAYLORUSA_com"" and this reply Your scale is indicating that it needs a battery (batt is the display).Be sure that you have used a fresh battery and that it is placedcorrectly in the compartment. If this is a lithium battery be sure thepositive side is up and that it is making good contact inside thecompartment.Please let us know if this does not help.Regards,Linda DLTConsumer RelationsTaylor Precision Products& Salter Housewares2220 Entrada del Sol, Suite ALas Cruces, NM 88001Toll free - 800-289-0944866-843-3905Direct - 575-526-0944 ext 3172"
1,Good for 1 year,"We have owned this scale for about 1 year. Worked OK for that time. I have noticed the ""repeats your last weight"" thing that it does. Now it will not settle on a weight, and then gives the ""bree"" error code. Just try to find out what ""bree"" means! The Taylor web site is worthless. Stay away from this scale."
2,How much do I weigh?!,I bought this scale in July '07 and at first it was working fine. Now the numbers on the scale change from one minute to the next. I weighed myself before writing this review and weighed 125 then weighed myself 2 minutes later to check again for accuracy and weighed 127. My husband weighs himself and the same thing happens. Sorry but this product does not work properly.
2,Is This Scale Accurate?,I get different readings that can vary by 5 pounds just by stepping on and off this scale.
5,Great Bargain,Great bargain and very accurate. Always gives me the same weight twice in a row. Best scale I've owned.
5,Smart-looking scale,Pretty scale with nice slim profile. I just wish it wasn't so darn accurate! ;-)
3,not very happy,"Unfortunately this scale is not what I expected. I seem to have to step on and off the scale a few times before it registers and then shows the weight. If you move it for any reason, then it has to be reset. I am very dissappointed actually. The accuracy seems fine but the act of weighing myself is not as easy as it should be or has been with previous scales."
1,Deceptive pseudo-repeatability,"When I weigh myself twice in a row, it gives the same reading...to 0.1 lbs! That is not accuracy, however; it's clearly a case of the instrument remembering the last reading and repeating it if the next reading is close. For example, if I weigh myself, then someone else weighs themself, then I weigh myself a second time, the second weighing can be quite different from the first weighing. It's commonly shifts by about 1 pound. If I weigh myself twice in a row, without someone else weighing themselves, then it returns to the previous value *exactly*.It's one thing for a bathroom scale to be somewhat inaccurate. It's quite another when the company programs the chip to repeat the last reading in order to fake accuracy that doesn't exist!It's being returned to seller, and I won't touch another Taylor product."
2,Accuracy?,"I have a problem with this scales accuracy. It seems to save your weight from the last time you weighed yourself. Very frustrating to someone who has been losing weight and wants to see progress. Every morning we play the same game. Step on, see yesterdays weight. Step off. Repeat x number of times. Step on with weights to ""clear"" the weight from yesterday. Step on and off. Repeat. Decide which weight might be right.The only reason I am not giving it 1 star is because I have had worse scales."
5,Didn't have to read it to love it!,"I bought this book for my daughter, who is in middle school. She chose to read it for one of our frequent ""sit under a shade tree and read"" sessions. I can't remember what book I picked, because I didn't get to read it. Roughly every two minutes, my daughter would interrupt our normally quiet time with, ""Oh, you gotta hear this..."" before long, I put aside my book and just listened. She enjoyed the book so much that she couldn't keep it to herself, she simply had to share it."
2,Urgh!,"I found this at my local library, and I'm so glad I decided to test the series that way before buying it. I have never read a book with a more insulting protagonist! Honestly, Jennifer Scales has zero personality outside of being a whiny, spoiled brat. She spends the first part of the book (before her ""transformation"") yelling at all of her friends and saying downright-cruel things to her mother. It was a wonder that everyone hasn't abandoned her yet--how can she have friends?! I crossed my fingers that she would redeem herself by the end...but I just couldn't finish it. I got about 50 pages in before I no longer cared about anything I was reading. And by the look of other reviews, I'm not missing anything."
3,Looks good but cheaply built,"From the picture you would expect a heavy, solid piece of metal. Unfortunately this is a light piece of metal with a nice polish. It still looks good, and does a good job holding 3 cigars. A good value for the price, but it still is a low end cigar ashtray."
4,Measuring Spoons,"I really like the spoons, but I don't like the piece that clips them together. It's difficult to open the clip to separate the spoons."
2,"Useful, but doesn't hold up.","I bought these spoons having bought a black version of them years ago. Loved them. However, over time, they broke for various reasons (i.e., got trashed in the garbage disposal). I needed a new full set so I thought to get these. Sadly, I'm quite disappointed because the markings, that tell you the measurements, have slowly been rubbing off. So much that I can't read it on some of them and have resorted to giving them to my kids to add to their play kitchen stuff. I never put them in the dishwasher either. I always hand washed them. The spoons themselves are great but I'm surprised that whatever material is used to show the measurements is so cheap. I've since gotten metal ones where the markings are etched in. Can't say I'd recommend anyone buying them unless you use them infrequently."
5,The Gurus of the Working From Home Revolution Strike Again!,"Paul and Sarah Edwards founded the Working From Home Forum on CompuServe back in 1983 (that's 20 years ago, folks!) and they have been going strong ever since! Not only were they the first to spell out the necessary steps to start and run your own home business, but they have also proven to be the far and away leading mentors in pursuing a dream to become your own boss. They meticulously detail steps you need to take, questions to honestly ask yourself, and strategies to ensure your success. And, as with every book they have written, they include many interviews with people who have gone through the rigors of self-employment and pass along advice to those just starting out.If you are serious about finding out if you can make it on your own, then this is the book to start with!"
1,Not Worth the Time,"I read this book for a book club I belong too. WOW, what a waste of time! The characters are flat, the writing less than mediocre and nothing draws you into the story line. Ghandi is not in the book as the title would suggest, in fact you don't learn anything about Ghandi fact or fiction. The author wants me to feel things and you know this throughout reading the book, but unfortunately his writing doesn't make or allow you to feel it. Oh it was 1 of the worst books I have ever read."
2,good dvd but,"I bought this dvd because of the high rating it received in modern drummer magazine. I was really disappointed with the content. I am assuming that this was based on a clinic he may have been giving with some performances mixed in. The dvd really was not edited well and seems to jump around. For example I would be getting into a concept he was talking about then it jumps to him performing with a bass player which has no connection to the concept he was talking about. As an experienced drummer we all should have internal clocks to help us count, help with the groove and, to keep the music going he really is not covering anything new or unknown. There are some morsels of knowledge but I am actually shocked that this is highly rated for anyone other than a beginner."
1,Lousy DVD,"This is an hour and a half of Billy listening to himself talk. You won't find any good ideas, exercises or even captivating soloing here; it's just boring, pompous monologue. I recommend instructional videos by Thomas Lang, his are filled with good exercises."
1,Extremely disappointed!,"I am very, very disappointed with this product. Size is inaccurate...way too small for a size large. They are cheap feeling and looking. The fingers are too short. I do not recommend these gloves."
2,a painful read,"I'm a huge fan of forgotten realms books, but this is possibly one of the worst I have read. This book is extremely unrealistic (If that is possible for DnD) Arilyn, the main character, is possibly the lamest character in all of faerun. (Matching an elven weaponmaster in battle at about the age of 10???) Although it is nice to see someone besides the master R.A. Salvatore write a story with an elf as the main charater. Danilo on the other hand is a fairly well made character. But his true potential as a character is never seen as Cunningham keeps him as somewhat of a comedy relief. Like the title says, a very painful read."
5,"Assasins,Intrigue,Love,Valor what else could you want?","This book is the first of a great series by E. Cunningham.The characters are so well formed that you feel you're right there with them.The series spans 4 books ELFSHADOW,ELFSONG,SILVER SHADOWS,& The DREAM SPHERES.The characters grow & learn more about themselves as you do.This is one of the best series I have read,& I've never seen a story unfold & evolve better than this one.."
4,a fun Forgotten Realms book,"Normally I hate tie-ins for rpg's and so on; most of them are awful. But Cunningham's one of the (few) exceptions. Here she sets up an interesting mystery about a half-elf and her mystical sword, not to mention the tangled (and trying!) relationships between Arilyn (the half-elf) and the apparent wastrel, Danilo Thann of Waterdeep. My only complaint was the culprit's motives--seemed a bit too tied to the AD&D alignment system, and wasn't entirely convincing. But worth a look."
3,"Just Right, at first","You can't beat this for the price. I got it to replace my Mercer 9"" Chef, which is a very serious blade, just not my cup of tea. I really prefer the Santoku knife, and love my Mercer Genesis knife kit which this matches. As a culinary student, I can say with certainty that I would not have passed my knife skills practical exam without this baby. Its my go-to axe until further notice, or until I can afford a Global or a Shun.An update to this is that after 8 weeks of light to moderate use in culinary college, the blade is pitted badly, from some unknown metal to metal contact. This shouldn't happen to a brand new knife which has not been abused, and has always been washed by itself. I will attempt to return to Mercer and see what happens."
4,Great knife,I just bought this knife based on various internet reviews. It has a very nice feel (pretty heavy) and cuts very well. Well worth the $40!
1,Complete garbage,This book skips so many intermediate steps that it is not suitable for beginners. It also assumes that the reader is already familiar with the adventure works data warehouse schema. It fails to give beginners enough background to be a useful learning tool.
1,Very Bad Purchase,"This book has a lot of problems. It skips many intermediate steps that even a mid-level developer would probably need. I looked at these comments prior to purchasing the book, but thought these people are probably really good programmers that already *know it all* and are being way too critical. I can say that wasn't the case at all, and they were right on. I believe this book was put together very poorly and Mark Robinson could have done a much better job in explaining these intermediate steps that can make all the difference in the world. (VERY LAZY INSTRUCTIONS) As many of you may know, when you miss just 1 step, it can make all the difference in the world. (START WANTING TO PULL YOUR HAIR OUT) If you want a book that shows you step by step instructions and actually explains essential functionality, I wouldn't recommend this particular book."
1,Refers to the wrong figures,"The book is poorly written and VERY poorly proofread. I don't think they even proofread the book whatsoever. One tiny example: Turn to page 122 and on step 11, it states to refer to Figure 7-2 for the final report you created.....umm...the image does not show that, it shows something completely different. This is just 1 example that as we speak, I found. Microsoft does a MUCH better job in their Step by Step books. This book should be called SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services WRITTEN BY Dummies."
5,Brilliant !!!,"Wow, I've ordered a lot of stuff off Amazon over the last year and this is definatly one of the best purchases so far. Solid construction, good size, exactly as advertised...and god damned cheap to boot :oP thanks so much for this wonderful product.... Gotta say it arrived a hell of a lot faster than I expected too. A great purchase I fully recommend if you need a case for your digital keyboard especially when traveling. 10/10"
2,SKB keyboard case,"Wheels are in a cheap plastic housing, one of which shattered after rolling less than 100 feet. SKB hustled out a pair of replacements--but the wrong type. I left a message to explain which type I needed but no response after a week. The case itself is OK, not especially heavy duty, but decent enough for the gig a month or so I do. It is larger than I needed, but the extra storage is welcome. The handles and locks are good, and the padding adequate. I say upgrade the housing and it's a 3 star plus case."
1,How do I return?,"Maybe it said it in the description, so maybe it's my fault but I can't play the dvds because they're from the UK. How do I return??? I bought two of them....Kacey"
1,High Quality Paperback Book,"I bought this book based on the notation that it was a high-quality paperback book. The book had six or seven pages that looked like they had been written on a typewriter. Then, there were pages and pages of blank paper (probably at least 20 blank pages). This is not what I call a high-quality paperback book. I was going to use it with my class at school, but I just brought it back home instead of using it.The Cask of Amontillado"
2,THIS STORY WAS VERY COFUSING.,I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THIS BOOK AT ALL. THEY NEED TO HAVE LITTLER NAMES LIKE BOB AND FRED. INSTEAD OF ALL THESE CONFUSING ONES!I FINALY GOT THIS BOOK WHENEVER MY TEACHER EXPLAINED TO ME.
5,A well down brief history.,"This small book is loaded with great illustrations and information. For the casual reader of history, this would be a quick read and good reference to keep. I cannot attest to its authenticity, but feel comfortable in quoting from it."
3,I have mixed feelings about this book.,"I perused this book carefully because I want information on diet and FMS. There are good definitions of FMS, but the info and recipes seem to be geared toward reducing the ""inflamation"" of arthritis. As I understand it, FMS is not a condition of inflamation. Thus, my confusion. For forms of inflamatory arthritis conditions it looks excellent. I'd like to note that I have seen other books that tag FMS on to Arthritis in their titles or covers and don't seem to have much specific to FMS. A selling technique, I suppose. This book is attractive and seems very good for arthritis, but not specific for FMS."
5,Great Self-Teaching Guide,"This book, long a standard, is well-organized, clear, concise, accurate, and inexpensive. It covers all of the basic measures associated with mortality and fertility. It shows formulas and example calculations and is ideal as a self-teaching guide, textbook, and reference tool. A must for any would-be demographer."
3,Still waiting.......,Friends is a great show. But i have be impatiently waiting for the last 2 seasons to come out. Season 9 AND season 10 have been released in UK and Australia! Why do we have to wait so long here in the states? Its not right.
5,Classic Show,"I bought this for my sister, but we watched it together. What can I say? More classic friends. This is a pretty decent season. The writing is very witty."
1,Thank god its finished,"I really do hate this kind of tripe...from the over acting (you can't say any of these people are good actors, you name me one good thing they have done before or since this series)...the series set up (they all in live a rather expensive flat in NY while all working for peanuts !)...oh its set in NY and there is no black people in it !!!!!..oh please !And the major thing for me...ITS NOT FUNNYI do wish they would stop repeating it on tv ITS FINISHED (thank god)"
4,The Ninth Feast Of Friends,"After the great eighth season,Season Nine of Friends was originally suppose to be the final season,but was extended for another.The season dealt with Ross and Rachel's new role as parents to baby Emma,Chandler and Monica's attempt to have their own, Phoebe meeting her soon to be husband Mike (Paul Rudd),and Joey dealing with his feelings for Rachel.The classic episodes include The One With-Where No One Proposes,...Phoebe's Birthday Dinner,...Rachel's Other Sister(with Christina Applegate),...The Lottery,...,In Barbados (featuring Aisha Tyler as Charlie).Towards the end of the season,it set in motion events that would lead to the finale."
5,Love Friends,I bought this for my daughter because she is crazy about Friends and is collecting all of the seasons. The DVD's work and the show is great so great buy!
5,The best TV comedy of the 1990's,"Friends is the best comedy show of the 1990's, and they really make laugh with very smart and sane comedy and the actors and actresses were very good chosen, they really make a great job, and I think this is the best season and the very last episode is very funny too, and at the same time, very sad, and the way they mixed it all up is very good and they desserve a lot of prizes for this work they have done, and now, it's done."
5,Fantastic reference,"This book is the best reference work I have ever used for research. The bibliography cannot be improved upon and the text provides the most up-to-date summary on this fascinating subject. Another reviewer said the book was dull. It is not meant to be a history book on the colonies. For this type of thing, try Dunbabin's ""The first western Greeks."" This book is an archaeological reference, not a overview of classical history of the colonies, although it does refer to history where relevant. I have had this book for four years and have used it countless times. Boardman's work is always outstanding."
1,"So difficult, it hurts.","There was a time when there were applications, like PageMill, for people who needed a nice looking website but not every feature, option, protocol known to man. But now its pretty much all or nothing and GoLive gives you everything except ease of use, along with a host of non-intuitive icons to keep you guessing. To be fair, most of these exotic features, which used to crash everyone's browser can now be made to work--if you are a professional web designer. Then again, companies like Amazon and eBay seem to get by with simple websites so maybe there's a market for web software that just does the basics.After stacks of books, a $400 class and finally an Adobe support contract, I've gotten a decent website out of GoLive. But I dread making changes to the site because I can always count on GoLive to throw new obstacles in my way."
2,Eh...,"This book really didn't accomplish what it set out to do. It started off with the claim that the reader will not only read faster, but that reading comprehension will increase. The only real speed reading excercises are for viewing (not reading, as the book says) large chunks of text quickly. But it ends there. There are no tips about comprehending material while viewing it quickly. There are tips for memory retention and classic conditiong for relaxation (both of which you can find in an Intro to Psych class), as well as smart ways of how to read texts (look at charts, topic sentences, etc...), but nothing about understanding the chunks of text we are ""viewing"" quickly. I admit that after doing these dizzying excercises, my regular reading for comprehension increased in speed a little bit. However, it is still not up to the rate I would consider ""speed reading.""Final Verdict: If you really want it, check it out at the library or buy it used. But look for a better book first."
1,Disappointing,"This book is a real disappointment. There's very little actual helpful material to improve your reading speed. Moreover, it hardly covers sub-vocalization, which is a mayor factor inhibiting your readingspeed. The hand exercises are silly and will not increase your speed. A large and useless part of the book only covers texts for practising, like you can't practise on any other texts... Buy another book."
4,What a surprise,"After ordering this book I let it sit around for several months before getting to it. I was not expecting much at all. I had some free time this morning and read the whole thing. My reading has gone from 200 words per minute to about 800 in just a few hours. I am quite impressed. I have now been reading all day. The more I practice the techniques in this book the faster I read. This is after just a few hours! More importantly, I am now comprehending and retaining printed material much better. A great book for the price."
5,Wow,"Wow, it's amazing how much this book will help you improve your reading time. I can't believe I've been reading word by word my whole life when i could be reading huge blocks-and comprehend everything!"
2,Runs VERY small.,"Purchased for a friend who wears an XL in everything else without a problem, had to return the shirt, it barely came close to fitting. Make sure you order at least 1 size up!"
2,Read before buying!!!,"This shirt is great dont get me wrong, however i ordered a large which is my size and this is extremley tight on me...so if youre gonna order it, be sure to purchase a size up from what you usually order"
1,Not a happy camper,"I need to make LOTS of charts in graphs in the next several months. I am a total retard when it comes to MS Excel. I thought I'd pick up this one because it said EZ all over it. Well, low and behold, this program makes Excel look like paint by numbers. This program is VERY complicated and the help (as most help is) is USELESS..it tells you WHAT to do, but not HOW to do it. I needed a program that had wizards or at least retard instructions, but this one is NOT the one! Guess I'm screwed outta my money cuz I can't return it. So much for my first online software purchase, NEVER again!"
1,Won't maintain vacuum,"My wife and daughter both bought these bags. None of them will maintain vacuum for more than a day. If all you want is a big ziplock bag they are OK, but if used as space savers as advertised, they are useless."
2,Not impressed!,"I have had trouble with these bags staying sealed. I have done all I can do to try to make sure seal is tight and done correctly. These may work well for puffy/light things like blankets and pillows but I have not found them to be much help with clothes. They really don't save 75% of space and I find half of the ones I have bought to lose their seal on a consistent basis. The large ziploc bags can do just as good of job protecting your items. Also, things do not vacuum down perfectly like the picture on the box. You have to put just a few items in and make sure they are stacked perfectly to achieve this. You get nothing like the picture if you fill bag to the capacity line before vacuuming. You also get a lumpy, not very stackable final result."
3,quality questionable,"Great idea, but some of the bags, I bought 3 sets, had pin holes where they had been folded."
3,try this instead,"Space bags rip sometimes, try this...Get a trash compactor bag or thick trash bag and a thick, heavy duty rubber band. Put your item in the bag and close the bag with the rubber band circled fairly tight (double or quadruple if necessary) around your bag opening scrunched up around your vacuum hose. It will work the same way as the space bags. The only difference is that there is no one way valve.When your item is compressed, you have to twist the bag closed tightly below the vacuum nozzle and slide the rubber band over it and tighten the rubber band more in order to make the bag air tight. It takes a little maneuvering to make sure the bag gets sealed off as you pull the vacuum nozzle out, but it only took me a second try to get the hang of it and I'm not especially strong. It works great."
1,Space Bags Suck,"What a waste of money. You spend all your time arranging clothes in the bags, suck out the air and are amazed at how much space they save; only to find the next morning that the vacuum seal does not work. I bought a whole box of these and not one bag held the vacuum for more than two days. BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,space bags,"I could not even place 2 blankets into a ""large""size space bag, I would have to use a super large bag, these bags might be suitable to store baby clothes in. I amd not saying the product is bad, just that the bags to me are useless."
1,Big disappointment,The space bags seem to be a great concept but the products need further development. The bags start out compress and small but re-inflated after only a few days.
2,Don't expect a second use out of them!,"I loved these bags at first. I rated them a ""2"" because with the first use, they work great. After that, though, it's a crap shoot if it'll work again. They seem to be too rigid in that when the vacuum seal is used, the bag compresses and sometimes can create folds that break open rendering the seal useless for multiple uses. I do use the bags again to store items, but can't vacuum seal and compress, so they're basically expensive plastic bags. If you only need them for 1 season or just one long-term use, then buy them, but don't expect them to keep working after the bag is reinflated. Some do work a second time, but I've never had a bag do three rounds of duty. I've bought the multi-pack and the cubes, and both have had the same issues."
1,Cheap product. Falls apart after a couple of uses. Zip seal is very weak.,"We have had these space bags for a year. The zipper is cheap and does not seal well, the plastic on the vacuum nozzle comes off readily, and the plastic gets brittle and tears easily. Take it from a year of experience, this brand of vacuum bags has been nothing but bad news."
1,Do Not Buy,"These bags don't work. I bought a box over a year ago. All but one the air came out. I recently bought a box that said ""New and Improved"".They sure did not improve anything. My new motto is ""If it is advertised on TV - don't buy it"". Fortunately the new box I bought I can return since I purchased them locally"
1,Bags reinflate,"I thought this would be a great product when i saw the infomercial. In fact I regret ever buying it. The bags reinflate in a matter of days. the first set I bought did that, and i thought it was me not doing it properly. Then I bought a second set with the same problem (bags reinflate and tear very easily). the worse is that space bag does not stand behind its product. it will cost me more than the product is worth to send it back, just to have them replace (no refund). Please don't buy these space bags."
1,Do not buy Space Bags!,"These bags are horrible! We bought them after the Today Show recommended them. The first bag my husband completely ripped the zipper off because the plastic was so thin. Cereal bags are less fragile! Then after filling and vacuuming, everything seemed ok, but the seal lasted just a few days. We tried zipping and vacuuming again, but no luck. A total waste of money."
1,Create your own Space Bags!,"If these bags don't hold air, as advertised, then do as I do and create your own. I use extra heavy garbage bags and suck out the air with my vacumn cleaner. Twist and tie the end with a tight string or rope. The problem I have is that if I don't get the tie really tight the air SLOWLY leaks out. I had considered buying Space Bags because I thought they would NOT leak. However, it sounds as though some of these bags leak faster than my own garbage bags. In that case, I will just keep using my own method."
1,Space Bags,"I really needed these bags to work because I have a small house with little storage space. I was so excited when I got these and I used a large bag for a comforter that my husband refuses to give up.At first, after I carefully folded and placed the conforter in the bag, sealed the bag and vacuumed the air out, we were amazed at how compact the comforter became! I read the reviews and noticed only a handful of positive reviewers that stated that the negative reviewers had not used the bags properly and I thought they were right because I had used mine properly and it worked!Well, as soon as I picked the bag off of the ground, carefully, the seal was undone and the bag was full of air.Excellent concept, but these bags do not work; at least they did not for me!"
1,Shoddy merchandise,"My wife and I bought 2 sets. Only two of the bags kept the vacuum seal. The rest either leaked, or worse yet, split apart. These cheap things split under the zip lock seal, despite having a reasonable amount of clothing inside. Good idea, but terrible quality. Plastic is so cheap, it makes me wonder why they didn't bother to make the things a little thicker. I hope a word to the wise is sufficient in this case. I'd hate to see anyone else waste money on this product without being warned off."
1,"Heavy Duty Contractor Trash Bags ""Just as Good""","Space bags are cheaply made, if your not careful you'll rip the seams out of them, but even if you are careful the bag will not keep air out for very long. Air like water is nearly impossible to keep out of anything that it surrounds so if your looking for ""space saving"" get a box of Contractor's Heavy Duty Trash Bags and fold your items placing them into the bag, gather the bag around the vacuum cleaner hose, when the air is removed tie a knot in the bag. Like the Space Bag the air will leak back into the Contractor's bag but the knot and the seams will hold, you've gained space and it cost you about a quarter."
4,works as expected,"As long as you keep the items below the fill line, it works as advertised. It's fun to jam a lot more into a box than you'd be able to."
2,"Great idea, if only it worked!","I'm in the same boat as many other posters: My bags re-flated. It was kind of funny actually. I'm a bit of a comforter-junkie - have lots of king-sized ones. So, I put them all in space bags and lo' and behold my linen closet looked just like the ones pictured in the Space Bag ads! Until the next week, that is. The sight when I opened that door was unbelievable!!! I had such a hard time getting those things out of the 24-inch doorway, I couldn't help but laugh. Needless to say, the bags ended up torn and ruined. Maybe the small bags work better, but I would definitely recommend that you avoid the large ones!!"
2,"If you want a giant, one-zip bag,","then the Space Bag is for you.I highly do not recommend this item for its intended purpose of staying vacuum sealed since it does not. I filled the bag to its ""do not exceed"" line and vacuumed the air. The bag compressed, but after a few hours the bag started to fill with air, again.Pretty much, the bag is like a jumbo, one-zip bag. It's good for putting stuff in it, sitting on top of it to deflate it, and zipping it up for environmental protection.Oh, and the ""zipper"" slider, which has to be slided twice for ""sealing"" the bag, can cut the bag if placed too low along the grooves. Just a bit of info in case you still want to buy the Space Bag.I won't say that I won't ever buy this product again, but I highly doubt that I would. I think I would buy garbage bags and knot their ends, instead."
2,Save your money,"I purchased the Space Bags, and as others have stated, you need to be careful when using them or they will tear. If you manage to fill all the bags while keeping them intact, you'll be lucky if you get more than one season out of them. Otherwise, they become just like any other storage bag, only less durable. My advice: save your money."
1,Forget these!,"I can't believe these are still on the market. How does a product with perhaps a 90% failure rate continue to sell? Seriously.Against my better judgement, I bought the new and improved Space Bags after having had a 100% failure rate years ago with these -- vacuum the air out, put them aside, come back an hour later and they are re-inflated.Nothing has changed. Same failure rate. Frustrating! Isn't there a watchdog agency that's supposed to protect consumers against fraud? Where are they? Or maybe it's just that you can't break the laws of physics -- Nature abhors a vacuum and will do everything it can to intercede.Bottom line, don't waste your time with these."
4,A friendly read for readers who like history and warfare!,"This is a terrific book based on content of the material that was researched and presented. However, I am a really big historical and warfare type of reader, and this book I think lacks some depth in the military campaign section such as graphs and maps in describing the different engagements during the entire war. If you are a reader who had never read anything on the Korean War (like me), I think this book provides a well-rounded knowledge in history, military perspectives, relationships between generals and to their supperiors such as General MacArthur and President Truman, and above all, politics within the U.S. and the world. I think the book was factual and unbiased in its views, and is not written from an ""American"" point of view, but stating what had took place as the way it happened."
2,Video is in SD - no HD,"I downloaded this for the PC to display on my 40"" TV via HDMI. Video quality is horrible looks fuzzy like SD content.Love the show bad video quality."
2,Love Doris but disappointed-stopped wrkg after 15 min,"This DVD stopped working after 15 minutes and I was pretty upset. Would like to know what I can do about it. I love Doris Day, that's why I ordered so many. Can you help?"
3,Good read with a depth of character,"This is the second book I've read by this author and I'll have to say, I will continue to look for her books. The storyline moves at a good pace but what sets her apart is the ability to bring a depth to her characters. Her characterization reminds me a little of Judith McNaught's great skill in creating a good story. Guhrke's characters are less than perfect, with a depth of personality and a believable love story. The chemistry is very good. Chemistry between characters whether in a book or on the film has got to be there for me to enjoy it. Plus, she brings in a few social concerns in a subtle way that is acceptable and adds to the story rather than detracts from it. You'll be pleased with this purchase. This storyline is part of series: ""Marriage Bed"" tells the story about his sister Viola and the title ""In his Kiss"" is about the duke's friend Dylan."
4,Enjoyable Romance,"Daphe is a 24 year old woman who had spent her life working with her archeologist father. When he dies, she is left with almost nothing. Her mother's family does not acknowldge her because her parents eloped and were not a suitable match. She returns to England to work with the Duke of Tremore in her fathers place and the romance begins. She hides behinda prim exterior. They both come from parents who were deeply in love and are afraid to love that deeply themselves. It was an enjoyable read. The characters were likeable and bright. Worth my time."
1,Eh?,"Guess I was a little disappointed in the book. Read the description on the back, thought to take a chance. The book was tedious for the first 200 pages, from crushes to the temptation of rain to just being a teaser from both of the main characters. Then after the grand passion, the flower flirtation, dances and the rumour mill was a little tedious at times. Sorry, just couldn't dance to it."
1,YOU ARE NOT JANE AUSTIN!!!,"This author has tried to Write characters like Mr. Darcy (Duke Tremore) and Elizabeth (Daphne Wade)it went all wrong the Duke comes off as being WHIMPISH AND WHINNY and Daphne comes off as being Arrogant Stubborn and is described as Plain and Poor and He is described as being very Powerful Rich and Handsome Duke. The Roles should be reversed. The two personalities just don't work and the wording is simiular to Jane Austins Pride and Prejudice. Sorry the whole concept of this book didn't work. Even though this book is fiction, it should have had some accuracy and real factual bases and a DUKE OF THAT PERIOD JUST WOULD NOT ACT LIKE THAT!!!!"
4,Background,"This is a great inexpensive background stand. It is flexible and versital. Easy to setup and configure. It has a weakness in the the tightening screws too much force and they break. The lightweight frame can make setting up larger backdrops difficult as they will fall.For the cost, the difficulties are easily overcome.I use this stand with 8x8, 10x10 and 10x20 backdrops. The stand does a great job."
4,Great Starter Stand,"The stand is a little wobbly but for a starter set it's perfect. Adjusting the height is easy and the carrying case is great. If you don't have clips, you'll need to purchase some as they don't come with the kit."
4,still going strong,I bought this a few years (in 2009).. its not 2013.. and its still in pretty good shape! Super light and easy to fold was serioulsy a good buy !
1,Returned immediately,"I had some problems with this. The clips are very cheap and were broken during (or before) transit. I returned it -- or at least tried to since the seller wouldn't respond. Eventually, I had to file a claim/complaint with Amazon before the vendor would write back.Lesson learned."
3,Informative but repeative..,"Dr. Acquista's book on Emergency Prep for bio, chem or nuke attack is through enough to be useful, however a lot of the material repeats itself. Reference use only."
2,Nothing new here,Disappointed! There is nothing new in this book that I haven't seen on T.V. or elsewhere. Warmed over advice.
5,Essential reading,"Given the current state of affairs, I would advise everyone to buy this book or something similar.It effectively outlines procedures that we should all be aware of in the case of specific attacks such as:Botox Attacks, Anthrax Concerts, Chicken Pox Weapons, and Weapons of Mass Distraction.I for one will be sealing up my windows with velvet, destroying my microwave, and covering my children with maple syrup."
5,Astonishing,"This CD really surprised me. I knew the Busoni and Brahms pieces well but this is the best rendition I've ever heard of them. Little by little you enter the eye of the storm, everything whirling around you. The Lutz was also interesting. What I found most amazing was the completely different sound Edna Stern gives to each piece. You can really feel the tension between the time of Bach, of the transcription, and nowadays; especially in the Brahms.There is really something special in her way of producing sound.I also found the baroque violin rendition of the original Bach brilliant. Completely different than Milstein (or Perlman) it has a special character. Quite majestic."
5,Great Game,"Holy good,never played a better game.It's Great.Choose your own Turtle and take over. Fight Enemies that go boom.Cowabunga"
1,"ugly sweaters, but nice format","The idea of having the patterns on laminated cards is a great one. It is just TOO BAD that all the patterns are designed by Matthay. Her sweaters are generally ugly and reliant on weird novelty yarns. I didn't find a single nice-looking pattern in the whole lot. Also, all the patterns are sort of quick-knit, beginnerish sorts of things, which don't present any challenges and won't look particularly nice when they are done. Don't buy this just because the format seems nice! Buy a decent pattern book and just xerox and laminate the pattern you want to use."
2,for the lids,"I was looking for stainless steel mixing bowls which could be heated while whisking. I also really liked the idea of using lids instead of wasting plastic wrap. The bowls work well enough for mixing, and have volume markings indented into the sides of the bowl in cups and milliliters. The lids however work horribly for keeping the food sealed. The curvature of the bowl seems to cause them to push out. For that reason, the bowls aren't what I was hoping for."
3,pretty good,"I put these on my wish list and go them as a gift, so I can't comment on the shipping. The bowls are fine, but the lids do not seal. They just rest in place. If you are trying to protect from spills or odors or preserve freshness, you are out of luck. I would suggest just getting regular mixing bowls without lids."
2,The lids smell horrible...,"i haven't even used the bowls yet, but the smell that came off those lids when I opened the package is absolutely horrible. They are currently in the dishwasher and I will update after use. I'm already regretting this purchase though."
1,Lids don't fit,"I was so excited about these bowls when I found them online. I got them as a Christmas gift and THE LIDS DO NOT FIT, irregardless of what other reviews may say (unless they've since fixed their product). It's not just that the lids aren't snug - they don't fit at all. It would be the equivalent of setting an awkward-shaped plate on top of your mixing bowl to store food in the fridge. I've been meaning to write a review for almost a year to warn others.If you care about the lids, find another product. I know I'm going to have to."
1,Pure and simple....lids don't fit!,"Pure and simple....the lids of these ""stainless steel"" mixing bowls don't fit. And what is worse is that Tovolo won't stand behind their product. When I contacted them 3 weeks after I purchased the bowls, they said I would have to take it up with the retailer I purchased them from. Don't buy them! The small bowl already shows signs of pitting on the inside, which will eventually turn to rust. Disappointing product."
2,Lids aren't lids,"I ordered these bowls specifically because they had lids, but what I got were some great stainless bowls with lids that are worthless. The lids simply don't fit on these bowls. You can't possibly get them to fit, they are too small for the bowls. I thought I was dumb and just tried them again the next day and they still didn't fit. So now I have 3 great stainless bowls without lids. Thank god for Saran Wrap."
2,Lids are useless,"I was given these as a Christmas gift two years ago. The lids don't fit unless I'm steaming a roasted pepper. A bowl is a bowl but they are flat bottomed with a groove that can make it hard to properly mix stuff. They do have measurements on the inside, however, that are helpful."
4,work fine for me,"These bowl work great for us. I noticed that others seem to have issues with the lids smelling, though I have not personally noticed this myself (thats not to say it won't happen, but for now mine are fine). The bowls are great and I love the indentations for measurement. The lids do not fit extremely tight, but I also don't really store them with a need for the seal to be airtight. So all in all they work great for me."
1,Nightline Ghost Hunters: Not Worth the Money,"I bought this dvd thinking it would be an hour of Ghost Hunting. What I got was about thirty minutes of a group that seemed to be less organized than they should be, and so many in a room that you could not determine too well what was going on in the investigation. After all that, little evidence was shown.I am not thrilled with this dvd and wouldn't advise purchasing it due to length."
3,Maison Jennie,"Please, I realy need analysis, theme, plot, and character of Maison Jennie by Julie Ellis. Thank's to anybody who wants to send me a data! (sorry,if my English not to good)"
4,Where's the FULL recording?,"I use to borrow this from our local library -- and always returned it too late. One of my favorites of the ""old-style"" Messiahs. My only wish is that Decca would re-release the ENTIRE recording on CD -- not just arias and choruses."
3,"Good performances, mediocre sound quality","The remastering of this CD was not top notch. The sound quality is far inferior to my DDD from Hyperion starring Lynn Dawson,Katherine James et al.But I'm still looking for the perfect Messiah recording."
5,Grips you by the throat and won&#65533;t let you go . . .,"A rollicking good read that puts you in the center of the storm from page one, and never quite lets up until the surprising ending. Perfect for fans of fiction that reads like nonfiction, or lovers of documentary films who like to be put right in the middle of the action. Meckel's crisp, unforgiving prose makes you feel wet from all the pounding rain and flooding waters, and her atmospheric settings made even this Florida native shiver from the cold during those long, balmy nights. I look forward to more from author Wendy Lea Meckel's realistic fiction in the future . . ."
3,Magnificent Music Missing Melody,"Der Ferne Klang is my second exposure to the music of Franz Schreker, the first being his Chamber Symphony. My libretto is German only and since I do not know this language I was unable to appreciate the interplay of text and music. I loved the different orchestrations achieved by this composer. He gets a great deal from the various instruments, at times simply wonderous orchestral coloration. There were moments during the opera (I have now heard it twice) when it seemed as if it were an exercise (and a mighty good one at that) for a master class in orchestration. Yet, when it is over, nothing remains for me except this amorphous annal of arresting music. I think I am rather like Fritz, searching for a sound - in my case - a memorable melody. Alas, I did not find one."
1,I didn't like what I got . . .,"This software is one of the worst things I bought last year. I tried to use it. It must be registered by phone or mail, internet is not an option. I called to register and got an answering machine with another number. I called there and spoke to a live operater who told me I had purchased the bottom end package and would I like to upgrade for $100.00. ""NO"" said I. He told me I would never be able to update my tax tables unless I paid for the upgrade. The software came with the 1998-1999 tax tables, I bought it in 2000. Not very useful for payroll in 2001."
1,Barely adequate basic program,"The basic EZ payroll program will calculate the amount of paychecks but that's about it; some reporting functions are there but are difficult to get adequate results with. Most irritating is the fact that many of the functions that the program ought to perform are not available on the basic version; you have to buy the upgrade to get them. As a result, much of the payroll information is ""hidden"" once it enters the program; the buttons for accessing it are mentioned in the ""help"" windows, but don't exist on the basic version. In my opinion the inexpensive basic version is little more than a come-on to hook you into buying the expensive upgrade. They should certainly mention that fact prominently in the ads."
1,Software comes with 2001 tax tables!!!!!!!!,"My copy of this software came with outdated tax table information! It will be returned faster than I can say ""JUNK""! It turns out that the tax tables for year 2001 came with the software and to upgrade you have to pay more money. Essentially, you cannot use the software as it's provided to calculate any withholding for the current year! Save your money and time - buy another payroll program."
5,great little stuffed animal!,My grandson really loved his doggie. Thanks so much for a wonderful price and good deal! Nice quality product for sure!
1,Gately's results are very misleading,"The reviewer that wrote the poor and misleading review described the book perfectly.In a 4 page passage of the book I found at least 10 errors involving contradictions between text, tables and figures. This becomes very frustrating if you are trying to reproduce the results Gately achieved--a task I have found impossible.Gately also claims great success however he does not test his neural nets on a validation set of data. This is a fatal error in real trading. It is therefor impossible to determine if he was successful at all.It is clear that Gately does not have a background in quantitative sciences, as he has little skill in accurately and completely reporting procedures and results.The idea of the book and the trial and error approach is good but another author should write the second edition."
5,just like its supposed to be,"these sensors installed with ease, they are top quality and i expect them to last as long as the originals."
2,"Snap On, Flop Off","This lens cap was a replacement for one that fell off and was lost while walking around--a problem I've heard others complain about with Nikkor lens caps. The squeeze release gets the lens cap off quickly and gives a good hold while removing it, but doesn't engage reliably."
3,"good product, the shippment was slow though","the product is what i wanted it to be. the shippment was slow though. overall, it's a good shopping experience"
5,Nikon lens cap,I ordered the wrong size last time but this one fits so I guess it does the job and I can cover my lens and have an extra just in case now.
4,Nikon replacement lens cap,"Works great, good price and fast shipment! It seems to be a genuine Nikon, and is a workable replacement for the one I lost. It's a 67mm for a special lens."
4,Let's rock again!,"After RCA had such huge success with Elvis Presley, every other record company set out to sign their own white rock and roller. Gene Vincent was Capitol's version of ""Elvis"". Having said that, he was still very talented in his own right. This CD features 20(+1) of his best recordings from 1956 to 1958. It was supposed to be followed up by Capital Collectors Series Vol 2, featuring his recordings from 1959 to 1962, but that CD never came out. Anyway, all of his best known recordings are on this CD. If you are looking for a Gene Vincent CD, this would be a good one to get."
4,Great Rock-A-Billy,"This is an excellent album. If you enjoy early rock and roll, and rock-a-billy you'll love this Gene Vincent album.The Mean Eyed CatKNON Radio 89.3Dallas, Texas"
5,"Good basic terminology, helps memorization",This is a great book for learning basic terminology. It helps you to be able to break words down and understand them. Lots of opportunity for review. This book was very helpful to me.
4,"Quick Medical Terminology: A Self-Teaching Guide, 4th Edition",If find this to be a good quick reference to terminology. I would recommend this as a basic overview of medical terminology.
4,Medical Terminology Book,So far I have read through the book and it looks like it is going to be very helpful! It is also a very interesting book. I like how it shows you the breakdown of the words.
2,quick medical terminology,"This book was required, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it. Might be helpful for someone with absolutely no idea of terminology, I find it really redundant."
5,Just what I needed!,"When the book first arrived, I was skeptical when I thumbed through it. Now that I've completed chapter 1 and am well into chapter 2, I have to say that I love it! The lessons can be kind of repetitive, but they are not overdone - the repetition really helps to solidify the meanings for me. I have no medical background whatsoever (I need to learn some medical terms in preparation for a course I'll be taking), but this book makes learning the root words, prefixes, and suffixes easy! This is so much better than just memorizing words off a list."
5,A Sound Investment,"This is a good book for someone who knows either no medical terminologyor only has a limited knowledge of it. That's not to say it's not good for someone who just needs to brush up on the basics, though. It's easy to ready and informative, and won't break the bank. If you workin the science and/or healthcare industries, I reccommend that you add this to your library."
1,not college level,"This book is pitched at an extremely low levelquite beyond anything in the 'math for poets'category - often dropping below even that of highschool. Indeed, the book compares unfavorablywith the canonical hs text by Jacobs. To givejust one example, it takes the authors 273 pagesto get to the idea of cross multiplication [a staplein the repertoire of any decent middle schoolstudent]. In particular, math majors as wellas anyone interested in the subject shouldsteer clear of this and consider instead books byPedoe, Court, Coxeter, etc. If you are lookingfor a problem oriented approach to geometry, trythe relevant offering in the Schaum's series[acknowledged masters of this approach].In the meantime, let's not sacrifice any more treesfor products as weak as this."
5,Best Poirot Ever,"I have watched every Agatha Christie ""Poirot"" since the 70's. David Suchet is absolutely hands down the best. Watch it today!"
5,Really enjoying this Blu Ray,"I am a big Poirot fan. This blu ray version is just great. The buildings, scenery, and even period clothing just pop on the screen. Will save my money and get series 2."
5,POIROT,"I really thought the British version may be a bit too dry for me. But, alas, I really enjoyed all of the Hercule Poirot shows. I have read the previous revues, and was skepticle. I like this series. The scenery is beautiful. Makes you feel like you are there!. I will continue to buy this series, hopefully there will be some sales!! Yes, I do like Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot, probably better but you can't compare apples to oranges. They are both good in different settings."
3,The musics are difficult to sing...,"My daughter is five years old and loves to sing. We bought a karaoke for her as a Christmas gift. She loves princes too, so we bought this CD ""Disney's Karaoke Series: Disney Princess, vol.2"" but the musics are very difficult for her to sing..."
2,No Words,How can this be called a Karaoke Series DVD? There were no words to sing along. Unless you know the song...you are out of luck.
5,Beecham: Champion of Delius,"As a devoted admirer of the music of Frederick Delius, I was delighted to find this series of 3 CDs of Thomas Beecham's conducting the music of Frederick Delius.Although the remastering could have been better, the price for each disc was right (astonishingly inexpensive). The merchants, from whom I purchased the CDs at Amazon, were extremely quick in filling my order. I was very pleased with their service and with the content of each CD. These are great additions to my already large collection of the works of Delius."
2,"Interesting story, but not as well written","I loved AGent of Change, its one of those books you can read over and over, I couldn't wait until this book came out in prinT! However this book does not have its charm. THe characters are little flat, and I did not feel any empathy toward them. I think part of it is that the writers were concentrating on getting the plot to a certain point and the characters suffered for it. I would NOT recommend this book to a person who is just starting to read the Liaden series. It would kill any interest in reading the other books."
5,This is on my desert island list,"I purchased this double album in 2003 in some cheap music store in Barcelona. I was new and only put me back 7 euros. Best purchase for an album EVER. If I could only take 10 albums with me to a desert island, this would definitely make the cut (along with Beach Boys Pet Sounds and Sublime's 40oz to Freedom).It takes awhile for the hooks to set in (I'd start with the second disc first), but they will always stay with you. Highly Recommended.update: I wrote this review before reading the other reviews. I didn't know the desert island vote was already used!"
5,The Legendary Joao Gilberto,"The collection ""The Legendary Joao Gilberto"" combines all the very distinctive e a r l y productions of Joao Gilberto without any glamorous gloss overs by orchestra or rhythm groups. So it's all the genuine Joao - voice and guitar - and no baroque trinkets or malformation. Enjoy unalduterated bossa nova."
5,Enthusiastically recommended for poetry and nature lovers alike.,"Robert Frost: New England in Autumn is a DVD presentation of a medley of Robert Frost's classic poems, selected to perfectly suit a brisk autumn day in New England. Filmed in the vibrant farm country of Massachusetts, Robert Frost: New England in Autumn includes readings of ""The Pasture"", ""The Exposed Nest"", ""Bluebird"", ""After Apple-Picking"", ""The Wood-Pile"", ""The Road Not Taken"", and many more, for a total of eighteen poems. Enthusiastically recommended for poetry and nature lovers alike. 29 minutes, color."
1,This does for poetry what sunshine in summer does to potato salad,"The reading is weak, the camera and work and wardrobe is laughable, and the editing makes it unwatchable.I showed this to my students and it resembles a cheap sopa opera...bad acting, bad angles, fake emotions, and it is put together in a way that the poems aren't introduced, they just start and unless you are very familiar with the poetry of Robert Frost, you won't be able to distinguesh when one poem ends and another begins. I was veery disappointed."
4,Robert Frost Poetry in Context,"This video is pure poetry surrounded by New England in autumn. If you enjoy hearing poetry and like Robert Frost at all, this is a good investment. The readings are not the best I have heard, but the poetry is delivered well and the background is wonderful."
3,Carbon Rubber Electrode,The electrode is shown in the photo with the ridge running full depth. The ridge has a hole in it that is used to insert the metal pin. The full length ridge would have enought length to insert a pin on both ends. The electrodes we recieved had half of this ridge cut away. The picture was not representative of the product. Cutting this ridge is not a good idea as several types of equipment require two electrodes to be connected to one rubber electrode.
2,ok but no long term solution,"These bags are a great idea but if you intend to store items such as comforters, feather beds, clothes and other bulky items on a repeat basis, you'll be disappointed. They work very well the first time, but once opened and reused, the seal and seams just don't hold up well. In other words, they leak. Once the bag leaks, air enters and the bag inflates causing it to expand. If you place the vacuumed bag tightly in a closet, you'll have problems getting it out because everything is super tight.So if you intend to store something and not reusing the bag a few times, these just may do the trick."
5,A Glorious Account,This recording has had many CD incarnations and now this is offered at a budget price. I cannot recommend this highly enough or overstate how great Reinhard Goebel and his MAK ensemble are in their performance of Bach. A must have!!!
2,Very Typical -- Don't bother,"This is the every day, common story of the 'fall from grace' of those touched by the gambling bug. Once you've read a few books about gamblers and gambling addiction, you'll realize that this story is the network TV version of what it's really like (if you want the cable version, check out ""Stung: the incredible obsession of Brian Molony""). The author's intent is good I suppose, but characters' dialog is absurd, contrived and filled with unrealistic bravado. Clearly, the author is no gambling addict -- not a bad thing! Though the addictive symtoms and behavior illustrated throughout the novel are conceptually accurate, they're depicted with a simplicity that renders their phenominal effect almost trivial. I struggled and shook my head through the entire book. For the casual enthusiast, could be a good airport terminal read. Otherwise, you're better off playing cell phone solitaire."
3,A very good description of how people get addicted,Nelson is not the greatest novelist in the world but he has written an excellent description of how a perfectly normal thirty-four year old man with no particular interest in gambling can become hopelessly addicted in a matter of months. It is totally believable in this regard and for this Nelson must be commended.
2,Mildy entertaining cautionary tale,This book was mildly entertaining. It was a little far fetch that the main character could go on such a downward spiral in such a short time. Research had some errors such as stating the house has a 4% edge on a basic strategy player. It is actually closer to 4/10 of a percent. A big difference.
1,Boulder fan,"To be very blunt, this book is dumb and disjointed. Previous books by this author are much better, especially her early novels."
1,"Alas, another hatchet job","Buying this DVD is an utter waste of your money and time. Since it's supposed to be 94 minutes long and is here only 56 minutes, what you've got us less than 2/3 of the actual film. Who wants to lay out $10 for this scam?"
3,"Full length, in colour","People who write reviews should watch the movie first. This movie is full length and in colour.Rod Cameron may not be all that great here but he is a natural when playing traditional western roles. We need Rod Cameron westerns,especially from the mid to late 40's and the 50's. And they need to be remastered and sharpened. Please, somebody. They're worth it. They have good stories and supporting casts."
3,"salome,where she danced","this is a camp classic - it's a quite a lavish production.The print is not great, as Universal seems to have lost the rights.Anyway it's the best one I have seen.This movie which was Yvonne DeCarlo's first starringrole, made her a star.She sings one song - the other is dubbed. It really is worth watching."
1,Classic turkey,"It's no wonder that Leonard Maltin rated this film a ""bomb."" It is. I have the colorized VHS, and that makes things even worse. The script is written in cliches. The story is ridiculous, taking place in Europe and in the American West. (After a 23-hour stage coach ride to the frontier town that was her destination, Yvonne looks clean and refreshed, heavy makeup still perfect.) The ""dancing"" is pathetic, and wholly unerotic. (At least they taught 23-year-old Yvonne how to bound around on toe shoes.) The acting is moronic; Rod Cameron especially needed to earn an honest living. Charles Lamont, the director, did his usual worst. In short, a ""bomb."""
4,Pretty Good,"It is a pretty good toy, and it works like it says it does. but, you have to be really neat, organized, and patient. Mine turned out fine and I got them a 2 years ago and they're still in my living room."
1,Junk junk junk!,"When I was a kid I had petal making kits where you bend the wire yourself and dip the loop in the petal paint stuff. Fun and easy. I cannot tell you how bad this was. I am in my forties and I even had trouble bending the wire on this impossible little piece of plastic crappy mold thing, then it had to fit into a matching mold and lay flat. Ha!! Then we opened up the petal paint stuff, of which they gave us about half a teaspoon of each color for the whole kit! I had a 4yr old and a 5year old, and I had to do all the work. Yeah, the kit says 5, but I had trouble doing it myself, and I went to art school so it should have been a breeze for me. Do Not Waste Your Money!"
5,A MUST FOR FANS OF ELECTRONIC MUSIC!,"I first heard of DJ DADO on a trance compilation and really liked the song ""Revenge"" and I was skeptical about buying this cd thinking that this was his only good song, but when I popped this cd into my stereo I was totally surprised all the songs are great a couple are mediocre but still a good cd. The music is melodic and has an ambient feeling to them, but yet it's not commercial. My favorite songs are ""Revenge"", ""Hour By Hou""r, ""Dreaming"", and ""I'm In Love"". It hasnt left my cd player for a week now. Fans of Robert Miles will like this album. Anybody who likes good electronic music will like DJ DADO."
5,Great place for storage,"We ordered the Keter Vertical Storage Shed after checking around for the best price for our needs. This shed is perfect for all of the brooms, mops, etc. that collect in your home that you want access to. We have the shed on the outside deck of our home and it handles weather just great. No leaks. We just love it. And the price was great too."
5,The best way to train your dog.,This is the way to train your dog. Not using a million treats to try to bribe them to do what you want. And not forcing them to do your bidding either. But getting your dog to see you as their true leader and then they want to please you. It is simple to learn and implement. I highly recommend this book.
5,"best dang Legoland there is....wait, its the only?","I remember when I was 5-6 and on the computer playing this, and when we upgraded our computer to Window's XP, I couldnt play it. but here I am, 14 years old, and wanting to playing it again"
4,"cute, but lacking just a bit in functionality","First, let me say that this is a reasonably priced toaster over and it is absolutely adorable. The color is great and it adds a lot of personality to my blah kitchen. However it isn't as versatile as other toaster ovens I've owned in the past. When I ordered this product, there wasn't a detailed decription of the features so I wasn't aware that there isn't a temperature selection dial. This means that the only control you have is time. So it's great for toasting but doesn't broil or allow you to choose other temperatures to heat other foods. So it's more of a toaster oven style toaster than a true toaster oven in my opinion. Very cute though."
4,Works fine,"This toaster oven is a good oven for the right price. It's black and it works just fine. It does have an annoying bell that bings when the timer is up, but that is not too bad. It's only dial is a timer, that lets you heat for a set amount of time. There is no temperature gauge or anything else. So it's not high on features, but it is low on price. :)"
2,Not a toaster oven!,"This is a toaster only, and works fine as such. Mine arrived several days after the scheduled date, and with a large dent on the top."
3,"good, but ...","My contact, the first one, with Richard Bona, was something like ""love for ever"". All of his music was superb. Fresh, amazing tunes and arregments. The ability taking music from everywhere with out loose his roots. His voice, like an angel, and , Hey man! how does he play the bass!, and always in a humble way, at the service to the music. But this record, and is a pity, is just ""nice"". No less but no more. more commercial, with out high points. I use it just for background on a good conversation. I still, of course, trust in his talent.If you want to know the best of this man just try all the previous records, including Toto/Bona/Lokua and the colaboration on Mino Cinelu record (try to find it!)."
4,Old-Fashioned Bach,"This issue offers a generous sampling of Bach keyboard concertos performed in the grand manner that distinguished Karl Richter's recordings. I find that manner uplifting, but other listeners might find the textures inflated and the rhythms insufficiently sprung. The recording is clear but balanced in favor of the well-upholstered orchestra as over against the rather tinkly harpsichord. A qualified recommendation."
5,Lush,"Since I do not have the formal musical training which would allow me to comment on the technical virtues of this performance, I can say, without regret, that this is your best bet for the price. The First Symphony is a lush, one movement masterpiece. The Second Symphony, sadly disowned by the composer, is also worthy of further performance. And the First Essay for Orchestra and the School for Scandal are more than worthy fillers. The sound quality matches Barber's music for lushness. The price is unbeatable. The performance of the First Symphony, at least, matches that of a full priced version performed by Leonard Slatkin and the St. Louis Symphony and released on RCA. Romantic, elegant, emotional, and tasteful."
4,Great for Many!,"This recording for quality and price, is perfect for anyone who is curious about Sam Barber's stuff. The whole Alsop/Barber series on Naxos is worth having!"
3,"Barber, under the influence of horse tranquilizers","At Alsop's tempo, listening 'The School for Scandal' is like trying to run underwater. On the positive side, this slowness lets you pick out some details in the music that are usually lost in the shuffle. It reminds me of when my orchestra rehearses a piece at a slower tempo to iron out the fine points. I much prefer Slatkin's rendition, which is speedier and has less leaden wind solos.This is the first time that I've heard the symphonies, and they seem to be good readings. Still, though, in slow passages, Alsop sounds like he's slogging through mud. This particularly applies to the First Essay for Orchestra, which sounds repressed rather than delicate.I bought this recording to get acquainted with the symphonies, though, and in that respect it was great, and very cheap. The symphonies aren't amazing pieces, but they do have the unique sound of an American trying to make something 'modern' with a romantic palette."
3,Content okay. Problem with writing style.,"I purchased this book(along with Infinite Self) based on the previous reviews. I found the content to be okay, nothing earth-shattering from either a business or meta-physical standpoint. Where I had the most problems was with the author's writing style. The author tends to ramble, though he includes some good stories.In terms of content, I recommend this book for those that have not been exposed to books on how to think about money and success. Others may find the content redundant. In terms of style, it will depend upon the taste of the reader, but the principles could have been laid out in less than 50 pages."
2,The book was great until.....,"I came to the place where Mr. Wilde talks about my employer Mr. Marriott. Mr. Wilde apparently had a bad experience at one of the hotels and instead of complaining to the General Manager, he pours out two pages of ugliness about Mr. Marriott. Not very spiritual or metaphysical. It made me wonder about the rest of the book. Is it just talk?"
4,Great Book!,"This book is not a get-rich-quick scheme. What it can do for you, if you are open to utilizing its suggestions, is help to change the way you think about money. As the saying says, change your thinking and you change your life. What you think about and focus on becomes your reality. This book really helped me to not only understand in terms of knowledge, but in terms of wisdom, that money is just energy like EVERYTHING ELSE. It is only as important as the value we place on it. This book can open your eyes to a good look at the limiting beliefs surrounding your relationship with money. It's up to you to heal the riffs, but in my opinion, this book is a good start."
5,Great read!,"Finished it all in one go, great read. Nice eye opener. Would recommend it to anyone looking to expand their comfort zone to allowing their mind to receive greater wealth, and tearing down pre-conceived limits regarding money."
5,Explore an awesome man!,"I can echo a previous reviewer by allowing my breath to be taken away, a starry eyed response to an exquisite mind. Read all of him purely because he is not what he seems. I am currently reading this one slowly to prolong the taste in my mouth!"
1,sadly misguided hocus pocus,"If only wishing would make it so, this book would be the perfect cure for anything that ails you. Eating sprouts, nuts and other raw whole foods is not generally harmful, but it's a far cry from curing diseases such as AIDS, as the author claims. Written in 1987, the book is a monument to all that was wrong with alternative medicine movement."
2,Redundant DVD,I purchased both the CD/DVD package w. extra track on CD Coplands 'Fanfare For The Common Man' and the DVD ( product being reviewed) and BOTH DVDs are exactly the SAME hence Redundant DVD !!!!!
1,Not good camo colors,the light green color is almost white....this is not a good camo color. The tape itself works fine.
5,Excellent,It is the story of 3 boys spending their summer in a lighthousse. The story is entertaining and after reading this book 34 years ago I still can remember the story with clarity
4,Pefect for the coffee table,"This book on port is a great piece to have out on your coffee table or other visible location for guests to flip through when they come over. There is a brief history and description of the variants, followed by the meat of the book, a run down on the various brands and their origins. The book is highly informative and is a great resource for novice drinkers and the accomplished afficionado. My only complaint is that it spends too much time on the brands and not quite enough time on the variants and history of the wine.Overall, though, a great buy and definitely something to share with friends, neighbors, and relatives. Keep a copy out during the Christmas season especially!"
5,Awesome Sequel to Wizard of Oz.,"I bought this movie the other day cause i love Fantasy and i am satisified with it. Dorothy ( Fariuza Balk) goes back to Oz and finds it a disaster area, she meets new friends and must rescue the kingdom from a evil worse than the Wicked Witch of the west. good-acting, a well-written script and lots of fun that makes this a Trip that you and your kids would love."
4,Enjoyment,"I haven't actually viewed my purchase yet, but the condition I received it in was quite satisfactory. I am positive that I shall enjoy it. THANKS! :)"
3,Not a sugar-coated classic redone,"When one blows off the sugar-coating of the Oz stories - and in comparison to the classic music with Judy Garland - you have a sometimes scary story with some strange ideas. While this is fun, it's also extremely absurd and it is readily apparent that Frank L. Baum was one strange guy - an author who's ideas walked a barely cohesive tightrope and we designed to be anything but bedtime stories. Still...an interesting story and presentation, but not for smaller children."
5,Beautiful DVD,"I remember renting this one over and over again until a few years afterwards I couldn't remember the title of it anymore and it disapeared from the shelves. I think they could have done a better job with Dorothy being a bit older than what Judy Garland was in the first, but its neat to see the cast from a different light it kind of makes it fresh again, more like the storybook than hollywood. Get this one, Save it, Cherish it."
4,Walter Murch's Return To OZ...,"In This Semisequel To ""The Wizard Of OZ"", Viewers Will Hear No Songs, Nor See Any Munchkins...It Is A Very Different Film, But Equally Enjoyable, Trip Down The Yellowbrick Road With Fairuza Balk Outstanding As Dorothy...It Gets Pretty Scary At Times And Isn;t All Flluff And Wonder Like The Original OZ...This Is Nevertheless A Magical Film For The Child In Everyone..."
5,it continues the classic oz story and surpasses the original,"it has an appealing weirdness that goes throughout the movie,the original dorothy was better than this one."
3,Scary . . . careful with kids,"I haven't seen this DVD edition yet so I can't really comment on it, but I just wanted to put in one word about the movie. I saw it at age 5 or so when it was in the theaters, and it scared the stuffing out of me. There were a few parts that gave me nightmares and still make me shiver. It's probably not as bad as I've made it out to be, but do use caution letting younger kids watch this."
1,Disney wrost movie.,Why bother making a sequal movie like this. Disney should never made a update movie after Wizard of OZ.
3,No captions?!,I have loved this movie since the day I saw it in the theatre when I was about a year younger than Fairuza Balk was when she was in it. I loved that they had Fairuza Balk talking about her role and the experiences she had but I found that there was one drawback. The movie has not been closed captioned! I didn't know that they released movies these days that are not closed captioned. Very disapointing for my brother since he has loved this movie almost as long as I have and is hearing impaired. I hope someday they will release a closed captioned version so he can finally hear/read everything and understand the story fully.
3,Excellent Film... DVD needs more features,"""Return to Oz"" is a wonderful film. But since there are already over 60 reviews here regarding the filmmaking itself, I feel that I should mention something about the disapointing lack of features on the DVD. Sure, we get the widescreen and standard version on one disc... but where are the extras that DVD fans have come to expect? No subtitles. No notes. No biographies of the cast and crew. All we get is a very brief interview with Fairuza Balk... and she really doesn't say anything of great interest. If you like this movie enough, it's worth buying. I wouldn't go so far as to say that I REGRET this purchase. But the DVD certainly isn't worth $3.50 more than VHS."
5,There's a curse on the Yellow Brick Road,"While I do believe that the 1939 adaptation of L. Frank Baum's ""Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" is a classic that shouldn't be messed with, I prefer ""Return to Oz"" because of its more faithful approach to Baum's work. Plus, it's much darker and more intense (the Wheelers will certainly scare the little ones), and Dorothy is indeed played by a young girl, and not a 17-year old Judy Garland (I mean no offense; she was a talented actress indeed, but Fairuza Balk is more believeable here). The special effects are spectacular, and Princess Mombi and her many heads are visually stunning.So be careful, this will not be as sweet and innocent as ""The Wizard of Oz"" and the kids will probably be frightened by the many dark elements in the film (such as Dorothy's electro-shock therapy and the Tin Man's frozen posture).A+"
4,Bringing back memories...,"I hadn't seen this in a long time and when I got it on DVD, I had to watch it almost immediately. It's a very odd movie, but I really enjoy it. I would say, however that it isn't for everyone. It's very dark and has some creepy tones to it, but it's an interesting continuation of the story of Dorothy who is longing to go back to Oz and finds that a lot has changed since she left, and not for the better."
5,This is one of my favorite Movies,"This is one of my very favorite movies of all time. It's much, much better than the first Wizard of Oz movie. I love the story and all the visual richness. It's one of the few movies I can enjoy watching more than once. I wish they would make many more Oz movies exactly like this one."
3,10 yr old twins: 1 loved it - 1 hated it,"OK - My kids loved Wizard of Oz so I picked this up for them. I have 10yr old boy/girl twins and a 4yr old boy. The boys LOVED it but my daughter HATED it! It is MUCH darker than the original movie, but follows the book much closer. I think my daughter was expecting the singing/dancing of the original movie. She was scared to death of The Wheelers and the whole head changing issue. The boys thought the whole movie was ""cool"" and not babyish. They liked that it was weird. My personal opinion of the movie? I have to go with my daughter on this one! Didn't like it a bit! I'd take the original Wizard of Oz hands down! Return to Oz is not for the scaredy cats by any means."
3,Beats a Blank....,"I'm glad to see any of the other Oz stories even acknowledged, let alone made into film. Having said that, this film wasn't that bad at all. It would have been better had I not been so familiar with all of the characters of the Oz series. Everything was fine until they misnamed the princess with the mix & match heads Mombi! Mombi was a wicked OLD witch with a patch over one eye & a crooked walk. She was responsible for turning Princess Ozma into a boy (thus hiding her) named Tip. The princess with the changing heads was called Princess Languere & she was easily bored, thus she changed her look & mood.This may seem a minor detail to the novice, but they basicallyleft out a huge chunk of story by trying to combine characters.Read the books!"
1,Sickening,"I watched this as a child and was traumatized! The wicked ""witch"" in this movie has a corridor full of the heads of her victims which she puts on herself whenever she wants to change her appearance. This is not the fanciful dream of Oz #1; this is a nightmare! NOT a kid's movie. I'm glad it was scrapped."
2,Return to OZ?,"Honestly I can see why this movie bombed back in the eighties when it was released! I really don't know what planet some of these reviewers are living on , it is boring, cheesey effects and the claymation is second rate! Disney could have and should have done a lot better with this release, and I am sure they know it! I had a good laugh after watching this movie thinking back how some people said in their reviews ""not for children"" Come on!!!! Geez, I thought the old version of Wizard of Oz had some scenes in it that were waaayyy creepier than any of this movie! Do not be deceived by these ridiculous four and five star ratings, it rates two stars at best!!!"
1,Return to where?,"Return to Oz, starring Fairuza Balk and Piper Laurie, is the kind of movie that makes your mouth drop to the floor and your head drop in shame. This movie had some wonderful ideas, but none of them come across as serious fun, only hokey jokes. Trying to get past the fact that this is a sequel to one of the best movies of all time is hard enough, but watching all of our favortie characters from the original jump around playfully like muppets is completly ludicrous. But I must give credit where credit is due: the movie is very similar to the way L Frank Baum described it in the OZ books, and if you DON'T compare it to the Wizard of Oz, it does work on a few levels, only moderately. If you strip this movie of it's name and give it another, it might work for it's time. But come on people, this is Oz, and this is terrible."
5,just as good as the first,It is just as good as the first i loved the movie.I first saw it when i was 5 and im 13 now and i still love it.I will say some of the characters are alittle bit freaky but its still good for kids ages 1 to 21 i rate it 5 stars cause it changed my life in a weird kid kind of way.But like i said i love the movie and i would recomend it to anyone to watch my sister and i love it and we talk about it all the time and we wish television would play it.But tv never does so were gonna buy it.Ok so peace out and watch it.
4,Worth Getting!,I enjoyed this movie. The Wizard of Oz is my favorite of all time. This sequel is very well done. If you have the first one you should have this one too. The whole family will enjoy it.
5,MORE OZ - COOL!,This show was a favorite for my son when he was growing up! He is now 22 and requested ir to be purchased for our dvd collection for his birthday. Good for all ages.
4,I think this movie was great.,"The reason I like this movie is,because they started where the oringinal left off.Fairuza Balk is excellent in her first movie.The character are delightful,and witty.I recommend this movie."
5,OLD SCHOOL FAVORATE,HAVENT SEEN THIS MOVIE IN FOREVER WAS SO THRILLED TO FIND SUCH A GEM! THANK YOU! AND THE PRICE WAS PRETTY AWESOME TOO! =)
3,Nostalgia,"Much as I wish otherwise, this is not a great film. I find it very imaginative and the acting of Dorothy is very natural but it seems to be missing something and I can't figure out what it is. Still, Iliked it enough to buy it!"
4,NOT a sequel to the musical...,"...and if you view it with that understanding, you may be pleasantly surprised. Another very imaginative childrens' fantasy of the 80s (right up there with Labyrinth and The Never Ending Story). My 4 year old daughter loves this movie. Some reviewers here have complained that it is too dark, but I think children will generally prefer a dark, but emotionally honest, film to a condescendingly bright movie any day. Still, some kids are more susceptible to nightmares than other, so be aware that there are a few scenes that could give very sensitive viewers bad dreams."
3,Wonderful movie...but...,"I love this film...so close to the great books of Baum. However after finally getting it on DVD, the film quality is not good...the colors and picture are not crisp and clean...not sharp...it almost looks like a video transfer...what a shame! Such a beautiful production full of color. Am I crazy or is this a dud transfer? They say this movie is scary...well delve into the books...they are scary and divine!"
5,Love this movie,This is a movie I saw as a child and it stuck with me ever since. I LOVE this movie! I was so excited to be able to find it after all those years. Other reviewers have already given great reviews on the contents of the movie. View theirs for details.
5,Thank you,"Thank you! The DVD was exactly what I have been looking for! This was the first time I bought from Amazon.com, and I will for sure buy again!"
5,One of the best movies ever made!,"I don`t care what people say this is the best movie ever, a light hearted family movie from the labyrinth, dark crystal, return of the jedi genre. People say this is an insult to the wizard of oz but in fact if these people had read the books by the late L. Frank Baum they would of realised that this follows his books more closely than the wizard of oz does, don`t get me wrong its a great film. The characters in Return to oz Are more cuter than its prequel, like Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, Billina and my favourite the Gump. But also more scary characters like the wheelers, princess Mombi and the Gnome King. So please watch this great movie fully before you judge, its the greatest."
3,Loved it as a kid- not so much as an adult,"I've always had good memories of seeing this movie as a kid. It scared the crap outta me, but I still liked it. I was surprised that my wife had never heard of it, so I thought it would be great to get it for Halloween. It was pretty cool to see it again... for about the first 30 to 45 mins. But, wow. It was not as good as I remembered. We did laugh pretty hard at the talking chicken. But, after a while my wife said, ""Do we have to watch it all?"" It was hard to finish the movie, but we slaved thru it. Afterward, I felt like my childhood memory of the movie was better than the movie itself. Maybe I should have left it that way. However, I do own the disc now and will probably let my future kids watch it."
3,be warned,"I first saw return to oz when I was 5 years old and to tell you the truth it scared me. Now that i am older I can understand the movie and enjoy it, but to a young child it has a lasting impression. The first scene in the hospital and the hall of living heads scared me so much I had nightmares about it afterwards. To any parents thinking of letting their young children watch it, think again, while it is a great movie and one of the better sequels I have seen, it can be extremely frightening to a child. I now love the movie, but when I was younger i found it very scary."
1,Disappointed!,Received first copy....had glitches! So replacement....guess what glitches in the movie again! One of my fav movies but wanna copy with no glitches!
3,Great Story but had some hangups.,"Overall, a great adventure. However, due to low budget effects, and Fairuza Balk attempting to sound like Judy Garland in a few scenes, it takes away from what the movie could have been. 3-stars."
5,RETURN TO OZ,THIS WAS A FUN MOVIE FOR MY FAMILY TO WATCH TOGETHER. ALL MY GRANDCHILDREN LOVED THE MOVIE. MADE A NICE EVENIANG FOR FAMILY FUN.
4,The dark side of Oz.,"If you are looking for this to be like the first ""OZ"" then you should look elsewhere. Very creative and an interesting story, but much darker and ""over the rainbow"" type singing. I personally really like it, but nothing like the original."
4,"Liked the movie, liked the actors, and liked the mandolin!","Though I liked The Wizard of Oz starring Judy Garland as Dorothy better I did also like Return To Oz starring Fairuza Balk as Dorothy and though Return to Oz is very different it is good in it's ownright and not a terrible movie at all, I guess it's one of those movies that you either like or hate but I really liked it and I recommend this movie be watched and enjoyed and admired for it's own merits instead of being compared to A Wizard of OZ which was just an entirely different kind of movie. Retun To Oz also has given me a appreciation for the mandolin the unusual looking stringed instrument that Mombi played which another reviewer said was a piccolo but even though it's probably of little importance to anyone and probably being nitpicky but I wanted to point out that it was a mandolin and not a piccolo."
5,"Incredible movie, So-So DVD","This is one of my favorite childhood movies (also Neverending Story, Dark Crystal, and the Goonies). All of these movies are slightly scary and very ""dark"" - perfect examples of 80's treasures.Fairuza Balk is even cuter as a 10-year-old then she is now (and that's pretty cute!) and she makes this movie precious.This film was out of print for a while, but then was re-released as a collector's edition clamshell VHS and DVD. The DVD doesn't have anything more than the VHS - they both have an interview with a much older Fairuza.I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves fantasy and the darker kind of movies.(P.S. - it's NOT a musical)"
5,Way better than the 1939 version,"This movie is probably the only live-action (I'm not counting live action/animation)Disney film that is dark, but awesome. It's more attached to the books than the sugar-coated 1939 version ever was. If L.Frank Baum was alive in the 1980's, then he would have loved this movie.(spoilers)Probably the scariest scene in the entire movie is when she is trying to get the powder of life from one of Mombi's cases. She's about to get it, and then this happens:Mombi:Dooorthy Gaaale!Heads from various women begin to scream as the real headless Mombi rises from her bed. Dorothy quickly grabs the powder of life and runs like there's no tomorrow.This movie is so underrated and it's much better than the films these days, like those High School Musical crap (where are the goths, nerds, pregnant teens, and rapper-wannabees?) and Twilight (sorry, but I really hate these books/movies).If you want a good fantasy film, go with this one. Enjoy!"
4,A fun Oz story,I enjoyed this movie! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed L. Frank Baum's Oz books!
4,"Odd, odd, great","This is a serious twist on the Wizard of Oz. Different people, different setting and just different. This one is a little darker and spookier, with some campy moments and a young Faruzia Balk(Nacy from The Craft). If you are expecting it to be a sequel to the original, this will disappoint you, but if you are looking for something funny, 'scary' different and a little odd, this is the movie. There's a chicken, a moose of sorts, a witch with many heads, and tin man and the coolest rollerblading I've seen for that time. I loved it as a kid and watching again, I still love it, odd as it is. It's useless to compare the acting or 'realism' since it's an older movie, but it's still great."
5,Awesome,"Quick delivery, awesome movie. It was exactly what I was expecting.This movie though it is not noted on the site is rated PG. This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. It is a nice spin of returning to oz with some new and interesting characters (tic toc, the couch, jack pumpkin head). Just keep in mind if your kid is under 5 it may be a bit creepy because the witch collects heads and wears them and may come off as scary. 6 year old boy loved it!"
4,WALT DISNEY CLASSIC BUT DOES'NT TOP THE ORIGANAL!,"A dark and gloomy belated sequel to the 1939 classic, The Wizard Of Oz, which follows Dorothy on her second adventure to Oz which this times is in ruins. There is not such a feel good atmosphere here as there are none of the usual sing along songs and the atmosphere is chilling throughout, deeming it a little unsuitable for very small children. However despite its often gloomy feel this is a surprising classic with its stunning visual effects and great characters like Tik Tok and the wheelers which are all drawn from various Oz books by L.Frank Baum. Some of the sets are truly magnificent. Does not top The Wizard Of Oz but a classic never the less and one very much recommended."
5,"This movie is EXCELLENT, FABULOUS, WONDERFUL....I LOVE IT","This movie is so much better than The Wizard of Oz you wouldn't believe it. Fairuza Balk is the best dorothy there ever was...not to mention the new characters introduced in this movie (esp. Belina). The Gnome King is much more cunning and subtle thant he wicked witch. In conclusion this movie is stupendous and everyone should see it...if you don't like it, well I can't even think of such a thing."
4,A solid sequel to a classic,"It is always difficult to make a sequel to a classic film, especially if you do so a decade or more later. This becomes next to impossible if it is a film that is based on a novel or series of novels. Most people know of the original Wizard of Oz film, but most are unaware that it is all based on a series of books. This film is a solid effort to keep to the books, while also paying homage to the original film. This is one of the first films Disney did in the live action area, and it is a solid effort. Fairuza Balk is well casted as Dorothy, and the work by Lucas and Henson in the film is top notch. This is a great film to have, be it for your kids or for your personal collection."
1,will not play in US,"Unfortunately, I purchased this video twice from amazon. The first time i got it, I purchased it from a company out of the UK,, it would not play in my DVD player, or my new Mac laptop. It only cost me a few bucks, so i thought i would chalk it up to being my mistake and not bother with a refund. I really wanted to see this old movie, so I went on again and bought it from Minneapolis. But it still won’t play! I think it should have stated in the DVD description that it is not in the correct format for US use. Very disappointed."
5,I Love it!,i've always loved this movie! It's awesome....I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Wizard of Oz. It's not exactly like the original as far as the set design and characters but still worth watching.
1,return to oz,"The movie did not work at all, only over sea's! Im very dissapointed!i really wanted to see the movie with my children. I cant believe i paid for something that did not work!!"
4,"Good movie, but not original by the author","The review by amazon is incorrect. This movie, although good, is not based of the original works of the author of the Oz books, L. Frank Baum. This movie is an odd mixing of the two books, the Land of Oz, and Ozma of Oz. Please do not think that this story is actually from the original author. Read the books for a full look at Oz as it was meant to be.The original Wizard of Oz movie was horrible. It is very loosely based on the original Wonderful Wizard of Oz book. A new movie series should be made."
3,A SEQUAL.....,"I RATE THIS WITH 3 STARS BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING:1. DOROTHY'S AUNT EM WOULD NEVER TAKE HER TO SHOCK THEROPY FOR BELEIVING IN SOMETHING. SHE WOULDN'T IN THE BOOKS OR THE 1939 CLASSIC. SHE IS (I THINK) SOMEWHAT CREUL. 2. I LOVE THE FACT THAT THE RUBY SLIPPERS MAKE THEIR APPERANCE. 3. OZMA AND OTHER OF THE NEW CHARECTORS FROM THE BOOKS ARE HERE.THE OLD CHARACTERS MAKE THIER APPEAANCE TOO. 4. MOMBI IS A LITTLE BIT TOO SCARY! THE HAUNTING WORDS ""DOROTHY GALE, DOROHY GAAAALLLE"" KEPT ME AWAKE FOR HOURS. 5. I WAS SURPRISED AT DISNEY, KNOWN FOR MAKING CLASSICE FILMS. TO MAKE A DARK MOVIE IS STRANGE.(FOR THEM)I DID BUY THIS ON TAPE BUT IT DOES TAKE A WHILE TO GET USED TO. IF YOU BUY IT, SOME GRAPICS AND SCENCES MAY BE INAPROPRIATE FOR KIDS UNDER 10."
5,The Return to Oz Is Excellent,"The return to oz is an awsome movie that may come across as dark as compaired to the wizard of oz. However, this movie is much better than the first. It is a movie that, once seen, will stay in your mind forever if you like it or not. I remember seeing this movie when i was much younger, and I still recall many details about it. I suggest that you get this movie"
3,A Wonderful Family movie!,I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I watched it so many times that I literally wore out the tape that my parents bought me. I am thrilled that it will be re-released because I will enjoy this movie for many more years to come. Its a great movie for kids to enjoy!
4,Sufficient,"I needed sample reference letters to write one, and it got the job done. Definitely recommend."
2,"Weyerhauser 1181 8.5x11 inch 500 sheet laser paper, inkjet white.","Paper is a good grade for the price, but it has three holes on the right side for notebooks. I use this paper for copying articles from the computer, but I would not recommend paper with holes for business letter writing."
1,Save your money and rent Crocodile Dundee again....,"When people go on vacation and come back with an accent, it's from listening to people speak. This tape is too hard to follow and hard to listen to. The guy on the tape goes over and over and over about moving your tongue here, talking through your nose and so on. No really good conversations to listen to, to pick up the accents. Too much explaining. He should have stayed in the same voice also. Save your money and rent Crocodile Dundee again or watch the Crocodile Hunter series."
2,just a yank trying to pass off as an aussie,"I ordered this book because I wanted to understand Australian dialect better. The book is very short, only 16 pages, but it contains lots of useful information. It includes phonics and speaking exercises which I found helpful. However the tape was horrible! I assumed that the tape would be done by an actual Australian; but how wrong I was! I started listening to it, and I've heard enough aussie's speak, to begin to wonder if the tape's speaker was really Australian. I soon found out however, when the speaker smoothly changed to his normal voice; east coast american! That was enough for me to start laughing insanely and finally to toss the tape into a pile of other cassette rejects, including my personal favorite; How to Speak with a Southern Accent by Zehni lai Quien!! If you really want to understand aussie dialect, listen to real aussies. But if you want a good laugh, order this!"
4,"Somewhat eclectic, but if you're from the islands or love the islands, you'll love this album","I was born in Hawaii in the early 60's and grew up listening to this album (many, many times!), so it was with great pleasure that I saw it had been re-released to a new generation of listeners. Even if you don't speak pidgin', listening to just one of these stories will quickly enlighten you as to why Kent Bowman is something of a Hawaiian cultural treasure. If there is anything else like this collection of ""interpretations"" of classic children's stories anywhere else on the planet, I'll be highly surprised. This one-of-a-kind collection should be of interest to both kids and cultural anthropologists alike, so grab it before it disappears once more into the mists of history!"
5,teenage years,i bought this cassette when i was a sophmore in high school and it was killer. my friends thought i was mental. i have lived in hawaii all but the first 7yrs of my life so they did not know of the music that i had grown up with from my older siblings. now i play it in my garage and my friends still freak over this album! haha
1,age range is off,says choking hazard on site and then box says ages 12 months +. Ordered for my 2 year old and sending back.Cute but way to young for him!
5,One of most comprehensive works on sailing ever.,"I memorized this as a sailing-mad boy half a century ago, and recently purchased a used copy online for a young relative. Until you thumb through it, the small size masks just how much fascinating detail is provided. If you're involved with wind-powered boats of any kind - get it and keep it handy."
4,Really lovely story,"This novel tells a really lovely story about a recently-divorced woman reluctantly being forced to start her life over and find happiness and fulfillment.All the characters are very well-written and well thought-out. Each one has a meaning and is not there for filler. I found all the emotions of the main character to be authentic, and her growing in fits and starts true to her situation - someone who did not want a divorce and grappled with so many emotions for her ex-husband (continuing love, anger, confusion), her daughter, her new friends, and eventually her promising new love.The title of this novel suggests that it's some kind of quirky chick-lit story, but I think that is misleading. It is a novel of humor, yes, but not without lots of layers of other emotions. It even touches on depression and anorexia in the context of a secondary character in a thoughtful way.I really enjoyed reading this book and was dreading the last page. It was a very satisfying reading experience."
4,"Yes, you CAN recover from betrayal with style!","Betrayal, from a friend, co-worker or even worse--your spouse is devastating. The whole process of one step forward and two steps back can seem so pointless unless you persist long enough to finally turn around and see how far you've come. This authorhandles the horrible process of spouse betrayal and the recovery process with wisdom and sensual writing. Her use of perfumesand their descriptions create a safe spot for the female lead to retreat to as well as create an entire new category to learn about. Discussions of essences and beautiful bottles, work in a fragant restaurant bring in food and menus and when the greatest new guy shows up! I almost held my breath all the way through the courtship! This is a delightful book about love, recovery, healing and could be enjoyed by everyone from teen to senior."
3,"good story, even though...","Ms Samuel shows real promise as a story teller. This is a fairly gripping story about losses, choices, identity and making the best of things. The editing is atrocious, with egregious grammar errors any decent editor should catch and continuity errors. For example, one of the characters comes over to borrow flour from her neighbor to make pancakes for her children, A few pages later it refers back to this incident but says she made them French toast. Doh! Do not have to borrow flour to make French toast. (Or if you do, it's going to take a very long time...)Maybe such things do not bother some readers, but they throw me out of the story and kind of spoil the flow. Still, there are some very well-drawn characters. I say let's keep reading her and urge her to get some good editing help!"
5,Good News,"This book is great and the author goes out of his way to assist with any questions.He gives you his personal Email and answers all questions promptly.He has helped me with numerous questions about retirement.Give it a try, you'll be a lot smarter about how to handle this difficult subject.Joe"
5,American Tall-Tale in Ebonics,"I first read this book as a child, and have re-read it many times as an adult. It is the story of alarger-than-life hero which appears to take place in the late 19th century. In Bradford's ""JohnHenry"", the traditional ""steel-drivin'"" man is a steamboat roustabout who goes up and down theMississippi, from town to town, job to job, woman to woman. A lively cast of characters,including Stagger Lee, Poor Selma, and a character who pops up in odd places, referred to onlyas ""a nigger named Sam"" make this a very amusing story, and a great read for any age. Animaginative film producer (Spike Lee, perhaps?) could make a fortune from a movie version.John Henry's run-ins with women, bosses, liquor, cocaine, bad guys, gambling, and the law rolloff him like water off a duck's back. A true superhero, his demise eventually comes in anunexpected way. I won't ruin the end--if you find this book, it's a must-read."

1,Booo! A CD-R is not worth the price! EVER!,"Buyer Beware! This out of print Blue Note disc is sold directly through Amazon on CD-R media. The artwork and disc are low quality media which does not deserve a market price of $14.00. You should pay that amount for a first run REAL CD. A CD-R is NOT the same quality and does not stand the test of time. Do not be swayed. Blue Note should be ashamed to have allowed this to happen. I did not read the fine print when I ordered, and was under the impression that Blue Note had re-issued this title. Bless Don Pullen's estate, he probably doesn't see a cent of the profits. I love my CD's, but I'd rather download this as an MP3 and burn my own rather than fork over $14.00 for a lousy bootleg. Decent artwork. Clever printed topside. But it is not worthy of the musician it presents. Sorry."
1,Low Quality Product,"I bought these bags for travel space in my luggage. When I first tried out the bag, one ripped. During my travels, another ripped; and no, I was not over-stuffing them. This space-bag thing is a great idea, but the bag needs to be of higher quality so they last. I would not buy this particular item again."
3,Works great the first time,They are somewhat difficult to reuse because it is hard to reseal and repack after using once. Would be nice for a little more durability.
1,Most leaked,Bought these for atrip and was very dissapointed to find that they leaked. Try Samsonite picked them up at Olie's and they were great.
2,I liked the one large cube bag better,These didn't work well for me at all. I saved more space with the large single cube bag than I did with these smaller bags
5,great savings,anyone traveling and not using these needs to hear this!!! they are worth every penny and inch they save you!!
1,Great idea- doesn't really work,"I heard about these on tv and thought they'd be great for when I moved. IF they worked they would be great, but they don't! I bought about 25 various sized bags and only about 1/4 of them actually kept the air out. They appear to be working for the first day or 2 but slowly let air back in. Ended up have to repack all my stuff and throwing them away. Waste of time and money!"
4,I do like these travel space bags!,"I purchased these travel space bags for a long haul trup we are going to do in December 09. We are bringing gifts such as clothes, etc.. for family and have started the stuff we want to bring into these bags to condense our total amount of space in the luggage we are bringing(2 Dakine 60/40 convertible rolling duffle bags) we are bringing which I have attached a link toDakine 60/40 Convertible. The 1st carry on space bag broke as I was stuffing the clothes in and then when trying to seat it up was when the bag broke. On putting the clothes in the other travel bags, 2 other carry ons and 2 large stow away bags, these were useful and did not break. Overall, I would recommend this product but be careful as to the amount you try to put into the travel bags and when sealing it up."
2,Meh.,"I've had a couple of the travel bags from Eagle Creek for ages and wanted a few more so I thought I'd try the ""name brand."" I'm not impressed. Everything about these is flimsier - the plastic, the zipper, the valves. The first one I used, the zipper mechanism broke. The Eagle Creek ones also have some texture in the plastic which seems to hold the items in place better when you're rolling it so you get a flatter package. With these, items tend to slide down as you roll, so you end up with a lumpy wedge. As another commenter wrote, they do work better and end up with flatter packs if you sit or lie on them to squeeze the air out rather than rolling. I will probably just use these as big ziplocs for storing already-flat stuff in the garage."
4,Fits the job,"I picked these up to provide me a way to protect and store some emergency clothing. They make it easy to get the air out without the use of a vacuum, making it convenient in an emergency. It fits the need. I don't expect to be using these on a regular basis, so they should last."
1,completely worthless,"Not one of the 5 bags in this package would hold their seal, despite repeated attempts. I used a couple as oversized (and overpriced!!!) Ziploc bags, the rest went in the garbage."
1,Tears to easily,We bought a bunch of these as well as the vacuum ones recently for our international move and they didn't do a d*** bit of good! Half of them tore just by vacuuming them because the plastic would crinkle and just rip without anyone touching them. Then the ones that you roll don't roll back out so that you can lay them flat. Mights as well gone and gotten some trash bags and just vacuumed the air out of those!
2,Not as advertised.,These are not vacuum sealed bags as noted in the title. I cancelled another order once I found these just because I thought these were vacuum sealed - not happy.
4,Overall okay,"I purchased these bags to store yarn in a visible manner and also fit under a low day bed. I did not remember there were 3 sizes but the small ones suited yarn storage the best. It was easy to sort, close although some of the zippers had to be adjusted. I put bags on floor and gently rolled atop them toward the zipper and the air was removed. I put under the bed and the bag was ripped open by the small back end of a staple holding upholstery. My bad. I had to put duct tape on it to seal the holes. Repeating the process, the bags seemed to hold the vacuum with duct tape. The bags were flimsy hence minus 1 star )and subject to puncture. Must be careful and with packing the same could happen so pack duct tape."
5,Must Have Traveler Accessory,"We were amazed at how well these bags worked. If it weren't for weight issues we could have packed all of our clothes for a 14 day European vacation in one 26"" suitcase! We mainly used them on items we weren't worried about getting wrinkled but found that the wrinkles in the clothes packed in the bags relaxed quickly upon wearing the clothes. The bags also allowed us to bring extra ""just in case items"" such as a heavy jackets for unexpected bad weather. I also have two favorite pillows I sleep with that I miss when on vacation. We put them in the bags and they flattened out perfectly. Lastly, they make bringing home dirty laundry easy. Can't say enough good things about them. Easy to use over and over."
5,conveinent,I've used this product multiple times now and am pleased every time I use it. It helped me to only have to use a carry on for a weeks trip to California. Well worth the money spent.
3,Ok product,"Not entirely sure it really made really more room in the suitcase. Pretty easy to use, bags are not very big. Best to use for bulky items like a coat."
3,"works great, but quality is another story","My husband and I used these bags to pack for two weeks in a carry on! They really do work great at getting the excess air out and allowing you to pack more. The problem however is with the quality of the bag themselves. My husband and I used a total of 5 bags for our two week trip and with the packing, and unpacking a few times, 3 our of the 5 bags got a hole in them, deeming them useless unless we put duct tape over the hole. I was pretty disappointed.I would still recommend the product, but know a head of time that you have to be extra gentle with the bags (which we were!) and know that you'll only be able to get a few uses out of it before it rips/gets a hole."
4,"Works great, but could be thicker","It looks very fragile, as if it would tear if a stray fingernail scratched it or you tried to fit a little too much. No problems so far with moderate handling, but I wouldn't recommend getting rough with it. All it takes is a pin hole leak to render it useless.Air is vacuumed out easily just by firmly pushing on it. Like the other reviews, I have found slowly sitting on it to be a better method than rolling the air out. The included Sure Zip lock helps to seal the bag easily, but it can be detached and get lost so take good care of it! There's only one seal but I would have preferred two for redundancy.My biggest gripe is it's lack of vertical height. Though the dimensions are just nice, you can't really fit a lot into each bag before the seams look practically bursting. And like I mentioned, I dare not test its limits.In conclusion, great value if it's on offer but don't expect it to last a lifetime!"
1,STAY AWAY,"Unless you are brain dead, this software should be avoided at all cost. It is a book on disc and of no value whatsoever. Hard to install and worthless anyhow."
2,THIS PRODUCT NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"THIS PRODUCT IS MADE OF POOR QUALITY MATERIAL.THE METAL IS PAPER THIN AND IF I CHOSE TO, I PROBABLY COULD HAVE ROLLED IT UP LIKE MAKING A SNOW BALL.THE HANDLES ON THE SLIDING DOORS REQUIRE USING GLUE,WHICH IS PROVIDED IN A SMALL TUBE.THE CABINET CAME SLIGHTLY DENTED.WITH THE COST OF THE CABINET AND THE TIME TO PUT IT TOGETHER,THE TOTAL COST IN TIME AND MONEY RAISED THE COST OF THIS PRODUCT THREE FOLD.WHY DIDN,T I SEND IT BACK? THAT'S A QUESTION I KEEP ASKING MYSELF. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
2,great customer service,"Ordered and received medicine cabinet, but upon opening realized that it was damaged. Had just gone over the return policy date, but when I called Mr. Schwartz he listened and understood my problem. A refund was given that day. I appreciated the great customer service from Corner Hardware. They obviously care about their customers."
2,cheap construction/high price,This item is very poorly constructed for the price. The bathroom I bought it for has severe space limitations and it was the only medicine cabinet I could find that would fit or I would have returned it.
2,"No way was it 3""!",I was very disappointed in this product. It said it was 3 inches. There is no way it was. I tried to measure it and there was no part that was 3 inches. It was very flat. I have had other egg crates in the past and they were firm and thick. I would not recommend this product to anyone!!!
1,Not so sure,"This product arrived promptly and well packaged. It was beige, not blue/purple as shown in the image. After being unpacked for 48 hours and laid flat, it still looks very smooshed. Most of it is still under 1"" thick, and only about 1 foot of the topper at the head and foot have the 'egg crate' shape. I may give it a couple more days to expand, but if it doesn't, I'll have to return it as defective."
2,very dissappointed,"I was very disappointed with this product. It was supposed to be 3 inches thick. It was vaccumed pack so tightly, that is was 1/2"" thick. Foam won't come back after being packed to that extent. Amazon was very good at letting me return this product."
2,"3 "" foam topper??????? WHERE????","I purchased this to put on top of a hospital bed mattress for my brother who has cancer in his bones so he would have extra cushioning for his bed. It arrived I could barely keep it straight or flat long enough to stretch onto the bed. It DOES NOT reach the end of the twin mattress and is NO WAY 3 "" thick,not even close. I would return it but it is not worth paying the return shipping on it. VERY VERY Disappointed in this."
2,Disappointed,"Wished I would have purchased the much less expensive ones I saw at a dollar store. I chose this one, because of it's claim to be 3"" thickness. This came rolled so tightly that it was barely 1/4"" in some spots. Nowhere was it 3"". Even after leaving it out to fluff up in the air. I think the only way to get it to a more normal thickness would be to wet it, which I'm not about to do. Also, it does not entirely cover the mattress of a twin. Much smaller. Because of the way it was packaged it was too difficult to try to send back. It was supposed to be a replacement for an older one on the bed..I ended up just putting it over top the old one to get more thickness. Would not spend this much money on one again..very disappointed."
4,Amore's bed,I bought this to replace my dog's mattress. It worked great and it was much cheaper than buying him a new bed.
5,FIN,It's just what I needed. It helps me sleep better. The detailed discription is what the mattress is. Just right.
5,Great mattress pad,This mattress pad is wonderful!!!! It made my bed so much more comfortable!!! I would recommend this to anyone who wants their bed to be softer.
3,Met needs,It was what we were looking for. It was the right thickness for us to use. It's a pretty good product.
4,Dr. advised using mattress and chair pad to prevent bedsore.,Found out you don't have to be bed ridden to get a bed sore. This mattress pad was easy to cut to mattress size and to cut extra chair pads. It helped relieve tailbone bone pain and now I sleep and sit pain free.
5,Great product!,I went looking for this product locally for a several weeks and was unable to find it. Found it quickly on here and was excited how quickly it arrived. We layed them out on some beds and they fluffed out nicely overnight and ready for use in the classroom the next day. It was exactly what the professor was looking for!
4,Travel and Insight,"Father Hesburgh's tenure as president of Notre Dame coincided with a time of extraordinary change in the world in general and in University education in particular. Having gotten a sense of the man from reading The Hesburgh Papers (Higher Values in Higher Education), Travels with Ted and Ned gave me a frank and often humorous look at the day to day life of Father Hesburgh and his close friend and colleague Father Ned Joyce as they experience the first year of their retirement. The details of their tour of the United States and then the world provide an insight to Father Hesburgh's thinking and vision. He is a leader of unusual energy, animated by clear and practical values, and a priest first and foremost. The book is a refreshing view of two men who had great influence in their lives yet maintained a genuine humility, and a genuine friendship."
3,Not So Thick,"The description is a little lacking and the given dimensions are wrong. The thickness (depth of the panel, not the shipping box it comes in) is more like .5"", not 5.37"". Plastic... it is definitely that and this would have been good to mention in the seller's description. The surface is pebbled which adds to the cheap motel ambiance. I wish the manufacturer would make these in a wider range of dimensions: the hole in my wall was closer to 14"" x 9"" but I'm stuck with this huge hole and panel now (until I decide to do the job right and patch the hole with wallboard). The panel feels flimsy and looks like what it is (cheap), and I would have preferred a hinged door so there'd be no danger of the hatch falling into the hole."
4,"Good overall, a few problems","Hard to feel home keys through it, slightly too large for the top row of keys, but works well overall."
1,Fragile,"The first blow to a piece of wood make the handle loose within the axe?I saw that axe is made with a kind of rubber shock absorber, wich make the mechanical link ""handle to steel axe"" a bit unusual. I did not try again to use this axe. Is someone can tell me that axe is suppose to work that way?"
1,Ughh! TERRIBLE!,"This was the cheesiest costume I'd ever seen! The color was bright and just plain ugly. It looked terrible on my little sister and it has a wierd attached plastic broach thing with a picture of Belle on it with her bare chest all hanging out! Ewww! It's much worse than it looks in the picture! My entire family thought it was the most unattractive costume ever. It was NOT worth the money we paid for it. Trust me, this is a disgusting confection you don't want to put your little girl in! Disney will do anything to make an extra buck, even at the expense of little girls' wearing clothes with innapropriately dressed women sitting on the front for all to stare and gawk at. This is the last thing we want our little girls to have as role models, especially at such a young age. THIS IS A TERRIBLE, FREAKY COSTUME!"
5,Long time K&N user,I have been using k&n; filters for years. I needed a replacement because this filter is exposed on my motorcycle and it was damaged accidentally.Since I was replacing the same with the same it was a no brainer. I bought it here because of the great price.
3,It is OK to have it.,It is ok to have it. It is easy to use. But it is BAD if something is wrong with your camcorder and you have to contact Sharp's customer support. You don't get any help as you should get.
4,"I still like the design, even with the problems....here's why:","I have been doing lots of amateur photography and occasionally have a need for all kinds of angles. The design of this camera allows you to set it on the floor and have a stable picture. That one quailty has endeared me to this model. Earlier models had the flaws of only being able to sense the remote control from front or back, and the battery did not recharge internally. This model allows remote control whether you are in front of or behind the camera for start/stop and adjusting wide/narrow focus. The only knocks I have on this camera are the lack of a light, for poor lighting, and durability (repair) issues. I have gone through two of these models, but will always try to own at least one, as long as I can find them...even though I also have other more advanced cameras with independent light sources and low maintenace/repair issues.For an artist, it is all about getting the right shot."
3,"Not a Toy, its a MODEL","First of all,its not a toy, its not meant to be a toy, used as a toy, played with, tested for durability and thrown the stairs like hotwheels. Clearly, its a MODEL car. Its meant to be built, then looked at in awe of its awesomeness. I was not to highly satisfied with the fact that the pictures are all in color, and i was lead on to believe all of the parts were colored already, but, then again, this was only my second model. It contains no paint, or painted parts whatsoever. Thirdly, the stickers are as useless as tits on a boar. They are 2 small, and there is no way to peel the them off to acually apply them. Overall, i made it as a gift, so it was from the <3, not the wallet, maybe i got what i payed for. Overall, took me about 3 hours total putting it together, pretty simple build."
5,Those were the days!,"I purchased this volume specifically, as opposed to the other specials because David Soul was a guest singer on this - I wasn't disappointed. The special was shot on location in Hawaii and the Captain and Tennille were shown in various spots on the island and gave brief histories of different landmarks. Although this special was very different to their typical variety show, it was a nice change. Hawaii is beautiful and at the end of the show, all of the guest are together singing with Toni and separately, including Kenny Rogers. Toni does a great ""Back To The Island"" also. If you are a fan, this is a great way to remember the 70's and how popular the variety shows were."
1,Not A Good Investment,"Before I purchased this, I read all the reviews and compared the different machines. That method usually works for me, but not this time.The quarters continually jammed in the exit slot which required the machine to be turned off and completely emptied. When you power off the unit, any coins still in the sleeves are no longer considered as dispensed. That means the machine treats the coin sleeves as empty. It will keep dropping that coin until it has dispensed the amount needed to fill an empty coin sleeve. If you do not empty the partial sleeves it will keep dropping change like a slot machine.It also kept dropping pennies into the nickel sleeve. After emptying each nickel roll, I found at least two pennies in each. It over filled the pennies.As with anything mechanical, I expected an occasional jam. However, this was constant. Plus, the need to check each roll after it was filled doubled the work. I do not recommend this unit at all."
1,Junk,Less than 1 years old and it is useless. Motor no longer turns. I thought Royal Sovereign was a good name. Made in China.
4,Not A Bad Machine,"I used this item on and off over the years after accumulating change that I don't want to give to Coinstar centers. Unit is a little fussy, and can jam if fed too many coins, and the drop sorting area can also be fussy if the coin tubes are not perfectly open around the edges. But other than that, the unit counts, sorts, and gives a final tally of all coins processed. The bank never gave me a call saying that I shorted them change"
1,Not worth it,Wasn't quite the style I was looking for. It felt like wearing a tight spandex suit. The same day I got it was the same day I sent it back.
4,promising new author? I think so,"The Fab 5 has a good hook -- childhood friends reuniting at a funeral and reminiscing about the old times. It gives us a decent look at black people who made... and without using all the stereotypes of how we can make it (nobody went to jail, nobody is a drug deale no one is stupid, etc.). The good parts of the story happen in flashback, though, in the context of basketball, and this is some of the best sportswriting I've ever seen. You really feel like you're in the game.I'll buy his next one."
2,Not good,Advertised to curl and condition and it does neither. My hair was a bit wavier but oh so dry. NOT a good conditioner.
4,love April Woo,"I enjoyed this Woo novel and I did not see the ending coming. It kept me reading, an easy read."
4,Chilled downbeat coolness,"The tracks 1-4 are really mellow and downtempo, feels like the tracks 5-8 make up the body of this album, they are all really good in their own ways. Track 9 seemed somehow too long.I think I liked ""Kin"" slightly more than this, because ""Kin"" had kind of a rougher edge to it, more intense. If I could somehow inject a touch of additional chaos into ""Terra Firma"", I think I'd like it even more, but it's still really good as it is, good as both listening and background music. I'd give it about 4.4 stars.."
4,Heard on Siruis Satellite Spa 73 in Spr 2006,"The cut ""Bodega Bay"" caught my attention as you can view names & titles of artists on Siruis Radio's. Couldn't find CD in Any record store so I decided to look up artist title ONLINE & Voila ended up here!Little did I know that other 'cuts' from this album like ""Shine"" & ""The CUT"" (song title) would be so well done as to warrant AIR TIME onanyones New Age or Jazz Station.Where has this group been hiding ? Along with Omnimotion which I ordered from Amazon. Music you just can't find anywhere else!!BTW I originally tried to order from a secondary(cheaper-used) site, but after waiting 2 weeks the Omnimotion CD never showed up. Never order anything from anyone other then the Zon unless you are prepared to wait 3-4 weeks or hear all kinds of excuses. After complaining to AMEX though my credit was to me in 48 hours. They said it was 'lost mail' If it wasn't for this SNAFU would have given them 5 stars."
3,"It'sa not the case, it's the phone.",I bought the case because I couldn't hear or feel the phone ring or vibrate in my pocket. The case did not help. The C261 just has a very quiet ring. Not the cases fault.
2,Editing is Terrible,"The editing in this novel is so poor that it impairs comprehension. There is a combination of what could be termed ""typos"", missing words, and incorrect verb tenses. The plot appears engaging but I am continally distracted by my desire for a red pen. Shouldn't someone have done that job before the text got to a paying reader?"
2,Not good at all,"I have to be honest, I did not finish reading this book. Believe me, I tried! But this was badly written and it drove me crazy! At one point the hero's name is changed to another and that was the end of it for me.The plot is unusual, and if you can get past the bad writing I am sure that this book is at least an average read, but as it is I would not waste my time and read all of it."
5,"Wonderful, exciting read","A great book, well worth the time. I loved the characters and how well developed they were. Wonderful exchange and chemistry and very believable, specially considering the restraints in proper behavior during that era. An exciting, well written novel with characters that you laugh out loud about, grin wickedly, and cheer for the strong willed, very intelligent and fearless leading lady that does what is right by humanity standards, if not by social standards. Will definitely be reading more books written by this author."
5,The best Regency I've ever read,"I have generally found single-title romances to be much superior, but this Regency is is better than many single titles. The heroine is intelligent, witty, charming, and practical. Her relationships are mature and sensible. The hero realizes he has some growing to do even before he meets her; she becomes (sometimes without their realizing it) the major impetous to his change. He even realizes that she's more intelligent than he is. Yet they are a good match...soul mates.There's also humor in addition to some very realistic soul-searching and the disbelieving responses of others to someone who's trying to make positive changes in his life. Darn near perfect in every way."
4,Walking shoe review,"The walking shoe is made for just that - walking. There's less arch support than I had hoped for, but it's still an excellent shoe. I do alot of treadmill walking in the winter, and it's very comfy and fits very well.When I need to run, I use my running shoes for that. I try and keep my athletic shoes separate from the ""sneakers"" that I use to run around town in."
3,Good but unfinished,The novels were exciting with a steady head of pressure building non-stop till the end. It left me wanting more. Too many questions were left unanswered and the story ended abruptly as if the author had tired of the telling.
4,within and beyond the writing process in the secondary engli,One thing that I liked about this book was the broad range of information about writing. I enjoyed the research paper section because it helped me organize and write my own research paper. I also like how I can just look up certain objectives and not have to read the whole book. This book covers everything from the aspects of writing with every type of writing and also you learn grammar and language. I recommend this book for any teacher and especially English teacher who may need to refer to a text to brush up on what they learned though out school. Also this is a good book for anyone who even likes to write and wants to write well. It will help you become an great writer and is an easy and great read.
4,Helpful Hints!,"This book is very beneficial for anyone who is-or wants-to pursue a career in teaching English. Within and Beyond the Writing process in the Secondary English Classroom, by Dorman, Rosen, Wilson, and Rosen, affectively explains methods of teaching different forms of writing. Journal entries, analyzing literature, essays, research papers, and grammar are only some of the topics covered in this book. Although this book is written like a manual, it provides easy, step-by-step methods, as well as suggested worksheets and exercises to use. Overall, I felt this book was full of helpful information and ideas that will make any form of writing easier to teach."
2,Within and beyond the Writing Process in the Secondary Engli,"Review of ""Within and Beyond the Writing Process in the Secondary English Classroom"" Written by Reade W. Dornan, Louis Matz Rosen, and Marilyn Wilson.I found this book hard to read because it was boring and repetitive, I may have enjoyed this book more if I had not read so many similar books in the past. It is more like reference book rather than a sit down read book. The print and layout of the book made for an even more boring book.I would recommend this book for secondary education teacher as a reference book and college students. It is a book to keep in your library at home to enhance your approach to rhetoric, expressive writing and writing for social change. It is a great book to refresh your memory about how to write a paper and enhance your skills in writing."
2,this is a good resource,"Review of Within and Beyond the Writing Process in the Secondary English Classroomby: Reade W. Dornan, Lois Matz Rosen and Marilyn WilsonThis would be a fantastic research book for all educators who teach older students English as a second language. It is an excellent source to explain the latest theories in teaching this subject. The authors provided nice examples to use in the classroom setting. It also gives suggestions that you can use to try to motivate your students.I would not recommend this book as an enjoyable read because it has small print that fills the pages. I found it very difficult to work my way through this book. It would be a nice resource to keep in your library at home, but do not expect a quick and easy read. Although I did not enjoy it, I can appreciate its usefulness in the classroom."

3,An Okay book,"This book wasn't the best I have read, but it was still good. I liked the way the author explain it. A good read."
4,Good Beginnings,"The Diskords have good beginnings and show a lot of potential. Mixing the sounds of Minor Threat, Bad Brains, The Circle Jerks The Spits, The Ramones and The Sex Pistols, with Dead Kennedys like wit behind lyrics, the whole sound is tied together with catchy beats and good riffs. This is a CD worth having in your collection, as it will most certainly become a collectors item when the band hits it big. Watch out for these guys."
4,Pretty Darned Funny,I picked this up on a whim at my local library. This is some pretty funny and surreal stuff-what comics are supposed to be about. It has a style that harkens back to the early days of comic strips where there were less hardfast rules. Forget about Dilbert and Garfield and especially the wretched Sally Forth and try and find a copy of Reid Fleming.
5,"Concise,loaded with information, humor","The author did her homework. Most of us approach pregancy with little information that is of importance to what, how and the hard questions that we're naive to ask about. The book answered many that i had, plus. It is beautifully illustrated, filled with wisdom and practical information. thank you"
2,It's no Hegel,"Find out how we will achieve peace through war and continual conflict. This is an important, though troubling work of political philosophy by the great thinker, though it is mediocre when compared to the historical dialectics of Hegel. For evidence of Kant's racism/ethnocentrism, read the section on Cosmopolitanism, in which Kant effectively excludes all humans outside of the Ancient Greece and the West from the human project. Well, one can't assume a great transcendental thinker will also be enlightened in politics; sad considering the ""Enlightenment"" is one of Kant's primary concerns in the book."
1,DOESN''T WORK,"I paid 12.00 dollars for this item at a beach side convenience store and it just doesn't work at all. It does not stand up ON it's own for a child to fill it and no matter what you fill it with ie.( sand, water, rice) the mechanisms just don't move! The hole seems big enough to make it move but it just doesn't and your child will be very dissappointed."
1,I've never seen such bad acting. . .,"This is a horribly produced, directed and acted short movie. Believe it or not, I actually watched all 24 excruciating minutes of it. As a pastor of a college church, I can guarantee that I will never use this movie in our church, except to show how bad Christians are at producing media that is relevant and relatable to where young people are really coming from. I think the subject matter, addiction to [...] among Christians, is an important, often hidden issue, but . . . this movie! I just couldn't take it seriously. If I played this dvd in my church, I wouldn't be able to get people stop laughing at how riduculously bad it is. It is maybe the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie.I do appreciate being sent a free copy to preview, I would have been really upset had I paid money for it. Thanks for the encouragement to write a review on Amazon for your DVD. . . I hope this is what you were looking for."
4,Perfect Character Actors,"MGM's David Copperfield was a great opportunity to make use of some Hollywood's great character actors, and the film does so to great effect. Of course, the film is based on Dicken's famous novel, although the story is condensed. Freddie Bartholomew stars as the title character, a young boy eventually orphaned who meets a host of characters as he grows up alone. Although Bartholomew was actually one of the better child actors in film history, he never captures this character and his performance sometimes seems forced and ineffective. However, he is surrounded by an incredible group of actors playing memorable supporting characters. Basil Rathbone, W.C. Fields, Edna May Oliver, and Roland Young are all excellent in roles that only Dickens could have written. They make the movie. The film features the usual MGM production values and is well worth a look."
4,Stellar cast,"I bought this video primarily because of the casting and the acting. I had seen the movie before and was delighted to own a copy. To portray any Dickens' novel in two hours and eleven minutes would be completely impossible so there were huge omissions one was the period when David attended school where he met Steerforth. In the book Steerforth is completely self-centered, but befriends and protects David from harsh treatment while at school. In the movie David merely says he met Steerforth at school.Anyone who reads the book after seeing this version will forever see and hear the characters as portrayed by W.C. Fields, Freddie Bartholomew, Edna May Oliver and the rest of the cast. I treasure my copy and will watch it many times."
3,"Fun addition to the kids HP collection, Expensive though for a toy","I am not sure why it is so hard to find HP toys in the USA but it is. Which is sad because the kids at my house love to play HP. This is really more for collectors of action figures, but it was the best I could find for my kids for fantasy play. The wands are so tiny they get lost immediately, but the kids just replace them with toothpicks."
2,Only one good song...,"I picked up this disk in Hawaii (not surprising considering that this is a Hawaiin group)in the late 90s. The only song I liked on it was ""Spread So Thin."" However, that song is really good and shows that these guys have a lot of potential."
2,Lots of trouble with this roaster,"I have had to have this roaster replaced 3 times now due to over heating and mechanical failures. My first batch made it about 17 minutes then the machine stopped. Z&D customer service was great but the second machine only made about 10 batches (over a couple of weeks) and failed in the same manner. When the 3rd one failed I tired of the personal relationship I was forming with the UPS man so being a handy sort I found the problem to be a thermal fuse that was over-heating. I replaced this part and things were fine until the spindle that drives the auger wore out. I've replaced this and that but I have finally grown weary of fixing this junk appliance. (4 fuses, a belt and spindle- enough is enough!) I have two other friends that have had similar experiences so it's not just my bad luck. I wish it worked better because the price is nice and it's simple to use when it works."
4,Great to roast your own coffee! This product needs competition though!,"The Z&D Roaster is great, but not built to last. The smell of coffee roasting is all you get from this. No smoke as the air is circulated and I believe it is one of the only units of this kind that has a catalyst to keep the smoke smell virtually gone. All you smell is the aroma of fresh roasted coffee - even coffee drinkers love that. I used mine very regularly, but it has been about 18 months and just like the other reviewers. Bam! The fan blade broke in 2. I have replaced the glass cylinder twice at $20 a pop. I didn't catch the blade break in time and my unit melted slightly to where it is trashed. I would consider this product value to be about $60, quality wise, but since they have little competition out there, they can ask the $149. I am buying another. I have considered the I-Roast 2 but it costs more and I'm not sure about the smoke issue. At least this round, I have a few backup parts from the old one."
2,Chamber cracks,"I've had the roaster 2 years. Have had to replace the glass chamber 3 times. The last chamber cracked after 2 roastings. Customer service said we don't cover the chambers, we won't help you. The coffee roasts alright. Sometimes light, sometimes dark. We never know what we will get. My husband still loves it but I'm going to find a better product."
2,"Nice roasts, dangerous build quality issues","While this roaster works, it produces nice medium-dark roasts, and a good amount beans for a 1 or 2 coffee drinker household. It's a bit loud, but the relatively smokeless operation means you can run it anywhere that's fairly well ventilated.The problem with these roasters is the terrible build quality. I repeatedly had the central auger jam. If not freed up immediately, the jam will cause the beans to heat unevenly and catch on fire. I had this happen on two occasions, ruining the roaster both times. The second time, I was past warranty."
2,Doesn't last long,"I have had my Z & D roaster since Christmas 2004. I had to send it back for warranty work within the first 6 months. They took care of everything, but I was out the roaster for the duration and of course the shipping expense. It just broke again yesterday and it is well out of the warranty period. While it worked, it worked just fine and we were happy, but I'm with the other reviewers. A $150 appliance should last longer than a year and a half."
4,Bold Art and Bolder Women.,"For those who are nto familiar with Eric Stanton this is a good starting point, the art work is erotic rather than pornographic, the stories all based around dominant women, some violent but nothing that would leave a permanent scar!Stories, of which there are a few, are in comic strip form, all color. The women are beautiful and statuesque the male characters range from the stereotypical bully to meek and mild.Overall the book is beautifully presented and a great addition to any collection."
2,persistent problems outweigh size advantage,I have had my V505 for about 6 months now. I have persistent problems with the touch pad as so many have noted here. But I also have problems with the space bar not registering a touch on the right end of the bar so words run on without spaces if you use your right thumb to type the space bar.Another frequently occuring and annoying problem is the cursor randomly jumps to odd places in a document so I find myself typing in the middle of a sentence two lines above or some where else than where it should be.Some days I hate this computer. I wish I had bought a IBM T40.
1,Endless touchpad hardware problems,"I bought this notebook. At first it seemed to me fabulousbut then I discovered it has hardware problems with thetouchpad like explained by other reviewers: touchpad clicking continuoslyon its own , going up, down etc..Sony should do something about this, as most of v505 ownershave this kind of problems !Also I found the case is of bad quality, just plastic.Don't trust pictures and go touch goods before buying."
2,Everything but the Touchpad,"I love the styling and the nice features of the V505's but Sony should issue a recall to fix the touchpad's. I'm an IT professional and I've dealt with 100's of laptops. The V505 series has the worst touchpad I've ever seen. I personally own a V505AX and I can attest to the horrors of the touchpad's from the series. Very poor, less then useless... I wish I could find the time to send it back.Steve MSan Francisco, CA"
1,Don't bother with a SONY Notebook,"I bought this one from Amazon.com 4 months ago. Here are the problems I had to deal with:1. Yes, unsurprisingly I am having the same touchpad problems. It is erratic!!! It sometimes does not work and sometimes jumps from one corner to the other corner of the screen.2. Battery life is too short.3. This Notebook does NOT include RECOVERY CD's. So, if you have a problem with your software you have nothing to do!!! Customer support will tell you to order and pay for recovery CD's!!!?Don't go for the style and the name and buy an IBM T40."
2,Sony Vaio PCG V505BX Laptop Review,"I am a computer programmer. This Laptop is small and has a lot of feature, but the video card only has 16 megs of rams. Which make you can not do anything with high graphical operation.My friend bought 1 of this laptop. She had reinstall another version of Win XP Pro. The Win XP keep freeze randomly. The freeze problem occur, because the video card rams are not enough to run Win XP with high graphical performace. So I don't really suggest this laptop to anybody, except people using this laptop to run linux or other os' without graphical interfaceRegardsReece Mak"
5,what a nice job!!!,"When Sony sent me an email about this laptop, I knew my old IBM would be replaced very soon. Sony can never disappoint you in any ways. It is so light but powerful, the screen looks nice, and the keys are very comfortable. my school has wireless connection and i use this laptop in school with high speed internet, it just makes everything so much easier. 40G is not that increditable big, but good enough for ppl who wants to bring this lil guy on trip. Sony once again rocks."
1,Very unreliable Laptop,I will not write a lot here. This laptop is the absolute worst I have ever owned in terms of reliability. Owned it for over a year and would NEVER buy another Sony laptop.
3,Good look - but few problems,"Looks nice, small, thin.. but having problems with the CD-ROM.Sometimes doesnt work well (slow, freeze... cant read..)"
3,"Nice feats, poor quality?","As others have said, nice machine, but the mousepad is quirky on mine too. Support and quality do not seem to be hallmarks of Sony Vaios....I'll be returning mine for a full refund (only had a couple days).I'll probably buy IBM...have had many thru work, and they are almost always rock solid (if pricey)."
1,"If you need wireless, don't buy this computer","It may look great, but the only thing worse than this computer's wireless card is Sony's rude and unhelpful customer service. The internal wireless card in mine is defective, and I've met at least 3 other people who have had the same problem. Sony refuses to fix it on the grounds that they don't make the card itself. I ended up having to buy a pcmcia style wireless card.Also, it closes programs at random, and the on/off key is badly located (on the bottom front edge), so it's really easy to put the computer into hibernate mode by accident while you're working. The battery life is fantastic, but that doesn't really matter when nothing else is working correctly.Don't waste your time or your money on this computer."
1,Closes Programs Periodically,"The v505bx randomly closes or minimizes windows such as the web browser, Outlook, control panel window, etc. I'd be working on something and it would just close. No error messages or anything. What ever I was working on, is just lost.So, I took it back to Circuit City with no problems. They were out of stock on another one. So, I went to Best Buy and purchased one with the exact same problem. The problems started before I installed anything or connected to the internet.Best Buy charged a 15% restocking fee which I am trying to fight. But, until Sony gets this worked out, I would stay away from this computer."

But, until Sony gets this worked out, I would stay away from this computer."
4,"A Surprise - a refreshing take on a ""plus size"" romance","I had seen this particular title come up on several ""best"" lists for a romance with a plus size heroine. What I expected was a fluffy Hq usual type of story and what I got was a whole lot more. It was entertaining, a true page turner, as I stayed up to finish the book. That the focus of the story wasn't on the heroine losing weight, AND as a bonus, was already fairly accepting of her size (well, no more insecure than I believe many women are, no matter the number on the scale), was fantastic. It was more about the hero and the heroine learning to open up to another human being, something that can be difficult, no matter what size you are. It was a lovely little story and I'm glad I read it."
3,.,"The books revolves around people working in Alzheimer's research and Davis did a great job of utilizing that. There were real three dimensional descriptions of how the people involved dealt with the disease that, although the book itself was short and the romance was silly, the book had real depth."
4,Good but not great,"When Layla was described, I pictured someone like Kathleen Turner or Kirstie Alley. Voluptuous with a sexy voice etc... but so much of a deal was made about ""how could he be with her"" that it was distracting. I LOVE the idea of a heroine who is not model thin, but both Layla and Ethan seemed to have trouble with it for a while. I really liked how they had other things in their lives, interesting jobs, sailing, biking...they were interesting characters. But dump the friend Bill! What a jerk. I'd like to see more books with larger woman as heroines. This is a nice start, but I'd like to see their size be an issue to address not an overwhelming obstacle....then again I'd like to see that in real life!"
4,"It's fun, easy, intelligent read.","By the time I read this, I already knew that the female lead -- Layla -- wasn't going to be the sort to wallow in her weight but simply be herself, weight and all. I loved that about her. I thought the book was intelligent, the treatment of Alzheimer's was dignified and blunt, and that the characters had really good chemistry. Layla's weight was a great touch or realism to a romantic lead. I'd definitely recommend it -- it's a solid romance novel."
5,"Wolves, Eskimos, and Bush Pilots","I worked in Alaska for a short while over 30 years ago and commissioned a bush pilot to take me into the wilderness. The pilot was low on gasoline and I did not know if I would come out of this alive. The initial scenes with the government biologist and the pilot looked almost exactly what I experienced. Awesome.This movie surprised me. I found a reference to it in a book on Eskimos and Film and decided to try it out. The photography was sensational, the wolf scenes are very believable, and the transformation of a person lacking wilderness experience into someone capable of surviving on his own is honest.The film gives mixed portrayals of both the white men and the Eskimos - something unusual in films about the Arctic. If you have not heard of this outstanding film, give it a try."
5,Wonderful!!!,"This movie really makes you see the sides of many types of people, it truly hits reality, knowing that this is how people are in real life and not just on the screen. The scenery was wonderful, if for no other reason one should rent it for this reason alone.An older movie, but a really great movie!"
4,Never Cry Wolf -,"The Soul of Jeramiah Johnson and the Humour of Little Big Man. Closely follows the book by Farley Mowat(?) Great sinister characters, heroes and humour...although it is even better once you have read the book. I would rank this well within my top 30 movies."
5,It will give you chills,I have never seen another movie that has inspired me like this one. It has been 16 years since the first time i have seen it and i have been trying to get my hands on a copy ever since. There is nothing more powerful than seeing the true natural instincts of a human left in the middle of nowhere to learn and survive. The scenery is outstanding as well as the music. It is a perfect movie for all ages to enjoy. Educational and dramatic.By far my favorite movie of all time.
3,Interesting movie if you love wolves,"I read this book and I loved it and I enjoyed the movie as well. Although I'm not sure that someone who doesn't absolutely love wolves would appreciate it. If memory serves me correctly, it ended a bit different from the book. But overall, a worthwhile watch."
5,Great Movie,My husband was pleasantly surprised that Amazon had this movie on DVD. Good movie--G rating!
5,Never Cry Wolf,"Never Cry Wolf is an excellent movie. The movie depicts life in the Yukon through the eyes and narration of a somewhat ill-equipped scientist sent to the Yukon to study wolves and their predation on Caribou. What he discovers instead is that the wolves are not decimating the caribou population, they are surviving largely on mice. This movie has many subtle but powerful messages about man and our coexistence with the environment."
4,"Look out, Mickey, they're coming for you!","About a young scientist (played by Charles Martin Smith) who goes to the Arctic to study wolves, their survival, and their effect on the caribou herds (he proves they are not killing the caribou, as it had been assumed). He is a fledgling in the wilds, but learns to become as resourceful as the wolves. He notices the wolves eating mice, and begins to do the same himself - a supreme irony in this Disney film. The first half is excellent, compelling and beautiful to watch; but the second half is marred by an incessant pounding away on a man-as-encroacher bad guy message and a confusing man-as-wolf Indian mysticism presentation. It's wonderfully photographed, though, and the soundtrack is stunning."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A dull film whose conservationalist message is often eschewed in favor of long stretches of Charles Martin Smith alone in the wilderness, Never Cry Wolf has bad narration, poor characters, long stretches of tedium and a jumbled moral: stay away."
2,Stop Crying Wolf,"Its too bad the movie is based upon too many outright lies and twistings of the truth, as is the rest of Farley Mowats work."
1,Disgusting vulgar & pointless,"I've only seen this movie once, and that was too many times. The plot is slow moving at best, and the message of the film is lost in the presentation. Unless you like to see a grown man & an over-grown dog get in a peeing contest or want to see a naked human running across barren tundra of the frozen North don't even bother with this piece of garbage. Save your time & money and don't watch this film."
5,Excellent movie,"As one would expect, a number of alterations have been made in adapting the story for film, but overall, the movie remains faithful to the essence of Farley Mowat's book. In the end, the movie, like the book, is a scathing indictment of Anglo-European ignorance about and contempt for nature. Very much worth watching, and an excellent educational resource. There is, however, some nudity--although nothing overtly offensive. In terms of the extras included with the full screen dvd: there are none. This is certainly a disappointment, but in the end not all that important."
1,The money making this movie was completely wasted.,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.There is no plot.There is no character development.There is no interesting dialogue.There is not one thing of interest in this movie.Please, please, please, do not waste your money on this movie. It will not be worth it.I think that this is the worst movie of all time, quite frankly.(note: many people think that the beautiful scenery is nice. It is nice, but if you want to see some Alaskan vistas check you local calendar store.)"
4,A Decent Grab-Bag Collection.,"""The Pink Opaque"" is an odds-and-ends compilation which pulls together tunes from previous albums and EPs, as well as two rare tracks: a remix of ""Wax and Wane"" and ""Millimillenary,"" which appeared on a 45 with an old issue of the Brit music mag NME. Covering a period from 1982-85, ""The Pink Opaque"" is a decent collection that captures the dark atmospherics and etheral touches of the Cocteau Twins, mostly distinguished by the lovely (if inchoherent) warblings of its lead singer Elizabeth Fraser. The remix of ""Wax and Wane"" is more aggressive in tone and eliminates the drum machine that surfaces on the original. ""Hitherto"" moves along with gloomy guitars and crisp drums, while ""Aikea Guinea"" stands out with Fraser in good vocal form. While I'd normally suggest that the casual listener grab their individual LPs, ""The Pink Opaque"" is a worthy consideration for Cocteau completists."
2,The Late Poetry of Meng Chiao,"I bought this book on the rcommendation that it is a good sample of translated Meng Chiao poems to use as a guide, because I translateJade Culture of China, and Chinese poetry that relates to the Jade Culture. But I found the translations poor for the high standards of a published work.Translated works on Chinese Poetry need more commentary, and show the Chinese. This work did not.If need be I can provide an example or two of a translation problem with this work.FrankGo with the flow the river knows."
3,good with great cast,I saw this movie on Fox Movie Channel. It's a pretty good western with a great cast.
3,Good as a double chalk board,"I totally agree that you cannot clean dry erase markers off the board, I have scrubbed and scrubbed it and the white board is now stained. So we now use the white side for chalk aswell. It is sturdy and very easy to put together. I am happy with it overall as I only paid $6.99 for it. Had I paid full price I would be less happy. I'd reccomend buying it if you want a double chalk board."
4,A constructive book...,"Callas provides good musical guidance on many famous soprano arias. Reading the book almost brings her back to life.This is a good book if you're looking for some musical insights from one of the greatest musicians. She talks about technique, expression, and the characters themselves. This book would probably not interest you if you're looking for a biography of Callas. This book is more focused on the music and her insights."
5,Could we have lived before?,"It sure would explain a lot. Ms. Carol Bennett has done a marvelous job weaving fact with fiction in telling the story of Jennie Gravit. The reoccurring themes and emotions keep the souls of the characters coming back to play out the relational drama of everyday living on the farm as well as in the city.But all is not in the past and told of past lives. There is also tales of the future. I found myself wanting to dream more vividly and hold on to the vapor of memory before the vale of forgetfulness fell over my mind as I awoke each day.Carol quotes well-known persons to relate her tale and anchor her concepts. The dreaming butterfly and girl are still floating in my mind now.If you believe in the metaphysical aspects of life, you will want to read this novel. If you don't, I think you will still find the story entertaining and magical.Joanne Lyons, authorHealing after Divorce...: It's About Time!The Tower Apartments"
3,Life after????,My book club read this book and it was favorably reviewed. It spurred a lot of conversation about the after-life. Interesting read although I thought the writing was marginal. Good food for thought.
5,Delightful Introduction To Reincarnation,"Not being familiar with the topic of reincarnation, I found JENNIE'S REPRISAL to be a delightful introduction to the subject. It certainly got me to thinking about the possibility of having lived before!"
2,Disappointed,"After reading the reviews, I purchased the Kindle version of this book. I am disappointed in how the Kindle book came through, quite a few errors. It doesn't look professional, and I felt like I paid for a free e-book.Having been a student of metaphysics most of my adult life, I was not as captivated by this book as I thought I'd be. I think for someone new to these concepts it is a creative way to share these teachings. I had a hard time staying motivated to finish the book."
2,Is it me or...,I don't know if I am in a reading slump or not. I have loved all of Ms. Guhrke's books. This one never really took off for me. It was just ok. Kinda blah. Is it because the change of seasons? Am I kinda getting depressed because winter is setting in? Or is it just a so-so story? I guess I was expecting more...
3,"Stilted, yet satisfying","This is the first book I've read by Guhrke, and I was all set to say it would be the last until I got to the ""black moment"" and found myself tearing up. She packs a whalop, no getting around it. Her dialogue is stiff, and her characters have long, dry, unnatural conversations (in which she refuses to use contractions, so everyone says ""do not"" and ""can not"" which always bothers me), and the child is overly precocious (not her musical ability, but the way she speaks), but it was worth the couple of hours I spent on it. Can't wait to track down Guilty Pleasures."
4,Really pulled my heart strings!,"I do not know where to start here. This book had me laughing in one moment, ripping at my heart the next. Dylan and Grace not only had their share of obstacles to overcome, along comes Dylan's daughter that he had no idea he had fathered. Isabel has her mind made up that there WILL be a family and that's all there is to it! Dylan comes to realize that there is more to his world than music. He slowly opens his heart, Grace slowly learns to trust, and Isabel is the glue sticking them together. What a ride reading this book was. I was brought to tears several times while reading and had to stop and pull myself together to continue. A great love story!"
4,Memoirs narrated by veterans,"This short (50 minutes) documentary is narrated by WWll veterans of the US Merchant Marine, US Naval Armed Guard, and steelworkers of the Kaiser shipbuilding yards. The video, with its rare black-and-white footage, spotlight on veterans, and music soundtrack, is of the same general quality as televised episodes presented on ""The History Channel"". Its focus is on the importance of the convoy system in delivery to our Allies of desperately-needed supplies. Unbeknownst to the American public, losses were staggeringly high. Archival action footage of torpedoed ships and sailors foundering in the sea remind us of the thousands of men who died in their perilous duty -- and explain why my own father recurrently awoke from nightmares for some thirty years afterward. Those interested in the subject of this video will also appreciate Humphrey Bogart's classic adventure film ""Action in the North Atlantic"" and Jan de Hartog's fictionalized novel about Convoy PQ-17, ""The Captain""."
4,Good fun kiddie rock,this album won't change your life but it rocks pretty good. it's nice to listen to this fluff every once in a while. It's cool
3,Good Record.,"i love mineral. i worship sunny day real estate. this record rips off those two artists and that's just the way it is. no more garbage about how different it is, because in reality, end of the ring wars is pretty run of the mill. that does not by any means make it bad or even less good. these guys play from the heart and they write awesome songs, so buy this record. good rock and roll, emotional, good lyrics, good instrumentation, good everything. however, mare vitalis, ring wars' successor, is infinitely better than this one. i would recommend starting with that, then listen to the equally wonderful low level owl records, then pick this up. it's a good first effort but i'm glad they grew up as fast as they did, because they would never have lasted."
3,It's Okay,The quality is okay. The pieces stay together but there are narrow gaps here and there. It's not as thick as the more expensive ones but why spend more on something that your child will eventually destroy? One awesome thing about these is that there were no strong chemical fumes when I opened the package. It's perfect for my two year old and she loves taking the letters out. I searched all over for a numbers set by the same manufacturer but did not find one; Hopefully I can find a different brand that will fit with this set.
3,Not as good as it looks,"My daughter loved to play with a similar product at her pre-school - and so I wanted to get her one for home. When this arrived, I was disappointed to find that the foam is very thin and flimsy. My recommendation...keep looking for something more durable!"
5,Reiki - Dr. Usui,This is an excellent book. I highly recommend it for my students and for other Reiki Practitioners.
1,Not much about Dr. Usui at all,"I don't know why this book is being promoted as being about ""The Legacy of Dr. Usui."" It's really just the author's random thoughts about modern Reiki culture, interspersed with Osho quotes and random thoughts about modern pop psychology. What does this have to do with Reiki? really, I wish I hadn't wasted the money. It also includes Dr. Usui 's horoscope and numerology character-analysis. What? I don't find that to be terribly useful. I want to know more real information about the man. This did not do that. Buy another book!"
1,First book that I ever returned to Amazon,"I thought that this book would similar to other books that I have purchased which use rhyming and mnemonic techniques to help kids remember new words and build their vocabulary. It doesn't. The cartoons are not memorable, and I was not happy with the purchase. This is the first and only book that I ever returned to Amazon for credit (less the return shipping cost)."
1,Just could not force myself to finish it,"I made it about a third of the way through this book before I put it down and never felt the desire to pick it up again.There was next to no romance in the story, and it read more like a high school history lesson than a novel meant to entertain. There were also so many characters and subplots woven together that I just could not keep everything straight. I realized later that this was the second book in a series, so maybe if I had read them in order than all the characters and their relationship to each other would have made more sense."
1,"A DIFFICULT, TEDIOUS READ",I AM A CANHAM FAN AND HAVE ENJOYED MANY OF HER BOOKS. THIS ONE WAS TERRIBLY DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW. HISTORY BUFFS MAY LIKE IT. I TOSSED IT AFTER 2-3 CHAPTERS...WHEN U NEED A CHEAT SHEET TO KEEP THE CHARACTERS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS STRAIGHT IT JUST ISN'T WORTH THE BOTHER.
5,Nimble Picks.,"I was recently introduced to jazz picks by a fellow guitarist and friend, and was impressed by the size and shape. Wanting my own, I ordered these little guys, and after getting them, I'm still impressed. The tiny size and thinness of the pick let me play arpeggios and other runs much easier than the normal-sized picks I've used ever since I picked up a guitar. I can be a fairly sloppy player at times, so by virtue of this pick's small size, I'm hitting less bum notes and fumbling around less than I do with normally-sized picks. I can't speak as to how this particular brand holds up against others, since these are my first jazz picks, but I can say that they feel very solid and are easy to grip, two important qualities for any pick. As of this writing, you can get a dozen of these bad boys for four dollars, so you really can't go wrong by giving them a shot."
4,motorboat engine rerair/service manual,"Fairly complete use manual, for the help in repairing, and servicing of certain years of mercury outboard motors, combined with links on enternet makes it complete."
3,Must Have Manual,This manual provides most of what you need to know for a shop manual. I have used it many times with expected results.
5,I love my T-connector,"It worked perfect, now I can use it with my new trailer hitch, and the price was just right, thank you"
5,New York City Teacher's Favorite Book,This book has done more to help my first and second graders learn to enjoy reading than all the books in my school put together! There isn't a week that goes by that someone doesn't beg me to read it to the class. Many of my students have actually gone out and bought their own copies (very rare for the neighborhood in which I teach). Every K-3 grader should have this book in his/her collection!
4,Great reading still,This series is definitely addictive. There are perhaps too many characters to follow easily but the chapters are developed so you can skim the characters / themes that do not hold interest. I am keen to keep reading!
1,A storm of swords,I have only just started this confusing slow book. I dont know if I will bother finishing it or any others in the series.
4,Many ends at not even the middle...,"Part II of book three is full of conclusions which is no bad thing. It feels likeep a reward finally having some conclusions to some pretty major story arcs. The only issue is the way that these story arcs seem to snuffed out in mid stride. I don't know if this is refreshing, in that the story arcs don't followed the same tired predictable routes, or if I feel robbed of my comfort zones, and more importantly robbed of some main characters I was just starting to feel connected to."
4,Great Little Movie,"if you don't mind a little fluff and not much of a story, this is a GREAT little easy to watch, fun movie with decent story line, good actors and lots of laughs. it really reflects good old surfing heydays and beach trivia.FUN FUN FUN ... wish it were on DVD but probably never will be unless it is no longer copyrighted. then hopefully some independent will get a good print and publish it. it really deserves to be seen."
2,California Dreaming '1979 movie.Saw it on Hulu.,"Good movie about some kid who arrives from Chicago,trying to fit into one California Beach town,who tries to learn how to surf and get girls. a good coming of age movie, but not one of the best, really cool beat up pontiac in the movie, and a Custom Corvette Solid Axle."

2,mildly entertaining,a little disappointed with the quality of the vhs tape- grainy with poor soundthe plot was pretty corny
4,Keep Giving Good Music,"This is a very nice and mellow CD. Very Relaxing, and excellent for music lovers who like listening to good music while driving.Will keep up with this artist"
4,Andre Ward has stepped up the plate with something tasteful,"Andre Ward has really stepped up to the plate and produced something as tasteful as his latest disc. Andre diligently mixes it up with some original compilations, but also provides his own unique and flavorful remakes of songs such as ""All I Ever Ask"", ""Steppin' In the Name of Love"", and ""Holding Back the Years"".I can honestly say that this young man, although he is not a new talent, is amongst one of the best hidden treasures in the world of smooth jazz. I would sincerely urge those of you looking for something different and unique to give this disc a try as I don't think that you will be disappointed."
3,Not that great.,I liked the whole story line and plot.I guess the reason why I didn't really love it was becasue of the diary format. If it wasn't written in that way I'd have probab;y got into it more and liked it more.
5,Still smiling...,"This book is a hoot. It took like two pages to start cracking me up and I was either giggling or smiling or laughing out loud the whole way through. Who knew sorority hazing could be such wicked fun? The author did, apparently, and now I do, too. Enjoy."
3,"Meh, Not worth it.","First, the pros: It works. It holds the jack handle to the jack standard. That's the primary purpose of this product, and it performs THAT job admirably.However (the cons): It's a big, tough, hunk of expensive molded plastic, and it doesn't have enough clearance for the bolt and nut of the clamp attachment at the top of the standard. Installing and removing the keeper with the attachment in place is tough to begin with; in below freezing weather, it's a real pain in the neck.If you don't have the clamp attachment installed, it will work great.I suppose one could cut off the parts that interfere with the clamp attachment's bolt, but I think I'd rather put a section of bicycle innertube around the handle, another around the standard, and cinch a $0.85 thumbscrew-style hose clamp around them to hold it all together."
2,Not compatable with the cover,"I placed this holder on the High-Lift, and then tried to put the asembly into the cover. It doesn't fit. I feared that If I forced it, I would damage the cover. This is a either/or assembly. DON'T try to use both."
5,"Hi lift acc,",A must have to keep from getting your fingers pinched. It works great to keep the handle secure on any hi-lift jack.
1,Hi-Lift jack handle keeper.,This is not worth the money you pay for it. Bought it an was only on the Jeep for 4 months before it broke in half and the one half got lost on the trail. Only saw it when we got back home and found the one half stuck in the jack.Will try and see if they will cover it under warrantee but are not very hopeful about it.
4,VG Product.,It is much better than the bungee cord I was using before buying this product. I wonder if it will get lost bouncing down some desert 4-wheel drive trail.
2,Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior,Mr. Sinclaire needs a spell checker for his Japanese terms and names. There are too many mistakes for typos. The history is based on popular Japanese Movie Themes. The book has excellent pictures and graphics. Could have been a good reference book but with all the spelling errors this book will create more misinformed.
4,a nice gift,I gave this as a gift. It covers all different parts of samurai history and costume. It does spend a lot of time on weapons whereas I bought it mainly for the costume part of it.
5,Lightning strikes again!,"On ""Aurora"", Jose Luis Encinas does it again! He has created musical magic through a spectrum of sounds and styles. His Spanish guitar takes the listener on a journey through an array of beautiful melodies which have that zest for life. Very worth- while listening! His song ""Buscame"" is featured with vocals by a Spanish singer, Mari Carmen Segura, and on the acoustic version of the song. ""Huracan Rumba"" is a sure-fire winner with it's lively guitar and percussive rhythm, ""Aurora en Llamas"" is romantic and reflective, ""Dos Noches en Granada"" evokes passion and romance, ""Isla Mujeres"" incorporates wonderful, Latin vibes and rhythms; ""Cazador de Hielo"" is flavorful, Spanish guitar with a Western- style appeal, while ""Cortina de Niebla"" has a very soothing quality and a harmonious melody that speaks to the heart. Overall, it's an incredibly energetic CD with an abundance of radiant talent. Listen to it and let it carry you away to romantic Spain!!! I love this CD!"
4,"""Time is nature's way of keeping everything from happening at once.""","Co-producer Stephen King and his daughter Tabitha are contributing writers to this thirteen chapter TV series about a spook-infested hospital that was built on the ruins of a mill fire disaster. KINGDOM HOSPITAL's great cast elevates a creepy ghost story that fails only in a final recap-driven, pull-it-all-together episode. Otherwise, it's a fine way to lose youself for many hours in the suprernatural, the comic and the tragic.Recommended to all!Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.5) Kingdom Hospital (TV-2004) - Jamie Harrold/Andrew McCarthy/Bruce Davison/Diane Ladd/Ed Begley Jr./Benjamin Ratner/Alan Scarfe/Antony Holland/Michael Lerner"
5,classic King overtones,"Good series from Steven King, just wish they would have made more then just one season. If you like Kings style of horror and humor this is a good dvd to get."
1,Good Information-Poor Format,This software was not state-specific and had too many disclaimers to allow for any confidence factor in the use of it. I would return it for a money-back guarantee if I could. The information makes the establishment of a living trust much more complicated than the process really is. I now have to purchase another software product to accomplish what I thought this one would do.
3,Shooters Rear Bag Overfilled With Sand,"The item was normal in shipping time, the only problem is that it is over filled with sand, not allowing the bag to open up to hold the rifle stock. It had been sewn shut, after taking sand out it works as it should. Now the fill opening leaks sand, I needs to be resewn, I will have to pay someone to do it since it is leather.Shooters Ridge Leather Rear Pre-Filled Sand Bag"
1,No me gustó,"tiene hojas que parecen para jugar, nada sirve para hacer verdadero scrapbooking. Se lo dí a mi hija para ""pintar"""
5,great hammer but be careful ordering it on amazon,"This is a great hammer...comfortable grip....shock absorbing action is good. However when I ordered the smooth face version on amazon they sent me the waffle face. I was able to return it and they said they would send the right one. I got another waffle face. They finally admitted it wasn't in stock and didn't know when the right one would be in. I was able to return it again and everything was credited, but what a hassle. I was able to find the hammer locally. So I love the hammer, but it's hard to say whether you'll get the one you ordered."
1,"Interesting, but not as E-Z as WriteExpress Easy Letters","This software leveraged the E-Z name but it doesn't come close to WriteExpress Easy Letters which has ""2,000 prewritten letters, tips, step-by-step instructions on 500 writing topics, also samples sentences and phrases for each writing step"". It also integrates directly into Microsoft Word which was a real time-saver for me. Someone tell E-Z to rebrand or buy Easy Letters."
2,Not So Business Like,"I was somewhat disappointed with the sample letters. The style seems to be more appropriate for personal letters rather than letters used in business. The concept is good, but my business associates would find the suggested text laughable. Ok for home use, but not for corporate."
5,Struttin' Your Stuff....!!,"Highly Dancable and look out,when the Billie Merrin Orchestra begins to play,""Rhythem of the Rumba""You will be Struttin' Your Stuff, guaranteed."
1,Look further,"Judge Pollak vacated and superseded the January 2002 opinion cited by another reviewer. Two U.S. Courts of Appeals have since held fingerprint evidence admissible. U. S. v. Mitchell, 365 F.3d 215 (3d Cir. 3004) and U.S. v. Crisp, 324 F.3d 261 (4th Cir. 2003). The Mitchell court rejected Cole's view that fingerprint evidence is not admissible under U.S. Supreme Court criteria for the admission of scientific opinion evidence."
1,the great van morrison,the great van morrisonth e condition was goodthe content was very poor and disappointingI will try another van morrison greatest hits
1,"These are half-cases, with only 5 reams per box.",I was disappointed when the order was delivered and the two cases that I had ordered were actually a total of 10 reams of paper in two boxes. I went back to review the online listing and could not find in the Product Description where it indicated the number of reams per box.
3,Universal 500 sheet plain copy paper,"Quality is fine, but the price came out to a little over $4 a ream, which is okay, but better deals can be found."
3,Only 2500 sheets.,I was under the assumption for some reason that this was a 5000-page box. It's not. It's only 2500. I should've ordered the HP brand 2500 pack for $12 less...
5,Sleek slides,"These slides are really very pretty and versatile. I got the black ones and they go with every outfit b/c they have just the right amount of sparkle to them. I can dress up my jeans with them or even wear them for a presentation with a dress skirt. They are comfortable, however they did hurt when I wore them for the first time, but only after wearing them for 5hrs straight, and I was on my feet the whole time. I bought a size 7, but I think a 7.5 may have been better. In any event, I think this is a great buy especially for the price! Get them ladies, you won't be disappointed!"
3,What can you say about a pen refill?,"I have not had to put this in my Lamy pen yet, so I cannot comment on whether this particular refill meets my expectations. I will say that I really love my Lamy pen, and if this refill works like the one it will eventually replace, I will be fully satisfied."
3,wrong fitting,however they refound me fully for the return and I was able to get the right fitting rails for the crib.
2,Lyla88,"I was very excited to play even though I received it a few days late.. Looks very nice but doesn't stay tuned for longer than 30, 45 min. Head phones are garbage!!!"
2,GOOD AT FIRST BUT NOT LATER!!,it was my first electric voilin and it seemed like the best and it was like that for about a year. but then it started to not work anymore. I WOULD NOT SUGEST BUYING IT !! unless you are only to play it for a year or 2 but after that it just doesn't work as well. I TAKE CARE OF MY STUFF TO EXPECUALLY MY VIOLINS!!BUT ITS GREAT FOR BEGINNERS TO START ON BUT Ii suggest a diffrent one if you want to have it long term.
5,Hear that Lonesome Whistle Blow,I ordered this book for a class I am taking in college. I received the book on time and it came in wonderful condition!
4,So you thought pop up books were just for kids..,"If you thought that there could be nothing NEW done with F1 information and photos think again !Pop-up books just came to the adult auto racing enthusiasts area...If you love F1 and all the information A-Z that goes with it, AND you happen to like paper models and a fresh approach to applying them, then you'll just love this book...you have to see it to believe it. I'm sure it will become collectable in time. IMOPlus a sound CD that contains F1 sounds from 1951 to 1999And don't forget the 3-D glasses (included) and all the pages to use them on !"
1,does not fit a Scion TC cars,the seat cover look very nice ...but it did not fit into my Scion TC car seats.
4,"Good product, worth the money.","The item helped us pack for a week long vacation without battles for space. I had no problems fitting clothes into it or getting the air out of it. I would be gentle though when closing and opening the bag so you don't tear it because it seems thin at the connections. Also, make sure to use your hands like on a ziploc bag to close it even after sliding the plastic piece because that thing never closed it all the way."
3,"Not bad, but you have to take it with a grain of salt","This book is full of good in formation, but some of her conclussion about Frigg and Freyja in particular are a little strange. The Celtic in formation in the book is solid, as in most of the other information. She did however leave out a chapter on the Goddesses of war, and the women warroirs, but over all it's not a bad place to start, take it witha grain of salt."
4,US Navy ships,I good reference source for early navy ships of the US Navy. As a shelf book i prize it highly I am familar with Paul Silvertstone for the naval Photos obtained from him in earlier years.
3,quality of purchase,"Ordered the game with the title ""just like new"", but it came scratched. We had to have it professionally cleaned. It works, but it still skips."
2,Ultimate Flop,"If you've been asleep the last ten years of gaming, this one will be exciting ... If you've played any modern games, this one is a horrible step back, nothing about this game is even enjoyable, honestly, and I only paid like [...] bucks for it, lol. Buy a cheeseburger instead."
4,Quite fun...4.5 stars,"I'll be the first to admit it, I'm not a video game guy. I buy one or two games per year, and the last one I bought was Spider-Man 2, which I played like crazy. I loved that game. When I heard about Ultimate Spider-Man, and that it was going to have the same structure as SM2, I knew that it would be my gaming purchase of the season.I definitely did not waste my money. If you enjoyed Spider-Man 2, chances are you're going to enjoy this game as well.So far, I am very happy with this game. It will give me many hours of enjoyment. Still, there are elements of the game that could have been improved. The radar/map that was present in SM2 is still intact, but is much harder to see in this incarnation. Swinging through trees is disorientating as well. These are minor gripes, and once I got used to them, the game is just as good as SM2. Currently I am stuck trying to chase Electro as Venom, a task that is proving much harder than any of the Black Cat chases in the previous game."
4,Black and Blond,"This book was about Rich Gaskins moving to a new town called Marchmont, and finding out about the town's racial problems when he joins the marchmont basketball team, which is made up of mostly blacks. The team plays poorly because the blacks dislike Rich. The rest of the book is about how Rich can make his team become better.I thought this book was good. If I were to rate it from 1-10, I would give it an 8 because I enjoyed the book in some parts, but other parts were boring. I also thought the author did a very good job of combining racial problems with basketball, because if it didn't have the basketball part, I wouldn't have liked this book that much. I also thought that this book could have had a better ending. I think the author should make a sequel to this book, so readers could find out what happens to all the characters after high school."
4,"Great product, not-so-great-sizing information","It's shorts weather here at least nine months of the year, and these pants are great for The Kid's school uniform. They're the right color, they're durable, and I only had to buy five of these vs. five each of shorts and pants. It would be great if the sizing was more standardized to kids clothing for older kids."
4,"Was a great deal for me, but I did NOT get product as listed","I'm giving this a high rating because of the great price I paid relative to the product I got, but when you put your money down, don't expect to get the product listed above shipped to you.I was expecting to get a controller that would let me ""win saber locks with lightsaber button"" and have wireless ""Auto-connect technology allows up to 16 players to play without interference [...] play up to 30 feet from console"" as advertised above.Instead I got a wired controller with the same cable length as the default. The rumble feedback is stronger than default controllers, and the internal lighting is a nice touch, but it isn't wireless at all and I can't find the saber button mentioned.Hopefully the turbo and programming functions will work as described in the manual...I'll have to try those next."
4,Classic Sinatra at a Great Price!,"The reason I gave this 3 CD Set 4 stars instead of 5? These recordingswere made before 'Stereo' came along. But, the engineers did a great jobof transfering (Re-mastering?) the songs to CD, and they sound very good.Seventy-five classics by the greatest crooner of the 20th century.Interested in 'Sinatra in Stereo'? You might also buy ""The RepriseCollection""-- it's ALL in stereo. Buy both-- you'll be glad you did."
2,Good Sounding but a Major DEFECT!!,There is a major Defect on CD # 3.Track 1 and track 2 are reversed.The manufacturer and Amazon do not care to do anythingabout this.Sound quality is otherwise very good.All sets are like thisso beware.
3,Get the individual CDs instead,"As an owner of probably a dozen Sinatra CDs, including this collection, let me offer a different perspective than the others. If you are new to Sinatra or introducing someone to it, I'd recommend getting the Best of the Capitol Years (the 1 CD best of). If you like that one, then start picking up the individual CDs from his Capitol Years-- Songs for Swingin' Lovers, In the Wee Small Hours, Nice-n-Easy, etc. The individual collections are thematic and the music is more enjoyable heard as part of the whole (as originally intended)."
5,simply the best,"This CD has something for every mood, from High Hopes to One for my Baby. I am always amazed at the new things I hear each time I play Sinatra: it's good to know that I'm still growing and maturing and I tend to realize it more in Frank's company than at any other time. This is the sort of CD you can just leave on continuously; hit the random button and just let that voice fill all the corners of your home. You'll find yourself singing along to songs you don't really know (but are so familiar that they are like involuntary muscle movement - you don't think, the words just come to you, and out of you.)"
3,Strange Brew,"It's good, but strange. It's hard to get a whole lot out of one instrument, althought Roger does. I'd recomend it for strange nights."
3,Gift,I cannot review this product as it was a gift to my grandson. He seems to have no problems with it.
4,Pilots: find a copy of this book and give it to your child!,"Years after getting my pilot's license a friend commented in passing, ""You know, I have no idea whatsoever how a plane flies, yet I get on one every week."" My impromptu 5-minute explanation of the principles of flight returned a blank stare.I dug this simple book, given to me when I was six, out of a box in my closet to discover that Robin Lawrie had done a superb job of explaining and illustrating it all. I'm now looking for another copy for my six-year-old cousin.Christopher Sowada"
1,cgfns review,"medical surgical, Psychiatric, pediatric, ob-gyne,maternal child,orthopedic, ICU, ICCU,EENT and others"
3,Cudos For Glover,A fascinating look into the lengths Nazi Germany tried to go in order to gain information. John Glover is superb in his role as Nazi German Psychologist/Torturer as he tries to convince Corben Bernsen's character that the war is over and to pull whatever information he can out of him.
4,better than expected,great instruction and cool features where you can loop the diagrams. If you love manchester united even better.my only negatives keeping from five stars.--wish the goaltending section was better
5,U7 soccer coach,WOW!!! Here's how to take your kids (and yourself) to the next level for skills development. No more poorly constructed videos or diagrams - these are very professionally produced so that you understand every move. There's also good dialogue with the pros and trainers about how to really finesse these moves on the pitch.
4,Great but...,"This is a great product---I was really impressed with the ease with which one could customise it. The templates were superb. I was able to create a business site in an evening. The only downside to the product is that you are FORCED to host your site with the owners of the product. I had a website before I bought the product, and I wasn't ready to have two different websites. If you don't have a business site and you are ready to host your site with the owner of the program, this is probably the best product there is. However, if you are trying to upgrade an existing site with ecommerce capabilities, this might not be suitable for you--unless of course you are ready to pay for two sites at the same time."
3,eMerchantPro has terrible customer service,"I've used eMerchantPro for about 18 months. The product is simple to use and quickly produces a professional looking website. The shopping cart works really well. The inventory and order notification works great. I have been pretty satisfied. However, THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL!!! If you have a technical problem or a question- you are on your own. They don't reply to emails and you will sit on hold until you give up. Don't try to copy any strange graphics or links (eg hit counters, links to Amazon, etc) into one of your webpages or it will lock up everything and you won't be able to edit your pages."
1,Wasted time & money,"It is supposed to be easy, they say. I read the other reviews here and they make it sound pretty simple (even though they sounded a lot like marketing brochures), so I make the jump... and end up knee-deep in a mess. First off, I want to keep using my netscape browser: NO, I am told, you must use ONLY the Microsoft browser. next, I want to use my new imac I got from the kids: NO, I am told, you must use ONLY a windows computer. So fine, I install microsfot's internet explorer on my windows computer... 14 hours later, I am STILL trying to figure out how this product even works! Enough is enough, back in the box it goes."
2,Not bad for the price,"If you can buy this camera at a reasonable price then be happy and enjoy the camera. It's really not that bad as far as quality and especially if the price is under ($). A better ""Bang for the Buck"" is the Largan Digital Camera. For about ($) more you'll have about double the quality, better software and a full warranty."
1,"""NO RING TO THIS""","GOLDEN EARRING HAVE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND HAVE A REMARKABLE CAREER...""BUT"" I QUESTION THE RELEASE OF THIS BOX SET?? THIS COMPILATION MISSES THE MARK WITH A MIXED BAG OF HITS AND MISSES.THE SO CALLED RARE TRACKS RELEASED ON THIS SET ARE THROW AWAY STUDIO TUNES THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE RESURFACED.WE ""THE FANS"" DESERVED A BETTER BOX SET THAN THIS.GOLDEN EARRING MADE TOO MANY EXCELENT RECORDINGS AND THIS C D HISTORY DOES NOT REFLECT THAT!!!!"
4,follows on the heels of Learning Perl,"'Perl Objects, References, and Modules' follows hard on the heels of 'Learning Perl'. If you liked LP, you will like PORM, which follows the practical and concise style of LP.The writers left a lot out of LP, simply because of the amount of material would make a good, short book a bad, long one. References, data structures, and modules are one of the great strengths of Perl, but LP just doesn't get to those subjects. PORM does, and it covers them the same way, i.e., in a narrow, targeted fashion. PORM is a necessary stepping stone for the developing Perl student.The only downside of the book is that it lacks a theoretical discussion of how references work, but that kind of discussion would probably detract."
1,Not recommendable at all...,"""Perl Objects, References & Modules"" written by Randal L. Schwartz is an overpriced, botched work that does not meet the quality of the first well-known ""llama"" book.Just 220 pages for such complex topics like OOP are simply too less allowing novice programmers to get familiar with. Many provided examples are highly complicated and lacking of good explanation.Sure, this book discusses advanced topics of Perl and therefore is also dedicated to the more experienced user, but it still is a book for people wanting to learn this great programming language - unfortunately they face a hard time when trying to do so.Well, Mr. Schwartz stated at the preface of this book that it was mainly written in a bar (with some beer, I guess). And yes, it reads like that..."
5,Important Note - Discontinued,"New editions of this book are no longer in the works, as this title is being discontinued. O'Reilly's ""Intermediate Perl"" by the same authors (Randal L. Schwartz, brian d foy, and Tom Phoenix) is the new edition of this book. The first edition of ""Intermediate Perl"" was released March 2006. So if you're thinking about purchasing this book, purchase ""Intermediate Perl"" instead. It includes the same material (albeit updated) by the same authors. Once again, this title has been discontinued."
1,"Worked well for a bit, but broke to easily","I thought when buying this stretch cord the the thing would actually be able to stretch. The cord broke within one of my first few uses. Now granted at 6'3"" I am a little bit taller than the average person, but I would think that the cord would still be able to take a little bit of a longer stretching. I certainly won't be purchasing any more of this item."
1,Scratchiest sheets,"These sheets are so uncomfortable, I cannot believe they are 1200 thread count. The worst sheets I have ever slept on, don't waste your money."
1,it sucks,"This is the second hookless shower curtain I bought, after having the first one for almost three years, and this one didn't last three months. The part that hooks on the curtain rod got all wambly and all but fell completely off altogether. In fact, this curtain made me go back to hooks, which I never thought I'd do."
2,Color not as depicted,"I guess this is what that customer added picture was trying to get at. First of all, the background is clear, not white. Secondly, the colors are not as they appear in the picture, they are dark, more primary color shades, red-red, dark blue, kelly green, etc. Not the sort of muted colors in the picture. Item is going back."
5,Suprised,I never used hookless curtain before but it is so much better than the usual curtains. It is very easy to put it on and it is very stable. The colors are really nice also. I put a regular white curtain along with this one and the colors look even better. I would recommend this to everyone.
4,good design,"The ""hookless"" design is really interesting. It took me only 10 seconds to install the curtain and then curtain work very well.But it is not white as the photo suggests. It is translucent."
3,Not Bad,"I tried several different type of litter mat, sadly that I have not yet found the perfect one. Comparing with others this one is not bad."
1,PC Copy Protection.,"If you plan on buying this CD and putting it on you iPod, forget it!!! Beware when you purchase this CD as it has copy protection on it to keep you from playing it on computers. (Bad for us that what to put it on our iPods!!!)Tried to play the CD on my computers at home (Dell XPS 4th Gen, Dell XPS 400 and HP Pavilion laptop) and none of them would play the CD. The computer at work (don't know what model but it's a Dell with WIN 2000 Pro) and it won't play the first track but would play the rest of the CD. It look like the copy protection is only good on newer computers/software."
3,Only buy if you have a CD stereo,"Unfortunately, as others have said, there is a weird protection on the disc that will only allow it to be played on cd stereos (cars, boomboxes, walkmans, etc)... it will not let you burn this to your pc (which is unfortunate as it has some of the greatest songs from a few years back on this)...If it was able to be transferred to my ipod, or just to be pc in general it would get a 5 star rating hands down... unfortunately, as I have yet to figure out how to get around the protection layer, a three is all I can give."
5,Sick Sick Sick Sick !!!!!,all i have to say is SICK!!!!!!! oh my God GOT THE CD this morning cant stop palying it wow!! great jobnote I can play it on my DELL no problem (laptop) and now on my IPOD
1,Avoid,This New CD format cannot be played on a PC. Thanks for not telling me ahead of time so I could have avoided making the purchase.Now I have a colorful coaster which cost me $14.:-( Big thumbs down.
2,Luxurious sand paper?,"These sheets are not worth the price. They feel like the rough cloth you would find in a jiu-jitsu gi. There is a reason that these sheets were reduced in price so much, and that is because they are not luxurious sheets. I highly recommend that you purchase some different sheets instead."
3,royal Heritage,"The quality of the sheets were great fitted sheet was a great fit but the flat sheet the length and the width wereto short, pillow cases to narrow. Eileen"
2,Sheets piled up,"The sheets were gorgeous when I received them. Nice and thick, oversized. Now after washing them twice they are piling up. Very aggravating. 80.00 is a decent price for these sheets but I have paid 60.00 and not had them pile."
4,Pretty nice sheets,"They are very comfortable, but yes they do wrinkle. Not terribly, but they do wrinkle even when removed immediately from the dryer."
3,"Feel Great, Smell Horrible Until Washed",Just got these in. So far the material feels very soft and they seem to be constructed well. The one thing I am trying to rectify however is the smell. I received three sets and all three have this oily chemical smell. I have washed them once with cold water and it didn't help. I'm trying a second wash now on a more rugged wash cycle. If that doesn't help I will try using warm water as the instructions call for. Hopefully this will help and I can edit my review to a higher setting.EDIT: After washing a few times all of the smell is now gone. The system won't let me change the star rating but I would now give it a Four. Still deducting one because it took a few washings before they finally smelled ok.
1,"Very True, Shrinking is horrible problem","I purchased these wonderful sheets, only to have them after the second washing not fit on our mattress. Yes, they are wonderfully soft and lovely to sleep on, but we can only use them on a regular size mattress."
3,"good value, but not high quality","for $40 they are useable sheets, but if you are expecting luxury, think again."
2,sheet set,"The sheet sets were nice, however it states it will fit a mattress us to 17 or 18"" deep, which was wonderful as we just purchased a 16"" thick, and it didn't fit! The return was easy and prompt credit."
3,More blue than green,"More help on the color ""willow"". Once they arrived I saw they were exactly the color you see on your computer - a very faint bluey-green. Not quite the light green ""willow"" I was expecting from the last review, but good enough I guess.Three stars because of how soft they aren't after two washings, especially compared to our Egyptian cotton sheets they replaced, but I think these will be highly durable (the last ones wore through pretty quickly)."
3,These sheets shrink,"They do shrink over time, no matter how you wash them. Bought mine in April, its now December and you must struggle to make them fit my queen size bed. For the price, they are heavy but I'd caution you they are not long lasting."
2,"Ok, but not great","We just got our sheets tonight, washed them in cold water and put them on the bed... Problem though is that they are a little small. They don't fit the bed correctly and we've got a standard matress. SO even though the sheets feel soft and all I'm sure we'll spend each morning putting the sheets over the matress because they ""popped off"" again... Not something I would buy again."
2,sheet set,"the sheets are super soft, which i love. however, there is fading along some of the fold lines. i suspect these were on display in a store and faded in the sunlight. thought about returning them, but wasn't worth the hassle given the price i paid. the faded area is covered by the comforter anyway."
1,"Great out of package, but changes when washed/dried","Great deal for 1000 ct sheets ($39.99), so I bought... very silky outside of the package, although the color was faded to pink in the corners, as if it had sat out in the sun too long. I got a small refund back for that as I liked the feel of them.Anyway, after 2 washes, I can see the smooth sateen sheen starting to wash away (guess the fact that the sheen was on one side of the sheets was a clue), and they've shrunken considerably despite only drying on warm setting. They are thick, and were cheap, but don't hold up like luxury sheets."
1,The worst waist of Money,"These sheets should be given away. Amazon was great about giving me a new set when I thought mine were deffective, because they start to fall apart after a week, but my new set is doing the same thing. DO NOT buy these."
2,Disappointed,There is no way these sheets are a 1000 thread count. They are cheap and not worth the money. All in all they will last though and I dont imagine the stitching coming out or anything like that but it is just not what was described.
4,Nice sheets,"Very good quality sheets, the fitted sheet has elastic all the way around. They did feel smoother prior to being washed, but they are still nice."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought these sheets on sale for $39.99. First of all these sheets were extremely soft and comfortable. When I first put them on my bed they were a little too big. However, when I washed them (following the manuf. instructions), the sheets shrank so much, I could not even stretch the fitted sheet, no matter how hard I pulled and tugged, to fit my mattress. I am not sure if I just received a defective set of sheets, or if this is a common occrurence."
3,"they feel great, but...","This is the shortest top sheet I have ever seen! If you have an extra thick mattress, be aware that the top sheet may be too short. I like to fold down the top sheet a few inches over the blanket, but there just isn't enough length in the sheet to do this. We ended up having to untuck the sheet from under the bottom of the mattress just so that we could pull up the covers high enough when we sleep. I haven't exactly rushed to put these sheets back on the bed."
4,Wonderful!,Very soft and comfortable to sleep on. My only complaint would be that the flat sheet is not long enough to tuck into the foot of the bed if you have a pillowtop mattress.
2,Great sheets for short period of time...,These sheets were the softest sheets I've ever slept in... until after a few washings the fitted sheet became pilled. I'd prefer a regular sheet to these now. I don't recommend buying them unless you only need them for a month or two... and that would be odd.
3,I've heard they're great... but,"can't wait to receive them, but now they're saying it will take almost four months to have them shipped to me. Anyone else have that problem?"
2,"Royal Heritage Home 1000-Thread Count 100% Cotton Sateen, Queen Sheet Set, Lilac","Rough and thick, even after many washings and use. Not happy at all. My 300 ct. is still hands down (though a different brand). Will not buy again."
5,Excellent Sheets,"I think we paid $60 or less, maybe $40. For those prices, these sheets are excellent. They are extremely soft and have a nice weight to them, not thin like most sub-400 count sheets."
1,nice feel...for short time,Great sheets ... until you laundry them for couple of times (by following instructions!)- the fabric develops tangles and flocks like a cheap cotton. Tried to find them on internet w/o any luck.Stay away. This cheap price is for the reason.
1,Do not buy,"THIS IS NOT ""ROYAL HERITAGE HOME BRAND"" THIS SET IS VERY THIN AND NOT EVEN WORTH THE DISCOUNTED PRICE. BEWARE OF ANYONE ON AMAZON SELLING SHEETS THAT CLAIM TO BE ROYAL HERITAGE HOME."
2,not so great,ok Im a bit of a sheet/bedding freak.I grew up on high quality sheets and was happy when I came to a point in my life to be able to purchase quality sheets(in college I couldnt validate spending $$ on sheets so had like 2 sets my mom bought me-lol)anyway these are heavy which is good but to think these are originally sell for $400 is crazy-i bought them at $50 and feel I paid too much-I have spent far less and far more for sheets and honestly the best sheets I ever bought were $45 ones a few months here on amazon and will stick with those-they are killer soft and better made than these-these concerned me from the second i got them-threads everywhere and pillowcases were unevenly sewn.I would not suggest people waste their money on these honestly.
2,Billys...,"worst album. Enough is Enough is better my opinion. Best songs on this cd are: she goes down, conscience point, facts of life. But I believe it is out of print. Try and find Tale of the Tape. That is his best."
3,a solid cd with good newschool Freestylesongs but...,"...not too much to get excited about, sure there are some good tracks and rare tracks like Willie Crespo, Original DTU and Legacy, But Kool Chris mixxing is no fun, He doesnt put accapellas on other beats. he just mix the song straight up and down like it was just off the turntables. Listen to Tim Spinnin Schommer's cd instead, his mixx is much more creative."
1,possible worst launch ever.,"dial-up users do not bother. in the slim chance you happen to make it past the web logon get ready for a LONG wait to get into char creation. oh theres a good chance youll get booted on the way there as well and a sure thing youll get booted when actually entering the game. zoning, entering the game, etc. all take forever on a dial-up and again usually kick you. woohoo"
1,Billing issues,"I have tried for days to create an account and all I get is this rather generic message:----An error occurred processing your billing information. For detailed information on this error, please send an email to horizons@ibill.com. Your email will be answered within 24 hours or less.It is important that you contact customer service before you attempt to make a payment again. Repeated attempts to submit this credit card may result in a temporary freeze of funds on your account.----Doesn't really explain anything, does it? I tried contacting their billing support but only got an automated response. So far nothing has worked. Even tried different credit cards but got the same message.I really can't rate it higher than one if I can't even manage to get in.They obviously have organization issues. I suggest all looking into buying this game hold out for at least a few months while they resolve their problems."
1,Missing Major Features,"This game has possibly ruined the entire MMORPG genre for me. I personally didn't have any problems with the launch as some seem to have had - my problem is with the game itself. There simply is less innovation in this game than the first generation MMORPGs. If you plan to play an adventure school then get ready for kill monster X for experience (there are no item drops - only crafting resources), level up, and then move on to killing monster Y ad infinitum. If you plan on playing a crafter, just substitute create item in place of kill monster. Nothing fun about this game at all."
4,Great game but don't buy used!,"While still working out some gltiches, the overall experiance is great with a fabulous user-based commerce and a lot of fun in the adventuring areas as well.The glitches are not all worked out but one would assume subsequent released would fix this.A note: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME USED. The Cd-Keys and accounts are NOT transferrable and establishing your own account will not be possible with Artifact Entertainment if the game has already been registered. Artifact will NOT transfer the code or account. I've already had to purchase a second copy of the game after a used version was untransferrable. Customer support was very helpful and polite but unable due to user agreements to assist on that one."
1,"Unless you have a credit card, DO NOT BUY!!!","A user posted that as far as he is concerned, it is still in the beta stage...That is giving it far too much credit!!I bought the game because a mmorpg guild I belong to uses this as their main game of play. Was I ever wrong to join them this time. I installed the game fine, I went through most of the sign up fine until I had gotten to BILLING...WTF!! My box states I have a free month included...Yeah?!? Where is it??I live in Canada so it makes it that much worse in trying to play this game, their support website is the absolute worse because in order to get help, you need to sign up your account but in order to sign up your account you need to get past billing...WTF, WTF, WTF!!This game would be worth it if you had a credit card but everyone else can spend their money on a far better company...Blizzard, Microsoft, Strategy First, GoD games....anyone who doesn't charge you to buy and charge you to play...Stay away!!"
4,My early review is good.,Not sure about the people having the game issues. I ve never experienced any Lag or problems logging on at all. Currently have a lvl 14 Dragon and have found the game fun to play as there are lots of things to discover in the early stages. Graphics are nice but in my opinion not as good as say SWG. In fact some of the Armor i see on others isnt even as detailed as Old Everquest which has been around forever it seems. The game has a nice feel though and would recommend it to someone that might be tiring of EQ or other mmorpg
2,I've read some of these reviews,"The graphics aren't so hot, the game is fairly boring. I have to question the people writing these reviews. I got a totally different impression playing the beta."
3,Getting better,"I've played this game on and off for a while now, and I can say that it is getting better. Most of the issues past reviewers have complained about have been fixed, and content is being added each month. This game is now almost where it should have been at release:P. 1 more year in development would have been better than an early (very bugged) release, but it has been getting better."
1,very confusing and complicated account creation,"After you shell out a couple of dozen bucks on CD, you need to pay additional dozen bucks a month to keep online account. Horizons account creation is absolutely the worst I have ever experienced (and I played quite a few games online).It requires patches that themselves require administrator privileges. After installation, launching the account gave me a puzzling message that the game is not installed. If you ever felt the worst features that Microsoft has - big, complex, buggy - that is the feeling that Horizons leaves.Extremely disappointed.."
1,Wasted Potential,"I feel bad that so many talented people worked so hard on this disappointing game.I started my account day of launch and played it for 2 months. I was intending to write a very detailed, scathing review...but I find I no longer have the energy or desire to devote my attention to it.I'm fairly certain no one is considering this game unless theyre already familliar with MMORPG's, so let me be as brief as possible:Dont even bother with this game! It was released months too soon. It's buggy and laggy beyond belief. It's underdeveloped and woefully short of content. It's poorly balanced with few worthwhile playable classes. It loads from a slow-moving website (load times can take 5-10 minutes depending upon your system and connection). And lastly, aside from playable dragons (which arent all that great), it offers nothing new to the genre.Play Dark Age of Camelot, Play EQ, or wait for World of Warcraft or EQ2. This game deserves a quiet, merciful death."
1,Unfortunately didn't work on my water spots,"I had high hopes that this product would remove the water spots that were on my car. Unfortunately it seems to of done very little, if anything to remove the water spots. In fairness I am not sure the duration the spots were on the car so there could of been minor etching into the clearcoat. This product may work well if the spots are light in mineral deposits or not been on for very long but if they have been there for awhile or have higher concentrations you will need to look elsewhere. I was able to use adam's polishing system to remove mine."
5,Better than expected,"My parking space is right next to a lawn sprinkler that uses extremely hard well water. My shiny new black VW end up coated with gritty white mineral spots that were very difficult to remove. When the Duragloss Water Spot Remover arrived it was hot and sunny (Naples Florida) but I was so disgusted with the spots that I started spraying the product on the hot car. The car was so hot that steam would arise from the surface after spraying. In spite of the heat, the spots disappeared and the car looked much better but there was some noticeable smearing of the underlying wax. A few days later we had a rainstorm and the next morning the car looked great, no more smears and nice and shiny. The sprinkler has since been adjusted but I still have some Duragloss remaining, just in case..."
1,Product does not work!,Save your money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I tested it on two different cars with water spots. It did not do anything. I was able to remove the water spots with meguiars cleaner-wax.
1,NOT ZERUEL,The character depicted is NOT zeruel from the Neon Genesis Evangelion series. Cool looking figure but I sure wish it was actually the figure they said it would be.
5,Barbra the Diva,I was thrilled to receive the boxed set of Barbra Streisand movies. They are some of my favourites and have added a new dimension to my DVD collection. If you are a Streisand fan this is the set for you
4,Love it!,"Perfect!!! I received my Barbra Streisand Collection very fast (within about three days). It is obviously a boxed set but when you open the beautiful tin, Funny Girl is packaged separately... New; pefect condition. No issues with this product/seller :-)"
1,"Wait, what???","Someone commented that the price is low for 4 DVDs in a collector's tin. I don't know how much anyone values tins, but I would personally only value the box my movies come in at $25 at the most, unless it is made out of pure gold. Since the price point is $225, this leaves $50 per movie. I don't know if it is just the inadequate product description (as others have pointed out), and I am somehow missing the value here, but this product seems like a huge waste of money to me. I'd advise getting instead the collection that is exactly the same except without Funny Girl or the tin and save yourself $200. Then you can pick up a brand new copy of Funny Girl on its own for $10 AND you will know exactly what version of the movies you are getting."
1,What IS this?,"I agree with the previous writers. How can I buy this when I don't know what it contains? A ""tin"" in and of itself doesn't mean a thing to me. What's on the discs? It is one disc or four? Are there any extras? What version are we getting? Come on Amazon; come clean with this item. What IS it?"
1,Special collector's edition?,"Supposedly this is the special collector's edition tin box of ""The Way We Were,"" ""Prince of Tides,"" ""The Mirror Has Two Faces,"" and ""Funny Girl."""
5,Josie and the Pussycats Guitar/Vocal/Chords Tablature Book,"This is a must have Guitar Tablature book for those whom would like to learn how to play the music from the movie ""Josie and the Pussycats"", starring Rachael Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson, & Tara Reid. This is the sheet music for the (RIAA) Certified Gold selling Soundtrack to the movie based on the Hanna Barbera Cartoon.Songs included are:3 Small WordsPretend to be NiceSpin AroundYou Don't See MeYou're a StarShapeshifterI Wish You WellReal Wild ChildCome OnMoneyDujour Around the WorldBackdoor LoverJosie and the Pussycats"
3,Borrow it from a library first,"This book is required for a grant-writing class I'm taking this semester. The book is overpriced for what you get. The font is huge, and there is a lot of white space on all the pages. The material that is covered is good, but many points are overly elaborated. Much of the material can be found online free, although the authors do a good job at fine tuning the information for libraries. The book is oversized, which is inconvenient. The publisher could easily reduce the font size and eliminate some white space and make it the size of a trade paperback. I wish I had saved my money and borrowed this book from my university's library."
1,Not a clearly written text-rambles on !,"Mr.McKnight has a hard time putting simple basic handicapping rules into his text. It is difficult to read and understand his basic premise of speed, condition and class.Any reader would be better off betting the price of the book on a 6/5 favorite at the race track rather than invest in the book"
2,Uprising...,"This book promises much and delivers so little. The stories told by some very notable names are all to often filled with fabrication aimed at building up their street legend or neighborhood. Most prominently the account of the crips as told by Jimel Barnes falls into this category. Big Jimel weaves a tale which is so transparently false that it left me wondering if the man was suffering from signs of dementia. In retrospect I suspect it is merely an advanced case of meglomania.The remainder of the book brings little to the table in terms of substance and meaningful anserws to the problems facing the mutltitude of young men engaged in senseless acts of violence against their own. If you are a thrill seeker or gang groupy looking for alittle direction how real L.A. gang members act and dress then this one is for you. For those seeking true depth and anserws, unfortunately you won't find them here."
5,a MUST get!,this album is great! Elvis Costello and Allen Toussaint are amazing musicians. You have to hear it!
1,More Boring Costello,"Here we have it again. Costello being irritatingly self-indulgent, creating yet another collaboritive album that sounds labored and is truly tiresome to listen to. I guess you can't blame an artist for wanting to continuously stretch his boundaries, but at this point I suspect Elvis is quite incapable of creating a solid, tuneful album with intersting wordplay on par with even Blood and Chocolate, let alone This Year's Model or Imperial Bedroom. Anyone who is sick of Elvis the lounge singer, should check out Graham Parker's recent albums. There's a man who still knows how to record great, gutsy music. With only 8 reviews on the Amazon site, I suspect a great number of fans have jumped off the Costello bandwagon because of recent releases. I wish I had."
4,4 1/2 stars.,"my, mr costello is certainly prolific in the recording studio. yet another album. and hooray, i say. the man rarely, rarely lets one down. this time out he is paired with new orleans great allen toussaint. together they have crafted an extremely fun recording. rock, blues, and funky soul ring out here. mr toussaint's piano playing is filled with infectious enthusiasm and mr costello's vocals are filled with emotion. that costello voice, to me, is stunning. it's ablility to express different moods and a variety of emotions can hardly be bettered in rock music. his songwriting has always gotten attention, but i feel his singing has not recieved the full appreciation from critics that it deserves. anyway, this is a fantastic piece of work. selected by ""no depression"" magazine as the 4th best album of 2006, don't miss it."
4,Doesn't disappoint! Great effort from Costello and Toussaint,This is a strong effort from Messrs. Toussaint and Costello. Some of the songs will stick in your head long after you've played the CD. Well worth the money.
5,"Great CD, Questionable source","I love this CD, it is a new favorite.HOWEVER, it has a Public Library sticker on it. Was this CD stolen? I am going to Google the library and contact them to make sure."
4,Songs For Katrina,"Leave it to Englishman Declan McManus to write a song as succinct as Ascension Day on the subject of the aftermath of hurricane Katrina. ""40 days passed by. 40 alibis."" Our own artists have largely stopped writing songs about real subjects (American Idol, anyone?).Other standout tracks include 6-fingered Man, Broken Promised Land and Who's Gonna Help Brother Get Further?[DW]"
1,Disapointing experience,"The River in ReverseI bought this album without listening it up front. It was a major dispointment when I heard the first song. I thought that my amplifier was broke. The sound of the album is as if it comes out of a very small box; it's very flat. All the other tracks sound the same. It's unbelievable that today, while millions of people are downloading illegal tracks from the internet with lousy mp3 quality, some artists still don't know that real music lovers like to buy their albums and expect to get a great sound for their money. Costello and Toussaint should be ashamed about this production."
3,Wrong Holmes,"Persons contemplating the purchase of ""Dorothy Q"" should bear in mind that it is by the ""Autocrat of the Breakfast Table"", the father of Justice Holmes, and not by the Justice himself, a point missed by the Amazon author link. Holmes, the son, was named after his father and, until the time of his father's death, included ""Jr."" as part of his name. Following the custom of the time, Holmes dropped ""Jr."" upon his father's death in 1894. Thus, ""Oliver Wendell Homes"" refers to the father before 1894 and the son thereafter. Those familiar with the Justice's work know that he did not write novels, but there may be others, beguiled by the Amazon link, who think they are acquiring a novel by the Justice. Not so."
2,"Sometimes entertaining, but no new insights...","If you are seeking further insights into the tragic death of Michael Hutchence, you won't find it here. The majority of the content appears to be gleaned from press articles and a number of interviews with INXS band members over the past several years. Although the book is sometimes entertaining, the author provides no further insights into Mr. Hutchence's suicide than what can be obtained from the band's many web sites. However, the book is entertaining at times and provides a basic history of INXS and Michael Hutchence's meteoric rise to super-stardom and tragic ending. In this sense, the book is worthwhile for new fans of the band. For those fans who have followed INXS since their glory days in the 80s, there is nothing new here."
4,Potentially Excellent Book,"This book has the potential to be an excellent resource on valuation analysis. It was well written and insightful. However, the typos contained in this book prevent it from reaching its true potential. Too often, formulas contained plus signs where there should have been a minus sign or an ""is"" should have been an ""is not."" Although the typos did not ultimately prevent me from understanding the material, I had to work harder than I should have to sort out some of the confusion."
4,Highly recommended.,"This is without doubt the best book on valuation since Graham and Dodd. It thoroughly explains the valuation process from the ground up with simplicity,intuitively and with just the right amount of math.All that one needs to get enchanted by this gifted teacher and writer is commonsense and an understanding of basic school level math.However, I feel that the chapters on measuring growth as well as relative valuation were a bit skimpy. Dr. Damodaran has excellently covered some of these areas in the working papers available on his website. Together, his website and this book present the most powerful learning source that I have found in this fascinating area."
3,(not) disappointed - Update,"Apologies to Mr Damodaran, further to my last 'scathing' review, I have since discovered that Mr Damodaran has conveniently posted the entire Solutions manual to this book on his website."
1,CFrAud,"This book is/was required for the CFA program.Those requirers were required to print pages of errata.Many essential formulas are simply wrong, presumably from sloppiness. Reading the book is a lot like correcting a high schooler's homework.All this courtesy of an organization that publishes its own performance presentation standards and generally, high-handedly nitpicks."
2,A very mathematical approach to business,"This book, although comprehensive, just wasn't descriptive enough. Although the author covers a vast amount of detail, the content is dominated by formulas and lacks an adequate description of ""why"" either via case studies or a description of contemporary issues. If you are looking for a practical valuation guide, this is probably not the book. The book is a good reference for formulas and is very well organized for that purpose."
1,"Garbage In, Garbage Out","Good work, if only it was reliable... In a discipline where accuracy is so important, I am amazed it has been selling so well for so long. The book has plenty of formulae mistakes that make its reading and comprehension really difficult and painfully time-consuming as you need to go through correcting all those errors and read the chapters again and again. Still, even after such an arduous work, you end up not being 100% sure that what you have learnt is correct. Wiley should long ago have retired this edition from circulation and then market a new, thoroughly corrected one. Of course, those (many) unlucky readers who have bought this terrible (paperback) edition should receive a new one for free as soon as it is available. I feel I have been cheated!"
2,Disappointed,"Unfortunately this book has been selected as one of our reading materials for a certain examination I am currently studying for. The worked examples in the book are not always clear which is fair enough, as it is not the first such book. Normally this problem is ironed out by working thru the set problems at the back of each chapter. What is very DISAPPOINTING about this text is that it is the only one in our entire syllabus of reading materials that does not have a Solutions Manual to help with our studying. Mr Damodaran has not bothered making the effort to produce one it seems."
3,One-Sided View of Valuation,"While this is an excellent book on valuing assets using discounted cashflows (DCF), there's scant material dedicated to other valuation methods. Maybe Aswath writes about these subjects in another book, but for completeness at least a chapter or two could've been written about relative valuation, especially considering that most all analysts today use multiples and the like to value stocks.If you want to learn more about DCF valuation including how to calculate free cash flow for various situations, this is a good book (even considering the errors). If instead you'd like to learn about several different valuation methods, then this book falls short."
1,Terrible,"Don't waste your money and time on it. This book has a number of typos, and countless wrong solutions on the author's web site. I felt so frustrated as I read it."
3,so-so,"book was in fine condition. new, small, and thin. however, the layout is not reader-friendly - no more greek letters please. they are hard to read (all those cursives) and hard to know what to call them (after alpha beta and theta, who knows what on earth they are called?). besides, my professor does not really work with this book. his lecture notes are much better."
2,Tight Fit,"This case is great in terms of protection, but the fit is completely hit and miss. Most of the buttons (ex. play, next, ect.) did not fit square into the holes provided. The case is bulky, but gets the job done."
4,Good,Product arrived quickly and not broken up. Fast and quick service. This is my second time order this product and I'm well please with the service. New Customer!
5,Great Powder Makeup,"I love this powder, it gives a perfect, flawless finish to your face. I've gotten several compliments from others since I started using it. A Great Buy!"
4,Posthumous recital recording with excellent musicianship,"This recording is a posthumous release of a recital done in the late 1980's by Harold Wright, and his longtime friend and collaborator Luis Batlle. The selections on this CD include rarely heard works of Romantic era and early modern composers. Despite the recital-hall recording quality, Mr. Wright's legendary expressiveness comes through strongly and is very moving at times. Mr. Batlle is a complete collaborator. I highly recommend this CD."
2,Recording quality is poor,"Another poor quality recording of Harold Wright which was a great disappointment. If you are a clarinetist interested in Wright's musicianship then you have no choice, especially since many of the works are rarely recorded. It is a shame to spend so much money on such a poor quality recording just to hear Wright play, and it does not do his playing justice."

3,"Has moments of greatness, but not perfect","Good CD, not great. CD1 is better with solid house tunes that are variations of songs we all know and love. Some of the new mixes though are not as good as the originals. CD1 starts out great and then fades at the end. CD2 is more techno and drun and bass...I thought it would be all house from the last two summers in Europe and Ibiza."
5,"Firm, tasty and aromatic","I first had these at the Green Festival last year and was thrilled to find them offered by Amazon. I've gone through 6 boxes, but am now switching to another brand for variety. The seeds on these are yummy, overflowing, and the crackers are very hard, creating a bed for softer items like cheese or smoked salmon. I've found that they break along the same way crystals break, so I don't tend to put much on these crackers at all. I usually use them more as a dipper or have a bite of this followed by a bite of that. I keep the opened box in the refrigerator because even though they are consumed over a period of days, I don't like to leave sunflower seeds exposed to the air or heat. I'll buy these again after I go through the case of Ryvita Dark Rye Crackers I just received. BTW, Jason's Deli, a Richmond, VA based restaurant chain offers these crackers in little individually wrapped packages with their salad bar."
1,Expiration Date,"I love the crackers;however, I did not like the fact that I bought 6 packs of these and the expiration dates are within 2 months of the date I purchased them. I had to give some away because I could not eat - nor would I want to - that many crackers in that amount of time."
3,Good but too hard & too crunchy,"I found this cracker to be healthful and better than the run-of-the-mill grocery store crackers; however, they're almost brutal on teeth because they are simply way too hard. Lighten up, Dr. Kracker."
2,Name of product is misleading,"Okay, yes, I know the brand is Dr. Kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product. However, I have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita. These are VERY crunchy and don't have a whole lot of flavor. If you are shopping for a super-healthy cracker, this may be it. If you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita, keep shopping - this is not it. My next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia."
5,Amazingly addictive!!,"I have been buying Doctor Kracker, ""Klassic 3 seed Krackers"", for years. I eat them throughout the day. They are the only thing in my life That I can say I've become addicted too. They are crispy, but no so crispy that they are hard to eat, as some have said. I have a mouth full of veneers and many dental implants and have no problems with eaten them. They are ultra healty and taste great alone without adding anything. I highly recommend trying these."
5,Meets my needs,Dr.Kracker has met my need for something crunchy and sightly salty while being an overwhelmingly healthy snack. I am on a weight-loss diet and have found that judicious use of this product in no way interferes with my goals.
2,Not so good....,"Cpm 22 got some nice punk pop songs, but most of their songs are totally EMO!!! Sorry, but EMO sucks... Desconfio and Atordoado are decent songs, but there's many many many other better bands in Brazil, try Raimundos and Charlie Brown Jr. !!!!!"
4,"Good, but...","I would have given this watch a five star but for the fact that the face of the watch was a little smaller than my expectation. I love big dial/face watches and figured this was one too. But aside from that, i love the bracelet chains, meets my need as a dressy watch. I know Anne Klein watches do not disappoint based on the last ones i used and hope this watch is also the same too."
4,Black Torment,"Sir Richard Fordyce returns to his home after staying in London with his newly married wife. Upon his arrival the people of his estate greet him rather strangely. As it turns out while Fordyce has been away people have sworn that they have seen him at his home, there have also been several young women who have been killed. Fordyce also sees ghostly figures on the grounds of his estate. Is Fordyce slowly going mad or is there something more sinister at play.This one is a dark drama and doesn't offer any humor. It's still great though and John Turner's character here reminds me quite a bit of the one he played in Behemoth the Sea Monster (1959) (another Compton Films production). If you like the other Robert Hartford-Davis (Incense for the Damned (1970), The Fiend (1972)) adaptations, don't miss this one."
