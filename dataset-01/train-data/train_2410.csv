2,Very slow reading.,"The book started out interesting and humorous, but by the the middle it was just dragging. I hate to 'not finish' a book, so I plodded on..... about two weeks of plodding. I love to read and usually finish most books with in three days, provided I have the time after work. This book was torture to get through."
3,I Found this Book Boring,There are very few books I can not finish but this is one of them. Some of the other reviewers called it hilarious but after 100 pages I haven't found anything really funny. I am an animal lover but I guess my interest falls more to the warm blooded mammals so reading about someone trying to bond with birds just doesn't do it for me. The best I can say it is well-edited. It just seems to drone on and on about one bird/rabbit misadventure after another. I never made it to the ducks. I guess I get bored of hearing a different version of the same story over and over again.
5,If you've ever been a chew toy for a bird...you'll love this book.,"Enslaved by Ducks is the story of how the author Bob Tarte (a bonafide city slicker) gave in to his country girl wife, Linda when it came to getting a rabbit named Binky. Binky ends up being a terror on 4 legs for Bob. Bob ends up getting attached to Binky despite his relentless testing of Bob's temper. Bob ends up allowing Linda to expand their ""herd"". Pretty soon they have ducks, parrots and turkeys. Soon Bob realizes he's at the very bottom of the pecking order in his own home. He ends up sharing his dinner with parrots, nursing ducks back to health in his living room, building perches for turkeys and being used as a chew toy for a parrot.I really enjoyed this book and I'm now reading the sequel to it called ""Fowl Weather"" by Bob Tarte."
5,Definitely for animal lovers!,"I loved this book even though I've never experienced ducks, geese, turkeys, etc as pets. The stories about some of the Tarte's animals really left me awed that there are people who go to such lengths to care for their animals. I have dogs & take them to the vet regularly, but they don't require near the work that's required by these ""exotic"" pets - exotic because they are animals other than dogs or cats. Three cheers to Bob & his wife for sharing their lives this way!"
5,delightful but honest,"i bought this as a treat to myself.i loved it so much i bought a copy for a friend of mine who has ducks, chickens, parrots, dogs, cats etc.i also suggested that my husband needed to read this as well, beings he's a city boy married to a country girl with a whole lot of animals.read this if you need a lift and a laugh.don't expect disney, as mr tarte is honest, pets DO die, that unfortunately is a fact of life, but he is closely observant of his animals and their individual distinctive personalities, allowing each animal it's own unique voice.i look forward to reading his next two booksand i suggest you all do as well"
5,"droll, to say the least....","Just like the amazing series by james Herriot, ""All Creatures Great and Small"", you by no means have to be an animal lover to LOVE this book. I amas enamored by Linda, the author's wife, as I am by Stanley Sue, or poor ill-fated Peggy. I want to be just like Linda, sunny and ever willing to take onwhatever, and I also want to be like Stanley Sue, obnoxious and no-nonsense. My only question to the Tartes is: will you get a donkey, already?"
2,Like the third piece of cheesecake,"I would have given the book four stars if it ended after the first chapter or two. Delicious, cute and sweet. But even the world's best cheesecake is cloying by the third slice. It's not that it's a bad book -- open it to any random chapter and you will be entertained, but each chapter is pretty much the same. I had to stop reading 50% through the book, and that was 25% beyond when I had the first thought to close it and walk away."
4,A Fun Read for Pet Lovers of All Kinds.,"A really fun book about maintaining and negotiating a houseful of varied pets. Author Bob Tarte is humorous and self-deprecating in his account of being an innocent bystander in a home that acquires pets the way a dog acquires fleas.Tarte's writing style is smart and funny, and the reader can't help but love the hapless author and his description of a life far beyond his control. As is often the case with people who suddenly find themselves attracting multiple pets, Tarte finds a peace and purpose with his animal companions.- C.A.Wulff, [...]"
5,Too FUNNY!,"This book had me laughing so hard, I was crying!!! Anyone who has animals can relate to this book! The author has such a way with words you'll ""quack"" up almost every page! The day I lugged six 50lb. bags of horse feed, I happened to read about Bob buying 12 bags of sand! I laughed so hard, I totally understood! I called my sister to tell her to read it and then we'd be on the phone everyother day talking about the book and laughing our heads off! What a GREAT book!!!"
3,A nice easy read,"This book was exactly what it is intended to be: a love story disguised as a memoir of a couples experiences raising ducks, with a few other animals thrown in. It's not particularly funny, nor is it educational at the level one would want a 'how to' book to be. It is a nice, easy read with some tragedy, some triumphs, and a level of self disclosure that was unexpected. The author clearly loves his wife and is forthright in acknowledging that his love for her has enabled him, with his naturally passive approach to life, to experience joy on a daily basis."
4,Enslaved By Ducks,An entertaining light romp through the trails and heart aches of caring for and rearing animals and birds.The author keeps your interest with his self depreciating style of story telling.A good light read.
3,"Animal lover, not in love","I am a complete animal lover, advocate, and wanna be accumulator. Naturally, I was completely fascinated with the title of this book. I loved the idea of a husband and wife being swamped by a variety of creatures that the husband (initially, and MOSTLY but with emphasis on the mostly) did not want but obtained per the wife's obsession with helping needy animals of all shapes and sizes. I will admit, there were a few times where I found myself laughing out loud, but those moments were few and far between.All of the chapters were the same essentially, with the only thing changing being the addition of another lovable creature. There were some that had exceptional personalities, but most of the time that only came through when the poor animal was on it's death bed.Would have loved some more ""LOL"" moments documenting the narrators quest to get a step ahead of his dependents, or even more on some of his funny shortcomings when it came to care taking."
2,not good,I really needed a fun book to read while on vacation. Didn't happen with this. I tried very hard to get into this book. It simply was not funny or even interesting. This man simply comes off as being stupid without any direction in his life - but then he pretty much says he's like that on page 1. These animals simply happen to him - he doesn't seek them out - his wife does. It's a little all over the place too.
2,Why Do People Think This is Funny?,"I keep getting suckered in by these ""funny animal stories"" with high user feedback. I slogged all the way through Marley and Me and was ready to shoot myself by the end. OK, I laughed 5 times, but I grimaced 25 and the story was just not that interesting.With Marley under my belt, my tolerance was way down, so I did not finish this book. However, after about 50 pages, I had not laughed once. Again, the story was not that interesting"
2,Didnt really like this one..,I didn't care much for this book. After a few chapters of reading about the many pets this man had in his house it got very boring. I gave up on it.
4,"Not bad...a little funny, a little slow","It struck me as I read through the plethora of pet species these folks gathered (ducks, geese, turkeys, doves, rabbits,cockatoos, etc) that the author and his wife were on a constant search for a loving, responsive, semi-intelligent pet. How bout a nice DOGGIE?! You can train 'em how you want. No more in-house piles of stinky excrement, chewed up wires, destroyed baseboards, etc.I've always wondered if people who collect less responsive species as pets (think spiders, snakes, turkeys) have problems with intimacy. At my home we have many (mostly) mammalian pets and I must say that each of our two rats are more emotionally responsive to us than this author's duckies."
2,Enslaved,"I was enslaved by boredom reading Enslaved by Ducks. Bob Tarte can be funny, but I was struck more by his lack of family connections. This, to me, was a painfully tedious journey through a man's depression and his disturbing inability to establish deeper (human) relationships. An odd and very sad book."
4,a little wordy...,"I liked this book, it contained many funny anecdotes that most pet owners can empathize with. I found it to be somewhat tedious with all the minute descriptions. I would like to have learned more about the relationship between the husband and wife. All in all a good read."
3,Pleasant read,"I enjoyed this book, but I don't think I would include it in my all-time favorites. I am not exactly sure what I was expecting, but I think I was expecting more than this book delivered. Sometimes the stories about the various animals were very good and engaging, but other times I felt the author was a little detached."
2,Not what it's quacked up to be...,I'm sure it would appeal to someone a bit more familiar with avians and their ownership. The fowl humor just didn't quack me up. Disappointing...
3,probably great fun for city folk,"Bob Tarte is a fun writer, to be sure. For me, having been raised on a farm with all sorts of animals and their delightful (as well as otherwise) behaviors this book got a little long for me.But if you wonder what living with a menagerie of pets might be like in real life, its a fun and fast read.I loved Peggy. Well, that's my name so I did think the choice of name fit her personality very well!"
1,Enslaved by Morons,"I had to force myself to finish this book. The author and his wife went through the same cycle for every animal: Buy/rescue an animal, don't research how to care for it, and try to make it sound like a hilarious adventure while said animal is sick or injured. In addition, his self-proclaimed aversion to manual labor makes him the worst person to own half their birds. This book could have had so much potential if only the author & wife possessed any bit of common sense."
3,Doesn't Sustain,"This book starts out great! Very funny - had me laughing out loud! However, I found when I had about 100 pages left I couldn't pick it up to read. It seemed to get redundant, and coulldn't hold my attention. Tart is certainly a great writer, and it is different to read about a bird fanatic! However, the excellent beginning just couldn't sustain through the end."
3,review of Enslaved by Ducks,The book was interesting but not one you couldn't put down. The author basically wrote about a year in his life with his pets.
2,Ducks,"This book was long and tended to repeat itself. The author thought he was funnier than he really is. I would not recommend this book, it's rather boring."
5,Wonderfully funny,I was amazed to find there are other couples who live their lives around the needs of their many pets. Not only entertaining but an affirmation that it is not such a singular way to live.
5,"Enthralled by ""Enslaved by Ducks""","I read this book in one sitting. I found myself laughing with Bob while sharing his experiences with a house (and barn) full of critters. The book covers ducks, turkeys, geese, two cats, various and sundry bunnies and a house full of foul fowl. A must-read for anyone who has ever owned a pet and suspected that they, too, are ""enslaved""."
4,Delightful Pet Saga,"Enslaved by Ducks is Bob Tarte's wry, self-effacing ode to his wife, Linda, and the pets who fill their home, barn and barnyard. The pets are chiefly avian-- parrots, canaries, doves, starlings, turkeys, geese and the ducks of the title-- as well as rabbits and cats. All are enthusiastically adopted by Linda Tarte and, sometimes less so, by husband and author Bob.Enslaved by Ducks is the perfect feel-good book for those entranced by pets, particularly bird-fanciers. Tarte's low-key humor goes down easily, and the animals' antics-- never dull-- range from the exasperating to the hilarious to the touching. Not a bird fancier myself, I was nonetheless touched at the depth of feeling shown by the Tartes' birds-- they are indeed capable of a full range of emotions, including love. The same is true, of course, of the Tartes' other pets.If you are an animal fancier in need of a heartening read, try Enslaved by Ducks."
5,Laugh out loud funny!,"I just started reading this book yesterday and I can't stop laughing! Have laughed until I've got tears in my eyes! I had to read several pages of it out loud to my husband and 16 yr old daughter because I found it so entertaining (they loved it too!)!I own a chinchilla that I've had about 6 mos that we took in because her previous owner could no longer care for her. She's probably the worst pet I've ever owned and after having had one of my most trying days with her today, reading this book tonight really struck a note with me. My problems seem to pale in comparison to what these people have been through with their crazy pets! Of course, it just makes me think, who are the real crazies here - the animals or us, the owners?!I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is an animal lover like myself. It's one of the most entertaining books I've picked up in a very long time!"
2,Rather pointless,"Would make good anectotes to share in person, but not worth my time as a book. Just ok, if you really can't find anything else."
3,Good easy read.,"If you are looking for literature do not stop here, however if you want something to relax with and get your mind off the day, this is a good diversion. I found the authors writing readable, but uninspiring. The prose was bland and I never connected on any emotional level, yet I continued to read night after night as a relaxing bed time read. I am normally a voracious reader so it was somewhat of a relief to be able to put a book down without feeling that intense need to continue compulsion that sometimes leaves me longing for more when other priorities infringe on my reading time. I did learn a few things about avian behavior and clearly the author is committed to his birds. The writing just didn't inspire me to run out and scour the bird classified or long for the rural life."
5,Fast funny read for animal lovers,"If you have ever kept an pet bird or had pets of any kind and applied human personality traits to them, you will laugh until your sides hurt"
4,Lots of fun,Bob's dry sense of humor is a gem. I was transported to his alternate universe. Bob misses nothing in his observations.
3,Warm and Fuzzy,"This is a warm and fuzzy book about a one man's (and wife's) menagerie. Altogether believable and heartfelt, the reader can understand that pets can overtake your life and heart, no matter how common or exotic they may be. The book is entertaining, although a bit long, but thoroughly enjoyable."
3,whiney,"I wanted this to be like ""Chickens, Mules and Two Old Fools"" by Victoria Twead. Wrong!! It was full of self-effacing whining and marital spinelessness. Although I was fascinated with tidbits about the animals - many little things I never knew - I was bored with the endless fence building! I got interested along the lines of rescuing animals from each other and health problems and the writer proved his mettle at the end. At least 75% almost made me stop reading and I would have missed the decent ending."
4,It's okay,I stuck with it. It was enjoyable. Not my favorite book ever. Partly i just can't imagine liking/loving ducks that much. It kind of jumps around in time (or i'm confused).
3,Enslaved by Ducks,"I love animals and usually like books that contain animals as a main part of the story. But, I could not wait for this book to end. It was redundant, and boring."
3,Was over it halfway through.,"I love pets, I really do. The book had humerous moments, but mostly served as good reading to help put me to sleep at night. As far as animals running, hopping, flying, chewing and pooping in the house... all I can say is REALLY?"
2,Too wordy for me,Though I read this book while watching my ducks splash in my bath tub recovering from frozen eyes. It was not worth my time reading this book.
2,Fast read,"One would think that this man was slightly off to have so many animals in the house and on the farm. He paints a realistic portrait of living with and caring for so many animals. One has to wonder, though, what his house looks like if the animals are on the loose as often as he says."
1,Enslaved by Ducks,Quit reading at 50%. That took an hour. These people don't learn from their mistakes. They did not have relationships with their animals...just kind of observed the chaos their uninformed caretaking created. It felt like a sophmore creative writing student's overwrought efforts to impress his teacher. Would not recommend to anyone.
2,Ducks,Started off good but got rather boring tword the end now reading by a skip forward. But well worth the paice.
1,I wanted to like this book,"I really did. I love books about animals. I read the James Herriot books for the first time when I was 9 years old and they were frequent re-reads as I was growing up. We always had animals around when I was growing up: dogs, cats, rabbits, horses. But this book Enslaved By Ducks is just plain boring. I finally put it down about halfway through--- I couldn't make it any farther. The animals aren't sympathetic. The narrative isn't fun to read. And anybody who lets rabbits run around inside their house... is asking for it. Asking for their cables to be chewed and chair legs to be gnawed and never mind the ""m n m's"" all over the place!! So why is it surprising (never mind ""funny"") when that's what happens? I just don't get this. No stories in this book (as far as I read, anyway) are more than mildly amusing. If you haven't read All Creatures Great and Small and its sequels, go for those instead. Those stories are nothing short of wonderful."
1,Boring . . . .,"I agree with others who found this book boring. I didn't even make it a quarter through the book before I decided I'd had enough! It's very seldom I don't finish a book. I used to think that if I started a book, I must finish it. Finally, I've arrived at the point that I can see no reason wasting my time on a book I don't like."
3,Missed the laugh out loud experience hoped for,"I was so hoping to share the same laugh out loud experience that the critic described, but didn't. I was determined to finish the book and glad I did, but it wasn't until the 200th page that I was finally caught wanting to know how the story ended. It seemed to me that the author didn't find his real writing with humor ability until the last 100 pages of the book. I will say that if you have a heart for fowl or especially a heart for rescuing fowl, reading this book would give you insight to those situations that might otherwise remain a mystery."
3,Odd Book,This is a pretty odd book and not sure what the purpose of writing it was other than to share with others all of the pets that the family owned over time.
1,Enslaved by ducks,I had a hard time reading this book. I found it a little boring. I felt sad when the animals died and found it depressing. People like this are special.
2,Couldn't get into the story.,"Couldn't get into the story or relate to the characters. Only read about 20 pages, so it could be my fault. I expected a cute tale about animals, but the author was into himself so much, I could hardly tell there were animals involved."
4,"Entertaining, funny book","I heard positive things about this book so I bought it. I enjoyed the book as much as a non-animal lover can love such an account. I have to admit, if I had all those animals in my house day and night, it would drive me to distraction but I give a lot of credit to this couple. However, if they were to read this they might scowl in confusion, not knowing what's so remarkable about caring for pets to which they became easily attached. There are few books that reveal the particular personalities of animals quite like this one does. The fact that I happily completed the book is saying a lot."
4,enchanting!,"This was an entertaining read. Enslaved by Ducks is the first of two books telling the story of Bob Tarte, His wife and family of pets. The author tells of being a young man who was completely disinterested in the animal kingdom to someone who has learned the joys of life with pets after being dragged kicking and screaming into this knowledge by his wife Linda. Linda is a unique individual whose empathy with animals is legendary.Their story is told by Bob himself in such a humorous and entertaining way that fifty pages into this book I had purchased the next one, Fowl Weather. I recommend them both."
4,Enslaved By Ducks,"I enjoyed the book, well written and comical, and I would like to read more by the author in the future"
2,FEATHERED PETS,"I learned lots about fowls for pets - mostly that I'll stick to the furry kind. Witty at some points, but I couldn't wait til it was over..."
2,Cute,It was a cute book but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to others. I was left a little confused about how the author actually made a living and how they could afford the many animals they rescued. As an animal lover I can understand taking in unwanted pets but I never really got the feeling that he was as attached to the animals as his actions indicated. I can't really put it into words but there was something missing that didn't quite make me feel it was truly heartfelt.
5,"This is what it is like to be a real animal care giver for multiple animals... Real life, Real funny!!!","I loved this book. I have a lot of animals. Some ""usual"" pets some ""unusual"" pets. Bob tells the real story as it really is. He made me laugh so hard. I could totally relate to his experience. Funny Funny read. Really worth it!!"
1,10-year-old software incompatible with Windows XP,"This software was published in 1998, written for Windows 3.1. The setup has been slightly modified to install on Windows 95. It forces installation of an old version of QuickTime for Windows 3.1, and will only run at a screen resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. My 15"" laptop LCD screen is 1024 x 768 pixels, so this runs only on a 9"" diagonal section of the screen. Since it was not written for XP, plan on letting your kindergartener run with admin privileges, as it's the only way this software will run, if you can ever get it to install. It was nice that the publisher took the time to update the box with claims that it's XP-compatible. It would have been nicer if they had actually spent a few hours updating the software so that it actually was XP-compatible."
1,Don't buy it!!!,"Don't buy it!!! It's a complete waste of money. Even though the DVD version was released in October of 2004 (don't be fooled by the picture on the box), the material on this DVD is at least 10 years old and really outdated. This yoga DVD must have also been done on a really low budget since it looks like it was recorded in someone's apartment. There is no music during the exercises, which makes the workout even more boring. I couldn't even watch the whole thing, and I am definitely not exercising to this DVD."
4,Takes the edge off,"I purchased these over the counter for more $ and less tablets. This was following a dx of IC and no relief from prescriptions, bladder instillations, and diet modification. Definitely worth purchasing on amazon- more tabs, less $, quick shipping. I take 2 at bedtime and before any questionable stuff ( sweetener, coffee, tomato based stuff). I would say the biggest difference for me is decreased trips to urinate at night (now down to 2 from 4 or 5) plus I don't feel I have to run. I also no longer have dreams where I had to pee, so I'm guessing my bladder is feeling better! Next time I get a uti I plan to take them right away to see if they help prevent a flare. I've also had some relief from daily Zyrtec and Zantac twice daily. Glad I found this product! I'll keep it on my cupboard from now on. Thanks for offering this product, wish I knew about this years ago!"
5,Acid killer,"For me, at least, this product is more effective than any of the common OTC anti-acid products. If you take it at the same time as an offending food, the acid never happens.Have Barrett's and cancer so have to be very careful."
5,Prelief,I have been taking this product for about 10 years and it has been wonderful. I have Interstitial Cystitis and it has been GREAT. Without it I would not be able to eat anything that I like. I have been able to eat or drink just about anything I want.
5,"Eat Fruits, Veggies, Sauces, Etc. Without Discomfort","My husband cannot tolerate any acidic foods. This includes red sauces, any fruit juices or fruit, or even things like apple pie. If he takes Prelief before a meal he is completely fine. He has used medications like Zantac when he is in a pinch (Prelief is not available in any of our local stores and we need to order online), and they do not work nearly as well."
5,Prelief gave me my life back,"I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis 15 years ago, and the first year was a nightmare. My diet was terribly restricted, and the pain if I ate anything acidic was awful. I met the developer of Prelief at an IC conference, and took home some samples. The difference was almost immediate. Since then, I have introduced Prelief to a number of friends. Although I buy mine online, I wish it was available in more stores. If they ever stop manufacturing it, I'd be sunk!"
5,Lifemsaver- excellent for chronic heartburn,"I just came of the prescription Dexilent, which works awesome by itself to relieve heartburn and gas reflux. However, it is very expensive is not covered by my current health plan. They do provide discounts, but the drugs still costs in excess of 100 dollars per month. I've been taking pre leif now for several months and decided to try pre lief by itself. That did not work as well as I like, so I now use this in combination with Zack grid and it works like a charm. My out of pocket monthly expense is reduced by 100 dollars and I still excellent release of heartburn"
5,Help for Interstitial cystitis,"This products works wonders for me. I have interstitial cystitis and dread the painful, burning feeling I would get after eating acidic foods. BUT this product helps cut down the acidity and most of the time I dont get any discomfort after eating the foods I love (pizza, tomatoe products, etc). I defintly recommend Prelief to all IC sufferers!"
5,Prelief Review,"AKPHARMA PRELIEF, 300 Tab, by PreliefI have been using Prelief for close to ten years now, with great success. My urologist reccomended it to me for my condition, IC (Interstitial Cystitis). I would not be without this product, as a part of my maintainance health care plan!!"
4,It may work.,I was advised by a specialist to use this to combat an acid urine problem. It may act as a preventative but it doesn't seem to help once the condition occurs. I take it in hopes of keeping the condition quiet.
3,"some OK, some so-so","The 60's was a time of change, and that includes the music. Some I liked; some I didn't like; some I like now that I didn't then.The best thing I can suggest is listen to the sound clips first before buying unless you already know the songs."
4,great personalized compartments,"I opted for the largest bin to hold all my jewelry and glad that I did. It works great to hold various jewelry sizes. Especially since you can create the bins to your liking. It's sturdy and works well. I will just say that if you flip the container upside down, the seal isn't tight so your jewelry may get inter-changed amongst bins. That is probably the only set back. It must be kept faced up."
5,guitars need not apply,"i think the best part of this album is that it makes you realize what made sleep great and it wasn't matt pikes little guitar solo's (which have improved greatly over the years, but, c'mon... ) it's the undeniable rhythm section... and on this record they are able to shine. ignoring the typical billy anderson cardboard box recording sound, this record captures all that was great about sleep, stoned out vocals, the epic song lengths of their later work and the sabbath-y tempo's of holy mountain. the drumming never gets boring, even after 20 minutes at the same tempo, and the bass work is a distillation of all that is stoner metal. i got to see them live two nights in a row in san francisco and they really owned, best ""metal"" band performance i have ever seen.but buy it on vinyl!!!!!"
2,bad lyrics/bad singing,I love the sludge and the roar but the vocals are monotone and the lyrics laughable. Gimme Earth or SunnO))) anyday.
2,TO OLD,"This CD is old and the ""flashcards"" it says it has are not really flashcards, they are just questions on the computer.It may add on to a study plan however."
4,"Very entertaining, humorous, and true!","My wife, who is South African, and I watched and thoroughly enjoyed this humorous ""documentary."" It really does give a true overview of what is Jo'burg.Of course, no one sitting could cover every single aspect of life, politics, economics, crime, etc., etc., etc. in South Africa. But this movie covers a lot of ground and does a good job of presenting the material entailed."
5,delivery on time and great movie,"the movie was delivered on time and it was a great movie, well at least we thought so! I've seen it before but thought it was good. I am not the writing type but it was about how he came about getting $10,000 and they had to start running. I don't know what to say except people would have to watch it on their own and see what they think!! It was good though!"
3,B. Hope as dad and P. Diller as mom & kids hiding from mob,A old movie that is still a lot of fun to see if you can find it. the two parents and six kids hiding from the mob... a real hope/diller sit.
3,a bit over simplified,"This is a good overview of yoga but a bit over simplified for true enthusiasts. I think the seven spiritual laws, while worthy in their own right, are not necessarily apt for asana practice."
3,Half Good,"The coverage of the junior chess circuit and Washington square chess matches is compelling reading, but the chapters on the Soviet refusniks are too in depth and out of place."
5,Awesome!,"Have the book and movie on DVD. This is one of my favorite books and movies. Though they weren't searching for Bobby Fischer himself, the move shows the progress of a talented chess kid."
2,comes without a microphone cable!!,"This mic seems decent so far, but it comes without a microphone cable. What's up with that? Very disappointed. I had to use the cable off another microphone to try it out. The sound quality (for vocals) is reasonable but not stellar."
5,Memphis Mag,"We have subscribed since it's inception, along with magazines for other cities we frequent (we live in a suburb of Memphis). It gives you a lot of great information and its restaurant listings in the back are most helpful, especially when a new one appears. We love the ""Ask Vance"" column about old Memphis (pre 1965) as we have both lived here most of our lives and we are now retired. We frequently give gift subscriptions to newcomers.If you plan on coming for Memphis in May (our annual month-long festival) it gives you great coverage so you know when to come for things like the BBQ contest or Sunset Symphony. (If you plan on coming this year, better make hotel reservations NOW)."
4,A nice addition to the MVP series,"This game is the 2005 version. I was surprised when I saw thatthe graphics aren't quite as good as last years', though I am not saying the graphics were bad. However, I care more about the gameplay than the graphics so I don't care. To my dumb 11 year old friend, just because the graphics were just a bit off, they are HORRIBLE.I like the create a player. I made mine a pitcher and struck outAlex Rodriguez three times. I suggest you make a player.I like the overall just like the freeness in this game, like make your ownpark.If this were school work, I would grade this with an A-."
1,Out of Date. Doesn't stand the test of time. 2005 was a miss.,"This game kind of sucks. Baseball doesn't really translate to video games as well as other pro sports. The newer games offer better game play and better story but don't compare to football, soccer, and video hockey."
4,MVP Baseball 2004,The game is fun to play but the pitch location is a little awkward (it's difficult to pick location without tipping to the batter).
3,Worth the money!,I bought the two as a pair and together the books have been helpful. But if you are looking to take a place for just your Licensure then you will need to look for other study sources. The books are geared more for the general place test.
1,Worthless!,Don't waste your money. Toilet paper is a lot cheaper than this book (which is about all it can be used for).
4,A deal on this excellent recording,"I originally had this performance on LP (and saw a very similar performance at the Met). Having recently acquired it again on CD, the only complaint I'm going to mention is with the recording, balance is occasionally off and there are fortissimo sections seemingly recorded at too high a level (the music seems to flare, or blare -- sorry if my terminology is askew). For those who have complained about the high price, I too put off this purchase due to cost. However (and I don't know if I can get away with stating this here), the recording is more widely available in Europe and you can acquire it via the web through European sellers whose prices are a good deal more reasonable. The service I used is a classical distributor out of Birmingham, England called Crotchet (the English term for a quarter-note); their service was impeccable and the price was approximately $43 U.S. Crotchet can be contacted through www.crotchet.co.uk."
2,Rip-off,"This is a fine recording, which Amazon says it will deliver free. At the ludicrous price it's asking, it should hand-deliver it to your doorstep. Either there's a mistake in the pricing, or Amazon got taken by a distributor. In either case, one should look elsewhere; the CD is available from other domestic vendors for at least $20 less, and from UK sources for even less. As far as the recording itself, I prefer Sutherland in her earlier recording, but the tenor (Duval) there is pretty bad - though I don't think Pavarotti is all that much better. The sound of course is much better on this effort. Four stars for the performance."
1,WARNING,"Listening to this recording could cause extreme sleepiness. Do not listen while driving. On the other hand, listen to cure any case of insomnia. Guaranteed, cuz Sutherland is extremely boring to listen to in this recording. To reverse sleepiness, listen to Sutherland's La Fille du Regiment. THAT will get you awake and enjoying amazing coloratura!"
1,it's worth restating,"It's worth restating that Callas is the queen of bel canto for a reason. She sings AND acts. That can't be said of the boring renditions by Sutherland and Pavarotti. Both of these singers were known for doing a lot of ""stand-and-sing"" on stage. Callas on the other hand was an infinitely greater actress and sung beautifully and gracefully. And like another review puts it, it isn't worth shelling out such a huge wad of cash for this recording when you can get the much better Puritani with Callas, at a much lower cost. Bel Canto belongs to Callas, not Sutherland!"
2,bad graphics,"I bought this game thinking it was going to have good graphics, I was wrong. Overall, the game is OK, but that's about it, OK."
4,One great girls bike !,"I purchased this girls mountain bike for my daughter for Christmas. Very well made Schwinn, quality item. And was promptly shipped and received. Not a difficult assembly. And my daughter loves it."
3,Free with a pack of Zima,This is funny. I remember when this first came out you could get it free on the inside of a 12 pack of Zima. I saw an add for this and went out that day and bought some Zima.I think I was really into Sam Phillips and PWEI at the time. I don't believe this version of Karmadrome was on the actual PWEI CD...could be wrong. My CD still has a $2 off coupon for the Dumb and Dumber soundtrack and a form to sign up for a Zima newsletter. I wonder what would happen if I filled it out now and sent it in fifteen years later...
1,not very good; had less than a year and have to replace,Repair man had to come out... says modem is shot... have to buy another one. He recommends Motorola or Linksys... No more D-Link for me!
1,Works great for a few months then it is crap!,Easy to set up and worked great for 2 months then it just stopped working. Horrible customer service! Will never buy from this company again!!
4,Easy,"It works with Cox... only needed to give them my MAC address and I was up and running in no time. No complaints for the frist few days. I'll update if I have issues later. Running with a Netgear router over Ethernet, no issues. Bought because I love my Dlink NAS, and I've known lots of people have issues with the Cox-reccommended Motorola modems."
4,DM-202 Modem,"Modem arrived after a short wait. Modem was packaged as promised, except that the bar code was removed. Modem works great."
1,"Don't buy it, connection dropped constently!","I own several D-Link products, including router, printserver, and USB hub, they work pretty well, since D-Link's good reputation, I purchased this DCM-202 cable modem for my new cable internet installation, it worked for a few hours, then the connection started to drop constently every 3-4 hours, especially when downloading big files and causing heavy downstream traffic. I had to reset it when connection was dropped. I have read several reviews about the connection drop issue before I bought it, I still gave it a try, it really disapppoited me. I think D-Link makes good networking products, but not this cable modem. I will get a Motorola Cable modem to replace this D-Link DCM-202. If you are looking for a cable modem, it's better not to try this one, don't waste you time."
1,Constantly needs to be reset,I got this in December. After a couple of months it had to be reset 1-3 times a day to get the internet back up. My cable service specs were excellent. I got a Motorola SB 6120 and immediately no problems now. Internet stays up 24/7. I would avoid this product.
2,Expect it to stop working after one year,"By now, I think I am done with D-link products. I have owned both D-link Router and Cable Modem, but both of them stopped working after one year.(right after the warranty expired) Within the 1st year, it works ok, just need to reset it few times occasionally. But after a year, my internet connection started to keep dropping. Sometimes, it could be like disconnect every 30 mins. I had tried to fix it by upgrade the firmware on it, but no luck. I think the hardware just broke down after a year. Now I am getting the Motorola cable modem as a replacement, will see how this one work out. But I will recommend to stay away from this Cable Modem. It may be a bit cheaper than the MOtorola one, but you should expect it to break down after a year."
1,Do Not Buy D-LINK,"I have had problems with the DCM202 after about 5 months. It has defects that dlink is not wanting to fix, so they will never receive my business again. I have experienced similar problems as some of the other reviews with the same horrible customer service. I spent over an hour with my ISP to determine that my modem was faulty. I was not willing however to play the games of staying on the phone for hours trouble shooting the modem with dlink. The customer service is very troubling. They were unwilling to issue an rma unless I was willing to spend many more hours on the phone. They know that most customers do not have the time to do this and use this to their advantage. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand. There are many other quality products that I am positive will serve you better."
2,Worked OK for a while...now it's semi-operational paperweight,"I've owned and operated the D-Link DCM-202 cable modem for around 3 years, initially it worked OK when paired with a D-Link b/g wireless router (neither purchased from Amazon). A year ago the D-Link wireless router stopped functioning, replaced it with a Cisco wireless router which works great. That combination worked great for about 9 months. Now my internet connection is constantly dropping off and I'm suspecting the cable modem as the root cause. It has been a major pain because we have Vonage phone service. The whole modem, router, Vongage box combo has to be re-booted at least once a day right now. I believe the D-Link hardware just isn't reliable in the long term and won't consider it for future networking purchases."
2,"On Comcast, ended up replacing it","I originally bought this modem when I subscribed to Comcast internet service, but had a series of problems that we eventually traced back to the modem. Replaced it with the Motorola modem and things are working well. The problem could have been an issue with the particular unit I had or a general problem; I did read quite a bit about Comcast customers having troubles with this unit."
4,Cable Modem,"I had to replace it twice, but it eventually worked. I seems faster than my previous cable modem and it was a good price."
3,Signal not as strong as previous Motorola Surfboard 5100,"When lightning struck my Motorola Surfboard 5100 cable modem and fried the ethernet port, I decided to try a D-Link cable modem hoping for better compatibility with my D-Link router. I ended up having to re-position this modem closer to the main cable feed into the house because it couldn't pick up a consistent signal from my cable company. It works fine now that it is tethered to a 10 ft cable line, but then I found out my D-Link Router was also fried by the same lightning strike that killed the Motorola modem. Knowing what I know now, I would have purchased another Motorola Surfboard modem. It didn't have any problem picking up the cable signal at the end of a 75 foot cable."
5,SCREAMS!!!!,"Though not listed as one accepted by COX High Speed, I took a chance and got lucky. Boy did I ever!! With the rebate, this is less expensive than the other cable modem models and it gets the job done. Very easy hook up, Tech support needed a little from Cox....but found out very quick it was Cox's fault and not the modems. They fixed really quick on their side and off I was screaming down the broadband highway. Definitely a Great Choice!!"
1,No go with Comcast,"I tried two of these modems on my Comcast connection. It would loose the connection (you couldn't ping your default gateway on the comcast network) at random times for as long as 30 seconds at random times.It was impossible to use this modem with Vonage or other services that expect a reliable connection to function.I have lot of other D-Link equipment, and typically recommend their hardware, but I would recommend staying away from this modem at least on a Comcast connection."
4,Dlink Dcm-202,"Good docsis modem compatible with comcast cable systems. Comcast is converting to docsis 3.0 in some areas and this modem is not compatible with their new systems to fully take advantage of comcasts higher broadband speed. However, it is a sturdy modem within an acceptable price range."
4,Works fine,It works as well if not better than the one I have beeen renting form the cable. I was paying $7 rental. Therefore pay back will be in 8 months.
4,Works as advertised. Nice size and good LED readout.,Overall a good cable modem. Doing it's job as good as the motorola unit that my cable company was leasing to me. It is no faster nor slower than previously modem I used. I like that it is a bit smaller than my previous model.[...]
2,Very wrong cable modem,"It workED fine first month then it get slower and slower , sometimes I could only get 20 Kbp/s, turn it off and back on again, performance get much better for couple hours and then it slow down again. Faulty product! Downloading from the same website, my sister got 900Kbp/s , I got max 200 Kbp/s(after turn off and back on). Disapointed !!!"
2,Neither Fail-Safe nor Fail-Seldom,"Ran fine for just over a year. Pointedly, this took it just beyond the warranty period. Then, the converter in the AC power cord failed, mearly bursting into flames. Unfortunately, the failure mode also took out the modem itself. So, instead of a $15 power cord, I got to replace the whole modem. I bought a different brand this time, with a 3-year warranty. Ominously, however, both modems were made in China."
1,Do Not Buy!,"I signed up to Comcast just two months ago and when I signed up, the website linked me to a store selling this modem. I purchased this modem as it was the first one on the list. While fine for the internet, it does not work with Skype video calls. Whenever I try to do video calls in Skype, the modem spontaneously restarts itself after 5 minutes on the call, thus dropping the call. This repeats ad nauseum. After some research on the web, I found this is a common problem with this modem and one user recommended the Motorola SB6120. I'll be throwing this modem out."
1,stop working after 2 months,"it stop working after 2 months. The power and cable lights are green, but other lights are completely off. Spent more than 30 minutes on the phone with tech support in order to get the case Id for RMA, and did all the stupid things they asked, like after run ipconfig to get media disconnected, then go to the web browser and browse for google, yahoo,....not sure if they understand or just want people to give up. Anyway, Not like any other manufacture, you just return the unit that did not work and get back the same item. They asked to return the box like the original, so don't throw away any paper like manual,...like i did and the manual cost $20...It totally wasted my time, I won't buy dlink product anymore"
4,Good Product,"Easy to install does exactly what it says it would and was shipped in a timely manner. Bought if for Comcast cable instead of renting a modem, would buy another one if needed."
4,Possible problem for Comcast customers,"I bought this cable modem when I moved into my new apartment because it would be cheaper than renting one from Comcast in the long run. Everything worked fine for about a month, but then I wouldn't be able to connect to anything outside of my local network. Comcast technical support said that from their end it didn't look like anyting was connecting to their network, and my router could release and renew its IP address, so that narrowed it down to the cable modem. Unplugging the modem and plugging it back in would make it work again for 30-45 minutes at a time, but it would cut out at random without warning.I downloaded and installed new firmware from d-link's website that was specifically for Comcast customers and everything seems to be working ok again, but I know a lot of non-technical people who wouldn't be comfortable doing that. If you are a technically unsaavy person and use comcast, you may want to purchase another cable modem all together."
5,Good Stuff,"I figured it would work great from the start. I read alot of the reviews prior to purchasing this product, so I didn't worry so much about the performance. But, the one thing I didn't really think about when I purchased this - was the fact that it actually looks pretty cool! Everytime I walk by it and I say ""Hey, that looks cool."" That's always a plus. Buy it people! Works great and looks cool."
4,Works great,"I was a little concerned about this DCM-202 modem after reading the reviews on the heat and also firmware upgrade for Comcast ISP. However; after finding the unbeatable price with rebate from Amazon.com, I decided to buy it. I prepared all the new Firmware 2.01 upgrade before the modem arrived and spent 10 minutes to upgrade the firmware when I received the modem. I did not upgrade the 2.01 firmware successfully the first time but I did upgrade successfully the second time. There is no issue whatoever with the modem. There is only some issue to register my modem the 1st time and it took a second phone call to register it. Perhaps I called Comcast to register my modem before I upgraded the firmware for Comcast customer. I could have given it a 5 stars but the firmware upgrade took a small effort so I give it a 4.5 stars intead. Anyway, highly recommend the Dlink DCM-202 cable modem for the price, performance, and the small footprint."
1,Just couldn't hold a connection,"My toshiba modem broke after a year and this one looked cool so i got it. Worked fine for about a week, then couldn't hold a signal for more than a day. Lost connection then I'd Unplug wait and plug back in. You know the drill. work, stop. over and over.Replaced it with a motorola surfboard. A full year later and never a single drop. Not the computer, same connection, problem was clearly the modem.Cheers"
2,Not fully compatible with Comcast :(,"I suppose it's not necessarily the fault of this device; it claims to be DOCSIS 2.0 compatible, but Comcast only supports it with DOCSIS1.0 meaning you will not get Boost! speeds, and who knows what else in the future.I do regret purchasing this now, but if you don't have Comcast my understanding is that it should be fine for you."
5,GREAT DOG BED,THIS IS REALLY A GREAT DOGS BED.IT IS VERY EASY TO KEEP CLEAN.OUR DOG HAS TAKEN TO ITAS OF DAY ONE.WELL WORTH THE MONEY.
5,I have the juju,This is an excellent story about a hunter who is trying to find a cure from a witch herbalist. Like in his other books the main character seems to embody several characters which is taken to its extreme by the end of the book when is judged by the spirit of his kidney (called Judge Kidney).Tutuola is one of the best known Nigerian authors. His writing style is unique and his talent has been promoted by no less than Dylan Thomas and T.S. Eliot. You really should read this book.
3,A good history of the automobile,Some great photos - not bad for the coffee table of the automobile enthusiast.
3,Peter Sellars strikes again,"I was pleased to come across a new opera with an interesting plot, well-written libretto and enjoyable music, very well performed by the three soloists, a well-drilled choir and orchestra. I would have enjoyed it more if Peter Sellars and his set designer had not done everything in their power to distract my attention from the opera's content by setting it not in a medieval chateau and citadel as intended but in some sort of futuristic fairground which required the protagonists to splash around fully dressed in water at the highest points of their passion. Come to think of it, I have yet to experience a Peter Sellars production that doesn't distract attention from the work's attractions"
5,Sympathetic help for parents,"This book makes you feel as if a good friend has just sat down with you over a cup of coffee and listened to all your concerns about your child, and then tells you everything practical you need to know. Debby Waldman, who has gone through this, explores the complicated and powerless feelings parents may have, as much as she does the technical, scientific explanations that parents need. And she does both with humor, with understanding and with good common sense. She tackles everything from the first inkling that there might be a problem to taking care of the hearing aids and dealing with the school officials. A wonderful, comforting resource as well as a pat on the back."
2,great product,"was as described,,bought for mainly bed extermination.if u read up on them it can take over a yr, to exterminate them,they can hide in recluse,,hibernation for up to yr,,has made some difference..thank you,,also used taken internally cleean system of things try reading up other uses,,thank you very much"
3,amount received is not as ordered,"package must not have been repackaged by weight because there were only 13 oz in the bag instead of the 16 it takes to equal a pound, cant speak of the quality of the product yet, as i dont know if it works, though it is killing aunts it does not seem to be killing fleas as quickly as other de i have used, though our dogs one in particular actually likes the taste of it...though he will eat any thing...i take it my self as well but wont see effects for a bit still. will update when and if i do ."
4,Great product,"Food Grade DE is one of the best items you can get for your garden.The only issue I had is there was a hole in the bag and some of it had leaked out, however, it weighed over 1lb so I feel like that made up for that.Used the rest of mine up this summer (it lasted for 2 summers in a small garden) and will order again in the spring."
2,Didn't work for me as a front pocket wallet,"This is supposed to be a front pocket wallet (so it says on the package) but practically it is too bulky for this. The dimensions of the wallet are OK but the money clip makes it too bulky and eventually I could not use it in my front pocket.Build quality and materials are good (as with a number of Fossil wallets I had over the years). Price is reasonable too, I got mine at Macy's."
4,Good Wallet,"I've been using these type of front pocket wallets for over 10 years now, ever since an elbow surgery made me unable to pull my wallet out of my back pocket for about 3 months.It's good quality and lasts a long time, with this being my third one on 10 years. It holds your cash, credit cards inside, with 2 sleeves under the cardholders and an outside see through plastic sleeve that I put my company ID and keycard in.The only problem I've had with these is after a few years the metal loop on the outside that you clip your cash in tend to break after a few years. Not at the hinge, but at the bend point at the bottom."
1,Great Wallet Poor Quality,Not sure what fossil has done to their wallets. The first one of these that I bought from Boscov's lasted almost 2 years. I purchase another when the binding where it folds started to crack. The new one came looked exactly the same. However after two months of wear the stitching on the inside of this has started to split. And I do not carry alot of cards in my wallet. Less than what I carried in the old wallet. Not thrilled at all that the quality of this wallet is hitting the skids.
2,Salty,"Purchased these for my sons lunch box, and can't do it, they are too salty. He's always been happy with Veggy booty, and that is what he'll continue to get."
2,Used to love them - October 2009,"I have been buying these through Amazon for over a year now and frequently put them in my daughters' lunches and they really like them (so do I). We just received a new order and I gave them to the girls on Friday. They both came home telling me that they did not like them and that they did not taste the same. I just tried some now, and they are right. There is no cheese flavor that they used to have, just a crunchy stick which is kind of dry. Not sure if they changed how they are made."
5,A great opera.,"Puccini's masterful opera is sung wonderfully on this cd. The singers truly capture the beauty and emotion of this classic opera about betrayal, love and war."
3,Let the singers come onstage,"Yes. This is a powerfully interpreted musical production. Yes. The orchestra, under Karajan's direction, is superb. But why are the principal singers placed in such a way that it sounds as though they are singing offstage? I feel as though I am sitting in the last row of the balcony. Some listeners of this recording obviously can get to the singers through the orchestra. I've tried and I can't. The more I listen to this recording with its ravishing orchestral sound, the more I become frustrated by the ""way back there"" placement of the singers. I'm looking for a great ""Butterfly"" and this misses the target. Still searching."
3,There are better Butterflies,"Mirella Freni is a lovely soprano, but she was not born to sing Cio-Cio-San nor Tosca, she was born to sing Mimi. My favourite Butterflies are Scotto/Barbirolli, Callas/Karajan and De Los Angeles/Gavazzeni all three recordings are on EMI (the last one now on testament) and all three are moving beyond words. Go for them!"
3,Where is the Oomph?,"Of all the complete recordings of Butterfly in my collection, this is the least interesting. Why? It lacks excitement. Act I especially is dull. Is it the slow conducting? Did it take weeks to record? Perhaps both. The beautiful voices of Freni and Pavarotti are there but I've only played the recording a few times and each time it disappoints. I can't express it's faults in musical terminology. In short, a beautiful work but sung without feeling."
3,Not the best Butterfly,"Forget about this. It is too slowly paced, and lacks the dynamics that Puccini intended with this opera.Pavarotti sounds somewhat ""non present"" and little involved(I have always been a big fan of him). Freni, though, sings beautifully.Instead, look for the 1954 recording with de Los Angeles, di Stefano and Gobbi.This is great! De Los Angles sings like an angel, and di Stefano is in excellent voice, and as engaged and passionate as only he can be."
3,Oddly Conducted but Beautifully Sung,"von Karajan must be doing something right on this recording because the singers give a very committed performance. None of the three leads ever sang their roles on stage although Freni did sing the last act at the Met during a gala.With all of the wonderful attributes of the singers, the presence and heavy hand of von Karajan might be a turn off to many. Turns me off within the first 20 minutes of act one. The conducting is extremely slow, overly detailed and precious, which is why this is the only BUTTERFLY on three CDs --- therefore the expense is something else that might cause someone to another recording.For fans of Freni, a less expensive alternative to this recording is the video that was made at the same time of the recording. She's rather stunning to see in the role despite the fussy direction of Ponnelle and the heavy handed conducting of von Karajan."
4,"Meraviglioso suono, grandi cantanti","Forse non pucciniano al 100%, ma il suono è meraviglioso, la direzione sicura e le voci sono grandi voci. Che volete di più?"
1,Something wrong with this MP3 Album!,"It's not complete.It cuts songs off, and the order is wrong.It almost sounds like what you get when you listen to the samples of songs from the download page.I agree that this is ONE FINE performance.But the MP3 version is the pits.Need to do better than this for a $27 opera, Amazon.Go with the CD version, folks!"
1,Terrible,"I ordered this hand warmer as well as the Platinum Catalyst Flameless Metal Hand Warmer. The Jon-E will not stay lit for very long. We've tried regular lighter fluid, Naptha, as well as the Jon-E fluid. When it is lit, it does get very hot but the smell is horrible. The Platinum Catalyst Warmer may not get as hot but it stays lit with any fluid and does not gas you out. Definitely would not recommend."
4,Long lasting real heat,This type of hand/body warmer is absolutely amazing!! I have the XL size and I use it a lot bc I am in construction an work outside a lot in the cold for long hours with not hear relief.. I used a temp gun on this and the heat is extremely HOT!! The temp of the metal itself is between 180-240 degrees and I had spikes up to 360 degrees and a average temp on the outside of the red cover of 130-155degrees.. The downside to all of this is the discontinued platinum catilyst on top that needs replacment every few years depending on usage.. The other downfall is the smell that it produces when on but outside its not even noticable.. This is by far the best handwarmer $ can buy. It's a bitch to start if your not experienced but the pros far outweigh the cons.if anyone knows where to buy the catilyst on top plz let me know..
1,I was expecting something that actually works?,"It simply doesn't work. If you follow the directions it lights easily and, as long as you don't try to use it, the almost overwhelming heat will continue for a couple hours. Once you put it in it's little bag (as the instructions direct you to do before you carry it) it goes out in a matter of minutes. Plus it smells really bad as it burns! This is one of the few items I have ever returned.I took my money and spent it on a Zippo Handy Warmer. Although it costs about 50% more I found it a MUCH better product because it actually works, uses less fuel, kept my hands warm for about 22 hours (6-8 hours a day for 3 days) without refueling, stinks less, plus it's thinner. Zippo Handy Warmer is about half as hot as the Jon-e (not a bad thing) and kept my hands warmer than 4 of those single use Hotties."
2,Hand warmer?,I followed the simple instructions and I could NOT keep the hand warmer lit if I placed it in a pocket or the included felt bag. If you simply hold it in your hand and keep it out of the felt bag then it works fine but that severly limits it usefulness.
5,Willie Wins in all areas...,"The story revolves around an universal expereince of young children; however, the way it is presented in Willie Wins and its main character being of Filipino descent makes it a well worth addition to any child's and teacher's (multi-cultural) library. The illustrations are vibrant. The expressions of the characters not only capitivate the audience with its detail but clearly conveys the feelings of the characters as well. Willie wins in all areas!"
4,Good tape overall,"This tape has lots of good exercizes, but not much useful information. There is one exercize that I consider dangerous, and should be avoided ""The sleeping lioness awakens"" END"
1,Broke within 10 minutes!,"I don't know if I got a defective hose or not, but the end cap of the one I received separated from the hose right after we installed it. The hose has a lip around it to keep the cap on, but a few minutes after we turned the pump back on the cap was off and water was pouring out. It would cost too much to return it so this is going straight into the trash can."
4,Poignant Story,Linda Horton gives us a poignant story of a young girl's search for love. It's painful for the reader to experience Macy's many disappointments. Often Linda's characters are cruel to our young heroine and we are thrilled when Macy's world begins to brighten. Linda's story reminds us of our human frailties and how a relationship with God can see us through the most difficult circumstances.
5,GREAT graphics....,"They say a picture is worth a thousand words and this book is full of amazing pictures showing the muscles. The pictures are composites made up of nude photos of human subjects (very tastefully and clinically rendered) with the applicable muscles painted in. The pictures are very well done and create the effect of looking directly into the body through the skin.I didn't find the text that helpful, but the quality and usefulness of the pictures make this very useful in conjuction with other books. I have been using it together with the Clair Davies' ""The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook"" (another book I highly recommend)."
3,Basic Clinical Massage Therapy Book Review,"Great pictures and some good information but rather a disappointment in that I was expecting something a bit more advanced in terms of information. This is basically a treatise on muscle location, with suggestions as to where to find trigger and tender points within the muscles. Oh well."
4,A Helpful Resource,"I have taught this novel to juniors for the past two years and have always felt that I was missing something. I ordered this unit in hopes of organizing myself and providing a clearer, simpler direction for my students, which is exactly what this CD-ROM aims to do. There are great resources for students, including study guides, contextual vocabulary lists, and review materials. Reading charts, tests, quizzes, and answer keys help me to cover all of the most important aspects of this complex novel without getting bogged down in details.My only criticism is that the daily lesson plans allow for a lot more in-class reading time than I generally consider appropriate for juniors. Some of the enrichment activities are so basic that they may be insulting to students if assigned. Fortunately, there are enough good ideas to offset these less than stellar ones.I would recommend this unit to anyone who needs help fine tuning or is teaching the book for the first time."
3,Index is worthless,"This is an OK book, bringing together a lot of the eCos documentation and some sage experience.However, the author did not spend very much time on the index, and this limits the usefullness of the book compared to the online documentation.For example, all of the eCos functions start with ""cyg_"", yet none of them appear in the index."
2,Real lack of effort in publishing,"To follow up on the printing. The copy I got was very, very bad. Pretty much every page has multiple printing errors making the book very difficult to read and in some places you need to understand the content already to make headway.The book used to ship with a CD. Now there's a sheet saying to go look at phptr.com for a download. I could not find the CD download, but I did find the book in pdf. At least the pdf can be read.Bad job Prentice Hall!"
4,Great for Windows Users...,"The book is a good introduction to eCos, even though much of the book's material can be found in the eCos documentation, available on line. The sample code and accompanying explanations give the reader a leg up on building useful software; unfortunately, all the code is in C, so C++ programmers may have to do a little more digging to get their code working correctly. Finally, while the walk-throughs of installation, configuration, and building are great, they all are based on Cygwin running under Windows. A corresponding section for Linux users would be a useful plus, especially since (from a perusal of the eCos mailing list), build errors under Linux are not uncommon.All things considered, however, the book is a great buy."

Im glad i will see him again on Oct 3 on RAW"
1,"No, you're the f*cking idiot","This is to the kid who hates cena and smackdown!. If there was no smackdown!, raw would be nothing now you dumbass. Cena, Big Show, Angle,rvd have gone from sd! to raw and in the past The Rock, HHH, Hogan.....Does raw have any wrestlers such as rey and eddie??No. But of course you got the very young, fast and high flyer who is non other than Hogan. I liked him in the old days but now he realy needs to retire. Don't say you got wrestlers like Rock and Stone Cold, because we both know the're not wrestling anymore.If you like you guys like your GM, then why the hell do you boo him??And Why the hell do you cheer John Cena, when everyday I look on the net you're all saying that he sucks??The only reason smackdown! sucked for a while was because of that lowlife piece of sh*t JBL when he was wwe champ for 9 months and still he main events all sd! ppvs. Just watch sd! this week and then talk bullsh*t.

3,Does not use standard size staples,"I only have standard sized staples. I thought this stapler would take standard size staples. I had to order the smaller arrow J21 staples. Looking back and reading the description it says the staples it would take, but regular folks like me would not know what J21 staples are. All the staplers I bought before took regular size staples. I suggest to revise the description to warn customers that this stapler does not take regular size staples. I also suggest to include in the package a small box of the staples it would take. A stapler without staples is useless needless to say.Received the J21 staples unfortunately they were too big for this stapler. I found a stapler made of metal in a kit form with case and staples here in Amazon, Stanley TR45K. Unfortunately I already bought the Stanley stapler at Ace Hardware and I also have to buy the staples."
4,I've owned 3 of these,There are so handy because they're alot smaller and lightweight than most other staple guns that don't require power. I lost my first one so I decided to buy 2 more for work. They are hard to find in retail stores.
1,hard to use,This stapler is hard to use. It also said it can use standard staples but I yet to see how. It is impossible to put in standard staples and the desktop feature is just a cheap plastic base. Staples one touch staplers are much better.
2,London Map by Borch,We bought a couple of different maps when preparing for a European trip last year. We found this map to be cumbersome and unhelpful. The maps in the travel guides met our needs as tourists who saw London by foot and Tube.
5,Lessons from a Venetian Vinedresser,"Lessons from a Venetian Vinedresser is Biblical in its premise, pragmatic in its purpose and motivational in its approach. This book is splendid in every way. Robert Scott Stiner's book is well conceived and artfully executed. Christians everywhere should read, mark, learn and practice its truths. I heartily recommend it.Jay Hartranft D. MinChaplainLieutenant Col.United States Army"
1,BEWARE; author is a scam artist...,"I could not even get through the first chapter despite repeated effort and vigilant prayer.... I have since had the misfortune of a lengthy relationship with the man that claims to be this author (he is pictured in the books) and know him to be predator, a liar, a thief and a disgrace to the Christian faith. His ""ministry"" has damaged the walk of many Christians and brought shame upon the Christian community. Please pray for him but DO NOT support his works."
2,Out of the Box the Wireless doesn't work,"I purchased this system because of the wireless capabilities, well right out of the box the wireless tower does not work. Not a good start! I will be calling support today. To be continued.Well strike two and I'm done. I sent the first one back because the wireless tower did not work right out of the box. They sent me another one, and guess what? It didn't work either. When I talked to Samsung support they sounded as if this was happening a lot? I think they need to work the bugs out before they ship the product out."
2,The book is inaccurate about AutoCad LT's abilities.,"I found ""AutoCAD LT 97 for Windows 95/NT"" to not point out the real potentials and had some statements that it could not do things that it could do very well. In reading the book I felt the author was playing down the importance of AutoCAD LT 97 and its abilities. The book did have some good material to help out a beginner."
1,Not helpful on any topic. Below basic.,Well below the manufacturer's manual. Not worth spending time or money
2,Informative,"This book is okay. If your one of those people who enjoys instruction manuals, then you'll love this informative book. While supposedly for kids, this book is more for adults. Kids will be bored by the subject matter, but for anyone with a hunger for space books, this is one."
1,informative but bland,"For good reason, no one really cares about Sojourner. I don't know why there is a book on it. While maybe informative, my kids did not like this book. If you want your kid to get interested in the space program, don't show them this book. I recommend any other space book out there. This is not a fun book to read."
2,Useless.,"The rack is made of incredibly thin wire. It was bent out of the box, but I could reshape it very easily with my fingers.There are four feet made of bent wire that can hardly support its own weight on the counter. Even the lightest of pastries make it sag. You can forget about cooling a cake or a loaf of bread.The only way to us it is to place it atop a different, stronger rack, perhaps if the other one has a grate that's too large. In my kitchen, it's useless."
1,Poor quality home-style video production,"Remarkably this ""home-style"" video is being packaged and sold as a serious truth about the Philadelphia Experiment. Now when I say home-style video, that's exactly what I mean. The product that I received was recorded on two ""off the shelf"" 50 cent DVD's (not a good start). I don't know what cheap DVD menu editing software program was used but my eight-year-old daughter could design something more professional with a box of crayons! Frankly, its programs like these that will never give a serious subject quality airtime. If the original intention was as an historic occasion for the participating cast (or mates), fine...leave it at that. If it was intended as a viable commercial concern (and I don't think it was), at least hire some quality editing services and not just transfer a poor quality video (& sound) to a 50-cent DVD. I was so disappointed with the quality production that I did not view the entire DVD and have returned the product to AMAZON."
1,boring and worthless,I have never seen a more cheaply made video in all my life.. Seriously it is a bunch of men sitting around a living room just talking for 3 hours! Save your money!
5,Hours of Stunning Information,"I have never seen anything like this! It was the most informative presentation I have ever seen and explains so much about what most people do not understand when it comes to the possibility of time travel, remote viewing, UFOs, invisibility projects and the like. This DVD set is an education and it's an entertaining one. I could not be more satisfied!"
5,We love our Goldendoodle DR sign!,"We have our sign at the end or our driveway closest to the road, and use it as a landmark when giving people directions to our home! The sign is good quality and worth the money."
3,3 stars,"*** Religion has more questions associated with it than almost anything, and many of those questions are common to the majority of people. The authors of the Knowing series of books invited their readers to send their queries to them, and have chosen the most prevalent ones to answer in book form. The questions and answers run the gamut from simplistic to complex, and surely in there somewhere is at least one that you will think ""I've always wondered"" in relation to . This is a handy reference for a Christian who has a friend with a lot of questions or someone newly exploring Christianity. ***Amanda Killgore"
4,Great Stuff,"A great look at one of music's major ""soul"" R & B bands.Audio quality is not the best but still good enoughto appreciate the talent of each musician.I was finally able to tell who was playing which part, Eric or Cornell Richard Tee is amazing."
5,Classic Stuff,"This group consisted of some of the finest New York session men, who played on a multitude of recordings - and perhaps most famously were the core of Paul Simon's backing band in the mid 70s to 80s. This set as the title shows is live at Montreux in 1976.The line-up is:Steve Gadd - DrumsGordon Edwards - BassRichard Tee - KeyboardsCornell Dupree - GuitarEric Gale - GuitarSadly Richard tee and Eric Gale are no longer with us. However this DVD reminds you of their great talent. These guys were masters of the groove. Anybody who knows about Steve Gadd will know that this makes them the perfect band for him. They lock into the groove, and so will you!There is some fabulous Gospel Piano playing from Richard Tee, one drum solo from Steve Gadd and a guest singer does appear. In case you didn't realise this is essentially an instrumental band. However when you see what they do with Stevie Wonder's ""Signed Sealed Delivered I'm Yours"" you'll wonder why anybody needs singers!"
2,Wish I hand't bought it,"Poorly written, very low quality paper, and the execution of the ideas is really low grade. The concept is nice, the execution mediocre."
3,This book has some good points but a lot of flaws,"Anybody who has seen the latest edition, knows it's got the theory there, and of all the editions, it was more clearly written than in any of the other ones, however the examples are crap and there are quite a few typographical errors. i guess if they ever proof read their book and make a next edition, it'll get another star from me, and also another thing they did in the book, which is probably not the best of ideas, is in their examples quite often towards the beginning having secondary functioning chords there before they're even introduced in the book. but with the errors in the text it still is probably one of the best in print. i don't think too many people would buy this book for independant studies, so there will be a teacher there to clear the confusion and hopefully spot the errors for the students."
4,Too Many Mistakes to get a 5,Not only are there too many mistakes to give them a 5 But they don't have a corrections page on there web site. We all make mistakes but to charge over $80 and not have a corrections page is criminal.Still it is the best music theory - a correction page would give them a 5 in my opinion.Paul Stapp
3,Good book,Book covers a lot of music theory. Arrived quickly but without the CD that was supposed to come with it. This was not listed in the seller's claim- disappointed.
5,"""Tonal Harmony - An excellent Work""",The book provides a very systematic approach towards various elements of music in a standard format. Simply a great help towrads understanding of music. I think once I complete my reading I would be a better musician...
2,Could Be Better,"The mistakes limit this publication from being good. Also, the book's language makes simple things, such as harmonic progressiona and non-chord tones, seem much harder to construct and understand than they actually are."
3,the errors edition,"Kostka and Payne did a great job with their theory, although there are some disputes. The problem with this edition is the vast amounts of errors in it's pages. Because of the rush to publish it, even elementary students can point out the errors in both textbook and workbook."
3,Academic but not useful,"I've been using this text at two colleges in Southern California. Almost across the board, students have trouble understanding the text. Granted it is not as bad as the latest Piston/DeVoto ""Harmony"" abomination, but that's a different topic. I'll be switching to Robert Gauldin's wonderful harmony text ""Harmonic Practice in Tonal Music"" as soon I get the go ahead from my dept chairs."
5,Above and Beyond,"I ordered this textbook in a hurry, and was disappointed to realize that it could take so long to arrive-after my class using this book would start. However, I received it a week before my class started, and the book is in such good condition it amazed me. I wasn't expecting much but I was just utterly surprised by this! This textbook had such few markings, and the actual few ones that were penciled in were actually helpful for reference. I would definitely order again from this seller! ^^"
1,tonal harmony,this is not a good book for musicians who are trained by ear or someone who hasnt been in music for a long time. it doesnt explain the information in some chapters you have to have a teacher to understand it completely and if you dont have a good teacher youll be in a bad position like i was. i play the piano guitar and i sing and i had trouble with this book the first 5 chapters are not that bad but once you get to the 6 and 7th chapter youre in deep do do if your teacher just trys to fly through as though youre suppose to be a expert. half of my class barely passed for one we had a teacher who knew the information but didnt know how to teach itsecond the book doesnt explain the information i wouldnt recommend this booki hate this book with a passion i have to use this book for 4 semester what a drag
2,Very Dry....,"(Note: I've been using this book for independent study, and thus I'm not comparing it to other institutionalized texts). A few reviewers have mentioned that this is a ""college text"". As a college graduate, I know from experience that ""college text"" is a euphemism that professors use to describe a boring, poorly written text. Although the information is not presented optimally, it's all there, and you can still learn a great deal from this text (especially if you have a teacher to call upon for clarifications). Each section of every chapter provides a set of exercises, but the authors don't offer many ideas for creative applications, and they don't even feel the need to explain the importance of the information they're presenting or tell you how to use the material to make yourself a better musician. If you have a good teacher, this text isn't really worth complaining about, but if you're on your own, I'd suggest going elsewhere."
4,MUSIC CLASS,"This textbook has come in quite handy in studying music theory. I'm glad to finally have my own copy and for such a low price! If you have theory classes, no matter what year you are in school, I highly recommend this book. The illustrations and terms list at the end of each chapter make it extremely helpful for exams! A great buy!"
3,Not what I expected,"Definately not what I expected. Lots of poignant questions, but not much in the way of thoughtful answers. They asked the cast and crew of The Passion questions about their religious beliefs. Do you believe in God? Do you believe in Heaven? Do you believe in miracles? And many more such questions. Many answers were brief or vague or unrelated to the question at hand. However, there were a few thoughtful answers worth listening to. Much of the film was artsy filming, a lone dog wandering around in a scenic area, sunsets, that sort of thing. Overall, I have to say I didn't get much from it, although someone else might. I doubt if I would watch it more than once."
2,Acrylic Deluxe 6-drawer Jewelery Chest,"This product looked good, but it didn't work. When I received it, two of the six drawers would not open. I returned it for a refund."
4,very nice!,Love it! I've been looking for a way to display my jewelry so I can see what I have without pullineg everything out. This does the job perfectly!
4,Satisfied,"Very nice looking. Only 1 complaint, same as some others the drawers tend to stick. I did switch them around and it seems to be working fine."
3,Super Atragon,"Super Atragon comes in two installments Super Atragon and Super Atragon II. This is really a set of OAVs. The story has a lot of the same elements as the 1960's live action version. Super Atragon II fills in most of the blanks that volume I left open although many feel on the whole there's too much action and not enough character development. While this isn't hard science fiction it does have some valid science and if accepted as an update to the 60's release it's enjoyable as action SciFi. Just don't epect something of ""Planetes's"" caliber. Super Atragon II is released by ADV films."
2,2 stars for a reason,"If you're into sci-fi drama, I wouldn't recommend this dvd. I bought this thinking maybe it'll be a good addition to my Robotech, Macross, and Yamato sets. The story is really unfinished, too many loop holes in it, and the science is probably more art than science.They really don't go deep into the characters and how the enemy nor the main characters got into this battle or war. For some reason, I am believing that they ran out of budget and never finished this movie. If you're looking for a good sci-fi, then don't buy this DVD. Actually don't buy this DVD period. I watched it once, and never touched it since."
1,"Good Tech, Bad Writing","Credit is due for the descriptions and lore of the American torpedo and the operations of the P-3 Orion and the PBY Catalina, one of the unsung mechanical heroes of WW II. Credit is also due for the insights into the hearts and minds of the terrorist enemies of the United States that will not be found elsewhere. The story surrounding them is weak. The writing is the worst I have ever seen in a book,the worst. So poor is the structure of sentence after sentence after sentence and so clumsy is the vocabulary, that one would almost suspect that words and phrases were dropped during a bad digital scan of a manuscript. A hard read. I finished it only because I am ex-Navy and a military tech enthusiast. Others would not have the patience."
4,Slow starter.,A bit slow at first as well as convaluted yet the final 1/4 of the story proved to be the high suspense of Dan Brown. Glad I stuck with the story to it's conclusion. Being a retired submarine Sonar Tech made it all very believeable!
4,Outstanding Early CD Recording,"This recording was made in the early days of CD's and consumer digital electronics. At that time it was the finest recording of Holst's ""The Planets"" available. Although technology has changed and orchestras are more atuned to the demands of the technology, this recording is still masterful. Relative to today's recordings it gets 4 stars, but the performance rates 5 stars."
3,A lot of info lacking a little extra,"This book is actually quite entertaining to read. It was well written and had tons of interesting information...however, what I truly expected in a book like this was pictures, and there weren't a whole lot of them. Half the time the images were drawings, and a good portion of them were described as ""fakes."" I was disappointed because the book is strictly about unexplained physical phenomena, but there are hardly any photographs in the book to add to the entertainment value."
3,Unexplained - explained!,A very informative book about subjects not always widely publised.Interesting and useful for all those things that go bump in the night.End of the day a good thought provoking read.
5,Amazing book,"I have the first edition of Unexplained, then, when I learned about this new edition I had to purchased it!This is a very improved book. More information, more pictures, more mystery.Unexplained is quite successful on Strange Phenomena subject, at least for me!"
4,The Best Possible Book of Its Type,"Jerome Clark is not a crackpot. As a figure in the field of Ufology and Cryptozoology, one understands that such a statement is actually a complement.This book sums up Clark's approach to unexplained phenomena. Sifting through all kinds of reports, from the fantastic - Merefolk, the Goblin Universe and Sky Serpents, to the more mundane - Coloured Rains and Entombed Animals, the author brings a critical eye to everything.For instance, he discredits reports from the Bermuda Triangle, and refrains from delving into paranormal matters, claiming that they're 'outside the scope of this book.'Beyond the grounded approach and methodology, readers will find a treasure trove of spellbinding tales in this volume, even if most of them have no grounding in fact."
3,Repetitive and strange but worth buying,"Well, I had this game when I was very little. It was OK, but I found that I had to work out a lot of things the game should've told me. Also, I found it distracting that whenever I left the game running, a bit of music would play and Madeline would use a yo-yo or something. It was really annoying and it gave me a shock if the rest of the house was silent.Also, whenever leaving the game, it would show Madeline's house at night and the narrator would talk. I, for some reason, found this incredibly creepy and I have had nightmares about it THREE times! But don't fault the game for that, I was probably just an over-sensitive child at the time.The only problem with the game is that it has one storyline. Once it is played for the first time, it is very similar each time, and everything happens in the same way. I still recommend the game if this does not bother you. If you can get it cheap, it's worth buying, but there are better games out there."
4,"Preaty good, but Madeline's Cristmas in Texes is SILLY!!!!!","This game is fun, but there are some complantes. First of all,the game is the same EVERY TIME YOU PLAY EXECT THE POSTCARDS! What I mean by that is the postcards are different every time, but that's only the decorations. It's educational, that's for sure. It taught me about how every countrie has different money(Madeline must trade her money for the native money every place she vists). It also made me ask if Istanble was the capitle of Turkey(It was). I too, am disapointed that this is the only game of it's kind(the only Madeline adveture game), but I don't think they'll ever make a Madeline Cristmas in Texes but they DID go to New York on the show and they use a car or airplane in almost every show. Over all, this game is fun, but I recomend don't buy it unless you have a young child.(Also, what was the the point in Madeline just standing around when sunndenly a bunch of balls bounce around the corrner?) ~Russian Blue Witch"
4,Another Esoteric French Film,"I bough this movie on a recommendation from a friend. It did not disappoint. Though different from what I had initially imagined, this film is beautiful. The cast and the cinematography are phenomenal. The French have a different approach to film making than Americans. It's much cleaner and rawer. There isn't a blaring soundtrack at every moment to tell the viewer how they should be feeling. I would definitely recommend this film about nascent adolescent love."
2,Short review,"I found this a boring film. There was no new insight to the world of the adolescent. If you are a big fan of high school synchronized swimming teams, you may well enjoy the film."
3,Interesting,This movie was interesting. Kind of weird but loved it. The best friend was odd but all in all it was a good movie.
3,The lesser version of Show Me Love,"The Bottom Line:Many aspects of Water Lilies work on their own and someone unfamiliar with Moodyson's wonderful 1998 film Show Me Love will probably be reasonably pleased, but Water Lilies follows the beats of the latter film so closely it's impossible not to compare them and equally impossible not to notice which is the better film; if you're looking for an honest, sweet, and nuanced look at a relationship between two young girls then first check out Show Me Love, then maybe watch Water Lilies later.3/4"
2,Best for Man Haters,"This is a very enjoyable movie, especially if you hate men including young boys. Though the performances are very good and the girls lovely and very appealing, the plot is clearly contrived to degrade men, especially very young boys. They are incapable of love or intimate communication, only want sex and always hurt the girls they persue, both physcially and emotionally. The message is clearly stated -- the only true love is lesbian love. Still it's a well made watchable movie. So how to rate it. I gave it two stars instead of one because it was enjoyable despite is obvious malicious intent. To paraphrase Gibbon --""The only defect in this pleasing composition (movie, in this case) was its want of truth and common sence."""
1,I HATE LASERDISK,THIS IS the worst part of my life. I saved up all my pocket change to buy what i thought was a DVD of STAR WARS. Instead its a 20 inch wide disk. You would have a better time mashing up a vhs and putting it in a dvd player. I smashed this in my backyard when i was bored one summer day. That was the most fun i got out of this retarted piece of garbage.
5,OUTSTANDING!,"I've been looking for a book like this for sometime. BOTH sides of the issues which Christians are divided over are explained. Not only are the issues explained fairly, but Erwin Lutzer brings in the giants to defend each position; no straw men here. The Martin Luther-vs-Erasmus section over Free Will is really good. Another thing which I like is that the author lets you know his positions on the issues. This allows the reader to decide if he is being fair to the other view."
4,"Good and Scriptural, but not Objective","While I believe that Erwin Lutzer has written an outstanding book and I agree with him on almost every point (infant baptism being the huge exception), I do find a slight quibble in that the book is advertised as presenting an objective opinion, which it does not. However, I will hasten to point out that Lutzer is backed up by Scripture is his statements on every single point, which makes up for most of this and brings my rating of the book up to 4 stars. I'd give it a full 5 if he was more straightforward in the fact that he was in fact arguing for specific positions (including Calvinism, which is perfectly Biblical--don't get me wrong, but he specifically says at one point that he's not trying to convince the reader to become a Calvinist when in fact I think he really is).It's an excellent read, and Lutzer's thesis is certinaly important--we cannot sacrifice essential doctrines for the sake of unity. The former is more important."
4,"A clear, simple statement of Biblical doctrine vs Non-Biblical inventions","Dr. Lutzer does a good job of providing a history of the origin of the doctrine. Sometimes I wish his ""rebutal"" was more stongely stated, but it is still better than a lot of younger pastors are willing to state.Definitely a good read."
5,Great book on doctrines of different churches,I think that this book was well written and I learned a lot about different churches doctrine. Easy and fast read. Highly recommended. You can't go wrong with Erwin Lutzer.
3,Pretty Basic Stuff,"These doctrines have have been examined, reviewed, and expounded upon many times by many writers in the past. Most concentrate more on scriptural evidence than Lutzer. The writer delves into much of the historical backgrounds of denominations and the reasons that they formulate for believing what they say and do; however, most of this material can easily be obtained from standard reference books relating to church orthodoxy and doctrine. There is really nothing new or compelling in Lutzer's analysis of differences. For a student or new believer, this is a good 101 introduction and, as the summary states on the back cover,"" It is a revisit in a non-combative way to those issues that divide the Christian community."
1,Lutzer doesn't know what he's talking about,"The title of this book suggests that it is a careful analysis of the different doctrines dividing the various branches of Christianity. In fact, much of the book is a ham-handed critique of Catholic beliefs. The author is, to judge from this book, rather unqualified for this task. Nearly every time he presents the Catholic position, he either presents a caricature or an untruth. Whether this is out of malice, sloppiness, or ignorance I don't know. Anyone looking to understand the distinctions between different strands of Christianity would do much better to look elsewhere.If you're looking for something from a Catholic perspective, I'd recommend Peter Kreeft. For a general, classic perspective on Christian faith in general, read ""Mere Christianity"" by C.S. Lewis."
3,Not impressed!!!!!,"Not too happy with this item,for the price I this it too small and flimsy.It seemed much larger on the picture.j"
2,Dimensions Question,"What are the dimensions of this organizer? Can the drawer hold eye glasses for storage? Need the height, width, depth etc...."
4,Versatile storage unit,"I just purchased this item and although I'm not happy to see the price has dropped $30, I am very happy with the product. It is sturdy and well made high quality acrylic. It stores a variety of items and is pretty on a vanity or dresser. I use it for makeup storage and a smaller 6-drawer for costume jewelry. A lot of people say this is the unit Kim K uses, but I think she has a similar but larger storage unit that retails around $300-$400. Be aware that the drawers are very shallow in this one and won't hold large palettes. It's great for single eye shadows and blushes. There are more and less expensive alternatives out there if you search hard enough."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with this Chest the drawer's when I open them they come out completely and it is very very small I was not able to use it as a cosmetic organizer.
4,Gifted lyricist finding his voice,"David Barton is an independent-minded music critic, which makes it all the more brave of him to stick out his neck as a singer-songwriter. The other reviewers favor the straight-ahead rock anthems on this CD; I prefer the ballads, which do a better job of showcasing Barton's distinctive talents: warm, expressive singing (and playing) and (most of all) lyrics that are smart without being smart-ass, witty without being precious. He has the true songwriter's gift of taking everyday patterns of speech and giving them a fresh new twist."
2,Read the quantity included before purchase,I was under the impression this was a complete set (4) for the vehicle. Review the details before purchase. The 2 rear vent visors were good quality when received but only half of the set did me no good.
4,wistful.,A good band with a lead singer capable of leading you elsewhere. A snatch of new wave and a new feeling of something not yet done make this current. Buy it.
4,Fine performances of a fine work,"The Devil's Wall is Smetana's last completed opera. The plot is rather complicated, so suffice to say it is a comic-romantic drama with, despite some rather dull and workmanlike passages, several interesting and beautiful parts - especially those given to the Lord of Rosenberg as sung, wonderfully, by Vaclav Bednar.In fact, most of the roles are filled by very able singers - Milada Subrtova is fine as Hedvika and both Libuse Domaninska and Ivo Zidek deliver well-sung roles as well. I am less sure about Antonin Votava, but that may be in part because his role of Michalek contains less striking music. Chalabala's conducting is good as always, and despite being almost 50 years old, the sound is very good - far better than, say, on the later Brandenburgers in Bohemia set under Tichy.All in all this is a very recommendable recording of what is perhaps not Smetana's best opera, but a very worthwhile one nonetheless."
1,Flimsy and brittle,Thin hard plastic cracked while installing. Ended up eplacing it with a metal pan. I should have gone metal to begin with.
2,terrible.,"blah.. i'll make this review snappy. i don't care what people say, this game sucks, and it's obviously made for kids only. the idea of using a paintbrush in the game is supposedly ""innovative."" yet not fun or interesting. sure, whatever."
5,Really awesome game!,"This game might look childish at first, but as you play it, it becomes more and more difficult... Really Awesome designs.. Cool game, hours of fun~"
5,I loved this game.,"a lot of the games you can get now are just fighting games. If you like ones where you have to find hidden treasures and figure things out, this is for you. It is more of a Zelda type game; which are getting harder and harder to find. If you like Zelda, I think you'll like this."
4,Great Attention grabber,"It really keeps ur attention and holds ur focus. Its unique and stylish gameplay makes it a worth while purchase. No other game gives the player such a interaction with the game. Using a brush to create wind, fire, sun, and water sounds horrible but is extremely fun. I highly recommend this game."
5,Not Zelda!,Ok well i've read all the reviews on Okami and you all say its like zelda well its not! You play as a freaking wolf not as a stupid little kid with pointy ears. Overall the game is awsome and I've almost beaten it. It's cool being able to use a brush and that stuff. So overall I love this game and its not like zelda you dorks!
4,Great Game with a slow start,"The only problem that I have with the game is the very long introduction which you cannot skip past. I love the game (being an adult) but, my nephew ""bailed"" and turned on a star wars game. Other than that, it's a great game and very interesting. The graphics are really great and simulate a watercolor painting. Pretty slick!"
4,That Brush is Frustrating!,"That's the only reason why I didn't pick 5's for both. I didn't buy this through Amazon, I bought it in a game store. Otherwise, the graphics are beautiful, the music is good, & there's lots to do so the game isn't going to be a short one. But there aren't enough save points in the game, the voices can start to bother you(especially when you have to keep doing a part repetitively because the brush won't work for you & if they have a long part you can't skip it)& the brush is very picky, but when you can't use it you do miss it. I'm sure once I finish it, that it'll be played over & over again though. It is very enjoyable even though certain parts of it have made me curse at it. I'm only 50 hours into it, so I'm sure there''s more cursing to come."
5,a must have for ps2,"i'm a guy of few words so i'll just set it straight... this game has a solid storyline, innovative gameplay, stunning artistic graphics, content fit for all ages... if you dare call yourself a gamer, you know this title is a must."
4,"Beautiful, deep, and frustrating.","This game is a blast, the graphic style is like almost nothing I've ever seen before, but it is by no means perfect. The stop-start style of battles is distracting, and the fake voices make the game almost so annoying to be unplayable. Other than that, its deep, gorgeous, and etheral, I just would have liked the option to turn those damned blurbings off."
4,Okami works,Okami is challenging but not too frustrating. It has lots of levels so it will entertain for a long time.
5,RPG fun,For RPG's this game is different because you are a wolf the other RPG's that I play you are people and my fav.(dragon). This is right up there with the dragon....
4,Dream Keeper,"A wonderfully imaginative novel incorporating an acute insight into the value of myth and mystery in our historical and cultural lives. Ruvinsky has well trained story telling skills from his life as a screenwriter, and for those so inclined, a sweet sense of the romantic. Who knows where this stuff comes from, but it is very unique and swell read."
4,Excellent value bike,"I bought this bike two weeks ago for my wife. The bike arrived well packed with no problems. The assembly took about 10 minutes. I have no bicycle assembly or tune up experience whatsoever. The bike rode fine and the only complaint that I have so far is that the shifters are a bit imprecise. Nothing terrible, but not as nice on my much more expensive Bianchi bike. I don't know if a tune would help - did not try, as the bike is used for very occasional ride here and there as is fine as is.I think it is an excellent bike for the money."
2,Problems with delivery and assembly of MGX,"We received the Mongoose MGX today and have had significant problems. Its too early to review the actual bike performance but....the bike was delivered with the box open and missing parts. The front strut had significant scratches and the tools that were supposed to be included weren't. What's more, the assembly directions weren't easy to understand and the front break still isn't working as well as I'd like after much tuning (maybe 2 hours of assembly time so far). The front tire is bent a little so that one section of the tire will rub on the brake.I have to conclude that purchases from Amazon should not include anything that needs significant assembly and am very close to returning the bike."
2,"Great all-around bike, some parts missing.","This bike was a gift. On Christmas, we assembled the bike. The two mounting anchoring bolts for the brakes were missing. I called Pacific Cycle and they shipped the brake parts promptly. If someone didn't know any better, they could have sustained injury if tring to ride this bike. They need to inspect before shipping!"
3,Good bike,"It's a beautiful bike and great quality. I just got mine today and I love it. I just have to get used to riding it, it's been 20 years since I've ridden a bike but I'm sure I'll get used to it with this one."
4,for digestive issues,I have been taking these capsules for three weeks now and do notice a difference in my digestive health. I take them in the morning with my other vitamins and supplements. It has helped to decrease intestinal distress.
2,do not waste your money,Do not waste you money. Totally dissapointed. I expected some form of relief naturally. Yet the only thing experienced was burping. Don't waste your money.
2,you will need magnifying glasses in the car!,"Nice map, but the print is way too small to be usable for me. You need a magnifying glass to see street names. I thought this map was a fold out one but it is only 8.5"" tall that accordians out. There are better ones available. I am a firm believer that in getting to know a new city one should have a laminated map that can be easily carried. Even though I have a good GPS, I find that having a large pictoral snapshot is very helpful."
5,"New parent, old vegan.","Good book for new parents. Answered the questions we had about what do we say to other parents? What do we do about school? It was more of a book for comfort than it was for information, but still worth owning."
3,Vegan Book,"This book is good but ONLY for very early beginners. Most of the information, for me, was common sense and I have only been a vegan for 3 months."
3,best for new vegans only,"As a vefan for the past 10 years, this book was a disappointment. I give 3 stars because I am still happy someone wrote a book about vegan children. I am a vegan homeschool mom with 4 kids, this book is for kids in the public school system. My kids live in a vegan world! I would suggest Dr.Klaper's book ""Pregnancy, Children and the Vegan Diet""."
3,Okay....,"This book is okay. It's not the best book I've come across but it's okay and is worth reading. Most info is very basic and for someone new to veganism, a lot of common sense."
4,Some great bluegrass and a little filler,"Another solid offering from Ricky and the boys. As usual, several cuts (Shady Grove, The Old Home, Road to Spencer, and Mother's Only Sleeping) are pure gold and worth the price of the CD. Some of the more ""contemporary"" cuts (e.g. Halfway Home Cafe) were a little too pop for my tastes, but I think Ricky's just trying to add a little variety to the mix and I appreciate that. All in all this is another outstanding CD by one of the world's greatest bluegrass bands and you should absolutely buy it if you have any interest in this type of music. Saw Ricky last summer in Austin and he and Kentucky Thunder just tore the place up."
5,Perfectly bluegrass,"Put the chitlins on, Pa. Butter up the cornbread, I'm coming home for supper. Tell that boy Ricky to dust off his mandolin. Mercy, it's pure stuff."
1,This is hot stuff!,"Usually, when I purchase music, I'll tape off my favorite 4 or 5 cuts and forget about the rest of the songs. Not so on this album...there's not a cull in the bunch. The musicians in this band are such that even if you don't like bluegrass, after listening to these boys pick, you will at the very least have to admire their musicianship. I happen to play myself, and I'm pretty much a traditionalist, but there's enough of hard-drivin', down-home 'grass on this one to please anyone. If you're thinking of buying this one, in my opinion, you can't go wrong. Try it...you'll like it!"
4,Honest and moving stories about friendships among women,The authors intersperse interviews with women who talk about their friendships with other women with personal stories. A book that reminds us of the value of friendship
3,Great insight,The stories in the book are true testimonies to the fact that friendship has to be base d on giving and not only receiving. You have to be willing to be available for the hard times and not just the good moments.
3,wrong color for me too,"I purchased this for a friend directly from her baby registry. She wanted the soleo, but received the revi black. I called Amazon, and it took me awhile to explain it, but they agreed to ship her another one today as long as she sends the first one back. hopefully, she will get the one she wants this time, but if this happens to you, DO NOT let them tell you you need to return it for a refund first because it is obviously their mistake. Even more reason - this item has gone up almost $20 since I placed the original order less than a week ago."
3,Wrong color,"I had to return this item because I received the wrong color.I bought a Stroller in Soleo and needed the car seat in Soleo also. However, the product available in amazon as soleo say Toffee in the description and I received the item is toffee.I contacted several vendors directly and they have the item available in Soleo. However, the item posted in amazon says toffee and I do not have any way to order the soleo one.I do not want to order directly from the vendor, and I would like amazon to solve the problem and offer the item in soleo."
2,Maxim's CD,The CD content was awful and not what I expected. There was a lot of speaking and not a lot of music. It sounds like music on an elevator and repeats for like 7 minutes and then on the next track too. Ick.
3,"First CD Good, Second CD Average","For the number of songs in this 2-CD set (and the price) I found it a major disappointment. Starts with a pretentious opening of girls on the street getting a taxi, speaking French in an English accent. But the following tracks are exceptional - Cuban and other Latin stuff from the mid-20th Century. Except, they aren't mixed with electronica (they don't need it of course). It's these selections that make the album. There are also a couple of selections with Gypsy Kings-style guitar mixed with a soft techno beat and other effects that are passable. After that, the mixes and club music (esp. on the 2nd CD) sound average and tired. If you're looking for music for a dance number, you might find something on this. They tend toward a 70's-summer-resort-disco style which sometimes has just the right cheesiness to be good, other times becomes a yawn. For lite club music, far better stuff can be found in Costes and other albums of that ilk (for my money anyway!)."
5,Wonderful,"If you're interested in robot motion planning, this book is it! It provides incomparable detailed coverage of the major methods for motion planning and their theory, and could serve as a great geometrical perspective to planning in general. It's not a casual read, however and is meant for a specialist audience with a liking for theory. No professional roboticist should be without it."
1,Missleading,"I find the title of this CD completely missleading. I was expecting a GUIDE to the orchestra being a complete ignorant, but there is no guidance at all. I was expecting Benjamin Britten to comment the instruments that were playing but there is nothing like that. All you hear is beautifull music."
4,I eat Viking Metal for breakfast!!!!,"I eat Viking Metal for breakfast!! That's right, I pour sugar on it & eat it like most mortals eat their cereal!! Falkenbach demands your stinkin' attention!! So, put down your bowl of Fruit Loops and listen!! This concludes the Falkenbach album review...Don't make me come back here...!!"
4,Learned some sexy moves,"Bought this DVD so I could surprise my fiance on our wedding night. I should have probably gotten the DVD that precedes this ( I didn't know there was one when I bought it). But even so, she is very good at explaining how to do certain moves and the camera angles are great so you can see the way it will look from different view points. My only gripe is that sometimes she goes through a move too quickly. I have to use the ""repeat chapter"" feature on my DVD player so that I can practice the move until it looks right. But overall a good buy and I feel like he will be impressed."
1,miss-representation,"Since I can find no reference to Asimov in the editing, article writing or introduction credits and would suggest that the book is being miss-represented as being by Isaac Asimov."
4,Great singing,"If this is Joan Sutherland way past her prime, I can't imagine how great she must have been IN her prime. I personally enjoy all the singers in this cd."
3,Mixed truimph!,"If you are a fan of Pavorotti and Horne, buy this CD. But if you are a fan of Dame Joan, you will be very disappointed. Sutherland is already way past her prime years of 1956-1976. Her wide vibrato is and pitch problems are particularly troublesome."
5,Very Good Documentary,This is an excellent documentary. I just finished watching it and I must say that I learned quite a bit. It tells various facts about the 12 Apostles and it also gives archaeological evidence that helps to confirm the Truth of the Gospel. The graphics are very good and the audio is also very good as well. I strongly recommend this to anyone interested in learning about the 12 Apostles. The back of the DVD case says that running time is approximately 120 minutes but it only ran for about 60 minutes so I am assuming the time given on the back of the case is an error.
5,True Music,"Simply put, you haven't lived musically until you've heard Beth Hart. She has the ability to stroke your emotions like very few others can with her powerful and intense voice. Her words - her sound and voice - have meaning. I bought Screamin' for Christmas a few years back (a present to myself, hehe) and have since picked up Immortal and both are by far my favourite CD's. Before I go to university next year, I'm going to buy them both again just so that I can have new copies. ^_^"
4,Works somewhat good.,I purchased this fro a new bike because aluminum bottle holders make black marks on my water bottles. It works better than aluminum . The only negative is that this type of holder doesn't always keep the bottle secure on RR tracks or other bumps in the road.
4,Works as Promised,Needed a waterbottle cage for my wife's new bike. It was easy to install. Matches her bike. Works as promised. No problems. Her other bike had a plastic cage and she likes this one better. For me the price was right and my wife is happy. End of story!
4,Stainless Steel cages,"Well, here is another no brainer. Needed some cages for the wife and my mountain bikes. No need to go carbon here. These will not rust and they actually do what they were designed to do (hold water bottles). Good stuff, good price, and they are pretty darn light. I mean really, if your going to put a bottle of water on your bike is the extra 30 grams going to make any difference. Okay, the answer is NO (stop thinking about that). Geeez."
4,Nice but not exactly as described,"The short version is that these are fine cages, hold well and being SS won't mark up your bottles. Decently made, especially for the price, a classic look and very functional. The pair of these cost about the same as a single Blackburn bottle cage.Unlike the other reviewer who was dismayed to find the satin finish, I prefer it to the polished look.I hacked off a star because they are advertised all over the place (including the manufacturer's site) as being 44 grams. They are not. I bought two and they weighed in at 54 and 55 grams respectively (the same weight as the coated alloy Blackburn cages I am replacing). Not a HUGE deal, but that's too much a difference to be explained away by manufacturing tolerances... 44 grams is simply a lie."
3,A-OK,"This is a decent bottle holder that is decently made for the price; I had purchased it as a second bottle holder on my road bike. My main gripe about it is that it does not hold water bottles as firmly as my other aluminum bottle cage. I have yet to dislodge a bottle while going over a bump, but bottles have come loose before. Overall, I think there are bottle holders out there that are more fitted than this one that would be better suited for someone with a road bike."
3,stainless steel bottle cage,"This works fine, it is very light and not quite as sturdy as expected. It is made of tubular steel, not solid."
3,"Entertaing, Amusing, & Simple Story","Fine for 4-8 yrs. Curtis, the local letter carrier, is retiring today, and we readers get to witness the last day on the job--complete with goodbyes, well wishing, and ""We'll miss you Curtis""--with a brief retrospective look at Curtis' career thrown in.It's a neat story because it will get children listners, and adult readers discussing it during various points, as these are changes that children will witness for themselves one day. Good illustrations and a relatively quick read."
1,Never will do bisness with.,Book set was not complete. How can any bookstore do such a thing ? Send the set without a book
3,Fairly scholarly,"It was okay. The information in the book was good, there was just too much information. Author had a tendency to go on and on for an entire chapter what could have been summed up in a few paragraphs. I really didn't care to read about conclusions of this study conducted here or that study conducted there. If I wanted to read a text book, I would have purchased a text book. Again, it had some good information though."
5,My Generation,"This book is a much needed modern look at the issue of Narcissism running rampant in our culture. As a psychology student I find it disturbing that they are removing Narcissism from the next issue of the DSM. Why you might ask? It is because it has become so prevelant in our society that can one call something a disorder if the majority display this feature? This book explains the reasons my generation is the way it is. A group of insecure, self absorbed, overly confident, and shallow individuals."
5,From a Middle School Teacher,"Excellent read addressing issues of the teens today. As a teacher of 11-14 year olds and being in my 20s, I identify with this book on almost all levels. I also find myself quoting this and recommending to everyone. It's definitely being a Christmas gift for some colleagues and family members this year!"
4,Great Read for everyone.,"A friend told me about this book and I must admit, it had me captivated from the first page. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,easy read,This was a requirement for my sociology class. I found parts very interesting and parts very redundant and boring. I would definitely recommend this for new parent to read as it will give great insight into raising your child and show the repercussions of spoiling your child.
4,Christianity,"I loved this book. I found it to be well-researched and well-written. I even exclaimed ""right on"" a few times while reading it. the only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is because I dont think she understands evangelical Christians. Yes, God loves us as we are. But we are also flawed and sinful and weak and Christianity, the way it is meant to be practiced, has self-sacrifice, hard-work, good morals and ethics as priorities. it also denounces materialism and laziness. Christians, that truly follow Jesus, live in a way that she would approve. Volunteerism, donating money-time-resources, thinking of others before yourself, lending a hand to those who need it, etc etc."
4,"Important, although inevitably flawed","""Physician, heal thyself."" While this book is based on an impressive volume of research, it is written by a member of the group it purports to analyze. The author limited herself to investigating only the opinions of members of the GenMe generation, which is a perfectly legitimate scope for a single piece of research.But then she goes on to make sweeping generalizations and recommendations based on that limited perspective, without looking outside of her own house of mirrors for validation or guidance. In this regard, she's a product of her own narcissistic generation, obviously, so it should come as no surprise that she clearly models some of the very traits that she bemoans in her peers.Read this, but consider the source."
2,Generation ME Review,"After reading the back cover, I really looked forward to this book. When I got about half way through the book, I was very disappointed.I was required to read this book for an English Rhetoric class earlier this year. I read the book in about a day and in the end, realized, I just wasted a few hours of my life. The vast majority of this book is common sense. You don't need to write a book talking about how ""Generation Me"" (current generation) is more independent than the Baby Boomer Generation or that College is becoming more competitive for the current generation than the past one. If ""Generation Me"" was half the length and more compressed I would have rated this book higher. But it is not, and because of that I rated the book a one because the information is common sense and dragged out.Twenge's book ""Generation Me"" is an awful book that is well marketed. I could but only hope you do not take the time to read this poorly written book."
5,This book is superb,"I am a teacher. Reading this book was invaluable to me. Dr. Twenge's book, more than any other book, has helped me understand the values of the people I teach. Dr. Twenge's book also provides a fascinating statement about our American society. I think that some of the generational trends are laudable (e.g., a movement away from prejudice). However, if this push towards self-absorption continues, I worry about the shape of the future. Thank you Dr. Twenge for writing such an entertaining and enlightening book."
1,"Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitle--and More Miserable Than Ever Before","I hated it because first of all I got my book 3 weeks after I order thanks for the three to five days. On top of that the book was in horrible conditions not partially nor acceptable but in horrible conditions, I do not recommend you buy it from this placeGeneration Me: Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled--and More Miserable Than Ever Before"
1,It's a great read... if you're a liberal feminist,"I just finished this book for college and it makes me question if i choose the right university. In this book she praises tolerance, 'equality' and women's independence while insulting this generation's need for self-esteem and independence... so let me get this right, it's a good thing if a woman is independent, masculine, and doesn't get married till her late 20's but at the same time since people aren't getting married as early in life people get lonely and depressed, but there is no link between the two. No to mention the author praises a girl who 'lost her faith and gained hope in humanity' because of the church's views on homosexuals. as if losing your faith is a good thing since it was for a 'good' cause...i have never been so mad at a book before."
4,The Me Generation,"I thought this book was very insightful. I am part of this generation, and it was eye-opening and explains a lot of the inconsiderate rudeness I experience on a daily basis. This book was especially helpful, being a teacher, to understand from where many of the parents I now deal with are coming. There is a lot of finger pointing from many parents when their child has negative consequences at school for their behavior or work habits. I think all educators should read this book and rethink the focus on the ""self-esteem--you're special just because you breathe"" practices."
1,Generation Whine,"I was initially intrigued by the premise of this book, but after 150 pages I finally put it down. I have never heard anyone whine so much about how hard things are for their generation (get a clue, lady! My ancestors lived in tenements and before that in thatch huts with dirt floors and regular pogroms -- when exactly did you think life was easy?). On top of that, the author is confused about her own arguments. For instance, she argues, rightfully, against silly self-esteem building exercises and over-praising students, but confuses that with the idea that a person is unique and has self-worth regardless of what they do or accomplish. Similarly, she confuses narcism with the notion that such people have too much self-esteem, when in reality, such people clearly have very little self-esteem. Her snarky tone does not help her argument."
4,fascinating,"I find myself quoting this book to people and recommending it to just about everyone. Though the author can get a little redundant and caught up in statistics, if you're interested in human behavior, you might want to check this book out."
4,excellent understanding of today's young generation,"Excellent job explaining why the younger generation, and especially college students, are the way they are.Phillip WhiteSan Diego State University"
1,A book of references with a lot of skeptism,I've done my own share of research on the millenials/GenY and I get that there are many points of view. This book was dissappointing for a few reasons:-It was primarily pessimistic and the few areas where it was not the advice was highly vissionary-There were hundreds of foot notes. The entire book seemed to be a reference and a poorly compiled one.I find the book less than 50% accurate and a poor resource for anyone who has to interact with this generation.
3,Talking about my generation,"I ordered this from Amazon, a baby boomer read it, he informed me (and I believe him) that this book is good, but it is general enough to describe any generational issues. I polled a stranger on a plane ride to Denver, and we both found the final chapter (with essence of ""peace begins from within"") to be the most interesting part.As an avid reader of social commentary, I have recommended this to many. I also *think* that I am one of the first documented as ""narcissistic"" so of course identify fully with that chapter for one.Definitely fodder for a great conversation, and something to unite generations...I like to think GenMe has the motto of ""choose your own crisis"" but then again, that's spoken from a GenXer :)"
5,An enlightening perspective on current trends,"I initially selected this book in hopes that I would find the answers as to why my high school students (and oftentimes their parents) were so difficult. As a second year teacher (a Gen Y'er), the education profession had certainly not been what my professors had described to me and my young colleagues in college! Yet, this clever book, which relies on a mountain of research with dashes of colorful anecdotes mixed in, not only provided amazing perspective on the attitudes of my students and their parents, but in an ironic way served as a great resource for me to understand my own difficulties in my professional career. A must read for ALL new (and relatively-new) teachers!"
2,For the serious reader,"For the serious student of Human Motivation, the author here has missed the boat. Of course ""Culture"" changes over time, there is no disputing that, but, there are much more important issues that she has not addressed.It feels like she missed class in her undergraduate work the day ""Family Systems"" were discussed.The works of Erickson, Satire and of course John Bradshaw, to my way of thinking, will take us much closer to understanding ourselves and others,and will tell us how to institute positive change in our own lives and loves."
3,Gets the job done 4 the DDR game,"When it said that it was slip resistant, I was stoked, but it isn't. It does work great, but I tend to slip and slide around the living room. If you don't mind that, it will be fine."
4,Loads of Fun,"This game is really fun with a group of friends or on your own. It is challenging and can be a real workout. The only downside is that the dance pad sensors are not of the highest quality. However, I love this product and would recomend it to anyone."
1,Not for serious gamers...,"The pad works, but just barely well enough for me not to ship it back. About 90% of the time the buttons register, which makes sustaining a combo throughout a song almost impossible. I bought this mat just to have a second one for parties and such, but now I feel almost guilty having other people use it after trying it out myself. I keep thinking that maybe I'm just not stepping in exactly the right spot...If you're looking for a decent second pad, spend a few bucks more and try out the Konami Wireless Pad for about $20 (when I bought this pad it was around $10). The difference in quality between the Konami pad that came with the game and the pad on this page is definitely worth a few bucks.One more thing: The ""non-slip"" on carpet is a joke. If you play on anything over the Basic level you will be dancing half-way across the room before the song is over... except that the cord that comes with the mat is too short to allow that, and it has no handy ""break-away"" connector."
4,DDR Non Slip XBox dance pad review,"These dance pads were a great buy! They came at a very low cost so I was a little afraid of the quality of them, but they are great quality dance pads! The only negative comment I have about them is that the cables on them (the ones that connect to the XBox) could be a little longer and a little more padding would be nice. If you have hard wood floors like me, your feet tend to get a little sore after stomping on the pads to the DDR game.Overall, they are great quality and function perfectly!"
3,"Fun but not exactly ""non-slip""","The product functions properly and is fun, but it still slips around on the floor, so the marginal rating is for calling it a non-slip when it definitely still slips."
3,works fine but not my favorite,"Of the two pads out there that look the same this one has the non-slip backing and because of that, is a tad bit more bulky. I don't really prefer this one as much but that not in anyway due to its performance. They are equal is terms of sensitivity and response. have had this for about a year, and it's working fine. We don't use it very heavily but occasionally we do have DDR parties and only adults have used them so far. Overall, an ok product. Moves around on carpet despite the non-slip backing, but I for one was not surprised. It's physics."
1,Won't work with XBox 360,Very disappointed. Bought for Christmas present early - so couldn't return it. Have not been able to use it. It will not connect with XBox 360 nor will the disk play even. No one will buy it second hand too. Wasted my money. Had to buy something else similar for my daughter to use on the XBox 360.
4,Great!,"Dance pad came in perfect condition. Pad is comfortable on feet and responds well. Only problem is the grip on the bottom doesn't hold well with more active dancing, causing it to move around the floor (both carpet and wood). Doesn't usually detract from the game, I just have to move it back after every dance or 2 or secure it somehow."
3,Soft,"The plastic is soft; the top comes off the hinges. Otherwise good box. Took it up to the Cape, enough room for saltwater lures, hooks and leader, + all my freshwater stuff and mag light, hook remover etc. tray partitions are also soft, and often slip out of grooves. I used gorilla glue to seal them in place. For around 12 dollars though, its worth the price."
1,Plastic Hinges bent out of shape after 1st use.,"I used this a few times and can no longer use it. It is a perfect size for me. Everything about it is perfect. After the first use, the plastic hinges became soft. After a few uses, the top no longer stays on. It falls off everytime I open it. I am looking for a new tackle box right now and ran across this one and thought that I should warn."
3,"Home, Where is Home?","It was tough to keep up on which place the 2 accidental lovers were spending the night. They did do a fair job of investigation and figuring things out, but their plan had a lot of holes in it too. And after it was all over and the dust settled, Margot comes back and just kinda shrugs off her part in causing the deaths of not so innocent men. What was she thinking? Cheaters should all be snuffed out?Well I wish them all many nightmares ahead."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book might be up there with the worst I have read. I finished the book to find out who did it but, I can assure you that it was a difficult task to get to the end. The two main characters were hard to like and if Mia threw up, cried, stared at the floor, paled or had her knees buckle one more time I was going to scream. Matthew was just annoying! Their little italiczed conversations to themselves were so irritating. These two were perfect together - both equally annoying.The plot was rushed and ridiculous. Why the heck Mia would walk into a hotel with a suspected killer was just laughable.Oh well, better luck next time."
2,Not worthy of all the praise.,"I think Larry David is a genius...I'm still bemoaning the loss of Seinfeld along with the rest of the fans, and I think Curb Your Enthusiasm is even better. But this movie has very little resemblance to either. Some funny moments that probably would be enhanced without the expectation of a feature length Larry David production. The two main characters, Stephen Weber and Craig Bierko basically lack the requisite angst filled, anxiety ridden neuroses that we've become accustomed too. And neither possesses the ethnic credibility to make this work. It's just not very good, and that's a shame. Give movies another shot Larry-you're fans aren't going anywhere. 2 fillings."
5,Best comedy I've seen this year,"Terrific ensemble acting: even the bit parts were wonderfully paced. If you liked Seinfeld, you'll love this picture!"
2,THEY WERE MY QUARTERS,"Evan (Steven Weber) is a brain surgeon who runs his practice like a GP. His close cousin Richie (Craig Bierko) reminds us of a bad Brendan Fraser impersonator. Viola Harris plays his stereotypical doting Jewish mother. On a trip to Atlantic City, Evan gives Richie a couple of quarters which turns into a jackpot on the slot machine, which consisted of 3 sets of grapes, hence the wonderfully clever title.Evan thinks he should get half, while Richie does not. This leads to them both breaking with their girlfriends, a feud between them, and sudden financial irresponsibility on the part of Richie...oh what a clever name too!The plot is predictable and the jokes and bits are on the stale side. Well conceived, poorly written and executed. Larry David has done better.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, no nudity."
4,Brilliant,"I don't understand many of the negative reviews, this movie is brilliant....I can't say that's it's all that funny more clever than hilarious. The way the music is set to fit the scene is really over the top, love it"
3,quirky humor,"This is a funny movie, some people just don't get it though as you can see by some of the ratings on here) If you like seinfeld / curb your enthusiasim, this is the movie for you."
2,Let's be fair...,"Let's be fair. It's not Seinfeld or CYE. It IS TV humor and it doesn't really translate very well to a feature film. The premise is standard-mill Larry David and despite what the people who expect another Seinfeld say, it has the LD ring to it. Not terrible, and certainly not great, its an amateurish, mediocre movie...but still funny and ironic enough in parts to warrant a couple of stars."
5,wow,"get a copy, its great. heck, why not get 10 copies and give it to ur friends for christmas. if they dont like it, just take the cd back and backhand some sense into them :P"
2,Dissapointing,"As much as I love groups like Nightwish, Lacuna Coil, Faith and the Muse, Lacrimosa, and The Gathering, I was expecting to absolutely adore this group. Unfortunately, for me, I just couldn't get into it. I gave it several listens. I really tried. It just isn't there."
1,music for the mindless,"Just like ""beyond the veil"", ""world of glass"" was an EXTREME disappointment. It is nothing but growling and roaring. I think that I felt my IQ slip a few points just by reviewing the songs contained therein. I was so disappointed that i threw it away, just i did with ""beyond the veil"" Buying those two cds was a BAD investment. I feel sorry for those who are that ignorant to listen to this swill. For those who do not understand ""swill"" it means crap."
5,gothic metal brilliance,"Amazing! I heard other Tristania albums and thought them to be just OK, but this album changed my opinion entirely! The vocals are done masterfully, and the music is superb! Overall, a great album for gothic metal fans or fans of any kind of muetal, really. I could even see this appealing to non-metal fans as well."
2,Not the best of Tristania's albums...,"Tristania really disappointed me with World of Glass. It seems they are confused... it's like they don't know which way they should go after losing Morten. In my opinion, every song is a hit in their previous albums, but this album turned out to be some kind of a ""church choir"" CD. This is apparent in Wormwood and Hatred Grows. There are only 2 songs that are good... Deadlocked and Crushed Dreams. So if you're more into metal, don't buy this CD."
2,Not Very Deep,"Gabriela Zim's editors did her a disservice by allowing this DRAFT to be released as a final book. Reading between the lines the chapters' concepts are apparent, but they are not brought to fruition, and after a few chapters I was parched for some substance. I sensed a talented writer. But, really, I read this book and felt like I was reading Beverly Johnson's daytimer. Places and people are not well developed."
3,country and big band music together ?,i'm a huge neal mccoy fan however having a big band doing swing music in the back of country songs just dosen't do it for me. it dilutes the country flavor to the point that it's not country anymore. i'm sure older folks will like this because of the big band aspect but i think i'll stick to the neal mccoy live dvd.
5,Neal Mc Coy DVD,The DVD is so much better than the CD. I LOVE it and Neal! If you've never seen Neal live this would be a great way to experience him live.
4,Karim Abdul Jabbar did not become Muslim because of this book,"This is a valuable work that should be read to discover the life of a Muslim during the time of slavery since most slave narratives do not mention Islam even when 10 to 15 percent of slaves here were of Muslim origin.By the way, Karim Abdul Jabbar became Muslim at the hands of Khalifah Hamaas Abdul Khaalis, founder of the D.C. based Hanafi Madh-hab, around 1970. The venerable Sufi and Black Muslim leader wrote the work ""Look and See"" that will soon be released on Magribine Press. If someone makes claims that a work made someone become Muslims, or some other such claim, they should give references."
4,Reader Beware....,This is the book that convinced a young impressionable Lew Alcindor to embrace Islam and change his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. A good read that would make a better motion picture.
1,a glaring disappointment,"This product misfired on the technical side in various ways, making it impossible to utilize the software as it was (supposedly) designed to work. ""The Learning Company"" lost my trust in their products through their lack of quality control on this one."
5,none better,Mark Lowry has more talent than 10 people. His music is true and his voice is to die for. I truly enjoy his music on tape or on the Gaither show.
2,Mark Lowey Singer Not Comideian,Thought I was buying a comdey albumn after seeing a Funny U Tube of Mark..Was disapponited to discover he is a Religious Song writer-singer..
3,Not really E-writing,"The book is not really all about E-writing. Most of the techniques can be used for writing letters as well. Most of the information is common sense. It also gets rather wordy;if you like details about writing anything and everything, this book is for you."
4,Interesting,This is an interesting read. Though I know much of what I am reading it also makes me aware of some don'ts that I have not been aware of.
4,Aids to Better Writing,"At first I thought this book was just another 'Elements of Style' type book. The deeper I got into the book, the more I realized that this book gets much more specific, and thus it was more helpful in giving me suggestions and ideas that I could 'sink my teeth into'.Tho it is aimed at 'e' mail correspondence in the Corporate environment the application also applies to those of us working independantly, and just wanting to improve our day-to-day 'e' mail correspondence efficiency, and quality."
4,Tracks by the hottest Boston MCs,"Boston MCs and the whole Boston Underground Hip Hop scene seems to always get overlooked. Groups like Lif, 7L & Esoteric, Akrobatik, EDO G, and now the Kreators are putting out tracks and hits that'll split yer wig. I still think that one of the most slept on albums was No Contest, by the Kreators (Pick that *ish up when you buy this album!), and it was only when Guru blessed one of their tracks that people started really picking up on this group. 7L & Eso had one of the WU, and kids were like who's dat? Anyway, this is a compilation album chock full of Boston flava. If you want to hear how we do it in the Bean, cop this CD."
4,solid album,all the undeground hip hop artists from tha bean on one disc. its pretty hot. I think that this cd would be a lot bigger and everyone would listen to it if they knew that beantown CAN rap and they proved it with this album!!!!!
1,The Title Of This BookFalse Advertisement,Its a question and answer book on exorcisim. NOT A MANUAL !!!
1,Misleading Title,This isn't a manual on exorcism. It's basically a F&Q; on the subject of exorcism. There are many other books that fares better than this book.My recommendation: Hostage to the Devil
5,my favorite classical CD,I love this fine selection of Puccini's best loved arias. The peroformances are all great especially Felicia Weathers as Madam Butterfly. I play this CD a lot and have never tired of it.
5,This music stirs my soul.,I play it all the time in my antique shop and my customers never fail to ask me about it.
2,Two Pipers,"I was a little annoyed that Piper Two was portrayed as an ""i do what i want to do"" girl, because she isn't that way at all! However, this is certainly a very good Charmed book in the sense that it has a lot of the feeling from the Prue times."
4,ITALIAN DINNER PARTY,"INVITE YOUR FRIENDS OVER FOR LASAGNA. PUT THIS CD ON, HAND THEM A GLASS OF GRAPPA AND YOU HAVE ALL THE MAKINGS OF A GREAT EVENING...THIS IS THE REAL DEAL, SUNG IN ITALIANO."
5,"New ""old-fashioned"" comic","I've just bought and read this recently, and for my first Astro City book, I'd say it makes perfect sense without having read the previous book. There are three plot threads here: the Confessor trains his new sidekick Altar Boy, there's a serial killer on the loose, and there's an alien invasion. The most important of these is the first, in which the Confessor not only teaches his pupil the mechanics of crime fighting, but also what it means to be a hero. When the mayor of Astro City outlaws super-heroes and starts rounding them up, the Good Samaritan runs away! How heroic is that? Yet the Confessor and Altar remain to fight the good fight. With most of the emphasis being on the first and third plot threads, the serial killer plot gets a little short-changed (oh, so THAT'S the serial killer. Huh. I never would have guessed.) Nevertheless, this flaw, if it is a flaw, isn't bad enough that it hurts the book as a whole, for me anyway."
5,The fun continues... ;),"The Astro City series, AS a series, is EXCELLENT! This is the second Asro City graphic novel published after Life in the Big City.If you've liked the first one, you'll LOVE this one as well. If you didn't READ the first one, you'll STILL LOVE this one, although I would recommend reading Life in the Big City first..Anyhow, Kurt Busiek is a very talented man, creating comicbooks for people who LOVE comicbooks. And somehow manages to combine the excitment of corny 4-color superhero comix WITH seriousness, insight and maturity..How does he do it? No idea!This entire GN is basically, I think, a twist on DC's Batman and Robin characters.. ;)That's it, won't reveal any plot, just a warm-hearted recommendation!Can't go wrong with Astro-City... ;)"
4,"Good, but not the best Astro City","I had all three other TPB's of Astro City and loved them all. ""Confession"" was the last one I read and I have to say it was a little bit dissapointing. Not that it wasn't a good read, but the hype from all the other reviews was very misleading. Perhaps it is the parallels between the Confessor/Altar Boy and Batman/Robin of DC. There were some twists and turns, but at times the story was a bit redundant and not as interesting as I would have believed by the hype.Astro City is a great comic, no doubt, but if you are looking for the best issues, these aren't them. If you are a fan of the series, buy this, you won't be dissapointed, it is still Astro City and fun. Just don't get ahead of yourself."
3,ok,"This Audiovox SIRPNP1 Sirius Satellite Radio Tuner is ok, but have to set in window sill to work. Doesn't seem to get a signal otherwise."
1,They really should allow zero star reviews...,"This is, without a doubt, the worst book I've ever read. So bad that I just couldn't bring myself to finish it-- and I wholeheartedly believe in finishing any book I start. The plot was utterly ridiculous and the dialogued so cliched that I find it hard to believe that this book was written by an adult. I'd like to think that others that have given this book a favorable review are youngsters that still have time to develop a more discriminating taste in literature. But I won't hold my breath.If suspence or horror is what you're looking for, run away from this book. On the other hand, if you want to read something aloud to your friends for a great, good laugh-- this is the ticket!"
3,More suspense than horror,"I too will take the middle ground on this book. It has its' strengths (mainly a really, really nasty villain who is all that much nastier because he is human.), and some decently developed characters. As some of the more critical reviews have stated, however, the plotting is a little thin. The most powerful element in constructing a great horror or suspense novel is the authors' ability to create a suspension of disbelief. The reader has to be able to accept the fantasy that the author has created, and I found myself questioning some of the plot developments that Rick Hautala inserted into this book especially concerning the inability of the police to figure out what was going on. Other than this I found it to be a decent read-nothing to really brag about but I have surely read a lot worse novels that have sold a lot better."
1,I'd give it no stars if I could,"One of the worst books I've ever read. Suspenseless, leaden, with cliches leaping out of every paragraph. Out of print and deservedly so. I've read numerous Hautala books...enough of them to say unequivocally that the man is a really poor writer with no sense of plotting, characterization, and pace."
1,Which connectors?,What are the connectors on this cable? No one is going to buy this without that information.
5,Great notebook using T7100 processor,"My last Lenovo notebook got stolen by thieves afer a year of abusive use, so I brought this one. With updated the bigger hard disk, dual layer DVD writer and newer T7100 CPU, this notebook flys.Like everyone else, the notebook comes with Vista Business and whole bunch of trial software installed. Have to remove those trial software. The T7100 CPU runs faster and use less power. 160GB drive is also nice to hold a lot of files on it.The 1GB ram is two 512MB ones. I took the outter one out and replaced it with a generic 2GB one to make the total memory 2.5GB.My last Lenovo was very reliable, also is this one. Highly recommended."
1,People Do Not Listen,I have ordered the this product three times and eack time they send me the worng ONE. WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR SOMEONE TO PAY ATTENTION OR TO RESPOND?????
3,More fun indie pop by Barcelona!! - 3.5 stars,"Barcelona must absolutely love its style because all of their albums sound exactly the same (just with new songs). This isn't really a bad thing considering they write some very catchy and fun songs (which most, admittedly, people won't like). As I've said many times with this band, it's a love-it-or-hate-it kind of situation. The lyrics and the singer himself are very nerdy, if that kind of thing throws you off. ""Transhuman Revolution"", though, is definitely a satisfactory album for fans of the group. I don't think this album will win over any new fans, but that doesn't really matter I suppose. If you like indie pop you might like this, but that's up in the air. Recommended for Barcelona fans and the curious.Highlights include:""Intro""""Everything Makes Me Think About Sex""""West Coast Radio""""Watching You Watching Us""""Fleeting Frame""""Beautiful""""The Power Of Jen""""Extro"""
4,Great tunes!,"Goldfrapp are an exciting band whose single 'Ooh La La' (from Supernatural) is getting airplay on quite a few TV shows. Their album We Are Glitter is an interesting experiment: official, band-sanctioned remixes of songs from previous CDs. The remixed 'Ride a White Horse,' 'Number 1' and 'Strict Machine' are the highlights of this release; they are essential for aficionados of electronic dance music. Benny Benassi's 'Ooh La La' remix more well-intentioned than successful, but otherwise the additional tracks are enjoyable and worth owning."
3,It's Not the Voice,"It's not the voice, she has the pipes of Kate Bush -- it's the songs. The lyrics consist entirely of ""oh baby"", ""you are my man"", and ""let's hump"". It's like the very worst of Marilyn Monroe. That kind of saccharin baby talk that is for me at least, completely unsexy. The music is techno-pop and tends to ramble thematically too. Although technically proficient, together the whole effect is heavy handed and tasteless. That said, maybe I picked a bad one. Every band has one. She's very pretty, so perhaps I need to see the video. Maybe that's the trick. But if you want to start on Goldfrapp, I would suggest picking a different one than this."
5,Grand playing with a rare sense of depth.,"Radu Lupu is a pianist with an introspective bent that is perfect for these two massive sonatas. His playing posseses a warmth of tone, a depth of understanding, and a sense of breadth that is essential for these pieces. His sense of phrasing holds the music together and carries the listener along from the first note to the last."
5,"SIX GUYS,SIX VOICES...THAT'S IT!!!!!","ONE CANNOT BELIEVE THAT EVERY SOUND YOU HEAR ON THIS CD IS VOICE. THIS VOCAL BAND HAS A DRUMMER, A BASS AND THE BEST HARMONIES SUNG BY THREE OF THE BEST VOCALISTS EVER. THEIR SONGS ""JUST BECAUSE"", ""SCARED"" AND ""SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW"" ARE RADIO-READY POP SONGS. I'M SURE THIS GROUP IS GOING TO RISE TO THE FOREFRONT OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY..THEY HAVE THE TALENT TO DO IT!"
5,Good match for the basic sauce book!,Has some really good suggestions for quick and tasty sauces for that Pasta I do so love. Top of the line quality!
3,Not as good as what I remembered,"I saw this movie when it FIRST came out on VHS and thought I liked it. I was impressed with the skills of the young Pistol, like when he was walking on the rail of the railroad tracks, dribbling the ball on the railroad ties.In this viewing, I didn't have the same impression. The basketball footage is comical in how easy everything is portrayed. People don't play defense, Pistol gets wide open layups, etc. I could have beaten the teams they played, and I don't even play basketball.Then there are the racist undertones, while Pistol isn't portrayed as the racist, his teammates/coach/community are, there is no condemnation of it either. It makes for a very uncomfortable viewing in 2007.This movie is mildly entertaining, but the voice over narration is creepy and the story line takes far too long to get going."
4,Pistol Pete: Birth of a Legend,"Pistol Pete was a spectacular movie. I liked this movie because it was based on an individual's true story. This movie was very inspirational and could teach kids everywhere to go for something that they think is not possible to reach for. Pete Maravich was one of the best role models that a kid could look up to. Hey, the kid started a varsity team when he wasn't even in high school!People call Pete ""The Pistol"" because he has very quick movements in his game and is very talented in his sport.I recommend this movie to everyone, young and old."
3,Great Family Movie,"This is a great family movie. Sometimes the acting is a bit ""over the top"", but it is a very nice movie about how ""Pistol"" Pete Maravich got his start in basketball as well as what drove him to become one of the greatest basketball players ever.It has a nice inspirational message for any boy or girl who wants to play organized basketball (or any sport, for that matter)."
2,skip it,"I thought this would cover pete maravich through his time in the nba and perhaps through his untimely death. It only portrays his childhood through high school. In addition, I did not realize that he or a voice which was supposed to be him is narrating the movie in the background. Perhaps there's an option to eliminate that. I'm not sure."
3,Good Inspiration for young players,"I purchased this DVD for my son who loves basketball and had never heard of Pistol Pete. He was really inspired by his story. After watching the video, he has been practicing some tricky passes and fancy shots. We were disappointed that the movie did not show any real-life shots of Pistol Pete playing in the pros or even in college."
5,Great Inspirational Movie,"It is so refreshing to watch a movie that conveys a theme of hard work, desire and focus. This is definitely a must see, especially for those with kids. I think that my three-year old has watched it over 50 times."
4,Great intro to a Legend,"I bought this as a gift for my 11 year old step son. He had just begun playing basketball and his Dad wanted him to watch this movie to motivate him and show him what was possible with hard work and determination. Unfortunately, my fiance died the day after the movie arrived and he never had the chance to watch it with him. We watched the movie together about a month after his funeral and not only did it have the desired effect his Dad originally had hoped for, it is now a special, family movie that will live in the heart of this little boy for the rest of his life.I recommend it for all fathers and sons as well as moms and step moms to watch with their would be future stars.Kelly"
5,THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"This is the Greatest Movie ever made. ""Pistol"" Pete was the greatest player ever and this movie shows his childhood perfectly. I am now a high school student and this movie related to me beautifully."
3,"Good movie, lousy sound!",My 7 year old son and I enjoyed the movie. The sound was really lousy though. I don't know if the DVD was bad or if that is just how the sound track sounded.
2,Not what I expected,I was expecting the actual Pistol Pete movie that I saw many years ago. I think this had portions of the movie but was not a complete movie. I wanted my 7-year-old grandson to see it as he is a basketball player and I thought all the moves and tricks would inspire him. I was very disappointed in it.
4,"a true legend, a head of his time",very entertaining. alot of great memories of pistol pete. should inspire youth to really work at the game other than shooting
4,THE PISTOL THE BIRTH OF A LEGEND,I LOVED WATCHING PETE MARAVICH AS A KID BUT I WISH HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN IN THE MOVIE AND SOME OF HIS FILM HIGHLIGHTS FROM COLLEGE AND THE NBA. THE MOVIE I THOUGHT WAS REALLY GOOD BUT HIS COMMENTARY WAS VERY QUIET SO KINDA HARD TO HEAR. OVERALL I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS WELL WORTH IT.
4,An unconventional darkness,"This is indeed as it is billed: a dark album. However, Schlunk's songs have a style to them that makes this a very different kind of darkness. ""Ivory and Lace"" is probably my favorite track, if I had to pick one."
3,Glad to see him GONE!,"In case we need to be reminded, it's all here in the book of Bushisms. Amazing, always, to see on page how destroyed the poor English language was. Adios, forever."
2,dissatisfied,"This book appears to be useful only for secondary teachers. That was not stated in any of the information about the book and I would not have purchased it had I known. The author should have thought of that in the title, since its not what every teacher needs to know, but only secondary teachers. Its was not useful at all for people at the elementary level."
3,Great for Secondary Teacher - not so much for Elementary level,"I am thinking about going into the teaching field at the elementary level so for that aspect, this book doesn't really help. However it does help overall with the fear of becoming a teacher because I think every teacher has the same fears. The classroom, the students staring at them, the administration, etc. She does give some tips that would work with both elementary and secondary but these are very few. It really is for the secondary level. There was nothing in the title to suggest that the book was exclusive to the secondary level. I probably will keep this book mainly for a reference if I ever do decide to teach at the secondary level. For those of you only contemplating the elementary level, look elsewhere because you will be disappointed when all she talks about is writing out ""referrals"" for the disruptive teens."
1,Waste of $$$$$$,"Don't spend your money! The tips in this book are teaching 101, if you have been to college :) then this is what you learned. Pre-service teachers don't waste your money -- the tips in this book are in your text book and free on the internet!"
5,Best CD I've heard this year,"Several years ago I bought Puirt A Baroque's CD ""Kinloch's Fantasy."" That was my favorite CD for a couple years, especially David Greenberg's fiddling. Now I'm collecting other CDs he played on. I hesitated to buy ""Castles, Kirks & Caves"" because I expected it to be solo cello -- not my favorite instrument! But now I listen to this CD over and over, and I've set the iTunes rating at 5 stars for almost every song. My 26-year-old tenant/housemate, who favors gangsta rap, likes this CD too. Sorry if I'm not good at describing music better (don't ask me to explain the difference between a strathspey and a slip jig!) but I'll just say that this CD gets it right."
5,Beautiful and mysterious!,"What a wonderful relaxing cd. Beautiful, mysterious sounding, yet fun! Abby puts you right in the ""Castles, Kirks & Caves""!!"
3,Like being at Jazz Fest,"I first hear Kermit at Jazzfest '99, where he played virtually this entire CD. Everytime I listen to it, I'm back in that huge, hot, tent! This disc is probably more for the trad jazz lover, with a little unexpected(like his daughter singing lead)."
2,"Un reloj bonito , pero al año de uso la correa se rompe","Hola buenos dias, ya he tenido 2 relojes freestyle y la verdad son muy bonitos y comodos pero la correa despues de un año se rompe y no hay mas nada que hacer , el reloj se pierde."
3,average,"The clock battery was short, in fact the months of buying it discharge and damage the belt, it broke the plastic as if it had deteriorated, a need to improve such details as"
4,Still Bouncing!!,"Our 10 month old will crawl over to this hanging in the doorframe and call out to us because she thinks it is so much fun and wants to get in! She doesn't stop bouncing! At first when she was 5 months old she would spin on her toes then when she got the hang of it and started bouncing she wouldn't stop. This has been a great source of excercise for her and she still loves it!The only thing I would change is the older the baby gets and her arms now longer I have had to watch her fingers from gripping the edges and the possibility of getting pinced in between the bumper part and the door frame...hasn't happened yet, but it is a caution!HINT: if your baby is having a hard time settling for bed, this is an excellent way to get all the wiggles out! This was a tip recommend to us try BEFORE our baby could crawl and this has wOrked for us and even now that she is almost walking!"
3,Will Not Work For Everyone!,"Hello!The disadvantages on this product is it requires a certain size moulding,the clamps are made out of plastic.Plastic breaks easily compare to metal.Metal rust in time.Great for baby to excerise in.Remember everyone's experience is unique!"
2,too bad if you own an older home,"I purchased this after my daughter played in one at my friend's house. Unfortunately, I could not use one at my house as our moldings are too big and the jumper can not be adjusted. I am very disappointed because she had such a great time playing in the other one."
2,Doesn't work for all doorways,"We have a craftsman home with large wood mouldings. Brought the jumper home with great expectations only to be disappointed that it wouldn't work with said mouldings. There is no way to adjust it, either. I think the packaging should give you specific doorway requirements. We will return it and try the Fisher-Price jumperoo which does not require a doorway."
1,Could not assemble item,"I received this item to give as a baby shower gift. I wanted to put it together to see how cute it was before I gave it to her. When I tried to assemble it, I found that the rings on the seat were not spaced properly, so I couldn't even put it together. After struggling for an hour, I realized that even if I could put it together, it would be impossible to ever get the cover off to wash. Maybe the one I got was defective, but it seems like any of them would be a HASSLE to de-assemble for cleaning. Very unsatisfied."
4,"5 month old loves, but its not high enough","My 5 month old started using this at 3 1/2 months and just loves it. However he is now to tall for it at only 5 months. I've extended it as far as it can go but his feet touch the ground to far. Your babies toes should only touch, barely, when sitting in a still position. But this one doesn't go any higher up and his whole feet touch the ground. If you have a bigger baby, heavy or length wise, I would suggest a different one."
4,Worth every penny,"My son's an active child -- he was driving me crazy at 4 months because he got bored so quickly. I bought him this jumper and a swing; the swing wasn't active enough, but the jumper was a hit! I could put him in it while I washed dishes etc and he stayed entertained. He is 11 months old now and he still uses it occasionally."
5,We like the Bumper Jumper,"I bought this jumper b/c I have been pleased w/all the other Graco products we own. At first when we put it up, it hung too low to the ground, and I was tempted to take it back. However, after reading some of these reviews I discovered you can shorten the strap - you have to loop it back through the buckle. It's in the instruction book - it's a little tricky but once you get it figured out your baby will be off and jumping. The bumper works as a great tray for toys and drool and it also keeps your baby from getting too close to the door jam. Great product - has lots of spring to it and so far my son has really enjoyed it."
4,"fun product, short life","Our daughter loved this jumper ... for a little while. She was an early walker and once she learned to walk she didn't want anything to do with it. Also note, it needs to be used in a doorway that has a frame. Many of the larger doorways and openings in our home have no molding, so it had to be put up on a smaller, framed door. It bothered my husband and I more than our daughter.For the time we were able to use it, our little girl had a lot of fun. And it kept her out of trouble."
4,Read your manual for height adjustment!,Everyone keeps saying how they have to finagle the jumper to get the proper height. The manual gives you directions on how to make it higher if it is too low to the ground. You can get the directions off of the www.babiesrus.com website. My doorways are very low and I was able to make it very high. Any questions about this you can email me at colemkes@msn.com.Shanna Lemke
1,Unsafe in model with straps!,"My baby's grandmother purchased this fun-looking jumper for my son, and is now returning it after the seat (and my son) fell out! The model purchased was the 8740/8750 with the straps (not holes). After struggling to slide the seat straps into the tray part as directed, we tested the seat, hooked the jumper to the door frame as directed, then placed my 18lb son in for a little fun. After 5-10 minutes of swaying, he crashed to the ground, hitting his head on the door frame on his way down. All seven straps were dislodged and he was left on the floor still in the seat. We should have guessed that if you push a strap through, even if it has tabs that are designed to hold it from comming out, the plastic can become bent and the straps may not hold as designed. It is a aweful design. The Johnny Jump-up (by Osk-Kosh B'gosh) is a much safer design!"
4,Lot's of Fun,"Someone lent me this when my son was a baby. I have since returned it, but will probably buy one for my next child. My son loved this and had a lot of fun in it. I liked the all around bumper and it's designed in such a way that his fingers couldn't get pinched.It is nice that the straps adjust to fit the height of your child and doorway, though I found it a little difficult to adjust them. One thing to keep in mind is it doesn't work in all types of doorways. The doorway needs to have a frame on it, it can't just be an open space and there needs to be enough space above the door to attach it. Suprisingly we had only a few doors it worked on and they weren't in the best locations (I would have loved to have used it in kitchen). But the fun my son had outwieghed our door problems."
2,Mom of two in Oregon,Unfortunately my son hated this Bumper Jumper. Every time we put him in it he would cry. He didn't seem to have enough control; the product moves A LOT when the baby isn't specifically jumping in it. He LOVED the Evenflo MegaSaucer. I would recommend that product over this one.
5,This is heaven sent!!!,"My 4 month old son LOVES to stand, but my arms get so tired after awhile. He now hates all of his toys like his bouncer and swing because he does not want to sit down. I read about this on the website and read all of its great review. I was not sure if he was old enough yet but when I read that 3 month old kids could use it and loved it I knew I had to get it. My son has the BEST time in this jumper. He will stay in it up to an hour and has a ball. I love how easy it is to put up and take down and the tray is awesome. My son is teething so the slobber is never ending but I don't have to wory about it getting on the carpet because the tray catches all of it. I think every parent should get this for their child, it is very safe, affortable, and loads offun :-)"
1,Won't work in some older homes!,"We have an 85-year old home with original beautiful plaster walls and wonderful large mouldings. The Bumper Jumper (which I really wanted to use!!) wouldn't fit as the directions described, due to the clamp-like structure at the top being too small to fit over the top of the tall mouldings. Plus, our plaster walls are wider than the 3"" limit allowed safely by this toy. Too bad they don't make the top clamp taller or at least adjustable."
5,30 minutes of fun,"My baby is now 6 months old and he loves his bouncer... I put him in a month ago and he didn't know what to do, but once he got a hang of it, he bounces himself silly... He loves it."
5,great way for exercise and fun,my 5 month old son loves this! when i am working on my computer i sit in the chair next to him while he jumps away. i put toys on the tray for him to play with and he keep busy plus it is good exercise for his legs. he jumps around so much that his socks are falling off.
1,DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!,"ANY JUMPER IS TERRIBLE FOR YOUR BABY'S SPINE! YOU MIGHT NOT SEE THE INJURY NOW, BUT WHEN THEY ARE OLDER THEY WILL FEEL THE EFFECTS! THESE AWFUL DEVICES ACTUALLY COMPRESS VERTEBRAE FROM THE FORCE OF THE JUMP...A BABY'S BODY IS NOT MEANT TO TAKE THIS TYPE OF FORCE. WHY WOULD YOU INTENTIONALLY HARM YOUR CHILD?!? IF YOU PURCHASE ANY TYPE OF JUMPER PLAN FOR A LOT OF TRIPS TO THE CHIROPRACTOR IN THE FUTURE FOR YOUR CHILD!"
3,Get me out...PLEASE!!,I bought this jumper for my 5 month old son a month ago and it's only been recently that he's really beginning to enjoy it. The one thng is getting him in and out of it. Putting him in it takes two people...one to hold it and the other to try and fanagle him in since he's too young to keep his legs straight to get into the holes. Getting him out you have to lift him and the jumper up together then kind of pull him out. If only you could lift the front and lock it like a swing...it would be perfect!
5,My baby loves it!!!,"When I first saw this jumper, I thought it's new to us. Then I was worried that my baby might not like it, but I was wrong. My 7 months old girl loves it since we first introduce to her when she was 4 months old. Whenever we put her there, she starts to jump and singing and expressing her joy just playing with this for an hour or more. Fisher-Price has a big set of jumper with all those fancy toys that takes up a lot of space and won't work for my baby because she will be enjoying herself just jumping in the jumper, she doesn't need any of those fancy toys!! I highly recommand this for room spacing, it does not need too much space comparing to Fisher-price ""big-old"" jumper!"
4,Must Buy for Your Baby!,"Ok, so I have a normal child who has a short attention span -she is only 6 months old. This seems to be the only thing I can keep her in an hour at a time. I have to take her out of it or she'd spend all day in it. Great for when I'm getting ready for work. My little one loves this bouncer. The tray is handy for catching drool (just be sure to clean it out!) and handy for holding her favorite toy. A little hard to get her in and out of, but after a few times, we've mastered it (I think you'll find that with any bouncer.) Pattern on the seat is cute. All in all, a great purchase. I don't think I could live without it!"
5,I loved this jumper!,This Jumper is the best! My daughter loved it! The best thing about it was that because of the bumpers her fingers never got jammed like they did in the evenflo.. I would recommend this jumper and have been to anyone who's baby is ready for one!
2,It is way to long for me to even use,"My son could use this for only 1 month. By the time he could hold his head up well enough for this, which he was very early at just a couple months being very strong, no more bobble head. Maybe it's my doorways that aren't tall enough, or the cord is too long and I can't shorten it any more. I think this product was a waste. If your doorways are the typical around 6.5, 7', I wouldn't waste my time, unless you have somewhere else besides the doorway to hang this.Sorry, it's just my opinion, but I wish I could take it back and get something that my son will actually use."
2,not compatible with older homes,"This looks like a great product, however if you have an older home it may not fit your door frames. Our home is from 1917 & the moulding above the doors is 6"" high & 2.5"" wide (on each side), and the clamp cannot open wide enough to fit over the top of the frame. The description says fits doorframes FROM .5 inches, so I thought we'd be safe as no maximum was specified. The clamp should be redesigned to open about 2"" wider. If we could use this jumper, I'm sure the baby would love it...so if your home has ""normal"" doorframes, go ahead & order it!"
5,The Best!,"This was the best gift I received when having my son. He loved it! I began using it when he was a little past 4 months old. He is now 9 months and is still loving it, but has almost grown out of it. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,Great way to occupy your baby!,"This is a great toy. My son used it from about 3 months. He thinks it is the most fun. He stayed in it one night when we had company for 2 hours. He just laughs and laughs. I have talked to people who say their child doesn't like it because they don't jump. Well, my child didn't jump in it either for the first several weeks but once he caught on he loved it. He liked sitting in it an looking around even when he didn't have the jumping figured out. This is a great way to keep your little one occupied!"
1,"8 of 10 are not the originals, save your money!","Another really cheap rip-off, and frankly, a waste of everybody's time. Even the two original tracks are poorly edited. The [small print] disclaimer says ""This album may contain re-recorded tracks by the original artist. Tracks featuring groups may not include the original members."" Well, if any or all of that is the case, then why even bother making this joke? Not even worth $3. Put that money toward the originals. Deserves zero stars."
5,Medicine Hands was a gift.,This book was bought as a gift for a family member to use in her work. I never read it but the person that got it was very happy with it.So the five stars are happy stars.
2,Get the updated version!,"The updated version of this book is so much better than this one. I didn't notice that there was an updated version when I bought it, I was going too quick. But I went back and bought it and it's a truly helpful, awesome tool for those doing oncology massage. I had gone to a class 6 years ago but this really helped me refresh my memory and get prepared to do more oncology massage."
1,Big flaw in kindle version,"Don't purchase the kindle version! This may be a good book, but it is unusable without a table of contents. Is it possible to return a kindle book?"
5,This Grandmother Loves This Book!,"My grandkids are the light of my life and when I heard about Sue and Julie's book, I knew I had to have it. While I share a wonderful relationship with my grandkids, there are areas that I wanted help with. As I don't live in the same town, the telephone hints were the greatest. Before, the kids would answer in short one-word sentences, now they're getting involved and I'm satisfied that we've connected when I hang up. The recipes and things to make items are on my list to do on my next visit. And I've just begun to scratch the surface of this multi-faceted book. I know it's going to keep me and my grandkids happily busy for years to come."
5,Great tips for grandparents,I enjoyed the great ideas for activities to do with my grandsons. The tips on spending time together were helpful too! Good book!
5,Enthusiastically recommended for grandparents everywhere.,"Now in an updated fourth edition, Grandloving: Making Memories With Your Grandchildren, A World Away... Or Next Door is an award-winning collection of creative memory-making, family-bonding advice and activities, written especially for grandparents. Chapters address how to smoothly make the transition to grandparenthood without stepping on the toes of one's adult children, what to bring and what to expect on the very first visit to see one's grandchild, how to keep in touch and maintain a loving bond across long distances, and much more. Sample activities include making a simple kite from a bread back, or a futuristic paper airplane from a straw and two paper loops, to more adventurous and modern activities such as geo-caching. Enthusiastically recommended for grandparents everywhere."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed by this book. It is mostly a compilation of projects one can do with children. There is not much discussion about infants.
5,Perfect for long-distance Grandparents!,"I loved this book. It gave me so many ideas for how to keep alive a loving relationship with my first Grandchild who is a 90 minute plane ride away.Best of all, now that a sibling is on the way, there are creative ideas for making the first-born a welcoming big brother. As a mother of three, I thought I knew a lot, but Grandloving gave me a starlingly fresh perspective on how to approach this fun new role. This is also a good gift idea for friends who are becoming ""first-time Grandparents""!"
5,Excellent resource,"Keeping in touch and being a part of your loved ones' lives is a big challenge in today's busy world - whether you live in the same town or live far away. Grandloving contains great ideas for making the most of the precious time you do have to spend with your grandkids. It includes reminders of how to play simple childhood games you hadn't thought about in years - as well as instructions on how to play some of those games long distance. It also has great ideas for fun things to tuck into your suitcase on your next visit. Grandloving is full of simple and inexpensive ideas that can help you create memories that will last a lifetime. What a wonderful resource this book is for any grandparent!

5,A complete resource for every grandparent!,"Grandloving conjures up all sorts of fantastic images of fun to be had with grandchildren! Chock full of inspiring recipes, activities, crafts, ways to connect, and ways to express your love to your grandchildren, it makes for a true treasure that belongs on the bookshelf of every grandparent! I love that it includes everything from teaching responsibility to making edible jewels to helping grandkids feel comfortable in an unfamiliar environment; a well-rounded, practical, and complete resource!"
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this book, kindle version, hoping it would give me ideas on how to stay close to my grandchildren while living on the road as a full time rver. The reviews certainly made me think that there would be a wealth of information in this book to do so. Alas, I was greatly disappointed. Although, it did offer a few ideas that I could try & a few I could build on, I felt this book was mainly a game & craft oriented book geared toward little ones. It didn't offer much in the way of connecting with tweeners & teenagers. I also must admit that I found a majority of the games & craft ideas to be pretty cheesy too.In summary, I was vastly disappointed with my purchase."
5,A book for newbies or old hands,"Are you an about-to-be grandparent? Then you need this book. Or maybe you are an old hand with a ""PhD."" in grandparenting? I promise you will still find an array of fun, inexpensive ways to form closer ties with those grandchildren in ""Grandloving.""Sue Johnson, along with daughter-in-law Julie Carlson, have gathered an amazing collection of tidbits of wisdom, creative ideas and just plain, fun things to do with kids. They provide a wonderful guide to those who might be a little nervous at the idea of small children around again. With creative ideas that fit every stage from infant to adolescence, any grandparent or parent will love this book.The ideas are easy and inexpensive, from the ""Nut's on a Run"" walnut-shell racecars to the ""Snowman in a Box"" that will delight children.""Grandloving"" offers a myriad of ideas for fun and building closeness, especially if you live far away from the grandchildren. Great as a gift book."
3,A beginners guide,"If you are new to the Forensic game then this book might make good reading. A large portion of the book is on disk and data structure & geometry. This makes for interesting reading if you have not covered this before, but if you are an investigator, this will be 'old' and somewhat irrelevant news.Chapters include information on;* PDA/Electronic Organisers,* Search and seizure of PC's* A little on Network and encryption (informational reading only).Overall, not a book I would recommend for someone who has ""been there, done that"". From each book I read I expect find a little bit of information that is new to me, but unfortunately I went hungry on this one! I probably wouldn't call it a 'Practitioners Guide', but more of a 'beginners guide'."
4,"Suspenseful, Entertaining, Good descriptive details.","Great suspense and very well blended, with just enough traces of sarcastic humor"
2,Bearstone Review,"This book left out one thing I think every good book should have, SUSPENCE! This book never had anything to make you wonder what will happen next. If you like suspence in a book you proboly won't like this book, but, if you don't like suspence by all means buy this book and you will proboly love it.Rateingsbest Worst10---------0Setting=9Suspence=1Charicters=10Plot=8Total(overall)=6.5"
2,SAVE YOURSELF DON'T READ BEARSTONE,"Bearstone is a story about a Indian boy named Cloyd and an old man named Walter. Coyd has no parents and is sent to live with Walter. Walter gives Cloyd a horse, which becomes Cloyd's only real friend. In my opinion Bearstone is not a good book and I don't recommend it. I don't think it has enough action, and it definitely lacks excitement"
2,Great until they swell,"These batteries work very well until they swell up, put pressure on the hard drive, and cause HDD failure. I read and discounted quite a few horror stories on the web regarding this problem, and now I'm having to send my AV500 in for HDD repair and battery replacement. Archos tech support claimed a 3-month battery warranty although their web site says one year- we'll see what happens when I send it in. Otherwise, it's a great product. Maybe other replacement batteries provide an air gap to prevent the squashed HDD problem, but Archos is still cranking out this same old type. I'm just going to buy more THIN batteries since my 1-yr warranty has almost expired.Well, I just got my new replacement battery after a 2-wk turnaround- it works, and it's not swollen. I read on the web that you should keep them about 40% charged and stored in a cool place when not in use. The fridge, not the freezer may be a good place if battery is kept dry. I'll try it."
3,Can't wait till they come back,Me and my friend Tim went out to his car to let some steam release with a little smoke instead I came back to work turned on to B-Side Players; on fire. I'm loca to see them live! Please get back to Burque soon.
4,Groovin',"I find myself singing along full blast, wishing I was a part of this band. Up until now, I have only seen them live and have been captivated by their groovin' energy on stage. I rate this album with 4 stars only because there is nothing like hearing the songs during a live show. I am ready the next time they come around, can't wait to hear their new and remixed material onstage. I love Soul Boat, very smooth, very liberating. Spill the Wine-I'll take that pearl! Great lyrics with a soulfull voice and supporting rythyms make this one a well rounded CD."
1,NO PACKAGING FOR ITEM!!,"I ordered the salem powell daybed springs and was very surprised to see that there was NO packaging on item. The driver just took it out of the back of the truck and brought it to me, no wrapping or packaging what so ever. It was warped on one side but how could it not have been. Shame on you Amazon for not spending more money on a little packaging and support to send it to your customers. For 170.00 you should have taken the time and effort to keep faithful customers happy and confident in their buying from you."
3,Where's the Guru that I respect?,"Guru - you've really fallen off with this one. In the midst of all the depressing thug garbage what the hip-hop world needs now is a return to intelligent lyrics. Who can we look to for this? Maybe one half of the team that delivered the greatest hip-hop album of all time - ""Moment of Truth"". But no - what do we get - a lot of half-baked thuggisms and uninspired beats. Guru - you're diluting your output and it's not doing your rep any good. This album is naff, naff, naff. Guru - love you man and I know you're capable of much more than this. Get back with Premier and give us something of substance again."
4,leadin the underground,"Yet another hot underground LP from Mr. Guru. With producers like Premo (of course), Alchemist, Pete Rock, J-Love, and a handful of others, you know the beats are on point. The lyrics are definitly there with the king of monotone plus appearances by Boston collegue-Ed O.G., Ice T, Treach, Big Shug, and many others. Although it doesnt sound like classic Guru from the Gangstarr days, it still keeps your head boppin. Basically its just another niiceee guru album that makes you just wanna chill and take the vibe in...."
3,Great Album,"Great album. Hussein Fatal, James Gotti & New Child kill it. Guru is sick. He finally went solo & this album is fire"
3,I GIVE THIS CD A 3.5 STARZ!!!! WORTH TO CHECK OUT!!,"THIS ALBUM IS FOR HIP-HOP HEADZ AND HEADZ THAT ARE MORE MATURE AND UNDERSTAND THE THINGS THAT R OUT THERE IN THE WORLD. HEADZ THAT LISTENS TO GURU ARE THE HEADZ THAT HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO HIS MUSIC BACK YONDER(12-15)YRS AGO. I LOVE THIS CD BECAUSE GURU BEEN OUT FOR A WHILE AND STILL ABLE TO FIND IDEAS TO HIS MUSIC. NOW U HAVE THE CLICK THAT WERE ABLE TO SHINE ON THIS PIECE AND SOME OF THESE CATS ARE FRESH OUT THE BOX. COMING THRU WITH MESSAGES THAT ARE CATCHY AND HAVING PRODUCERS LIKE PETE ROCK, ALCHEMIST, DJ PREMIER AND OTHER BANGING PRODUCERS HOW CAN U GO WRONG. COP THIS PIECE TRUE HIP-HOP HEADZ."
2,So Weak!,"This game is fun, oh yeah, but the software has a problem. In every ballclub you eventually get to a spot where the game dosent want to play anymore. It just stops. If you dont want to drop $45 and not be able to excange for a different game, even if its the same price, get MVP, it might not be as good, but its better in the long run. The graphics are almost identacle, also dont get games like this for ps2. If you have an xbox get it for that."
1,989 we have a problem,989 games always freeze and this one does to. Get 2k6 or the Show instead. It freezes so much it gets anoying!
3,The freezing really kills this game.,"When I first bought this game I thought it would be better than last years game, but i can't even finish 2 games in a day. Every single time i am having a great game and killing the other team it freezes. It usually occurs in the 7th, 8th, or 9th. In a season mode it always freees up on me so i can't try to win the world series or even win any games. Everything else in this baseball game is cool, but the freezing kills it so I would avoid this game and buy MVP Baseball 2005."
4,This game was awesome but it freezes to much,"I just bought mlb2006 its awesome! grapics are great so realistic the only problem i have is it freezes it usely freezes in eight or ninth inning or when someone gets hurt it usely freezes it also freezes when you try to bring in a pinch hitter this game is great but they need to fix the freezing glitches so people who have it right now should have it replaced, meaning that the creaters of the game should fix the freezing problem and replace it so i suggest you buy it when they fix the freezing glitches other than that the game was awesome!"
2,got boring after a couple of months,"It was an alright game, the only reason i havent been playing it was because in the carrer mode after you have a good season, no teams signs you for more than a year, and if you can get a team for more than one year, after the first year, you are not one the team, and that got annoying."
2,people are stupid,"whoever buys this game is not very smart, becuz MVP baseball 2005 is out there. MVP is way better than MLB in every aspect of the games, it beats MLB straight up. So do not get MLB 2006 and get your moneys worth and purchase MVP 2005. just do it. Oh yeah, i dont want to brag but i am like the best ever at NCAA Football 2005, which is also a great game, so buy it."
3,"Fun, except for a couple of things","Overall this game is pretty good, There are a couple things i dont like about it. One major problem that i had was that you cannot set your rosters how you want them, given the fact that you can ""trade"" players, you can't sign a player without giving someone up. I would have liked to update my roster to the newest season, and play games with a current roster, but you cannot use that roster in single games, so setting you roster is useless. Also the freezeing thing sucks, but i guess i am happy that i am not the only one experiencing that problem. Last thing i would have to say is the fielding is pretty bad, the outfielders look like they have to use the bathroom when they are chasing down a fly ball."
2,GAME FREEZE,"This game has nice graphics and pretty good game controls. The hitting is much too difficult, when not playing in Rookie mode. THE BIG PROBLEM!!! This game freezes toooooo much. I played 5 games in a row and every game froze, after a few innings. A real stat destroyer, when you have a good game going. I lost count of how many times I had to restart this game, playing in season mode.VERY DISAPPOINTED FOR THE MONEY I PAID, WHEN THE GAME WAS RELEASED!!!!! I HOPE 2007 IS BETTER!!!"
4,Best of the 3.,"It just feels more like baseball without all the candy and BS of the other 2. But can somebody out there PLEASE tell me howto edit, save and load a roster change? The instruction manual fails to say, other than it says changes you make can be used in any mode of play................but I can't do it.Otherwise I couldn't be more pleased. The game is a realisticsim, and that is always my preference with a sports game."
2,"Terrific Gameplay Style, Poor Stability",This game has to top all other MLB games on the market as of now. The system that 989 sports delivers in this edition is by far the best of all current games. The gameplay is smooth and the graphics are great. The only problem is that the game freezes! I have played my first 4 season games and each time they froze (earlier being in the 6th inning +) and I was leading each game. I believe that customers should be able to receive a fix for this game. If it wasnt for that - I would of gave this product 5 stars.
3,Warning!,"I thought 989 really released a good one here, until you play it for awhile. As mentioned in other reviews I have read, but feel it's important to repeat for those thinking of buying it, the game often freezes. And it waits until you've played 7 or 8 innings too. I've played about 20 games alltogether probaby (2 different game discs on 3 seperate consoles) and about 10 times it's frozen up on me. Also, the last 5 or 6 games I've played when you are fielding the ball and try to throw to a base it automatically throws to home plate, a little annoying. Until these problems occured it seemed like a great baseball game, but these are too big of problems to deal with."
3,way too big,I bought the small (after reading the reviews)for my 50 lb shepherd mix. It was WAY too big and we ended up with abrasions on her elbows. I'm searching for something in a smaller profile. What a disappointment.
2,small dog backpack review,"I consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds. I have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and I still feel like they are a little bit too big. I think that for a ""small"" backpack, that they are just too large. Thank you."
2,Didn't fit well,"I returned this item, as it didn't fit my 19-pound Boston Terrier well at all. It was way too large for his body. ""Small"" obviously means small for a larger dog instead. Just be aware!"
1,dog is injured after wearing dog pack,I have not read any of Ceasar Millan's book but a dog trainer has here in this small town where I am from.Her dog is a cattle dog and after using the bags with water in them to tire the dog out.. the dog was injured.I think people should be aware of using something like this on a dog for it could hurt a dogs spine for life.
5,Dog back pack,"This is a fabulous dog back pack/ saddle bag. It too less than a minute to fit the first time (although I was glad I read the reviews from others that it ran big) and it takes only a few seconds to put on and take off. My dog quickly adjusted to it and, just like Cesar Milan says on the Dog Whisperer, it really gives her a workout, which is great for a high-strung dog. It has a lot of space for carrying things, which is quite convenient for the dog owner. Overall, this was a great purchase with which I am very happy."
4,Good product for medium size dog,"My dog seems to be ok with this pack on his back. At first he tried to pull it off, but as with anything, treats and positive reinforcement work best!Holds up well, and carries everything we need for him on day trips."
5,Dog back pack,"The fit is great, the pack stays in place. he is a 100 pound Shepard. When the dog sees the pack in my hands he is very happy."
3,Not good for my car,My car has an antenna in the back of the vehicle and this transmitter was not strong enough to get a signal back there
1,It's not working more than 2 minutes,"In a summer day in CA, in the car is hot and this device is not working more than 2 minutes.(I have my AC on and is very strong). In the morning or the night was running fine for 30 minute.(the longest time that I drive). The quality of the sound is good to very good I was impressed, but is no useful as long is shut down. I returned to the amazon, I will try other brand."
5,THE BEST FM TRASNMITTER HANDS DOWN,"I have tried almost all of the other FM transmitters, and they suck. the sound goes in and out, its hard to change the station, they dont stay in the ciggerette lighter socket good etc... this one transmitts perfectly, the sound quality is way better than other FM transmitters i have use. the design is great, it is soo easy to use. if you need an fm trasnmitter, this is the one to get."
2,Died after two months,"This transmitter worked great. However, it broke after only three months. I was really dissappointed and can not imagine buying another one."
5,Worked great for me,"I bought these to listen to MP3 files in my vehicles. I live in a small town so conflicting signals from FM stations is not an issue. Did notice I might have to change frequency a few times while going through or around large metropolitan areas. I really like them (one for each vehicle at the time). They were reasonbly priced, worked well, and in general I found them very useful."
2,Convinced me to upgrade to auxiliary output,"When I got a car with a 6-disk CD player instead of a cassette player, I was a little concerned about this very issue. Unfortunately, this product worked so poorly most of the time that it pushed me get my next car with an auxiliary output because I was tired of struggling to use my iPhone in the car.Whether in a big city like Houston or Austin or driving out in the middle of nowhere Texas, the sound was never good and usually required trying to find a new frequency so often that it stopped being worth it.It hasn't physically broken in five years of having it, so I guess if you have better luck getting frequencies than I do, that could be a plus."
1,Iriver AFT 100,"This product worked great in my driveway. However, once on the road it was impossible to use. I travelled through 4 states and could not hold onto any blank stations. At 65 mph this item is useless. I would not recommend to anyone."
3,Works well enough,Gets the job done. Lots of static though. But I also live in Los Angeles where there aren't that mainly empty stations to find.
3,Works OK,The transmitter works pretty good most of the time. The only problem I am having is there is a short in the cord. So now I only hear volume from one of my car speakers. So now I have to move the cord around and hold it just right before I can hear both the left and right speakers. I bought this 2 months ago. Seems that this device should hold up better.
3,Great FM Transmitter except...,"While it's got a good, clean signal and the memory buttons are convenient, this transmitter has a non-defeatable auto power off function when it doesn't get an audio signal for 60 seconds. It then takes it about 15 or 20 seconds to power up after getting a signal again. It drives me nuts, so I've relegated this to use in my wife's car when I forget to grab the Irock 450FM from my own."
2,worked for two days and later died on me,"the transmitter worked fine for a couple of days and later died on me.loose contact with the cigarette lighter outlet.i pop it into the outlet and it doesnt power up.so,stopped using this....for a while now....i dont recommend this product.there are many other better products for the same price...."
1,Critical Design Flaw,"The transmission quality of this transmitter is excellent, but before you spend $45 of your hard-earned cash, you need to know this unit has a critical design flaw in the internal insulation of the stereo transmitter wire that will pretty much guarantee you only get about 6 months of problem-free use and about 9 months absolute life-time before it shorts out or you lose a channel of audio. The internal insulation of the wire is entirely too brittle, which means that the cable will very quickly break down under normal use far before the unit actually 'wears out'. Engineered obsolescence? Possibly...a more durable and pliable insulator coating could certainly have been used for pennies more in manufacturing costs.iRiver's warranty is pathetic at 90 days, so I'm not sure what recourse most users have other than to complain and not purchase this product. I have contacted iRiver about the defect and will provide an update based on the feedback provided."
2,Belkin TuneCast II FM Transmitter better...,"Short: The Belkin TuneCast II FM Transmitter offered better quality sound and the design is superior...I purchased two FM Tuners at the same time since they both had good reviews and I *really* wanted one to work on a long road trip. The first was this iRiver one the second was the ""Belkin TuneCast II FM Transmitter.""We wound up using the Belkin exclusively. The sound quality was much higher and the fact that it was on a long cable meant we could put it on the dash right next to the antenna to increase both the volume and quality yet further still.They both plug into the car's power supply, but this one is far larger blocking a drinks-cup holder too.So I would recommend the Belkin one over this iRiver tuner, but that being said you can do far worse than this one (as the Griffin iPod specific one I had before was yet worse still).They both only support a very limited frequency range however (less than our car's stereo)."
2,Limited range...again.,"My radio antenna is located on the rear of the car. I assume this is the reason why there is so much static. However, the stated broadcast range should have covered the distance, hence the low rating. The cheaper Belden transmitter I wanted to replace actually worked better than the iRiver. At least I could wave it around the car until the signal came in; the iRiver's cigarette lighter location cannot be changed. For those of you with the same problem, our best solution is to go down to the car stereo shop and either get a system with an aux input or have them modify your existing radio to accept a cable connection."
1,How can 500+ reviewers like this piece of junk?,"Extremely poor reception. Tried in friend's car and also was horrible. However, a different brand my friend purchased at Radio Shack works fantastic (fraction of the cost). With so many good reviews I thought mine must be a lemon, but then I read reviews from others that had exchanged theirs and experienced same problem. Get this, here is my bad, I trusted iriver brand so I tossed the box, receipt, etc...consumer naiveté and brand trust I guess! Anyway, now I hold a worthless piece of junk and to make matters worse am left baffled by taking guidance from overwhelming positive reviews? Could primary distributors pushing a huge inventory of high margin pieces of junk hire folks to flood positive reviews?! ;-) Yikes, I trully hope there is no truth to that! Anyway, baffled and now I get to eat 50 bucks...yippee."
1,"bad design , will not work in cities","It works in Steamboat Springs,CO. I tried and failed to use it on a trip to NY 1. frequncy #'s not visable in many cars, Very poor reception where a lot of stations exist. It worked but poorly in Denver. for a few dollars more they could have placed station display in a better location or even put a flexible neck on it."
2,Only worked in the garage,"Was initially excited at the clarity of this setup, but then pulled out of garage and experienced quite a bit of static. Tried a wide array of frequencies to no avail."
4,good overall,I have used this in Metro DC with only limited problems with interference or noise. It probably works and sounds as good as a device of this type/price is going to.
5,Best FM transmitter you can find!,"After testing various other FM transmitters and deciding that they were all junk, I had the fortunate opportunity to use the iRiver. Now my mind is changed. This item restored my faith! Other transmitters failed because my car (2004 Honda Accord EX) has a rear integrated antenna set-up. Contrarily, the iRiver works with an undistinguishable sound quality from that of my CD player. I've haven't had any problems with interference either. There are three programmable presets that allow you to set various frequencies if you travel in and out of different radio programming area, although I still only need to use one. My only complaint is it doesn't charge my ipod during use. I can get by with out it since short trips will only mess up my battery. Check this item out before you spend unneeded cash on the more expensive units or options."
5,Nifty gadget,"Automobile FM transmitter is very easy to use with any device that has a headphone jack. Sound quality through my car speakers is equivalent to reception from a good FM station. The sound sometimes breaks up a bit on high frequencies, but I'm not sure if that's the fault of the FM transmitter or of my various audio output devices. The iRiver lets you choose any FM frequency and allows 3 presets. I rarely, if ever, get interference on my #1 preset, but it's nice to have the option to change frequencies."
4,My best friend... until it died.,"I really loved this iRiver FM Transmitter. It is easy to use and gives pretty good sound. Since my car doesn't have a CD player, this thing was a godsend! You should only consider transmitters that transmit on all frequencies and that do not need batteries, like this one. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that after a year it died. I liked it enough to get a replacement and I noticed in reviews for different brands that some of those only made it a few months."
1,Not very reliable,"The sound from the first transmitter I received would cut out every 30 seconds. The replacement transmitter worked only OK for about 2 months then began cutting out every 30 seconds. By cutting out, I mean the sound would mute for about a second and then resume playing for another 30 seconds."
1,Just Me?,"I can't comment on how the actual product works as the slightest bump causes it to come loose from the outlet. The outlet can't be that loose as the lighter needs a strong pull to come out. I drive a 1999 Saturn SC2, if that helps."
3,Very good if you have to use an FM Transmitter...,"But if you have a tape deck or direct jack to your car radio use that instead! Comes in very clear most of the time and it's great that you have the full FM spectrum to use, not like cheaper ones that limit you to only a few choices."
4,Pretty good though minor static,"In my area, there is hardly any clear frequencies to tune in to. The clearest frequency I could find was 99.5. After tinkering with the volume on my Zune, the sound quality improved with less static, but it's still noticeable. Although not as great as cd audio, I'm willing to sacrifice sound quality in order to play over 2000 songs. It's alot more convenient than burning 100+ CDs. I like the auto-off feature. So far, it hasn't shut off during playback as some have reported. The preset feature is also handy as I don't have to frequency surf every time. The only con I can think of is it uses the 20v cigarette lighter. A bluetooth version of this would be awesome."
2,Good until it died...,"I've owned this transmitter for a year now with no problems, until about a month ago. For some reason, the music is only coming out of the left front and rear speakers of my car. I know it's not my MP3 player because I've tried it on several MP3 players, and it's not my car because it does it in all the cars I plug it in. Glad I only payed $5 for it on Woot."
2,Does not last,"I researched this product for a while before buying. I read other reports of people who had this product stop working, but for some reason I took the chance and bought it anyway. It worked fine at first, but it no longer works. It turns off after a few seconds and will not stay on. This is probably a hit and miss, but unfortunately I got a bad one. I have another FM transmitter, that cost only 10$ and it has worked for years. This product was a disappointment for me."
4,iriver rocks,I purchased this item after my old FM Transmittr just stoped working.I did try a few others that worked OK but when I got in the city the sound was well #$&^%.This thing works well in DFW and out in the country.
4,is ok,"I bought this for my car because the iphone fm transmiter were to expensive, but it works fine, but sometimes it turns off even if you are playing the music, if you dont have it conected to your iphone or ipod it will turn off as well I guess to save energy, I will say for the price I paid for it, it works well..."
4,IRiver Transmitter,The digital feature makes it very easy to use when your driving on this product. I liked it when I got it but ended up breaking it don't know if I mishandled it or if it was just fragile.
4,"Simple to use, could brodcast stronger","The unit is very easy to hook up and use.My 2 issues* radio broadcast steps are by the "".1"" where as all north american brodcast radios tune by the "".2"". Makes for lots of extra button pushing when tuning to an empty station* broadcast strength could be stronger, even far off stations are able interfere with this unit when it is a mere 6"" from the radioThe unit itself is solid I expect it to las for a long time."
2,"When it works it works ok, but when it doesn't, well!","I searched and reviewed looking for an fm transmitter for my mp 3 player. Ended up getting an iriver. Have to say that it is more frustrating than it is helpful. Turns itself off more than it stays on. I have tried many different volume adjustments, to no avail. When it does work it seems to work well with very little static if any, but then again, that's only when it actually stays on. Ya know, I would not recommend!"
5,"Simple, easy to use, and does the job","I did a little shopping around and comparison of makes and models. I never purchased a similar item before. This model turned out to be the perfect solution. It was very reasonably priced and is very easy to use. I bought it for my wife to use with her mp3 player. It usually takes a few training sessions before she knows how to use most gadgets, but she was able to use this with very little instruction. If you find that sound reproduction is less than optimum, simply dial in a new FM frequency and it should cure the problem."
2,Little FM Transmitter,This little unit is sturdy little all in one unit which transmits your mp3. I have purchased several of the Griffin products and they all failed me after a month. And this unit failed me after about 2 months as well. Not worthy of your time and effort.
4,"Works well, even in the USA","I'm using this transmitter in Brisbane, Australia, where the fm spectrum is not as crowded but I collected it in the USA and used it there with great results. This is the third (affordable) transmitter I've owned. The first failed very soon after it came out of warranty. The second is still working but I'm not happy with the sound quality, in fact very unhappy. The iriver AFT100 is a gem. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
3,"great, but dies","the good news, this is a great transmitter that broadcasts a more powerful signal than the belkin, battery powered unit. even in a major metropolitan area, this transmitter was able to come through clearly.the bad news, my unit died after about yr. the transmission started to cut in and out. i'm sad that i lost this unit because when it was working, it was excellent.unfortunately, there's not much to choose from b/c it seems that all FM tranmitters are average or subpar."
3,It does the Job,It isn't the greatest. It is nice that you can choose any radio station to tune in b/c if none worked then you would just be stuck with static. But it can be a pain trying to find it initinally. Once you find it though it does remember that station. It does stink with low music it will go into sleep mode. The best quality is when your mp3 player volume is set to middle range but then it limits your sound in your car. It works so not all complaining. But I was hoping it would be better.
1,Don't bother...,"Maybe it's because I live in a highly populated area with many radio stations, but I found it impossible to find a clear channel to sync the transmitter to without hearing background noise- I've already ditched the product."
5,The best out there !,"This FM transmitter is the best out there,* Full Band.* 3 presets.* great price* amazing quality and purity* compact design.* fits for all standard mp3 players.* better than the special ipod fm transmitter (tested it myself)***sometimes it heats up after a long time of operation, so it turns off by itself (self protecting technique), but soon enough it gets back to action."
4,Hitting the Mark,Read previous reviews and was recommended to this product. Found it to be the best thing to happen to my MP3 player. Works great with my Creative labs Jukebox Zen Xtra.Very happy with the device - looking forward to many years of great music in my car...
3,mediocre performance,"I have used cassette adapters. After setting up the iriver adapter, I plugged both a cassette adapter and the iriver into the 2 output plugs on my mp3 player. That way I could flip back and forth. The cassette adapter had a better dynamic range, and the iriver's reception seemed a little flakey."
2,"Sounds Good, Auto-Off Feature Annoying","This product sounds great, it's easy to set up three different stations, which is convenient. The auto-off feature seemed like a good idea, but during quiet passages in the music, it would suddenly turn itself off. For instance, you can't listen to Pink Floyd's ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"", or many other musical selections that don't have a constant pounding base to keep the AFT-100 aware that the music is still playing. It simply won't stay on.For that reason, I don't use the AFT-100 anymore. If I could find a modification to disable the auto-off feature, it would be ideal."
4,Good product,"I am using this product in Bangalore, India and it works great. We don't have many FM channels in Bangalore so there is no interference. I have used this in the Portland, OR and Seattle, WA area; I had to keep shifting between frequencies to avoid interference. The three button presets comes to rescue and work great. I see a drop in low end bass audio frequencies. However, I highly recommend this product."
3,Decent,"I kind of have a hard time using this bad boy. It often takes quite a bit of fiddling with the stations and the volume on both the radio (too high and you get ambient station noise) and the Mp3 player (too high and you get crackling). Also, if I lived in a bigger city (I'm in Denver) it might be next to impossible to find an available station. But, when I do get it to work, it's fantastic, and I think if I didn't insist on listening to my music loud enough to shake the ground I would hardly have any trouble at all."
3,not the best transmission,the transmission frequency is not that great. u lose quality on the sound using this device. i guess this is expected. nothing beats a direct connection to your stereo. so i would suggest you pay more and have a device directly connected to your car stereo if you care on quality sound.
2,This thing sucks!!!,"It worked great the first week of using this transmitter, but now it fades in and out and completely turns off after a couple minutes of use. It's extremely frustrating. I should have just gone and bought one from an electronics store. Now I have to go and purchase another one because this one sucks!! Very disappointed!!"
3,It is okay,"The item works, but does experience distortion of sound at a high enough volume. as expected of FM transmitters. there are not really any problems besides one. the device keeps turning off of its own accord. it is understandable if the mp3 or CD player does not play any sound for a while. other than that this product works as expected."
1,It sucks,It worked ok for the first two times but the sound quality was poor. Starting with the third and last use...it would stop working and shut down after about 60 seconds. Going to send it back. Don't buy it!!!!!!
3,Decent Product For The Price,"I use this product soley for playing my MP3 player in the car. This is a good product for the price especially versus what is available in retail stores. You have to set the volume up louder than your radio or CD volume and the sound quality isn't quite as good. If your auto has a cassette player, purchase the cassette converter. It's easier to use.The only problem is if you travel and you go through areas where there is traffic on the frequency you have set, you will have to search for another low traffic frequency.All in all; a good product."
4,Mobile transmitter,"This product works like they claim it should. I can listen to my iPod in the truck, which is a plus when listening to audio books. The only downside that I have found is that there is a slight background noise, but not bad enough to worry about."
1,"Didn't work, bad setup","The product that was shipped to me didn't work at all, so I obviously returned it right away. Even if it wasn't a lemon, the FM screen is impossible to read. Since it is directly on the part that plugs into the lighter, I literally had to put my head on the passenger seat to read which station it was on. Bizarre, the only way this would be convenient is if you have a lighter at eye level."
3,Wish it worked better,"I like the ability to program 'blank' station presets in this thing but it's performance is sometimes very sketchy. It will sometimes just drop the input signal, resulting in a lot of amplified noise coming through the speakers. This can be very annoying if you're in the middle of a favorite song. I also find that I have to move my mp3 player around in the car to find an optimal spot to reduce background noise...usually above the passenger visor works. The presets are also a bit hard to see on sunny days as my cigarette lighter is mounted lower in the console."
4,Works great!,"After purchasing a cheapo RadioShack transmitter and finding it more or less unusable, my expectations were pretty low. But as I was about to go on a cross country drive, I needed something to hook my Nomad onto the car stereo and chose this one, based on the good reviews.And I was not disappointed!Of course I had to do some frequency adjustments on the way, but I found this to be as good as it gets. Good sound (radio quality, not CD quality, thus 4 instead of 5 stars), and easy use made my 4-day drive a pleasure!!!"
2,Does Not Hold Up,"I have had two of these transmitters and both broke after 6 months. The power adapter for the car lighter broke on my first one and the second one frayed at the wires. AND I had recommended one to my friend and HERS broke before 6 months was out. So that was THREE! Needless to say, I moved on and purchased a completely different brand the third transmitter. Honestly, I just want to go out now and buy a radio with a jack so that I can avoid the hassle of the transmitter all together. If you live in a fairly populous area then you have a difficult time finding an empty radio band. The Belkin was good enough to use a radio band that was occupied but somewhat full of static. I was sad that both mine broke because I really liked the product otherwise."
4,It does what it should ...,"I purchased this item so I could stop carrying all those CDs around. Now I just plug in my MP3 and it works great over my car stereo. Of course, I may crack up my car trying to find songs on that little ipod screen but that's not the product's fault. I have tried others and this one works the best."
3,Good but only if you can find an unused freqeuency,"If you can find the right frequency this unit works well, the sound is clear with crisp highs good low frequencies. Unfortunately finding an unused frequency is not so easy because you may think that you have it figured out but then you drive to another part of town and you start to hear an annoying crackling sound caused by interference. It took me a long time to find a frequency that worked all around town, and if you drive to a different city you may have to find a new frequency which is not practical while you are driving. I thought that I would use it more but instead I just burn my mp3s to CD, which is more convenient and has a better sound quality."
2,Radio Interference,The sound quality of the product is pretty bad. I don't think it is a problem with the product itself but in the area where I live it is not possible to find a frequency that is clear enough for a good transmission. There's really no way of knowing this until you try the transmitter in the area in which you live.
1,"Great in theory, not in practice","I have to agree with the other reviewers who mention the 30-second shut-off feature. This is my second iRiver adapter, and both have died after about 9 months of usage because of the same thing - no matter what I do, it shuts off and won't power back on. Even if my iPod is turned all the way up, it still won't work. I'll be looking for another brand to replace this one this time."
5,Good,"After reading a number of conflicting reviews, I had no idea what to buy. CNET goes to the extent of saying they are not happy with the concept of FM transmitters. Eventually, I decided to take a risk and chose this model. My gamble paid off. I am using this transmitter in my car and am getting excellent reception. I stream through a channel which is in use by a local radio station and yet this transmitter comes out a winner with absolutely no noise.One minor problem is the charger plug needs to be pushed in to its maximum length or else it will come loose at times. However, once you position it correctly, you never need to bother with it again.Highly recommended!"
1,Yikes!,"This device is awful! I managed to find a few clear radio frequencies to use, and the resultant sound was okay although not stellar. I would have been content with that, but the device for whatever reason turns itself on and off when the frequency loses strength. I was lucky to hear 1/3 of a song, and the other 2/3 of the time I was being blasted with horrible static. I don't recommend buying this. I doubt I'll try another transmitter either; it was a pain to try to control while driving, and I don't have much confidence in the technology at this point. Am waiting for a better alternative."
4,I can hear,I purchased a Griffin itrip in Dec and have had problems with it since I got it. With this one I can actually listen to my ipod while in driving in the DC metro area. Good product wish I spent the money for it earlier.
4,Works Well,"PRO: Audio quality is better than most I've tried. Works with virtually all audio/mp3/iPod/iPhone/etc devices.CON: For extended use, you'll need a separate charging hook-up. Most iPod/iPhone radio specific devices provide playback + charging."
4,So far so good,"Pleased with this so far. Sound quality seems pretty good considering it is an FM signal. It doesn't have too much of an issue with interference, way better than the 10+ year old transmitter it replaced."
4,Not Bad For An Only Option,"If this is the only way to get an MP3 player to work in your car then go for it. Only the pickiest ears will be disappointed with the quality.Your songs will have that radio-feel to them, you know what I mean? That kind of sound that is clear enough to enjoy but is obviously radio quality.Bottom line: Your options are limited with older vehicles and even some of the newer ones, so if this is the last possible option for you then there's no reason not to get one if you really want your music in you car."
1,Don't do it.,"I use this with an ipod. In both of my vehicles, the unit continuously shuts itself off. Incredibly annoying. I returned the first unit thinking it was a lemon. The second does the same. I contacted I-River to no avail-no response. I dont get all of the positive feedback I am reading about it. Dont do it."
2,Transmitter not universally usable,This transmitter will not fit power plugs on my '01 and '04 Chev PU trucks. Made to fit a longer recepticle than my vehicles have. Buyer should check to see if they have the older and longer cigarette lighter plug before purchasing this item.
1,Unreliable,I bought the FM transmitter and it worked for about a week. I love my H10 but this product was very dissapointing. It continuously cuts out after about 30 seconds of playing at ANY volume level. I've given up on trying to get it to work and I'm dissapointed I can't return it. Not a good product.
2,Not Worth the money,I was very disappointed. It loses its connection frequently and the sound quality in the car is worthless.
2,This is lousy!!!,"After my Belkin tunecast II conked out after about a year or so, I decided to try this one because I liked how the unit plugged directly into the lighter and was less cumbersome than other models. Generally with FM transmitters, the audio quality is much better if you turn up the volume on your audio device. This iRiver model has static and distortion even with my iPod turned to a moderate volume level!! I'm constantly having to fiddle with the volume to get a clean sound and still be able to hear the song over my little VW engine. The Belkin could handle much higher volume input levels without distorting. Don't bother with this one - it's weak!!!"
4,Works well,Works as advertised. However I found the volume on the radio needed to be turned up more as compared to using a casette tape adapter.
1,Does not fit!,"It does not fit the lighter of our cars (one Japanese, one American)!!!!. This thing is too long compared with the depth of the average car lighter socket. Dont know what to do with it, any idea?"
4,Fine Product!,"Prior to purchasing this product, I was a long-time user of the digital Belkin FM Transmitter w/my Dell DJ30. When the Belkin transmitter went belly-up on me, I was going to purchase another one, but read the reviews about the iRiver transmitter. Decided to give it a try and I am very happy with the quality and the fact that I don't have to use batteries in the transmitter. The only thing that would have improved the iRiver transmitter for me is if it rotated someway so that the channel display and buttons were at the top since the cigarette lighter in my Jeep is at the same level as the gear shift, making it difficult to search for a clear channel when driving. Other than that, I'm a happy user."
2,Lack Luster,"I live in Atlanta, GA.I was excited about this product for a long road trip. The product did not stay locked on the same station for more than 10 mins. BAD Road trip."
4,"Gret Value, Cheapest Way to listen to ipod","I live in greater NYC, where the dial is very full. I found a couple slots, not entirely ideal, but it works. Not great sound quality, but acceptable.the price is very good for the item, considering the expensive other ways to hook in to a factory radio..."
1,IRiver product does not work -- sometimes! Argh!-update,"I purchased this item after reading reviews. Worked great the first time then it started turning off constantly. After unplugging and plugging back in it would work for a few minutes or maybe 20 min. then it would turn off! I wish it would not have the ""instant-on, auto-off"" ""feature"" as described in their instructions. Why can't it be ON when it's plugged in and OFF when you unplug it?! I emailed tech support at IRiver and have not received a response yet. I am dissapointed in this product for sure! If anyone knows the fix, please enlighten us!UPDATE: Returned product to IRiver and got a new one -- guess what SAME PROBLEM....it went out the window at 55MPH! Found a product that does not need batteries turns on when you push a button and works PERFECTLY. Truly a ripoff! Buyer BEWARE!!!"
2,Not Retail Package!!,"I have not had time to use the transmitter to comment on how it works, but I can comment on how the transmitter was delivered. When ordedring it I never saw anywhere where it said it was a bulk purchase item. I recieved it in a bubble wrap envelope without instructions. I contacted seller and was told it was clearly stated on Amazon that it is a Bulk item. I have read it over and over and still can't find where it talks about it being a Bulk item. It does say What's in the BoxAFT-100 mobile FM transmitter and instruction sheet. I did not get a box or instructions."
3,Automatic Turn Off Disappointing,"If no signal is received,for a brief time, this unit turns itself off. It seems that you have to unplug it and reinsert in car adapter to get it to turn on again. Also if a radio signal is detected it loses contact with your MP3 player. Would be nice if a power off/on button was included."
4,Does what you want it to,"Works well, although some loss of sound quality. In general, I'm happy with the product and have no complaints."
1,Broke after two uses,"I tried unplugging it and after the second time, the spring popped out along with a couple of other metal pieces rendering the unit useless. The cord to the mp3 player was already too short, and it simply isn't very functional. iRiver makes some great mp3 players but not accessories."
4,Good Product,"I've just receiveed the transmitter and test it in my car, it sounds good, it is small and because it could transmit in any FM frequency is very handly. Also, it has a friendly and ergonomic design. Of course, it is not perfect, i've found that if you are in an area very populated with many FM stations it could receive some peaks fron near stations, also it could receive any interference from cell phones nearby (just very near). Although the sound is very good, the only con is that you could hear a very small noise in high frequencies, like old tape systems. But this could mask with an adequate equalization. But, besides all, i guess that for the price is a good system, and i recomend it."
5,iRiver AFT 100 mobile fm transmitter,This product works very well to allow my MP3 player to play through the radio.
3,iriver AFT 100,"After scanning through the FM dial and finding the cleanest frequency, the iriver worked like a charm with little or no drift most of the time. The sound is pretty good and balanced in my Vibe's premium factory system.The Vibe/Matrix's 5 speed shift can be a problem in 1st gear when you grip the shifter with your whole hand and end up bumping the scan up/down button and you lose your preferred channel. No problems with the other gears.Good performance overall but would like a direct line into the head unit as a better solution."
2,Disappointed,"Bought the iriver AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter based on the favorable reviews here and elsewhere. Worked great on the I5 drive to SoCal but in the SF Bay area I am continually having problems with noise interference, especially when driving parallel to cable service running on telephone poles or when near high voltage transmission lines. Will probably try a cassette adapter-type interface next."
1,Worked well for 1 week,"I found the product easy to use and it worked well for 1 week. Now the unit turns off after a minute of listening. I unplug it, plug it back in and it works for another minute and the same thing happens.I got a lemon!"
4,Good quality for the cost,"Mine is in my second outlet in the arm rest since it is slightly closer to my low profile antenna in the back. Signal strength is moderate even with a not so great antenna. It may be best to expect some static here and there though. Since my tape deck started acting disgruntled about being used by a MP3 to cassette converter, it was my only viable option. I am quite pleased."
1,Used 2x - then it quit working,"Used this product twice, then it quit working. If you plug it in, it powers on for a second, then goes dead (no blue backlight). Quit working. Very disappointing, especially with *no warranty* from manufacturer (at least that I can find) and the seller only gives 14 days for a return for defective items."
1,Not worth the bucks,"I have used griffin itrip smart scan and this product for my ipod touch and the griffin product is way better in terms of sound quality, features and ease of use.The most annoying feature of this device is the auto shut off feature. If there is a noticeable gap in between tracks then it shuts off. It shuts off even for tracks that have a low volume.For it turn on again music has to be played for like over 20 seconds."
5,AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter,"Product works great!!! Great price too. When I looked in stores for this type of product, they did tend to be more expensive."
4,Nice Unit - Tyler,"I have owned one of these for a few years now and recently bought one for my girlfriend. This is one of the best out there for signal strength. I really like the unit and recommend, especially at this price compared to others at $50."
4,Great Product..,"I am thoroughly enjoying this FM transmitter, it works much better than several battery-operated models I've owned.."
4,Transmitter works,"This transmitter tends to be a bit pricey in stores, but thank goodness you can now find a few better deals online. I've used the iRiver transmitter with my iRiver H10 and it works well. Make sure you find a frequency that is not used by radio station for the best results."
1,FM transmitter,It broke after two uses. It has an auto shutoff if no detection after 30 seconds and I plugged it in to everything and it would shut off every 30 seconds. I was so mad I threw it out the window. What a waste of thirty bucks.
1,Worked great for 60 seconds...,"After that it would shut down, and not work, even when there was muci playing through it. I don't know if it was because I was using it with an adapter for a cell phone or what, but it did not work as advertised."
2,Quit working after 2 weeks,"This sounded great for the first 2 weeks, then all of a sudden, with no warning, it just quit working. We've tried switching frequencies and everything else. Very disappointed."
2,Strike 2,"I bought this to replace another transmitter that was working poorly in Metro Atlanta. This one is no better, with hiss and noise between/during tracks transmitted from my Zune to my radio, regardless of chosen frequency [and I have tried a great many, to no effect]. Don't kill the messenger, but if you are having troubles with your existing transmitter and hope to improve things with this one, save your money. I am beginning to believe that this is a commodity item, with only cosmetic and branding changes made by various ""producers."""
3,FM transmitter,This it the first product that worked for me in my car. I have to use other frequencies to make it work such as 95.1. The recommended 88.1 did not work. But I am finally satisfied. I use it with my Zen MicroPhoto.
2,not good at all,"This product is quite disappointing: it sometimes powers off itself without anyone touching it. Since at the same time, all other electronics plugged to my car are working without any problems, I have to say it is the FM transmitter's own problem."
5,"Works as expected, but may suffer from interference in urban areas","The transmitter works great in my garage and parking lots where there is no broadcast radio signal. Looks nice, has three preset buttons. However, in Los Angeles there is practically no frequency that does not have some signal and every now and then I hear static when using this transmitter while driving in town. I have purchased this device for use with an MP3 player on long trips, so, I suppose, interference will not be a problem outside the city where there is no broadcast radio signal."
5,Works Great,"Have had the iRiver for a month. Hard to find a FM station with no sound, but the iRiver overpowers whatever is playing on the stations! Cord is long, but it could be cut & spliced. Works very well for me and my Creative Zen. Good enough to get the 5 stars!"
4,Good for the price!,"I had previously bought another brand and had SEVERAL problems with it.. But with this particular transmitter you are able to pick the station you want to use, which is great if you live in a large city! I travel a lot and when I go to a larger city it still works! The only thing that sucks is that it's not 100% clear.. It's probably 98%, I mean you take what you get, it's a lot better than listening to the same old stuff on the radio!"
5,It works!,"I've tryed a few of these this is the first one that worked in NJ,(which has ever FM station in use) it worked on 90.3."
2,Not so good....,"Living in the SF bay area, I couldn't seem to get any reception without having either static, or the music was cutting out. Also, the device shuts off by itself and is hard to turn back on (you need to unplug the power, and plug it back in)."
2,Good Transmitter... While it worked.,"I had the AFT-100 for exactly 33 days before it stopped working. Worked fine one day, belly up the next. Nothing wrong with my MP3 player or car radio. I've tried it in several cars; the thing is dead. The retailer where I bought it only accepts returns for 30 days but I'm going to try to return it anyway. If not, we'll have to see how good iRiver's support is. If I can get this resolved to my satisfaction I might bump up to 3 or 4 starts. Disappointing."
3,it's okay,"the product sometimes seems it's not working or stop transmitting, but when it's transmitting the sound is not perfect even though it's a good product."
4,It Works,"I desparately wanted to listen to my favourite collections while on the move but I had no ways of playing mp3s in my car. But now, thanks to excellent performance of the transmitter, its been a pleasure driving my car while hearing to my favourite numbers from my discman. They also delivered it to me within a week despite opting for super saver."
2,Flat disappointment.,"We bought this for our Volvo XC90. This car (2003 model) has no known solution for inline connection to an MP3 player (not even a tape deck connctor.) An existing wireless solution did not work, and reviews seemed to indicate this iRiver product will do the job. It doesn't. The reception is poor at best, and the sound quality is awful. It may be interference in the location of the cigarette lighter in the front console, but that's where we needed it... we tried it for a couple of days, and had to let go."
2,Unreliable Device,"The iriver transmitter I bought initially worked well, but once in a while it would lose the signal from the ipod/mp3 player and create static and then come back again after a few minutes. Not sure what caused this, but it seemed as if it lost the signal feed and would shut itself down. The second complaint I have is that eventually the wiring malfunctioned and only one side of the speakers would receive a signal. Eventually the whole thing stopped working. I would search for another more reliable device."
3,iRiver AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter,"I read other reviews about the Iriver FM transmitter,so I decided to try it out.Overall it's good.I like all the choices you have on selecting different stations.I found one bad thing.When your mp3 player is playing songs and one song ends,in between tracks.The transmitter looses it's signal quickly and shuts off and you get this horrible static sound with a ear piercing sound as well.Maybe it's just mine?I feel like I sometimes don't want to bother with it because of this small problem."
4,Iriver AFT 100 Mobile FM transmitter,"I purchased this item December 28, 2009 and now (just over 2 years later) the wire that jacks into my mp3 player has finally shorted out. It was great while it worked. strong signal. i liked the power saving feature. Maybe I'll attempt to repair it."
2,Difficult Time Finding an Open Signal,"Are you kidding me? $150!!! I'd sell mine back for the $10.50 I paid for it two years ago. The trick to make this work was to find an open FM signal. Sounded easy, but even in the middle of Nebraska it was difficult. I found it easier to stick with my FM radio and built-in tape deck. In the meantime, this adapter just sits in my nightstand drawer gathering dust."
3,Good not great,"This FM transmitter puts out a decent signal, and if you have the volume controls right on your car and mp3 player, then you can reduce static to a minimum. There always does seem to be a bit of static, however, but you can override the noise if your music is loud enough. In any case, the product is okay but I would spend a couple extra bucks and get something more powerful next time."
4,Good Product,"If I hadn't lost it, I'd still be using it two years later. It is inevitable where I work that the vehicle doesn't have a tape deck, cd player, or an Aux out port. They always have an am/fm radio though. I work in rural Alaska where there are no radio stations, so this has gotten a lot of use."
5,Great Item,This product is terrific! The only drawback is when you get to a major city when you have too many stations and it is difficult to find a clear number where there isn't a station.
2,Unfortunate,"I was really looking forward to this product. I read a lot of good reviews about it, but it's not so good. The first time I used it, the sound quality was acceptable. But, suddenly it made a squealing noise and shut off. There was no way to turn it back on. I plugged it in 15 minutes later and it worked fora little while, but then it did the same thing and would not turn back on. I think it is worth it to spend a few extra dollars to buy the better equipment."
2,Worked great for 6 months,It worked great for 6 months and then it died with no warning. One morning it just would not power up. It held the station pretty good when it was working but there was one 5 minute section of my 20 minute commute where it always got stepped on by a powerful station broadcasting on the wrong frequency. Make sure you can find a station with just static for most or all of the drive if you intend to use it for a regular trip like to and from work.
4,Decent,"Worked pretty well, I found in my Nissan frontier the console plug in actually had better reception than the dash one. No static really so like i said works good"
5,Works great!,I wanted something relatively inexpensive that would work with any mp3 player and this product fits the bill. It works great and without having to turn up the volume really high. I suspect it would work even better if the radio antenna were closer to the front of the car but I am very happy with this purchase as is.iriver AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter
3,Great FM transmitter - one built-in drawback...,"While this is probably one of the best (for the price) FM transmitters for iPods and other MP3 players, it has one feature that needs work. There is an auto shut off feature that shuts the transmitter down if it thinks there is no music for 30 seconds or so. The problem for me is that I play quite a bit of instrumental music with soft quieter interludes that cause it to shut down... When it turns off, it makes a very loud (scary) sound and you need to pull out the plug and push it back in to get it to reactivate...or turning up the sound to a much louder level will also cause it to reactivate. I bought mine over 12 months ago, so things may have improved. Overall it's a great little gadget and I can deal with this. But I would have loved it if it didn't do this."
2,Just Wasn't Happy With This,"I usually don't return many things to Amazon, but this was one i did. There was virtually no setup, which was nice and it is compact. I also liked that it connected into the power plug in the car. My problem was it just wouldn't play a song for very long. Once i had my MP3 player hooked up to it, it would play for about 2-5 minutes but after that it would go to static. Or it would have this annoying ""sound"" over the music. I think i tried virtually every channel, but i just had no luck. I ended up getting the Belkin transmitter and it works much better. Not sure if it was just my radio channels or what, but i just didn't have much luck."
2,Pretty Dissappointing,"I bought the iriver mobile transmitter hoping that i would be able to listen to my mp3 player through my radio. I like the fact that it is easy to use and that you can choose your station, but i live in monroe and we get stations from toledo and detroit, which is a problem because most or all of the stations are occupied or have interference and the transmitter is not strong enough to block out the slight interference from far away stations. I didnt think to check to see how many stations i could use for this product, looking back, i should have. i would only recommend this transmitter if you live somewhere that there aren't many stations that you can listen to on the radio"
2,"Flimsy, keep your receipt.","This product did its job well for about four months. Then I had to fiddle with the wire coming from the part that goes into your vehicle in order to get sound out of both speakers. After a week, I got no sound. Not very durable.As for when it worked, it was fine. Just realize you need an FM channel that has nothing on it for it to work without hearing any static at all."
1,iRiver AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter Review,My unit was defective so I had to return it. I would only work on one of our three vehicles. I suspect it was not able to work on the vehicle's power system voltage levels although the vehicles were relatively new (2001 and 2004).
3,if possible buy a cassette player,"this may not be a product, but FM transmitter are not a good way to hook one's mp3 player, just does not beat the cassette player + adapter."
3,Functional... that's all,"It will not overwhelm you with it's carity. But, it is functional. Nice feature with the 3 presets. However, it does not add to the ""quality"" of what it is supposed to do. If you don't mind hearing MINIMAL background noise then this is what you are looking for."
2,Much more distortion than I expected,"I've tried putting the transmitter several places, and varied the volume of the input, and fiddled with various frequencies. The signal is strong, but the sound quality is weak. A regular cassette adapter has much higher sound quality."
5,"Works great with my iPod, even in San Francisco","This little FM modulator actually works well, even in an area with crowded radio spectrum such as San Francisco. Unlike some other modulators by Monster, Belkin, and Griffin, the AFT 100 lets you select ANY frequency, not one of a few factory presets. I simply found an empty frequency on my radio, adjusted the AFT 100 to match, and it sounds great, with no discernable noise or interference. Auto power-off is a nice feature, since I tuck my unit out-of-sight in the armrest.I use this device with both my iPod Photo and my iRiver IFP-890T. It's convenient and works well. Recommended!"
3,"Good product but when broken, useless","I read the many good reviews for this product, in that it worked great in the Chicago city with really good audio quality. I read one review that stated that theirs broke in a matter of months. I disregarded it, seeing as there were so many good reviews only to find that mine broke within a few months as well. It's been in the same car the whole time, no damage, it just suddenly stopped working.Hopefully you will not run into the same problem."
2,"Good Design, Poor Performance","In suburban New York City, the transmitter is essentially unusable, as it is subject to a great deal of interference on all channels. For whatever reason, my iTrip performs much better. On the other hand, the design on the iRiver is better -- there are three easily set presets, and one does not have to fumble with the iPod to control the device, as one must with the iTrip."
5,So much better than belkin...,"I'm not sure whether its the proximity to the radio, or what. This transmitter is Amazing. Even in urban settings there is no interpherance. This is my third transmitter and by far the best. No engine noises, no static, and no batteries to worry about. The only thing I find annoying is the auto-shutoff feature. If the source signal is too weak, or there is an especially long pause the transmitter will shut off. I think its a 30 second timer. It should have been a minute, or two."
1,Not pleased at all!,"We received our transmitters and it was very easy to operate. However, the sound quality was poor at best. I do live in the Houston area and there are tons of FM stations in use so finding an in between spot to use the transmitter on was quite a task. When we did program in a few blank stations the sound was good for a moment and then as soon as the car began to move it would go in and out. If I pulled along side a pick up or 18 wheeler it was all over the place with static and multiple things bleeding through. I don't know that this is a product issue or a major metropolitan radio issue. I did return the 2 we purchased since they served no purpose at all for us. Maybe in a smaller town they would work fine. Who knows!"
2,Bad Plug-in,"Plug-in is old style, won't work in all 12 volt adapters in your car/boat. FM signal is weak."
4,Great Product.,The 3 programmable presets are a must have if you live in or around a city. Otherwise you would spend all your time searching for a channel that isn't in use and synching up your radio. I have the 3 presets on the transmitter matched up with 3 presets on the radio. When one signal starts to pick up interference 2 clicks and your mp3 player is back in business. I have it hooked to my Sprint Treo 650 and works well.
2,Worked for six months,"When it did work....still got a lot of static. I would take the wire and hang it off my rear view mirror just so that I could get good reception. After six months, it stopped working. I am trying to return it under warranty...but may just buy a different unit altogether.Wouldn't recommend."
4,Good sound quality,"The iRiver AFT 100 is better then other FM Transmitters I have tried before. It's powerful and the sound quality is good with a wide sound frequency range. The only problem is when I try to listen to quiet part of a music like a progressive rock: the device activates its auto-shut-off feature and there is no option for turning it off. However, if you don't listen to progressive rocks or classic musics you don't need to worry about it."
3,Limitations,"While the packaging and insert says ""Transmits on full FM spectrum"" (88.1MHz-107.9MHz), the FM spectrum goes lower than 88.1 MHz. The best unused frequency I found in the Southern NJ/Philadelphia area is at 87.9, which this device does not provide. I could only find one other unused frequency, and I always have some static interference there (100.9 MHz). I could overlook the inability to use 87.9 if they hadn't stated ""full FM spectrum"". Device also says it shuts off when no input detected from your MP3 player, however it still looks like it is slightly illuminated. I therefore feel it must be unplugged from the cigarette lighter when not in use, though the literature does not address this sufficiently."
2,"spans spectrum, spectrum full, unit fails",This unit spans the FM spectrum; in a metro area where the spectrum full; the unit fails. Bottom line is don't buy this or any other FM transmitter if you are going to try and use it in a large metro area where all the FM frequencies are so closely space that there is not one of them open for the unit to work. If on the other hand you live in a remote area (like the desert) well then go right ahead.
1,Shuts down after 30 seconds!!!,"My buddy and I each got one and both have the same problem - the device shuts down after 30 seconds of normal operation, even though our MP3 players are cranked up to full volume to prevent it from turning off (according to the manual). iRiver support email bounces back an error and no one picks up their support phone line. Be wary!!!"
2,tons of interference in DC area + major annoyances,"I haven't tried competing products, and I don't doubt that thisproduct is better than competing products, but I do know that,compared to using an ""Aux"" jack on a car stereo (which,unfortunately, few car stereos have), this really sucks.I commute from WV to DC. Sound quality is fine from WV to Dulles.Any closer to DC (Reston, Fairfax, Falls Church, etc.) and theinterference makes for TERRIBLE sound quality. I have tried everyFM frequency multiple times.The auto shutoff idea would be a good one, if it gave you anycontrol at all. The problem is, you can not turn it off. Soif you pause your player for one minute, like to order foodfrom a drive-through, to look at a map, to answer your cell,this thing will time-out and your car stereo will blasts static.EXTREMELY annoying. Same if you turn on your car before youhit ""play"" on your player. Sit in your card and turn the keyand you are greeted with blasting static."
1,Intermittant Transmission,"FM transmission is intermittent, one second perfect stereo, the other barely audible. Before returning the device the first time, I tried it in two different cars (Ford/Honda) thinking it might have to do with the alternator, but each with the same result. I ensured that the signal from my mp3 player was working properly, since I tested it with headphones. The car radios also work properly when listening to radio, tape, or CD. After receiving the replacement I experienced the exact same problem. This time I even tried a third car. Same result: intermittent transmission of FM signal.Unfortunately it is easier to exchange the device than trying to find technical support. Consequently I have no idea what the problem is. I returned the second device and will try a different brand, too bad, since the sound was excellent for each second I was able to hear it...what a tease!"
2,Meh,"This is my first FM Transmitter and I can't say that I'm too pleased with it. It works, but most of the time I'm hearing a fuzzy noise with the songs. If you pause your player for more than 20 seconds it starts emitting a high pitched noise and then cuts out to the static of the unused FM station. I just ordered a different transmitter, so hopefully it'll be one that doesn't have the fuzzy noise."
2,Did not work for me,"I am giving this product a low score because it did not work. The extra star is because I bought the product from Buy Accessories and I expected it to be in a brand new package which it wasn't. It could be possible that even though I paid for a new product that I was shipped a used product that did not work. With that in mind it is possible that the product may very well be a great product but I was an unlucky buck.For me,the product did not work from the beginning. The blue light turned on, but the numbers never showed and after a few seconds the light slowly dimmed into nothing. I ended up buying a tune fm transmitter which was cheaper and works fine [...]"
2,Good until it lasted,"I was very satisfied with iriver, but it only lasted two days. After that the unit would shut off while it was playing. I would turn it on again and it was good forn another 1.5-2 min and it would shut off again. After another two days of this nonsense I returned the item for a refund. It could have just been a bad unit, but I am not willing to try again. Not after I lost $10 in shipping charges."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this transmitter to go with my Zen Touch after all the glowing reviews here. It does work, I'll give it that, but the transmission is sketchy and prone to static interference, and the volume just isn't satisfactory. I have to turn my head unit up several clicks louder than normal which yields a deafening surprise when I'm done with the MP3 player and want to switch back to regular radio. What can I say, it works but not as well as I expected it to."
4,Excellent so far...San Diego,"I have been using the iRiver AFT 100 for a couple days in the San Diego area and it is very solid. It took about 30 seconds to get it up and running with little or no directions. Unless you are an audiophile, the sound quality will be better than expected. For those with discerning tastes, go ahead and spend a couple hundred dollars for a direct line in, otherwise spend the $35 and be more than happy. Combine this with my XM radio and I don't want to leave my car!!!!"
3,"Nice, but has one major flaw.....","I've used this transmitter for about three months now. Overall, it's a very good unit: good signal strength, minimal RF interference.The problem with this unit is the auto-off function. If you listen to music with a wide dynamic range (something with extended quieter sections of music), the transmitter interprets this as a lack of input signal and shuts off after 30 seconds or so - in the middle of the song. This little ""feature"" makes the unit pretty worthless to me (I listen to a lot of jazz and indie rock) as it restricts what music I can load into my iRiver and listen to while driving.If all you listen to is loud, fast, average corporate music, this is probably the best transmitter for you to purchase; for anyone else, consider hardwiring options (car stereo w/aux input, cassette adapters, etc)."
2,Can't understand 5 star reviews,"I can't understand the awestruck 5 star reviews. It's good it fits in the 12V socket and spans the frequency spectrum. But at medium MP3 player output, there's loud hissing (remember the sound of a Dolby tape in a non-Dolby player?) over the car speakers. With the MP3 output turned higher, the hissing is minor, but there was a lot of snapping and crackling around the music peaks. Does this mean I have a bad out-of-the-box Iriver unit? The device was also sensitive to the position of the MP3 player and a lot of crackling if the electric socket adapter moved a hair with car movements. it may be better than most of the competition but if this is about the best, then we should think about getting car tuner/amplifiers with a little socket for direct line input. Of course, that won't help if you travel alot in rental cars, then you're back to this device."
5,Just as expected,"I had read the reviews here, before buying this product. I am glad that the product is functioning just as expected.I was concerned that the transmitter might not just fit into my cigarette lighter, as it looked bulky in the photographs. But, in reality it is very small and light. I have added some images of the AFT 100 attached to my cigarette lighter.The transmitter produces little or no static, except if you move the connecting audio cable a lot, while playing. The ability to set any desired frequency is very good. I have set it at 88.1 and never have had any interference."
1,Junk,"Reception is horrble, the cheap little cassette adapters work much better than thi unit. Tried it for a while then tossed it in the trash"
1,Not Very Powerful,"It's not powerful enough and only delivers mediocre quality even in areas with little radio activity. It works, but not great. Just pay an extra $20-$30 for a better one."
2,Wasn't my favorite,"Maybe it was my car (which has the antenna built-in to the back glass) or the city in which I live, but I didn't have much luck with this. Maybe better in less populated areas."
1,Just Static,"Maybe it depends on where you live because this thing did not work for me. I tried every radio stations and none of them worked, all I could hear was static. Amazon took it back without any trouble at all though."
1,Horrible sound quality,"The transmitter is not powerful enough, therefore the sound quality is horrible. I previously had the Coby CA-745 Wireless FM Car Transmitter, but it died after 2 years. I wanted to try other transmitter and the comments for this transmitter were good, but when I tried, I was so disappointed. I will buy the Coby CA-745 Wireless FM Car Transmitter again."
4,good product,"I have been using this transmitter in my car for over a year now. Overall, I am pretty happy with the performance. The only problem I have faced with the product is that occasionally the product drops FM connection when sound level of a song I am inputting to the transmitter is low - which is understandable, but I would rather hear beeping tones warning me of low audio input power level than hear white noise on my car speakers."
2,poor performance,"The Iriver AFT 100 worked well for one day and then I started to get distortions. These distortions were in most of the music I listened to, and changing the FM frequency didn't help. In the end I bought the Monster RadioPlay 300. I am happy with that unit."
3,Decent if you don't have an aux input,"If you don't have an aux input in your car, you'll need an FM transmitter. This is a decent option. It sounds fine and is easy to operate.However, it has an annoying tendency to turn itself off when there's a quiet passage in your music or if you're picking a new podcast, for example. It only takes about 20 seconds of quiet. I'd much rather it stay on permanently, or at least have an on/off switch. I don't think there's been a single occasion in which I have the transmitter installed but I don't want it to transmit."
2,Static and skipping,"I wanted to think that I could find a station with little interference but after spending over an hour (cumulative) I couldn't find a station and enjoy static-free music or audiobooks. If I had to do it over again, I would get a cassette adapter or if they make CD adapter that one. The signal in these small transmitters is to weak to work as good as radio. If you do buy a transmitter compare the signal strength before choosing."
3,ok product,it transmits but you have to play with the location of the transmitter so you don't hear static.
2,Doesn't fit!,"It doesn't fit into the car charger correctly. Every time I take my hand away from it, it turns off because there is no power, then you have to go back and find the station you are on. Horrible purchase!"
5,Works like a charm,"I bought the iRiver AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter a few months ago so that I could play my Pogo digital recorder through my Jeep Cherokee's FM radio. It has performed exactly as advertised. The hook up couldn't be easier: Just plug the mini-jack from the iRiver into the headphone output of the device you want to play then plug the iRiver into the cigarette lighter plug of your vehicle, tune the radio to match the iRiver frequency (it's fully adjustable) and your ready to go. The strength of signal is excellent. Kudo's to iRiver!"
4,Works gr8,Works gr8. I checked all the amazon reviews befre buying this and this works cool. Hardly there is any noise and it has a sufficient range to find a free radio channel.
1,Only static.....avoid avoid !!!!,"I purchased this after reading all the reviews online. I expected this to work well in my 3 series.But was a SUPER let down. I also tried it in my wife's Corolla. Was'nt much better. Tried every single frequency, different times of the day at different locations- almost 5 towns in MA.But there was ONLY static NO music. I also tried the Monster connector which works a lot lot better.Disappointed with this purchase !!!!!!"
1,iriver aft fm transmitter,"I like the iRiver transmitter's size & ease of use, etc., but the thing just doesn't transmitt to the radio very well. With music it is fine, but when music with lyrics are included it doesn't sound very good...get ""static-ey"" on words that have an ""s"" in them...weir. All in all, I would not recommend the product."
1,You get what you payed for.,"I had read some reviews and although I've known a radio transmitter to be poorer quality, I was excited to know that you could set your own radio station which I hoped would help alleviate problems I've had in the past.Well It didn't, even on a station that was completely not in use by any neighboring stations the sound quality was abysmal. Even if there was some music to be heard the static was so overwhelming that you couldn't understand the music anyways.If you have to do an FM Transmitter then fork up the 50 bucks and get one with at least decent quality, cause this is a POS."
3,Great for rock music only,"This product works pretty darn well as far as FM transmitters go. The sound quality is pretty good, and with digital tuning, the signal quality is nice.What this product sorely messes up is the automatic turning off ""with no audio signal."" If you listen to anything that is does quiet, jazz, classical, etc., this will shut you off in the middle of a piece, even though it is clearly transmitting music to the stereo at that time. This function needs to be removed, or be able to be switched off. I can have my MP3 player set at full volume, and this POS will shut off on quiet passages. Buyer beware if you listen to something that is not loud."
4,definitely better than the belkin tunecast II,"I purchased this from Amazon.com after i got fed up with the quality of the Belkin Tunecast II that I had, which sucked up battery life and had way too much distortion.I like the iRiver because it small and you dont need seperate power as it just fits into your cigarette lighter. The distortion and hiss is much lower than the Belkin, but every once in a while I do hear a little.Cons - Price on the FM transmitters are going down fast, this should be available for 20$. The cigarette lighter adapter is a little oversized for my Acura and I had to force it in."
4,There are better options than this one,"The iRiver transmitter faithfully sends my Ipod music to the stereo on my car. I live in the Dallas and I do not need to change transmitter radio stations while driving around the metroplex. The iRiver transmitter can overpower weaker stations.The clarity of the reception depends on the placement of the Ipod and the placement of the wire connecting the Ipod to the transmitter. It appears that the wire is part of the antennae. Thus, keeping the Ipod on the floor will give static. Placing the Ipod on the dashboard or in the cupholder gives wonderful reception."
2,Burned out in 4 months,"Used this every so often while driving long distances. Was not abusive to this product as it was taken care of. After 4 months the transmitter would work for a minute and then short out. Checked the fuse to make sure that wasnt the problem, which it wasnt. Wouldnt recommend this product to anyone that wishes to have it for a long time."
3,Not the swiftest boat in the fleet...,"...but it will get you there. The need to continuously adjust the frequency to get a static-free signal is annoying at best, maddening at worst. The three pre-sets are fairly useless, unless you're in a zone with great signal strength. Also, not great for music, but perfect for those oddball podcasts you're so fond of."
5,Does what it's supposed to do,"I received this item a few days ago, and it does exactly what I was wanting it to do. I can choose any FM station to tune in to, and the sound quality is excellent. It was VERY EAST to install .... almost didn't need the directions. There aren't many ""gadgets"" on it, which allows ease and simplicity.I have no complaints."
1,"Having the same ""turning off sporadically"" issue","At random intervals (three hours, or twenty seconds) the player turns itself off. This has happened in two different cars, one relatively new and the other relatively old...so I'm fairly convinced it's an issue with the player. I plan on returning it. Not impressive. This is my first radio transmitter so I can't rate the sound quality...seemed okay if you turn the player down and the stereo up. But the ""off now!"" issue is too much."
4,A very convenient gadget,"This item is probably the best thing you can put it your cigarette lighter if you have an MP3 player. No more carrying around and fumbling with CD's in the car. Sound quality and max volume suffer a little with the ""s"" sounds and WOW effects when compared to CD's, but it's definitely worth it if you want to make car audio more convenient."
5,it works great,"I have a belkin FM transmitter, it was terrible and full of static. This one works great."
2,Keep it Cool,"The performance of the iRiver AFT-100 was acceptable, especially since I use it only for audio books. The convenience was worth the ""only fair"" sound quality. However, a few days in a hot car and the Aft-100 was toast!! The outside temp was only about 85 degrees F, but the AFT-100 is dead. Buy it if you want, but be sure to take it out of the car on hot days! (Amazon's price WAS the best I could find.)"
1,does not work,"Don't waste your money. Very poor sound quality, lots of static, driving around is impossible b/c although you might get okay reception for one mile, it's all static for the next three. It also makes a difference where the mp3 player is located in the car. Too close to the iRiver? Static. Too far away? Static. A little to the right? Static. And there's always a low hiss, even if you can keep the static to a dull roar. I used this thing for 15 minutes before removing it and going back to CDs."
1,Don't buy - died 10 days after warranty expired,"My iRiver transmitter was great -- acceptable fidelity, nicely designed small package-- right until it died. The warranty is only 90 days. Mine died on day 100. It was not abused -- it stayed in my car the whole time. I called their support line and was told that I'm out of luck. Needless to say, I will NOT replace it with another iRiver unit."
2,What Happened,"I used this in my car and it worked for about three days, then all of a sudden it wouldn't override any station. It was easy to setup and use but it simply wouldn't do what it was suppose to. Couldn't bring in music with any sort of clarity even on stations that were entirely free."
1,Hardly ever works,This item works sometimes. I always seem to need to be adjusting it. I stopped using it because I feel it is not safe to use while driving.
5,"Works great in Arlington, VA!!","Sometimes have to switch channels but works great here in Arlington, VA which is rapidly becoming a busy, congested metropolitan area with lots of office buildings and lots of traffic to go with it."
1,Piece of Junk,"This product does not work under any circumstance. You may get lucky and one out of a dozen tries it will work for about 45 seconds then fades out. It will not function again until totally diconnected and hooked up again. Then, if your lucky, another 45 seconds. Absolute garbage !"
4,FM transmitter,This is the best FM transmitter I have found for the money. It has very little interference noise compared to some others that I have used in the past.
4,Works well in a crowded radio area.,"Living in a large metropolitan area, I've been looking for a FM transmitter that was 1) easy to use and 2) had more than one preset for easy station changing. For the price, I was very happy when I received this item.Pros:3 station presetsbight LCD screenease of useCons:none as of yet"
5,Aft 100,"I would recommend this product, it works great and when it gets a little static you just choose a different preset channel. It is great that i dont have to worry about batteries, and it has a nice colored face to it."
2,3 months perfect,"I was extremely happy with this for the first 3 months I had it, then it just stopped working. It comes on, but doesn't transmit on any channel. It only has a 90 day warranty so I'm out of luck on returning it. I bought the Belkin Tunecast II and returned it the next day...piece of junk. Now I have one by Monster Cables and it seems good so far."
3,works,better be real close to your outside antenna if you don't wnat static. works in both the taurus and the pickup. Less static in the pick-up
4,Overall an excellent buy,"Works very well. Audio quality is excellent.The manual states that, for better quality adjust the volume on the iPOD. In practice, I am finding that keeping the iPOD volume to be less than 50%, seems to give better reception. Else there is choppiness/static in the audio. The auto-off/on feature is also handy.Finding better luck when using the lower frequencies in FM (87.9-90.1 Mhz), in the DC metro area.Couple of issues1. Occasionally the device does not turn on automatically, even when music is played on the iPOD. Often occurs only when the car is turned on. Not sure if this is an issue with the device/car!!!2. Since there is no way to battery power this device, end up always having to use the cigarette lighter adapter."
1,Don't Bother,"I have found the iRiver to be a complete waste of money. For one thing, it has the worst cigarette lighter plug that I have ever encountered. It wiggles in the socket. The plug doesn't make contact in order to receive voltage, so the thing never turns on. If by some miracle you are ever able to get it to power up, it works great... as long as you don't touch it. At all.I wish I knew why it worked so well for others. I've tried using it in a few of my friends' cars and had the same trouble.Horribly buy, don't bother."
1,iRiver Transmitter stinks,Im very disappointed in this transmitter.My songs never ever come in clear.Its really annoying and i hate it.Dont get it and buy something thats not wireless.
1,Don't bother buying this thing.,"I bought this electronic gadget, and it work flawlessly for about 3 weeks. Then, It just stop working, and I'm stuck with a piece of you know what, instead of music coming trough my radio from my mp3 player.I'll better buy a cable, it works better and for a longer time."
2,Worked fine - for 3 months,"Worked well - sound quality was decent, though not spectacular. Interference if you got too close to a radio station, but that was to be expected. Overall, no real complaints with the device - until it decided, with no particular instigation, to go into its standby mode (as it does when there's no signal coming through). Now, after three months of use, it can't be used for more than about 45 seconds without shutting down. You can unplug it, plug it back in, and it will work, but that gets old very quickly.Decent product, lousy quality."
4,Great Product!,Great product to use with any Mp3 player. Range is good and sound quality is what you would expect from a fm transmitter. I am using it with an iRiver H340 and found that the transmitter does not clip as much if you set the volume on your Mp3 player to about 50%. The unit does turn itself off after 30 seconds if it doesn't have a signal or if the input is low. If you are playing classical music or something really soft this may annoy you.Overall what I have read and heard by word of mouth this is a really great product.
2,Broke after a year of use,"It played fine for about a year, but something broke inside so the side contacts no longer make contact with any power outlet (They are now 'springy', not allowing for a tight fit in the socket). It was okay while it lasted."
4,iRiver AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter,"I chose the iRiver AFT 100 after much web surfing and reading other reviews. This transmitter works very well with my Creative Zen Vision M! The three preset feature is very useful. I tend to stay on one station and get low noise and no dropouts. It is not as good as a direct hardwire connection of course but it does the job. For clarity of sound, the volume of my player needs to be adjusted/balanced with the car radio volume depending on whether I'm listening to music or audiobooks.I only give it 4 stars because it's such a small unit and the controls/buttons are very small and diffucult to press with my large hands."
5,Works great in a Prius too,"In case any 2005/6 Prius owners are wondering: yes, it works just great in the Prius too. I use it with a MuVo 100, which rests in the cupholder. No problems and it glows a cool blue :-)"
5,Book Review,The book is really great. Anxious to do a log cabin pattern. Gives you many options to change the basic look of a log cabin.
1,Not what was expected!,"I was hoping this book was on major manufactured cups and saucers (Royal Albert, Shelley, Royal Copenhagen, etc.)not strange, weird, and ugly! I was very disappointed."
1,Terrible!,"It is ridiculous and I feel betrayed when I recieved this book. It is not expensive, but totally unecessary. I want inspirations for painting, but this one has absolutely nothing! Compare itwith Sheila Southwell and you will know why. I laughed about it, and my friends too!For this reason I'm grateful, and rated this book with 1/5 stars."
5,Beautiful Book,"I read this book as a child. About a year ago I bought it here thinking it might not be as I remembered it. It was! I want to purchase one for my best friends daughter, I think she will love it!"
4,It's a perfect fit . . .,"I purchased this dog bowl for my brother and sister-in-law (well, for their two dogs, really) along with a book of hiking trails around where they live (Las Vegas). They loved the idea of taking their dogs hiking and the convenience of having a water bowl ready in a flash. They love their dogs and can now take them hiking and be ready with the water bowl when the dogs need a break! The water bowl is sturdy and flexible."
4,I got realistic advice for real problems that WORKED,"Dr. Rimm's explicit advice hit on a number of points for our family's individuals. . . amazingly correct assumptions on reactions to common mistakes and how to deal with them. I first brought it home from the library but after renewing it 5 times, I realized I might as well just purchase it for reference! I'd like to thank her in person, for she's saved my second son from his mom's poor reactions to her first son's problems. Thank you!!"
4,A must have for your collection,"Once was lost now is found. I thought the good ol'e days of rock n' roll were dead until I saw these guys jam out at Shuba's in Chicago. This album is cookin' with gas, you gotta grab it while you can."
5,"HUT,HUT,HUT","As you all know, Jerry Spinell has wrote many great book.like Loser,The Library Card, Maniac Magee,and Wringer. But,I think Crash is has his best yet . It's about a boy named John Coogan. But they call him Crash because he is so good in football. But then there is Penn Webb. The geeky vegtable eat neigbhor. He is so geeky he is on the cheerleading team. This is a great book and I strongly recommne you to read this great."
5,for readers looking for a realistic story,If you want a good realistic story. You need to read CRASH by Jerry Spinelli. It is about a young boy who has a new neighbor. Named Penn Web this new kid is kind of a nerd so crash the main charactor has a hard time relating to the new kid so he gives him a hard time they go through school together and in 5th grade a new kid moved into the neighborhood him and crash are instant friends. They play football together and they decide to do track. Then crash gives up the win at the penn relays and at the end they all become friends.by:Hunter S
4,Crash was a really good book,I am 11 years old. I liked this book because it thought me so much about how you should not judge on looks and how i do not want to be to others. This book is about a boy (Crash) who thinks he is all that. He also always has to win. He picks on a boy named Penn who is differnt. Then he meets a friend Mike who is just like Crash. Then after a dramictic event Crash starts looking at things a different way. This book was also very funny and used nicknames that made my whole class laugh. I would tell people to read this book. I think this book is good for kids 10-14 because it relates to that age group. You should read this book if you want to laugh and learn a good lesson at the same time.
4,An Okay Book,"I think crash is a great book for this age group .It teaches us what can happen in public schools. I thougth crash would be a bully the whole time. But, turns out he becomes like Penn. Penn is some one that gets picked on a lot."
4,Franchesco's Crash Review,"The main characters are Mike, Crash, Penn, and Scooter, but Crash is the most important character in the story. He is a very good football player. He thinks he is cool and is popular. He met Penn in first grade. Penn is from North Dakota. He is very dorky. Crash is mean to Penn and when Mike moves in during sixth grade, he joins Crash and they pick on Penn together. They took his buttons away and they put mustard in his shoes. Then Scooter moves in when Crash is in 7th grade. Scooter is his grandfather. Crash is very excited because he is staying for good and they spend a lot of time together. Something happens to Scooter and he ends up in the hospital. This is when Crash begins to change. You will never guess who become friends!I like how Jerry Spinelli wrote because he wrote how we talk. I liked to read the book almost every day. You should read the book because it is interesting and funny!"
1,Mean-spirited,"Yeah, I know, I see reviews here on Amazon and other book review sites that think this book is hilarious, but I just thought it was mean-spirited and not funny at all. Even the big ""change-of-heart"" at the end seemed contrived.Intended for middle-school students who find stuff like that funny, but I don't think it is funny to provide them with more ideas for their bullying."
3,OMG,This is a cool book. in the sory of crash John coogan looses his brain and becomes a robot. after he becomes one he starts onj an epic journey to take over the world
3,An okay book,"Crash is a book about a boy named John Coogan. His nickname is Crash, he earned it. By ""CRASHing"" into his cousin when he was little.His new nieghbor Penn. Is a ""GEEK"" as Crash says.Crash changes to a man who LOVES to play football. To a boy who is caring!"
5,Football fans you will love this book!,"You never know what is going to happen next!Its three different books in one!Its a football book,and a chickflick,and a book about friends all in one!I reccomend it to boys but not really girls.Crash is my favorite book!"
4,good book to read,"It is a nice book, we used it as part of the reading component for our NFL Impact Program here at the Joint Educational Project at USC. The kids liked it very much, and we will be using it in the future. The content was very relevant."
4,Really good... Sort of,"It was pretty good, but not the best...This book is about a boy named Crash Cogan who meets a weird kid from across the street. They don't hit it off. In fact Crash even buries the kids truck! But as the years pass Crash sees the real kid in him... What happens next? Read it and find out...It's moving, but it just didn't didn't have the same flare as the other books he wrote did... It could have been a bit more thought through but it was still good..."
3,Maybe Not the Best For Me But I Liked It Also,"Crash Coogan, Springfield's ""seventh grade football sensation,"" is a bully. the novel does not directly state that beacause Crash Coogan is telling the story from his point of view. Crash mainly bullies on a fellow student who wear's buttons on his shirt's that say ""peace,"" and ""save the planet,"" his name is Penn Webb. Penn is a vegaterian who has no toys, who also is a ""quaker."" Crash and his buddy Mike Deluca make sure his life is pure heck. Crash and Mike simply hate him, even if he is a little strange. But soon Crash questions himself, are the pranks really worth it, are the names really fun? Soon Crash realizes that he, Crash Coogan, seventh grade football sensation, may, just may, be wrong...------------This was an excellent read, I will admit, I was a bit to old for this, so that's why it took away from it, as the text was to me ""childish."" Fourth and Fifth graders would probably think that this book is a marvellous read, as it was for me too."
4,Good Book,"The story of Crash is about a boy named John coogan, who gets the nick name of Crash when he gets his first football helmeton christmas. When he got it he Knocked his cousin so far back into the snow that his cousins family refused to come in.Crash is now in 7th grade and goes to Springfield. He is a football sensation. Crash's best friend Mike Deluca and Crash cant think of anything better to do then to make Penn Webb's life miserable, perpettualy. Penn doesnt even know that Crash and Mike are even doing those horrible pranks and jokes on him. Penn is Ardent about stopping the mall from being built. He isa vegatarian quaker with prehistoric parents but, when Mike takes a joke to far Crash has to decide who side he is really on"
4,CRASH,"John Patrick Coogan is a headstrong seventh grader who is also very athletic. His nickname is Crash because he is always crashing into things and people. Crash is that kind of kid who is a big football star, track star and basically he is a star at everything else that involves sports.Along with his friend Mike Deluca, he loves to pull pranks and jokes on annoying Penn Webb. Crash met Penn Webb when he was six years old, and since then he has always sort of hated him in a way. One day, one of their insidious pranks goes way too far. The result led Crash to believe that Mike Deluca was not a real great friend to hang out with anymore.In conclusion, I think the theme of this novel is to inform people that you do not know who your real friends are until you meet them. I would recommend this book to all seventh graders or young football players or even other atheletes."
4,Crash by Jerry Spinelli,Crash Coogan has hated Penn Webb since he was in the first grade. He gets more and more mad at him until things start to change. He and his best friend Mike Deluca play tricks on him just for fun while Crash maintains a football record for Springfield. Crash has to decide who's side he's on.Mike Deluca....or....Penn Webb?
5,"Excellent story, easy reader!","I was first introduced to this book during a student teaching experience in a middle school. The teacher at that time used this as the first book that all of the students read. Since then, I have read this story aloud to my own middle school students and they absolutely love it! There is something about it that draws readers in and makes you want to read more and more. The characters are relatable and identifiable, there are plenty of parts to make you laugh and almost weep, and there are plenty of lessons to be learned. This is a great story that can be used in the classroom in many ways, and for many purposes."
5,Crash Coogan Crashed into My Favorite Book Collection,I really enjoyed reading this book because I could relate to many of the topics introduced in the book.
4,Not as good as Stargirl,"This was a very interesting book. I liked it alot, butin the end it was kind of confusing. Just like Jerry Spinelli's other books, its very hard to put down."
5,vary good,I think this is the best ever written I could relly relate to the charactors and it was very realistic also I wanted to add that it souded like me and my friend anoymess
4,He Scores Another Touchdown!,"If you love football you'll love this book. Crash, a teenage fullback who can run over anybody for a touchdown. On his way Crash befriends a neighborhood dork named Penn. I liked this book because it was about football and friendship. This book also taught me a lesson to not judge people by the way they look, but to get to know someone before you judge them. You should read this book. It flows and you won't be able to put it down."
4,Crash,Crash is awsome book for sport fanatics.Also girls may read this book for the romance between the 2 people.With un-suspecting twists and turns I highly reccomend this book. If you like humor and pranks this might be a great source for laughs.
4,Crash by:Jerry Spinelli,"This book will knock you out of your seat. John Coogan gets his nickname Crash for tackling one of his relatives!Crash has a sister,she wants to start a zoo in the backyard.Crash has a grandfather named Scooter.He says that she should go ahead with the zoo.Scooter also makes animals into stew, one is octopuss stew. Crash also has a new kid on the block named Penn Webb and hes a cheerleader. Oh yeah theres a girl in Crashes life. You'll have to read on to find out who! By:Ryan"
3,"good book, bad service","The book itself is well written, and I'm learning a lot from it. HOWEVER, the selling-point for me was, as advertised inside the back cover, the companion site with source code and graphics used in the examples in the book. Some competitors' books have a CD-ROM included, but I chose this one figuring accessing a Web site would be just as easy. Well, the Web site does not exist. Bringing this to the publisher's attention was a waste of time. They were neither concerned, apologetic, or interested in making any kind of effort to accept responsibility or rectify the situation. Bad customer service.... I'm quite annoyed."

5,Truly Anointed,"I was a guest at the recent CD Release Concert in Atlanta. There are really no typical words to describe the concert. It was not just an awesome concert, but it was a life-changing experience. God's oil has truly anointed this young man to accomplish great exploits through this CD. Songs like ""Another Place"" and ""Unfailing Love"" will find their way into your spirits and encourage true worship and dependence on our Maker."
5,Title Perfect!,"Just what I needed! Another anointed saint. I love every song on this CD. Thank you Micah for listening, and obeying God's call on your life. Your dedication shows in your developed talent. I'm sold on Jesus for life and I will always be listening. God bless you and your family.Anita"
4,2nd Time Purchased this Charger,"I owned a Sony Cycle Energy Power charger for about 4 years and it was good for charging my Kodak digital camera batteries.Recently the batteries wouldn't hold a charge for more than an hour or so and given that the price of new rechargable batteries was almost the price of this charger with batteries, I decided to buy another Sony charger.Besides the ease of use, another advantage is that it works with both 220 and 120V. Its very easy to forget what the voltage rating is when travelling."
5,Luis Garcia,"Greetings, excellent product purchase without any inconvenience, in good and perfect conditions, the product selected, 100% responsible, I recommend it. Is Ecology."
2,"It's ok, not great","I charge the batteries and as soon as I put them in the camera, the battery light starts flickering. Then it goes off. Then on. THen after a little while I have to change batteries. Clearly thse batteries are not as good as the regular alkaline, but I'll use them. For vacation though, I'll bring a bunch of alkalines too."
5,A great battery/charger combo,I bought this for my canon sx10 and with just a 5hour charge i was able to take close to 400 pictures and 30minutes of movie with it.This is a very good battery and the price is reasonable as well. I would surely recommend this.
2,works fine but take 8 hours to charge,I needed some rechargable battries so I bought them quickly from amazon because these battries had good rating. They work fine as promised but if I knew it takes 8 hours to charge these battries I would not have bought them. The reason I gave this battery two starts is because I think now a days no one should be buying a battery whict takes more than an hour to charge.
2,Nice Price but poor lasting batter y performance.,I bought this item for my digital camera. I was hoping to get away from conventional batteries. But these batteries only last a very short time without being recharged and even then do not last any time at all. I let them frain down all the way and let them recharge fully and still they do not last any length of time in a digital camera. They may last longer in any other thing that takes AA batteries but not as demanding as a camera with zoom and all. I haven't tried them on that. But I do not reccommend them for a digital camera with auto focus and zoom.
1,Don't waste your money,"After a full charge, two of these batteries will only allow between 8 to 10 pictures to be taken before the charge runs out. Using all four fully charged batteries will allow you to take between 15 to 20 shots.I've had to keep standard AA batteries on hand because these Sony Re-chargeable batteries completely lose their charge after just sitting in the charger overnight.Two standard AA batteries will allow about 30 to 40 pictures before they go dead."
5,World Class Feature,Anything that eliminates an AC-DC adapter from my luggage gets my attention. This is a small unit that has 110-220 volts US plug built in. No wall wart to schlep. Hooray!Update: 15-March-2005 Plastic lid broke off. Not a biggy but should have been sturdier. Still pleased with it's usefulness and travelability.
1,Bad Charger!!,"Well, I bought this product taking in account reviews made by customers. A lot of people says it's a good product, but my experience it's completely different. Basically the charger is a timed charger and does not detect batteries been fully charged. I have used this charger for over a year. At the beginning I thought I was doing it wrong. Batteries very hot after ""charging"" and charge does not last any longer than a month. I use the batteries for mouse and keyboard. I have an energizer charger with charge indicator and it's working just fine batteries charged in it last for months and no problem at all. Does not charge batteries as it's supposed to do.I don't recommend this product, it's really bad."
1,Do not work with Canon Cameras,"I bought these after reading the good reviews, when I received them I charged them and put them in my Canon Powershot S5. They seemed to work. A few days later I took my camera out to take photos and when I turned on the camera, it flashed the message ""change the batteries"". Recharged them fully at home. Put them in - ""Change the batteries"".These were defective and are useless to me."
5,Great Buy,I have used the batteries many times and they always charge up and keep a good charge. I recommend this product.
5,Battery charger,This is a simple 4 battery charger that I am using for my digital camera. Works great and lives up to lots of turning the camera on and off!
2,review after 1 year of use,"I bought these batteries and charger about 1 year ago. At first they charged well and I had no problems. used them in cameras and Wii remote and flashlights. but after 1 year of recharging or about 8 recharges, the batteries get very hot after charging and dont last as long. I use both AAA and AA batteries. plus the LED light used to turn from yellow to green after charged but now just shuts off. There must be something wrong because the batteries get so hot, its uncomfortable holding them in your hands. not enough to burn but hot."
5,It charges.,not much to say. it charges just like it's supposed to. We bought and extra 4 batteries and just swap them out. :-)
5,Excellent product,"It's very useful easy to carry , works with both 110 and 220 volts, very practical!"
1,sony charger,"This is a terrible product, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The batteries won't hold a charge, you can charge it all night and the batteries last less than 5 minutes."
1,not working.,"it should have 2500 mAh AA batteries but got only 2100 mAh. I tried to charge it as written in the manual (7hours) but battery hold no charge. I don't no what's wrong.. is it battery or the charger, but no matter. I bought it together and it should work together ."
4,good for 1.5 years,"Bought this about 1.5 years back. Worked well. Now it is not working. The indicator light blinks, but the battery is not charging. See if there is a better one available."
5,Three Years Later,"I bought these batteries three years ago for XBox Game controllers, and they still work well. They don't hold their battery life as long as they used to, but these batteries have saved us ton of money because we are frequent gamers. I'm so pleased with these that I'm buying another two packs."
4,Works as described.,Thanks for the deal. I have no idea what more to write but since I have a word requirement I will write again that it works well.
4,Very Good,"Very good product and very good seller. I really happy with my buy. I just had a similar power charger. I recommend this product and obviously, this seller.Thanks from Argentina"
5,Excellent,"Well, I bought this charger for its shear brand name add to that four free batteries. The items are performing as specified and also order reached ahead of time. I am satisfied. Hope you you too will."
2,"After 10 recharges, batteries don't hold much juice.","I have used this product for over a year, and after about 10 times charging them in the charger, batteries will not last more than 2 weeks even if they are not user at all, if I charge them and use them for a week and take about 20-30 pictures, batteries are then dead."
2,Useless after less than a year,"I bought these batteries in Nov. 2006 for use with a Canon Power Shot A530.For the past several months, maybe going back to August or September 2007, I've barely used my camera because the batteries can't hold a charge. At first, even sooner than that time, it was just that you charged all 4 and then the 2 that didn't go in the camera drained quickly. It was pointless having 2 pairs because you would go to put your backup pair in the camera and they were dead.Now even after they are fully charged, the battery icon shows up on the camera as soon as you put the batteries in. You can take a small handful of pictures but that's about it."
2,"Charger is fine, but the batteries are already kapoot!","The charger itself is just fine, but I gave my son and his wife this set for his Canon digital camera at Christmas 2006. The batteries are already kapoot and won't take a charge. It's only been 9 months. Not a very good track record. I have recharable batteries for my digital camera that have been going strong for more than three years now. They are a different brand that came with my Sony DSC73 camera. Go figure..."
4,Good for the price,"Pros: Cheap, durableCons: Taking almost 7 hours to chargeIf charging time is not a problem for you, this is an excellent product to buy."
3,Not the best but not the wrost either!,"Battery life is not satisfactory and it takes charger a long time to actually charge the batteries. I do not know either the charger or the batteries should be blamed for. Probably this product is not the best but may be good enough, may be!"
4,Woks fine for me!!,Bought these to use with Geocaching. Now keepin my Oregon 450 and flashlights working. Like feature of being able to charge 1-2-or all 4 of the batteries at any time. True test of this review will be how long the life of these batteries will last. So far just fine.
3,Charging time,"I bought this without knowing what the charging time was. I took a risk since it was at an affordable price and found out to my dismay that the charging time is as follows:1-4 batteries:2100mAh Approx 7 hours1700mAh Approx 6 hours800mAh Approx 7 hours700mAh Approx 6 hoursI haven't used the product yet...I just got it today. I don't know. I might return it for the Kodak 1 hour charger one for the same price (18.99) but the deal is gone for this product, it's back to 19.99. Anyways...pretty fast shipping though =)"
3,"Good batteries, for about 2 years","I have had these for 2 years. i dont think anyone comes back to write a review for a purchase made after 2 years.I have never had any problems with these batteries in the first 2 years. I have a canon 4MP camera with a 1GB card and i have run out of memory but never the charge on the batteries.Now after 2 years of moderate use, the batteries wont charge. They might be losing charge after 2-3 days of charge if they lay around idle.I have used other rechargeable and they are expected to last longer."
4,Great batteries with a decent charger,Batteries have a great run time. Charger is satisfactory.I am satisfied with this product
2,Power Charger,"The power charger seems to work fine, but the batteries dont hold much of a charge. Definitely not what I was hoping for, hence why I give it 2 stars. At least the charger seems to work."
5,Excellent Product,Very happy with the order. Delivery time was better than I expected. Will buy again...
1,ACCA KAPPA HAND WASH,"I love the product, but it was broken when it arrived. The top was broken and I had to pour it into another bottle just to use it."
1,Palm trees,I was sadly disappointed by my purchase. Made cheap and not durable. I am returning the palm trees. Beware when you buy something from Shindigz you are responsible for return cost.I had no rating for this product but to write review I had to pick one...mine would be less than 1 star.This company knows that most people will not return items they bought from them because it is so expensive to return.Their shipping cost is a fourth of what it will cost you to return item(s).I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!!!
4,Great DVD!,"I'm so glad I got this DVD for my wife. It has helped here in so many ways. I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about, but it definitely has been good for her. I'd highly recommend it to anyone on bedrest or not. I've bought quite a few DVDs from this company and have been satisfied with everyone. They have really good instructional dvds. Thanks!"
1,"""Simple"" Yoga is an understatement","This DVD is very slow paced and I am by no means an exercise enthusiast, but this was a little too simple for me. Perhaps if you are brand new to yoga or have never exercised, the simplicity of this yoga workout might be advantageous (any workout is better than no workout, right?), but otherwise it gets boring fast. I'd opt for a different workout that can be modified for beginners but also provides more levels as your fitness level increases."
1,in a word...,"Having purchased and used yoga videos in the past, I would simply describe this CD as horrible! The yoga practice is very brief and disjointed. Most of the time on the CD is head shots of the two English ladies who host the CD and talk too much! Less than impressed! If I hadn't opened it, it would be returned!"
3,Its ok..,"It works all right, but the magnet makes the door a bit stiff if cats are a little nervous they will not use.The locking mechanism is oddly placed in the cats path making accidental locking possible."
4,Glad I bought it,"I wanted to allow our cat access to her litterbox in the basement, but keep the door closed for humidity control. I received this item this week and installed it today in about a half hour. The included instructions were in five languages, but no English, but it wasn't hard to figure out what to do. I just wish the instructions had included guidelines for how high to install the door; I was afraid I had it too high, but now that the cat is going through it, I see that she has to crouch down quite a bit. In any case, the fit and finish was good and the construction quality seems more than adequate for indoor use. It's nice to have an easy home improvement project for a change!"
5,Great cat door,This door is weather tight and the instructions were easy to follow. My cat had never used a door before and he learned quickly. We installed ours on the side door to our garage and it worked out perfectly!
3,DOES NOT FULLY LOCK!!,"It will either be open both ways, or let the animals in but not out. There is no way to not let them neither in or out. Stupid!! Otherwise, it is a good, solid product. We placed it on an outside wall, nicely sealed with silicone. If you are considering it, get the same brand but get the one with the two locks (green and red). This one only has the red one. If you are putting it on a wall, get two of the wall liners!"
4,R. Lane Herron's Guide to Dolls - still useful!,"R. Lane Herron's price guide was one of my first ""bibles"" of doll identification. Clearly, the Blue Book series, originally by Jan Foulke, is the place to go for current market values, but Mr. Herron's guide is charming, enthusiastic and informative. His categories are not the standard ones in the field now... he includes paperdolls, for example... and it's not difficult to figure out where his own tastes in doll collecting lie. But, even after all these years, there are some dolls for which I have to go back to Herron's guide. There's also no arguing with his taste in dolls, which is refined and informed. It may not turn out to be the most-used volume in your doll reference library, but it's a valuable source with many black-and-white photos and covers some dolls that have been left out of more recent guides."
1,They can't call this a product!,"I purchased one of these products and have had nothing but trouble with it. It is poorly contructed and has an extremely short standby battery life. (i.e. less than 3 days). I had the unit replaced and I was able to get 4 days of standby time out of it. It appears that thier QA/QC function at Digital Research is non-existent. It almost appears like they made an engineering change in the middle of a production run. The hardware is not worthy of being considered as a doorstop. The software is buggy and has problems, especially with the newer operating systems (WinME, Win2K, and WinXP) It locked up my system and I had to remove it so my system would become stable again!"
4,the big heat stan ridgway,"This is a good record for any wov fan, or not. Stans stuff is always interesting with out doubt, and there are certainly musical gems here. I think it took 3 listens before I found them. It's so dead-pan that it can take awhile to shine at potential"
4,"Fun, creatively original, ideas","Some of the song ideas on this CD have been better done in Stan's other work, but none of them are boring. I never get tired of listening to this music collection- especially the rockabilly remake 'Foggy River'."
4,MIssed it for 20 years,"It's different and it's dated, but it's also timeless. I could do without the extra tracks that weren't of the original, but i guess that is what the skip function is for."
4,RIdgeway or Wall of Voodoo,"If you like Wall you'll love this album. The songs are fun, catchy, and unique."
5,A Patsy Cline Fan Must Read,"I am the secretary for the Always Patsy Cline Fan Organization and I have to say, I'm pretty picky about my Patsy Cline merchandise, info., etc.This book was so interesting to me because you really found out who Patsy was. She struggled just like the rest of us. It blew me away at how tight things were for her. Although times were tough, she kept going to make her dreams come true.You could really tell how much she loved Charlie and her new daughter, Julie. Randy wasn't born yet.It was really easy to read and I couldn't put it down. It's a real treasure to have something like this about someone we don't know much about, because of how short of a time she was with us.If you are in any way a fan of Patsy Cline, this is a must read for you. It also contains a few new photos.Enjoy!"
4,belkin speaker cable,"actual color isn't white, which was the color i needed. but other than that it works great. sound is so much better than what i had before."
2,Looks nice but the quality is not that great!!!,I bought some wires at home depot and they did not look that great so I found some white ones that blended in well to my wall. They did not perform quality wise and I had rewire again so not worth it.
2,Wanted wire for esthetics but was not as discribed!!,"I'm sure there's nothing wrong with this wiring, but it was not what I expected when I ordered it. It is not white (I would say more creamy/grey) which is really what I wanted in order allow for discrete running.The wire is also fairly chunky also not helping it be discrete."
5,Perfect Hummel for Grandma,We purchased this Hummel for my mother-in-law to replace the one she had for years that had broken. She was thrilled to receive it for Christmas. It arrived in perfect condition and did not take long to receive it. We would highly recommend this source. They are beautiful pieces of art.
3,Step backward for Plano,"The box looks fine from the outside, but light weight plastic and very cheap hinges make me wary of the durability of the box. Went to open it and almost pulled one of the hinges out of their slot, very wobbley opening. buyer beware."
5,Very Nice!,"I ordered this for my mother who is an amateur fisherman in the Florida panhandle, and she absolutely adored this box!"
3,Would like to contact seller,"I purchased this item for my son in law...He was very excited and started putting fishing stickers on it immediately.However, when we went to completely open the box - extending the expandable drawers - the box bent...Upon evaluation of the tackle box, the pin that connects the opening/closing hinge in the back was not there...Because he really liked the box, we worked to troubleshoot and purchase replacement hinge.I was very embarrassed to give a broken item as a gift."
3,Easy to use and Lightweight,Great for short to medium length hair. Not quite hot enough for my thick hair. Better for people with thinner hair.
3,might not be what you think it is....,"I suppose it was worth it for the sheer comic value, and the lesson to not buy anything without a description. I thought I was ordering an audio cd _reading_ of LOTR, but what I received was a collection of eraserhead-esque hissing darkwave (3 cd's worth) and an erotic map of middle earth rendered by some Luis Royo clone.Pure gold telling friends I have an 'erotic Map of middle earth' however."
1,An Erotic Poster of Middle Earth??,"I bought this item thinking I was buying the audio version of the LOTR. Much to my suprise, the CD box set and enclosed poster are both decorated with mostly nude women in erotic poses. Boy was my 10-year old son suprised!! Regardless, we gave the music a try, and in the words of my son, ""It stunk!!""."
2,High School Music Engineering Project?,"I find it difficult to believe that some bored kids didn't make this ""dark symphony"" on a weekend. If you like minimalist ""burps"" of sound from saxes, oboes, bassoons, etc., with some unimaginative ""chords,"" then buy this disc. I found nothing that relates to Tolkien's works other than the names of the pieces and the enclosed map (with Royo-girls!). On the other hand, the Royo-esque erotic pictures are anything but high school.All in all, I'm disappointed but appreciative of someone who spends an hour recording some music."
5,forbidden,"I couldnt find this movie anywhere and was thrilled to find it here! based on a true story, this is one of the very best films ever made about WWII. it's the less known drama - not the concentration camps, ghettos, partisans or heroic frontiers. just two ""Berliners"", caught in the middle of a storm, and doing what we would wish anyone to do, against all odds. watch it if you can find it."
3,Cherry picking the good stuff,"I was curious to find out why this book was such a poorlyreceived book when it was first released. Joan Benoit's book Running Tide is a somewhat surprising disappointment considering her recent experiences at that time. Although it does lead to many revealing personal attributes, those attributes are not always appealing. The prose is very amatuerish and repetishish.There are however, many interesting tidbits and insightsinto her training and injuries leading up to the 1984 OlympicWomen's Marathon victory.This book is a speed read with minor slow downs to pickout the ""cherries"" in between the blather. Lots of good photosand the copy I received was signed by Joan who remains one of myidols for her Olympic victory."
4,SWEET SOUL MUSIC,"SWEET & SOULFUL 60S-VARIOUS ARTISTS: Here's a worthy example of what the people at K-Tel do best...package a dozen or more various artists' radio singles from a particular era, the company virtually invented the concept of ""mix tapes"". Unlike their slap-dash 70s vinyl hey-day, this pristine CD contains the full length versions, with no ""near-hits"" mixed in to spoil the fun or the flow of the music. SWEET & SOULFUL 60s is just what the title spells out...Mel and Tim's succulent STAX slice BACKFIELD IN MOTION, the Capitols' dance crazed COOL JERK, the Philly cool of the Delfonics' LA-LA MEANS I LOVE YOU, and white funkers the Soul Survivors' EXPRESSWAY TO YOUR HEART are all undisputed truths of the genre. Mix in the marvelous mellow moods of Barbara Lewis' BABY I'M YOURS and the Jerry Butler/Betty Everett duet LET IT BE ME, and you've got a sublime souvenir of a time when what came out over your AM airwaves truly meant something.RATING: FOUR SOULS"
5,Awesome Score,"I just saw this movie yesterday, and man, was it good. Go see it if you haven't yet. It is really a must see. Especially if you love action/suspense/thrillers. Anyway, James Horner did a perfect job scoring this movie. All the music perfectly matched in the scenes that it played in whether it be sad, action, etc. There is a wonderful sad piano theme in here. It is really breathtaking. All in all, defintley recommend."
1,attack of the drones,"Wow, people can cite passages on the soundtrack heard before in films 20 years ago, as evidence of Horner 'recycling'.I cant do that. I just know that he and a handful of others write the most hackneyed scores around, making all films converge towards the mean, become homogenized.How about something original here, like the music adding to the film by providing counterpoint, displaying complexity of emotion?There are many examples of this, but usually not by composition but by incorporating world music or songs known already from pop music. The fact is, Hollywood composers are a cabal, and ingenuity is not valued.The movie was so so, I was given this soundtrack as a radio station promo....another culprit is Danny Elfman, uniformly quirky, but thats another story..."
4,Pretty good book and fast reading for me!,"I liked the book and like another reviewer, when I was a kid, I wished real ""little"" people lived in my doll house. The ending was a surprise to me. I enjoyed the book."
1,"This was a Terrible Book, thats the Nicestway to pukt it!","I found htis book disgusting and it literally made me physically ill with all of the sexual remrks, this book is built on sex and nthing else and i found the parts with Leyna Shaw particulary disturbing, also the fact that roger was a sexually starved pathetic hman, after he had intercourse for the first time he was only excited about the fact that he had found another way to stimulate himself! I found this gross and completely inapropriate the only way to make this book better would be to burn it!"
1,Horrible,"I was so hyped up for this, and man what a letdown. Tremonti is excellent, but the songs themselves are very shallow, and have no good hooks. They lyrics are 3rd rate, and the songwriting is just very stale. I'm selling my copy."
2,Give Me A Break,"Other than ""Open Your Eyes"" and some decent guitar solos by Tremonti, this album blows! Myles Kennedy sounds like a hybrid of Shania Twain and Bobcat Goldthwait on the majority of the songs. The lyrics are uninspiring. In fact, one could probably take the lyrics from one song, put them in another song on the album, and it would sound about the same.I had high hopes for the guys from Alter Bridge, but this album is not good. It is boring. Wasn't it Jimmy Page who once said that in order for a song to be a hit, people needed to be able to hum it? There are no songs on this album that people will be able to hum! The only thing that saves this album from a one-star review is some of the guitar work, otherwise this album is DOA. Buy at your own risk and beware the Alter Bridge Groupie Brigade recommending the thing with five stars!"
1,No Scott?????,Definitely different vocal range. No more Creed..what a disappointment. Scott Stapp's voice can draw you in and keep you there. This was okay to listen to but I much prefer Creed. Thank God I listened to it elsewhere before wasting my money!!!!!
1,The epitome of knock off rock n' roll,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, unless you listen to Creed and this pathetic excuse of a band. Please save yourself if you've been infected with the bad music virus. Report to www.youhavebadtasteinmusic.com to learn more about this debilitating disorder."
3,"Good, but not great...","There's one large difference between Creed and Alter Bridge. And it's not just the fact that Scott Stapp has now gotten a higher voice, lost his alcoholic habits and become someone by the name of Myles Kennedy. I'm talking about the overall vibe that I get when I listen to the music.When you listen to Creed's music, it was darker, gloomier and overall had more of a crunch to it. Alter Bridge's lyrics are a lot more uplifting and with their new singer belting it out, it really kind of lost that 'dark edge' I enjoyed with Creed. If I had to put it into clearer wording, the music just sounds more 'shallow' than Creed's work.So, is it bad? No. Actually, it's pretty good. The guitar licks and solos are amazing as expected. Maybe it's just too light-hearted to suit my tastes perfectly. But overall, it's not a decent outing. Hopefully they remain together for a long time, they're a good group who will grow even greater as they mature even further."
4,"one great song, the rest is good","I bought this for one song, bought it used for a buck or so, it was certainly worth the price."
4,Better than the original,"This cd sounds like a Creed and Audioslave cross. Actually, it's better than Creed and could give Audioslave a run for it's money. If you like rock, give it a try. You won't be disappointed."
4,Great!,"This is a great album. I liked Creed and I like the new Alter Bridge. They are different, of course, that is what they were going for..no doubt!I look forward to the next album!"
4,"Next single should be ""In Loving Memory"" GREAT CD","More like 4.5 stars. I am a huge music fan of pop, rock, r&b, club/dance, classic rock, easy listening, etc so my opinion is taken from an unbiased perspective. This is a great CD. Mark T. kicks a _ _ on guitars & he is so hot. My favorite song on this cd is ""In Loving Memory"". Not only because it is such an emotional and powerful song both emotionally & lyrically, but if you haven't noticed that whenever a rock band releases a rock ballad from a cd (like ""The Reason"" from Hoobastank & that one from Creed that was written by Scott S. when he learned he was going to be a father - can't think of the name) the song always tops the charts. It's nice when rockers can showcase their compassionate side. The song gives me chills. This would be a huge hit. The lead singer has a great voice. This is a definite recommendation for music fans."
5,One Day Remains,"This debut album lead by former Creed guitarist Mark Tremonti and singer Myles Kennedy is actually quite refreshing. There are hints of Creed throughout, but this is for the most part a new sound. Kennedy's vocals implement the aggresive nature of such songs as, ""Find the Real,"" and ""Down to My Last."" Say what you will about them being mainstream, they still write and perform great music. I actually regard this as one of the best hard rock albums in the last 15 years. Give it a listen, see for yourself. I have high hopes that Alter Bridge will eclipse even Creed's legacy. Their new CD, Blackbird, is due out October 9th, 2007 and the new single, ""Rise Today,"" further solidifies the fact that they are back for another rocking album. Alter Bridge is for real."
4,Creed who?,"After years of success and accumulating a ton of fans (including myself!), Creed disbanded. While most fans wanted to hear at least something from the former group members, who would have guessed what would follow would be BETTER than Creed? You get that with Alter Bridge's ""One Day Remains"". The album has twice the emotion, complexity, vocal range, guitar riffage...etc! Any fan of rock, Creed, or just good music should grab this disc. You'll jam to ""Find the Real"", sing along with ""Open Your Eyes"", headbang to ""Metalingus"", choke up during ""In Loving Memory"", and totally love ""Shed my Skin""-the album's best track. Pop it in the player, and listen as it gets better and better with each track. What else can I say? Former Creed members Philips, Marshall, and Tremonti are back and better than before!"
3,Even Better,"If anyone wants to hear Myles Kennedy at his finest, check out Mayfield Four -""Fallout"". That cd is amazing, and his voice on the song Suckerpunch is awesome! He has a range that I haven't heard since Freddy Mercury of Queen. I'm glad he's playing with people that will get him the recognition he deserves."
3,not bad not great,"Ok honestly, Alter Bridge is really great and everything, but I still love Creed more. I'm glad at least some people from Creed are together again, but I don't really connect with these songs like I did with Creed. I was hoping for it to be more like the original band and was disappointed to hear they weren't. Scott Stapp was the best part of the band in my opinion and without him it just doesn't work as well for me."
4,An Awesome Rock CD,"***4.5 Stars***For those of you who like real rock and roll, this the cd for you. Formed from the remains of Creed with new lead singer Myles Kennedy, Alter bridge brings a unique mix of hard and powerful rock with some great mellow tracks that are very reminiscent of bands such as Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, STP, Creed, and Audioslave. I consider myslef a fan of ""real"" rock and roll and I was pleasantly surprised after listening to this record. The entire record is listenable, But there are about 5 stand out tracks that are just flat out awesome. I haven't been this impressed with a new rock band since Audioslave last year. If you consider yourself a fan of rock and roll of any kind, don't miss the chance to pick up this record and give it a try. Trust me, you won't be dissappointed."
4,Above average CD,"When this album first come out I was expecting tohear LOTS of Creed. I'm glad to say that isn't thecase... Sure you can hear bits and pieces of Creedevery now and then, but overall this album showcasesMark Tremonti really well and shows his potentialwithout Scott Stapp.The best songs IMO are: Watch Your Words, Metalingus,Open Your Eyes and Find The Real. One Day Remains isalso a pretty good song, but it's a notch below theones I listed above. There are 2 fillers or so heresuch as: In Loving Memory and Shed My Skin. My favoriteis Watch Your Words because Mark kicks @ss in theopening. I think he will be a Rock n Roll Hall ofFamer one day."
2,Heard it all before,"This is not the same old Creed but it's close enough to pass for a cover band. The new singer is not an improvement over Scott Stapp whose vocals while not the best were at least appropriate to the music and stood out in the same way Draiman of Disturbed does or Aaron Lewis of Staind, as well as others. This is a generic rock album laded with weak hooks and an ordinary lead singer sound we've all heard before. It's not a bad album but it's nothing special either and this is not an album that will get much if any, airplay."
2,Buyer beware of mindless reviews,"First off i will not compare this album to anything by creed. next, this album is boring. the lyrics suck and couldve been written by a 13 year old. every song has the same feel to it and gets very repetious. every once and awhile the guitarist will do some cool stuff but other than that he never changes the tone or effects of his guitar. the lead singer sounds odd like he doesnt fit in with the songs - it almost sound kareokee like. i give this album 2 stars and not 1 b/c i save 1's for garbage - for which this is boarderline. this album makes good music for people who dont know music very well."
4,"JUST STARTING, I HOPE","Let's hope that the rumors of the possible re-union remains just a rumor. I like the line up just fine. Sure MT likes so show boat a little on the lead, but Watch Your Words justifies that. This is a power rock band that plays power rock and power ballads without missing a beat. I'm looking forward to the next Alter Bridge cd. Not the Creed re-union cd."
3,Tremonti is good but...,"Mark Tremonti finally did it. He got to right every song, play tons of solo's and be referred to on a first name basis in the albums liner notes cause he is so important. He even named the band! All that aside he is a great, great guitar player but even he can't solo over this bland record. At least he got to totally run the show, he deserves that much after putting up with Scotty Stapp all those years. I think this record would be outstanding if Tremonti just went ahead and sang also. 3 stars for a great guitar rock cd, but I just can't give it 5."
2,I don't like this cd,"This cd is the perfect example that you can have a good guitar player , a good bassist , a good drummer , a good singer and still make songs that have no depth. This cd is very well played but is also very very boring , so before thinking about buying it listen to the song samples first. These guys can rock but I just dont like the songs they play, I don't feel them and I think they lack creativity except for the guitar solos and riffs which are really good but that doesn't change the fact that listening to this cd is like listening to some background music. It's like ambient rock music. Check out 'seven wiser' instead , it's less sophisticated but better in my opinion."
2,Why did they settle for this guy!,"I have listened to this cd front 1 to 11 about 4 times. I can honestly say that there are two songs that our tolerable. I cannot believe they settled for this guy. I can honestly say after listening to this album the 4th time that I had to rip it out of my cd player and gave it to my wife without a burning a copy. His voice is annoying and the tone is awful. I was a huge Creed fan, although, Scott's head got as big as a blimp there is no doubting his talent. I like the lyrics, music and this would have been an amazing album with Scott or someone who had a mans voice, instead of the constant squill of a karaoke singer. MT wrote some great songs, great riffs, but wasted his time auditioning and picking this guy. I predict he won't be on the next album!"
3,first 3 songs are good,"When I heard ""Open your Eyes"" I was Blown away by how good it was. I couldnt wait for the day it would come out. I went to the store the first day it was released and when i got home to listen to it I was very happy with the first 3 songs. But then it got alittle to slow for my taste. The singers oohs and aahs start to get annoying after a while. Dont get me wrong there are a couple of really good songs but it was a bigg disapointment only 2 others songs sound like ""Open your Eyes"" the rest are very slow."
4,Much Better then Creed,"I purchased this album because I sort of like Creed and I was pleasntly shocked. It is a much better then any of Creed's albums their style is a lot different then Creed's. It's a little bit harder. Songs like ""Metalingus"", ""Broken Wings"", are my favorite. Overall a good effort but not amazing."
5,How will they ever follow up with this one?,"Well, Listened to their CD, went to their concert, and they are just amazing! I have never heard a cd with as much potential. These musicians have heart. They have passion. They are better than the 30 million CD-selling Creed, not to take anything away from them. Alter Bridge is the future of rock. Tremonti, hands down is the best guitarist around, Flip, has came into his own with the drums, Marshall, backs Tremonti very well. Kennedy, well-should have been known for a lot longer. Very good melodic singer, and a great guy. I reccomend the whole cd from Tremonti's attack of the guitar on, ""Find the Real"", to the potentially best single of the year, ""Open Your Eyes"". ""Shed My Skin"", is awesome, supported by Kennedy's vocals. ""In Loving Memory"" is beautiful, and well put together. They are the future of rock."
5,"Solid band, great sound","First off, let me say that I am a big fan of Mark Tremonti's guitar style. I was a fan of is work in Creed. That being said, I never paid much attention to Alter Bridge, until I heard Myles Kennedy on Slash's solo album. The guy can freakin sing! I recently saw him in concert and was sold. So, I decided to pick this album up. It is excellent, start to finish. Very diverse. People say that this is a better version of Creed (Myles is the only non-Creed member), but I say they are wrong. The guys really took their music in a different direction, and amazingly, sound nothing like Creed. You take one of the best rock singers out there currently, pair him with a guy who really knows how to play a guitar, and a rhythm section that pounds it out, and you have a great album."
3,Thank God Its Not Creed,Lets face it everyone Creed was some of the lamest formulaic pop-rock anyone has ever heard. Alter Bridge has thankfully not just written a bunch of Creed songs with different vocals. Bear in mind there are obvious similarities which can be expected from a somewhat one dimensional songwriter like Mark Tremonti but there are enough moves in the right direction that this cd is a good buy. If you're a Creed fan you're obviously gonna buy this if you hated Creed like I always have give this cd a shot its not what you'd expect. Pleasantly surprising is the best way to describe this album.
5,Creed who?,"Sure, we all love creed and we,re all sad they broke up BOO HOO, but after you listen to a few tracks on alter bridge's new album you'll say ""wow, Creed never sounded THAT good!"" I feel that creed was all about limitations like ""don't play your guitar too good or keep the drum beat very simple."" With alter bridge it's more like ""mark, you gotta do some serious shredding and Miles, man hit them HIGH notes"". This album is essentialy just 4 guys that go all out with their voice and instruments and their songs reflect that in a very good way. This is one of the FEW cds that i can put in and listen to it all the way through with out ever hitting the skip button. i guess the only reason that you mite have for not liking this cd is that you have a disease that renders you unable to listen to good music."
4,Very solid debut album,"This band takes the best of what was Creed, the music and melodies, and adds an amazing vocalist in Myles Kennedy. The CD is strong from beginning to end with good mix of powerful head-bangers (Metalingus, Watch Your Words, Find The Real), several big ballads (Broken Wings, In Loving Memory), and plenty of straight-up rock (One Day Remains, Down to My Last, and of course Open Your Eyes, the first single). The guitar solo is also making a comeback in this cd with Mr. Tremonti shredding on FTR, OYE, Burn It Down, and Down To My Last. There is still room for improvement in the song writing since a lot a the songs start sounding the same. However, I recommend this cd to anyone who likes loud guitars, soaring vocals, and lovely melodies."
3,"nicely written, but no classic album","Alter Bridge is what I consider to be a very ordinary rock band. However, seeing as how rock music these days isn't exactly the same compared to the 70's, I will cut it some slack. Some of the vocal melodies are actually really good, such as the one on ""Open Your Eyes"". Other times, such as on ""Down to my Last"", the vocals *try* to be memorable, but in the end, a failed attempt at a vocal melody.No, these guys aren't the band to bring back the spirit and the creativity of the 70's rock scene, but give them credit for at least having the talent to write a few decent vocal melodies and for having the energy that's usually associated with these kind of loud, power pop ""rock"" bands. A Creed wannabe band? Perhaps, but I guess there's worse things out there. Commercial rock in every way."
5,Awesome first Effort,"You will forget all about Creed when you listen to this CD. I played it for a friend of mine who loved Creed but knew nothing about Alter Bridge and he never put the two together until I told him who the band members were. It is a great album and this band has a really good sound. Vocals are top notch and the guitars are some of the best you will find anywhere ! I am a huge music fan of hard rock and heavy metal and I think this is one of the best CD's to come out in a very long time. There is no doubt if you buy it, you will not be disappointed."
4,"Great album, retro sound","This album sounds like an updated version of 80's metal ala Skid Row and Motley Crue. If you dig those kinds of bands like I do, you'll really like this album. The track that got me to buy it is called Miseducation and it was after I heard Sebastian Bach interviewed on a national radio show one night. It was well worth the $13 bucks or so."
2,Reminds me of the Movie Rock Star,Tremonti is awesome but Scott Stapp was need (well when his ego goes away.) New singer really does suck!! Creed had flow and you can tell it is missing in this CD. Mabye in the future we'll see good music from Stapp and Tremonti seperatly but it crap wasn't it!
1,Attack of the blonde swingers!,"That is what I think of this album. I'm sick of these ""mega-bands"" forming up, switching band members and such. I loved Creed before this tragedy. Creed may sound the same if you take away this blonde swinger's voice, but that's only because the only thing missing is Scott Stapp's voice. Screw this album up the ass."
1,One star for proving a point,"After all the bitching among fans about how much Tremonti was being held back by Creed, I'm glad he went out and made his own record. It proves that being held back is sometimes a good thing. Tremonti, dude, we know you can play... but the song must come first, and on this album it never does. Shame when ego takes over like that."
1,Such disappointment...,"I loved Creed's first album with original members Mark Tremonti on guitar, Scott Stapp on Vocals, Brian Marshall on bass, and Scott Phillips on drums. However, after that album, I think Scott Stapp was given too much control over the direction of the music and it started to really suck with their second album, and their third was even worse. Then I hear they're getting Brian Marshall back and ditching Stapp, so I get all excited. I'm hoping that I'll get to hear Brian's grungy bass and Mark's powerful guitar riffs once again like in the days of 'My Own Prison' with such kick ass songs as Ode, Illusion, and Unforgiven. This Miles guy comes in trying to sound just like Scott, but worse. So needless to say, I think it sucks."
5,Great Debut for Myles Kennedy with Creed's Original Band,"This album rocks. Thats right...it rocks. Myles Kennedy is the next great vocalists in Creed's original band. Although I'm waiting for what tricks Scott Stapp (Creed's Original Singer) has up his sleve, his band I think did incredible with the new lead singer. The electric guitarist, Mark Tremonti, shows us a little bit heavier side to his music that I know hes been dying to dish out. The Bass player, Brian Marshall, is also back to turn up the heat while the drummer, Scott Phillips, knocks down the rest of the beat. Myles just jumps in to deliver us a softer toned but yet new-aged voice that Scott Stapp could never give us. Although I do enjoy Creed's music I think Alter Bridge will soon become a very successful rock band because of already successful and professional players. I think they will deliver us great and astonishing music in the future. Thanks Alter Bridge...."
5,"Powerful, new band","A friend told me about these guys so i went out and got the cd. I listened to the first couple songs and didnt pick it up again for a while. I lost one of my best friends a couple weeks ago in a car accident and at his funeral they played ""In loving memory of"". At the time i didnt know it was alter bridge until the next day i happened to pop the cd in the truck and listen to it on the way to school, it come to that song and i recognized it right away. Tears ran down my face and that song will be one i wont soon forget. The whole album is amazing, go out and buy it, you wont regret it."
5,Awesome album.,"Alter bridge's first and best album.The songs find the real, one day remains, open your eyes, burn it down, broken wings, mentaligus,and watch your words are awesome songs!"
4,Creed grows up,"Good heavy rock sound just as the old Creed albumns had. The differences in my opinion are added sophistication in the volcals and the guitar playing. This guy can sing... great power, great range, though a bit comercial sounding (think young Sammy Hagar but better range). The guitar playing, while always good is better with lots of power and plenty of impressive leads. If you were into Creed, you'd be into this."
1,This music is insulting!!!!,"One horrible band has split to make two horrible bands. They're like Gremlins, please keep them away from water!!! It sounds like a horrible tribute band of every 90's has been. It could be a bunch of Guitar Center rejects playing half ass Soundgarden covers. Just terribly insulting that this type of music is produced and pushed on music listeners. Anybody who appreciates real thought provoking music should avoid this CD at all costs. This could be almost as bad as Creed, I haven't got the stomach to listen to Scott's solo album, so I can't bring him into this. These guys would do well on American Idol, because it fits that mindless, cheesy, empty droning that you hear from that show."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this CD. Creed was a solid band with lots of great hits. There is not one hit single on this album. I wasted $13 on it. They need to get Scott Stapp back.
1,Proves one thing.........,".....that Scott Stapp wasn't the only thing that stunk about Creed!!! That guitar sound? Horrid. Those arrangements......are these guys over 15 yet? Grow up!! Those guitar solos.......horrid. No TASTE, not an ounce of subtlety ....this guy is a terrible guitar player!!!! That oh so played out mid tempo ""heavy"" drumming....my god, how boring a human being do you have to be to enjoy this kind of music??The new vocalist is slightly less of a mimic, but he's still doing a 90's grunge ""thing"" that has been tired for a LONG LONG TIME!!"
1,Frightening,"Alterbridge, Creed and creed soundalikes are no good. These are horrible songs by horrible bands - cheesy, watered-down, ""safe"" rock. Please save your money and buy something else."
2,Mistake,I bought this book and never use it. The suggestions just don't seem to be a fit with what I do in class. About the only thing I've ever done with it was find a few writing topics to use in my Rhetoric class.
3,Interesting Activities,"We're always trying to get our students to think more critical about their world. This book is fun and entertaining and provides teachers with some good ways to engage students. It doesn't go into much depth, however, and this might be seen as a flaw. But the emphasis of the book is to serve as a touchstone to jump into weighter matters."
2,Don't use as a play mat!!!,"IT advertises on the package that you can use as a mat- but don't! The animals are on strings and if they are not taken off it is a choking hazard. I returned mine- and the people at Target told me ""It says choking hazard right on the box."" Why buy something for your baby to protect them- that could do alot more harm?"
5,"Love, Love, Love it!","This is great! My son has so much fun with this cart cover! You can attach your own toys to it, so his favorites come with us everywhere, and the toys that come with it are ""somewhat"" entertaining. It covers even the largest carts (i.e. Sams Club, CostCo), down to the little dining chairs in restaurants. It has been washed several times and holds up wornderfully! It's great, we love it."
3,Microban...?,Has anyone researched the chemical triclosan..brand name Microban? It seems the Fda has labeled it a pesticide and carcinogenic. I urge any users of this product to research Triclosan and microban.
2,WWE Unforgiven 2000,"This PPV was fair, but for the most part, it was rather boring. The return of Stone Cold Steve Austin was sort of interesting, as he searches for the person who ran him down with the automobile a year earlier at the 1999 Survivor Series. I like the part where Austin delivers 3 stunners to Shane McMahon in the ring and drinks beer. That was cool. Otherwise, the rest of this PPV stunk. Don't waste your money on this. Buy something else."
2,oh yeah austin is back 4 good by joe brown,i remember watchin da highlights of this ppv during my bro's 9th birthday and i am happy 2 say it felt more like my birthday than his birthday because austin came back and raised pearl harbor on steve blackman by giving him a stunner and he give shane mcmahon a stunner not once not twice but 3 times other highlights of da ppv was when i saw angle suplexing hhh from 1 table to da other was i thought was very cool and i saw some of da highlights of da cage match when e and c co chair shot 1 of da hardys from da top of da cage and where jeff da a twisted flip like move off da top of da cage da match looked 2 b a very good match da mainevent match between da rock vs chris benoit vs undertaker vs kane da fued between da four was booked very well 2 make this a real good match which had da rock retain his title but da next month he would drop da title 2 angle so angle could experience maineventing as da wwf champ for da next 4 months
3,WWF UNFORVIVEN 2000,"THIS WAS AN OK WWF PAY-PER-VIEW. TRIPLE H TAKING ON KURT ANGLE WAS THE BEST MATCH OF THE NIGHT. ANOTHER GOOD MATCH WAS THE STEEL CAGE MATCH FOR THE TAG TITLES BETWEEN THE HARDYZ AND EDGE AND CHRISTIAN. THE FINAL GOOD MATCH WAS THE FATAL FOUR-WAY MATCH FOR THE WWF CHAMPIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ROCK, UNDERTAKER, KANE, AND CHRIS BENOIT. THE OTHER MATCHES WERE BORING."
5,"WWF Unforgiven, all that needs to be said","WWF Unforgiven is definitely going to be a top card of the year 2000. Lots of grudge matches, debuts, and returns. Stone Cold Steve Austin is back! Matches include: 1-8 man tag match: Acolytes&Dudleyz vs. Right to Censor 2-Leather Strap Match: Tazz vs. Jerry ""the King"" Lawler. This is the match where Raven makes his WWF debut. 3-Open Invitational for the Hardcore Championship: Steve Blackman vs. Crash Holly vs. Perry Saturn vs. Funaki vs. Al Snow 4-Chris Jericho vs. X-Pac5-Intercontinental Championship: Rikishi vs. Eddie Guerrero w/ Chyna 6-Steel Cage match for the Tag Team Championship: Edge&Christian vs. Hardyz 7-Before/after matches are clips of Stone Cold Steve Austin searching for his assailant. 8-Triple H vs. Kurt Angle 9-Fatal Fourway for the WWF Championship: Kane vs. Undertaker vs. Chris Benoit vs. The Rock"
3,WWF Unforgiven 2000,"The WWF had some hot ppv streak going in 2000 with the exception of the KOTR. When this ppv rolled around everybody had high hopes but the WWF failed to deliver. Matches and opinions of ratings.1) Dudley Boyz & APA vs. Right to Censor - *2) Strap Match: Jerry Lawler vs. Tazz - 1/2*3) Hardcore Invitational: Steve Blackman vs. Al Snow vs. Crash vs. Test vs. Saturn vs. Funaki - *4) X-Pac vs. Chris Jericho - **1/45) Tag-Team Championship, Cage Match: Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - ***6) Intercontinental Championship: Rikishi vs. Eddie Guerrero - DUD7) Kurt Angle vs. Triple H - ***8) WWF Championship: The Rock vs. Chris Benoit vs. Kane vs. Undertaker - ***"
4,...deserves another listen,"I have to admit that I was a little skeptical when I first heard the tracks from this group...and then I saw them live a couple of nights ago - THEY BLEW MY MIND. Sometimes it takes a live performance to really appreciate the direction the band is going. Needless to say, I am no longer skeptical; I truly appreciate the artistry that is Mono."
3,Creativity in Monochrome,"With each new album, it's becoming a bit harder to know what to make of Mono. The first time I heard them, I couldn't help but be impressed - their influences (Mogwai, Godspeed, Moricone) may have been easy to spot, but the skill with which they welded them together was, by all accounts, pretty awe-inspiring. Thing is, there's only so far you can go with the whole soft-loud-soft post-rock thang - and ""Walking Cloud..."" finds Mono squirming in a straightjacket of their own making. All the elements from their first two albums - gorgeous washes of FX-drenched guitar, meditative lulls giving way to explosions of noise, etc. etc. - are intact (and, truth be told, sounding better than ever), but what's crucially lacking is, well, something fresh to chew on. As churlish at it feels to say it, when confronted with music as monumental and impeccably-executed as this, I'll say it anyway: ho-hum, more of the same."
5,Hush Puppies - Slip Ons,Bought this for my 85 year old uncle who couldn't find a good price in local stores. He was pleased with the price and delivery time. Fit great. Nothing different from what he could have bought in a local store and paid more money.
5,Good quality shoes,"Ordered size seven for left foot and size thirteen for right foot, both fit perfectly! I will order the same sizes when I need to replace this pair."
5,Fantastic!!!!!!!,"Sorry, i'm french and my english is very limited. I just can say that this album is a pearl; yes, a pearl, really."
4,When we were kids...,"Much of this album sounds like the work of kids. Especially the two [out-of-date] keyboards on Madness in my Area. The sound here brilliantly recalls pre-60s, nay pre-analogue, recording--the songs are jumpy(Psycho Mafia) or edgy (cf. ""Various Times""--a chilling tune about the dangers of apathy). Elsewhere, Rowche Rumble sounds like a giant sized carnival ride-like music making machine--with very relevant lyrics about pharmaceutical companies medicating the bored. And of course, there's Repetition, the band's blueprint for it's early sound. The great thing about the Fall is they're funny and angry at the same time."
5,loves blank paper,"It arrived on time. The price less than any other website. It was in perfect and since I love large books of blank paper, I was very please!"
3,Interesting take on Big & Rich,"I am a huge Big & Rich fan, but not a huge bluegrass fan. Still this album offers some very intersting interpretations of Big & Rich songs that I found myself really enjoying. All the songs are instrumentals and stay true to the original, so feel free to sing along when you hear them at the next barn dance. Yee haw y'all."
3,It needs polishing,You can't use this product with no polishing. Its texture looks different from the wood. Otherwise it is OK. m
2,Not Suited for Kindle,"Somewhat outdated (says the unit of currency is escudo). But the text of this book relies heavily on descriptions of the geography, which is difficult to imagine without having a map in front of you. The time line which he uses to summarize the history uses inconsistent fonts (some entries are large and readable) but then there are others that are too tiny to read unless you make the standard font size huge. Since this is rather pricey for a Kindle book, I really recommend just getting the hardcover version so that you can see maps, photos, and more!"
2,Big disappointment,"I'm sorry to say that fans of this classic album by Minnie Riperton will unfortunately still have to wait for a decent release. I don't know what source Varese Sarabande used, but there are pops and clicks throughout this recording. Whereas the sound quality is certainly improved over the horrendous windmill version, I don't see why they couldn't have used a clean-up program to remove much of this vinyl noise or whatever it is. And the liner notes even say ""digitally remastered."" Beware!!!On a positive note, Varese did reissue this album with its original cover artwork, along with a great innersleeve pic of Minnie. The only difference is that, for some reason, they chose to use a different font on the lettering. All things considered, this release still blows away the one with the windmill cover."
3,Beautiful Sound in This Garden,"I love Minnie Ripertons voice. It's too bad she wasn't given more high quality song arrangements to sing in her lifetime. There are standouts in her career, don't get me wrong, but that voice deserved more. This album is very good if you already like Minnie Riperton. It is in an R&B genre with just a little tilting toward art Rock. As a fan backtracking thru her career I was a little disapointed because I didn't find any big wows on this album. It's uniformly good, but nothing stands out to me. I have to be in certain moods for it. So if your a Riperton fan this will probably satisfy you, but it is not a keeper on general greatest albums lists. The voice is beautiful, enjoy as much of it as you can."
5,Minnie rips into Dionne's world.,"The solo debut of Minnie Riperton is perhaps the best attempt at copying the classic Dionne sound. The recording was produced by Charles Stephney,Chess Record label producer who would later work with Earth, Wind & Fire.From beginiing to end the LP sounds like a tribute to the musical genius of Burt Bacharach with vocals inspired by Dionne Warwick. Minnie, ofcoursegoes to heights that Warwick never could reach. Still, Stephney guided her to mimic Dionne in her vocal delivery. At the time of this LP's release, 1969, Warwick was the leading female record seller in the US. So, Stephney must have thought to give the public more of what they were already buying. The album still holds up after all these years. I suggestbuying the digially remastered version of this obscure LP. Prior releases were badly made copies from old records and audio tapes."
4,Great Collection,"For those of you who are luke warm about opera (like me), but don't want to miss any of the incredible overtures and preludes that accompanied Verdi's masterworks, then this disc is for you. Twelve preludes and overtures from a variety of operas, including the magnificent pieces from ""La Traviata,"" are collected on this disc. The performances are first rate on this recent digital recording by the La Scala Philharmonic Orchestra, under the leadership of Riccardo Muti. I enjoyed this disc so much, I am looking forward to checking out ""Volume 2,"" not to mention (gasp) a Verdi Opera."
2,Underplayed and underwhelming,"The notes are all there, but these are distinctly tepid and inexpressive runthroughs; entirely too polite, ironically for the theatre orchestra that has these operas in its lifeblood, having debuted most of them. I suggest that Muti is bored with it all. Amazingly, the lyric parts have no soul, although the conductor does whoop things up somewhat for the loud, fast parts. He comes to life briefly for Act 3 of Traviata, his emotions finally engaged. In short, this program doesn't add up to a satisfying musical experience. Pass."

3,"small book, big story.","Duke was a ledgend. his story was that of a important man of his place and time, he influenced so much hawiian culture into the rest of the world. I thought the book a bit breif."
2,"Computed Tomography, physical principles, clinical applications and quality control","This book has a wealth of information on CT. It is intended for the serious, hard core CT tech or Doctor who would like to know the intricate in's and outs' of CT. There are many pages of equations used to derive the intricacies of the CT process. What this book is NOT is a good review text for the CT registry. The information is there, but it is extremely hard to find because the Index is limited in scope. For example, looking for ""Pixel"" in the index turns up nothing. ""Voxel"" likewise turns up nothing. I realize these are very basic terms, and any tech looking to take the registry should know these by heart, but it is indicative of the lack in the index. Other terms that one would like to brush up on are also not there. If I were to do it over again, I would not buy this book to review for the CT Registry. otto"
3,Needs to be updated!!- Overall good for 2001.,"The book if very informative overall. Great look into physics formulas. However, it had a bad tendency of misusing or not clarifying terms. CURRENT Convolution/Fourier transform needs to be expanded. Furthermore, the book jumped around a lot. It would begin to describe a concept...stop... then complete the idea in a later chapter. The books limit is on 4 slice scanners. Since it was published in 2001, there is no mention of 16-64 slice scanners. When it came down to discussing modern equipment, the text very fell short. It is full of great pictures. I found more useful info off of the Siemens website.This would be a great book if it were current.I am going to buy: Computed Tomography : Fundamentals, System Technology, Image Quality, Applications (Hardcover)by Willi A. KalenderIt looks more promising.ETA"
1,"Poor author, vague and non desciptive chapters.",This is the worst text book I have ever read. The author is horrible. The sequence of chapters seems scattered and the goal of each chapter is not apparent. It reads in a vague and non descriptive manner and this book does not guide your education in any way.
3,pretty good for CT registry prep,used this book for CT registry review....scored pretty well.... There is alot of info in this book that is not useful and some that is not explained very well. Would definitely recommend Registry Review in CT by DeMaio...it was alot of help in preparing to take the test.
2,helped me pass the registry on first attempt,this book explains very simply the why's of basic ct.it answers alot of the questions others don't know concerning physics and basic scanning principles.
4,Good Reference,"Hi,I work at a small hospital with a small radiology department that just added CT. So these reference books are great to have on hand"
4,Need for Class,"I am using this book for a class. It arrived promptly and safely. Book seems to be a little repetitious, but maybe I need that to help in studding the subject."
1,This book is terrible!,This book is terrible. It rambles on about topics and then says we don't even use them in CT. So why did I just read all that? The parts that I feel could use more discussion are barely touched. I do not recommend this book.
4,BE A C.T. KNOW IT ALL...,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK TO HAVE AS A REFERENCE SOURCE FOR THE ADVANCED C.T. BOARDS AND FOR FUTURE USE . USED IT TO PREPARE FOR THE EXAM AND PASSED IT THANKS TO THE THOROUGH EXPLANATIONS OF ALL THE PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES ASSOCIATED WITH COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY. CONSIDER IT THE C.T. BIBLE. IT'S A ""MUST HAVE"" GUIDE IN ANY CAT SCAN DEPARTMENT."
1,Don't waste your Money in this useless book,"Don't waste your Money in this useless book. It does not clarify important concepts and terms, it teaches you what you do not really need to know."
4,The brewing storm,"I actually thought this book was ok. I love the fact that it's THICK! lol. A lot of Charmed books are pretty thin, looking like they were rushed and so the authors just wrote whatever to get it done. The plot was good and since Daryll is used as a main character,it gets 4 stars."
1,"Love Charmed, didn't like Paul Ruditis' writing.","I seem to be the minority as far as reviews go but I found Paul Ruditis' writing to be very choppy. And the characters personalities were off. Piper is not a mushy person, but Paul portrayed her as being very lovey and endearing to the child in this story. I remember when Piper's first son, Wyatt was born and how she felt she could not get close to him. That is not the type of woman who would be motherly to an 11 yr old child she doesn't know. I just had a hard time getting into the book. The writing didn't flow in my opinion and every character was far too sentimental and mushy for their true selves. The worst part in the whole book were the lame and ill-placed bouts of humor. It just didn't flow. I won't be buying another one of Paul Ruditis' works, I find them lacking in talent."
2,"These ""remasters"" are horrible -","Slowly We Rot and Cause of Death are two amazing death metal albums. Roadrunner has issues a lot of these 2 for 1 packages (suffocation, gorguts, etc...), and to be honest, its a rip off. The inserts have nothing new, and its just 1 piece of papaer with no additonal information; not even a band history has been added. It really just a waste. If you already own these two albums, there is no need to pick this up. Also, I notice no difference in the sound compared to the original CD's."
5,GREAT OLD-SCHOOL DEATH METAL!!!,"Obituary was one of the main DM bands to come out of Florida in the late 80's- early 90's. They disbanded for a while, but recently got back together & released another album, ""Frozen in Time,"" which I hear is actually pretty good. But I guarentee it DOES NOT beat either of these 2 masterpeices... I don't know which one of these I like better. I'd have to say at 1st I liked ""Cause of Death"" better, but I've been listening to ""Slowly We Rot"" again lately, & it's just as good. I recommend this ""2 From the vault"" double pack because you get BOTH of their original classics remastered and for the same price as you'd pay for just one of them by themselves. Great DM here, get on the ball & get it man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Two great metal albums for one great price!,"I just finished up my reviews of ""Slowly We Rot"" and ""Cause of Death"", but this packaging is how I got both albums. These are two extreme metal classics and are worth checking out if you're a fan of heavier metal. Obituary proves what a great band they are here, with the first album, ""Slowly We Rot"" being rawer and more stripped-down, like an edgier Slayer, and ""Cause of Death"" shows the band delving into more progressive, technical and classically-influenced death metal. Both albums are truly great, and at a price like this, you're gonna be on a dark and twisted path to headbanging in no time! Thanks for the time, and peace."
4,Elegant!,"A must read for everyone interested in Light. It explains everything - dual nature of light, polarization, diffraction, interference, colours, light as vibration of the fifth dimension, etc. Is useful both for the layman and the expert reader. The book's simplicity is its biggest advantage. From simplicity arises elegance."
1,junk,I tried these on my art/craft display canopy. All four easily bent over at the hammer end. They did go in by continued smashing at the bent over end.They might be good for soft sand or mud. All went direct into the garbage.
1,A SAD END TO A GREAT CAREER.,"Dame Joan's earlier recordings are fantastic, but this last recording was a mistake. Her glorious high notes are all gone and her voice is a shambles. I wish that she had retired before this ill-conceived recording was made."
2,Simply too late - sad,"If this were recorded 20 years earlier we could have had not THE Anna Bolena but yet another amazing recording of this opera. Truly extraordinary Annas are rare, there is Callas (1957), Gencer (1958) and Sills (Whose voice was, IMHO, too light for the part) and that's about it. Good Annas would be Scotto (live) and Marisa Galvany. (Also live) Sutherland didn't do herself a favour by recording this so late, even her performance on video (several years sooner) is transposed down and rather weak. Having Ramey as VIVID Henry and Mentzer as LUSCIOUS Giulietta (My fave right after Simionato) doesn't make it easier for La Stupenda. This is one of the few Sutherland-recordings one should skip."
2,A correction,"Since Amazon won't let me edit my previous review at present: Mentzer is singing GIOVANNA of course, please excuse my typo! I was thinking of GIULIETTA Simionato (My favourite Giovanna) and thus the error occured. Sorry!"
2,WAY PAST HER PRIME,"I am sorry to say that this recording should never have been made with Joan Sutherland. I love her younger recordings, but she just didn't age well, I will give her an A+ for effort, I mean she still throws out the high notes (as pinched and ugly that they are) even gives us a high e flat at the end of the mad scene. But Joan was just too old at this point to do the role justice. If you want a well accomplished recording turn to Beverly Sills, she mastered this role and recorded it in the prime of her wornderful voice. Don't waste your money on this recording unless you just love Dame Joan so much you have to have all that she recorded to the bitter end."
2,A diva well past her sell by date,Pass this recording up and head for Beverley Sills version. Sutherland is past it vocally. Her voice sounds dry and she has a problem holding the upper register for longer than a second or two. Boynage also conducts without enthusiasm a lack lustre performance. Beverley Sills may not have a weighty voice but she was at the peak of her game and is hands down better than Dame Joan.
1,Cheap,"When I opened the box on this unit I know it was a really cheap item. We have gone through several peak flow meters and this is by far the worst.It was covered by insurance, but it won't work properly the tab doesn't move accurately. My fear is that someone who is just learning about asthma will get a hold of this horrible item and they won't be able to accurately tell what is happening with their peak flow. I'm throwing it away and paying for a high quality one."
1,The movable gauge is a cheap piece of plastic that is inaccurate,"I bought this item from a CVS Pharmacy at the recommendation of my allergist. When I used the peak flow monitor, it gave a reading a of 750 (the max), and I was all like: ""My allergist kicks a--. The regimen she gave me is working."" I used it several more times to see if it was correct. It continued to read the maximum. Normal for my age/height is about 550. I used it again, blowing a soft puff of air, it still read close to the maximum. Full disclosure: I am pretty sure the item was defective and may not be representative of all of them. But the plastic dial looks to be made from cheap and flimsy plastic, that would be easily manipulated if someone across the room sneezed. Fortunately I was able to return it. Given the other bad reviews, instead of getting a replacement, I've decided to research other options."
1,"Save your money, don't buy this product","Like the other reviewers, I too wish I had done some research before buying this at our local medical supply store. I bought the children's version. It is a very cheap product and the tab broke off after one day.One thing I would add is that it was very disheartening to my 8-year old when his reading was so low. As others have written, it tended to be 60-80 points lower than other meters. Part of the idea as to why I got this was to have him feel in control of his asthma by being a part of the monitoring. However, this cheap product and its inaccurate readings made him feel worse cause his readings were so low.Skip this one, not just because of the money but also because it could start you off on the wrong foot with your child for daily/weekly peak flow monitoring."
5,Pleasant sweet music.,My first thought was how much it sounds like the Beatles but with an up-to-date modern sound.
5,One of the best albums I've heard this year!!!!!!,"Yeah I'm saying that because I know the band personally and I have to. But if I didn't, I'd say it anyway. Brandon (the lead singer and main songwriter) has always written great songs and Chris (guitarist and other great writer) never cease to amaze me. I'm glad someone finally recognized the band's talent and hope that the album goes to number 1. You should purchase the record now and hear for yourself."
1,Oh dear lord...,"For starters, I don't own many bad albums. I had one Depeche Mode album I wasn't too keen on, so I gave it to a friend. But this...for obvious reasons, I can't seem to unburden myself of this album. This is just bad music. Every song gives the impression that these guys are trying so desperately to be something that they're not. And they just can't pull it off. I mean, are they supposed to be a rock band? Or some kind of indie band cultist addiction? Or are they just garage boys who took their whining to the studio? I am ashamed to say that this is one CD I got suckered into buying because I liked one song, ""Crawl,"" as played by the WB some years ago. If you like that song, just download it. No need to spring the most useless eighteen bucks you'll ever spend on this aggrevating piece of plastic."
2,made me break out like crazy,"I didn't take this product long enough to experience any benefits but 1-2 weeks after taking this I had broken out in painful, devastating (people would actually ask me what was wrong with my face) acne along my chin, jawline, and neck. It was the worst breakout of my life (I'm 26) and it took a couple of weeks to start to calm down. From my googling (CLA + acne) it looks like this is a fairly common occurrence. Beware!"
1,Dont waste your money on Iron Tek,"I ordered Iron Tek cla and it does not work at all. I have been taking Vitamin Shoppe tonalin and thought I would try this brand. More pills less money , hahaha so I thought. Taking the vitamin shoppe brand you can tell the very first day its working. I took 8 Iron Tek cla in one day nothing . Don't waste your money , don't think becuse of no tax , no shipping its worth it... ITS NOT.."
4,works!!!!!!,This product works well with Raspberry Ketones. With a balance workout you will notice the difference.This was cheaper then my prior purchases
2,Disappointed,"This product made me feel weird, physically. I wasted my hard earned money...i could have paid for another month at the gym for this lesson. Very disappointed that it isn't anything that benefits me or my health."
3,Decent,This book is decent. Every chapter is a different story of girls that are held captive around the world. Each chapter is fairly short (10 - 20 pages) and only gives a quick version and not many details. This book is alright but almost reads like a book report.
2,Slave Girls,"The book did not have enough information to make it interesting. Very short stories on modern slavery in a civilized (?) world. It makes you wonder what makes some people feel they have the right to rule someone else. I felt like its stories were just ""SAME CRIME""...""DIFFERENT DAY"". Did not hold my interest."
2,"Kind of like a sampler, but not much else.",This is light reading about a very complex subject. Each terrible tale asks more questions than it tells. I can't imagine that this book was meant to be anything other than a cheap thrill.
2,64 oz Lamp Oil,"Be careful when you place this order. The description says 64 oz. Clear Original Lamp Oil. You have to look down into the product description at the bottom of the page to see it's sold as a 6-Pack, not 1 ea. I'm not sure when I'll use 6 bottles of lamp oil. My issue is not with the product itself but the way it's described on Amazon.com."
1,"Software has problems, company won't support","Have had a number of problems with this software, from the early days of purchase. Was never able to get support from the vendor (Intervideo) and finally my version of the software went past it's ""end of life"" for support. So now they offer me ""buy our latest version"" as a fix for the problem. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... (not going to happen)"
1,Past performance not a guarantee of future results...,"I owned the predecessor to this system, also from Lorex. I used it with a TiVo, to use my TiVo (series 1) on another TV. The remote IR extender was critical to our use. The old system wore out from heavy use. I needed to replace it. I figured buying the same brand was a no-brainer.This new system's IR extender is incompatible, apparently, with the TiVo. It works fine for controlling other things like the TV, but not the TiVo. Also, the picture quality is very poor, despite attempts to move it all over to different locations. I am extremely disappointed."
1,good idea that dosen't even work half as good as stated,"I purchased this product for rv to watch satellite outside at campsite. the video works good but audio has a lot of problems. If you get audio to work video rolls alot.range is very limited at best 25' says it will get 300' clear site. In my rv window (open no screen) sitting 15'-20' away had to constantly fiddle with reciever and transmitter to get it to work. Easier to run cable out window! like I said if it worked HALF as good as they say, it would be ok but unfornatly, I will send this back I probably will get charged shipping both ways so BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT!!!"
4,Great Read,"This was a very good book the characters were likeable and real. There was drama humor and sexy parts in the book, but I felt the hero and heroine spent too much time trying to dislike each other. I would have given the book five stars if the dislike wasn't dragged on for longer than I thought necessary.The conclusion was one of the best I've read from HP (starting from when the brothers visit). Recommended Read"
5,Instant exhilaration combined with sensations of peace!,"You can feel the inspiration of this truly gifted artist in his music. It's a must in everyone's collection; it must be experienced! It allows me to take that much needed ""mental vacation"" that so many of us require at times!"
4,Various Artists with Various Sounds,"Trance Pioneers should be dance pioneers. While the set is composed of four discs, half are what I would consider the precursor or today's trance sound, the others as the label makes reference to are the beginnings of ""housier type tracks."" Now don't get me wrong there is alot to like and the price...thirty-seven tracks for about 20 smackers to you door. A definite deal!! Some tracks will truly get your feet and hands tappin' but some will sound their age and wear you out. The selection as a whole are above average and once auditioned you will surely find your faves. Bet your money on tracks 1/7/8 on disk three, sure fire winners."
4,Great Basic,"Any child should have a starter set of wooden blocks. It provides a great alternative to all of the plastic toys, and these are the nicest I have seen in a while. The colors are fun and the decoration is great. They also come in other languages and characters.Perfect for the beginning stacker, they are durable and we will use them for years to come. The one downside is the chewability....just watch out for teething."
3,Level 4 too fast,"Wow! I thought my 11 month old daughter was an aggressive eater, but she's not aggressive enough for this nipple. Not sure what baby can chug-a-lug that fast. I had to go back and buy level 3s, which are perfect."
4,Tricky trick,"I think this was one of Holmes's trickiest tricks on Watson. I think the narrator ruins the whole film! She says a sentence every time someone talks! This is about a woman who comes to Holmes saying she thinks her husband's cousin is trying to get control of the large and vast property they have. Coverton Smith, the cousin is an expert on a type of horrible fevor. When the husbad dies, the wife becomes suspicious. Smith says his cousin died of the fevor! Find out what happens!"
1,Not the Best,"Jeremy Brett was by this time indeed ""the dying detective,"" but his real-life condition in no way helps this tedious and undramatic rendition of one of Conan Doyle's more tasteless Holmes stories. The original features some of Holmes' worst and most insensitive treatment of poor Watson, but since this series made such a thing of their friendship, the adapters have a heck of a time getting around it. Stick with the Brett episodes from the mid-80s, when he was fresh in the role and the adaptations were true and intelligent."
4,A good overview to a spectacular park,"Olympic National Park rangers often recommend this book as the best overall guide to this intriguing wilderness region. With environments as diverse as wavespept Pacific coasts, glaciated alpine country and lush temperate rainforests, McNulty had his work cut out for him in capturing the essence of the Olympic Mountains. All in all, he has done an excellent job, hitting on these topics, as well as the human history and conservation issues of the region. I was disappointed with his coverage of the rainforests, whose stunning grandeur really deserves more than the brief chapter he gives them. To his credit,though, he concludes the book with an extensive bibliography that will satisfy anyone who wants to delve deeper. All in all, I would say that this book earns a home in the backpack or suitcase of anybody who plans on visiting this wonderful National Park."
1,Breaks easily,"The quality of this product is very bad. The plastic stem attached to the ball breaks off easily. I installed it and gave it a pull to close the drain and the plastic stem broke on the first pull. I used the same force that I would normally use to pull the drain lever up. Apparently, this product was never field tested before it was distributed."
1,Wrong Item,I order a Babolat Pro Hurricane Tour but instead I received a Babolat Pro Hurricane which is different from what I order. I even contact the seller but no response.
4,Understanding Buddhism,"Although this book provides a lot of insight into the mystery of life it all boils down to the opening statement which is something similar to: ""To know everything is to know that you know nothing at all."" Although I'm still skeptical of the disneyland theory of gnosticism, I think that this book would make an excellent companion for those that are interested in Buddhism. I myself had no clear understanding of buddhism when I began reading this book, by the time I was done I could understand what used to seem alien.Buddhism itself teaches that desires create suffering. So the question is how do you end your desires, better yet, how do you go about starting such a quest. I reccomend beginning by reading this book, with a respectfully skeptical opinion but still with an open mind. Remember the book does talk negatively of the ""Hard Core"" spiritual crowd, and if there are any lessons to be learned it is not to cement your beliefs, really you never know."
1,I couldn't finish this mess!,"This book is definitely NOT on par with those by Karen Armstrong and Elaine Pagels. I agree with other reviewers who note that the research is full of holes and the organization is a mess. Worst of all, on several occasions, Bible verses quoted made no sense or were used totally out of context. The book totally lacked credibility for me.I am not a Biblical literalist, but I cannot accept the concept that the ENTIRE life of Jesus was a myth. How can the authors say that Jesus never lived, but Paul did, yet claim that some of Paul's letters were forged? Maybe ALL of Paul's letters were forged. This stretched credibility too far for my beliefs. There are better books on Gnosticism out there. Skip this one."
2,""" A Lean Feast ""","To read this book will not open your eyes. If they are already open you will find this book keeps the mysteries safe, for it reveals no new knowledge. As Lao-Tzu observes, 'Those who know do not say and those who say do not know'. The style is akward and it's difficult to find the tempo. The best thing about it are the footnotes, these would have enriched the text if they had been included in the telling as the story was written. All up it seems rushed and could do with more editing, since it is an interesting subject and exposes the false premise 'religion' brings to the action of men. Especially in today climate of double standards, of both the political and secular instutions. Disappointing."
1,Trying too Hard,"This is the only book I started, but never finished. Plainly, this book sucked and I'm not saying that because it offended me or my religion, I just didn't like it and thought it was poorly written. The authors seem to be trying way too hard and any research they have done appears to be skewed and not very supporting. I say if you walk by this book on the shelf, keep on walking."
1,Sounds like...,"Heresy to me. As a matter of fact the first Christians did not teach that Jesus was YHWH the Creator, nor that Mary was a 'godess'."
4,Good Information,"This book is packed with facts about Vasco da Gama and offers quite a bit of incidental information on what sea voyages were like at that time. My one complaint is that the book seems dense with information, the pages packed from top to bottom with type, and at times transitions between paragraphs just aren't there. Nevertheless, a book worth reading."
1,pathetic Brahms,"The Julliard of 1995 was no match for its earlier ensembles of the late 40s into the 70s. This disc shouldn't have been issued. The Raphael Ensemble's recording on Hyperion, also from 1995, is superb."
1,Julliard butchers Brahms,"In response to sonofviagra, what you are missing is Brahms, beauty, warmth, and sensitivity. The Julliard, famous for its technical virtuosity, seems in this recording to be not an interpretation of so much as an attack on the music."
3,Only the faithfull will like,"The songs were originally demo songs made in the very early seventies. Several songs are recognizable as later hits. The muscians are mainly Becker and Fagan only. They give you a real feel of how there music originated and evolved. They do not sound like the more produced later versions, but still enjoyable. Only for persons who appreciate their music and want to expore their beginnings."
2,Missed Opportunity,"Didn't buy it based on other reviews, but listened to all the demo snippits diligently. It seems to me that this could have been a really, really good unplugged album if it were designed that way and arranged and sung in the current day rather than voices from the past, from the cutting room floor."
5,"TEACHERS, PROFESSORS, ANS INSTRUCTORS","A fascinating 137 pages of teaching plans for The Miracle Worker by William Gibson conveniently stored on a CD Rom refreshed my outlook on how to teach The Miracle Worker. With each Act there is pre-reading material, study questions, vocabulary (in an assortment of ways), and tests in different formats, such as, multiple choice, short answer, and essay type questions. Plus, there is an exhaustive list of writing ideas and discussion activities to promote critical thinking. In addition to all of this, there are games, activities, and puzzles for various levels of students. An impressive CD that transformed my approach."
3,A brave new world in our future?,"Earth Rising is an important book about military technology and it's effects on our culture and freedom.Do top secrect, high tech goverment projects such as weather control, biometrics, electronic survalance and mind contol threaten our freedom and way of life?Earth rising by Dr. Nick Begich and James Roderick is a well researched book that explores the frighting possobilities in modern technology.Earth Rising raises many important issues that must be openly and honestly debated if we are to remain a free and democratic society. Earth Rising , however is at times overly technical and boring to read dimishing the impact of this important subject matter. Hopefully in the near furture we will see more clearly writen books on this important issue."
1,Hard to read,"This book was very hard read. The tech. terms were hard to follow .If I had a degree, maybe I could have followed along better. He should have explain some of the big terms. To help people understand these trems."
3,"Earth Rising: The Revolution, Toward a Thousand Years of Pea",for the reviewer's defence. Practicing the review process helps one become more critical.
4,CM's Best Since Human Emergency,"Tight beats, dope lyrics, orthodox theology. An excellent conclusion to the canon of these trailblazers of Christian Hip-Hop."
5,THE book on recovering from trauma,"This is the one book you need if you are searching for solutions to problems you have arising from childhood trauma (for example, unexplainable fear, uncontrollable anger and rage, debilitating depression, substance abuse, and so on). Middleton-Moz is insightful and genuinely helpful both in describing the results of childhood trauma in adults and in suggesting strategies for dealing with the underlying issues and healing from the trauma. If you are searching for something along any of these lines, do yourself a favor and buy this book."
2,"Stories, Stories and More","Unfortunately, I was very disappointed to read again and again about accounts of others problems without in depth and practical ways to look at my own past and find resolutions for overcoming issues that were left neglected in my own childhood.With each story or account of others pasts, I was left more confused, more frustrated and found that the book didn't give any real meat I could use toward Rediscovering my Discarded Self.Needless to say, I'm finished with the book and am still left wanting to know how to heal my past wounds."
3,Good for the price,"I was super excited when I received this product. The hat and booties were adorable. The hat fit great. The booties, however, have yet to stay on my daughter's feet. The design of the booties make them easy to come off, so I have stopped using them. I am not too disappointed as I did not pay much for the products."
3,Ok looking,"I don't this its as cute as it appears in the pictures. Its acceptable looking with the color being on the duller side. The booties are too big and oddly shaped. They don't stay on my newborn for 5 seconds even, they just slip right off coz they are so loose and odd shaped."
5,Cute,This product is super cute and washes very well! I plan on buying the yellow version of this hat! I recommend it!
2,Overrated,"I treasure a number of Solti's opera recordings. This is not one of them. The casting is all wrong-headed. Domingo does not sound idiomatic singing in German. Norman's voice is too rich for the virginal Elsa. Solti's conducting is earthbound for this most ecstatic of dramas. If you want a lyrical Lohengrin, look for Konya. If you want an incomparable Elsa, listen to Grummer. If you seek visionary conducting, try Kempe. If you want Solti at his best, purchase his Ring. Otherwise, ignore this overblown, overrated set."
4,Bluegrass both modern and traditional,"I first encountered the Meat Purveyors through the song ""Thinking About Drinking"" (from the album All Relationships Are Doomed To Fail), yet decided to explore them first through this album, not able to pass up a bluegrass album with a Talking Heads reference in the title. I was surprised to find that, by my standards (at least), the Meat Purveyors are very much rooted in traditional bluegrass. Some purists might object to some of the stuff here, but the hauting ""Travel & Toil"" and ""Morning After"" show a real mastery of the genre. Not that they'll let themselves be forced into a corner; their cover of ""We Kill Evil,"" a punk tune which sounds, in the Meat Purveyor's talented hands, as much a gospel number as left-wing manifesto, ends the album on a delighfully surreal note. Not every song works, but there is a lot to like here."
1,Filter bag doesn't fit Shop-Vac 2860010 Backpack Vacuum,"This bag was recommended by Amazon for the Shop-Vac 2860010 Backpack Vacuum. IT DOESN'T FIT!! The opening of the bag is too small to fit over the ""beak"". I contacted Shop Vac and they were not helpful at all!!! They didn't know which filter bag fits their vacuum? HOW IGNORANT!!!"
5,Best price for this is amazon,"I did an extensive internet search and amazon had the best price. The bags are durable, hold a large amount and dispose easily. I would recommend a genuine shop-vac bag versus a knock off. The quality cannot be beat."
1,Wrong bag!,"I, too, ordered these bags for my Shop Pac vacuum. They are the wrong bags and, for the life of me, I can't find the right ones. They aren't on the Shop Vac site, either. I like the vacuum because I have spiral stairs and I can just take it up and down on my back, but where can I find bags?"
1,"WRONG BAGS - DO NOT BUY FOR ""SHOP PAC""","The bags shown are not the right ones for the Shop Pac. Love the vacuum, very disappointed in Amazon for STILL showing the wrong bag, even after all of the reviews."
4,Coordinator of Technical Training,"I have used this book for several classes and I am satisfied with the level of technical information contained in the book. The information is easy to read, understand, and makes a good reference book."
1,Another Dissapointing Divorce CD,"I dont know what happened to the Kenny Loggins I used to love. This is just another winathon over another x-wife. I cant find anything in it to recommend.Any favorable reviews that are made here, probably will be from die-hard fan club members, who cant bring themselves to admit that this is just not anything special. Kenny, please, bring back the music that used to keep you on my stereo for hours.We are sick of hearing about your problems."
4,Wow! Great overall view w/ great visuals!,I was pleasantly surprised with how 'unboring' the overview was. WONDERFUL clear visuals with simple and complete explanations/history. I will even show this to my elementary students! I was really wowed with the attention to detail in the visuals and explaing the paintings.
5,The Best of its kind,I have a whole rack of cookbooks in my kitchen and none is used more than this book. Every recipe has turned out to be a grand success. You do need to have access to Mexican ingredients as many of the recipies call for a few exotic ingredients. You will not be disappointed in this cookbook however.
5,"Authentic, expansive and informative","For the last 15 years, I had been looking to recreate several of the wonderful Mexican dishes I ate while living in Tucson, Arizona for 6 years. It was not until I found The Border Cookbook that I was able to accomplish this task! The authors have made it very easy to cook the wonderful flavors that I have been missing all of these years. The descriptions of the history of the dishes and the detailed explanations of how to cook each recipe make this cookbook one of my favorites!"
4,"Good people, great recipes!",This book has a ton of U.S./Mexican border recipes and has won the accolades of many of the best known chefs of this regional cuisine. Try the Ensenada Tacos de Pescado on P.333(Killer) Bill and Cheryl Alters Jamison have a number of cookbooks on the market and they're all top notch. Check out the mail-order source section on P.485 for those hard to find ingredients.
4,foodie1,An excellent cookbook. Well researched and the recipes all work. I especially enjoyed that there were recipes that are usually hard to find such as Horchata and Diablo Shrimp. I would have given it 5 stars but I think that some pictures of the food would have helped. I guess we get spoiled in today's world by various cookbooks and magazines that inspire us to try a recipe because it looks so delicious in a photo. I would recommend it based on the quality of the recipes though.
5,Incredible!,"The reviewer that criticized Freni doesn't know anything about singing. Freni can sing circles around Tebaldi. This is the best Boheme available. However, get the complete recording. You won't want to miss anything!"
3,Pavarotti just passing,Not too impressed with this recording. doesn't seem to be recorded correctly or it was simply not edited very well. The stereo/stage effects really detract from the recording. I will be looking for other productions.Just not impressed.
2,Lame if you know salsa,"This video is informative however it really really isn't salsa. Its more like Latin inspired pop moves. I'm a beginner at salsa and thought this would be an interested way to add variation in my dancing. But the whole first half of the video were things that ANYone that knows like ANYthing about salsa would know. Then the second half has steps that are salsa inspired but don't fit the dance.So if your going to a salsa club for like one night and want to have some introduction then get the dvd, If you are GENUINELY interested in learning salsa, do yourself a favor and pass. Take a class instead that way you'll know what to expect with a partner."
4,Profound and beautifully written,"This book creates both questions and answers, movingly and beautifully written by one of the finest writers I know. All of Price's thoughtful imagination and intelligence come to bear on three dialogues that one can easily see might have taken place. A profound and exciting read."
1,"STALE, STALE, STALE!!!","I took a chance on ordering the licorice allsorts from Amazon assuming that because they had just started selling this item last week I would have a good chance of getting a bag of fresh candy. WRONG! This stuff tastes like it has been on someone's shelf for a couple of years and while it is not rock hard yet, it is pretty darn close.I am very disappointed.Update July 13, 2006: A friend of mine ordered some of the Allsorts from Amazon (against my advice) and - big surprise - their order was also stale. It is really too bad because if these allsorts were fresh they would be the best tasting I have ever had. I hope Amazon can get it together and get a fresh batch of these candies because then they would be worthy of a 5 star rating."
4,"Great, for the price","They're maybe not as good as say Basset Allsorts, but for the price, they were excellent. Only thing I didn't like about them was that when eating them, I kept thinking the 'licorice' layers are just licorice flavored gummi candy. Heck, for all I know that is how they make licorice. Didn't say they weren't good, just seemed a little different from regular black licorice."
4,Good Value for the Money,"Gave these a try since it was a huge bag for less than half the price of the others out there. I won't say that they are the best I have ever had, but they were nice. The bag seemed bottomless at over 6 1/2 pounds. They were not stale although the candy part (not licorice) was not as fluffy as other brands. The licorice was nice and soft.If money were no object, I would probably buy Bassett's. But for the quantity of good candy you get for a good price, I will buy this item again."
4,Good stuff,"These are a great deal especially with Prime- shipping discount. Not exactly like the english all sorts but darn close, none of the colored non perils(?). The licorice is milder also."
1,If you like Licorice allsorts candy.................,"If you enjoy Licorice Allsorts, this product is not for you. Although manufactured in England, the candy is a very poor product when compared to the original Bassett's Licorice Allsorts, also manufactured in England. I believethat the Bassett Company is the original creator of Licorice Allsorts some hundred or so years ago, and it remains the very best. I am a one-time buyer of Haribo's product and would not buy it again."
1,Different quality than the German original,"These Haribos (""Licorice All Sorts"") are not Made in Germany but stem from Haribo's production plant in England. The difference in quality is striking. The candy (with an expiration date of 01/2009) is hard, stale, and too sweet if you compare it with the authentic Haribo ""Color-Rado"". Take it from a connaisseur: this is not true Haribo. I would not recommand it."
4,great for the price,"These are tasty candies, and for an American, they are terrific. I was buying them for a British person who was hankering for some of the 'real' licorice All Sorts that come in a tin, or a smaller bag found in some specialty shops. I thought these would be the same thing, since they were listed as All Sorts, but they aren't. They're still good, and you like licorice, you will love them...unless you're from England. Then, they just won't be the same."
1,"Sad, but it was very stale","I'm not sure if these are sitting in a warehouse or something, but they were very stale. I don't recommend ordering them - that is unless you like them stale :)"
1,"disappointing, to say the least","If you think that those are anything like what you know from Germany, please don't order this. I am German born and raised, and i thought i could save my mom some euros ( she usually sends care packages for me and my family to the U.S.) But to be very frank, those are awful, dry, stale and tasteless. i couldn't eat more than 3. there is only one kind of konfect with coconut, the rest is just flavored sugar, yuck! who even produces this? i'm very sad, i was hoping i could buy groceries that i know and love from germany but i'm very hesitant about it now. i better save my money and help out my mom with shipping costs."
2,"AWFUL, AWFUL","THIS CANDY WAS JUST PLAIN AWFUL - THE ONLY TASTY PIECES WERE THE CHUNKS OF PLAIN LICORICE. THE CANDY COVERED ONES WERE TERRIBLE - STALE AND CRUNCHY. I GUESS I PREFER THE ""MADE IN ENGLAND"" ALLSORTS!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS IMPOSTER."
5,very nice,great cd.strongly recommended.i definately suggest samantha grant and jay morgans.samantha's song was lovely.jay morgans voice is very unique.i love complilations. and this is a really nice treat!

4,Rival 8704-RD 4-Quart Ice Cream Maker,"I have made 2 batches of ice cream, to date. So far, I am well pleased with the overall performance. It took about 30 mins. Ice cream was quite firm for this type of maker."
4,Rival 8704-RD 4-Quart Electric Ice Cream Maker,"This ice cream maker is a very good value, and made excellent ice cream. It was purchased as a supplemental ice cream maker to my 30 year old (and still functioning) electric Rival ice cream maker. This family does love ice cream! I would follow the manufacturer's instructions to crush the ice with a hammer before layering it around the metal canister which holds the ice cream mixture. The motor of the Rival 870-RD 4-Quart turns the entire canister instead of the churner like on my old one, and the canister seems a bit frail compared to my old Rival canister. A good reason the ice should not have huge chunks that will dent the canister and/or prevent it from freely turning. Enjoy!"
1,Very difficult to follow and understand,"The publishers of computer books ought to realize that people buy the books to be able to learn a program without having to suffer through technical gobbledygook. This book is written very badly. It is poorly organized. The book's five authors, I get the impression, weren't speaking to one another when they wrote it. The same material is covered in some chapters.I found it extremely difficult to get anything out of this book, because the material is expalined so badly. I do not recommend it."
2,Smackdowns worst ppv!,"This ppv sucked.There were only an couple good matches like The Undertaker vs The Ortons in an casket match,and Batista vs Eddie Guerrerro for the world heavyweight title.The other matches sucked big time and for all you WWE fans why dont you watch some real good ol wrestling like TNA(Total Nonstop Action).Their ppvs are extremely better like Against All Odds which featured Jeff Jarrett vs Kevin Nash for the title,LockDown which featured the return of the six sided steel,and Slammiversary which was Tna's 3 year anniversary ppv.I use to watch the WWE from 2000-present but its now boring and WWE stills has their lame sport/entertainers that hasnt drawn a couple of bucks since E.C.W(Extremely Crappy Wrestling)was in business.Anyway WWE sucks these days and T.N.A(Total Nonstop Action)is the best wrestling yet thats still alive!"
5,Raw is definetly the better brand!,"Listen here Raw has way better superstars than SmackDown such as;Triple H,John Cena,Edge(So what if he whines a lot most Canadians are like that example;Bret Hart.Yes he did whine a lot before he left the WWE in 1997 but so what the guy can wrestle just like Edge can and thats what matters the most)Shelton Benjamin,Kane,Shawn Michaels,and the Big Show.Now SmackDown is not on this level of competiton and who in the heck put Theodore Long in charge of SmackDown?He should of sticked with managing Jazz or better yet stayed a referee.And thats a fact!"

5,HOPEFULLY THE RESULTS OF NO MERCY 2005,"1. JBL def Rey MysterioThis is their fourth rivarly. I hope JBL wins the match when Rey was about to hit West Coast Pop( the ref is getting KO) JBL kicks him with a low blow then hit the Clostine From Hell to win.2.

Then Batista hits the powerbomb on Eddie to win.3. The Undertaker def The OrtonsI hope the Ortons worked together but when they were about to open the casket Kane comes from the casket and helps Undertaker for his victory or The Undertaker will have a victory with a clean win.4. Chris Benoit def Booker T, Orlando, and ChristianI hope three of them works on Christian first, but at the end Christian locked in a Crossface and he taaped."
1,The power isnt really Back,"WWE has it's moments, but I don't know how this DVD is getting so many poistive reviews. The only match that really entertained me was the Casket match, but WWE is starting to come to the point to do the same ""shocking"" thing as they did before. maybe you little kiddies who've only been watching for a couple years dont know this, but at Royal Rumble 1998, Kane did the exact same thing to the Undertaker that Orton did to him here. Lock Taker in a casket, pound a hole in it, pour gas in it, and set it on fire. The exact same thing at rumble 98, only instead of the Ortons setting Takers casket on fire, it was Kane and Paul Bearer. God, WWE is running out of storylines! What luzers! The only other good part aboutthe show was Juventud Gurrera winning the cruiserweigh title, because Juvi is an awesome wrestler."

1,AND,and also undertaker is the least of your worries about o0ld wrestlers if freaking BOB ORTON is wrestling!
1,What a Retarded Kid,"This is a kids review.""""""""""Thanks to the Ortons we will no longer have to see that creep from the dead on SmackDown anymore.He is too old to be wrestling,and Randy Orton is the next best thing to hit SmackDown since an egg wide omelet.So Taker may this be a lesson for you and the rest of the SmackDown brand(Or Raw for that matter because you're not excused either)and next time think about messing with the legend killer! """"""""""""""Okay dude, if you think think that the Undertaker isn't coming back from this, you're mentally retarded. If you'll watch Royal Rumble 98 Kane did the exact same thing lit a casket on fire while Taker was inside and Taker came back less then two months later. also, he's come back from being Buried Alive as well. so if you think Taker is gone your retarded."
1,Not of use to me.,The book probably does have 1OO1 motifs but many were Victorian and so ornate they would be all but impossible to transfer to a greeting card. I would return it but the cost to return would take a large bite out of the cost of the book. Sorry I bought it. May be of use to graphic illustrators with more equipment than I possess.
4,Traditional Designs and Motifs for Artists,"Whether you craft old-fashioned greeting cards or design decorative accessories, this is an invaluable reference of copyright-free floral designs. Ranging from 18th-century classical to Victorian and Art Nouveau, selections include borders, frames, sprays, trophies, drops, swags, bouquets, buds and much more. Images are clean and clear (all are line art, NO half-tones) and can easily be scanned, sized, cropped or even colored.I recognize some of the art to be either directly from, or in the style of, a wide range of milestone artists like Johann Weinmann (18th cen botanicals), Giambattista Pergolesi (17th cen classical motifs), Thomas Bewick (late 18th cen woodcuts), C. F. A. Voysey (Arts and Crafts period), and Alfons Mucha (Art Nouveau), and more.As usual, Dover Publications offers another compendium of artwork that belongs in the library of the artist and craftperson."
4,Open to Possibilities,"Although I have not finished this book, thus far I am appreciative of the courage to take on what we have been taught to believe and not question in structured religion. This must have been an exciting and challenging venture for anyone to have been a part of. I look forward to finishing the book. I, however, wish that the reviews were more focused on the content of the book rather than a spiteful excuse for a ""chat room."" I believe that there are other websites for those purposes. Perhaps Amazon.com could monitor these more closely or request reviews in 50 words or less. There is a difference between opinion and slander."
1,Hilariously bad,"To let the word ""science"" get anywhere near this book proves more about the mumbo-jumbo that authors like this try to pass off as evidence than it does convince the reader of a higher intelligence. People like this are their own worst enemy."
5,Sensible coverage of a Difficult Topic,"Dr. Schwartz uses his education to accurately investigate, with the scientific method, the possibility we are all interconnected with the universe and the G.O.D. process. The results of his research must have been hard for Dr. Schwartz, a former agnostic, to accept. He manages to gather scientific, metaphysical, and psychological evidence to support his thesis; doing so in a convincing and easy to read manner.Some of his theological views could be better if they were based on and supported by those of a conservative religous organization. The poor reviews he received here seem to be that of readers whose stubbornness and pride prevent them from believing in truth. That's a problem such readers will have to attempt to live with and unfortunately to die with."
1,Big Disappointment,"The title and subtitle are false and misleading. The ""experiments"" and the ""science"" are not scientific. The experiences and anecdotes could not be published in refereed professional journals. The scientific community would not accept the claimed results. If only the author had been honest and presented the material as an interesting approach to understanding reality, rather than as an accepted scientific reality, my rating would be higher."
4,good idea,"these are very good, but my 2 year old likes taking them on and off the wall more, and after a few times they are not so sticky anymore and fall off. but if you have an older child, that would just leave them where you put them then they would be great!"
5,MPC2000 user,"This is a must-have and hard-to-find item for all MPC2000 users. This particular set of zip disks was priced well; a tremendous value. I'll buy again, if I ever need another.// hot beets //"
1,A horrible back seat organizer,"It wasn't worth the money. It didn't stay attached like it was supposed to and if you put anything in it, it hangs funny & does sag into passengers legs."
5,Great Album,"This album has a late 90's pop sound, infused with some of the Hawaiian culture. ""Talk Story"" is my mom's favorite song. She loves the conversations in the background pigeon english."
1,Completely Frustrating,"I purchased this for my 11 year old for Christmas. I opened it to download some music so he could use it on Christmas morning. Five days later I had only suceeded in downloading one song, but it wouldn't actually play. Customer service directed me back to their online manuals (useless)Today I bought a Mpio FL100 and within 30 minutes had downloaded some WMA files, transfered a cd to my computer, then to the Mpio. And, they ALL play. Well worth the extra money I spent."
5,incredible,This is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the revolution and the reasons for it. Exquisite translation of the speeches of the most singificant man in centuries!
4,Please read before bombing.,"It is exactly as advertised - a decent, thorough collection of works by arguably the most important revolutionary thinker of the contemporary era. Could do without the tiresome laudatory epic introduction, but it comes with the territory, evidently."
2,episodes have REALLY SHORT time.,"WOW I use to turn on the tv station for my girls to watch this show. It was then a 30 min show. The shows on this DVD are at best, 2 mins long. Yes, TWO minutes long. My girls just get into the story when the beginning and ending music plays. Wasnt what I was expecting at all. Not the way TV broadcasted at all.... Thought you might need to know."
3,"Robin Crow, 2nd Nature","Robin Crow's ""2nd Nature"" is rather average for this artist. ""Creator"" and ""Quiet Before the Storm"" are quite decent recordings. ""Irresistible Flame"" was a dim flame compared to other Robin Crow projects."
2,Guys don't buy this book,"Guys,If you are looking for answers to why your girl friend goes nuts 1 week out of the month, this is not the book for you. Actually if you take the author advice and disappear that week, then maybe this book is for you. Other wise, it does not give any more insight into a woman cycle other than;1. She crabby.2. She want to clean things.3. She wants to [have sex].And before you women start in on the male bashing. Let me first say. WE ARE MEN. WE WANT TO FIT THINGS. Hence the reason for my purchase of this book. I saw my girlfried in pain and I wanted to help. But according to this book, it's best to let you women PMS yourself silly and hold on tight till it's over. You know what? From what I have experience I'll be joining a monastery in the morning. AAAhhhhh to be in the company of sane men.Luck to all you men."
2,Cheaply made blanket,"I ordered this blanket because I loved the red gingham, and it went well with our nursery theme. I wanted a medium-weight cotton blanket for our new baby (baby #3). I was incredibly disappointed when it arrived. The red is more of an orange-red instead of the rich red depicted in the picture. Even worse is that the blanket is cheaply made. When I pulled it out of the package, it already had threads hanging off, loose threads and snapped threads. Instead of a blanket that felt soft, cozy and snuggle-worthy, the fabric felt cheap. Think 1980s polyester. Needless to say, I'm still searching for the perfect cotton crib blanket for our little guy."
2,bad quality,"It looked beautiful at the picture. But use it two weeks, It have little ball all over surface. bad quality"
4,Soft blanket or floor blanket,"This is a nice fairly soft blanket, it's not as fluffy as I expected it to be based on the picture, but it works great for a floor mat. The color is a vibrant red and it is well sewn."
2,Thinner than it looks,"This coverlet was extremely thin. After comparing it with some others from Pottery Barn, we chose to spend the extra money and go with the higher quality product that will definitely last longer."
3,"Useful, but cheaply made","This is a sturdy cotton blanket good for floor play with an infant. The stitching quickly came loose in some areas and at has yet to soften up. So it's useful, but I wouldn't buy one as a gift."
4,More great REK,"""Gravitational Forces"" is as comfortable as your favorite shirt. REK slips in and out of each track with customary ease. The tracks that stand out to me the most so far are ""Hello New Orleans"" and ""Not a Drop of Rain"", but each has distict REK qualities. All but the title track deal with ne'er-do-wells, outlaws, has-beens, and never-weres. The title track is a spoken-word gem about sound-checks and space!! For old-time Keen fans, there is a Terry Allen song and a remake of ""The Road Goes On Forever."" All in all, the album is so laid back, it's horizontal! Well worth it."
4,best since gringo honeymoon,"yes, keen's arista nashville albums were bad. but this is a great return to form. ""walkin' cane"" is a classic southern-rock slide-guitar anthem. ""my home ain't in the hall of fame"" is a wonderful, self-deprecating ditty that shows the humor keen himself no longer allows himself to write. ""goin' nowhere blues"" is a great dylanesque number. in fact, every song on here is at least very good and many are excellent. i'll admit that i gave up on keen once he decided he needed to be a ""serious songwriter"" and got so pathetically boring. so maybe i'm overrating this one. but i got a promo back in march and then i finally got a real version this week (early october), so i've spent some time with it. and i like it even more than i did six months ago. and there's certainly no need to complain about ""the road goes on forever,"" which plays more like a hidden bonus track than like he's trying to pass it off as new material. it's awesome."
4,a pleasure from beginning to end,"I haven't listened to a Robert Earl Keen CD since his first on Sugar Hill (when he was Robert Earl Keen, Jr.), but on a hunch I ordered his debut on Lost Highway. I'm glad I did. In its modest way it's a gem. Like other respected country and folk artists, Keen does not have a technically good voice, but he uses what he has to warm and telling effect. He also has a good ear for songs, not filling the CD with originals whether they're worthy of inclusion or not, but having the good sense to draw on other writers when he finds songs that work for him. I love his inspired reading of the traditional ""Walkin' Cane."" Another treat is Townes Van Zandt's ""Snowin' on Raton,"" which puts the lie to the cliche that the only good Van Zandt compositions are his early ones. Joe Dolce's ""My Home Ain't in the Hall of Fame"" is the perfect opening cut. The originals are just as good. All in all, an enjoyable recording, and a welcome escape from the horrors of this moment in America."
1,"Worst CD ever, until Farm Fresh Onions came out","This is one of REK's worst CD's. As a big REK fan I think I can tell his good stuff from his bad stuff. The only CD he has made worse than this one is his new one, FARM FRESS ONIONS."
4,Texas Aggie,"This CD is a little different than the past releases from REK but still just as good. The band has a great following and that is seen very clearly in ""AGGIELAND"". If you made the mistake of reading one of the above reviews that talked down about this CD take a long look at the fact the individual who reviewed it does'nt like country. Robert Earl Keen is a Texan, an Aggie, and a Southerner. If that does'nt interest you do not waist your time listening to the music that way I do not have to waist my time reading your review, If you do not like this music turn on MTV and watch TRL and I am sure it will be right up your alley. For everyone else this is good ""Americana"" music for good Americans. That is just one Aggies opinion. ""WHOOP"""
2,Bland and uninspired,"Unfortunately the downward trend begun with ""Picnic"" and continued with ""Walking Distance"" continues with this CD. Definitely REK's worst effort to date."
3,Spoiled,"REK - you've spoiled us. You put out those first 5-6 albums where every song is killer. Just put it on random and listen all day. Now with these last two you give 3-4 cuts that are the best yet, by far (Feelin' Good Again, Hall of Fame, Wild Wind, Not A Drop, Down That Dusty Road) but start pluggin' in the filler for the other cuts. I guess that's to be expected - can't be absolutely brilliant each and every cut. Problem is - you used to be. I'll still buy everything you ever do and see you live every place you go ('ceptin Billy Bob's fight club) but the total package has gone downhill. And I'm not one of those Road Goes On, Merry Christmas, Copenhagen, Pissin' In The Wind guys, either.By the way, Roger Craeger is doin' a hell of an imitation of you on his latest CD. Everclear and Fun All Wrong shoulda been yours."
3,Not This One,"I was introduced to REK's music by a friend about two years ago and have been an avid fan every since. Needless to say I now own every REK CD and have been fortunate enough to attend five of his concerts over the past two years.I have listened to this CD numerous times and have literally tried to force myself to like the music as I am such a big REK fan but this one is a little hard to swallow. There are a couple of great tracks on the CD but in my opinion collectively this is his worst effort since No Kinda Dancer. With this being the case I hope we don't have to wait another three years to listen to REK's next effort which I am sure will be much, much better.Revised 27-Oct-01: I have to say, as I take my foot out of my mouth, that the more I listen to this CD the more I am beginning to really enjoy it. It took a little while for the music to win me over but I will have to say that tracks 2-9 are as good as anything REK has put out in a while."
5,The whiners don't get it.,"With a few negative reviews, you'd get the sense that this disc was somehow different than all of REK's other classics. It's not. This beauty is one of his strongest releases yet. People get bent out of shape 'cause one song has a ""spacey' feel to it. Get over it; the tunes about one minute long, and he was just having some fun with it. I can't get over how fickle people get. My only complaint with this one is that I don't care for another version of ""The Road Goes on Forever"". It's been done to death, but that doesn't even come close to putting a negative spin on this great Texas album."
2,How many dumb CTs can I get to buy this album.,"Folks really what was he thinking here. ""I have been doing this over 10 years. Drunk Corps Turds scream and yell when I play my stuff, maybe I will turn out a half worthless album and they will buy it like hot cakes."" CT's if you haven't bought it don't bother. It is not REK it is REK laughing at you. Like everyone says Hello New Orleans and Snowin on Raton are great but that's about it. Grow up and Listen to Lyle Lovett"
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"I am very new to listening to REK, and having heard West Textures and the Live Dinner 2 album, I'm surprised at how starkly different Gravitational Forces is. I am not generally a fan of ""country"" music, but found the vocals, guitar, and lyrics of the earlier productions alluring. Compared to these, Gravitational Forces sounded like a commercial country album. But maybe that's how he wants it?"
2,The magic is gone,"Everyone knows that if you want to play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band. Robert Earl got rid of his, so his band sounds suddenly typical, boring, and unexciting. The ""band"" has shrunk, and so have Robert Earl's creative juices (why so many covers on this CD?)... strange for a guy whose strength has always been to tell a great story or give life to characters we grew to love so much.I am enjoying a few tunes, but like Lucinda's CD earlier this year, what could have been great is merely ""okay""."
3,A Karajan success,"OK! So everybody loves it, and with some reason. I will not bother giving details on why it is rather great, but I will tell you why I only give 3 stars: it has Pavarotti in it. Perhaps I am a little bit prejudiced since I do not like the man. Perfect singing, but shallow singing and that becomes boring with time. I must admit that considering the other beauties of this recording I do not know who else could have sung that day that would have fit well. Domingo, for all its greatness would have been too strong a leading man. Kraus too weak. Carreras? Ah! If Alagna had been born two decades earlier! I would have given 6 stars! Meanwhile, as I wait for the perfect Boheme which will come now without Pavarotti and unfortunately without Freni since both do not have anymore that juvenile bloom in their voice, I listen to this version with pleasure. After all I must admit that Pavarotti is less irritating here than in other places works."
5,The definitive recording all should have.,"This is the perfect recording of La Boheme because it captured the best singers in their prime. What is a better combination than Mirella Freni and Luciano Pavarotti? Even the other singers are tops-Rolando Panerai, Elizabeth Harwood and of course, Nicolai Ghiaurov (Freni's husband). The conducting of Von Karajan never dsipleases. This may not be a DDD recording, but the remastering is excellent. I would never replace this recording in the world. A must for all operatic libraries!"
2,Should have spent a little more.,Wish I would have paid more attention and seen that it has screw extenders instead of the clip kind. Takes to long to set up. Spend an extra 50 bucks and save yourself alot of time.
5,Manfrotto 190XDB Tripod,I bought this tripod for a photography class I'm taking. Turns out the tripod is a prosumer product used by both advanced photographers and intermediate. It appears to be constructed well and supports my digital camera just fine. I got a great deal purchasing from Amazon and would recommend this tripod to anyone looking for a solid set of legs and support for their camera at a great price.
2,You can do better,"I had this tripod for about 6 months when the connection between the head and the center column started getting ""loosey goosey."" This is really not an ok thing for a tripod!I liked it when I got it, thought it was a reasonable value, and used it quite a bit. I decided to shop around and look for something better rather than fighting over whether the degradation of stability was a warranty issue -- I'd rather learn my lesson and get what I really wanted/needed to begin with.Feature list for this tripod and overall construction seem about average for the price.Longevity obviously was a problem.I believe that Manfrotto has put its name on a product that really doesn't deserve it.Bottom line -- you can do better. Take a look at the Slik line. The 700 is a little less expensive and blows this tripod away."
4,Solid,"Excellent, very stable tripod. Now I realize how worthless the throw-away tripod is that they gave me when I bought my camera. This Manfrotto is not particularly light, but that's to be expected in a good tripod. Wish it had come with some way to carry it, though. I recently ordered the Manfrotto shoulder strap to carry it with, but it hasn't arrived yet."
4,Manfrotto 501,Muy bueno. Justo lo que esperaba y necesitaba.Lo uso con una Sony VX2100 y es lo que necesitaba.
4,A Great Perspective of a Great Band,"I've heard the string quartet tribute to tool, and I've heard this tribute (along with the Tool versions) and in my opinion out of the two tribute cd's this one is the best. It's defiantly different, but it's incredibly beautiful and creative how they have combined exotic instruments and drums with classic string orchestra qualities. I personally don't like the version of schism but the other songs are incredibly well done. This cd will bring you on an emotional trip of Tools well written music. This is a must buy for both tool and non tool fans."
2,not what i expected,"A little quirky for an avid tool fan...can compare to the string quartet album but not as good. You cant portray the feeling and message of TooL through this type of music. Peace, TIM"
2,Good selection but a lot of hiss,"The track selection is nice but the CD has a significant level of background hiss. The louder you play, the more audible the hiss, so volume doesn't help."
3,verbose,"Author wrote ""a large number of actions,"" when he could have written ""many actions."" He did this more than once."
4,"Scintillating Sixth, So-So Second","Due to the way record companies pair up the Sibelius symphonies, I found myself with good performances of all but the Sixth, so I took a chance on this budget buy from Sony. As far as that symphony, Maazel does an excellent, if unexpected, job. At first I found his approach a little more jagged than I was used to, but after a couple of listenings, I couldn't get enough of it. The Second is another story: Maazel starts off slow, and then rises to a kind of highly controlled adequacy, but not much more. This is a pity considering the mystical heights this can exhibit in the right hands. The orchestra plays well, and the recording job is first rate, so this disc is worth it for the Sixth."
3,Maazel at his most indifferent,"Lorin Maazel has had two gos as conductor of the Pittsburgh Symn., and one gets the idea that the second time around was pretty dismal. Certainly this is a dispirited (and dispiriting) Sym. #2 -- loggy, lacking in rhythmic bite, and noncommittal where it needs to be epic and heroic. I wonder why Maazel bothers to conduct works in which he basically sits on the sidelines and watches the scenery go by? The reviewer above is more impressed by the Sym. #6 rreading, but it seems cut form the same cloth to me -- at best it's pleasant and breezy. In all, this isn't a CD any lover of Sibelian should bohter with. If you must have Maazel's Sibelius, go for his early set on Decca with the Vienna Phil."
2,Disappointing,The packet consists of mainly comprehension questions for each chapter. Not muc creative thought went into the production of this guide.
1,Doesn't do them justice.,"Well, before I say anything about this tribute album, let me state clearly for the record that I am a HUGE Muse fan, and always will be. I'm also very fond of classical music, so I thought this album would be incredible. Unfortunately, that assumption was way off. To me, this was basically like a bunch of recordings of people humming Muse songs. The original tracks have so much power and emotion, but these versions seem cheap and empty. If they would have had a full orchistra it would have been awesome. The string quartet just doesn't cut it, at least not for me. Of course, this is all in my humble opinion."
2,"They gave it a try, sort of. (2.5 stars)","While I realize that these string quartet tribute albums are churned out at a ridiculous clip by studio musicians, I can tell they put a little more thought into this one.Overall, the track choices are good. There are the big hits: Newborn, Time is Running Out, etc., but there's also a great b-side, Map of Your Head. But the bottom line is really ""Is this worth my money?""Well, probably not. It's a neat listen if you are a Muse completist (I am) but even for me, it's not really worth more than a listen or two. The goal of these string quartet tributes is to really bring out the beauty of the compositions of these otherwise heavy songs, but it seems to me that for say, Stockholm Syndrome, the original has more depth and poigniancy to it anyway.I do give them credit for the original composition, ""Saving Grace"", it really sounds like it could be a muse song, in a good way."
2,Review from a classical musician,"I play cello in a string quartet and am a huge Muse fan as well. As far as this compilation of, perhaps, some of Muse's greatest hits, a string quartet version just doesn't depict the kind of emotional response that I get from listening to the orignal trio. I listened to some of these tracks and thought I was listening to my buddies playing Muse songs by ear and just messing around. Save your money, or better yet, for the same price go out and treat yourself to the original albums that these songs derived from (Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and Absolution)!"
3,"Good, but not for the casual fan","I agree very much with Brian Allen; you should only spend the money on this one if you happen to be either a big fan or strings or a big fan of Muse, and I fall very much into the latter. As far as the songs themselves, some sound beautiful. ""Bliss"" nearly breaks your heart as an all-string tribute. But other songs are hard-core alternative rock, like ""Stockholm Syndrome"" so songs like that sound awkward at best. If you like a song by Muse here and there, only have one or two of their CDs, and think, ""Oh, they're alright,"" don't bother purchasing it. However for big Muse fans, it's a nice treat."
4,"Good, but not great","I'll do an actual review later, but here are some of my thoughts on this album, since only one other person rated it so far. The songs all sound great, but they hardly differ from the original versions, and none of them are really that much different. Most of them sound note for note the same, but just played on the strings. This is ok because Muse has a lot of classical influence in their songs, but I wish the makers would have put more effort into this. If you're a casual fan you can skip, but if you really like string tributes or Muse you should get it. Some better string tributes, which are less basic, are the ones for Nine Inch Nails, Coldplay, and A Perfect Circle."
4,"Stereolab fans, take note","Another spin-off from Stereolab, with less in common with its source than Laeticia's side-project Monade (Which is also worth a listen, particularly ""A Few Steps More""). This one is from their bassist, Simon Johns, and draws a bit from Stereolab's hypnotic riffing style, but new vocalist Mary Hampton has a cleaner, lighter soprano voice...and I'd say this stands on its own merits. Fans of Adventures in Stereo might find it familiar territory, though the song structures are generally more complex and elaborated upon. Recommended. ""Trinity Neon"", their initial effort, isn't as strong, a band finding its footing; Half of its tracks are instrumentals, and as with Monade, not up to its sophomore effort. Those who love ""Blow It Up"" and Stereolab completists may want to check it out."
5,Buy it -- your children will love it!,"My 8-year-old twins love this book. It's one of those books that they want read to them 3-4 nights a week. The cadence of the language makes this book a perfect bed-time book. And, they love the illustrations. Try it. Your children will love it and will add it to that stack of books that they read over and over again."
4,Promising product,"As a product, it seems promising. I've been taking it for 2 mos. now. I did a bit of research on skin care vitamins. I especially liked that it had Vits. A & E and L-lysine, all commonly known to promote skin health. Many other products seem like regular multivitamins. I also spoke w/ a rep. from the company before purchasing to confirm it was gluten free. She said it'd take between 2 & 5 mos. to see results and sent me skin health material by mail. Combined w/ better skin care, my skin is getting better."
4,Acne,I've used this product in the past and know that it does help with my skin (mainly acne). I am taking it again since I've have been breaking out due to hormonal issues. It hasn't fully 'kicked in' yet - but from past usage - I know that it does work.
5,Excellent product....just give it time :-),"This is an excellent and natural way to tackle acne. I've used it successfully before, the key thing is to use it consistently and to start at the appropriate dose for you. If your acne is severe, start with 6 pills a day (fun I know). If it's moderate start with for pills a day. Since it's natural it does take a while to see results. It ranges from 2-8 months for people. After your skin clears up, keep at your dose for at least 2 months after that you can gradually decrease it, so if you've been taking 6 a day, take 4, if you've been taking 4, take 2. Over time once your acne troubles are over, you can decrease it to the maintenance level which is just 2 easy pills a day! If you do have severe acne I'd recommend the 200 tablet bottle as that will last you a month, anything less than that will only last you 2 weeks. Great product!"
4,Great headlamp,I've had this lamp for a few years now and think it's the greatest thing. It's bright and the batteries last for a long time. I'm in the Navy and it's great for working on our aircraft at night when we have light restrictions. The Green light is even Night Vision Goggle compatible. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the on/off button fell off a few weeks ago.
4,the old metal guitar,this album make me come back to the 80's l.a. metal booms. so old so worth to memorize the 80's metal guitar heros.
1,All wrong,"The Track List as shown by Amazon is incorrect:Track Listings1. Sweating Bullets (Anxiety Edit)2. Symphony of Destruction [Live]3. Countdown to Extinction [Live]4. Symphony of Destruction (The Gristle Edit Mix) - Megadeth, Trent ReznorWhat is actually on the disc?Track Listings1. Sweating Bullets2. Sweating Bullets (Live - Dave Mustaine)3. Ashes In Your Mouth (Live)4. Countdown To Extinction (Live)What disappoints me most is the ""live"" versions. If you listen to the ""crowd"" it sounds artificial. Totally fake. The songs don't sound that great live anyway. Big let down here.The track I wanted most was the Gristle Edit mix of Symphony of Destruction. I think its on theSymphony of DestructionCD Single - not this one."
1,TRICLOSAN IS NOT SAFE...LIARS!!!!!!!!!!,"Only got a star b/c i had to, I would give this zero stars. I cannot believe it is not illegal to sell this product.Please do not buy antibacterial items with the active ingredient listed as Triclosan. Products such as this lead to more and more antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, MRSA for example. Please, for the health of yourself and your family...DO NOT BUY! The problem is, we treat people with Trichlosan for a bacterial infection. If you go rubbing it on your body all the time, guess what, when you get sick your little bacteria buddies have developed a tolerance to it and will not die when you take the drug. Just use regular soap and as hot as you can stand water and you will be fine. In a hurry alcohol based products are fine to use because we don't treat bacterial infections with alcohol."
2,"This Sure Ain't ""Buried In Oblivion""","The new edition (vocalist Stu Block) has killed the perfect vocal line-up w/ his ridiculous, overkilled ""80's power metal"" screams. It just doesn't fit & it ruins the few songs w/ potential on this release, which is a far cry from the last one anyway. There's nowhere near as much melody in the music & pitifully few vocal harmonies, further widening the gap from Oblivion. I keep listening ... hoping it'll grow on me & I'll somehow eventually get past the new festering puss-sore, nails-on-a-chalkboard style vocals, but it just ain't hap'nin.Fortunately for the band tho, it would seem I'm the odd man out b/c all these other reviews seem to be raving. I sincerely hope no one else is as disappointed as I am. These guys have so much more talent & ability than comes thru on this cd. Better luck next time fellas."
2,Irresistible Flame,"Irresistible Flame is a dim flamed sleeper. Only buy this if you are a die hard Robin Crow fan. ""Creator"" and ""Quiet Before the Storm"" Are the better recordings."
3,This set is identical to the Oneida Set for $12 at walmart..........,"Ok just as my title said... This is the identical set for $12 under the Oneida line. So basically $24 for this set is to expensive... Goto walmart and save your money.Ok as to the set itself, its ok in quality.. Not bad but not going to WOW anyone... So For $12, its a good value.. At $24.95 I would say no...I hope this was helpful."
5,Great for the TREO 650,This item is great for the TREO 650. It is pre-cut just right to fit to your screen. Great for the person who wants to protect their investment.
5,The best of the best,"Iomega has been known for its reliable products for a long time. I didn't believe it until I tried it today. I just ordered a 100 ATAPI internal zip drive and installed it in a matter of seconds. It didn't take me more than 5 minutes to slide the drive into one of the 3 1/2 bays, connect the power socket and the interface, and bam it's up and running with no problems. I didn't think it could be that easy. The product comes with an interface card, 2 power supply sockets and 4 screws. I didn't need anything other than 1 screw and that's it. I highly recommended."
1,"This Company is the WORST one I've ever bought from,Lies, Lies, Lies thats all you'll get.","Don't buy or trust anything they say, they called and sent e-mails sayingthey were going to send a RMA and Label for weeks and nothing but lies."
5,Perfect for the average fisherman,I'm just a week-end fisherman. I had a smaller Plano box which did well when I went out a couple of times a year. I now go almost every week-end and I do more than a hook and worm. This box is perfect for anyone who fishes like I do. Just above a hook and worm. I experiment with artificial baits now and this does the trick. Not to big not too small. I recommend this HIGHLY. Sincerely Michael S. Owen....
4,craft organizer,"My son works with leather and need something to organize his supplies. This was perfect, alot of compartments and drawers, every thing easy acsess. And it arrived quickly."
3,Be careful!,"I've got this video for my 5 year old son. The video is not bad but it will be a ""one-timer"". It's 23 minutes long and has 3 stories, 3 songs and couple of very simple games (for 3 year olds). The reviews of other related ""bedbug"" stories take up almost as much time as the the show itself. The stories lack depth. It's ok for 3 or 4 year old Jewish kids but not for 8 year olds (it says on the disc ""for kids 3-8""). So be careful if you buying the disc for someone older. This is a good material for Christians, who want to educate their children about Passover. However, I would not recommend this for Jewish parents. It's worth watching it once or twice but it's a waste to buy it for the home collection. So if your library has it, don't spend money here."
5,"Thoughtful, Delicate New Age Ambient Album","Bernard Xolotl is a very interesting New Age composer. His 8 CDs, which I collected, are very subtle, sweet and 'outer space' compositions. They slowly enthrall the listener in a delicate web of intricate little sounds, to simply make him/her feel better from the inside. I believe Xolotl is underrated and that he deserves a larger audience. Some of his albums are available on iTunes. Happy Space Travels!"
5,A good book for those wishing to learn more about the IBM PC,"This book is good for those wishing to learn about the inner workings of the IBM PC and 8086 Assembly Language, requires a familirarity with BASIC or some other programming language and the PC, Microsoft Macro Assembler version 1.0 or later or compatible assembler recommended"
1,More reviews are needed on this item.......,"This particular item is not up to my standards. The paddles do not fit flush together so you have to use your second hand to pinch the paddles together so that your hair does not slide out. In doing so, you cannot hold on to the length of hair that you are trying to guide through the paddles. PLUS, this snags or better yet, does not glide through hair, which makes it impossible to have sleek, smooth hair. I have used it three times on (just blown) DRY hair. I did not try it on damp hair as it says can be done. I am going back to my ""old faithful"" iron. It is not ceramic, but it is easier to work with. I don't know if this particular iron is simply one that ""slid through"" inspection before hitting the market, but I cannot recommend it."
3,I think it works.,"I used this product a while ago. It is definitely messy and you worry about your lungs it you don't apply it correctly. I believe it did handle the problem. But I am sure there are probably less messy deterrents on the market. You get a lot of it for what you pay, so it is a good purchase."
4,Diatomaceous Earth for killing fleas,"We have used this on our pets, in their bedding, on our carpets and couches. It is a little messy/dusty, but it does appear to be cutting down on the number of fleas on the pets and in the house. Plus it's safe for the crawling baby boy that lives with us! I'd recommend this over foggers and chemicals any day!"
