3,Not what I wanted,This book provides good background information but was not the reference material I had hoped for. I ended up buying a couple more books to provide what I wanted
5,"If you like chocolate, you will LOVE these","I love these bars. Full of Protein and very chocolately! If you LOVE chocolate, you will LOVE these bars; very tasty!"
5,Very good item!,Very good price and it works as same as $350 ones!it is not looking great and fancy but who cares is only $40.Although the plastic bags are not good!they are very thin and not strong.
4,Good Product,"Extremely fast shipping, easy to use once you're done tinkering to find the right setting"
1,STILL NOT HERE!!!!!!!!,"I ordered this sealer to enhance a small home packaging business one month ago, and I am still awaiting its arrival... Can amazon please make some inquiries for me ASAP!!!!! This is the first time that I have bought anything from a source outside of AMAZON and believe me...... its the last.I am very disappointed!!!Jenelle"
3,satisfied customer,The product was shipped promptly and arrived on time. It is exactly what I expected and the dealer was courteous and I would do business again with them.
5,So far so good,"We've been using it to seal 2mm clear plastic bags and 16oz foil coffee bags (2 different settings). We've been consistently using it on a daily basis. Its very fast and it seals tight. Overall, it's been working great."
2,Needs the tapes,"This entire book is designed to be used with tapes that are not included. In order to buy the tapes you must purchase them with the book again. The book and tape set came highly recommended. But all of the excercises, all of the dialogs, and all of the pronunciation must be derived from the tapes. I believe that it is criminal misrepresentation on the part of the publisher to sell this book separately. You have been warned!"
5,daughter in law requsted and was correct,gave as a gift and was exactly what was ordered. Was on daughter in law wish list and was what she wanted.
3,size difference,"Maybe it's my fault for not knowing how much smaller 1:87 would be but I was expecting something...bigger. I bought this for my husband, he already has a model from 1992 but his favorite year of trans am/firebirds is 2002, I was thinking that this model would be the same size as the one he already has. No, the car itself is about an inch long, it looks like it could have come out of a 25 cent machine or with a happy meal. I also don't like the fact that it says ""model power minis"" all over it. I get the fact that this was made from that company but putting it on the box 3 times and on the product once is a bit overstated.The car is bolted down to the base of the display box. So the fact that the wheels spin and the detail on them becomes irrelevant. Not to mention, the car says Trans am on it, but the display says firebird. Though there are only slight differences between the two cars, an inconsistency such as this shouldn't be present in a model of it."
2,Classic Look but Not a Timeless Construction,"I have been searching for a classic stainless steel bottle opener that did not have any plastic in it's construction to replace the tchotchke openers that I've collected over time. I realize this item is only five bucks, but am unimpressed with the cheap stamped steel construction. The metal is pitted, and the finish on the tip of the opener chipped off almost immediately. This is a kitchen tool that is supposed to remove metal bottle caps and open metal cans. You would assume the metal that the tool is made of will be more durable then the metal bottle caps it is removing.If you looking for a kitchen tool rather then just a cheap opener I suggest you keep looking."
3,Sturdy,"This is a perfect bottle opener for me.However, I should note that it isn't the most elegant piece. In fact there are edges that aren't quite ground down. A person with delicate skin may have trouble with that.Also, there were two large stickers on the opener. After I peeled them off I had to scrub it with rubbing alcohol to remove all the glue. It probably took me 1/2 hour to do this which is ridiculous.But once that was done I'm left with a thick steel bottle opener which is what I wanted. If you like your kitchen tools to be strong enough to hack through 1/4 inch of cement then this one may be for you too."
4,great jeans,"I like these jeans, they do run a size larger than the size states, not sure what the reason is for this. Always liked the fit of wrangler jeans vs levis. Little expensive, never seem to be on sale, maybe a couple dollars off that's all. Haven't had them long enough to comment on the wear, etc."
5,Sizing is so huge!,"Along with the previous reviewers, I think these jeans are very comfortable and nice looking, and recommend them highly. I did order one size smaller than my usual, due to the previous reviews, but even so, they're a little big. The thing I didn't realize and wanted to make future buyers aware of, is that the length is also oversized. For all other pants I own, I wear a regular length, so that is what I ordered. They are beyond dragging on the floor, so apparently petite length would have been ample -- but I like them well enough that I will have them shortened. They really are nice jeans but I wish the sizing were more typical."
4,Love these jeans,"I finally found a pair of jeans to fit this overweight, 51 yr old body of mine. The jeans fit perfectly. No gaps in the back waist, no extra material hanging from the backs of the thighs (under the seat), and just enough stretch. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that I ordered my regular size (not one size smaller as Wrangler advised). Of course my regular size is a 16 in comfort waist, stretch LLBean jeans, so... Thank you women of Wrangler!"
4,wrangler aura jeans,"The jeans are sized different. I had to order 2 sizes smaller than normal. I like the way that they fit. I do not like that they stretch out. After wearing for a day, I have to wash them to reshrink them."
4,Lycra Spandex vs Spandex,"I have been wearing these Aura jeans for several years now and love them...Best fitting jeans I have ever had... I was a little disappointed when I received these jeans,because even though they were the same serial number as the previous store bought pairs that I have been wearing,they did not fit exactly the same... The only difference that I could find is that the store bought pairs tag was made with Lycra Spandex and the Amazon bought pairs were made with Spandex...That said the new pairs from Amazon did not seem to have the same elasticity to them and therefore, did not conform the same way... Everything else I am happy with and will get great wear out of them..."
1,Does not smell like vanilla at all,This item does not smell like vanilla at all. It just smells like generic incense burning. Wasted my money on this purchase :-(
4,A Solid Dance CD,"From Lucrezia's enjoyable opening cut ""Looking 4 Love"" to Gloria Gaynor concluding ""Last Night"" the CD offers 72 minutes of seamless dance music. Included are fine efforts such as Taylor Dayne's ""Planet Love"" and Joi Cardwell's Superstar"". It is, however Trish Vogel's amazing cover of ""Ooh Child"" that is the standout cut and makes this disc worth owning. Put this disc on your CD player and party on."
4,innocence lost,"Ginny is the central character this story is written around - an innocent girl raised in the Dutch East Indies, and educated in a convent - whose life is thrown into termoil when she finds she is part of a famous english family which owns and operates a historically famous 'fine English Bone-china' company. Ginny becomes wrapped up in the family history and intrigue...why did her father run away and hide ?, what happend to aunt Isobelle ?, Does she really want to become responsible for this huge organization and everyone's future ? and what about Mark - the wild and romantic young new artist who is tied up in both the china and Ginny's ( mostly fantasy ) love life ?? This book is part romance novel, and part historical fiction. I thought it was well written, and great fun - it kept me interested right to the end. Along the lines of ""Woman of Substance"" Highly recommended diversion. Rex"
1,Secret Life Indeed,"This is a secret life Audrey Hepburn led only in the author's deluded mind. I bought the book because I was curious. After a few pages, I wished that, further than reading the back cover blurb, I had flipped through the book to glean some of the choice accusations, then I wouldn't have wasted the money. As another reviewer puts it, I too can't believe the audacity of the publisher to have endorsed such garbage.Of course it's not outside the realm of possibility that a young, then unknown actress might have had an unwanted pregnancy... but the author is clearly quite insane when he claims to be a victim of unsuccessful attempts of assasination commissioned by his 'mother' not to mention the possibility of his being the result of possible Nazi experiments performed on Hepburn with her knowledge.Stuart Byscynki needs professional help and he should get it quick!"
1,This book is all lies,"This book is completely full of lies. DO NOT BELIEVE THE AUTHOR! Being a huge Audrey fan, and having read many books on her, I would recommend ""Audrey - Her Real Story"" by Alexander Walker. It is most enjoyable and accurate."
1,Lies! All lies! This is not a good book to read.,"This book or piece of trash, to put it lightly, is extremelydemeaning to Audrey Hepburn. Anyone who possesses any sort ofadmiration for this very talented, very beautiful, very benevolent woman should know that the facts in this book are a great deal contradictory to all the knowledge we have of her. Audrey had many miscarriages and was completely devastated each time. She loved her children very much. In fact, she was kind and generous to everyone. I think that this Stuart Byczynski, whoever he may be, ia a liar and has entirely too much time on his hands. He probably has a severe oedipus complex and only wishes Audrey was his mother out of lust. At any rate, I do not reccomend this book. It is full of painful lies and all Audrey fans just might decide to find the sick man and put him out of his misery."
4,from the book cover,"In 1739 Jonathan Edwards preached a series of thirty sermons in his church at Northampton, Massachusetts-sermons based on one scriptural passage, Isaiah 51:8. Apparently he later intended to develop this discourse into a major treatise construing God's redemption of the world as the most basic doctrine of theology. Unfortunately, he died before he could undertake this project. The sermon series, however, was later transcribed and then published in Edinburgh in 1774. There were numerous editions in Britain and the United States, and it was enormously influential in popular evangelical circles of the nineteenth century. This edition presents a modern, authoritative text that firmly established the place of Work of Redemption in the literary and historical tradition of puritan New England"
2,"not what I expected,",the book is not what I expected. I had expected something on the orderof previously tried designs and technical info. I would have appreciateda couple of pages as a preview.
4,Leave a Message for Willie,"""Leave a Message for Willie"" is the fifth novel in the Sharon McCone series by Marcia Muller. Willie Whelan is a vendor, who is also a fence, at the Saltflats Flea Market. He hires McCone to check on a man wearing a yarmulke who has been hanging around Willie's stall. The man, Jerry Levin, claims he is working for a group that recovers stolen Torahs. Later that day Levin is found dead in Whelan's garage. Willie becomes the major suspect in this murder, and Sharon McCone must find the real killer. All the Sharon McCone mysteries are well-plotted, and the characters, especially McCone, make them a pleasure to read. ""Leave a Message for Willie"" is a very good novel."
4,Danger in a flea market,"Investigator Sharon McCone has been asked to do an assignment in which she'll work with Willie Whelan, a man who sells goods at flea markets. Willie is concerned because a man is stalking him and he wants Sharon to find out why. As she begins the investigation, the stalker is killed and Willie is the chief suspect. Sharon begins to uncover some strange occurrences in connection with the murdered man, and before it's all over her own life is put in jeopardy. This is a good mystery which Marcia Muller fans will want to read and it has some romance thrown in for good measure."
4,Solid entry in the Sharon McCone series,"Sharon McCone has a difficult assignment. Why is a man in a suit and a yarmulke following Willie - flea market entrepanuer extradinaire? What unfolds is a short (152 pages) but tightly woven tale of torahs, player pianos, Vietnam PTSD, cabins in the Santa Cruz mountains and Sharon's ability to see the connections. It's a solid (not stellar) book in the series. As a native of the Bay Area, I enjoy her musings about the locale as much as the story and she goes some pretty interesting places in this episode. Also, Don the DJ from Games to Keep the Dark Away is back so we have a little romance for Sharon."
2,Muller too early,"Probably the least enjoyable Muller book I've read so far. This shows her early difficulties with character development and plot excitement. Her more recent novels have a lot more to offer the picky mystery reader. (McCone's life gets a lot more exciting as she ages!!!!)Mixing up the torah business with the Santa Cruz mountains and PTSD and the flea market just somehow didn't work for me. Usually I enjoy Muller's ramblings around Northern California; however, the wandering just didn't work for me here.Also, wondering why so many reviewers on Amazon.com feel it necessary to do a plot summary and possibly spoil key plot developments? A review ought to be our opinions, right, not giving away most of the story before we even open the book!"
2,what happened to the selling?,"I subtracted one star because the author heavily favors drawing with pencil and paper and then scanning the image into the computer and going digital from there. You can scan the Mona Lisa into the computer, that doesn't make Da Vinci a digital artist. I felt it also gave short shrift to vector based art, as a result of the paper & pencil origins.From four stars, I cut the rating in half, because there is only half a book here. If it had been called ""How to Draw Digital Cartoons"" I would have left it at four stars, but the title says ""and Sell"" so I expected something about selling. In fact, that's really what I was looking for in this book. There are only three pages about making money, and over 1 page of that is graphics. The bottom line, apparently, is that you won't make money with digital cartoons. Fine. But if that's the case, then the title is very misleading."
1,Last Man Standing...again?,"How the hell can they release two movies named ""Last Man Standing"" in the same year,especially when they have nothing else in common except that they are action movies(And that the one with Bruce Willis is better).Well anyway in this movie Jeff Wincott plays this cop whos being chased by both sides of the law and he actually gets stains in his suit(He wears the same kind of suit all the time in different coloours)."
3,Should be a tv show,"Sould be a tv show instead of a movie, not my cup of tea. But it would be ok if nothing else was on."
3,Well for free it was okay.,"So this movie is not terrible. The plus side is there is plenty of action and half naked women. The cons of this is the acting was borderline terrible, the shooting sequences were awful, the plot kinda stunk and there is so much glass broken they must have had stock in a glass company. I don't understand why someone would need to jump through plate glass when it would have been quicker to walk around. Also, they shoot until the gun clicks several times, then lay the gun down, um no. For crack marksmen they sure don't hit much with the seventeen billion rounds fired. Also, as a smoker who also works out 5 days a week, I can understand lighting up after ...whatever, but this guy is a frigging chimney holy cow! So if your bored, like lame cop movies with naked chicks, and can get it for free..then go ahead and waste your time."
1,Ridiculous.,The shootout in the Hyatt totally lost me before it was even through. Completely unrealistic ballistics... I won't waste another second watching this POS.
5,The Mind of the Maker,"Don't understand the question. I have my university degree in philosophy. This book by Sayers concerns her philosopy for the writer's approach to the act of literary creation as well the religious logic that she professes. This does not concern my opinion about the book. ""Mind of the Maker"" is a contemplative study of a creative endeavore.So far I am satisfied with this book. Thank you for asking. Purchased by Gwen Bohlen from Amazon.com"
4,Helpful analogy of the Trinity,"The doctrine of the Trinity may be the hardest doctrine for Christians to grasp. Sayers uses the creative process (Idea, Energy, Power) as an analogy for exploring the Trinity, Incarnation, free will versus sovereignty, etc. Her logic is generally well-thought, though her analogy is limited by the lack of a distinct personality of each part of the creative process. Still, this gem is a deeper exploration of God than most of us will hear elsewhere. Must reading for all."
3,fresh,"Sayers claims this is not her apology, and it is not, but she deals with many theological concepts in this work. Sayers wonderfully depicts the idea of the Trinity by comparing it to literature. The ideas are fresh, and profound, which makes the book tough to get through at times. The chapter on God being analogical is great and should be read by all. It perfectly captures the idea that God is truly unknowable until we die, which is why so many of us are on a quest to grow closer to him throughout our life."
3,could be better,my child cant seem to find the toy itself interesting-its just not very inviting to him-he does carry all the unattached pieces around to add to other toys tho-maybe he will like it more later on.It is cute and durable tho-just not exciting.
2,Sort of crap,"Less than one hour, this recent documentary has a few interviews with the little people such as fans and locals who recall the 1967 fiasco of Magical Mystery Tour, a Paul creation done in the immediate wake of Brian Epstein's death a month before. There is no actual Beatles music here, just muzak instrumentals of the soundtrack songs. There is a fair amount of cutting room stuff of the group on this fall 1967 jaunt around the south of England, but very little actual soundtrack material, aside from a couple of radio interviews done at the time. Spencer Davis and the guy from the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band reminisce a bit, as does Mike McCartney. Victor Spinetti narrates. Because of licensing, there is no footage or music from the rarely seen film itself, which makes this product of interest to Beatles completists only."
1,This album is his worst and not worth anyone's time,Don't waste your money on this. That is all you need to know
5,"A ""must read"" for students before starting on the wards.","I love this book. It first teaches the reader how to look at a chest x-ray in a simple, step-by-step approach. Then it is organized quite effectively into chapters based on the appearance of the x-ray (white lung field, widened mediastinum, etc.). A must read for medical students starting their rotations."
3,Not ambient. One track is worth it. The rest are okay,I like many of spacetime continuum's works I decided to buy emit ecaps. I listened to the whole CD few times. I found my self always skipping to String of Pearl and hitting repeat on that track. It ended up being the only one I listen to. SOP is ripe for remixing and has numerous interesting sound bits. Kairo is also good. I decided to buy remit recaps to see how better Kairo and SOP can be remixed. dissappointing. emit ecaps is not a good intro into ambient for those new to the genre. But it is ok to own it if you're a fanatic about collecting anything labeled 'ambient' I'd skip Remit Recaps completely as it is even father away from ambient than this album.
3,So so,"An alright album. A couple outsanding songs, but as a whole this just doesn't work. Quite boring."
5,LOVE them TENDER,"It was June 22, 1991....the day of my wedding. We knew they were coming...but when we walked into the reception place, it was too good to be true...Three acoustic guitars on stands, waiting for the magic to begin. We walked backstage to see them, elderly women in hot pants, identically coiffured, identical in many ways. The Del Rubios met us. This was a day like no other. We first danced to their rendition of Love Me Tender...My wife, in her bridal gown, jumped up and sang Nuetron Dance and walk like an egyptian. They sold t shirts in the lobby. It was a day of heaven.... Now I am to understand heaven holds two of the sisters, as they wait for the trio to be complete.So is this cd good? Is it a joke? Who knows. I only know that this cd represents a moment in my life where love, kitsch, champagne and joy all combined for a fantasy world. The sisters and their amazing arrangements are responsible for one of the defining moments of my life, and to them....I am eternally grateful"
4,Had to leave the lights on,"This book was a mixture of The Shining, It, and a cool detective novel. Some parts were scary enough for me to have to play a game after reading, so I would be able to sleep! I love ghost stories so this was my cup of tea. I'll look up more Kay Hooper novels after this."
2,Audio Book Review,"Listened to the audiobook. Originally thought it was more of a mystery/thriller novel, but it ended up being more of a romance novel instead. The first few chapters (disks) were engrossing enough to get me to listen through the end. But, the end itself and the second half of the book in gerneral was disappointing.As the novel moves more from paranormal mystery to romance in tenor it bogs down quite a bit. It's not horrible, but I can't recommend it given the opportunity cost of bypassing something more interesting."
3,"I'm a huge Kay Hooper fan, but..... (spoilers!)","I've been anxiously awaiting this latest book in the SCU series but I must admit to being a little disappointed. I love the psychic element of these books and could even deal with the ghosts wandering around (the surprise about the little girl and her dog was quite good), but when the murderer turns out to be someone who has been dead for a hundred years, that was too much for me. Please keep writing these SCU books, but I'd prefer them to be a bit more believable. And I'd love to see some of the characters we've already gotten to know....like some more cases solved by Bishop, Miranda or Galen. It appears once you're married off in this series, you can't play an active role anymore.I really do love Kay Hooper's books, love her characters and love the concept, and I did enjoy this book which is why I gave it three stars, but it wasn't my favorite."
3,A fast-paced read,"It is advertised as a Bishop/Special Crimes Unit but you see or hear very little of Bishop. Quentin Hayes is given the okay by his boss at the FBI to continue his search for what happened to his friend Missy Turner twenty five years ago. He encounters Diana Brisco, exhausted and trying to recover from medications prescribed by her doctors for her as of yet unknown psychic abilities. There are many extraneous, under-developed characters; some real some not. This paranormal, conspiracy, murder, struggling romance, takes place against the lush backdrop of a Victorian era mansion in the hills of Tennessee. Characters and plots of past novels have invoked more enthusiasm and interest. Nevertheless, Chill of Fear is a quick, some-what satisfying summer read"
2,Not a great mystery.... not a romance,"I got about one third of the way through before giving up on this book. Without knowing anything about the author, it seems like a romance novelist trying to write a mystery, and I think readers of both genres will be disappointed in this book.This is my first Amazon book review, from an avid mystery reader who hopes to write more reviews to help others as I have been helped by these reviews. I am not overly critical of books and if it's an enjoyable read, that's what matters to me. I won't spoil the plot, but will give my honest opinion."
3,nor her best,"This one is hard to get into. The heroine is not that interesting. The ""killer"" is a major disappointment."
2,Doesn't fully nail either the suspense or romance genres,"Interesting and original, but I would have liked to see more of the supposedly romantic development between Diana and Quentin. Also, because so much of the ""suspense"" part of the story was background info. and previous incidents, it just didn't give me the same sense of urgency as a suspense novel should. Not bad, but not really good either."
3,Just OK,By reading the reviews here I thought it might be a better story. I am not a huge paranormal fan . It didnt entice me to want to read any more books in her series.
2,Not as Good,"I am a big Kay Hooper fan and have been looking forward to this installment since the day I finished the last one, last year. I am very dissappointed in this one, it wasn't quite worth the wait. I did enjoy it, but it doesn't have the grip her stories usually do. The characters didn't have the strong connections of most, they seemed to be lacking a little bit. The ending was unsatisfying for me. The interaction between Bishop and the other characters was almost nonexistant, and that was a little let down as well. In her other books he has always taken a big roll in the story even if it was behind the scenes. To see him left to minor mentions left the story out of balance to me. I will continue to read this series, but may not rush out on release day and drive around town to find it."
3,Disappointing,"Not up to Kay Hooper's usual standard. First, the story was a lot darker and more disturbing than her other books. Second, there was no romance. I repeat: no romance. The mystery was just okay. My advice: skip this one. I love all her other stuff."
4,Excellent !!!,"This was my first time reading Kay Hooper. The ""Fear Books"" are going to be the next books I read. This was a hard book to put down book. The story had you constantly wondering what was going to happen next and who did it. I would recommend this for anyone who like a good mystery."
3,disappointing,"Although I liked the idea of someone believing themselves mentally ill actually being psychic, I didn't find this book very engaging. This book lacked the warmth and depth of character relationships shown in Ms Hooper's previous books and was more a duty than a pleasure to complete. Some of the plot was also too unbelievable even for this genre."
4,Bucky Shades,"I am a eye shade addict and I have tried many different types. This is one of my favorites. It is easy to position for side sleeping, it is soft and keeps 98% of the light out, a little leaks in around the nose. My only complaint is that they are fairly stiff. I have washed them twice so far and they are getting softer but still a little stiff. The ear plug holder on the front is a fantastic idea, love it! All in all, a very nice eye shade!"
2,Not for me,"Quality is fine, but I sleep on my side, If you are a side sleeper, this mask is too bulky and bunch up between your face and the pillow.... I need to find something much thinner, but just as sturdy....."
4,Holiday Cheer,"With his light blue, snoflake covered body and cute blue scarf, how can you not at least crack a smile? For the Ty Beanie bears, this one is definately cute. It brings a good feeling to you, and is a great collecter's item. Though maybe not the most fun to play with, I think little children will enjoy it. More elaborate bears have been made over time, but most of them are still of the same quality as this one. So if you want a cute holiday bear, I recommend this one."
2,"great, but annoying","Its great, except for the bubbles and wrinkles in the plastic. When it shrinks, it wrinkles."
4,Bennie Meets The Top Tenors,"No need to buy expensive imports. Bennie's whole Blue Note output is right here 5 Lps on 3 CD's- 1 with Charlie Rouse, 2 with hard nosed Eddie Williams, 1 with Gene Ammons and Billy Root and 1 with Stanley Turrentine and Ike Quebec. It's a good blowout. Ballads too."
4,toll logic credit card multi tool,"nice little thing to keep in my wallet. i use the scissors, tweezers and the knife the most. You won't be hanging out with Bear Grylis in the alpines with it, but it does come in handy all the time. this is not a hard use type product like a leatherman but it works great for work, around the house and such."
2,leveling bubble,I ordered one of these tripods and it did not have a leveling bubble as described. I was disappointed.
1,yuck,Don't bother. Too fake. Too silly. I did not make it through the first 45 minutes. I am sure I won't ever finish watching it.
5,Nice homage to classic horror.,"Nice horror flick reminiscent of classic horror flicks of 70's and 80's . It is a fun , unpretentious horror slasher flick. It is a good movie for what it's budget is, it is a great low budget horror flick. This is a keeper for me."
1,TAKE A BUS INSTEAD,"CREEP VAN may be considered a throwback to 80s horror movies, but unfortunately bad horror movies.The violence and sex are merely manipulative, exploitative and gratuitous. Little imagination or plot coherency is evidenced and the resolution predictable.In essence, CREEP VAN is one to avoid!"
3,A Patchy Album,"A typical latter-day Gil Evans job, rather loose and sprawling at times. 'Copenhagen Nights' is an embryonic version of 'London', 'Sirhan's Blues' peters out inconclusively, 'Stone Free' and 'Orange...' are pretty good versions. The gem here is 'Zee Zee', a long, deathly slow blues with an intense trumpet solo that just keeps going and going. Worth picking up, if you get it cheap."
3,Jam & Spoon  - Stella 1999-1992,"STELLA gets a 7-years later remake, and while the new ""Radio Mix"" with the additional vocals isn't an abomination, let's just say that it was an ill-advised move nonetheless. The ""Storm Mix"" puts the track strongly in club-trance territory, with little of the original initially except for a few plinks here and there, before those trademark synths and vocals come in halfway through, and turning to some breaks at the breakdown at the 2/3rd mark. Jam & Spoon try their own hand with the ""Return of Stella '99"" mix, bringing in some funky electro breaks, an interesting direction that's also picked up Nalin & Kane on the start of their mix (they, of course, soon move into mellow club territory with little bits of guitar and the vocals in the mix). But really? Stick with the original each and every time."
5,He Beat Them All,"In an era of great middleweights, Sugar Ray beat them all. He had every attribute of a great fighter: grace, skill, punch, speed, courage, durability. Undefeated welterweight king, he was five times middleweight champion who collapsed from the heat while leading for the lightheavyweight crown.This is a good summary of his long career, starting with the Golden Gloves. Oddly enough, it does not mention the draw he fought for the championship at the age of 44 or show the right handed punch that blinded champion Carmen Basilio and enabled Sugar Ray to win the belt again."
1,worst of the series,"This is without question the worst of the series. Typos, black pearls, text often doesn't refer to the pictures at all. Better than nothing...I suppose, but really substandard. I hope they didn't pay a real editor for this sloppy work.Not worth waiting for."
2,below average,"The diagnoses are well chosen. Images are not perfect but in most cases good enough to see the pertinent findings. Everything goes downhill from here.What was most troubling was that the book contains many factual innacuracies (confusing intra/extra lobar sequestration, creutzfeld-jacob virus as the causative factor in PML, I could go on and on. After doing half of the cases, I stopped believing much of what the authors had to say in the discussions.Many typos which did not bother me. Annoying unrelated questions and long useless discussions. Poor differentials in most cases. Their differential for a JNA was every tumor under the sun that could happen in the nasopharynx of a teenage boy.Having said all that, there are very few case related resources for the orals in pediatrics. I think that for $40, this book is still better than nothing. Each case often has more than one image so that at least you get a sense of what the disease looks like on different modalities."
2,Agree with complaints,"If you were wondering, the poor reviews below are accurate. The book is okay, at best for its choice of topics and superficial discussions. However, the discussions have little to do with the images. There is no explanation of the findings. Altogether a terrible job putting this book together. It seems so obvious how to make a good case review book. This isnt it."
1,Worst of the Series!,"This is the worst of the Case Review series. It has poor image quality. The cases and images are poorly chosen and are not representative of classic presentations. The format is not differential diagnosis-based, which is inappropriate for an oral boards review book.Most times, unless the reader absolutely knows everything about the case, one can't figure out what the confusing and poor quality images show. Try to even find a differential diagnosis in the rambling explanations and you may be eligible for a cash prize!!!"
4,This IS a reasonable book,"This book provides a good review of pediatric radiology. The cases are appropriate and discussed well (a couple typos don't bother me too much), and the images may be on the small side but are definitely diagnostic. Emphasis on pathophysiology was a real strength. I'm not entirely sure what the controversy is about. It's actually an improvement not to be handed the diagnoses in the questions."
4,Pony up and buy the book,"Sure this book is getting some flack from reviews and my fellow collegues, but if you want some more cases to review for Peds oral boards, this has been a good place to go after reading Donnelly (I've learned some new things from the cases). And let's face it, there are not that many Radiology Peds review books. The questions take a little getting use to. Although some of the questions may not be directly related to the case at hand, most appeared relavant: either pearls or related to the topic (aka pimp questions). One strength to the book was that good differentials were given. As with the other case review books, it would be nice to have a sentence or two describing the findings in the images, since the findings are not always apparent (to me) and would be helpful for studying for the descriptive component for oral boards."
2,better than nothing,"Quick release is a poor design. The plate is difficult to tighten, and even at that, slight camera movement loosens it off. The interface between plate and tripod is poor too, made of plastic, the tolerances to fit are sloppy and there is a little snap mechanism to hold the securing latch that loses tension over time, rendering it useless. As a tripod, it is very unsteady with center mast extended and lowest legs extended. If used with just the legs splayed and the camera bag looped over the legs for weight/ballast, it does a fine job, and in that respect, better than nothing. All locks work well with the exception of the plate latch/lock which is the most important one. This tripod is relegated to holding a flash for me.Save your money and buy something more substantial."
4,Very good tutorial,"Too many books on vb concetrate too much on the interface, rather than on decent code. There is no use in fancy, flashy gui's with poor code behind it. The first half of the book gives you the foundation you need to write good vb code. There are also challenging excercises, too many books stay with ""easy"" excercises and thereby give the illusion that you master the material, this book keeps you modest.The second part of the book covers subjects to more advanced topics of vb, but not in depth. A negative point is the terrible color used in the book."
1,"Run, Run, Don't Look Back!","After reading the book through twice, I have found it not only confusing but positivly frustrating. There is no way to follow the code examples straight out of the book and expect them to run in the normal compiler. You MUST use the CD which is poorly laid out and a simulation of a vb enviornment. Code Explaination was cryptic, and Examples although ample were useless because they would not compile. This is the second Deitel book I have read in the past 6 months and both were a poor experience. Even the instructor sent us out to find a better book."
5,One of the Greatest of All Foreign Films,"I loved this picture in its initial American release, returned to see it three times theatrically, have watched it six or seven times in the subsequent years, and gave the old MGM dvd to many people, all of whom shared my enthusiasm for such a magical film. The Taviani brothers mix realism and poetry to shattering effect; there are scenes and images, both comic and tragic, that I'll wager will stick with you a lifetime. They certainly have for me. Essential (and immensely pleasurable) viewing."
4,Best foreign film,"I really can't think of any other non-english film I like better than this one. I suppose ""Ran"" and ""Crouching Tiger"" are more skillfull, but this is the one I keep shoving back into the VCR over and over again. It's just extraordinary and one to own."
3,Not for beginner!,"People who willing to buy this book must have adequate background of both Java programming and VRML. This book provide the ""bridge"" of Java and VRML but it is not provide enough example for each topic. It mostly emphasises on theoretical not practical application. Unfortunately, there is not much book in this stream so I would say this book is okay."
5,Great book,I bought a copy when it was available . Its a great book. It gives an insight on java 3D.
3,book did not come,"I ordered a book from this seller, they shipped it within 2 days but it never came. I contacted the seller and they very quickly responded and refunded my account. Even though I never received my book, because of their quick response and quick solution to the matter I would recommend them again! The have other quick and great reviews which makes them a safe and appropriate place to order from!"
3,Well it was ok but...,"well i just wish that in this selection there should be alot more songs like "" faith "" personally i think that was the best thing about the entire album.And if you disagree the e mail me."
4,it is the greatest.....,BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!

4,Do not buy this from Eauction!!! You will get another brand.,"The dried mangoes are great. They are a little bit too sweet though. Anyway, once you start to eat it, it's kinda difficult to stop.WARNING!! If you want to buy this dried mangoes,Phillipine Brand. DO NOT buy from Eauction. I placed an order with them, but got the Royal brand which is cheaper and doesn't taste as good. I just want to warn everybody about this seller."
3,They were ok.,But nothing like the Cebu Philippine Dried Mango you get in Japan :( I've been trying to search for that brand for months... But no luck.
4,Tasty and sweet,This was some good mango. But there were too much sugar in it. Otherwise it is fresh and tasty. It's a little bit pricy though. You can buy this at Costco for half the price.
3,Great--minus the large sugar infusion,"The dried mangoes are delicious. That said--way too sweet. They are coated in so much sugar. I dipped the pieces into a bowl of water to get some of it off. Such a shame, as it is difficult to find fresh dried mangoes. All in all: Great--minus the large sugar infusion."
2,Recipe Error,"Photos are beautiful and recipes are inspirational, but the first one I tried, ""Croissant Cinnamon Raisin Buns"", seems to have a major error. The ratio of liquid to flour (2-1/2 cups milk plus 1/3 cup water to 4 cups of flour) makes a dough so thin it can be ""poured out"" but not ""rolled out"" as instructed. Hopefully, the remaining recipes are more accurate."
2,Good value but not as advertised.,"This Hakuba carbon fiber tripod is a lightweight well-made item that provides good value for the price. However, it is NOT the Velbon CARMAGNE 640 advertised. The CARMAGNE is a carbon fiber tripod with a magnesium top - hence the name CAR (for carbon) MAGNE (for magnesium). The item offered is the cheaper version manufactured by Hakuba (which I believe is the parent company of Velbon) and has ALUMINUM components, not magnesium..."
4,Great Product,"The product itself was fabulous--just as advertised, complete with all pieces and parts. I found it reasonably simple to install with just occasional assist from my husband for an extra pair of hands. We LOVE our new closets. Only problem we had was that one of the two closet organizers that we ordered arrived damaged and unusable. We returned it, but could not get an immediate replacement. Amazon paid return shipping and provided a full refund and I was able to get the replacement through a local retailer."
2,Not worth the money,I purchased this item and was very disappointed. Some of the corners were damaged in shipping because it was not packaged adequately. Most of the shelves and vertical panels had the finish chipped along the edge. Half of the rods were pressed into ovals when they should have been round. The chipped edges were not the result of the shipping but just an inferior product. Not something I want to spend $$$ on and put up in my house.
1,Poor packaging on Heavy Product = Crushed Corners,"I had to return this as the box was crushed and burst open on two corners so the particle board laminated surface was damaged. I had to ask for an RMA to return it- and would be reluctant to reorder since the packaging is inadequate...whether or not the product is marvelous, bad packaging can render it useless."
5,Dog breeder's seal of approval!,"I breed and raise AKC Chinese Cresteds-- all of which live in my home with my family-- and I swear by this product! It takes out ALL odors quickly and safely, leaving behind a mild clean scent. It works so well it even takes out the smell of whelping (birth.) I use it for everyday clean up as well as the deep down cleaning. We use it on every surface including the furniture and the carpets, and we've NEVER had an issue with stains or bleaching. KOE is quite expensive, but it is well worth the price. There is never any residue left over and I've never seen any adverse reaction in any of our dogs, not even the brand new puppies! We keep a weak mixture in a spray bottle for everyday use and a stronger mix under the sink for the really tough stuff. We even use it outside in the dog yard to keep the concrete and gravel areas smelling nice, and it doesn't hurt the grass. This product has the AlmostNakedPups.com seal of approval!"
1,I hated it,"If you locked a bunch of monkeys in a room with a typewriter for one day, what they wrote would be better than this awful garbage."
3,"Great camera tripod, fair video tripod","The Velbon CX570 is an inexpensive starter tripod that is unusually stable and strong. For camera work, the 3-way pan head is just fine, but for video work the up/down vertical pan is pretty rough and jerky, even with a little added-on silicon paste lubricant. Horizontal pan is quite smooth, though, and the bubble level is a very nice addition, too. Legs extend easily and lock tight. Overall, I'd give it a 3 or 4 star rating, a bit higher if the head was individually replaceable with a more fluid head when the budget permits (the base is great, though)."
5,Velbon Quality,"I've been taking professional pictures for over 25 years. Velbon has always been one of the tripods ""professionals on a budget"" have used. This tripod is not the lightest, nor most portable tripod in the world, but is excellent stability, nice feature set, and outstanding price, make it a super bargain. It is stable enough for the most demanding professional work, can accommodate either a still or video camera, and has a built in level that is large enough to actually be usable. I wish it came with a travel bag, but beyond that it is an excellent tripod."
2,Bad!,"Why on earth did I listen to the hype and buy TWO Marah CD's? This band is pretty bad, just all-around boring. I thought Philly was supposed to rock! Oh well, so much for reputations.Seriously though, don't spend your money on this CD - you'll probably be disappointed as I was - just another example of lowest-common-denominator music which they, for some inexplicable reason, choose to call ""Rock-n-Roll""."
1,Pretty bad.,"Tired music, worn cliches, and a lead vocalist so lackluster and vapid it's almost comical. Why do people seem to like this alt-country band so much? They sound like drunken, talentless idiots, desperately trying to imititate Springsteen, Lou Reed, the Band. I sure hope Philadelphia has better bands than this! Disappointing."
4,Great CD for fans of Roots music,"If you are a fan of the ""Roots"" music movement, then buy this CD. There will be natural comparisons to Wilco and Son Volt but the best comparison to a band I can think of is ""The Band"". Check this CD out."
2,Medicore at best,"I hate to say it, but this record is mediocre at best. I haven't had the privilege of seeing Marah live but I am not impressed with this studio effort. To compare this band with others such as Whiskeytown, Wilco, and Son Volt is unrealistic. Marah's sound, while somewhat catchy, is a bit hollow for my tastes. I listened to this album time and again and just don't hear the brilliance that was promised. Sorry, but better luck next time."
4,Album Of The Year,The production Paul Smith has acomplished here is truly remarkable. It is also worth mentioning that Marah may just be the last rock and roll band worth giving a crap about. Buy this record!
5,"""Album Of The Year""","The production Paul Smith has acomplished here is truly a masterpiece. It is also worth mentioning that Marah may actually be the last rock and roll band that actually matters. Buy this record, now."
4,It sounds even better than (though not as long as) the title,"Marah blows a breath of fresh and eclectic air into the alt-country (or whatever it's being called today) universe. There's a vast range of musical styles on this album. 'Eventually Rock' & 'Head On' insist that you turn up the volume. The rollicking ""Fever"", the dirty gospel ditty ""Boat"", & the philosophical ""Baby Love"" are all over the map, but they all have a 'damn, that's good"" quality to them. They even got Phillies announcer Harry Kalas to intro ""Rain Delay"". I'm not a Phillies fan, but it's hard to not love Harry. The highlight for me is the insistent, relentless ""Limb"", which fades out into a mixture of bagpipes and some guy snoring. It's not exactly 'A Day in the Life', but it works.All in all, a catchy, terrific album and one of the best of 98!"
5,my favorite cd,"let's cut the crap and hook up latter on tonight is a great cd,with a great title i might add. it has remained one of my favorite cds since its release in early 1998,marah also puts on an amazing show!!"
3,alternative source,"for the same intellectual content.All the collections are available on NBER website, and I don't understand why the book is so expensive."
5,Excellent Biography for Aspiring Doctors,I purchased this book for my 11 year old daughter who has shown a great interest in science. She enjoyed it thoroughly. Blackwell's story is an inspiration to anyone and this book does an excellent job of telling it in a way that a child can fully appreciate. The book is fast-paced enough to keep a young reader's attention yet with enough detail to give them a full picture of the medical pioneer's life. The narrative is supported by a number of text boxes containing background information which truly round out the story. The overall result is that the reader leaves the book with a sense that they know not only about Blackwell but also about the context in which Blackwell made her achievements. I cannot recommend this book enough to anyone looking with a daughter interested in sciences and history.
2,Billy Blanks fat blaster/ cardio/ab work out dvd's,"I purchased combo dvd from Wal-Mart stores The dvd's repeatly kept skipping and therefore I wasn't able to obtain a good workout. Once the dvd's were purchased and opened, they cannot be returned, only exchanged. I did exchanged the dvd for the exact item, only to learn that the dvd were skipping. I had to visit the store on three seprate occassions due to the dvd's repeatly kept skipping. I would like to be assured that if I were to purchase my workout dvd through mail, that I would not get any defected dvd. I looking forward to a prompt response to this matter."
3,Not complete set,"I just received this set. The weekly workout plan lists a cardio dvd that is not included in this set. I already opened the dvds, so I can't get a full refund. Like another member stated, you can get a 5 dvd set elsewhere for $37.68. I wish I would have investigated further before I bought. Very disappointing. I haven't tried the workout yet because I want the cardio dvd so I can follow the plan."
5,Billy is busting my butt,This workout is great! I have been doing it for a week and I can already see some great results! The cast is fun and motivating throughout the whole workout. It works me out without breaking my bones. I have knee problems and cannot run long distance anymore. This is a fun alternative to that. I look forward to being encouraged and challenged by Billy and the Team every time!
3,NOT like Tae-Bo,"I bought this thinking it would be more like Billy's other workouts. This is less aerobic and much more toning oriented. Lots of leg lifts, sit ups etc. It is a thorough work out but a lot of it I could do on my own, I want Billy to think up all those great combinations for me!"
1,Ordered One set and received 2 and had to pay for 2,"I ordered one set of Billy Blanks tapes and was sent 2 sets and had to pay for two. When I contacted the manufacturer, they said I must have ordered another set from someone else on Amazon and it wasn't their problem."
1,LIGHT YOUR MONEY ON FIRE gives you better results,"I had this new in the box, paid $100 for it, Special School Edition,Intel Sold their responsibility of it to Digital Blue, they refuse any helpin getting it to work. Windows Vista or Windows 7 are completely incompatible.If a company is so willing to abandon all responsibility for their productline, they are not making quality, have no ethics and are only their to takeyour money. Thieves is another word that comes to my mind, crooks, charlatans,con artist, generally the type of people that are the problem with this world."
4,It is a toy and a very good one.,If you keep in mind that it is a toy it's quite good. The 10x setting is most used because I haven't had very good results using the 60x and 200x. My grand kids like it and that's what counts!
3,Cheap price cheap toy!,"It's not as good a toy for kids (5~9 yr-old)...My kids do not play with the toy anymore after their first exposure.The reason: they said they had a hard time adjusting image.Spent sometimes on the toy myself, and I couldn't believe there is so much of latency in the image. You could get a clear image of the dead bug sample--only after numerous incremental fine adjustments. You really have to wait a few seconds after you'd made one adjustment. Or else, the sample image wouldnot appear at all. On top of this, if you switch from 10X to 60X, you have to manupulate the sample position to get it back to view and then spend the time to make the fine adjustment again.The adjustment mechanism itself must have made of plastic gears, for you can hear the grinding and feel heavy friction at work.No wonder why they can't play with it like any other good toy.You got what you paid for ..."
2,very disappointed,I just returned it. The image was so poor that above minimum magnification I couldn't even tell what I was looking at.It would have been a fantastic item if they had just used a better CCD. The plastic moving parts were very imprecise also.I gave it two stars just because the idea is excellent.I would gladly pay 20 dollars more for a decent image sensor.Oh well.
4,Good investment,The Digital Blue microscope is a handy item to have around. If you have kids they can have lots of fun with it. It's not perfect but it does make nice pics on the computer that you can send anywhere. I found it very touchy to focus so patience is necessary as with most microscopes.A great buy!Bob
5,"Great buy, nothing better out there","For the price, wow! I agree with the previous reviewer, the image isn't the greatest, but this is a microscope with three kinds of magnfication, so who cares. Besides, you can use a desktop light or flashlight to shine on the subject and the image really improves.Also the software is really easy to use and has a cool time lapse feature. Bottom line, you can't get a microscope with live video to your computer ANYWHERE for even CLOSE to this price!"
5,Easy to install/use,"Kids had fun with it but if they aren't interested in learning about our microscopic world, they will quickly lose interest. Works great with the companion slides (added price)"
5,Wonderful Toy but.... Buy the model up,I own the QX3+ it is a model up and is well worth the other [money]. It has much more software things and can go to better graphics.As for the QX3 I have one for my classroom and the kids love it. I find them begging me to let them use it every day.My kids love the QX3+ at home. I kinda find my self playing on both of them ALL the time. Go ahead spend the money it will be fun for both you and your kids.
3,Cat Stevens Live,"The quality of the video is at least very good, perhaps borderline excellent. However, the downer is that there's only 8 songs plus a strange animated film at the end and totals about 35 minutes. It leaves you wanting more. Bang for the buck, it's 3/5. Actual performance and quality of filming is at least 4/5. I don't believe I've ever seen this particular performance, but have seen at least one other one with similar songs."
4,If you can overlook the rest,"Cat Stevens is a controversial figure; given the world as it is today, his conversion to Islam and self-identification with some of its political themes is enough for some people to avoid him altogether.Frankly, I understand and respect those who would choose to not buy ""Cat Stevens"" music. But, there is no replacement for his folk rock lilting voice and gentle lyrics. Maybe I shouldn't like the album, but I loved the hits and they still register."
2,DVD- Cat Stevens - Yusuf Islam,"This DVD is announced as if Yusuf Islam was singing the old songs of Tea for the Tillermans album, in a new video ,since its dated (1997) but its only an old recopilation of the videos you find in You Tube of Cats Stevens first years. The video quality is poor. If you are a Cats Stevens fan you will buy it just to have and ""old document"" in your library of interesting DVD's."
2,to wash or not.....,"Well, if you BBQ alot and you are a fan, you can wear this proudly. So,reason for the low rating? When you wash it, the logos start peeling off. Not after your 10th, or the 50th wash... after the 1st wash, the logo started peeling off.So I guess it's a great apron if you don't plan on washing it =)"
1,Poor quality DOA!,"I bought this charger to keep the battery on my Classic 380SL topped off during storage months.I didn't get around to using it until the warranty had expired.When I went to hook it up, nothing!! Defective out of the box.If you buy one of these, and I don't recommend you do, be sure and test it as soon as you receive it."
2,Digilux Zoom is a bad decision.,"Think of buying the Digilux Zoom? Let me help you make a more informed decision. The Digilux was Leica's first-born in the digital world. While the lens stands up to the Leica name, the body and electronics (outsourced to Fuji) do not. My Digilux Zoom broke TWICE, each time exhibiting the same malfunction with the lens motor. While Leica was very helpful in replacing the camera, I strongly urge you against this purchase. Instead, make a long-term decision and consider Leica's second-born - the new 3.9 mega-pixel Leica Digilux. It stands up to the Leica name and also comes with a 2-year warranty... a nice plus in the ever-evolving world of digital photography."
5,Brand Quality & finish,"Leica is not popular amongst the American public as being one of the world's best camera manufacturers. If you are looking for mid-level digital camera for family use, i would totally recommend the Leica Digilux Zoom. Easy to use, well designed and excellect results. Definate buy over the Fuji MX-1700 !!"
5,The best in canadian pop,"She's amazing, genius I would even venture to say. She was messing with R&B, turning it into something new before Alicia Keys or India Arie. She's been in the game since her days with Bass is Base. And she's even more amazing live than on her CD, though her tracks are delivered deliberatley, with creative melodies and italian influences. In other words, she's an audio visionary."
5,A Must Have,"Brown is probably one of the few albums I have never taken out of my cd changer. It puts you in a mellow, vibin' mood that few albums can do. It's not the typical cd when you love one or two songs and then the next ten or so are crap. EVERY song on Brown you will LOVE. I will be getting her new album Corduroy Boogie asap and another copy of Brown cause it's simply worn out."
2,Overated,"After listening to the album,'Brown', I was able to verify one thing about Ivana---that she is highly overated. The instramental back-up (her band) is absolutely incredible, but Ivana herself seems to fall short of them with her weak voice. The real star of the cd seems to be Oliver Johnson who's tight guitar keeps the album going strong. When is he going to release a cd?"
4,Smooth and Funky,"This CD is one that I always come back to. It's mix of funk, jazz and R&B is just right for so many times. Just carry this one in your pocket! Ivana may be young but she knows how to make noise."
3,It's fine but,"I found a ""baby"" related product at Whole Foods for a better price with higher Zinc content. Nothing wrong with product, it is as described."
1,French DVD,"I ordered the pope of Greenwich village, I had to wait 26 days for it to come. It was a Christmas present, I received it on Christmas Eve and it was LePape De Greenwich Village, which is in French. Are you kidding me. How come everytime I view my orders on amazon, they always show what I ordered, but then something off the wall gets delivered."
3,When Rourke looked like himself,It's an ok film. Darryl Hannah looks VERY hot in her undies. Rourke does a great job and Erik Roberts ain't bad at all. It's worth buying used.
3,Mickey Rourke at his charming best,"A pale imitation of Mean Streets, but worth seeing for Mickey Rourke's performance. Mr Rourke is witty, charming and stylish and wears his very eighties costumes with panache. His bouffant hairdo is a scream. He also blows smoke at pretty hatcheck girls with much style."
4,"ROURKE, ROBERTS, SINATRA SINGS ""SUMMER WIND""","What more can you ask for (Lou Monte doing LUNA LUNA LUNA, it's here). POPE is Vincent Patrick's best written work and his screenplay works with Rourke and Roberts doing each other justice in the lead roles. The inside buzz is Michael Cimino sat in the directors chair, but evidence to the contrary is offered: The film is less than 3 hours in length and significantly lacks metaphors. Instead, POPE is a raucous and likeable tale of NYC bottom feeders whose only place in Trump Tower would be behind a broom. Geraldine Page gives an Oscar nominated supporting turn one year before her Best Actress win for TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL. She's more enjoyable here."
5,One of my personal all time favorites!,"Great preformances buy three young rising stars. Hannah, Rourke and Roberts are superb."
3,An anomaly,"I want to give this movie four stars. I couldn't ever give it five because it leaves too many questions unanswered. (What's with Roberts' character, anyway?...And when he's walking across the boulevard arm in arm with Rourke, are they cousins or lovers?)But here's the real quandary. Have you ever seen Scorsese's Mean Streets? See it right before you watch this one, and tell me not how they are alike, but how they differ! How was it that no one got sued when Pope came out later? It's Mean Streets Lite (much as When Harry Met Sally is Annie Hall without the brilliance).But Pope has its share of terrific acting, and I mean terrific, and it has at least one indelible scene between Roberts and Tony Musante involving some payback. Roberts is the focus of the scene, but watch how Musante adds some surprising and appropriate pathos of his own."
4,Interesting look at life on the street!,I have to admit that I bought this movie because Mickey Rourke is in it. I thought that the story was interesting!
3,Cant you tell they're Irish?,"In contrast to these other goofs, Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts are Irish, not Italian."
2,Poor quality dvd,"I originally bought video at a big box store; it worked well for background & I was not displeased. However, the DVD cracked after only a few uses and would not play, something I've never had happen before. I ordered another copy online, and IT cracked after playing for only a few hours. Tried to contact company online without success; not worth dealing with snail mail. I'm just going to try a different DVD."
2,"Disappointing, Stick with blu-ray","Disappointing, Stick with blu-ray.Boring.You can turn the video off and just listen to the waves if you want."
1,A bit disappointing.,"I've had several of these types of silk pouches, some even passed down from generations. I purchased these to store additional pieces of jewelry. I was excited with the price and couldn't wait. Unfortunately, they are NOT made very well. They also make this crinkly sound, I'm assuming it's the plastic lining it has. Which is disappointing b/c I was expecting soft silk throughout. Also, a few of them broken when I went to unsnap them. The button just pulled straight through. VERY DISAPPOINTING! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
3,Silk Pouches,"I was looking to use these pouches as pill cases so an inside zipper was a must and, while the cost of the pouches was fair (even though I didn't need this many) and they were exactly what I was looking; however, I have one negative comment...the quality is disappointing. I have one in each of my pocketbooks. My black pocketbook is used the most and so is the pill case; however, the case is already starting to pull apart at the seams."
4,"Not ""Girlfriend"", but the title is true","""Girlfriend"" is my co-pick for the best album of the 90's, along with ""Spilt Milk"" by Jellyfish, but this album is one of my faves. I especially love ""Sick of Myself"" and ""Smog Moon"" - ""Get Older"" hits really close to home, but in a good way..."
4,"more consistent than ""Atered Beast"", but NOT ""Girlfriend""","More consistent than ""Altered Beast"", but seems to lack the standout hits.Good melodies, catchy tunes, better rock than is being written by 95% of the other rockers. At least Matthew Sweet remembers that rock songs have melodies and harmonies and a beat, and in that he is a throwback to the Golden Age of Rock.But this is NOT ""Girlfriend""!!!!"
3,"""sick of myself""-yeaaaaaa","i heard ""sick of myself"" on the radio back in the day and i was hooked from second number one. absolutely mesmerizing song. after that though, the cd doesnt do it for me. too watered down and just nto my style. but ""sick of myself""-if you like any type of rock, this song is phenomenal. buy it used just for that song."
5,100% is Quite a misnomer,"200% is much more appropriate. I have to say that I was first introduced to M. Sweet with 100% when it first came out. I got to see him in concert a week later and I have been a fan ever since. I went back and bought the rest of his cds and have to say 100% is one of my favorite cds of all time. I have to say his latest In Reverse is challenging it though. Overall I say this about Sweet: his lyrics are very well written, his guitar work is among the best ever, and his music is a God send.I recommend this cd as a definitely must have. I never get tired of it and the ladies love it. This is one of those cds that you can listen to straight through and never want to skip a song. I have to say that those type of cds are very hard to find.Matthew Sweet rocks!"
5,His Second Best Disk,"Girlfriend is a classic and maybe one day he will top it; 100% is real close - albeit much different in sound. The guitars are great especially on Sick of Myself, We're the Same and Get Older. We're the Same was also one of the best videos of the year. Kimi Ga Suki is the third best album."
3,70% great,3 1/2Pretty power pop with a few forgettable tracks showcases Sweet's sweet talents of fuzzed auditory confections.
2,Entering the vortex,"I love Matthew Sweet, and this disc has a few stellar songs on it. But, in general I have found each Mattew Sweet cd to be worse than the last. Unfortunately. If you are just looking into Matthew Sweet for the first time, I would send you first to ""Girlfriend"" and perhaps to ""Altered Beast"""
5,WOW,"Okay I have to admit I have been sleepin on CJ but I wont anymore. I thought he was like a more slowed R&B artist in which he is but isnt, but who cares because this CD is fire. So fire it made me go and get the other 2 CD's, This man is on to something and man I am glad I am on to it as well. GREAT GREAT GREAT, every track in on point and the sound is so good. If you dont have it get it because it is worth every dollar."
3,The Word to the world,"To each it's own and I was really look forward to the CD but in my humble opinion this CD was a step back. My view of the first CD was, ""This CD is more geared toward people who are transitioning from the world to the Word."", but I have to say this follow up CD - Love Jones is a CD that is more geared toward people who are transitioning from the Word to the world. In closing, it is not my job to judge anyone and I pray for everyone spirit, but my input and feels are honest and might be helpful to someone.Faith and Fear can not coexist in the same circumstance."
5,"C Jones, easliy does it.","I love this cd, It is definitely anointed. GOD is showing us just how universal HE really is through his son Canton Jones. I can play ""Love Jones"" in the house,in the car, at school, at work, at party, in the church and at somebody's grandmama's house! It just has a universal feel, you know. Among my favorites are ""Dance In the Spirit"", ""Birthday"", ""Fix it"" and ""Holla"" just because I had to narrow it down to a few. But I enjoy the whole album, really. I just hope Canton Jones keeps allowing the LORD to use him!"
3,Not my kinda Praise,"It is ok for ""holy hip hop"" lovers. It sounds and feel to ""wordly"". It did not take me into the realm of Godly praise."
2,Disatisfied,"Don't like the format of this product. Too juvenile. Would like it better in standard paperback size. That said, Poorfolks is a well-deserved classic. well"
3,Amazing prescience,"I gather that Puzo wrote this book long before 9/11. The narrative is spooky in that it parallels that event and the conspiracies that followed. The concern for loss of civil rights; the never ending central factor of the Israel-Palestine conflict; the bombing to rubble of a middle east capital city.All of this, read in light of what followed, would speak to Puzo's grasp of international skulduggery, long before most of us anticipated the coming tragedies. On this basis, alone, it is well worth reading."
5,One of the best novels which I've read till date,"The first time I read this book was in 1993 - borrowed from a friend, then I loved it so much that I bought the book and read it 2 more times. Probably the only book which I have read 3 times.This is one of the finest stories which tells the story of a President, Arabic and Italian radicals, An Airport worker by the name of Zonzi - who plan multiple terror attacks. You could almost relate to present day politics.Each one of the scenes still lingers in my mind 20 years on. It felt almost like a real story when the 9/11 happened, the ruthless Arabic terrorist by the name Yabril and an Italian who proclaims that 'God is the ultimate Terrorist'.This still remains one of the best novels which I have read till date."
5,Amazing Book by Puzo,"This is a great piece of work by Puzo. This book, which Puzo states was his biggest undertaking, has shown what hard work can do for an author. Puzo's detail to attention, not only in the character development, but the great conversation, is just superb. Everyone compares everything that Puzo has written to The Godfather, which this is not. But if you can separate his writing of The Godfather and put this in its own category...it is an amazing good."
4,the 4th Kennedy,It is a book that I have read before . It's good to know there are writers that can think CRAZY !!
3,More like 3 and 1/2,"This book is very enjoyable while at the same time being very implausible. I personally do not think that another Kennedy would get elected in this day of conspiracy theories and suchlike.As books go it's main fault is that it over reaches, trying to be too many things all at the same time.It's main story line centers around a potentially deadly series of assignation attempts that include various world figures.There are also 3 sub plots that are pulled off with varying degrees of successes.I'm not saying that this isn't a good read, its just that when all is said and done and the book is finished you have a very unsatisfied feeling in the pit of your stomach. Don't forget that too much is going on all at once, things can get confussing."
1,There's a reason this book is out of print.,"It's hard to believe this book was written by the author of The Godfather. This one falls far, far short of that classic in terms of plot, character development, and any other criterion you can name. It was one of those books that I regretted having continued to the end."
1,what a tanker,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The characters are all over the place, the plot meanders and Puzo can't decide if it's set in the future or the present. (He invents a futuristic chemical brain scan as a convenient plot device, yet the story is set in present time.)One particularly irritating facet of this book was that the few women in it are in very minor roles, even the Vice President, and are invariably described in terms of their sex lives.As for the plot being ""parallel"" to our current troubles in the Middle East and with terrorism, these problems are nothing new and have been around in various forms for decades. The US isn't known for learning from its mistakes.This is the only book that I have ever thrown into the trash. I read it on a plane and tossed it into a trash can on my way to the baggage claim. It felt great."
4,Puzo without the mafia? And it's still a good read?,"In this novel Puzo steps out of his standard world of massive corruption (mafia), into another, politics. The book is fast moving and if you read the cover jacket it only tells about the first quarter of the book. There is much more. It is a sttory of a man who tries his best to be a decent man, but after a string of horrible events that ruin everything he has once held dear, he slowly makes the transition to ""the dark side"". With subtle change you watch the character of Francis Kennedy turn from a man of honor to a man of evil. Some of the elements of the book are completely unbelievable, but isn't that what fiction is for?"
1,What a waste of paper !,"The publisher must have thought that anything Puzo wrote was gold as thisappeared a few years ago and rightfully disappeared.The main characters, Francis Xavier Kennedy, his friends and staff are completely unconvincing and cardboard cutouts.The assassination of his daughter holds no suspense or regret as she is a cardboard character like the rest of them.Needless characters and unnecessary plot lines appear to confuse the reader.Remember that 1/3 of ""The Godfather"" was junk about Jules the doctor and his love affair with Sonny Corleone's lover.The movie thankfully cut out the waste and was the better without it.""The Fourth K"" is all fat and no meat.They are re-releasing it to coincide with""The Godfather Returns"" and terrorists assaults on US soil.Avoid this book!"
2,"Lightweight, but weak link is connection to equip","This is not my primary tripod. It is being used for binoculars while I'm out at the telescope and is probably light enough to carry in a backpack. Seems strudy enough, but it has shortcomings right at the most important link. The quick release shoe is a small plastic piece held into the tripod by a plastic cam. The 1/4""x20 screw that holds binocs (with binoc adapter) or camera or a small telescope is tightened by a tiny plastic knob from underneath the quick release shoe before the shoe is locked onto the tripod head using the cam. This tiny knob is too small to be tightened securely using fingers and you must use a coin, not a screw driver, to tighten it securely. It still comes loose. The lightest most compact, sturdiest tripod is no good if your equipment can't be attached securely and part way through a session swings loose and swivels to one side requireing releasing the shoe and retighteneing the screw. ..."
3,Save your $$$,"You'd be just as well served by picking up a (much less costly) copy of Another Mother Further, the gem that pretty much defines Mothers Finest and a good deal of which comprises this import best of."
4,It's really cute.,"I got this b/c I really like Tenchi Muyo. It's not Tenchi Muyo, but I really enjoyed it. It focuses on a group of friends and the strengthening of their relationships with each other. I think it's geared more toward younger viewers, but it teaches a lot of important life lessons. It's a lot of fun and for the price you can't go wrong."
4,A little meatier than season one,"My daughter loves Sasami and I don't wonder why. Sasami's character is kind of airheaded, but has a heart of gold. Season one was pretty light fare, a little bit of emotional problems were dealt with, but nothing that might upset any but the most sensitive young viewers. Season two gets a meatier story line, but I believe that it still falls well within ""PG"" guidelines. It aims to show how not all deception is obvious, but all still ends well, with the villians converted to the side of the good guys."
4,Diamond files,"for the most part these are good files, not great, just good. I use them in flint knapping (making arrow points}, the smaller files don't hold the diamond dust like I hoped they would. Some of the big files are too big for the work I do."
5,A Complete Explanation and guide to Christian Music,"This book is perfect for our times. It is my experience that churches, pastors and congregations are totally confused and uninformed regarding music for their church. Mr. Miller gives a fair and complete explanation of all kinds of music and what it means. The objective view is based on the Bible. I think before we can argue about the ""Comtemporary Christian Music Debate"" we need to be well informed on every level. Mr. Miller does just that. The book helps to clarify what is true and what we have heard from others. Every Christian needs to be informed on this subject. His research is both fascinating and extensive. This unique treasure of information is a must for anyone searching true answers on Christian Music.Francine Larson, Co-Author of ""Character Keys to a Bright Future."""
5,The Organ was a Sin,There are so many interesting facts in this book. Myfavorite is that the organ was considered a sinful instrument to use in church when it first was introduced. Funny how the organ is being replaced by keyboards now. It is all relative - so many churches live and die on minor issues..sad..what would Jesus think?
1,NOT the Original Artists,"Despite the names of the artists listed for these tracks, these are all re-recordings by anonymous singers and studio musicians. They're anonymous for a reason. Buy the originals and make your own mix tape."
4,Tough to test,"Packaging is good for storing in a ready-to-grab location long term. Item promises to provide protection I sought, when needed, and this is a well regulated and litigous industry so that bodes well. I am satisfied I made a good ""preventative"" purchase, offering peace of mind, but couldn't go 5 stars due to unknowns lingering. If I have to use it and its works I'd obviously be in a 6 star mood, but if it doesn't work I won't be around to reveal that opinion."
4,Aquatic yet Spacy ambient music.,"I bought this cd upon hearing their remix of Coldcut's ""Autumn Leaves"" on the Two A.D. Waveform compilation. The aquatic and bubblely sound of that one song is present throughout this entire album.This cd is almost completely void of any rhythm or beats, yet it isn't typical of motionless ambient or space music either. It's definately a chill-out album - trippy, dubby, with alot of trickling synth effects yet no real melodies - yet gives one the sensation of being underwater.This CD is best played at night at medium volume in a blue lit roon with the lava lamps."
5,Wonderful book.,"I was looking for an essential grammar book to improve myself. And amazingly, I came across this book in the library and decided to have a look at it. I'm truly amazed by how organised and logical their explanations are. In the end, I went to buy a copy of this book as a reference book for myself. Now, I will be getting another copy for my boyfriend as well. Truly recommended grammar book!"
1,The arrow keys are wrong!,I liked the keyboard except that the up and down arrow keys are not between the left and right arrow keys. It's utterly frustrating.
1,Don't Bother,"Bought locally. While I trust the strips for Ph, it said my water had low hardness. I have the hardest water in the known universe. All the tests in this kit said I had the best water on the planet.They offer three mail-in tests for $15 each. I suspect that is what this kit is about.Maybe I'll buy a better kit..."
3,Couldn't tell if it worked.,"I was hoping I could get some answers about what is in our water because my hair just feels full of junk. Anyway, I followed the directions like it stated but everything came out perfectly normal so not sure if this product works. It does state on the sheet enclosed that the results aren't 100% accurate. I'm not sure if I recommend spending your money on this product. Better to have a professional come out and test your water if you have the money and really need to know what's in it."
3,Not enough resolution,"Worked fine but you can only tell your hardness to 10 grains at the upper level. Not good enough to set a water softener by. If you want to know if you have hard or soft water then this kit is ok but if you need to know exact hardness don't get this kit. It is also good for determining dissolved Iron and Chlorine. However, it is no clear wether this measures Chloramine."
1,Not worth the money,"You will receive one test strip for chlorine, so if you make a mistake or expected to be able to do more than one test, you're out of luck. Other test kits provide numerous strips so testing can be done as needed, not just once. Do not waste your money for one test."
4,Review of The Might and the Almighty,"Albright offers insight and opinions on world affairs never before introduced in a public forum. Her theories are thought-provoking, and at the very least, worthy of consideration."
4,Great History of the Middle East,Mrs Albright has a strong grasp of Middle Eastern history as well as Islam. A good quick read by a very moderate voice.
3,So Much Potential... But Failed To Come Through,"I read this book because the premise of incorporating religion into foreign policy seemed to be a subject frought with potential and controversy. Sadly, I found that Ms. Albright did not develop the discussion to what it could (should?) have been. Many of her statements reflect PC garbage spit out by current and previous administrations rather than an insightful or accurrate understanding of the situation. She also seems to be distracted at times by defending the actions or positions of previous administrations, rather than pushing forward with the purported goals of the book.Overall, I found the book to be a good review of history and a primer for the topic of religion's role in foreign policy and diplomacy, but largely lacking in the clear vision and lack of partisanship needed to actually get anywhere."
4,very good!,"if you are into religion and how it effects world politics and affairs, a must read. very enlightening. if you could care less about that, then it is long and boring."
5,Very cute and cool!!!!!!!,"I got this last month and it is cool! It has cushions on the inside to protect your DS. The screen wipe is cool but I have a way of cleaning it! The keychain part (where the bone is) is a great place to throw your room keys or somthing. With that part if you have a coin purse with a keychain on it you can snap that on the case and put somthing inside it like the charger, extra stylses, more games or anything else! You can put some games inside your DS for some game storage! There is somthing else that is cool about the case! On the back of this there is a belt loop so you can carry it on your hand and your belt!So what are you waiting for? If you have a DS buy it now! Not a waste of money! It's awsome!"
5,Great Case for your Nintendog Lovers,It's cute and it does the job!!! My 9 yr old absolutely loves it!!!!!
2,fading,"Calypso Basics 5 Quart powder coated Colander, Lemoncan't be put in the dish washer or all the coating comes right off - and the color fades rather quickly so probably best to save your money here"
4,Worthwhile,"This is not the world's best walking stick, nor is it a tripod, nor is it a blunt weapon. However, ours lives in the car, and has served all three purposes quite well. If we're heading on a hike, and feel we might need to either have a little extra traction, or take some zoom or low light photos, or keep some ""Oh he's just growling"" off-leash dog away from our ankles, this is a great solution. If it were sturdier, it would be heavier. The only reason for 4 stars is I think it could be a little cheaper - but then again I have no QC issues, so maybe it's worth it."
4,Gave as a gift,I gave this as a gift and my sister was pleased. It is her first unipod. She will be using it for a photography course through a local camera shop.
2,Not what I thought it would be,"The dog is really good looking, and looks realistic. The only problem is that, it isn't really a stuffed animal. The head is really hard, its filled with a hard substance. The legs are rods in them. The body is really firm. The Basset Hound resembles more of a real, dog that was stuffed, as compared to an actual stuffed animal that a child could cuddle and play with. It is a little to realistic for my tastes, or the person I bought it for. They were really creeped out by the dog."
3,Too tall for my car,"This jack was inexpensive and easy to use. It says it's designed to lift the car up, but not hold the car up for extended periods. I think it's talking about people who'll use it to change their oil - I never had any problem with it.Unfortunately, this jack's lowest setting was too high to get under the support beam. This meant I had to use the annoying jack that came with the car to lift it up, then transfer the weight to this jack so I could easily change a flat. Next time I'm going to check the clearance and the lowest setting for the jack. (This one seems to be 5.25"" - I assume it isn't 525"")"
5,Masterpiece,This is an absolute masterpiece - virtuoso performances from all concerned - Cuban Bluegrass my fave - still stands up after 30 years. Can't recommend highly enough.
3,Not like I'd remembered,"I am a Steve Stills fan as well as CSN&Y.; These days I'm going back and buying CDs of many of the old LPs I used to have.I was surprised when I got this one that it was not as good as I had remembered. It's still Steve Stills and has a quality about it just because of that, but it seemed like this was a collection of the non-hits.The other surprise was that the harmonies weren't very good. After CSN&Y;, you'd think that would be a given.So while it's not a bad recording, if I had it to do over again, I probably would have spent my money elsewhere."
3,Monassas/Stephen Stills,"I've always been a fan of CSNY and many of their individual works. Manassas with Stepen Stills was all right, but it lacked something.I dig it out once and awhile and listen to it, but it's not one of my favorites for this group of guys."
1,Poor Quality Insert,The CD sounds OK. The insert quality is awful and there is no listing of songwriter credits. It is not worth the money overall.
3,looks counterfeit from a 3rd world country,"Shipment took longer than expected. That it cam from a country using the cyrillic alphabet with a currency I do not recognize may have contirbuted to the delay.Graphics on the picture on the CD were poor and the quality of the ""digitally remastered sound from the orignal master tapes"" is not as good as my old vinyl.Nonetheless it is now part of my digital collection."
4,..Stills fully realized..,"...the guy captured lighting in a bottle on this record. 'Johnny's Garden,' is probably the best song the man's ever written. perfect road-trip cd"
5,A True Classic,"This album is Stephen Stills at his best. It is a great mix of different styles, even to the point where the album seems somewhat fragemented. There is a hearty display of the blues, country, bluegrass, and a Latin American touch. The countryish elements are nicely blended with the Latin American slant that is so often present in Stills' music. His time in Panama truly had influence on his music. The album shows a great deal of emotion and is great musically. I think the best song on this album is ""Jonny's Garden""."
5,The Classic,"I have had this piece of music since it came out and in every form it has been produced in...it is ""the classic"" for its time and maybe for a long time....I play music constantly when I'm home and I have a 300 disc player...needless to say when you put it on shuffle some diversity comes out of the speakers....It is such a rush when somebody that has never heard this music, does hear it for the first time it is always the same ""jeez who is this"" ""I need to have this"" or ""can you play me the whole albumn""....if you don't own this your music collection is incomplete...just saying...Regards"
4,an extremely satisfying album.,"early 70's country/folk/rock is anathema to some, i understand. but i don't know why this is so. what's wrong with beautiful songwriting and song execution? this is an extremely satisfying album for the ears. a wide range of moods and textures are covered over the course of the recording without a false step along the way. i highly recommend this for all fans of country-rock."
3,Is it available in Spanish?,"Does it have subtitles in spanish? I would like to know what languages are available, does anyone know? ? ? ? ?"
2,Hold down strap incorrectly installed,"While the leather in this holster is nice, and the workmanship is good, the left handed holster I ordered from Optics Planet was not correctly assembled. The snap is on the INSIDE of the holster, next to your body, where is is difficult, if not impossible, to unsnap it quickly. Optics Planet could not understand the problem, and would not send me prepaid mailing labels. Will never deal with them again.Be ware, or maybe I just got one that was incorrect, and the others are ok."
5,On eof the greatest,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. It's certainly my favorite Duvall movie. James Earl Jone is great; the whole cast is wonderful. It should have won all kinds of awards. I stumbled upon it accidentally, and was pleasantly surprised."
4,"Enjoyable, thought-provoking","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie about the importance of family, even when one finds it in the most unlikely of places. Both James Earl Jones & Robert Duvall are excellent, as usual, but Irma P. Hall nearly steals every scene she appears in. Well worth watching."
3,Good key rings - some too stiff or too loose,I was looking for key rings which would open and close easily to allow my students to add whole punched cue cards to a series of concept cards which we write throughout the year. They keep these cards alphabetically organized so this was the perfect mechanism as they could open the ring anywhere in the series of cards. Overall the rings are ok. There are a bunch which are too stiff for what I need them for - some of them don't open at all. Others are so loose that they don't stay shut. I would say about 60% of them are just right.
5,Just what I needed,"I bought these, believe it or not, to put on the bottom of music recorders (instruments) for a black belt system. The kids tie the yarn to the ring for each ""belt"" they earn. It is perfect for what we use it for!"
3,Hard to open,the first ring I took out opened and closed with relative ease but the rest hurt my fingers. They look great though but don't over-stuff them because you might rip the paper if you try to reopen it.
4,Not as strong as his best work,"This is an enjoyable album, and it has some really good, pure melodic pop on it. But I have a few complaints:1. The songs just aren't quite as catchy as previous work. I find myself programming my CD player around some of them.2. Matthew fired his lead and rhythm guitarists, and came out worse for it. Hey Matt, those guys were awesome; how come you got rid of them?3. The album is too short. It's not even 40 minutes.Despite these shortcomings, it's still a fun, if somewhat cynical, collection of songs."
3,not as bad as I first thought,"yeah there's no lead guitar.yeah it was recorded on the Wallensac at 3 3/4 ips, BUT on the other side the songs are more UPBEAT and less embittered and cynical than earlier albums.Matt, buddy, is there a better version of this album over at your house, with the lead guitar tracks still in, as it was originally recorded before you had the fight with Ivan?"
3,Bad production and no lead guitar Mars good Matt Sweet songs,"Matthew Sweet's ""Girlfriend"" was one of the 5 best albums of the 90's, not only great songs but great recording. ""Blue Sky on Mars"" is quite disappointing in comparison.These songs would be good with a lead guitar (there is none, only Matthew playing rhythm). The sound is fuzzy, sounds like it was recorded in Matthew's basement with an old Wallensak tape recorder. Sounds like a fuzzy wet blanket was put over the soundstage.It's a shame too, Matthew could re-record the same album with a lead Guitarist and quality production and engineering and the catchy tunes herein would be a hit!!Matthew continues to fall from the pinnacle of ""Girlfriend""."
1,Boring,"It really is, a boring album. I only have Altered Beast and Girlfriend, and they are such good albums. I can't listen to this album. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
2,Sickeningly Sweet,"Despite one or two great songs on this c.d., most are really mediocre. They are not very original or memorable. I found that after listening to the cd once or twice, it began nauseating me. i got rid of it within two weeks."
4,Everyday Use,These are my primary glasses and they get used alot. I have only had one break in the last 6 months due to personal error. I have dropped them on tile floors with no problems. They wash well and I have had no problems with chipping around the rim.
5,A classic.,"The book by Shannon and Weaver (1949) is the classic; Shannon almost *is* information theory. There is more to it: The present lovely little book appeared first in 1965, but is still very relevant. I think it is a good next book to read. At least the mathematical part of the subject stays more constant over the years, as do the fundamental principles;-- that is what Ash's book is about. I especially liked ch 4 on error correcting codes, and the mathematical appendix which is centered around the Karhunen-Loeve theorem;-- the latter having found recent exciting applications in wavelet theory."
3,on seeing the wood for the trees,"My interest in information theory comes from general physics and philosophy. Ash`s book is doubtless excellent for a communications specialist. What I had hoped for, for example, was something enlightening about the relation between thermodynamic entropy and communication entropy with an explanantion of the position of Boltzmann`s constant betweren the two. Thermal noise according to the Nyquist formula might provide a link. But Nyquist doesn`t get a mention.In short the book was not what I needed. Probably not the author`s fault but if you are not already, or not anxious to be a dedicated communication specialist then beware."
1,Fragile brittle handle with care,"Really pretty, simply not practical, two handles cracked on two of the four trays without careless handling. I do not recommend the item."
3,The Flying Dutchman,"This is a story about a sailor named George, he spots a ship coming towards them. It was coming in to fast, then it disappeared. The ship is a ghost ship but why,why does the ship wander the seas, never stopping."
3,inexpensive dremel clone - did the job fine,"I bought this item to remove grout in my shower ... I bought it with the dremel grout removal bitDremel 570 1/8-Inch Carbide Grout Removal BitThe shower grout, was not the pasty white stuff - this was tough concrete, and the bit and the tool slowly did their work and the job was completed. Holding the bit at a 45 degree angle away from the direction that one is pulling (effectively making it ""downhill"" from the direction of force) was key.I will say that this tool's quality was alright, not great. I didn't expect great for the price. As another reviewer stated, this may be the same manufacturer as Dremel - I don't know. By the time my job was complete however, the tool couldn't grip the bit tightly- it would loosen after just a bit of pressure. That's why my review is for only 3 stars.I am happy with the purchase, as I wanted this tool for a specific task, not to last a lifetime. The price was just right."
1,Flirting with Boredom,"The title should be renamed Flirting with Forty (that looks like 60). Heather looks great for someone who got a lot of plastic surgery that went awry. If she was able to act, then this movie might have been somewhat enjoyable. Not good..."
1,"WARNING - ""GIVE IT UP"" is not the live version!!!","Please preview the songs before purchasing. I did a one click download of the entire ""Blow You're Face Out"" album and it includes only the studio version of ""Give It To Me."" I am not sure if this an Amazon issue or done intentionally by Rhino. I can't find the live version on Amazon.Other than that this is good stuff. As one reviewer indicated a few of the songs do get tedious and it's not as good as ""Full House"" but I would still recommend it."
2,Low energy.,"Being a huge fan of J. Geils' ""Full House,"" I was encouraged by some reviews here to believe that ""Blow Your Face Out"" was a similar live effort. But the only similarity is that they were both recorded live. ""Blow Your Face Out"" is funky and laid back. Not bad, if that's what you want. But anyone expecting something along the lines of Full House will be tremendously disappointed. In fact, ""Lookin' For Love,"" which will knock your socks off on ""Full House,"" is done as a slow, elavator Muzac tune in ""Blow Your Face Out."" Why did they even bother?The energy level, which is consistently frenzied on Full House, rarely gets above ""low"" on ""Blow Your Face Out."" After listening to it twice, I realized there is no song on it that I want to hear again. Not that aren't a couple good songs on it. There just are no high energy songs other than House Party. I wasted my money."
5,Gotta Love Live,"I am a child of the 60's and 70's. I have seen The J. Geils Band in concert many times and they always, always put on a great show with tons of energy. I also over the years have purchased many cassette tapes and Cd's of their studio work, and while those are all great tunes there just isn't anything to compare with the raw, extended, and in your face Live tunes. I am enjoying this copulation of songs a lot and if you like J. Geils, you will definitely love this."
4,Terrific live performance from one of my favorite bands,"Being a teenager in the late 60s and early 70s growing up in Boston, I got to see the J Geils Band perform many times. I loved the music, the beat, the energy that this band cranked out. In high school, the band's live album ""Full House"" was my favorite record. I played it hundreds, if not thousands of times. In my mind, Full House is one of the best live albums ever.I was delighted to see this mp3 album offered at Amazon. Blow Your Face Out was recorded in 1975. I was fortunate to catch the band on several stops on the tour, each time the concert was classic. This album captures all the things that made me a JGeils fan.I give this record 4 stars. It is a great album, but Full House remains my favorite live album. This one's not too far behind."
3,A decent album from the Juke Joint Jimmy crew.,"Although this album captures some of the live atmosphere of a J. Geils show, it doesn't quite measure up the energy of their Full House live album. I bought this album with the hopes that it would be as much fun as Full House, but it comes up a little short. I still come down on the side of the fence that says ""buy it""..I mean, afterall, it IS the J. Geils Band."
3,Not sure it's age appropriate,"While this book does deal with the topic in a delicate, Christian matter; I was disappointed that for 6-8 year olds, it did not address body changes. Also the book is too long for a 6 year old. I think the whole conversation In Mother's Workroom is too much for this age and would be better for a 9-12 year old."
3,OK but...,The Film has nothing to say about the mysterious disapperiance of the maya's. thats what i want to hear about.
4,Mystery of the Maya appropriate,"I ordered this DVD for my gifted and talented students in middle school. Since we are studying the Maya, this video was totally appropriate for their viewing. The content was presented in a manner that interested them with a young student working with an older teacher type person/archaeologist. I would highly recommend it for grades 6 and on up."
2,Disappointing IMAX title,"I have watched many of the IMAX films that have been released on DVD. This one stands out as one of the most disappointing ones I have seen. I actually fell asleep watching it - and I wasn't particularly tired. The film starts out with a great flyover of the coastline with a Mayan temple. After that it quickly loses that special IMAX expectation of panoramic shots and ""grandness.""I found the storyline quite tiring and merely a distraction to what was being taught. While educational, if the focus on close ups and limited camera visual scope is what the authors wanted to get across then standard video footage would have been enough. The dilution of the IMAX expectation knocked off at least 2 stars."
4,Being fair,"This documentary is below the image IMAX standard, don't buy it if what you want is to see spectacular landscapes shots, but if what you want is a good introductory documentary about the Maya, pick up this one, you are not going to be disappointed. In a glimpse you can get a good quantity of information about this amazing people."
3,Would Make a Great Roadmap for a Trip,"But the information was pretty outdated in a lot of cases. Even though the book was published in 1995, the information seems to be cut off in the late 1970s.What I'd like to know about ghost books by Holzer is why every haunted house always turns out to have a whole bunch of ghosts once the psychics get involved. It really shakes my ability to suspend disbelief. But I suppose that's the whole nature of Holzer's books-- they're so chatty and credulous he comes out sort of as the Arch Merrill of ghost books."
4,a change in rap,"This albulm has some pretty good songs. Especially numbers 2,3,5, and 14. Even though he raps about god it still has a gansta feel to it. Highly recomended if you are looking for tight beats,lyrics and a new flavor in the many candies of rap."
3,Not very practical,"Generally this is a good book. It covers some algorithm to the depth. But many topics it covers are not useful to game development, which I am interested. It does not cover some important animation related topics like vertex blending."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"BUYER BEWARE!!! I never received half of my order, and my entire order were gifts for people, and the half that I did receive took over 2 weeks to arrive. I had to call the seller several times. The 1st time the said they were reshipping it & again it never appeared. The 2nd time, I was asked to leave my phone # & then was never called back! I was finally sent an email stating a refund was to be given, but I was never called back & explained why. This has taken well over a month, which is totally ridiculous in my book!!! These people are awful!!!"
5,very informative,"As a Seventh day Adventist Christian, I was pleased to be able to read Wm. Miller's original lectures. It is interesting to read the thoughts of the man who arrived at the dates for the prophecies in Daniel, and started such a great movement to prepare people for the soon coming of Jesus."
1,Looks better than it works,"Sure looks nice, but looks can be deceiving! I bought this for work I have had it for two days and will be returning it tomorrow. I had to stand there and feed page by page or otherwise it would jam up. I got 2 faxes to go through that way and now the ink film is out. I would need to purchase a new one for $25. At that cost I am better off going down the steet and have the copy place do it for less! I am greatly disappionted in this unit and would urge anyone to NOT buy it!"
3,Great plain paper fax - not thrilled with the film required,"I bought this fax machine to do business from home when needed. I was surprised to find the fax film needed for incoming faxes ran out so quick. It must have been less than 40 pages of fax and then my film ran out. Bummer. The phone works fine unless you're talking next to a running microwave. Otherwise, great fax."
5,Soap Zone,"This is a 3 tracks cd single.Although I think the first single should have been 'Fetch' this is still an underated song.At first I didn't warm on to Sweet 75, now I love them!The song 'SOAP ZONE' is previously unreleased and as some people say it's their favorite Sweet 75 song which is weird since it's a B-Side.Still, great single!Krist Novoselic is the best!"
1,Terrible...,"I love Acqua Di Gio, so I thought ""A body spray! How great is this!"" It turned out to be a complete waste of money. I pulled off the cap, gave it a spray, and had to run to the shower to wash it off. It doesn't ""accent"" the cologne at all. It just smells...bad. You would be better of picking up some AXE at your local grocery store."
1,Wrong item,"Please be careful on the item you order, he I am thinking Im getting the cologne and then they send me Deodorant Spray instead. But wait, heres the kicker, NOT REFUNDABLE-hazardous material!"
4,Good Resource Book,"I have not had a chance to read this book as yet, but it came well recommended for checking arrival records in the United States. I have several puzzles of this type awaiting me."
1,Not for the professional,This knife is good for the one time do-it-yourselfersfor finishing a basement however for the 20 year or betterdrywall finisher there are products that are better suited.More light-weight knives that offer better handling for thefull time everyday drywall person.
2,Not on iTunes,The reason I bought this CD was because I could not get the only song I wanted (Cha-Cha-Cha In Blue) on iTunes. This song was a hit in the 60s and I was happy to be able to get a perfect copy of the song. But this CD like most has one or two good songs and the rest are just OK. Nothing against Junior Wells. He is a great blues artist who has been around forever. I hope the CD sells well but the cost of CDs is too high for just one or two good songs. Thank God for iTunes.
2,Quality of Video Reproduction is Horrific,"I am playing ""His Girl Friday"" now on a very high end DVD player, and the quality of the image is horrific. It is much lower resolution than the original film. The contrast is much too high. The sound quality is poor. This looks and plays like a cheap Chinese copy of a low quality source."
5,Who doesn't like Cary?,Cary Grant is hands-down one of our best actors and it's good to have a collection of his movies in my collection. I might even do a Cary Grant film festival one of these weekends when the snow is piling up outside and I have warm popcorn and cold beer to see me through.
5,One of the best yet...,"I have read and own almost all Carolyn Davidson's books. This book, although released as a 'Harlequin Historical', is a cut above the rest. Now, lets get to Faith's story and I think putting her with Sherrif Caulfield would be great!!"
4,Motel of the Mysteries,Great and interesting book for adolescents! I would highly recommend this book because it will keep you on the edge of your seats.
1,Dumbest book I've ever read,"I had to get this for a class, but I recommend that you bypass it if possible. It's a futuristic book with drawings about how a man uncovers today's world which has been covered over with petrified junk mail debris. He tries to figure out what today's objects were used for. Boring and pointless."
4,Interesting parody,"This is a very short book. I would imagine it is supposed to be geared to a younger audience. It involves the interpretations of 41st century archeologist in excavating a Motel 6 type roadside Motel. The excavation begins as satire of the opening of King Tut's tomb, and also has a send up of Schleiman's discovery of Troy. There are many amusing scenes were common objects are interpreted as religious artifacts.It reminds us that our knowledge of the past is always through the filter of the present, and therefore may not be as acurate as we think it is."
5,"this book is a ""scream!""","When this book first was published, the Hotel Technology department head inadvertently had the college library purchase this book for the department. When it arrived we laughed hysterically about it, and many times, I have laughed about it ever since.Two years ago, I ordered a copy for the library where I am currently a Children's Librarian. It did not even make it to the ""stacks"", someoneliked it so much they ""permanently borrowed"" it.If you need a good laugh...!"
5,Great buy!,"I had this book as a child and was totally in love with it but it was damaged after water seeped into our house after a storm. For the longest time we would look for it at bookstores and other places but could never find another copy.Well, I finally have my new copy, and I'm so pleased.This satirical look at history is like nothing else. Fabulous!"
4,Quick read.,Book was packaged and shipped great. Would have been nice if description had stated first half of book was almost completely underlined. Still good value.
5,Motel of Mis-interpretation,This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. It is an object lesson in leaping to conclusions.
1,Did any part of a tree have to die so that this rubbish could be printed?,Preston you pompous turd. I can't believe you force your students to buy your thesis. Isn't simply having you lecture torture enough? Sadistic bastard.
2,Not sure what's going on here,"I am building a set of Shun Elite knives; I previously owned Wustofs, and decided to go with Shun for the ""next step"". These knives are INCREDIBLY expensive, and I'm not sure how I feel about them, as this slicer showed up with the tip broken off. I couldn't find the tip anywhere, so I'm not sure when or where it disappeared. It was an ever-so-tiny chip; not like a huge chunk of the knife blade came off. These knife blades are very thin, relative to competitive products. My Santoku knife has a ding in the blade and a bent tip, just from regular usage. The good news is that Shun will repair or replace any knife for the life of them after purchase, so I'll be taking advantage of this.If you're hard on knives, save your money and spend less on Henckel or Wustof knives; the blades are thicker, heavier, and will withstand more punishment. Shuns are very delicate, and require a master's touch. They are SHARP, though!!!"
3,Started System,"Great set for a beginier, it worked fine by me. But, once we introduced another Nady system, it didn't work... not sure why"
1,Just didn't work,"I was hopeful to have somewhat usable sound out of this but it just doesn't work at all. I also tried performing the ""fix"" mentioned by another reviewer but it did nothing. You can only hear very loud fuzz and the most quiet audio. I'm not sure why this product was made or is being sold. It seems so defective."
4,Nady EO3AA Wireless In-ear,"This is a great little item for the price. I had to tweak it a little by removing the cover of the transmitter and turning the small tripod to the 3 o'clock position which increased the volume. There is a hiss, but once the music starts you can't hear it. I bought a better ear phone set at Target that has the ear loop that goes over and behind you ear. Can't go wrong for $150."
3,Thickness of bath mats,Please include the thickness of all bath mats. You cannot rate an item if you do not have the all of the information about the product. Thank you.
3,Good ideas but too repetitive and abstract,"This book is written in a question and answer format. A number of Christian parents and/or educators are interviewed regarding how to raise responsible, Christian teens. I was quite disappointed. First of all, very little concrete advice is offered. Ideas and abstractions seem to permeate the whole book. Secondly, it's highly repetitive and rather unfocused in its scope. Although you're bound to pick up some good ideas here and there, the book would have been more effective if it had been condensed. Many of the interviewees say exactly the same thing in different words and in different chapters. Thirdly, despite the title, very little is said about what, specifically, to do when your child is still a toddler! Most of the interviewees talk about what they do or did when their children were in their teens. Overall, I'd say borrow this book from the library, but save your book dollars for a meatier volume (like maybe one of J. Dobson's books)."
3,small set but as described,"there was nothing per-say wrong with this product, but pay attention to the quantities before ordering. I wanted to hang a whole bunch of pictures, and I was out of the pieces I needed really quickly with this kit. I realized afterwards that i would have been better off buying a more expensive kit with more in it--theres not much wire at all, for example. i think this is a good product if you just have a few pictures 2 hang as a little starter set, but if you are trying to do a lot u might want to upsize a bit."
3,Tiny little pieces,"This hanger kit came with everything, but the pieces were tiny and not very useful tbh. I guess I should have expected as much but regardless it was all there, the shipping was fine, and it came quick from the seller so you can't argue with that."
3,"Okay product, poor MarketPlace reseller","I'm somewhat content with the product itself, as it helped control many of the weeds in my yard, and seems to have helped the grass itself a bit as well. I don't think the product works quite as well as they'd like you to believe, since there were quite a number and variety of weeds that were not controlled by the Turf Builder (used according to directions), and I usually get much better results using a dedicated fertilizer and a dedicated weed killer in separate applications. So much for the lazy way :)The seller (acehardwareoutlet), however, I am quite unhappy with. I've never experienced slower shipping from an online retailer. I've recently had things shipped from Japan to the US for about the same price, and that took half of the time. Customer support was unresponsive and unhelpful, and the promised refund of the shipping price (because the item arrived after the promised 'latest' date) has not been fulfilled."
2,Why Do All These Reviews Sound The Same?,"Isn't anyone here even slightly critical of Jason Robert Brown's oeuvre? How about a collection of bloated, cliche ridden songs? Jason Robert Brown uses his highly derivative piano technique and a set of technical difficulties for vocalists that fool some listeners and performers into thinking this is an art music. If like me, you have to learn some of his songs as an accompanist, don't buy this book. No singer I've ever met wants to audition with selections from ""Urban Cowboy"", the most miserable failure Broadway has known in the last 10 years."
3,Early Pink Film,"This is an early example of pink film from Japan. It's not as explicit as roman porno films of the 1970s; however, it has charm. There are some nice artsy cinematic moments during love scenes, closeups of the body, sweat, lakes and some posturing. Where the film falters is the pretty weak dialog, the character who plays the maid (who is pretty inconsequential to the story), and the poorly remastered print. The 35mm print has a lot of blemishes and the original subtitles are used (white on the print itself). If you are familiar with some of the Something Weird re-issues of black and white art house films, you may like this. If you are expecting an all out exploitation flick, you may be disappointed."
3,"Plausable, Terrible Exploitation of a widow's circumstances","Altogether plausable situation in which a recent widow is approached by her late husband's major creditor with an offer to exchange indebtedness for sex. Women apparently bore some kind of legal responsibility for their husbands debts, which is terrible. Although it sounds outrageous I suspect that things like this happen all the time, even here in the United States. There is some pretty tame sex in the movie, not quite up to an R rating. I found myself feeling sorry for the woman. On the other hand she did not seem to be entirely rejecting the arrangement, either. If he would have married her I think she would have gone along, but no such luck. He plans to marry someone else but keep her around for sex. Bad ending. This was apparently the kind of movie that excited Japanese in the 1960's. Damned if I can see why. Other than the novelty of a different culture and customs, I wasn't too impressed."
3,Old black & white movie,"The first thing that jumped out to me about this movie is that it's an old black & white movie, if I had known that ahead of time, I would never have purchased this movie. If you are looking for something racey and like watching nude asian women, then this isn't the movie for you. If this movie were to be released today it would probably be rated PG. If you like old movies (like movies with Humphry Bogart) then this might be the movie for you."
3,Solid Live Album,"Yesshows is the second live album from Yes and it is a solid effort. The album's strongest songs are from the Going For The One album including the title track, a rousing ""Wondrous Stories"" and ""Parallels"". The best track is the great ""Don't Kill The Whale"". The album drags on the poor ""Time & A Word"" and an overblown ""Gates Of Delirium"". The band sounds fine, but the album doesn't have the power of their first live album Yessongs."
5,OK OK OK I changed my mind!,"See my other review after I just got the CD- I wasn't really impressed - NOW after repeated listinings I love it all !!! My apologies to YES - The fact that this is a cheap CD makes it a bargain. And Jon Andersons little dialog between ""Dont Kill The Whales"" and ""Ritual"" is worth the price by itself. It is a ""soul"" show - and to those who say Steve Howe makes a mistake at the beginning of ""Going for the One"" check our Symphonic YES version of the same song, he does it the same way-its no mistake, just the way he does it!"
4,Great live album from Yes,"Gates of Delirium is simply amazing. Ritual is too long...the parts that have been added just make shadow on a great Yes epic.I prefer ""Time and a word"" and ""Going for the one"" on Keys to ascension""""Parallels"", ""Don't kill the whale"" and ""Wonderous stories"" are good.Even if the remaster is better than the original, the sound quality is light years away from ""Keys to Ascension 1 & 2""To me, this album worth its price just for the version of ""Gates of Delirium"""
3,A Live Album Which Spots I Like (And Spots I Don't Like),"I like the way Yes jams along with Stravinsky's ""The Firebird Suite"" before opening the show with ""Parallels"" (one of Chris Squire's finest songs ever). Patrick Moaz does a great job on ""The Gates of Delirium"" and even on ""Ritual"". However, this version of ""Ritual"" is too long and Jon Anderson's tribal noises over Alan White's cymbal-bashing are plenty annoying! You wish Alan would be allowed to solo unadulterated. ""Wonderous Stories"" and ""Going for the One"" hold up well. ""Don't Kill The Whale"" shows Anderson at his most politically correct, but Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe both add a new dimension to an early standard ""Time & a Word""."
3,from a 35yr concrete finisher,"goldblatt makes very good tools,but they are a lot heavier then marshaltown. myself I perfer a good marshaltown!"
2,Table Topr Tripod,"Velbon Dual Function Mini Photographic/Video TripodA very well designed and constructed table tripod however the item sent bears no relationship to the picture on Amazon. The tripod shown is a model NOT IMPORTED to USA. The item shipped is the same size but will not permit a wide spread of the tripod legs as shown in the picture, making it too upright and unstable for the purpose for which I order it - a mount for a heavy spotting scope. Much as I liked it, I had to return it. The delivered product was a good quality tripod, but it is a different model that the one shown in the picture on Amazon."
1,Deceptive Picture,"When I saw the product, it looks, based on the add, that four rulers would be shipped for the one price. However, I only received one ruler, not four. I returned the product back for a refund."
4,"Hard to Find Good 6"" Rulers These Days","I'm giving this 4 stars (relatively) because it is so difficult to find 6"" rulers these days. I've gone through several of these. They're OK and work decently for my purposes but there is a weak spot in the middle. After a while, every single one of these rulers I've used would crack down the middle line (length-wise) where the plastic is thinner. Very annoying becuase the rulers then feel a lot more flimsy than they feel already. And usually I'll play with it until it breaks all-together. Until I find something better, this is still a 4 star item in my eyes because for the price, they do provide me a lot of service."
2,OK product.,It's a ruler. No big deal. It works. It came In a box big enough to hold a pair of women's boots. Really. What a waste. Let's rethink packaging here.
5,A Must Have!,"This work was suggested to me by my seminary Greek professor after going through a basic textbook. His reasoning was that in class we learned all of the words that appeared at least fifty times in the New Testement and Kubo's lexicon gives a simple definition of the words that do not appear fifty times. Simply open your Greek New Testament and this book to the corresponding chapter and verse and you are set to read. This has cut my reading time in half! Besides UBS Greek New Testament and the BDAG Lexicon, this is the most important book for a biblical Greek scholar's library!"
3,A decent though dated work,"Following in the footsteps of its Hebrew sibling, this work provides simple definitions for words of low occurance in the Greek New Testament. The problems for this title lie in its definitions (just as with its companion), as they often reflect a simple, overly wooden meaning for the Greek term which are often not helpful or even the correct meaning for the particular lexime in context. Also, some of the definitions offered are archaic, only further confusing the student. Better would be to purchase Metzger's treatment of NT vocab, learning down to 20 or so occurences, then using the dictionary in the back of the UBS text for those rarely occuring words."
4,wonderful resource,a must-have for anyone who enjoys studying the Bible to uncover deeper meaning within the Scriptures. Great companion to the Hebrew Lexicon and any Strong's concordance.
4,Cost-benefit analysis on a macro-econical level,"I used this book to learn more about cost-benefit decisions in tranportation planning, and albeit the book does not relate specifically to that field, it worked very well. The nice part is that it first discusses some macro-economical concepts before delving into cost-benefit calculations. This is very useful if you, like me, do not have a background, classes, courses or a degree in economics. As an introductory book on an undergraduate level this book is excellent."
4,A Bit Too Heavy,"Good Design, but can't put notebook vertically in the compartment. Weight is 6.1lb, adding the notebook 7.5lb + ac adapter etc, it's quite heavy to carry around. Otherwise, it's a good notebook case in other sense."
4,It's about time,"As a long time fan of both The Road and the TV show, I have been waiting for the release of Route 66 episodes and I hope that more episodes are to be released in the future. The selection of stories for this DVD was based on the actors who were guest stars and provided an extra interest."
3,For those who take BIG bites,"Fellow enlightened beings. My love for Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi exceeds words but I did not find this dialogue to be all that useful. Granted if you are in an advanced state you can intuit many of this dialogue and benefit. However compared to the other presentations of this mystic Saint are concerned I resonate with others. Consider Guru Vachaka Kovai, I am absorbing this at the moment. Your true nature is existence, with love, Paul."
5,One of the Best,"A very moving film, so much so that it's hard to simply define it as a comedy. In a way, it makes me think of ""Stand By Me."" In the same manner that the boys are off, hiking down the tracks, looking for the body but also for themselves, the guys in ""City Slickers"" are looking for something hard to find. They are all really looking for Mitch's smile and find, again, why they are such great friends. I always feel so much better about myself after watching this film."
2,Hasn't worn well,"I remembered this movie as very funny the first time around. However, on a recent second viewing, the characters (apart from Jack Palance's Curley who was funny and memorable) were annoying, the jokes fell flat and I couldn't sit through the whole thing."
4,"This is a mans movie not unlike ""Passages""","Three friens, all men, who grew up together and who apparently, vacation as adults,(without female friends or wives) go on a vacation to a dude ranch where you actually learn to drive a herd of cows across country-with the help of a drunken cook, two misfit trail hands and an aging Jack Palance who who is full of ""street"" wisdom,albeit ""country. The three friends all seem to have ""skeletons in their own closets but somehow this comedy which clearly invokes memories of any young boy from the NY area . Who cannot remember walking through the tunnel in Yankee Stadium and seeing the green grass and the Mick hit one out. All three friends grow along the way and make us laugh and cry sometimes at the same time. One of Billy Crystals best."
4,A rootin' tootin' good time.,"I loved this movie when it first came out. The characters are lovable and story is fun. Billy Crystal has the best lines in the movie and gets to show off some of his standup talent during the classroom scene. A young Jake Gyllenhaal plays his son. The only reason I didn't give this one 5 stars is that the language and adult themes get in the way of what could be a perfect family movie. Here's some advice...Watch this before showing it to your kids and memorize where all of the sex talk and foul language is so you can hit the mute button when necessary. If you can master that, you can share a great movie with them and they will love it although you'll have to explain why 1/3 of the movie is muted out."
5,"Great Film, Crystal is a genius","This movie, in it's essence, is a comedy. Throughout the film, there are serious moments between the trio of Mitch, Phil and Ed (Crystal, Stern and Kirby) that transcend the typical comedy genre. There is a small feeling that you're being set up in the beginning of the film, but the ride that these characters go through change their lives and you will definitely be happy you saw this film."
5,"Still funny, even for today's teens!","Watched ""City Slickers"" with my two children: 17-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son. Wasn't sure it would be as funny as I remembered when I saw it when it was released originally. I asked them to watch it for 30 minutes and we could turn it off if they weren't enjoying it. Well, we watched the whole thing and it was as great, if not better, as I remember. My children loved it! My daughter fell in love with Norman, and my son wants to go on a cattle drive.As we watched the movie, I kept saying to my kids that the actor playing Billy Crystal's son looked like a young Jake Gyllenhaal. Imagine my surprise to see in the credits that it was, indeed, a very young Jake. (Yee hah!! I love being right in front of my kids once in a while.)This film is probably not appropriate for young children as there is crude sexual language, some swear words, and the birth of a calf grossed my kids out. I'm not sure if it was real or not but you see it all."
4,"You Know, I Never Moseyed Before?","You can't not like this movie. Billy Crystal plays such an adorable character, a complacent man turning 40 who gets talked into a crazy birthday adventure with his two best friends. Jack Palance does what he does best; he plays the intimidating roughneck whose hard edges are at times comical.This movie is a good gift for anyone who enjoys a good comedy. The characters seem very genuine, and the plot makes you long for a trip out west."
3,Billy Crystal vehicle gives you a full dose of Crystal,"A fish out of water comedy that makes more than the usual overtures towards character development, this movie depicts Billy Crystal and his two friends embarking on a real western cattle drive as tourist/participants as they attempt to shake off the emotional drawbacks of hitting middle age. Things go awry when the trail leader dies and a couple of the hired hands turn out to be thieves, absconding in bad circumstances and leaving the tourists to run the cattle by themselves. There are a lot of feel-good moments, and Billy Crystal gets plenty of time to do his schtick, which is good to the extent that you enjoy his schtick."
5,Classic feel good,"Billy Crystal fans may agree with me, this is a classic. Everyone likes to chuckle and this movie delivers. Worth watching more than once."
5,Hijinks on the Happy Trails,Clearly Palance's best work since Gunsmoke. Favorite scene is where Curly gets drunk and suffers a fatal heart attack while attempting to ride a cow.
3,almost perfect..except,"I ordered a full screen version...but I was sent a widescreen version.It was for my mom after I bought her first DVD player.It's one of her 2 favorite movies and I don't have the heart to take it away from her now...she watches it and ""Twister"" at least 2 times a week. She occassionally asks me what the 2 black lines are from. She's 88 years old, God Bless Her."
2,A Definite Slicker,"I ordered this because it was supposed to be the Collector's Edition with Commentary, Featurettes & Deleted scenes. I received it and, while the cover states it is the Collector's Edition with the extras, it is not. So I returned it to Amazon, asking them to replace it, which they did remarkably quickly. Problem is, the replacement is exactly like the first one I received -- no commentary, no featurettes, no deleted scenes although the cover says they are there. So now I am trying to contact someone at MGM or Fox to sort this out. (Having no luck at that but I will continue to try.) I can't blame Amazon for having received mismarked packaging. I love the movie but I bought this as a replacement so I would have the extras and, alas, the extras are not there, so the rating is two stars because the product is not as advertised."
3,Amusing In Parts But Poor DVD Quality!,"Very few comedies age well and this one isn't an exception; some of the jokes are still funny but many have aged poorly and have become lame as a result. The fortunate thing though is that this film is not just an outright comedy but it also has a timeless theme of dealing with mid-life crisis and understanding that ""one thing"" in life that matters.For this reason, this film will still amuse and remain relevant for some years to come. Too bad this dvd version is so poor though as the picture quality was poor on too many frames and there was a glaringly large white spot on the frame where Daniel Stern's character gets discovered for his infidelity. The sound quality isn't the greatest either and so my suggestion is to wait for either a properly restored Blu-ray or standard version which addresses both these picture and sound quality deficiencies to be released and to give this particular dvd version a miss."
4,Male Bonding and Cows have Never Been Funnier!,"Basically a comedy about midlife crisis. But it violently changes direction near the end and becomes a poignant soul-searching journey for everyone involved. The reason it works so well is because of the very funny cast, Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby and Daniel Stern are all very funny in their parts. And Jack Palance steals every scene he's in, to bad he hangs around only for a short while. It has very funny moments, sometimes touching and even poignant near the end, and it's one of the few movies that have a real-life calf being born just for the film. You get the feeling 'City Slickers' tries to be more than just a comedy, and it deserves merit for that. A lot of fun. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!"
2,city slickers,"I am 52 years old and I remembered seeing this movie when it first came out and thought it would be a great movie to watch with my teenage kids. Was I wrong. Nonstop off color humor, sexual innuendos etc..., I guess the target audience is something like 15 - 25 year old males. I actually apologized to my teenage kids and threw the movie away."
3,Above average comedy.,Billy Crystal is looking marvelous in the amusing comedy that is fun to watch. I actually like the sequel just slightly better than the original. Billy crystal is charming and funny and Jack Palance is great.
4,Alonzo,"Alonzo Bodden is a funny, funny man! This is a great DVD that showcases some of his best bitts on stage."
4,It's great,This DVD had previews of comedians I didn't think was so funny but when the actual show started I was laughing and impressed for good funny comedy
2,Just wasn't funny to me,"I like Alonzo and think he is witty and funny; however, this DVD just didn't bring out the funny material I'm used to hearing. I laughed at his clips on youtube...I didn't laugh once while watching this DVD. Save your money and just watch his clips on youtube."
5,You can't go wrong with Alonzo!,Alonzo is one of my favorite comedians. I saw him in concert and he was awesome! This DVD captures his essence!
3,Collectivist SF,"My guess is that Silverberg's intention with this novel was to take the Campbell/Heinlein/Golden Age paradigm of man mastering his environment and turn it on its head. The end, which I won't spoil for you Silverberg fans intent on reading it, strikes this individualist as the most philosophically corrupt ending he has ever read. That said, the book is written with Silverberg's usual intelligence and skill; he brings a hellish world to horrifying life."
2,This one goes back to the second-hand bookstore!,"A pretty forgettable book. Most of the characters are not well-developed, so as various disasters happened on the voyage and characters were killed off one-by-one or in groups I didn't feel too upset as I hardly knew who they were anyway. That 95% of the story is one ill-fated adventure after another gets tedious. The religous aspect of the story is trite and predictable. Likewise the ending was pretty obvious. This is the first novel I've read by Silverberg; I hope his other ones are better. Off to the second-hand bookstore this one is going!"
5,"""Waters"" has strong start & finish, but sinks in middle.","Gripping in Silverberg's usual way because even his heroes are all too human--flawed people doing their best in extreme situations. The books sags a bit in the middle, but features a masterful and mind-blowing conclusion with both metaphysical and religious implications"
2,Solaris in waterworld without the characters knowledge,Were to begin? the story is long but there is really only one character in it and it does not have enougt weight to carry you thru. The end is predictable and unsatisfying.The best part of the book are the monsters encountered during the voyage.Silverberg is quite a prolific writer and I'm sure that there are better books than this one. His short stories are great
5,Animals In The Library!,"I Took My Frog To The Library was an enjoyable book for my second graders last year. So much so, I am ordering my own copy to keep in my class this year and another to raffle off. It's a wonderful book to springboard ideas of what type of pet or animal a child would take on his/her own to the library. It's a great introduction to focus on animal facts and habits because the animals' actions in the libray have to be true to what these animals can really do in their own habitats. I think children of any elementary age would enjoy the thought of being able to bring an animal into the library. What a great book to even start a chat about what the library is like to begin with!"
4,Good set of toy,"I bought the whole set of the toys for more than 2 years, my 4.5-yr old son still plays with the toys because he thinks the toys are cute. My 1.5-yr old son does not pay too much attention to these toys but I bet he will after he can understand the ice age movies."
4,For those who remember,"I have this recording but listen to it rarely due to the addition of the keyboard player. For me it just takes away from the power trio concept that boosted them into fame. Now the price is overboard just like the ""Trapeze Live"" recording and it again shows that money is more powerful than art."
3,Sound Morpher,"I don't know much about this product, but the reviewer: Rob D. from Seattle, Washington appears to be a liar and a stooge for the manufacturer. Writing two identical reviews approximately a year apart, and both claiming to have made the purchase only a few weeks earlier. SOUNDS FISHY"
3,Be careful with this one!!,"My 11 month old received this toy for Christmas this year and LOVES it. However, like most children his age he is teething and sticks everything in his mouth. Well, the paint on the characters is coming off in his mouth. So, we have to watch him very carefully so that he isn't putting the little characters in his mouth. Other than the paint coming off, it's a cute toy. It doesn't do much, but it entertains my son for at least 10 minutes and that's quite an achievement!!"
2,Waste of money for us,"Other than chewing of the little animals, my grandson doesn't play with this toy at all. He's had it for months and still no interest. He has his favorite toys but this isn't one of them. I wish I hadn't spent the money on it. I'm not even sure how a baby is suppose to play with this toy. There is no car to go down the road or bridge or what ever that blue thing is. You can't put the letter in the mail box, there is no place to put it ""in"". You can push it through the large hole in the top, but it's not the shape of the letter, and the mail box doesn't stand up on it's own. You're suppose to put the animals on the center magnet and it will tell you what it is, an owl and a couple others having nothing to do with mail. It's even hard for me to make it work, but it doesn't seem like much fun."
1,Not worth the plastic,"I put this toy on my son's first birthday wish list and it's completely forgettable. It isn't engaging, interesting or fun, and the pieces just lie around - there's no way to conveniently store the pieces when not in use. Don't waste your money. There are so many other great things out there!"
2,Not that entertaining,"This toy seems okay, but my 13 month old son isn't that interested. The music and sounds are also somewhat annoying."
5,A must read - Buy this book now!,"This books that cuts through all the hype and tells it like it is if you are serious about eating healthily. Everything is based on real research and Perry gives you links back to everything so you can verify it yourself. There is no secret formula, quick-fix diet or overnight solution to eating losing weight and eating healthy - the book outlines what you should be doing in a clear, understandable way. I'm eating more than ever and I feel healthier by basically changing my eating habits. I highly recommend you read this book and buy a copy of it for any one you seriously care about."
3,So-So Minogue,"I bought this CD because I had purchsed Neon Nights and was absolutley enthralled with Dannii, I think she is a way better singer than Kylie and her songs were great, so I bought this one to hear some of her older songs. At first I was totally dissapointed. Love and Kisses is very bland and poorly written (don't get me started on that rapping and the awful McDonalds reference!) Then I listened on and began to become fond of Don't Wanna Take this Pain. But that was just the first disc, I'm glad I didn't give up on it and not listen to the second disc because that's where I found the best songs! The Truoser Enthusiast remixes of 'All I Wanna Do' and ""Disrememberance"" are awesome!!! They are clearly the best on the whole collection! 'This is The Way is another good track. If you want to get an idea of her earlier works This is a good place to start. But Neon Nights is her best work to date."
3,"Cool remixes, but some of them ain't club worthy","The first Cd was like remixes from the mid-90's that were suitable to play in clubs back then, but they're okay, though.The second Cd was nice, especially the haunted trance mixes of ""All I Wanna Do"" and ""Disremembrance"". ""Everything I Wanted"" is nice, suitable to play in clubs with the two songs. ""Hallucination"" was alright, too when you're driving in your car, just chill.I gave her 3 stars for the remixes, nicely done, Dannii"
5,Very satisfied with my purchase...,...and with whom I made the purchase with. My book was received promptly and in the condition stated by the seller.
2,Return of the seven could have waited,"The man in black -Chris (Yul Brynner) returns to the mexican village he once saved in the original film. This time he and Vin ( a dull Robert Fuller filling in for Steve Mqueen) form a new 'Seven' in order to rescue the men of the village from the clutches of a mexican bandit bent on building a church as a tribute to his two dead sons. Among the men he captures is Chico of the origianl 7 (Horst Bucholz also chose not to appear in this sequel) rounding out the new Seven are Claud Akins, Warren Oates, Jordan Christoher. The second 'ride for the seven is much darker in tone than the original film and lacks the Panache of the original film (not to mention the cast) no one really cares what happens to this second seven. The film is very uneven with little or no character developement, some of the action sequences are very well done, Return of the Magnificent Seven would stand better as a companion piece to the original film than on the merrits of it's own."
3,Okay Film,"After watching this film I come away saying, an okay film but....not as good a production as the original Magnificent Seven. On a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest and best rating. I rate this a 7."
2,Return of the Seven is Less than Magnificent,"The producers of the Return of the Seven just banked on the name,on Yul Brynner and on Elmer Bernstein's great score and the result is a very dull ,exhausting western. Westerns like these are the ones that hurt the genre. This sequel not only lacks the magnificent cast,plot,character development,but imagination as well. Whoever sees the Magnificent Seven and decides then to watch the Return of the Seven will be saying what Vin (Steve McQueen's character in the original) said at one point in the film:""It seemed like a good idea at the time"". So follow Yul Brynner's advice.""Ride on..."" and see THe Magnificent Seven over and over these seven will never disappoint you ."
1,Boring Boring Boring And More Boring,Can a movie be this dull boring and still be hailed as a masterpiece by some? Wow. Yes it can. This was one of the most irritating movies I have ever seen. Nothing happens. The most mundane things are shown for minutes. No narrative. The balloon has NOTHING to do with the movie. I watched the whole thing thinking that it would get better or something would be explained. Just a bore. Complete and utter bore. Avoid at all costs.
1,Boresville,This is not a remake of the original 1954 french classic. This is an arthouse inspired borefest that I truely wanted to love. Julie B is fantastic in everyfilm i have seen her in. She cannot even save this drawl of a film. This film is more like a day in a life drama with no real conflict that pulls you in. The director utilizes unnecessary long takes that build up to nothing. The red balloon itself is merely a metaphor and appears only in the first scene in the film and with sprinkles of appearances in the body of the film and in the films odd and depressing conclusion. Waste of time. Stay away and buy the digital remaster of The Red Balloon.
2,Can you spell BORING?,"I wish I would have read more about this movie before I spent my time watching it. I found it to be amazingly boring. I gave it two stars simply because of the convincing acting (especially by Juliette Binoche). I always give the benefit of the doubt to foreign/non-conventional films, but this one just never ""took-off"" (pun intended). I found myself saying ""okay, maybe the mother has a drinking problem"", or ""maybe Song falls in love with the mother"" or ""maybe something happens to the kid while chasing the red balloon"", anything just to inject some life into the movie! I think unless you are in film school or like artistic films or are extremely patient and have nothing better to do, you may doze-off (like my wife did on several occassions). Be ready with the fast-forward button on your remote!:)"
3,"Interesting blend of klezmer, celtic, and folk","Interesting -- yet for the most part uninspired -- blend of klezmer, celtic and folk."
1,"YOU CAN DO BETTER, ALTMAN-WISE . . .","When Altman is good he's great. Like in McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Shortcuts, The Player and, oh yes, MASH. The Amazon review for BB et al should be read before ordering this. Like, flat-footed and obvious, I think they say. Beyond Altman, an akin movie of this time would be Little Big Man, which is sensational, not stupid."
3,interesting,I was filmed in my home town and a very good friend of mine was a extra in the movie and we looked at it to see if we could pick her out. Unfortunatly we did not find her. o-well
4,Terry's Tavern Sparkles With Jazz Vocals,"Vocalese is the language spoken on the disc of 10 cuts, each about four minutes in length making them all 'radio ready' candidates. What strikes this reviewer is the potential of this group of three singers. Trying to walk in the shadow of Manhattan Transfer and more recently New York Voices is a daunting thing to be sure. The group has its own unique style yet what's lacking are some jazz standards to serve as a benchmark. All are original compositions save one Donald Fagen tune. It would have been interesting to hear Triad perform ""Airegin"" or ""Benny's From Heaven"" or some other fast paced number just to hear how unique they could be. Most of the tunes take the form of ballads and none really cool. Mainstream fans may not dig this effort by Triad, but if your preferred style of jazz leans to vocals and vocalese then you may like Terry's Tavern.-Jonathan Barg, L.A. Jazz Scene, August 1994"
1,never got it...,I am sure its a great book but even after trying to contact all parties involved I never got the right book.
3,Included in Mulligan Stew - for collectors only,"Though entertaining enough, this play appears in its entirety as a small part of Sorrentino's magnum opus MULLIGAN STEW. You can read it as easily there as in this form. Plus you'll have the rest of Mulligan Stew as well. So I recommend you only buy this volume if you're the sort of collector who owns books because of what they are, not what they say."
5,Almost 20 years of use,I am on this site to purchase more of this classic flatware. We have lost several pieces over the years and it is time to replace them. My family has used this flatware on a daily basis after receiving them as a wedding gift in 1988. They have worn very well and the stying is modern but classic. Time to buy a few more.
5,helped learned,"My children learned their tables. I love the music, and the pictures used to demonstrate the facts. I is worth the money."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this dvd from Amazon and was completely disappointed. My son couldn't make out the words and neither could I. Perhaps this happened through the process of recording from old media technology onto a dvd and it lost some of its clarity. I'm not sure. My 8 year old son, who I bought it for, watched the zeros but refused to watch any more of it. :("
4,Lots of Fun!!,"I purchased this DVD to help my third grader learn his multiplication facts for school. He enjoys watching and looks forward to each new video as he progresses with his facts. It has taught him a couple fun tricks to help with his multiplication. I definitely need to supplement this with flashcards, but it is a fun break for him to watch this DVD."
5,Math help,This DVD/CD is worth every cent. Teaches the children not only their mulitplication facts but it also teaches them how to multiply double digit problems and has an interactive game/review at the end.
1,boring moaning from shallow gallo,"a co-worker of mine said, 'i hope you didn't pay anything more than ten cents for a vincent gallo album'. having no prior experience with vinnie, i didn't want to be biased. however, i have to commend warp for three things: (1) somehow finding the gaul to release a single cd with only one track that is 2:16 long; (2) charging people[price] for the privilege of hearing this track; and (3) having it be something as boring and tasteless as vincent gallo. vincent gallo puts together a track that was obviously done in some black artistic rage where he whines about how sad and blue he is for two minutes until the downers wear off. i can't believe i bought this, and i hope no one else will be duped as i have."
4,Does what it's supposed to,It's a tap guide or drill guide so that you tap/drill straight with a handheld drill. It works for that purpose as long as you're careful. I would be better if it was a big bigger or provided a surface where you could easily clamp it to what you're working on.
4,Anyone seen my Shoes?,A textbook example of how to really screw up a good thing! I use it to start a discussion in class of what to do when difficult choices come up.
3,No World Series winner here,"Most baseball movies are pretty lousy when it comes to portraying the game as played on the field. But in this movie, that part is the best part of all; in fact, the baseball part of this picture might be better done than in any other movie. It's all about the 1919 Black Sox scandal. Factually it's as straight as an arrow: all the incidents - even the progress on the field of the games of the World Series - are factually acurate. But the movie never probes beneath the surface of the ball players. The scenes with the gamblers, the obligatory kids on the street whose innocence is stained by their heroes, and the players themselves act like a bunch of second-stringers with an amateur script. The movie is very flashy, but also very shallow. Disappointing."
1,Should be rated!,I didn't get to finish it because of the profanity. It should be rated PG-13 for the language.
4,Eight Men Out: A drama baseball film,"Eight Men Out is a perspective of the 1919 Black Sox scandal, with Buck Weaver as the main protagonist.The Black Sox scandal remains one of the most controversial events in sporting history, and this film does offer considerable insight, which covers several different sides of the story.It is almost instinctive to want to support the players, yet there are numerous factors presented that make this a difficult choice.The film acknowledges that whilst Weaver had knowledge of ""the fix"" he didn't profit or participate beyond knowing, which became the basis for his persecution.Injustice towards him, as a far less guilty man, to this day remains a point of debate. The film is to an extent a public pardoning of Buck Weaver.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Baseball Author"
5,Eight Men Out,"Bought this movie for two reasons, I liked it a lot, and I was able to be an extra for the game scenes that were shot in Indianapolis."
2,8 men strike out,This was a very vague and boring movie. Many of the big name actors have little roles. If you want to see a baseball movie watch Major League. Spur rules!
4,The real story!,This is a great movie to pair with Field of Dreams! Watch this first and get the full story of what led to the loss of somephenomenol baseball players. You may also be surprised at the great old music paired with this true story.
4,Great historical account of Black Sox Scandal,"Eight Men Out is a fantastic historical film. The viewer feels for the players being cheated by their owner, and you can understand their motivations for taking the money. Great acting by John Cusack as Buck Weaver. Not as good as Field of Dreams, but certainly worth a try."
4,A Baseball Must,"Eight Men Out is a must-see for any baseball fan. I'd always known about Shoeless Joe and about the conspiracy to throw the 1919 world series, but I never knew much more about the other players involved. Although this is a movie, it gives you a different look into what happened than the history books. John Cusack does a fine job as Buck Weaver, and the rest of the cast works well together. If you're a fan of baseball, or just a fan of baseball movies, you've gotta see this movie. You won't regret it. I'd give it 5 stars, but I don't give out 5 stars."
2,More Entertaining To Stare At The Album Cover,"Catherine Deneuve is one of my favorites...such a classy actress, beautiful woman.She sang so beautifully in the film ""8 Women"" that I was looking forward to an entire album of her singing. Unfortunately Deneuve's voice (which is weak, but not that bad) is torpedoed by the mess that was the 80s. This cheesy collection of pseudo-disco pop songs have the WORST arrangements and reminded me of nothing else but the debacle that was ""The Ethel Merman Disco Album.""The results are so poor that it doesn't even make for good camp entertainment. And if I needed any further proof that the French cheese was going to get any riper, La Deneuve sings two songs with Mr. Emmanuel himself, Serge Gainsbourg, a man whose reputation and talent have always eluded me.Get the CD for the rarity that it is, but if you really are a fan of Deneuve, don't listen to it, just stare at the cover."
2,OH GOSH!,"I LOVE CATHERINE DENEUVE, HOWEVER, THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A SWORN LOVE FOR DISCO. THE SOUNDIS VERY EURO POP AND AT THE HEIGHT OF DISCO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED NOT SO GREAT THEN.LET'S GIVE CREDIT TO MS. DENEUVE FOR BRANCHING OUT AND TRYING SOMETHING NEW. GOD BLESS HER.MAYBE, IF IT WAS SUPER DUBBED AND SHE HAD A USA DISCO WIZARD TO HELP HER, THINGS WOULD HAVEBEEN DIFFERENT. INSTEAD MADONNA TOOK THAT PATH AND LOOK WHAT IT'S DONE FOR HER. I LOVE THENEW LOUIS VOUITTON ADS CATHERINE IS IN. ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION, I'M SURE THIS IS A COLLECTABLE.She is also on Malcolm Mclaren's Paris album. It's not disco, But she sounds even better there.Someone said she is also on the ""Potiche"" soundtrack, a french movie that also stars Ms. Deneuve.This isn't my favorite Catherine, But I love her in many of her otherprojects."
2,"Marginal, Faux-Traffic Also-Rans......","As usual, when Amazon doesn't put samples of ""Legendary"" or ""Seminal"" bands up, the band is not that great. I had always heard about this group, but never actually ""heard"" them. So I took a chance. This music is at best a pedestrian Traffic knock-off; at worst it's difficult to understand how these guys got signed in the first place. Again, when investigating groups from the 60's and 70's, if amazon doesn't provide any samples, buyer beware!!!"
4,A 10 mm washer makes it better,"The first time I used this otherwise nicely-made tool it was apparent that the knob that secures the depth feeler was difficult to adjust ""just right"" so that the feeler didn't move when I secured it for depth. I added a stainless steel 10 mm I.D. washer between the knob and the feeler and that solved the problem (the washer fits exactly within the recess in which the feeler slides). I can now adjust the knob so that the feeler slides easily for depth, and then tighten the knob just a bit to hold the feeler without it moving off the depth setting. A 17 cent fix that I would recommend you try.P.S. (The manual doesn't mention that the slider blocks can be secured for width by slightly tightening the screws on the bottom)."
5,Park Tool WAG-4,"Don't know if I really need this tool, When the Wheel is true in the stand every thing is good. If I had limited funds I would hold off on buying this."
3,Not for Everyone,"I am a person who wants to know everything about the philosophy of Daoism. This book is indispensible to me beacause it reveals many ""hidden"" meanings in the text of Master Zhuang (Chuang Tzu). But like some others, I find Graham gets a little too analytical for his own good (not to mention ours). He did a much better job with his translation of Lieh Tzu (Lie Zi)."
5,One of the better cds out there,"With many different types of sounds, Goldfinger has put together one of their best CDs ever created, in fact, one of the best CDS period! Starting out with the slow, but effective I'm Down, to the fast paced Donut Dan, definatley shows Goldfinger's creativity including all the great tracks in between. The only exception of the greatness to this CD is Bro, the one track, besides Donut Dan, that stands out from the others. Goldfinger tried a little too hard on making that song sound punky. Otherwise, If you like the combination of punk, pop, and ska, any of Goldfinger's CDs are a must have to your collection."
5,A musical wolf in sheep's clothing,"Despite the really cheesy, stupid looking album cover, the music hidden within is of the highest standard. Pop/ska/punk, however you want to classify Goldfinger, there is no denying the sublime (no pun intended) genius of this album. From the opener ""I'm Down"" to the final jolt of ""99 Red Balloons,"" there's enough substance here to satisfy many different kinds of listeners. There is enough power and raging riffs to satisfy the metalhead like myself, yet still the hooks and choruses to get the girls. The tracks themselves are quite diverse as well, from the heavy ""Bro"" to the mellow ""Margaret Ann,"" or the addictingly catchy ""Counting The Days,"" there is not a moment to be missed here. This is certainly one of my favorite non-metal albums, and has the kind of sound that will appeal to a great number of rock fans. Add this one to your collection today!"
5,Stomping Ground is a good CD,"Finally after months of delays this CD came out. Everything about it is good. The cover art is amazing, and the consistency is great. The whole CD flows together. It is a switch from the other three CDs becuase there are no horn parts. But I have always thought that their songs with no horns were a lot better anyways so if you are a ska freak than you might not like this new sound. There still are some ska guitar parts on San Simeon, I'm Down, You Think it's a Joke, Bro, and Donut Dan. The CD is a lot more agressive than Hang Ups but not as fast as the self titled. Just buy it."
3,"Belongs in the ""Blink 182"" section","Stragely enough, this cd was in the ""SKA"" section of the record store. Lyrically this album doesn't do it for me like the previous ones did. Goldfinger seems to be using the same formula everyone else is which is a little dissapointing."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I really LOVE the first 2 Goldfinger LPs. They're filled with excellent guitars, drums, and the excellent melodies and choruses of the vocals god John Feldman. Just hearing his voice can make listening to any of the songs twice as easy. That said, I was really looking forward to hearing ""Stomping Ground"". I don't miss the ska any, but I do miss the abundance of catchy melodies that one could get their fill of from listening to either of their earlier releases. Sure, there are a few songs that keep the sing-along spirit alive; namely ""Counting the Days"", ""San Simeon"", and the cover of ""99 Red Balloons"". On another note, ""Carry On"" is a nice change from typical Goldfinger. But all in all, I can't place Stomping Ground ahead of their first two albums. A solid effort though."
5,a MUST BUY !,At first the cd wasn't to great but as you get farther into the cd....it gets better and better! So don't base the cd on hte first time you listen to it...listen a couple more times and youll see how GREAT it is!
2,What happened?,"Well, this CD sure isn't bad, but I am just as sure that everyone who likes the old Goldfinger won't like this radio-friendly rock attempt. Especially the ""99 Luftballons"" cover shows what Goldfinger is trying to do, earning money instead of playing ska-punk."
3,"It looks nice, but...","This is a very attractive set, and like all Calphalon products, the materials are of high quality. However, the boston shaker set (glass and steel shaker) does not seal well. I have been using this for a while and keep trying different ways to lock them together and I almost always get leaks when I shake it. Also, the cocktail knife has no edge. It will not cut lemons and limes, so it is basically useless."
4,Good place to start,"This book gives great info. if you don't know a lot about flowers (pricing, names of flowers/descriptions, flower maintenance) or which flowers are available in the season you're getting married. The pictures are beautiful & the bouquets are gorgeous but I wouldn't buy this book in the hope of finding the perfect bridal bouquet. It is a good resource for ideas & to see bouquets that are creative, not tacky."
3,Ok book but nothing special,I don't think that I am very picky but this book was pretty boring. It had some pretty arrangements but honestly I think I have more luck just looking online. I ordered this to kind of help me figure out what type of flowers to use for my wedding and I regret wasting my money. I would suggest just looking on the knot and saving your cash.
5,Fantastic book for wedding flowers!,"I searched through a lot of wedding bouquet books at the local library before finding this one. This was by far the best, most comprehensive wedding bouquet book I came across."
5,beautiful bouquets,I bought this book for my sister who is getting married soon. She loved the book! It has given her great ideas and pictures for her to express to her florist what she wants. Most of the bouquets are unique and the wrappings around the flowers are a wide variety and have great ideas. I would recommend the book.
1,This tripod has a glaring flaw,"This tripod has one glaring flaw...the center metal post screw mounts into an aluminum head screw hole. I used this tripod about five times before the head was completely stripped, and I never applied much pressure to the head mount. Very poor design of an otherwise nice tripod!"
1,"Read carefully, and compare to less expensive true bumper plates","Pay attention to the product description, which contains these sentences:""Double iron castings are permanently adhered to durable rubber rims.""""Not intended for heavy lifting. INSTRUCTIONAL USE ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE DROPPED TO THE FLOOR AFTER A LIFT. Not warranted against breakage.""In other words, these are NOT solid rubber bumper plates. It is awesome that the company is honest with it's customers about this, but it's a little like selling a compact car with a warning that says ""Product actually as big as a Semi. Not intended for city driving.""True bumper plates can be had for less than the price of these too. So I'm not sure what the product strategy is."
5,the NEW 2008 version is MUCH MUCH better than the OOP HBO issue!,"I'm not going to review this dead bang CLASSIC...Gary Cooper at his prime, William Wyler at his....nuff said. What I am going to inform everybody is I just viewed the new MGM 2008 DVD against my long out of print HBO copy that I paid a fortune for and the differences are striking...I thought the original DVD was very good for its age...a bit grainy but with some good contrast and bite...but this new DVD looks like a print right off the original negative!!!! I can't believe they are not touting the amazing improvement but the first DVD was early in the DVD era and was obviously in retrospect a transfer from an inferior source. the verdict..If you are a classic film or western fan or a fan of Gary Coopers...this WILL be the best $10 you EVER spent!!! Yee Haaa!"
3,Unrestored DVD,"It's a very good film but I knock the score down for the shoddy quality of the DVD. Graininess is apparent throughout. There are also some bad scars on the film that show up. Most annoying was a frequent change in contrast. The film would jump to a faded condition, sometimes in the middle of the scene. This movie would be a real prize with a restored print on DVD. Let's hope they get around to it."
5,Best non-action Western,This has to be one of the best non-action Westerns made. Like The Searchers there is more on thought than shoot em up. Both Cooper and Walter Brennan are superb in trying to outmanuvere one another for different reasons. Cooper for his life and Brennan for Lilly Langtree (or just a lock of hair). Excellent quiet thought movie with a bang up ending.
5,The Westerner,"Although some of the historical facts were bent a little in this portrail of Judge Roy Bean, the story was a good one, and believeable. Gary Cooper was I think one of the best actors of his time, along with Walter Brennan. The two made the movie well worth watching. Its a shame that Hollywood can't remember how to make movies like this anymore. This is a movie that wasn't just a western, but like the others Starring Gary Cooper with Walter Brennan they were very entertaining not just a shoot'm up, but movies with moral charactor, and Fiber."
2,Boring . . . .,"I was really excited to get this movie as the overwhelming majority of reviews were all 5 stars. There's no question that this movie is well directed and well acted. HOWEVER, the story prods along at a snails pace and there simply is very little going on . . . Judge Roy Bean has a silly fettish with Lillie Langtree and Cooper plays on that fettish in order to save himself from being hung. The entire movie is mostly dialogue between Cooper and Bean and I found it thoroughly boring. I'm a big fan of westerns -- even those with little action -- but this movie just couldn't hold my interest. I'm really surprised that so many have rated it 4 and 5 stars."
4,pleasently surprised & humoured,"While the movie is a very good example of classic well-made westerns, I'm surprised no one has mentioned what sets it apart from most others- there is a terrific sense of humor in the film, in both situation and the terrific protrayal of characters. It doesn't take itself as seriously as other westerns and for the non-western-buff is much easier to watch and much more enjoyable."
5,5 reasons why The Westerner is great,"1)Toland's cinemeotography is the best2)Walter Brennon is the best,funniest,most unrealistic Judge Roy Bean,to pass out with an Ace up his sleeve..3)Gary Cooper is surrounded by the an awesome cast of of great character actors,the likes of which you won't see again..4)These guys are mostly gone,their acting is so good,you realize,to late,that actors like these are no longer available..5)The director tells his story from a script,it fits together puzzlelike,a part of a genre thst is so American,it is hurtful to watch it.."
5,Mountainlaurel pack......... excellent 2 nighter!,I went on my first official backpacking excursion and this pack held everything. It had plenty of compartments for everything I needed and held up well. I can't wait to use it again!
4,45 lb Weight,"The item was ok, but it was not what I expected. I thought I was getting 45 lbs of small weights, not one big weight. The picture that was shown was deceiving. I had to send the weight back only because it was not what I wanted. The product was good though."
2,Readiness to Sacrefice..........his career,Well there are one or two songs that may have been saved if they weren't ravaged with pop sounds....other than that this is a diaster.
5,"Intense, clean, honest flavors - and almost dairy-free!","My household is full of eaters who are allergic to dairy products - but are Italian and love Italian food. Bugialli's book on Sardinian cooking saved the day. This book lets US-based cooks, using common (or easy to find) ingredients, create authentic Italian dishes that taste wonderful and are virtually dairy-free. The desserts section, of course, relies fairly heavily on dairy products. But the flavors provided by the main courses are so intense and clean, you can skip dessert and still be completely satisfied. Grazie, Signor Bugialli"
5,Gorgeous Cookbook with Wonderful Recipes,"This cookbook is stunning. It is done in the oversized format with lots of pictures and details. Mr. Bugialli gives information about the food and the people. I think I went through this book 2-3 times just looking at it and reading it before I even looked at the recipes. Good stuff in here, especially if you like seafood. (What else would people on an island eat?)Some of the items may be difficult, if not impossible to find, but he gives easy substitutions for most of them."
4,australian sci-fi worth seeking,"Voices in the Light is the first book in Sean McMullen's Greatwinter series. I bought it in Australia a few years ago and loved it!Unlike so many sci-fi authors, McMullen doesn't seem to need distant space to drive the action of his stories. This one takes place in a distant-future Australia, where technology is basic and electricity is forbidden.I'm a believer in giving away as little as possible, but take my word for it -- these books are well worth whatever trouble you take to get your hands on them. I spent several months searching for the second in the series and was not at all disappointed once I found it!"
4,Australian SF Reader,"This says it is book one of Greatwinter, which it is, but it also becomes half of a later book one of Greatwinter. Confusing? Maybe a little bit, it was for me when I stumbled across one earlier and one later book. If you have this and Mirrosun Rising you mostly have Souls in the Great Machine, although that is changed a bit, it is pretty much the same story, and still good. Collect 'em all. :)"
3,Check Out The Rhino Release!,"As several have stated, the original lp and this cd contain a condensed program of the original show. BUT, Rhino's Handmade series is a numbered, limited, 2 cd set of two complete shows! Yes, it's 2 nights of Raunch 'n Roll! Some songs are repeated, but there's plenty of additional material exclusive for each night. Unfortunately, it doesn't look as though Amazon carries the Rhino release, but I believe it's still available at Rhino Handmade web site.The remastering is quite good for what it is (Raunch 'n Roll), though I still prefer the sound of the orginal vinyl--hence the 3 stars. Forgetting the comparison to the lp, the Rhino edition is the best, and the one to buy!"
4,Aptly Named,"As a kid growing up in the midwest, I bought this album just for the album cover alone -- these guys looked wild! And let me tell you, you can judge a book by its cover. This is a great addition to CD, as this has a good variety of previously recorded tunes, and some you can't get elsewhere (Getting Kinda Cocky, Hot Rod, Gigelo, and UP. Album starts great with a kicking boogie and high voltage electric guitar send-up on Getting Kinda Cocky. The rest of side one builds up to Hot Rod, which made every high school boy smile. Hot and Nasty is great boogie and guitar work, Mutants of the Monster has some great bass work for your sub-woofer, and Up has that mid-70's long jam going for it, ending in some sonic guitar crecendo's. If you're looking for artsy rock, this ain't it, but if you want something with more than a little kick, this is it."
2,Not very relaxing:(,"Well I was looking for a relaxation CDROM for evenings, to help me achieve deeply relaxed states. This is not the CDROM for that. A couple reasons come to mind as I'm writing this:1. The CD is divided by several tracks, and at the end of several you are told to open your eyes. That doesn't help when it comes to meditation and achieving deep relaxation.2. The volume level seems to change on about the 2nd or 3rd trak, it suddenly becomes louder then the previous tracks. So if you start it our loud enough to hear, it late becomes too loud, and you would have to get up and turn it down.Overall, very inneffective for those looking for deep states of relaxation.In a pinch, irt's better then nothing. I do not recomend purchains this product for any more then about 5 bucks. Thumbs down :("
2,Disappointed,"This disc seemed to be just what I was looking for. Alas, it was not. The tracks are so short that you hardly get a chance to relax before you are told to open you eyes again. ... I feel like I was taken."
3,"Interesting, But Take The Title Seriously","This is a strange little book, comprised of interviews and quotations from the Red Sox - from the FANS of the Red Sox. The back cover makes the following statement - It's like sitting around the ballpark listening to friends reminiscing about the team we all love. Except, for the author, who himself admits to being a Cardinals fan. Apparently this is part of a series - For Yankee Fans Only! and For Met Fans Only! have also been published. My advice? Get this book, set it next to the TV, and the next time Pedro & Co. are playing, grab a beer and this book and read while you watch."
1,Very one-sided book,"I picked up the book thinking that it would give me an insight into 50s Cuba. However, because it was peppered with too many personal memories (it is a memoir after all), the book gave no insight into life in Cuba.Furthermore, the memoir turned out to be a vitriolic diatribe against Castro with words such as 'pig-headed', 'buffoon', and 'b******' used liberally by the author. The book is written in pretty simple (badly written?) English with unimaginative prose.The only interesting part of the book deals with how Mr. Rodriguez picks up his life after coming to the US as a penniless migrant."
2,Product Description is Incorrect.,"I was careful to make sure that the shaft diameter was listed as 1/2"", but the item I received had a shaft diameter of just slightly over 3/8"". I could have purchased another brand of a similar item for much less. I thought I was paying a little more for something more robust, so I was left disappointed. In fact, I purchased another nearly identical item made by Hyde on the same order, and the same thing occurred with it--the product description clearly states the shaft being 1/2"" diameter, but it turned out to be exactly 3/8""."
5,good toy,"My 3 year old son loves to play with this, especially making big numbers. The only complaint - it is a really messy thing because of all those circles lying around in my living room:)"
2,What happened?,"I don't know if it's just how the seller packaged this toy or if it is poorly made, but the toy came squished up and really deformed! The box/package wasn't so much as dented.I was going to give this to my nephew for a birthday present. I certainly didn't- that would be incredibly poor taste in its condition! I donated it to a toy drive. I'm sure that it'll make *someone* happy."
1,Save your money.,"Q: How many versions of Everyday I Write the Book does one need? A: Three versions less than are included in this collection. There's a really good reason the ""1984 Dance Mix"" is only now making its ""CD DEBUT"" ...it's awful. Costello has already released all the best stuff in this collection at least 3 times. Buy the Rhino or Ryko re-issues instead. Even Amazon tries to clue us in... ""This Set is Essential for Collectors who Relish the Fun of Having Everything in the Costello Canon."" ...meaning: if you think it's ""Fun"" to be a completist, you'll ""Relish"" spending another $50 to stay that way."
3,Buyer Beware,"Please be aware there are 2 versions of this disc. I received the 12 song version on the German Pilz label. Apparently, there is another version with 4 bonus tracks. I'd try for that cd. While the songs were fine, the sound was iffy and that is why I only gave this album 3 stars instead of 4. In fact, I could swear the disc was copied from an LP and not remastered digitally. I like this period in Ms. Faithful's catalog, although she does not sing with the folkish beauty of her earliest albums. The songs are interestingly sung and produced. On the whole, I recommend this album for the music, but buyer beware of which version you are ordering."
2,damaged,I ordered an extension and i just opened it up after a month of sitting in my garage and the pole was bent. you could clearly see that it had some kind of defect. maybe this is what the company puts out when they dont have to see their customers face to face.
2,"Harry Houdini is a great draw, but It's really just marketing hype.","I thought it would be a kick to read this old book from the great Harry Houdini. It was probably pretty interesting when first written, but gives quite vague and relatively uninteresting information now."
3,"eccentric, interesting, and sometimes offensive","I am not sure what to think of a book of ""scholarship"" that lacks a single footnote to back up its often bizarre claims related to the pre-Columbian settlement of the Americas. Also, its casual racism seems to be over the top even for the forties, when it was written. Nevertheless, Gladwin's bold, intuitive leaps of speculation can now be seen to anticipate what many more cautious researchers are beginning to suspect about the ethnic makeup and history of the earliest Americans.I was curious to note that not once did Gladwin mention the Olmecs, an early Mesoamerican civilization which may have had African origins. I have to wonder whether that was a product of his antiblack bias, evidenced by the extremely unfunny cartoons and snide remarks found throughout the book."
4,A go to book for something different.,"What can I say, I have had this book for many years and it is my go to book for occasions when I want something a little different. The recipes are never hard, but sometimes rely a little too much on obscure ingredients (who has Kecap Manis laying around???).All in all, both my wife and I love this book and though we do not refer to it frequently it gets used quite often in our household."
3,not like Byron Lee,"I was at a Lee concert this week and ordered his ""Soca Frenzy"" from Amazon. I clicked on this CD so that I could hear the audio sample in the meantime (I miss the song!) but honestly, Lee is much better. Get Soca Frenzy, you won't be sorry, and Lee also has a new CD, Soca Tremor which is pretty good."
5,PTL Parallel Bible,This Bible presents the familiar and time proven wording of the King James Version plus an easy to read paraphrase side by side.Reading the two two together is very helpful in understanding the message of the Bible.The large print was very easy to read.
2,Great read until halfway through,"Dirk writes an entertaining tale of his life and romance with, health food and macrobiotics long before the latter two were common terms. I was enjoying his well-crafted prose up until he explains his prostate cancer ""diagnosis"". What a whack job. I am all for diet regulation but come on, no biopsy? Which is what he referred to as ""exploratory surgery! I couldn't stomach wasting any more time on this ridiculous and dangerous approach to ""prostate cancer"". I'll make you a good deal on the book, perfect condition 'cept for a few dog-ears. Half has not even been read yet."
2,Irresponsible,"I understood from this book, that Mr Benedict believes that smoking is hardly any threat to one's health as long as one gives up dairy products. I think he is fooling himself, and has been fooled by his macrobiotic diet guru's.I sincerely hope that he only smokes when he is alone, or if there are only smokers around him. I am sure he would not want non-smokers nearby, who eat dairy, to get cancer from breathing in what he is breathing out.I sold the book after only reading half of it - I do not appreciate someone trying to pull the wool over my eyes."
5,Everything you (or your partner) needs to know,"I am the coauthor of this book and am proud of my work, with one caveat at the end of this review. This book covers prostate cancer from the prospective of a surgeon who treats the disease and who admits that he was terrified when he was diagnosed with it himself. Prostate Cancer for Dummies covers symptoms of prostate cancer and how it's treated (surgery, radiation, etc.) and also covers how to cope with the side effects, such as impotence, depression and so on. The author factors in how cancer affects the whole family and discusses how the person with cancer can help his family help him. One caveat: The book urgently needs to be updated to reflect the latest surgical therapies, medications and other treatments for prostate cancer. It was, after all, written nearly ten years ago and great advances have been made in treatment for prostate cancer since that time.Christine Adamec"
1,Bland,"I finally heard this, curious because I couldn't imagine anything being better than LaChiusa's version. And I was right. This is bland. It's easy. It's safe. LaChiusa pushes the musical into a more sophisticated direction, continuing the work of Stephen Sonheim, Kurt Weill, and Leonard Bernstein. While LaChiusa's score restored a bit of dangerous cool to the musical, Lippa only revels in its cheesiness. Compare the two opening numbers and you will see where LaChiusa employs a wonderfully theatrical metaphor to describe Queenie and Burrs, Lippa has them practically INDICATING their emotional states. Not very dramatic. Buy the LaChiusa version. Toni Colette gives the best performance in a Broadway musical since Donna Murphy in PASSION."
4,Taken by surprise,"Being a huge ""Marie Christine"" fan, I figured that when I bought Michael John LaChiusa's ""The Wild Party"" I would never want for more. Stumbling through Virgin, I found Andrew Lippa's and thought ""What is this?"" Seeing that Idina Menzel and Taye Diggs were both in it, I was curious (RENT fan, you know) Anyway, I took it home and was a little if-y at first, but then, eventually fell in love with it. I listened to it so many times, I have to go and buy a new copy because it is completely scratched up. With each listening, I found nuances that riveted me and made me rewind that specific part. Whereas Michael John LaChiusa's is musically structured for the play, I like Lippa's better because it is more fun. Which is basically in my opinion (being a musical theatre actor) what theatre is all about. Buy this musical right away. You will not want for more"
1,QUITE BORING,"I agree with the commentator who suggests that this musical is boring. Actually, I almost fell asleep while listening to this blunt music inserted in a vapid story. I would not recommend it. Actually, there's nothing wild about this party."
5,Amazing... Simply Amazing,"Definatley one of the best soundtracks of a musical that i've ever heard. I am a dancer, and this year I am doing a dance to the upbeat bubbly song ""Raise the Roof"", but personally i think every single song on this soundtrack could be used for a dance, or just as a feel good song. They're so easy to relate to, it's hard NOT to love it!"
1,I think not!,This show was realy bad! So this CD is really bad. The Broadway show IS WAY BETTER! Do NOT buy this CD. Always buy Broadway Eartha Kitt ROCKS!!!
4,"Improvijazzation Nation, May 1999","Rik Wright, Tannar Brewer, Simon Grant have produced a CD that is strongly rooted in funk, lots of nice walkin' bass, cool jazzy guitar (without th' 'fluff') & drums that just won't quit. They have a very interesting style that I want to call 'textural experimental', because even though they lay claim to funk, the bass is of the gentle variety, rather than straight slap all the time! & that's a GOOD thing, because it leaves plenty of free space for the lead guitar & drummer to move in th' directions th' muse leads them! Wah-wah work is a solid piece of nostalgia for me, but others may not be quite as attracted to it as I was. From a ""rating"" standpoint (for readers interested in purchase), this gets a MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,"Seattle Weekly, July 1999","Being a power trio isn't enough these days. With the Jackhammer Trio, guitarist Rik Wright, along with Tannar Brewer and Simon Grant, drill down on some serious avant-jazz improv."
4,Good performance.,"Excellent product, good performance. It is a product pleasant in sight, very good performance, excellent to work and to share entertainment in the home"
1,Bad screen display,"After two months using, my wife and I realized the screen display is not good. There is glares and characters are crisp clear. We have rest our eyes every hour or so. We did try various display settings.I have used other laptop brands - dell, ibm/lenovo, hp; had no complaints on the laptops display.You need to see it before you buy."
2,Average and overpriced notebook,"I got this notebook almost a year ago. Although it worked for me but its not that great and perheps the worst model made by Sony. At that time it was very much over priced with respect to its features and still its price is relatively high as compared to similar products from other companies. Performance is good with respect to its specs i.e. Core duo, 1GB RAM etc. Keyboard is not too good, it is just OK. Speakers are worst I have seen in any laptop however if you mostly use headphones then sound card is reasonably good and it should not be a problem. Microphone is absent, which irritated me most becuase always i needed to use external mic for chating.Handling is also not too good, like a sony product should be. Means overall it was not as per my expectations however it worked for me."
5,Pretty Good for something that came with a magazine subscription!,"This DVD was sent out free to all IJA members. The IJA is basically a magazine subscription and grants access into one very expensive juggling convention per year, so getting a free DVD from them was a nice suprise. I wasn't expecting much, but it was a lot longer than I expected and was entertaining. Some segments were better than others and the whole DVD was dubbed over with royalty free music that kind of took away from the original music that was played in the segments.Out of the sections that stood out, I really enjoyed the Ivan Pecel cruise ship segment and the segments on the juggling festivals/conventions."
3,OK film,"Kinda boring film. The performances are pretty good, especially Kate Winslet's, but the script is so full of those 19th century romance cliches(ala Rob Roy and Dances With Wolves). The only truly exciting part of this film is Kate's nude scene. For all the sex addicts out there who couldn't get enough of her in titanic will go nuts over this one! Other than that, if you're in the mood for a soppy and overlong drama, than this is for you."
4,It's a powerful movie,I always love to watch good Brit movie and I think this one was one of the best. Kate Winslet gave a wonderful performance. This movie was sad but also touching.
2,Sloooooow and depressing,"Slow moving, very depressing account of a young man's subconscious drive toward achieving unhappiness - every decision he makes is another step towards that goal.The sex scenes are totally gratuitous."
4,Jude...,"...was one of the saddest movies I have ever seen. Kate Winslet is the most talented actress of my generation. Her performance, as usual, was in my eyes flawless. She is an asset to any film that she appears in. The scene where her child takes it upon himself to take care of their problems is one of the saddest scenes on film I have ever witnessed. Her heartbreak and saddness made me feel as thought that horrible thing had just happenned to me personally. I loved this film."
4,Makes you realize how good you have it.,"I made the mistake of renting this movie on Valentines'Day. Luckily I watched it alone. I had no idea it was such a depressing movie. The back of the video said nothing. That aside, I did watch it to the end because it is a well acted movie and you do want to know what happens. This movie really makes you appreciate your life, especially if you are a woman. But make sure you have time to think and be depressed after watching it."
2,Very poor,"Bleak, harrowing melodrama. Expertly acted. Cold as a stone. On no level can watching this film be called enjoyable. Punishing."
3,Seen It Before,"This movie has a lot of good attempts. Attempts for stories, side-stories, and some very good acting too. It's very melancholic, unsnobbishly philosophic, and very sad too. But somehow, you've seen it all before (except of the young child killing his sisters and committing suicide)."
3,Good enough for one viewing,"You don't need to see this more than once; it just isn't that fantastic. The actors are serviceable and the story plays out the way you might expect it to. I did think it was not necessary to show Jude's wife giving birth so graphically, though.It's okay."
4,Depressing yet beautiful,"As with most Kate Winslet films, this isn't for everyone. Kate Winslet delivers one of her best performances and proves that she's an actress willing to take risks. Brilliantly acted, wonderfully directed, Jude (although it is tough to watch) is a brilliant film worthy of your attention."
4,Very powerful film.,"Jude is a very powerful film. It is also very disturbing, but it is absolutely a must see. This is an adaptation of Thomas Hardy's last novel, the film isn't exactly like the novel, but if you can ignore that then you'll find that this is quite a terrific film. Just don't expect exactly what you got from the novel. Over all I give it four stars."
1,Be Careful,"If you have a tender heart toward children, then do not watch this film. All other elements aside, what ultimately happens to the children in this novel made me drop to my knees in front of my television and weep. When it was over I proceeded to have my worst night of sleep for the year. True, the character studies are excellent, including that of the oldest child, and the faithfulness to Hardy's vision is sufficient. There is a gratuitous nude scene involving Kate Winslet that was, nevertheless, nice to have to endure (the nakedness of her character, I suppose, is meant to reflect the nakedness of emotion between the cousins during that moment of their consummation, as well as their naked position in society with regard to social taboo). Ultimately, however, I do not like graphic depictions of children suffering violence, and I do not recommend this film for that reason."
5,"Excellent, Original, Beautifully-Acted, Well-Directed","This is a must-see film. I saw it before I saw the movie Titanic and knew that the Actress Kate Winslet was going to be a star, eventually. For her young age she has a sense of maturity and unique beauty seldom found in actresses these days. I was shocked by the ending by there are some deep metaphors about life in the movie and the ending was an example of one. The male lead, Eccleston, was excellent and expect he will go far in movie making as well."
4,an on and off target of thomas ahrdy classic novel.,"I found Jude to be often to depressing and lacks fire that manges to get you through scene that where often over done. The cinematorpghy was darky, often to dark. Sven Nykvist would have done a better job . The only aspect that helps you to maintain intrest was Kate winslet brillant preformace as sue. She was the only person who seemed real and i cared about. She dervers a better showcase for her preformance. Eccleston had his moments as jude but not enough of them and rachel grifftihs was complety miscast. Hossi Amen did a somwhat good job of turning the novel into a film, but he often left out the charaters motivations . His sceen play does get to the heart of Hardys novel which is quiet an accomplishment. The music was impressive as well. I also like how the sceen play was not to sentimental. I also like who the film ended. No convetions here. Essanltiy the film was a good film verson of the novel . But it could have been a classic."
3,Why tamper with a classic?,"Excellent performances and lovely cinematography, the film sometimes catches the power of Hardy's novel, but why tamper with the book's ending? Similar to the blight that is Demi Moore's ""Scarlett Letter,"" do studios and directors believe that melancholic finales have no place in movies? The tale as originally told continues to be popular for a reason...."
2,A good soundtrack in search of a movie.,"About the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music. The producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who's not screwed-up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick, incestuous, and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in. If you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood, don't watch this!"
1,one horrible movie,"Unless you have to examine all Dragon Ball related items, you should avoid this movie at all cost.For die hard DB fans, go for it, but the movie is bad, and this DVD production is even worser."
1,Awful!,"I am a dragonball fan. I have watched most every episode of dragonball, dragonball z and dragonbal gt.This live action movie is really pretty awful, but it does actually follow the script of the movie on the Dragonball - the Saga of Goku boxed set. Strangely that movie retells the opening as a movie instead of as a series of episodes and is itself awful.In the episodes, goku is a true hero. He shines. He is fearless and caring right from the start. In the movie (both animated and this one) he is really no better than yamcha! Further, there is almost zero character development in the movie, so you honestly just don't care about any of them.I wouldn't let anyone I know watch either movie if I had any hope of them getting into the rest of this series."
2,exactly like the source matterial,this movie is almost a shot for shot remake of dragoball curse of the blood rubies and thats a bad thing. they complained that dragonball evolution was bad because it wasnt close to the sourse matterial well this was as close as you can get except the names other then that its a shot for shot remake. dragonball just can not look good on film if its that close to the source it just dosent work.you want a good db movie go see db evolution its greatDragonball: Evolution
1,Cleanup?,"Make no mistake! This product resembles old chewing gum, when trying to remove from drywall, brick, cinder block, etc. If left on, for long periods, ie; classroom for a year, you will find it nearly impossible to remove without resorting to chemical means. It will often remove the drywall's paper and/or paint from underlying surface. Don't expect your custodian to appreciate this as a means to hang stuff on a wall, unless nobody cares what it looks like ever again."
1,Not so sticky tack,"This sticky tack is not very sticky. It sticks the the walls great, but only until you attach a piece of paper to it. The paper rarely stays up! About half the time, there is blue residue left on the wall where the tack was. I do not recommend using this product."
2,Not really worth it.,"I have been learning Russian with a tutor for 16 months. When I first started, my first tutor recommended I buy this book as a supplement. Needless to say, I am no longer with that tutor, and this book only collects dust. First off, there is no possible way to teach yourself Russian using only a book. The case system is complex and sometimes things just need to be explained before you can start using it. This book only teaches things like colors, numbers, dates, weather -- but you could finish it 4 times, and not be able to hold any sort of conversation. Unfortunately, I have don't really any other recommendations as I now use a book my tutor brought with her from Russia. All I know is, that you will not learn much from this book."
4,perfect for what I needed,"My 14 year old son suddenly decided he wanted to learn Russian a few months ago. When he was still talking about it six weeks later, I started looking around for resources. Rosetta is too expensive until I see how serious he is about it. I wanted a book with a CD so he could hear how it sounds, so that left out a bunch of others. In spite of the negative reviews, I decided to give this one a try. It is perfect for what we wanted. He has yet to open the book, so I can't say much about that (and that's why I didn't give it 5 stars). But the CD is great, especially for kids. It's just vocabulary-- he won't learn how to carry on a conversation this way. But for less than $20, he is learning all kinds of words, and I get to test out how serious he is about it. The graphics are low-key, but good enough that he doesn't mind them. He's been using it every day for a couple of weeks now. I have no complaints."
5,Excellent Starter Program for Russian,"I was a Russian linguist for the military many moons ago. My son showed an interest in the language, and he signed up for a non-credit course at the local community college. This book is used as a text for the course. When it arrived, I looked it over and was highly impressed with all of its features: from flashcards to the software on disk, I could not imagine a more complete program for beginning Russian. Here comes the ""if only"": if only I had such a tool and guide to conversational Russian when I was learning the language, I could have done so much more at the outset. Excellent product. You get more than your money's worth."
2,"great stickers, but no stress marks","Unfortunatley, although this book is good for visual learners who only intend to read Russian, it is actually a very bad book for anyone who wants to speak the language at any point. The reason is (and I found this out the hard way) that there are absolutely NO indications of word stress or accent marks in the book. In russian, each word has only one, very strong stress point. If you leave out the stress or misstress a word, most Russians will not understand you. Believe me, it's true. Don't bother with this book. If they reprint it with stress marks, it will be worth the money."
1,Don't bother,"This book gives absolutely no insight into the complexities of Russian grammar, and the 'phonetic transcription' will help you do nothing other that get laughed at by native Russian speakers if you try to use it on them. Basically, a good waste of money."
5,learning russian,"this is an excellent resource. We use it for homeschooling. it provides worksheet type papers to document your progress. we fill it out only aftr mastery of section on reg. paper. WE combined this with some fun word picture book, early russian reader, a russian-english dictionary, library audio and a tutor once-a-week and less as we progress accurately."
3,a bit outdated and inane but a practical read,"i sort of laughed when the book references negroes and women (as if they are only housewives) but the author makes a point to go out of his way to basically conclude that there is no conclusion. he makes many interesting points on the individuals' biological response, conditioned response, and general inborn responses to light and color based on years of study relating to birds, bees, psychotics, and people in general. i will keep it as a tool to look back on and relate to my architecture planning but would not really recommend someone expect too much out of this book."
3,"Close Encounters Communication in Interpersonal Relationships, by Guerrero","What's great about this book is that it's way cheaper than the third edition but has essentially all the same content. Just look at your course syllabus to see 3 of the chapters are shifted. (That's about it!) As far as the content goes...well, it was pretty much common sense or information I've learned from previous classes. Also, I haven't learned too many useful techniques (such as examples of cognitive behavioral methods) to apply to my relationship. I wish the book would have told me exactly how to talk to my partner when troubles come up."
2,Not a fan of these cufflinks. Returning to Amazon,I wasn't impressed with these cufflinks. The cufflinks were very small and the details left much to be desired. I decided to return for a refund.
5,FAST SHIPPING OF ROLLER'S !,My Screen Door Roller's were broken I ordered item's and they were here in a very few day's !!!I installed them fast and the Roller's are still rolling ! Great Fast Service !!!
3,Not quite brilliant,"The premise of the film is very strong, and the nonchalant way the protagonist relates what for most of us would be a disaster (i.e. to be struck blind in an attack) is very powerful and touching. However, the fact that the images - for me - lack another layer of meaning is not a plus. I had hoped for something as allusive as 'Sans Soleil' but in the end I found most of the image work lackluster and formless. I stayed riveted to the voice over and the revelations of his strange life 'post blindness' but I could as easily have listened to an audiobook.Good, but not great."
2,Major Disappointment,"A collection of live songs (don't believe the promos), each song abruptly faded near its middle. If they had the songs, why in heaven's name cut each song in such poor,sophomoric fashion? Many of these fades are during Etta's vocal solos! Save your $$ and find this in the used/cutout bins."
4,better with age,Muddy Waters songbook is a great addition to any hog lovers colection.In the same vain as hog in wolfs clothing.How can you go wrong using 2 of the all time blues greats material & re-doing it as only T.S. & the hogs can do.Highly recomend and waiting for a John Lee Hooker ala Groundhogs CD.
3,Not nearly enough!,"Does it strike anyone as weird that the available output of one of the finest soul singers in history would be resticted to a greatest hits compilation? Where is my favorite Picket track, ""Help The Needy""?This is all killer, but Picket, although not the most prolific artist in R&B;, could certainly fill another disc of equally great material. Might be better to grab all his in-print albums rather than miss out."
3,The King Wilson Picket,"If you like Wilson Pickett, then you probably know where James Brown got his style...no doubt about it. This CD's sound was not as good as I expected...purchased as a gift for a collector and he liked it...so who is to say. The legend lives on....Willson was one of the bestest!"
5,Origin of the Species by Charles Darwin,"I read this incredible book eight years after I retired from a career in academia. A big regret is that I did not read this groundbreaking book early in my career. If I had done so, I could have benefited from Darwin's insights and his remarkable example as a scientist. I was unfamiliar with the vast scope of research he conducted himself, his scores of connections to other scientists, and his global perspective. Origin of the Species should be a must-read for everyone with a natural curiosity about life around us."
4,"Worthwhile, but doesn't replace the book","Good, well read. At some points I wanted more of the text from the book. There is enough here to understand the points of each chapter. I enjoyed it, serious readers/scholars should buy the book."
1,They forgot to include the diagram!,"How could they forget to include the famous Darwin's diagram?! Darwin refers to the diagram on many occasions, notably on page 75 of this edition, ""The accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding...,"" except there is no diagram accompanying this edition, so our understanding of this great book is to remain unaided, against the author's wishes. I checked every single page in the book by hand - the diagram is nowhere to be found. The electronic search under the ""Look inside!"" tool also shows that the diagram is not included. This edition is simply a waste of ten bucks."
1,Horrible Narration style,Narrator David Case reads this as if it is a classic 19th century work of fiction and not one of the most important books of science ever produced.
3,Wow!,"Okay, seeing as how I am a teenager, this book didn't seem very interesting at first, but after I got into it it helped me to understand this whole evolution thing. Another thing I would like to say is that I know Darwin is not the most interesting writer, but he does have some important things to say in his book. If you like to learn more about biology and things like how species and stuffed evolved, devolved, or if you are tired and just can't seem to fall asleep, read the book. It is pretty good."
1,Looking for answers to evolution questions,"I wanted to read this book to see if there was some confirmation regarding the theory of evolution. There has yet to be the evidence to prove what Darwin said would be needed to prove his theory. He wrote in the chapter on difficulties that if there wasn't proof to back up what he had written, that it would lead to unresolved issues.I always wondered how there could be fully preserved fossils which are said to be very old as typical bodies decompose in just a few hundred years. I also was wondering how there are marine fossils on the top of mountains and the book couldn't explain why.I had to conclude that the theory of evolution doesn't have proof Darwin said was needed to back up what is taught in schools as he had predicted.I will now have to look for another answer to my questions."
5,Farewel to Ruben Gonzalez,"On Monday, December 8, 2003, Ruben Gonzalez died at the unregretful age of 84. Farewell to an unbelievably charismatic and talented musician! His death is the sad realistic reminder that as great musicians like him grow old and die, so does a priceless era of music that will never be emulated.(Clarification Note: I'm not sure why there are so many previous reviews of this album under my name when I only submitted one!)"
2,"great musicians, not great music","I am a big Jazz fan, I like some of Duke Ellington big band stuff and I really like most of the small combo stuff I have heard him on. So when I got this as part of a larger boxed set (reviewed on my blog - click my name to see link to it in my profile) I was excited and full of great hopes - especially as it has Stefan Grapelli my favorite Jazz Violinist. I was sadly disappointed. The numbers don't swing for me and overall the artist sound lifeless and without spirit. I was surprised that most of the other reviewers here are so positive and listened to the album a few times to be sure. What can I say - for me is does not work. Whatever the reason I would advise you not to buy this unless you have had a chance to hear some tracks before hand and really like it."
1,JUNK!!!,"I literally kicked the saw over and ended up throwing it away after only two uses (Yes it got me that mad).... The deck vibrates so violently, that I was loosing about 1 out of every 2 tiles... The vibration would snap my tiles as I got about 1/2 way through the cut... The tiles that made it all the way through the cut were only because I had to hold down the tile and move the saw at a pace that took over a 1 minute per cut... That's ridiculous.... Save your money... If you plan on cutting a lot of tile find something else..."
2,Never got it out of the box.,"I read all the positive reviews and was happy with my choice. After reading some of the 30 positive reviews I knew it was a good saw for the money but had the feeling I'd need to upgrade the blade.Under technical details and product description reads that it includes a 10 inch blade. In the section ""What other items do customers buy after viewing this item?"" section it lists a dewalt saw blade. I bought both.***IMPORTANT!!! - This saw does not take a 10"" blade!!!!!I know it's not the fault of the product itself but this saw came all torn and tattered and the packing foam inside was rusty like it sat in water. The housing was damaged and the pan had multiple cracks in it. I had to send it back."
2,Tile Saw with Design Flaw,"After reading all the reviews for tile saws, I decided to buy this one. The bad news started when the UPS driver delivered it to the door by flipping it end over end and bouncing it on the driveway. After unpacking there were a few minor dings. The big flaw with the saw was that the back of the blade face (replace blade immediately as it is a piece of junk) was binding on the slat in the cutting table that runs parallel to the blade. So the blade would not turn. I called QEP and they told me how to align the rip fence, obviously clueless about the saw.My simple fix was to put a washer behind the blade arbor to push it out 1/8"". Now it works fine. I don't think I should have to compensate for a manufacturer's design flaws, hence the 2 stars"
1,Piece of expensive junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My family bought this saw for me as a father's day present. I needed to complete 3 different projects at home, a craft room, the kitchen and a bathroom. I used it once and had nothing but problems it broke half of every porcelain tile I tried to cut on it. It rattled the tiles so much on the metal base base that it either chipped , cracked or broke every tile I tried to cut. I had to barrow my brother-in-laws tile cutter again to do the project. I had to cut my squares in half diagonally. I wish my family had bought me that model and brand. The Tile Director by Felker. The QEP 83200 24-Inch Bridge Tile Saw with Water Pump and Stand is simply not worth the money or frustration."
4,QEP 83200 Tile Saw,"This saw was very easy to set up and use. If you need to cut longer tiles, it is the way to go. I didn't have any problem with the pump sporatically running as mentioned in other reviews. I agree that the wheels are clumsy, and it is a little difficult to move.I had porcelain tiles that were 23"" long. I used the blade that was in the carton, probably not the best, but it did the job. Don't try to cut too fast and hold the tile firmly against the table or you'll get cracked tiles and rough edges. A slow, even pace produced very smooth cuts. The laser guide was very useful."
4,tile saw,"i purchased this saw to tile my bath, kitchen floor counter top, and back splash. the saw worked fine after about 45 min. of fine tuning. the most important thing is to install the blade correctly. if the blade wobbles or has a lot of vibration, reinstall it (i did it twice). the saw has plenty of power, and cuts square if you take the time initially to set it up. even after doing all this the saw had some vibration and will sometimes crack a tile at the end of a cut. take your time. you have to remember you're getting a lot of capacity for the money and can't compare this to a $1000.00 saw. i am pleased with the results and consider this a good buy. don't forget aaa batteries for laser guide."
1,Not Happy At All,"I have stuggled with this saw for 4 days and it still is junk!!!! First the QEP people told me that I put the blade on wrong, so they ran me through that, still would not cut without major chipping, so then I decide to buy a new blade, that did not work either. The bride that the saw is to move smoothly on does not, and the thing chips every tile, and sometimes it will stop while I am cutting through. Do not buy!!!!"
2,Beware,This item is not packaged well and will probably have dents. The pump did not work. The motor shipping bolt pushed into the motor housing and damaged at least the cooling fins. The 85 pounds is too much for UPS. The saw blade is 8 inches and not the 10 inches listed in the description.
5,QEP bridge saw,I have used the saw on one tile project. I have used MK saws in the past. The blade with the saw is worthless and the laser is not usable. But the saw cut flawlessly on porcelain tile. Note the saw needs to be adjusted before using -- this includes squaring the blade and checking all other adjustments on the saw.
4,"Excellent, although not Flawless","This was one of the best tile saws I've ever used. My partner and I tiled an entire bathroom floor in natural slate, and we were able to get even the finest, thinnest of cuts from this. Cleanup was really the only place where I felt less than perfection was achieved. This is, of course, a common challenge with tile saws--the nature of the beast, I suppose--but I continue to hope someone will pioneer a new method of waste control. The frame is sturdy, though not rock-solid, but was more than adequate to get the job done."
4,Nick's track shoes,"It was hard finding track shoes for my 13 year old son (size 14) here where we live. I was suprised how easy it was to find the size and the low pricing at the Amazon web site. The shoes arrived quickly, and were used to reduce his event times the first time he used them."
4,"Beautiful, but bigger than the picture show!","It is a complete roller back, with excelent space to an small travel without problems, but it is so big to diary use."
2,Not Impressed,The handle was poorly built and when you pull it up or down it tends to get stuck and eventually pinches your finger. When I returned it the seller ended up not refunding the full amount and charging me for shipping for a defective item. Very unimpressive.
1,Don't buy this item,"The extended handle of my ""Targus OCN700 15 Side Access Notebook Roller"" was broken in my first trip. The handle bars were stuck inside the bag and now could be extended only by 2/3 of its full length. Once it was stuck inside, it was impossible to fix or even just check out. I got really disappointed and want to warn anybody considering to buy it."
3,Dimensions are far larger than the picture suggests,"The picture makes this rolling laptop case look like a rolling briefcase, but it is really almost as deep as it is wide. This is a rolling overnight bag. If that is what you want, then it is probably fine. I'm wanting something that will easily fit under an airplane seat to carry in addition to my larger carry-on bag, so will be returning this."
3,black finish problems,"Very nice writing. I bought the fine nib but to my point of view it fills like a medium like its been said before.A bit to heavy for the shirt pocket but perfect for the coat or the suit. Very good weight distribution and comfortable writing.The only problem that I found, and a mayor problem for me is that the black finish of the pen is falling apart bellow the clip and I can see the metal bellow. This pen is just 1 week old I never dropped it so.......shame.Lets see how it looks after 1 year of use!!"
5,Nearly Perfect,"Alice had some help from some other musicians on this CD and they really put the icing on the cake. Alice usually plays all of the instruments herself and does a great job, but this CD has a very polished feel that really brings out a different side of her music. Once again, the song writing is consistently excellent, in fact, I would say there isn't a bad song on the entire CD. A must have for anyone who likes good music."
1,Bad Seed,"Cute idea but if nothing grows, what's the point? I typically have no issues growing any kind of plant but was able to grow nothing but a few measly seedlings that wouldn't grow - and most of the seeds never even germinated. My 5 year old was upset but it wasn't anything we did - probably just lousy dirt and seed quality. Don't waste your money, make one yourself at home."
1,cracked dome,"When I received this product, the plastic dome was cracked, so I was going to return it, but my husband tossed it, thinking it was ready to throw away, and not realizing that I was going to return it, so I wasn't able to use it as the gift like I had planned and I wasn't able to exchange it because it was tossed, but the item was very cute and it was a cute idea."
2,This is a little on the cheap side!,"I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present. We just put it together and I have to say that it isn't very much product for what you spend. The dome is made of very lightweight plastic...the ""fairy figurine"" is nothing like what is pictured (it was even cheaper looking if that's possible.) The dirt and rocks are minimal as are the seeds.In the future I think I'd do this the old fashioned glass terrarium way but it was about 15 minutes of fun with her. Now, I just hope those seeds grow!"
2,hardly satisfied,"The main part of this gift I ordered for my girlfriend was missing from the package (the seeds). Without them the whole terrarium was nothing more than a doorstop. I just got the seeds in the mail today (after contacting 2 companies), and even if the seeds manage to germinate into seedlings, the excitement of the gift has lost its luster."
1,10 seeds sprouted grew about 1 inch the fell over dead,Followed all driections. Placed near window will good light. The soil is still moist so dont really know what the prob. is
2,looked nice but problem ! !,Looks like it would be a nice little tararium for a little girl soI got it only problem is when we tried to set it up and start the seeds growing there were no seeds to grow in the kit. States on the box that you get 4 packets of different seeds but there were none and this made for a disappointed little girl. Not happy with this purchase.
1,"A waste of money, and even worse, a waste of time","We gave the seeds the perfect amount of light and the perfect amount of water and the ideal temperature and this bio dome produced only one viable plant, if that. A handful of sprouts sprouted, but it was all down hill after that."
2,"Cute Idea, But Fails to Deliver","So we bought this for our 5 year old's birthday, who does believe in fairies. She was very excited to set it up. We were disappointed at the poor quality of materials. The bottom is pretty cheap plastic. The bell and pinwheel (to alert humans that fairies are near) really do not work. The colorful stones were not very colorful. Pretty sad."
4,Great Sci-Fi,"Not being familiar with the series, and not a particularly big fan of the original motion picture, my main reason for buying Episodes 4-8 of Stargate was the price. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised by what I was greeted by. Competent dialogue, well casted (hey, is that MacGyver?) and some nice special effects make for a series that's actually better than the movie, IMHO. The DVD transfer is OK, not great, but not terrible either. The sound is decent too, though again, nothing particularly noteworthy. Basically, it's a great show on a so-so DVD. At this price, it's an easy decision. Buy it..."
5,Only ONe Season,I have notice that since May 2001 no new shows have been release. I won't buy season 1 until I see season 2 being ready for release
5,Please purchase this CD before you die!,"You will not regret any amount you pay for it. This is Mogwai's best album by a longshot. Many of the tracks are dark instrumentals similar to Slint's Spiderland and the 2 song EP. If you enjoy those albums, you will certainly like this. But wherever Slint did not tread these guys go. The tracks on C.O.D.Y. are all dark and meloncholy, just the way I like it. In the states, none of my friends have heard of Mogwai. This makes listening to the music even better because it is so intimate. Taking all the tracks into consideration: C.O.D.Y. is a flawless album."
5,album of the year,"Mogwai have come up with the album of the year. This is a big step forward from ""young team"" because it moves on from the hard edged loud vs quiet, joy division influenced sounds of that album, to a softer more subtle sound with the old thrashing drum crescendos sparingly used, but with impressive results, breaking up the more tragic/slowly melodic parts of the album, e.g ex cowboy. The instrument playing on the album is superb & there is also good use of samples as in ""helps both ways"" and especially in punk rock where an old interview with Iggy Pop sets out Mogwai's views and the scene for the rest of the album. My favourite track was ""christmas steps"" because it used the old mogwai formula of soft guitar strumming at the start building up to loud guitar rock in the middle and a spiralling harp,(I think)\guitar climbdown at the end, I also liked it because it was more progressive than it would have been if it had been done on ""young team""."
2,Even the deaf would be traumatized by this.,"Torturously long bulids that subsequently come to nothing pretty much sums-up, ""come on die young"" and Mogwai. That's not to say I dispise instrumentals or Mogwai. But it is to say that this was an enormous let-down in the face of all the hype Mogwai's received from the music press. Sadly, it turned out to be the most somnolent recording mine ears have ever had prolonged exposure to. It manages to be cold, AND, silent and the same time."
4,GREAT ALBUM. Decent songs.,"One of the funny things about this album is that all the things the people say who like it are true...and all the things the people who don't like it say are true.No, it doesn't have too many great songs. That's why it only gets 4 stars.HOWEVER, I do not believe that the songs are at all meant to be listened to individually. The structure is FAR stronger in the album as a whole than in any individual song.In other words: don't buy this album to listen to the songs. Buy it to listen to the album. Taken as a single piece of music, it's simply unbelievable."
4,Incredicbly dumb,"Cody is one of those albums which really pisses me off. Having seen the glorious Mogs live at the london forum, and having already bought some of their previous brilliant recordings, including 'TenRapid', and 'Youngteam', I found myself both amazed by the INCREDIBLE moments on this album, like the wonderfully brief, and iggy pop featuring; 'punkrock', the minimalist heavy metal of 'xmassteps' and the cacophonous masterpiece of 'excowboy'. Other highlights include the insidiously rapturous 'chocky', and the delightful 'Waltz for aidan'. But, quite simply there are large chunks of this album which are just unbearably repetitive and unnecessary. At least 3 of the tracks seem to just be DUMB filler, and make you seriously doubt this bands' quantity of range and experimentation. To be positive though, the high points that are here are simply stunning."
3,"They really liked ""OK Computer""","While this album on its own is fairly good, its quite obviously heavily influenced by Radiohead's ""OK Computer"".Now one could offer that if you're going to copy any album of recent release, OK Computer is the album to copy. Slow, droning, vacant and dark, it certainly is a masterpiece. Nonetheless, Mogwai seems to have made very little effort to depart from the Thom Yorke influence."
1,"Brilliant album, lousy mastering","Even though I already own the original CD release of Brain Salad Surgery from 1986 (which follows the original vinyl album very closely), as an ardent fan of ELP since 1972 I decided that I would like to have this Rhino re-issue as part of my collection. On listening I was flabbergasted to hear that the whole sound of the album had been changed, most notably on Toccata and Karn Evil 9. It seems as though the people responsible for the re-mastering thought that Keith Emerson's keyboards should be brought even more to the fore, and that Greg Lake's bass guitar and Carl Palmer's drums were annoyances that should be subdued as much as possible. This may make no difference to someone hearing the album for the first time, but to someone who knows the album inside out it was a huge dissapointment. It's very annoying when listening to an album and you are humming a bass riff that can't be heard from the loudspeakers. So, what should have been five stars has to be only one."
3,I did enjoy this book,The book The Place of Lions was exelent. I enjoyed this book most of all because of the adventure. I think kids from twelve down would enjoy this magnificent book. I think mostly boys would like this and maybe girls if they like adventure books.
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!,"""The place of Lions"" was so boring. I did not like this book for many reasons. One reason is because it didn't make any sense. At first the characters said the place was deserted and then they were going on the safari and said their were people swarming all around the place. Another reason is I can't picture this happening in my head and I like to be able to picture something happening in my head. In this book it took the author up until the fifth chapter to go on the safari. The just went so slow. When I went to pick this book out in the library I found it and read the back of it and I thought, ""this book sounds good"" but, don't just read the backof it because the book itself might not be good."
1,It is the worst book ever!!!!,At first i bought this book because i thought it was a survival book....but i read it and it couldn't even read till chapter fifteen.....don't ever read it!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Stardrive,"If there was ever a band which made music deserving of the genre title ""space funk"", Stardrive was it. Robert Mason, the central performer in the group, hand-built his own synthesizer when current models (early 70s) proved inadequate. This was a one of a kind polyphonic instrument, years before its time, and its uniqueness reflects in the music. No vocalists, no glitter, just supercharged space funk zipping along at warp factor 11. It's easy to imagine Stardrive as the house band aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise."
4,Director Walter Hill in Fine Form,"...Southern Comfort is... an interesting and action-packed movie from the prolific director Walter Hill. While it shares the same ""city-folk vs.backwoods dwellers"" theme as Deliverance, Southern Comfort is distinctive in its overall atmosphere of menace and foreboding.A group of National Guardsman on training manuevers in the Louisiana swamps are hunted down by [angry] Cajuns, and the worst part is, the weapons the Guardsman carry are loaded with blanks! The movie turns into a battle of wits and survival for the Guardsman, with civilization tantalizingly close by, but unknown danger standing in the way.I saw this movie as a kid, and I still remember it years later. I recommend this movie as a fine example of Walter Hill's lean direction and his unique eye for stylized violence, along the lines of Sam Peckinpah. It's also offered at a good price, so you can't go wrong."
3,a decent flick due to the actors involved,"There are some good actors here and that saves this a movie from a lower rating.however the flick is silly like alot of movies that are made about the military. This one has the lousiana gaurd out in the swamps acting like idiots for no reason. Shooting off blanks at people , let me tell you everyone in the guard knows you don't fire a weapon at people unless it's armed with live rounds. Then these goons come after them? ok, I give alot worse horror movies higher ratings because I have a horror movie rating scale , in truth most of them are two stars in comparison to a a movie. but this is a A movie , if it weren't for the acting I would give it two stars. It's ok for what it is though."
4,Undervalued movie,"In short, a bunch of National Guardsmen venture into the bayou swamps of Southern Louisiana. Whilst there, they upset the locals and find themselves hunted down one by one. Most are killed. Strange ending. End."
4,It's like Deliverance meets First Blood,"A simple 'in the midst of the video-store' review: ""It's like Deliverance meets First Blood (you know, the good Rambo movie).""A cast of B-movie actors turn in fair to good performances (with the occassional scenenery chewer). Paranoia, racial tension, and class warfair come to bare. Southern Comfort is not a great movie, but it is good. For those who appreciate something a little different, a little left of normal cinema, it's well worth your time and money."
3,Spike board,"Southern comfort star's one of the Carradine boy's, and takes place in present time as a group of ""Weekend Warriors"" (as Rambo put it) take their national guard selves on a trek through the Louisiana Bayou. As a training exercise they are led into the swampy marsh by a Vietnam Veteran, played by Peter Coyote (E.T., Cross Creek, Patch Adam's...). Loaded down with blank ammunition, and Marlboro Men attitude's, (as Ian Malcolm put it) they steal a few boats from some local swamp inhabitant's. As they paddle away, the owner's show up. Thinking it the smart thing to do, one of the soldiers unload's blank ammunition at them from his m-16. Of course, the rest of the movie is Louisiana Bayou resident's retaliation. I rooted for the cajun's, and liked it enough to buy it.(Only neat theatrical trailer as Xtra)"
4,Had to send it back!,This was a gift for christmas and I had to send it back..This was a VHS movie..It was not clearly marked so I ordered the wrong thing..I did not watch this so I do not know how the movie is..
2,A Vietnam set in Louisiana swampland,"Southern comfort is a great metaphor for the Vietnam War, except instead of the Viet-Cong, the enemy is some mean and nasty backwood Cajuns you would not want to run into if you were lost in the swamp. The soldiers are really a bunch of civilians thrown into an ugly situation they really want no part of, and they are impotent weekend warriors as well, as they have to fight the Cajun's powerful hunting rifles with nothing but blanks! Powers Booth, and Keith Carradine steal the show as the two soldiers with any common sense , that want to survive the situation...gory and violent, you really get into the story as their situation keeps worsening, and the plot thickens. The score by Ry Cooder is unforgettable and haunting, and listen for some down home Cajun music in the climax...will make you think twice about heading out into the bayous of Southern Louisiana....Highly recommended."
3,Inept National Guardsmen,"It's scary to think that our nation has guys like these defending our nation in their part time. Let's just hope they've increased the admission standards a bit. The dialogue is juvenile and crude, and the actors portraying the guardsmen look 40 years old!! The movie's saving grace is the music, rugged scenery and feel, and the cajuns. Not a thinking man's movie, but still pretty fun."
2,Worth watching...once,"I bought this DVD for 10 bucks a couple of years ago, watched it once and never picked it up again. Do yourself a favor and watch it on youtube before you pay what they are asking for it. A lot of people wrote some great reviews and delved deep into the inner meaning of the movie more so than I think the makers of the film did. Im glad I watched it but wish I had put my money elsewhere."
5,"Time to: "". .take a Pirogue Down the Bayou. .""","In another post-Viet Nam War statement, this is a movie that once seen, never leaves your mind. It leaves indelible impressions of a realistic horror man creates for himself. The realization of impending death that Louisiana Guard men come to--they must cooperate with each other in an attempt to survive by their wits, even though the prospect is highly repugnant to them considering their diverse backgrounds. The hanging slaugntered hog scene is nightmarish. Ry Cooders music is a perfect accompaniment for such bayou boogie-ing. Powers Booth always leaves an overpowering presence in his films and this is no different."
4,"Little known, but fascinating psychological drama!","This is a raw, surprising psychological adventure in which a group of weekend Army reservists deteriorates in terms of their organization, discipline, friendships, and trust in one another. It's like an adult Lord of the Flies!!"
3,Disapointed,"I ordered this DVD thinking it was a continuation of the T.V. show ""Rat Tamer"". I have The first one and when I received ""Life on the Inside"" the cover pictures were the same as ""Rat Tamer"" Went through all kinds of problems getting the supplier to answer questions regarding the content of this DVD. Had hoped it was a continuation of the program which ran about 10 in a serier on Australian T.V. Finally returned it as No response from the seller. Don't be fooled. Both Titles are the exact same program."
5,wonderful,The movie and the book are both wonderful. I can understand why some people may give them bad reviews if they can't grasp the subject matter. It's a message of love and forgiveness. What I don't understand is how some people think you are going to take their review seriously if they have not even seen the movie. People tend to hate what they fail to understand.
5,Faithful and true,"Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" is the movie of the year, a passionate account of Jesus' sufferings on the world's behalf that most certainly IS faithful to the Gospels. (Pay no attention to the pompous ""reader from Houston"" whose review headlined ""Short on facts, long on dogma"" challenges the accuracy of the King James Bible. Where are the footnotes for the research he alleges to have done? Pay no attention to anyone who condemns this film or the book who refuses to sign his/her name to their review. And certainly pay no attention to someone who comments on a book or film based on Scripture who then recommends some nonsense about aliens. Aliens are nothing more than demons - fallen angels - out to decieve the ""uneducated masses"" of whom ""reader from Houston"" is exhibit A.)If Mel Gibson's film moved you, the accompanying book will have the same effect."
3,it's great,"I think it,s a very interesting book for christians and also for people who like amazing biographies"
1,A waste of an opportunity to produce something good.,"I can't imagine why anyone would want a book filled with gruesome images- what purpose does it serve? I thought the film was very poor overall, totally missing the point, (assuming you believe that Christ was who he said he was, (that should be IS) and actually lived and died on a cross) I didn't think it was antisemetic per sec. Almost certainly it's not historically accurate but like some other reviewer has commented, a horror story, in Gibson's inimitable style. I can't imagine that Jesus was flogged to such a degree- he was nothing special to the Romans, just another regular execution. I thought the whole point of the story is the ending, which was glossed over very quickly- maybe not spectacular and violent enough for Mr Gibson.It was well filmed in a dark atmospheric way, but I didn't see the point of it being in Arabic. The film didn't move me atall. It should have done."
1,Finally SNUFF FILM STILLS! with class,"Finally a coffee table book for us Snuff Film Addicts.if You LOVE BLOOD and You LOVE GORE, You'll love this book. Fairly Dripping with bodily fluids and all under the guise of Christianity, What could be Classier!"
1,Biased & Untrue,"The book is not much different than the movie. It is a shame that Mel Gibson wastes his talent on presenting Catholic delusions from anti-semitic nuns as Truth. It is equally a shame that the best part of the Hebrew/Jewish teachings are left out to give more attention to the false idea of ""collective guilt"" no matter what is said about who is guilty. The story is written from a Catholic perspective and in that respect it is biased no matter how you look at it. In addition, alleged events that are recorded only in one gospel and not any of the others (why don't the stories match, did they all witness the same event?) are presented as the whole truth. If the movie was meant to bring more attention to the beauty of Christianity, I think it failed miserably. This movie will only satisfy the bloodthirsty who believe a human sacrifice complete with gory Roman bloodfest is the only method of salvation. The book leaves much to be desired if you have an open mind and a loving heart."
1,Falsehood,"As a citizen of Israel, I completely reject and condemn ""The Passion of the christ"". It is a work based on falsehood: Mel Gibsons work is heavely influenced by the writings of the deillusional mystic/nun Anne Catherine Emmerich.Furthermore, Gibson promised to remove all references to the line from Matthew 27. Although Gibson removed the English subtitle for the line, the words remain in the film, spoken in Aramic. Both the book and the film are falsehoods and should never have been made."
1,MELS MESS,"Mels movie and book are clear abominations with undertones of racism, hatred, and religious superiority. Neither the book nor the movie describe the events of the Bible as they are actually written. This is a diservice to Christians, and especially Jews, everywhere. I highly recommend not wasting your money, time, and good sense on Mels Mess."
5,He suffered and died just for YOU!,"If you saw the movie and felt like I did, this book will flood you with all those feelings again! When I saw the movie, I left like many others. I left saying, ""I am so sorry God"" and feeling totally shocked. Although I know that some details didn't follow scripture fully, I believe those were Mel Gibson's interpretation. But the main reason for the movie was to show you how Christ suffered and died for us. And I think Mel Gibson was true to scripture. Some people say, ""How could any man suffer through that much scourging"". Well, He wasn't a man; He was God in human form. Use this book to bring the scriptures to life in visual form. I think it will strengthen your faith as you are reminded what He did for you. Thank you God for sending Your Son, so that I may have eternal life."
5,AMAZING COMPANION TO GIBSON'S MASTERPIECE!,"This companion book to Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" recreates the startling imagery of Gibson's biblical masterpiece through an amazing set of pictures! With a powerful foreward by Gibson, and passages taken from the biblical account of the Passion of Jesus the Christ, this is the ultimate companion to the ultimate biblical epic! Grade: A+"
3,It's not as great as the show itself,"Well, what can I say? It's not the show. I think this is one of those shows you have to see, not listen to. It's a really fun show to do (I know, I've done it!) I have never much cared for Carol Channing's voice, so I'm not going to touch on that, but I do like this version better than the original. I think it lacks the luster of the original in a lot of ways, but that could be because the original is.....the original. I mean, what more is there to say? As far as the orchestra goes, it leaves a lot to be desired. There are some points where they are not quite with it. Actually, at points, I felt like I was back doing my high school shows. (Don't get me wrong, I loved those shows and would go back to them in a heartbeat, but they're not professional quality.) I'm all about the musicals, but this one? See it on stage and sing it to yourself. You can do without the soundtrack."
3,A great guitarist returns to his roots,"Rod Price, formerly of Foghat, returns to his blues roots with Shakey Vick, the vocalist he performed with before Foghat. Vick is an average singer and harp player, but that puts the focus right where it belongs - on Price's guitar playing. And he doesn't disappoint. The song selection is entirely covers of blues classics perfomed with a full band and electric guitars. And Price plays ALL the guitar parts. This CD will make your next party jump!"
5,good to the top,"i got this album in 95 when it first came out. i adore it since then, there's no flaw on it. the CD is still on sale & chipper with the time. by the next year atlantic released love somebody today; now is not in the market anymore. i guess i was lucky enough to make that ivestment on time."
5,Perfect,The CD arrived on time and was in perfect condition and I have been playing the CD almost everyday! I loooove it! Great job Amazon!
5,Kingd,This is one of the best album I feel that they release I love every track on this cd a must have for your collection !!
5,Disco Masterpiece enhanced,"Before this team-up with Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards Sister Sledge had some minor hits but We Are Family placed them on the map big time. They sound almost like a carbon copy of Chic on tracks like the exquisite He's The Greatest Dancer and Thinking Of You. The following songs were huge hits: Dancer, Lost In Music and the rousing We Are Family, all hook-filled tunes with irresistible rhythmic patterns. The rest is great too, especially One More Time and Somebody Loves Me which is a beautiful soulful ballad. The album has been enhanced by 2 x 1990s remixes each of Lost In Music and the title track. For more Chic magic, give the albumNorma Jeana listen and don't forget the mothership in the form ofDance, Dance, Dance: The Best of Chic. Read all about the Rodgers/Edwards legacy inEverybody Dance: Chic and The Politics of Discoby Daryl Easlea."
4,the 12 inch version kicks man,to hear the long version of we are family is worth the price alone nuff said.
3,Not bad,"If you are comfortable with the New Age and astrology you might find this book a suitable diversion. I enjoyed it for it's characters as well as it's not bad mystery plot. I found myself liking her unusual main character, quirks and all. Cute but not sugary."
3,good cd but mistaken,"I'M A HUGE FAN OF MCCOY TYNER'S WONDERFUL COMPOSITIONS AND WHENI SAW THE NAMES HERBIE HANCOCK AND CHICK COREA ADDED,I WAS EXCITED.I PURCHASED THE CD,COULDN'T WAIT TO PLAY THE CD.ALTHOUGH IT'S A GOOD RECORDING THAT ALSO FEATURES KEITH JARRETT,.IT WASN'T THE CD I THOUGHT IT WAS.I MADE THE MISTAKE THAT WE ALL HAVE MADE WHEN PURCHASING A CD.I ASSUMED THAT IT WAS ANOTHER CD,POSSIBLY REPACKAGED. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE SUPERIOR RECORDING ""LOOKING OUT"", ON THE COLUMBIA LABEL WHICH ALSO FEATURED HERBIE HANCOCK,STANLEY CLARK,CHICK COREA AND ON THREE SONGS,THE BEAUTIFUL PHYLLIS HYMAN.ALTHOUGH I WAS PLEASED WITH THIS CD AND WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY THIS CD,I'M BAFFLED THAT ""LOOKING OUT"", IS NOT AVAILABLE IN MCCOY'S TREMENDOUS DISCOGRAPHY."
1,THIS IS NOT A STANLEY,"This item is not a Stanley brand as advertized, also when I look into the gun part there was obvious residue of drywall; so the item is not a Stanley and also it is not new. Sending back for full refund. Other buyers beware."
1,Lesser Albion,"I have 19 other Albion Band albums in various configurations, with Ashley the only unifying element (of course), and this ranks at or near the bottom. I regret buying it."
3,Okay set,"I've had my set for almost 3 1/2 years. The pepper mill just broke, so I'm now searching for a replacement set. (There's a black plastic piece inside that seems to turn the peppercorns to move them further down into the teeth to be ground. That piece broke and the grinder no longer works very well.)The pros:- The top of the pepper mill unscrews to fill- you can adjust how coarse/fine you want your pepper- looks goodThe cons:- You constantly have to tighten the screw on the pepper mill to keep the grind where you want it (not really an issue for me, but may be for others...)- salt leaks out the bottom of the shaker- you have to fill the salt shaker from the bottom, meaning you have to cover the holes on the top to avoid spilling all the salt you're putting in- material is some sort of plastic, which feels cheap to meOverall, it's an okay set, but I think I will find a different set for the next ones I get"
3,Plastic parts wear out,"I've had these for a year and a half. They still look great, but the plastic parts in the pepper grinder just wore out and broke. I use it every day, though. This is a decently nice set for the price, if you go easy on the grinder."
4,Powerful Mud Mixer,"I bought the Goldblatt G15303 to mix wallboard compound. This mixer is better suited for mixing a full 5 gallon bucket of mud. I tried to mix a half bucket and it did not work well, too much splatter. You need a drill with lots of torque to turn this mixer at a low speed. Make sure you use the lowest gear on your multi-speed drill. I didn't and the my drill motor smoked as a result. I wound up buying a much smaller mixer which worked better for my needs. If you have a full bucket of mud and a drill with lots of torque, this mixer should do the job quickly."
5,A truly wonderful film!,This is defintly a great romantic film. It has a great story line and will keep your interest. This film was based on a book. Errol Flynn and Bette Davis are great in it. It's a kepper! Buy it and you wont be disappointed.
3,"Mormon/ Christian book, sort of","Great plot, fun read about a cop with a drinking, stress and eating poorly problem. His history, family,living situation etc... such GOOD writing, loved it! Character development and story line was just what I was looking for. Suddenly I noticed he was writing about the Bible a lot, and and the guy's partner was slowly converting him over to a believer. Which wasn't a BAD thing to do, but I frankly don't want to read that religious stuff. It was a clean book I noticed, no swearing or crazy naughty vice stuff that a normal ""cop on the streets"" would run into more (there was some). Actually kind of refreshing to read a cop story without the constant cussing, but the ""religious propaganda"" stuff made me put it away forever. Very disappointed because it was such a good story."
2,Am I reading a different book???,I'm not sure how my review can differ so much from the other people that have read this book. After 22% I quit. I don't have a clue where the author is going at all and don't even seem to really care about the characters. It sounds like a dysfunctional family (putting it mildly) and there is enough of that going around that I don't need to be hit over the head with it in a book I'm trying to read for enjoyment.
1,Disguised Christian fiction,"Once again, tricked into reading this drivel until the page where the preaching started (not that long into it, really). Deleted the book immediately. Amazon has GOT to do a better job of allowing us to filter out certain categories - and my first would be ""Christian Fiction""!"
2,"A ""Come to Jesus"" Book","I guess I didn't read all the reviews carefully enough before getting this book. I expected a good ""cop"" story, and it started out OK. The characters were well-developed, as was the basic police organization, so I was very optimistic. However, the action was slow. It basically focused on the disintigration of the protagonist, a cop in his 30s still living with his brother and sister in the family house. His police partner functioned as his guardian angel, and presumably brought him around to Jesus. ""Presumably,"" because after a number of pages of Bible study I stopped reading. If you like this kind of story, this is your book. But if you want action and an interesting plot, go elsewhere."
4,A Good Start,"I had just been in the hospital, and was looking for some good fiction. This wasn't bad. I understand that since Tony is a police officer, he is the type to notice details, but I felt the story, while good, was weighed down a bit with details. If he was hungry, we got the full run down of what was in his fridge, what he picked, and even what seasonings it had. It just seemed a bit overwhelming to me. As I say, the story was good, but I got lost at times in all the detail."
5,Review by someone who purchased it and uses it religiously,"I've used this carrier for the past 5 months and absolutely love it! I live in a large city and run my errands for 4-5 hrs at a time (walking and public transportation). My 10 month old goes everywhere with me. Here are couple of pointers:- Practice makes perfect - it might take a half a dozen trials before you find the right strap adjustment (you will know when your little one is too low). Start with the back/shoulder straps super short and lengthen until comfortable point reached.- Make sure your waist strap is comfortable (not too tight or lose). You should be able to fit a flat palm in between.- As they grow- shift your little one to a preferred side while sitting - that way they sit up and ""straddle"" one of your legs. Great when he or she is too small for a high chair in a restaurant and you did not bring a stroller.- Smile :) you look cool.Good luck."
1,Pure garbage that trivializes the great silent stars,"As a speculative story on the alleged events surrounding film producer Thomas Ince's death in 1924, it greatly disappoints, offering no clear or conclusive hypothesis and relying heavily on sleazy innuendo. It is rather sloppy on historical detail (e.g. Greta Garbo did not arrive in the U.S. until 1925, John Barrymore was in London rehearsing for Hamlet at the time of the alleged events.) What makes MURDER AT SAN SIMEON truly reprehensible, however, is its trivialization of the silent film era. Fascinating performers like Charlie Chaplin and John Gilbert are reduced to tabloid fodder. Poor Marion Davies comes off the worst here; Hearst and Biddle's hatchet job of her almost makes Welles's mockery of her in CITIZEN KANE seem complimentary. In order to fully appreciate and understand silent movies, watch films like THE GOLD RUSH and SHOW PEOPLE instead."
1,Murderous Mess,"I hate this book. The writing style and flow of thoughts the authors composed were fragmented. Annoying characters like Marion the dipstick, made reading torturous especially since she's on like every page - ""OOhh daddy poo!"", talking in her damn baby drivel. The heroine, Catha Burke was soo bland. She never affected me in any kind of way so having to read about her as she pursued the investigation was a bore. This book doesn't resolve some of the main reasons for reading the story, like who killed Thomas Ince, and is mostly flashbacks of boring snobbish parties with a lost heroine going nowhere."
1,Childish writing,"This could have been a crackerjack story if it weren't for thewriting. Both Ms Hearst and her co-author seem to have justgraduated from a sophmore English class and are putting whatthey have learned to use.The characters are cutout figures with no depth and are the sum ofall stereotypes in the early days of the film industry.I could only get through the first hundred pages, before itbecame unbearable to continue.I hope nobody wastes their money on this."
2,Murderous ending,"This book was reasonably entertaining, if not classic literature, until the end -- or, rather, the LACK thereof. After introducing all sorts of suspects and clues, the book doesn't even give a resolution. The main character, the story's sleuth, simply decides not to pursue her investigation any further. Thus we never find out who really murdered Tom Ince, or the identity of Mademoiselle X, or whether Abigail's death was really a suicide, et cetera, et cetera. Maybe this kind of ending is acceptable in an artsy, ""slice of life"" short story, but not in a whodunit. It left me feeling cheated"
5,Endless riches,"This is the first jazz album that I bought (1973), completely by chance, and the moment I listened to it, I knew that I was hooked forever. It sparked me to explore one of the richest forms of art ever to emerge from America.Only recently did I start to listen to this again, and I am astonished at the quality of the music. Truly it is one of the greatest jazz albums of all time. Though it was produced after the heyday of hard bop, it comes across as far more melodic and emotional than Charlie Parker, whose music had never spoken to me like this.Highest recommendation. This is the modern Mozart."
4,Individualism begins to melt away,"More stellar cuts from a truly inspired session Coltrane held in October of 1960 was perhaps overshadowed by counterpart MFT, though the quality on both nearly remain interchangeable...not quite up to anointed levels of his most provocative quartet days, but injecting a fresh edge into structural predictabilities so as to render them new once again."
4,COLORFUL AND HISTORIC,"Just another exciting Taschen product covering the offbeat and interesting. The ink and body art are colorful and I'm sure each tattoo has it own history/story. Tattoos are not for me, and the people involved are in the long haul for telling their life's experiences, who they were with, what they did, and even what they're planning for the future. Some of the art is magnificent and cleverly done...but I would always worry about the work fading out, the owner changing body sizes and shapes, and of course, what it would mean to others, some favorable but mostly negative, especially on the job or in a relationship. It appears it's not good to change lovers after your former date left a permanent mark."
3,Sasha's Opening DJ Gets His Break,"Jimmy Van M, the booking agent famous for making Sasha & Digweed famous in the USA, has apparently ridden their coattails to the top, on this, his first solo CD. He was been well rewarded. The cover art is splendid and the mixing is as flawless as anything you've ever heard mixed on a computer before. Although Disc 1 gets bonus points for its diverse track selection, Disc 2 sounds like it was rushed and is typical of the bizillion other compilations out there. In my opinion, just a lukewarm effort from some DJ getting payback, but there are often takers ripe for pablum of this sort. Now, open wide..."
4,"Bedrock, who would of thought...","I can't believe that John Digweed created the first bedrock album (which was great.....buy that too) and by that created a record label. Who would of thunk it, huh?Anyways, this is a pretty darn good album, considering what has come out of the electronic world these days .First disk is total housey beats with the usual trancey sound effects, but folks, IT WORKS. When people ask me what type of music I listen to I say ""Whatever sounds good,"" and thats what this sounds like, GOOD.ALthough the second disk is pretty riged in the ""Style"" department, it still does deliver good vibes. ""Trippy trance for the mind.....""So, if I had some money to blow on music right now and was looking for some good current techno, I would would deeply recomend this, ""Bedrock:Mixed and Compiled by Jimmy Van M"""
3,flowers for algeron,flowers for Algernon is based on the book by denial keyes about a man called(chary Gordon) who has the mental IQ of a eight year old! all that changes when he has a radical operation to increase his intelligence to genius level!! however the affects a only temperately. chary Gordon is played actor Matthew modine (full metal jacket)who does a great job to capture the character of charly. however the best by far was played by( cliff Robertson )in the 1968version called charly.rumour has it that (will smith)will be the next to play the role which am sure he will do a great job. i would also like to see Christean bail play him as well.
1,What's that smell?,"This does almost nothing for odor even at first...uh...use, despite its entertaining fizzy property. Buy Liquid Gold (not the furniture polish!) porta-potty cleaner/deodorizer instead."
5,"Interesting, if you're into that sort of thing","Nicely laid out, nice pictures, and each one has a little story. I'm not into ships, or canals, but one of the ships was named after a relative of mine, so I had to see a picture of it."
4,This is the one...,"This CD does indeed include ""Stars,"" ""Tragedy,"" ""King of the Mountain,"" and others. It's exactly as I remembered it...high-wattage Keyboard/Guitar Rock, along the lines of Journey.This CD is almost a classic, with at least one song - - Stars - - that I think is a classic."
4,A very rare pop rock gem from the 80's,"This was originally released on record and cassette in 1983,but it went out of print so fast that it never appeared on CD until it was re-released as an import.This album is very good all around.It sounds like a cross between Little River Band and Supertramp on steroids.Plenty of keyboards along with catchy hooks and melodies which is how a good 80's rock album should sound.The song,""Tragedy"" was the most popular hit from this album to hit FM radio back in the day.The rest of the album is pretty good.""Rock me Tonight"",""Wanted Dead or Alive"" and ""Stars"" also sounded good.One of the last albums of its kind to be made shortly before heavy metal became widely popular.If you are a fan of early 80's AOR style of rock,this is worth checking out if you can find it."
5,Never thought I'd see this one on CD...,"This is an amazing album by a group of studio musicians. Unfortunately, I believe this their only effort. STARS received airplay from the network during the Winter Olympics. Totally underappreciated group and album."
5,"Important, Intelligent, Heart-wrenching","Kirshenbaum delivers once again with her special blend of bittersweet romance, finely drawn characters and a protagonist for the ages. When Hester Rosenfeld comes to Munich to be with her older, intellectual German lover, and write his story, what follows is a complicated tale of love. Theirs is a relationship between people so simliar, yet opposite, with pasts that Kirshenbaum explores with dignity and hilarity all at once. Hester's observations of Munich, her investigation into her lover's life, and her independent yet devastatingly romantic spirit make her the perfect modern everywoman. This is a novel that tackles universal truths with a deft hand. Have you read Kirshenbaum's other novels? Start now and be forever grateful!"
5,Young American looking for a Germany of her own,"This perceptive and intelligent novel tells the story of a Jewish American woman setting out to find a Germany of her own. She falls in love with her subject in the shape of a professor of history born in 1943 and questions both him and his country to finally find truth -ultimately not about him, but about herself and her parents as well. Unlikely enough this story is a dark comedy - bitter and funny and heart-breaking."
3,Kirshebaum has an interesting voice...,"Hester Among the Ruins grabbed me from the get go. Binnie Kirshenbaum's writing was unlike any I had ever read before - the insertion of bits and pieces of letters, histories, and notes by ""the author"" was almost like an inside track to what Hester was really thinking or why she was thinking certain things through the course of the narrative.I had trouble really liking either character - both adulterous and selfish in their own ways. Hester's apparent dislike of her parents (and position as mistress) and Heinrich's endless womanizing make them not the most lovable people. However, Kirshenbaum makes you see past these faults and explores why people are the way they are.After reading through the first 2/3 of the book with gusto, I lost interest and steam for the last 1/3 and wasn't thrilled with what I saw as an abrupt ending. BUT Ms. Kirshenbaum has certainly found a new fan in myself and I look forward to reading more of her work."
2,Sprayer doesn't switch in less than a year,In less than one year from installation the faucet won't switch from spray to stream. I contacted Price Pfister and they wanted $86 for a part to fix it.
4,Just a basic level,"This is a decent tool for a decent price. I have many levels and I think this is the one with storage for bits, etc.?"
2,Can you say Cheeseyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,"The movie stargate was a little old but decent. It actually had a budget. The series is another story completely. Out of 3 family members who watched, all got bored within 2 episodes because the graphics, costuming and effects were so Cheesey! The digital age has spoiled us!"
4,SG1 the early episodes,"I watched SG1 on TV when it first came out and I loved it then. I must admit that it has lost some of it's attraction for me because I have seen the entire series and I don't care for some of the more recent episodes featuring the Ori, the story line went in directions that did not interest me so much. But these earlier episodes where they are still learning about where they can go and how the whole Star Gate thing works still hold my interest, that is why I decided to purchase the first season."
3,Emancipation,"I really expected this episode to be lame; as the idea of SG1 fighting for women's rights on an alien planet seemed an odd topic to form an episode around. Well Carter fought for women's rights and while good in nature, seriously put SG1 and their endeavors in jeopardy. She acted very self-centered in this episode and while everything turned out well in the end, her actions as a Captain were seriously irresponsible and selfish. Action wise, it was good and the plot turned out neat but I wouldn't want to watch this episode again!"
5,Stargate SG1 First season DVD Series,Everything arrived in perfect condition and ahead of schedule. We would defintly but from this vendor again. This fits in our collection really well. We are enjoying watching this series.
5,"Finally, It's here!!!! Stargate SG-1 the whole season","I wrote to MGM and alerted them that HBO had The Sopranos and Sex and the City, now Showtime has Stargate SG-1. I have been anxiously awaiting this and I am positive you will find this brilliant and possibility for endless episode series fascinating! With my favorite character being the Ruthless Villian Apophis, Earth may be facing total anialation if not for the Mighty SG-1 team with the help of Teal'c (the Jaffa who betrayed Apophis). You will get involved and addicted! I have been recording every episode on tape for 3 years now!! I finally have the DVD, or I will on May 22, 2001 !!!!!!!!!"
5,Wonderful,"Excellent continuation of the movie. Great actors to take over for Jackson and O'Neill. Hammond is a nice addition, as is Teal'c. Carter and Fraiser too. Exploration, mythology, investigating the universe... A fine addition to your dvd collection!"
4,"A few flaws, but well worth the money","Great storytelling, interesting charactization, and better acting than in much of the tripe pushed out to the big screen make for a worthwhile purchase.The picture on the DVD was a bit grainier than I would have liked--so grainy the picture quality was often poorer than VHS. It seems a great shame that MGM/UA would have let their original source material degrade that much. Also, no 5.1 audio option, grumble, grumble. Yet for this DVD collection to rate 4 stars despite the poor video and lackluster audio speaks volumes about the fact that these episodes are just very enjoyable science fiction stories."
2,xtra cheese please,"The acting and effects are good enough, the writting is very bad. I'm sure it gets much better in the following seasons for it to have lasted 10 years. Star Trek TNG was very cheesy in the early years and it ended up great after a while."
5,Zippin thru the galaxy,"Stargate SG-1 has become my favorite tv show. This new thinpak makes it easier to store several seasons worth of STG in a smaller space. I first borrowed my brother's copies of season 1-7 and it took up a lot of room and when I saw that a thinkpak would be sold and that it would be a tad bit cheaper, I jumped at the chance to start my collection. This show is science fiction at its best and is much better then the 'new' BattleStar Galactica (I myself prefer the original). The adventures 'off-world' are most entertaining and adventurous. I find that my favorite charcter is not one of the main one but is Dr. Frazier, the base doctor. I'm not sure what makes me like her character more then the others. In any case, I'm enjoying the start to my collection. Try one and you'll see that you'll get hooked just as easily."
5,Very good buying,"I liked it very much, will buy the next one..only problem there is no english subtitles also."
1,Amazon ships wrong set & terrible quality,"Firstly, be warned that if you purchase this ""NEW"" through Amazon, you will *NOT* receive the item shown (white cover) in the photo (or at least I didn't). Instead, you get a much older box set in a slipcase, with the older artwork, etc.Secondly, it's unfortunate that MGM has chosen to release such a poor quality set of DVDs. The picture quality is extremely grainy to the point that it seems like you're watching a VHS tape, during the dark scenes. This might have been fine 10 years ago, but for anyone who has become used to HD quality, you won't just be disappointed, you'll likely find your viewing experience far less enjoyable than you were hoping.Sadly, it appears that this is our only option for purchasing these on DVD, and it seems unlikely that they will get remastered soon, if ever."
5,A Perfect gift for any sci-fi fan,"The SG-1 series is terrific! I bought the box set for my husband, and am now hooked myself. Plot and character development are well done, as are special effects. At times it is funny, serious, though-provoking, suspensful....all around entertaining. I can't wait for season 2 to be released!"
5,I love this boxed set and feel sorry for the reviewer below,"First of all let me tell you that I'm a huge fan of Stargate SG-1 since its beginning and that this DVD is really worthy.The sound problems mentioned below are noticeable, but not if you calibrate your DD 5.1 Kit correctly. The only sound problem I had is Apophis' voice. To make it more impressive they put it in the surrounds. So I strongly recommend that you turn up the volume of the surrounds and the center.(but you should do that anyway for all movies)And about the interlacing-transition problem, it must depend on the drive you are using since I haven't had any problem with mine.And I must disagree with the reviewer below about the aspect ratio of the video. It's 16/9, it has been shot that way and hasn't changed.It's only the stupid people of Showtime that cut the borders!"
4,Captivating series,"I originally bought first the movie that started it all, then a set of 2 direct to dvd movies plus the pilot. That did it. I was hooked. I took advantage of a Black Friday and got the first three seasons. The rest is history... I might get SG Atlantis!The series has great character definition. All characters grow on you and the chemistry among the cast is evident. The visual effects still look good, even without considering this series is twelve years old. The stories are consistently good, with one or two duds, and I like the fact that many are stand-alone episodes, while keeping a defined storyline.Highly recommended, any science fiction aficionado would love to add it to her/his collection."
5,I <3 SG-1,This was a turning point in the series for me. Season 1 was sort of a letdown after the pilot episode for me until this episode aired. After I saw it on tv I fell in love with the show unconditionally.
4,Not its strongest,"The picture quality isn't the best and there are barely any extras on these DVDs. Also S1 is not SG-1's strongest. But from a collector's POV, definitely a must-have!"
4,"Good, but gets better later on","I had never seen a Stargate show during its entire run on TV, but I have always had a soft spot for sci-fi, so I purchased the first season when it was on sale. Admittedly I was a bit underwhelmed at first, I would have liked a more edgy show, something more like Firefly and not Star Trek. Still, from experience you know how it takes new shows a while to get their story line set up. I trudged on, watched the whole season although you have to suspend disbelief at many things...i.e. they obviously shot scenes from different planets from the same location on set...the scientists in SG-1 can easily kill/fight against trained soldiers who can't seem to hit anything standing in front of them. And when will Teal'c quit grimacing! ARgh.Richard Anderson made the show for me, so that helped each episode. I just finished season 2 and can honestly say it is much better. Overall, it is entertaining and interesting, with improvements as the season goes on."
5,Well worth it for the advid fan...,One of the best buys I have ever purchased. If you are a fan who could not be there to watch it on TV and who wants the widescreen format and DVD quality...this box set is a great buy. Some nice bonus features too.
3,Ok,All in all very good. Have seen them all before and watching them the second ot third time round seems to loose it's appeal. Still is a great box set at a good price.Could someone not produce the box set on other regions except region 1?
4,Singularity,"At first I was not liking this episode too much, was a little boring and I did not like the girl. Soon it picked up and there was some good tension and I was left wondering how the issue would be resolved. Good watch but I like action in my scifi!"
5,Best Show Ever!,"After coming on board during Season 3, I had to buy the boxed Season 1 & 2 DVDs to catch up. Now I find that the program will end after Season 6. Why all the hassle of moving to the Sci-Fi Channel with Season 6 just to end a great series? Pay MacGuyver and all the rest of them what ever they want. They could squeeze ten seasons, easy, out of this program."
2,STARGATE SG-1 SEASON 1 (ThinPack),"While the content of the episodes is excellent, it is not DD 5.1 and that hurts everything."
1,Very poor quality dvd,I am not one for writing reviews although I do appreciate those people who do. But since I have been a fan of this series since its birth I feel complied to to write and let anyone thinking of buying this DVD or any other season know that the quality of these recently released DVDs are terrible and the company really should be embarrassed selling them. I have recently had to split my original 10 season set so I am forced to keep the ones I recently purchased. And even then I had to return Season 1 because it had no sound. There are a lot of Stargate fans and more to come but if I were just beginning to watch the Stargate SG-1 series I am not sure I could sit and watch ten seasons of such poor quality DVDs.
1,BEWARE! Full frontal nudity on the first episode. Not for kids!,I purchased this product thinking it would be a good family series to watch with my children. I could not believe my eyes when in the middle of the first episode these idiot producers had to completely ruin the story with a totally out of place scene of full female frontal nudity. What were they thinking? This is supposed to be a prime time series. Please avoid watching this with children.
1,SG-1 is cool... MGM shafts fans...,"I am enormously disappointed in Season One, Stargate SG-1. I became a fan of Stargate during the 4th season.The main reason... the ONLY reason... why I am disappointed is that the last episode on the last disk is a ""TO BE CONTINUED"" episode. They did not include the episode in the Box set.3 Hours of TBC'ed on the last disk not to get the end? For $... I expected to see the last episode of Season one. Season one never airs, and season two is not out yet on DVD.Very disappointed about that.. What's even worse... I NOW I have to get Season 2. ....At least the Saprano's Box Set includes the last episode."
2,"Decent ""B level"" science fiction","Entertaining but not in the same league as Star Trek, the new BattleStar Galactica, Buffy, or Roswell. Never explained why every alien they meet speaks English, especially as language barriers were important in the original movie. Some of the acting is wooden, especially Teal'C and Carter. However, Jackson, O'Neil and Hammond are well-acted characters. The plot lines do not bear a lot of scrutiny."
4,"Good stuff, but Amazon isn't the cheapest","This box set is great, because I love the show. The only problem is there aren't as many extras as I would like, but what it has is still nice. (...)"
3,instant streaming out of order,"I really like the show, so for that I would give it 5 stars. But on instant viewing season 1 is out of order. Not a big deal because each episode can stand alone. But there is some thread through out. So if you are a prime member or instant viewer go by the dates for season 1 not the numbering. I appears the other seasons are in order"
3,"Not strong, but does advance the plot...","To be fair, while this episode does contain copious amounts of flashbacks, and was likely done to free up production money for the next two episodes, it does actually contain a good amount of fresh footage. The plot is advanced more than the other reviewer seemed to think, and more than I originally thought.Without this episode, you don't have a proper introduction to Senator Kinsey, which is a character that plays a strong part through the first seven seasons or so, and is a beloved and excellently executed role. There are some other minor plot advancements, but that one alone, as well as how it sets the stage for the later NID arc introduction and development, are worth viewing this."
2,Emancipation weaker episode,This is a stand alone weak episode and involves a primitive human species who enslave their women. Very uninteresting and irrelevant to the overall series.
3,"Great show, unspectacular DVD transfer","Although the content is there, the transfer to DVD could have been better. The sound is not up to snuff (in fact, the MGM logo sounds beautful, but the rest of the sound on the disc is noticabley quieter and not nearly as profound). Also, the image transfer could have been much better. Through many of the episode, the picture looks grainy--not sharp like DVDs should be. If it weren't for the fact that the show itself is very good, these discs from a technical standpoint are subpar.If you are looking for just the show, these will do. If you are looking for superior sound and picture--wait. Perhaps they will fix these or issue a recall, but the quality is not there. Hopefully in the Season 2 collection there will be a better transfer."
5,Far better than the film,"I bought the Stargate season 1 boxed set on a whim. It seemed a bargain for a season of television. It took me just over a week to blow through the entirety of season one. Stargate has easily become one of my all time favorite television shows. The writers do an excellent job of developing the characters, and keeping an ever growing continuity from tripping over itself. My only complaint is that three of the discs have 5 episodes on them which degrades the video quality somewhat. Had the episodes been spread out more effectively with 4 episodes per DVD, the quality would have improved. That said, the small lapse in quality is a miniscule price to pay for such an excellent serial drama. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,Finaly on DVD,"The set is great. The first season entirely on DVD, with great quality sound and Picture. Now I am just waiting for season 2 to be released."
2,Fuzzy filming,Not sure why the disk was so low quality. The picture was fuzzy and sometimes pixelated. I cleaned my dvd player and tried it again. still the same problem. so i tried it again on my other dvd player on a different tv. still the same problem.SG-1 is a wonderful tv series and would recommend the series to all sci-fi fans.
5,WOW! is the only term I can think of.,"Let me just say that I bought this box set soley on the reviews. I have cable, I have showtime and never was able to keep myself home to catch an episode, actually I am lying I cought one episode. So needless to say I was blown away, this show quite possibly could be one of the best sci-fi shows on right now. It has everything, action, comedy, and adequate special effects. They seem to tie in so many ancient cultures to Goa'uld's which is very sweet, and they do it well. Very rarely will you find any holes in the story line everything ranging from ancient greek to egyptian has been tied into the Goa'uld's plot to take over the universe and enslave the human race.September is still to far away, they need to release season 2 now."
4,Get the goods on an one of the best SF Series ever,"I enjoyed the StarGate movie, and was doubtful about a series based on the show. When the initial series came out on Showtime I didn't have access to it and then when it moved to FOX I caught it sporadically. Now, finally I've had the chance to start it from the beginning and this has been wonderful. Even more so when things in the current shows refer to events from the first season.WARNING! The last show is the season finale cliff-hanger and the second part is not part of this set! Until the second season was announced I could not recommend this set, but now you can get it and be assured of getting the next set as well.This cast works very well together and the show has a very 'classic' feel in terms of the types of things they address and the questions they raise. Some of the more outlandish shows are entertaining and they've kept the physics consistent (unlike say the X-files ;-). All in all I really enjoy these disks."
5,Glad to own it!,"With the death of the X-Files, this has become my favorite series.The pilot does a good job tying into the movie though they changed the appearance of the villains for the better in my opinion. They kept the two main chars from the planet so it was a small surprise to see them!It is a great series that has fresh new ideas!Finally, the main characters work well together."
1,5.1 Dolby Surround,While the cover for Season 1 clearly states audio is in English 5.1 Dolby Surround it is not true. The epsodes contain only stero sound. I was very disappointed by this. I already owned it and only purchased it again to get the improved sound.
5,What a great collection!,"Stargate SG-1 has become one of our favorite shows, so we naturally wanted to buy the season 1 and 2 DVD collections. Unlike something like ST:TNG, this show was great from episode 1 on- none of that first season trying to get into character or sub-par special effects. The storylines are well thought out, well written, well acted, and overall very fun to watch.The quality of the season packages themselves is high- very professional and well done. I would highly recommend both season 1 & 2 collections and can't wait for more of them to be released."
4,Stargate SG-1 Season 1 (Thinpak),"My daughter and I have enjoyed this series so far. There are a couple of places on the six discs that freeze but we have worked around those. Love Stargate SG-1 ! I like the ""thinpak"". It is compact and easy to store."
4,My mother loves it,My mother is addicted to this show. I started buying her the series for Christmas. She loves it
1,Concerned Parent,"Parents Beware! Although Stargate SG-1 is advertised as ""NR"" or ""Not Rated"", in fact, Episode One is rated - rated R for a scene of nudity. We purchased Seasons 1-7 for our family viewing and were shocked to find this out the hard way. We got no further then the first episode so we don't know if any other episodes are rated."
1,"SG1 Episode 1, Disappointing","The first episode is rated R, but the rest of the DVDs are PG. What made this disappointing is the frontal nudity within episode 1, thus our children aren't able to watch how the season began. Having watched all episodes buying them was something we wanted so that the kids could enjoy them. Rhetorical I know but, what is the value of releasing a R rated version of episode 1 when the PG-13 would be just fine? Tom PS: Episode 1 DVD makes for a great Clay Pigeon!"
1,Really...?,"I watched the first episode based on the reviews. You have to be kidding. This is so stupid and the production values are poor at best.I do not see why anyone would waste their time on such drivel. The plot is full of holes and the cast is given such stupid, inexplicable dialogue and plots that I wonder how they keep a straight face delivering the lines or performing the action. If you don't believe me, watch it yourself and see..."
1,mystified,"I had a lot of friends that were big fans of the show, so I gave it a chance and rented season one. I was mystified in that I couldn't see how it got renewed let alone become the cult hit it is.The production values were low, the characters lacking in charisma and originality, acting was mostly bad, and the writing was nothing more than knock offs of other shows. The only thing that seemed to stay amusing was seeing the aliens based off various forms of mythology, but it has been done before and this didn't break any new ground."
2,Mediocre Sci Fi Show,"I entered the realm of SG1 after being spoiled by the Farscape universe. I understand that SG1 is very popular (and I will try to give it a second chance) but the acting, the sets and the writing are horrendous. The show lacks intelligence and depth. The SG1 universe has great potential but this season makes me miserable as I watch the poor acting in this show. There is no chemistry between the actors. The closest analogy I can think of would be a simple comic book turned into a TV show. It is difficult for me to understand that the Sci-Fi channel keeps producing this junk while other more creative and deserving Sci-Fi shows (read Farscape) are terminated. The quality of SG1 (the first season) is truly mediocre (acting, writing, sets! Perhaps the other seasons are stellar (after all - the show is popular) but this first one certainly did not make me want to go there."
2,Not family television...,"The rest of the season, might be ok to watch as a family, but NOT the pilot. What is the deal with Hollywood ruining a perfectly good show with nudity? The pilot has quite a LONG scene that shows full nudity for quite a while. I fast forwarded it as long as I could, and had to turn it off. It was too much to see, even with the DVD player going in fast forward. Give me a break! All the reviews say Not Rated, with no idication of any other ratings. But if you look at the back of that disc case, once you get it home after buying it, it says rated R for nudity. I don't think people should be surprised with that content being in the movie. Why don't the websites say that in their reviews, so parents can know what they are bringing into their home. I will not keep something that filthy in my home, and am sure other parents wouldn't want it either."
4,A must-have for Stargate fans,You definitely get your money's worth. Season 1 provides the foundation for all subsequent Stargate episodes and the plot is better understood when you see the episodes in this set. I recommend it :)
5,One of the best SF series on television,"Very little to complain about in this set. I did find that the sound is a little odd in some settings,in one episode (#11 Fire and Water)the DVD pauses briefly ( maybe just a glitch in my copy), and I have noticed the mentioned occaisional grainy look others have reported. Yes it is shot in British Columbia (and every world SG-1 travels to looks like it),everyone seems to speak english (too impractical to come up with a new language each week), and only three human civilizations in the first three seasons are more advanced than Earth (all the others just sat still it seems). Even with this I've found the series to be one of the most creative and well thought out on television. I wish the following seasons would come out soon."
5,The New Stargate SG-1 Slimpacks,this will be the new slimpacks.about the same size as Stargate: Atlantis.this is great news for people like me that needs the space for other shows.they will be releaseing season 1-8 in slimpacks on June 13.
3,"Great series, but had a surprise in the pilot episode on the DVD",I loved this series and wanted to introduce it to my teenagers. I was caught off guard by some of the material included in the episodes that were not aired onTV. There is a warning that some of the special features include unrated material but not that the episodes do. There is a scene with females full frontal nudity in the pilot. Would have been nice to know that ahead of time! Made it a bit uncomfortable for my teenage boys (13 - 17) and 11 year old daughter who were watching it with me. Was it really necessary? The shot from the back gave enough of a message of what was happening we did not need to full Monty in a DVD that says it's rating is PG-13. Very disappointed.
5,Within the Serpent's Grasp,"Really good episode that I didn't want to end. Lots of twists and such so it turns out great. Lots of action too, especially when Daniel Jackson wields dual 9mm handguns and starts killing Jaffa!"
4,"I HATED the movie, but...","OK the maybe hate is too strong a word, I thought there were some good bits too it but plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. When it was announced that Richard Dean Anderson was making a TV version of it in Vancouver I thought "" Eygpt in Canada, riiight..."" But it at least MacGyver was working again.Then I caught a marthon of the first season on a Showtime free Weekend. I subscribed to Showtime the next day.Not the perfect show, but it is funny, exciting, doesnt take itself too seriously and the cast and SFX are very good. It is the best example of what is increasingly rare on TV, a good adventure show.Season 1 sets the pace for the increasing better seasons, topping out at Season 4 I think. IT is still a fine show, better then 98% of the stuff out there ( and FAR the best thing on Sci-Fi Channel currently).Besides, it has MAcGyver in it! How can you say no to that?"
1,NO available info on content,Hard to find anything about the content of this publication or more about the publisher. Printed only twice a year at nearly $6.00/issue and yet nothing to describe the publication itself.
3,What happened to the original version?,"I recently purchased this movie and found that it has a different soundtrack than the original version. What happened to the song ""The Shag"" and others that were in the first version? I don't understand why the original version was changed, but it needs to be released!"
5,VHS with same cover as DVD seems to be the original version,"I have the VHS tape with the same cover as the DVD, and have not had the issues that the DVD owners mentioned of the DVD being different than the tape. It has all the original songs, etc.Love, love this movie!"
5,Awesome,"Great. The movie was great, received it very fast and I am very happy with my purchase. I will use again in the future."
5,"I Fancy ""Shag""","This movie was probably greenlighted after the success of ""Dirty Dancing"". All I can say is this movie has it all over that slick article. What I like about it is that it feels real. You're transported into a time and place and it feels authentic. In this case it's Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in the Summer of '63 and what I like is that this film does not resort to cliche in depicting the South during that turbulent time in our history. The four leads are full-bodied characters written and performed wonderfully nonesomuch as Annabeth Gish as Pudge. Only through some plot contrivance would you consider her fat. Her performance at the shag contest is ebullient and puts Jennifer Grey to shame. I thought the music in the film was great but it's been pointed out by other reviewers that some of the songs have been deleted and substituted. I guess that would be my only debit to an otherwise perfect flick."
2,I Bought This DVD For Phoebe...,"Like a lot of budget MGM DVD's being released (Elvis Presley's ""Charro"" is a good case in point - go read the reviews on that MGM release), the picture quality of Shag sucks. That's why only two stars. My Sony WEGA TV has 4 picture settings and I tweaked the Vivid setting to make this DVD watchable. Phoebe Cates and Annabeth Gish were great. The movie itself was fun, but I don't recommend that you buy this DVD unless your a big fan of Phoebe or the movie."
5,Shag,Great movie. The movie was based on a weekend at Myrtle Beach. I have visited Myrtle Beach numerous times since I was a small child so I could relate to a weekend with the girls at the beach. That made to movie even more special for me. Loved it.
4,The Summer Of 1963,"This is my first time seeing Shag and it was pretty much alright. The music, dancing and girls in bikinis were, at the time, the chemistry for this comedy-drama. For those who like 1960's fun and troublemaking, I suggest All I Wanna Do and Hairspray."
2,Jesse and Frank James: The Next Generation,"'Shag' is a typical 80s teen movie (set in the 1960s) and an OK way to pass the time on those terms. However, it does give the audience a chance to see Tyrone Power's son and Henry Fonda's granddaughter in a movie together- the two great stars who played outlaw brothers in the classic 1939 Western, ""Jesse James""."
5,FABulous!,"I watched this movie with my mentor group and we had a great time bonding. It is a total ""chick flick"" and it is all about old time love, romance, dance, and feeling good. So much fun! I love it. There is a character to symbolize each of your crazy chick friends."
5,Shag deserves more credit!,"I have loved this movie since it came out when I was in junior high. It is a great movie about friendship and fun, two things that are very important in life. I can't believe this movie wasn't more popular with the public. It is a great ""feel good"" movie. (And the boys aren't bad to look at either!)"
4,Great chick and chicklet movie,"I first viewed this movie on cable. Watched it over and over. I tried to purchase it previously (thru another venue), was advised that it was out of print. Hows ever... the movie is cute and innocent enough for my daughter (chicklet) to watch. The demeanor of the four friends represent something seldom seen today. Good teen and tween flick."
5,A moive worth owning,"Now that I have read other reviews I am so glad to know that I am not crazy. I, too recently purchased Shag and noticed that the music was different from the original version. However, this movie is still worth owning. It makes me proud to be from South Carolina."
4,Either you get it or you don't,"I won't claim that any of those coming of age, end of summer beach movies were cinematic masterpieces and this one is no exception....but it was pretty fun for what is was. I don't understand the editorial review ripping the title as ""dumb"". The title was perfect and fitting. It's named after the Carolina Shag, which is the name of the dance that Pudge and her partner do at the talent contest. Naming a 60's period movie set in Myrtle Beach, SC after the Carolina Shag is not dumb at all. It makes perfect sense."
3,Different soundtrack??,"its the same movie I remember.. only half the songs are compleatly different.. It kinda changes the whole feel of the movie. I used to own the vhs version but I moved and don't have it anymore so i thought i would buy it again on DVD, only this version i don't like. I fell in love the the whole movie including the songs and this just doesn't do it for me.. If I never had the movie before i guess i wouldn't be able to tell the difference, only i memorized the vhs version and before I even got this on in the mail I was already singing the song's i remembered.. I guess I was just let down and dissapointed that they changed the soundtrack when the changed it to dvd. :-("
1,It is IMPORTANT that you get the ORIGINAL on VHS,"I love love love this movie, but you have to make sure you get the VHS version (where the VHS cover is the cast riding in the car.) Lucky for me, this is the one I own. By mistake, I purchased the ""wrong"" version for a friend and we sat down to watch it together. The music in the DVD version is TERRIBLE compared to the original (don't even get me started on the c.d. soundtrack.) Whoever made the blunder of re-doing this for DVD re-release needs to be fired!"
5,a modern hero,"Jerome Lejeune's daughter shares what it was like to grow up with a brilliant research doctor (the first to discover the chromosomal ""signature"" of a genetic disease, Trisomy 21 or Down Syndrome) who deeply loved and respected his patients and their families"
4,It does the job,"This stand raises my monitor to the prefect height. I have my 15"" MacBook Pro on a laptop cooler inside the stand. If you use your laptop primarily as a desktop then this set up works well. But if you remove the laptop often, it's kind of a pain plugging in (and unplugging) all the cables (monitor, usb, headphone etc...) when the laptop is inside the stand. If you have the desks pace, it's easier to keep the laptop outside the stand."
5,Perfect stand,I have a hard time finding the right height monitor stand. This Targus stand is perfect. My laptop fits under the monitor on a pull out draw. Love using this product!
3,"Works, but not perfect","The stand is decent style and height. My probably is the sliding shelf. First, the stand is so light that it's hard to pull the shelf out without dragging the whole stand with you. And the opening is not wide enough to be able to fit my Lenovo T410 and it's docking station. I can get it in there, but I cannot slide the drawer all the way out to do it because it hits the posts. I guess I'm spoiled with my IBM one at work, which works great, but that was 4-5 times the price. You get what you pay for. I don't use it enough for it to be that big a problem."
4,Nice but not that great,"Yes, it is adjustable but only in certain steps. Kinda like a stacker where the fewer pieces you stack the less height you get. but otherwise this product offers what it sells. No more no less. Not a fancy stand that we see on some expensive catalogs but definitely worth the money. Pretty sturdy too for a laptop at least."
1,Inaccurate discription,This stand was returned because the description said it would hold up to 50 pounds. It would not hold that nor anywhere near that amount of weight.
2,It works but...,"First, the unit does work. However, for the price I expected more like higher quality plastic, a better track system, etc. Given that you can buy a wireless mouse and keyboard for less this item is definitely overpriced."
3,Harlequin,"This is probably Harlequin's best album. It contains 2 of their best songs, ""Innocence"" and ""Thinking of You"". This is a good first Harlequin album to start out with."
5,THE Barista's Bible,"What a fantastic book for the experienced and aspiring baristi. At the coffee shop that I work at all the staff are required to read this book and for good reasons too. It goes over the essential components of what makes good espresso, such as:-Roasting methods-Proper storage of the beans-Burr grinder settings and maintenance-Espresso machine temperature-Proper dosing, distribution, and packing techniques-Machine cleanlinessAnd that is only a hint of what Schomer has to offer as far as pulling the perfect shot of espresso goes. After reading this book through my shots have improved tremendously.The author takes his coffee very seriously so if you aren't that serious about coffee then you may be a bit intimidated or weirded out by his enthusiasm.But for fellow coffee geeks this book is golden!"
3,"Great Book, price on back of book $27.95! NOT $88+","Very informative book, he's got it down to a science.All these prices for a paperback are way out of line! I found this true with other books offered through Amazon as well. Do your research, get a better deal somewhere else."
5,Espresso Coffee: Professional Techniques,Excellent book. A tutorial that is very clear and easy to understand. The author knows his subject very well and explains the processes in a step by step fashion. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to make top quality expresso coffee.
2,NOT the book,Extremely disappointed by the SHORT length and cursory information of this video.The barista knows his stuff. Better buy his book.
3,It's ok,I read rave reviews about this coffee so I had to try it. Brewed it exactly like the instructions says to do and it was meh. The coffee did not have a rich flavor but more of a slightly tangy taste to it. I'll stick with Starbucks!
3,Overpriced,"We only drink Cafe Du Monde in this house. In a pinch, I ordered this because I hadn't realized we were out and I have Amazon Prime so it would come in time for Thanksgiving for free. I would recommend purchasing through Cafe Du Monde, because this was massively overpriced. I paid $17 for 2 cans, but they cost like $6/can directly from the company. However, if you need it right now, this is a good choice."
5,This is my favorite coffee...,"and I can't always find it in my local stores. You really can't beat this pricing, either."
3,As Opposed to CDM,"I ordered a couple of bricks of a Coffee labeled CDM with the same color packaging as this. I just wanted to see if they were the same. They weren't, and I did like this better than the French Market"
5,Excellent product - better than others we've tried!,"Helped my husbands severe rash that he'd had for several months when prescriptions and all other treatments didn't touch it. We sprayed it on topically and then blotted with cotton balls to really get it into his skin. When he began taking 1 tsp twice a day the improvement really escalated. We noticed marked improvement within several days and then it did take another few weeks for it to heal but this product really works. My husband continues to take it orally as a preventative of a recurrance and I take it at the first sign of a cold, flu, or sore throat. I just ordered two more -"
5,Must have!!!,"Works well. Saves you money. Avoid most costly and time consuming doctor visits. Helps heal cuts, infections in 1/3 of the time."
3,Does the Job,"I am still evaluating the and researching the product. It seems to do the job, but I feel it will take a long term to get a good handle on it."
1,Use only If Auditioning for The Blue Man Group,"For those considering purchasing this or any other ingestible product containing silver, I give you Stan Jones (politician), and a new word: Argyria. Please Google both and look at the photos. There are some cures that are worse than death."
1,Dangerous,"Dangerous product! Please do your research before taking colloidal silver, as this can do permanent damage."
3,"Natural Path Silver Wings Dietary Mineral Supplement, Colloidal Silver...","Works, but not sure if it works as I would have liked with the price of the product. I think I would have liked it to work a little better with less product used."
2,Is it supposed to taste terrible?,The taste is horrific and it turns my mouth and teeth yellow...lol. Sometimes I swish it around my mouth diluted with water and smile b/c I look silly.
3,This product is usually good!!,I use this product on a regular basis. I know that it's good. But this particular bottle I received tasted old. I'll just pay the high price at the store rather than gag on the cheaper mail order brand.
2,"Ok, could have been better quality",The cd would only play in certain cd players. In most of my cd players the cd would skip. When I looked at the cd itself it had a film on the back like someone tried to repair the scratches. Would not purchase from provider again.
3,A bit immature for Gospel rap,"My first gloss-over of this album was a good one...he has some exceptional beats and rhyming ability going on with some of these songs. However, his lyrical content is so immature that I couldn't ignore it. He manages to repeat over and over on this album about all of these 'haters' who said he couldn't make it, and 'look at him now.' Granted, a lot of gospel rap has songs like this, but there's a bit too much of it in this album for my liking. It's unfortunate too, as this should have been some extremely good stuff.As for 'looking at him now,' we're still waiting for that sophomore album =P"
5,"Like fire, like air, the real music always make you free.","Listen this record made me a great shock. It has all that the real music wants to be. Movement, Feeling, Freedom and the conception of a music master. You have the oportunity to listen a masterpiece."
4,excellent,"This is really juice prog from a band far better than ELP or Yes. Somehow, the best of the best of the era--most of whom were on Vertigo--never got the love the cheese prog did.Sacrafice does have some nice keyboard work, but it is artfully placed in contained songs, not psudo-classical octane. You have to adimire this, along with the flute-peppered, and primal, blues.And just when you are getting into the music, a voice increases in volume to a march: ""Hail to the devil, hail to the devil, SATAN'S HERE"" Of course it is all horror cream, and very funnyBut it also may have been the point when FM 1970 acid pilots looked at their friends, chuckled in fear, mid-trip, saying......""OK BROTHERS AND SISTERS. CROSBY STILLS AND NASH TIME."""
2,Obscure piece of prog/occult,"Worth having it as a reference - that's why I bought it. Ideas & thoughts are more interesting than music (and much more than singing). Interesting as a piece from the 70s. Has nothing to do with ""Black Sabbath"", and doesn't even come close - don't trust the editorials, adverts and reviews (the band started its life as pretty uninspiring Pesky Gee -Exclamation Mark). On the other hand, get the 3rd and 4th albums - you won't regret it.""Black Widow"" was one of the first bands to try to cash in on occult, witchcraft and black magick subjects - pre-dated by ""Coven"" (Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls) and ""Zior"" (Zior."
5,We love this series,"Love, love, love these books!!! We have been reading these books to my daughter since she was 3 years old because she is curious and asks questions about everything! Each book has great detail and information about the topic of that book. The characters make learning about science fun and exciting! Definitely not a bedtime book because the books generate even more questions from your child. Great way to encourage interest in science! My wife and I have even learned from reading these books to our daughter."
4,"My 8 year old son loves these books. Cute read, yet informative.","All I can say is my eight year old son loves these stories. The stories are cute, yet informative as a learning tool."
3,Hayley's outrageous review,"At the start of school the kids do not like Miss. Frizzle, because Miss. Frizzle is not the type of teacher that will bring you to the zoo, but she takes them on trip to weird places. She made them look up waterworks in the library for a month. Will they go on the trip or not? This book is good for all ages!"
3,"good book, bad printing","Although the book itself is very interesting, it was mis-printed in a very odd way. The beginning of the book was printed at the end, upside down. So, when you open the front cover, you hit the middle of the story."
4,Outside-the-box world fusion and jazz fusion potpourri,"There's good fusion style jazz here and more. I think the predominant sound is more Japanese than Hawaiian, but this program is borderless with Spanish, Peruvian, Indian and many other sounds. I enjoyed their own vocal composition ""Sweet Lili of the Valley"" for Queen Lili'uokalani. Many of the selections are their own compositions. Others will be familiar from other contexts like Coltrane and (I had to laugh) Hendrix, Santana and Sting. As a whole this is delightful, honest, easy to listen to, and fun."
3,Atlantis,The Atlantis movie looks totally awesome! I can't wait to see it. I got the hardcover version of the book because I really wanted to see the movie. I was dissapointed at this book. It is bare bones writing with hardly any details. The pictures aren't that great ethier. The reason I gave this book 3 stars was because I liked the story line.I would not recomend this book unless you really want to see Atlantis.
2,Falls far short of expectations.,"With all the action-packed thrills promised in Atlantis, you'd think the people making this flipbook would have added some really impressive shots. Instead, we have one shot of a ship exploding, and then the ATlantean guardian, dubbed the Leviathan, rushing towards us, and a flip side flipbook image has an image of mechanical vehicles rushing past. Definitely not worth the $4 price tag, more like $1.50."

5,Definite Page-turner!,"This book will appeal to both men and women alike. There is enough mystery and adventure, romance and humor to cover the gamet of every genre. I read a book just about every day, and this is not a typical book for me. However, I found it wonderfully fun and the twists are great. I hope this author continues to put out such outstanding reads!"
3,Ripstop material - not Denim at all,"If you're expecting denim, you're in for a surprise like I was with these. I also order a pair of blue denim in addition to these in dark green, and I like the regular denim much better.The design is perdy cool actually, and the fit is just right. However, this material seems like it needs to be ironed, it's very wrinkly IMO. And this material also seems to attract pet hair moreso than anything else I wear.They do seem very durable and will likely last me a long time, whether camping, fishing and hunting, or just for yard work around the house."
4,riggs,"Since rec'g and using they have been great, but I have to admit they make more noise when walking as per a previous review."
2,Poor fabric quality and fit.,These pants are definitely not Carhearts. I guess you get what you pay for. Mine came with a small thread tear in mine and it looks like that is the spot where it is going to open up and form a hole. Also the fit is off. They hang way too low from the crotch and look like the pants my father used to wear 40 years ago.I will not be wearing these very often. Definitely not for work.Bill
5,Sturdy and comfortable,"These are work pants and they stand up great to hiking in the woods, working on the farm or even going to Church. I gave up blue jeans completely for these pants, and I have not been disappointed at all. The multi pockets are very handy, especially since I don't have to keep my wallet in my back pocket any more. The color in the pants stands up great after several washings, with only slight fading.....I prefer to wear mine with the faded look anyway. No problems to report with the zipper or any tearing. I have worn these pants through thick brush and brambles and they stood up great to the thorns, no tears rips or pulled threads. I spend a lot of time digging items up while metal detecting, and the knees hold up fantastic, even after kneeling on the concrete edges of a sidewalk."
1,Ripstop my ass,"These jeans ripped the first day I had them, I sewed them up to make them last at least a little while and the freaking zipper broke. Total garbage, what happened to the good clothing manufacturing."
1,Excellent Jeans for 3 months,"These have 9 heavy duty belt loops. The size and length are accurate. The material is a little stiff - towards canvas - only washed once tho. Very little shrinkage. Not as soft as old blue jeans, but feels armored. Much more rugged. I am buying another pair - different color.UPDATE: Its been 3 months since I bought the Jeans and the zipper broke. I wasn't even wearing them at the time. In hand, I tried to unzip all the way down and it was hung-up. Zipper teeth section pulled right out. Very disappointing."
5,More durable than bluejeans,"Working on my knees while on roofs and concrete,Riggs held up for a longer time than jeans. In the end, they get abraized but did not tear."
4,Who Knew Saga's Hits Were So Great?,"I grumbled about buying this collection for just one or two songs, but the disc is packed with great hits I didn't know were Saga. Good job, and I dig the handsome packaging."
4,Bought it for two songs,"Saga... One of the unsung REAL one-hit-wonder-flock-of-seagulls-wannabees-bands of the 80's. I had SO forgotten all the other underground stuff from the band, but I really did only buy the album for two songs: Wind Him Up, and On the Loose. Neither disappointed, especially since I hadn't heard anything but crappy MP3's since the early days of Napster. I really missed all of the other stuff too, I just didn't remember, until I heard them all again!I simply can't find anything wrong with the album... The recording quality certainly reflects the technology of the day, but the track selections are really some of the best stuff the band ever did. I can say that I do, indeed recommend it."
1,Weird movie,My husband and I really didn't like this. It got some good reviews so we thought we'd give it a try and I'm upset that I wasted my money on it!
1,They Can't Show Enough Skin to Make This One Appealing,"Ugly people having sex, smothered in tattoos. No, its not a hardcore porn movie. It inhabits the middle distance between hardcore and soft core porn. It is the kind of movie that businessmen pay $4.00 to watch in the privacy of their room at the La Quinta while on a business trip. Erections sans cumshots.Ask yourself why David (Eric Balfour, a greasy, unattractive dude) would leave the only attractive woman in the movie, Victoria (played by Polly Shannon) for someone as just this side of ugly, Leila (Lauren Lee Smith).Like most faux art movies, sex moves the plot, rather than the plot incorporating the sex in a meaningful way. The ""actors"" mumble their lines which are worthless dialogue anyway and not worth hearing.I would not only add a parental advisory for this film, but would also add the following: ""This movie is for immature adults only. Viewer discretion advised and your self-esteem is at stake."""
1,I just found it boring,I thought the plot was weird and really did not enjoy the movie. I turned it off halfway
1,Quality dvd lie with me. sender is good,"whenever I purchase a product from Amazon, I always make sure the I know what I am buying. Therefore this review is not about the product that I purchase but on the people who sold the product to me. Yes I am indeed happy and satisfied of the seller. This pertains to the DVDs Hollow Man, Lie with Me and Havoc and of Love and shadows"
3,ehhhhhhh.....,"I really love the guy in this film. he's really handsome, so him taking his shirt off was pretty exciting for me. haha. but honestly that's about it. The love scenes were really strange. she's a strange girl. very pretty but strange. I didn't understand it at all. I even watched it a second time. Still didn't get it."
4,I loved it...but it was raunchy.,"i randomly flipped to this one day on showtime and at first i was horrified. It was hard to tell if it was porn or not. but once i watched for a couple minutes i became so intrigued by the plot and characters.yeah, its pretty graphic but the story is deep enough for an eighteen year old like me. It feels extremely realistic with its own unique feel, and while it has its cliche romantic moments it blew all other romance movies away.honestly the only reason it lost a star was because it was way over-sexed."
2,"boring , one viewing actors suc","much hype it doesn't deliver, i am a fan of the movie ""the lover"" and ""lotita"" i was in the mood to see a good erotic film but this one quite a bore, filmed very well though worth a viewing...rent please!"
2,"without Love, sex is meaning less","which pretty much desribes this empty film that is too thin to be an art film, and no enough story to be a mainstream movie either."
3,Interesting premise that fails to deliver,"The worst part about this movie? It's dull. It's essentially a movie about sex, or a sexual relationship, but in large part the sex scenes aren't interesting enough to hold your attention.The premise, though, is what nets this three stars instead of two: here's a woman, probably not unlike many other women, who separates her emotions from her sexuality. Then she meets the protagonist and things change for her.So that's the jumping-off part...problem is that there isn't enough substance wrapped around that really to hold the viewer's attention."
3,Not bad!,"Surprisingly this movie was quite good. Anyone that watches it will see that the movie is very watchable. It's very sensual hense the title. My opinion, women would enjoy this movie."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I rented this movie expecting a love story, but got something very different. It doesn't even deserve a multiple paragraph review. I'll keep my reasoning short but sweet: It's basically an incredibly weak story with semi-pornographic material. If you want an entertaining story, this movie is not for you. But, if you want soft porn, then go right ahead and rent it. Either way, I was extremely disappointed."
2,Not a great one,"I commend the director, producer(s) and actors for being daring. It would be great to see risks of thematics and/or action (no pun intended) in other even mainstream movies -- ""Closer"" was close, but J. Roberts never, ahem, bumped or grinded on screen. Unlike ""Closer,"" the dialogue in this one was LAME."
4,Lauren Lee Smith fans only,Basically this is a thinly veiled good movie with some sex scenes which are the main drawing point for Lauren Lee Smith fans. Not much plot to this film but mainly it is a cult following type movie of fans of Lauren Lee Smith. If you remember Mutant X you will know why Lauren Lee Smith has her following of fans and this film doesn't leave those fans in the cold. Essentially this film is fluff more than anything but to Lauren fans they will enjoy the thin plot and heavy use of sex scenes to tell her story.
3,a hidden desire to search for true love.,"in this movie, the two actors met in a party. later, thefemale lead showed off her bold desire for sexual enjoymentunder a varieties of situations-including a live show in front ofothers.her live-show triggered the male lead's curiosity tosearch for her. their consequent sexual endeavors became moreemotional as well as physicial. however, for the male-lead, itbecame much more emotional.it awhile for the female-lead toseach for own personal meaning in life.this movie shows thatpeople and things can change. the future is clean for most of us."
2,He's a 10,"Director Clement Virgo brings us a romantic look at sex and perhaps true love found in the realm of exhibitionism. The first time I saw fellatio in an american independent film was in Vincent Gallos's ""the Brown Bunny"" Now it seems director's use oral copulation scenes to imply that the rest of the sex, which this movie has lots of, is real as well. The story is very simple and soap opera like, but just watching Eric Balfour with his perfect body, naked, makes this film a work of art."
1,Starts off great but runs out of steam fast.,The show starts off great. Lauren Lee Smith for the first half hour is bewitching and hard to take your eyes off but then... it's over... by the end of the show she's just another whining jealous ex-lover pining away for her man.I have to give Eric Balfour a lot of credit for his lack of modesty. The scene where he is dancing naked with Smith needed a George Costanza voice over explaining the affects of shrinkage.All in all a horrible film and big waste of money.
3,So so for my first...,"I got this as my first ""lets-watch-a-sexy-movie-together"" and chose this one since it seemed to be so popular. I have to admit, I thought it was kinda lame. I mean, it was ok, but I was really hoping for more than what it was!"
4,Good indie film.,"For the a used DVD,it looked new,no scuff marks.As for the film: you can easily get lost, but good realistic storyline."
5,Awesome movie!,This is an awesome movie with a unique storyline. The lead male character is outstanding and delivers an extraordinary performance.
1,"this did not play, i have seen the movie and loved it, just disappointed that it didn't work",i wished that someone would have mentioned that the UK and the US have different formats for the DVD's i wouldn't have ordered hit had i known/
3,jj,I liked it however the GF wasn't as thrilled with it. Too predictable for her to watch the whole thing.
1,Lie with Me,"Boring, Boring, boring!! She needs to eat something and get a new wardrobe. Do something with your hair so you at least look good!! He was ok."
2,Poor story line,"This movie has a fair share of nudity, but a weak story line that I won't waste time to relate. Enough said"
2,Not much different and not worth the time,"This movie really disappointed me in that it did not say anything different, especially if you have seen this typical scenario where a woman is promiscuous and hits on a man, gets obsessed with him and that is it, then don't waste your money. As for the supposed sensual, erotic ratings I have read here, I did not see it. The scenes were very well guarded from view for the most part and not at all stimulating. Don't waste your time or money (even to rent this one)."
2,Stupid movie,"It is a very stupid movie, no depth into it, no meaning at all to the movie, very stupid story."
3,Lie With Me,"It was not at all what I expected, but for an independent film it's alright, it has a storyline, not a very interesting one but none the less a storyline. If your looking for a John Holmes type of film, this one is not for you, by the way side note a lead character also was in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 1."
5,The Acid Test,Thought it was good when I saw it first time at a friend's house.Knew it was great when I took it home. My aged (46) padre couldn't watch. Said it made him nervous. YEAH!
4,"Ozzy, Lemmy, Galaga","I don't know if I'd go so far as to say this was a ""classic"" but it's definitely a must see for any rock fan, or any documentary fan. It's like a post script to the movie ""Decline of Western Civilization Part 2"", it's even filled with a lot of the same characters: Lemmy, Ozzy, etc. While Ozzy is great to watch as usual, what made it really worthwhile was the boat load of not famous Sunset Strip characters peppered throughout. I mean, ""Lucifer Satan"" and the tatoo parlor ""rebel"" are straight out of Spinal Tap."
2,"Not Great, Perhaps Okay","I found most of the characters in this book completely unbelievable. The dialog was horrible. There was potential with the storyline, but it just disappointed me in the end."
3,Not really Brother DRM quality but what can you expect for the price?,"The first version of the drum I was sent was flimsy and looked like it had been shaved with a razor blade. It also had stickers on it to make it look new though I question whether it was. To their credit the seller sent me a new product free of charge to make sure I was satisfied. The replacement is of a higher quality, but it is definitely not the same quality as the Brother DRM I am replacing. But it is less than 25% of the Brother DRM cost."
2,Misleading entry.,"This is what I saw. Note it says Other products by Brother. I thought that the term compatible meant that the drum would work with more that one Brother Printer. Amazon misled me.""Brother Compatible DR-510 20,000 PAGE DRUM UNIT USE WITH HL5140/HL5150D/HL5150DLT/HL5170DN Other products by Brother"""
1,Did not meet expectations,"The unit is defective. When you copy any document, it comes out too light. (I replaced the cartridge also). Never had this problem before."
1,Brother Drum,"I ordered this because the advertisement said that it was an original ""Brother"" drum. Upon receipt of the product it was not an original ""Brother"" drum but a reworked one. No where in the ad was this stated. I could have bought a reworked replacement for less elsewhere. Since I needed the drum right away it was not convenient for me to return it even though the amazon partner would allow me to do so. Be careful when you order these types of things to insure that you are getting actually what you expect and not an inferior replacement."
1,Maybe I should not have spent my money on this...,"I am one of those guys who dutifully changes the oil in his car when the mileage is up. So, of course, when my Brother printer hit the 20,000 mark and started telling me it was time to replace the drum, I spent the money and did it. Of course, the drum I had was printing just fine, but who was I to argue with scheduled maintenance?Now with my NEW drum, I get ghost printing when I print envelopes. I get a weak image of the first text and then a second even weaker image of the text again below it. It is like the toner is sticking to the drum and getting put on the paper a second time as the drum turns. If I move the blue slider back and forth a few times it will clear up for a little while.I need to call Brother and let them know my problem. I regret, though, spending the money on a new drum, when my old one was working perfectly fine. Unfortunately, I through the old one out before we discovered the problem with the new one."
2,This is NOT manufactured by Brother!,"Even though the title of this item is ""Brother DR510 20000 Page Drum Unit"", it is NOT by Brother. It is a ""compatible"" unit. There is nothing in the product description that indicates this is NOT an OEM (Brother) item, and I feel that this is very misleading. I have not yet decided whether to try it out anyway, or return it based on false advertising."
3,drum unit,"I guess this product isn't so great since my drum unit caused quite a bit of smeared ink marks on my print outs and copies. I had to replace it well before the 20,000 copies mark."
4,Romance of the Ranchos,"This is an interesting booklet describing the early California ranchos. I have all the radio programs done in the 40's. They were a derivative of this work. While by today's standards the information is rather bare, it was an interesting read."
5,"J.Giels ""Full House"" great live, hard driving!","I had this album when it came out new in 197?I liked it then, and I really like it now!Some of the lyrics & music came back to my musical memory from decades of storage. This is high flying, hard driving, live entertainment at its best. Geils, Magic, & Wolf - wow!"
5,the best,"The best live album by any band ever made. Simply incredible. Buy it, get enebriated, and play it loud."
5,Music,This is a great classic rock CD although I am into heavy metal I used to own this on vinyl. Will not go wrong.
5,A high energy classic,"Crank up the volume. take your shoes off and get ready to dance and party. The music on this cd will bring out the smiles, sweat and sore muscles the next day. This is fusion of blues/rock and roll and soul with an attitude but ultimately it ends up fast and fun."
2,Made mistake downloading the MP3 album.,"This is a great album. I made the mistake of downloading it in MP3 format. This mean they cut in between each song. To do this to a live album ruins the whole feel of the album. Other than that, it's great!"
5,Great for groups,"We bought a set of these for our very busy library children's room. They have held up very well and are very popular. Their softness is fun to hold, and quiet for banging, and nice for teething on, too! We like them so much, we're getting some more."
1,MADE IN CHINA,"I was seriously disappointed to learn that this product is Made in China of dubious materials. I attempted to call customer service, which operates at very limited times (9-5eastern, I live on the west coast), and got a scripted response about meeting safety standards instead of assurances re: the materials going into the manufacture of these blocks. Because I could not be reassured about PVC or BPAs, I returned these, unopened. I am annoyed the description (at the time I bought them) did not clearly note Made in China, or I wouldn't have bothered."
5,"Buy it for the video, keep it for the rest of the album","I've always liked ""Something Stupid"", but there was always that sort of creepy dynamic to it with the Sinatra's version. I mean, here was this father/daughter duo singing a song about a charmingly disfunctional romantic relationship.This version is as musically pleasing as the original, with the bonus of the video which is pure fun: 60's high fashion collides with 90's sexual mores. I saw this is a bar and had to run out and buy the import - it was well worth it."
3,A Promising Debut,"If you like Jeff Buckley/Radiohead there's a good chance you will like this. It's pretty mellow throughout, and the standout tracks are definitely ""On days like yours"", and ""Thank you for laughing"". Sometimes the similarities to Oxford's finest become a little too much, but overall, a promising beginning."
4,A very simple yet effective EP. Relaxing and 'cute',"Each track has its' own level of *niceness*, but as a whole, the CD (or tape...whatever) combines to be a great one to listen to on your own in crappy or sunny weather. It doesn't change very much though - so be careful if you're looking for a varied sound.HIGHS: (tracks-)Adam & Lorraine; Thankyou for Laughing. the production is as simple as the songs allow, but it has a great warm feel to it.LOWS: (track)You-shaped hole. The almost'over-simplicity' might put some people off."
1,Sooo so bad,"How anyone can give this even 3 stars, let alone five is beyond me.This is so bad it's painful to watch. The acting is awful. The story terrible. The music, frankly if I were black, I'd find it insulting. Plus Van Peebels' wardrobe looks more YMCA than cowboyThis is the biggest turkey I've seen in a while. It's a kids film... I think it would be ideal for 8 or 9 year olds - who might quite enjoy it. But honestly - it is sooooooo bad.I was expecting to sit down and watch a good western, with an intersting slant to it. Boy how wrong was I. You've been warned."
3,"Better than the ""editorial review"" thinks it is","Tom Keogh, whomever he may be, is quite mistaken about the quality of Mario Van Peebles film, which is somewhat more than simply a ""black western."" Despite the ""camp"" appearances of several black celebrities, Peebles brings to the film an arresting visual quality and an iconoclastic, unmistakably ""dark"" [no pun intended] perspective on How the West Was Lost, which is one of the biggest tragedies of American history. The historical background is suitably complex, tieing in references to the Spanish-American War. Although the lead character's gunslinging talents are made too much of, this is far from cliche."
5,Another look at American History,"Possie answer questions about America that is not found in the history books of my growing up (1960's-1970's) I did not know that ""cowboy"" was then a racial slur. To be a cowboy was just as bad as the ""N"" word.But time has changed that and now its good to be a ""CowBOY"""
2,Pretentious Nonsense,A pretentious western that complelely misses the mark. Probably every black cowboy or gunman in the old west would laugh his head off at it.
2,Faulty Refill for one of the two in the card,"I bought a Cross Ballpoint refill, fine black, 2 per card a few months ago. One of the refills worked for 2 days then went dry, the other was OK. I wrote explaining what happened and you sent me another set at no charge even though it was a little beyond the warrantee period for which I was grateful. The same thing happened to the new set you sent me, one was dry in two days and the other I'm still using. I think the Cross Company needs to improve their quality control. At least I have two refills that work out of four that you sent me, so I'm not asking for another set. I'll just think twice about buying Cross pens from amazon.Paul Martel"
2,Took too long,"The product arrived arrived as described, 14 WEEKS AFTER ORDERING!! On the bright side the refillls do fit in my pen."
3,living green,i like that you can replace but this one didn't fit exactly to my pen. cross could have made it easy and kept all their pens the same size so this wouldn't be an issue because it would be nice to be able to order a fill for the pens without having to worry about it not fitting???
1,Crap!,"I'm not saying that all things made in China are cheap and lack quality, it's just that this one does! A. T. Cross & Co., I probably won't buy any of your products for a while yet."
5,"CMJ review of ""Flight Safety""","While she was still a member of the dark, jangly trio Crowsdell, Shannon Wright wrote intense yet sparse songs that were too disjointed and emotionally naked for most pop fans. After two albums, an EP and a collection of 7"" singles, Wright broke away from the band. Around the same time, her label, Big Cat Records, more-or-less dropped out of the music industry. Disillusioned, Wright sequestered herself in a home studio in Alabama to concentrate on the material that would comprise Flightsafety. Self-produced and crafted using little more than an acoustic guitar and a piano, the record conveys powerful feelings of solitude and isolation with a completely numbing sense of introspection. Wright's voice is hushed and gentle, as she looks to heal old wounds and to express her music in its purest and most heartfelt form. - Glen Sansone: CMJ New Music Report Issue: 614 - Apr 19, 1999"
5,Captivating!,"I've seen Shannon Wright play live only once and would emphatically recommend that, if you can, you go see her play.Her CD captures the essence of the live show and is very, very good. OK, it's great! Go buy it!"
3,lyrically mixed,"shannonwright has a very warm voice, which I like as a contrast to hermostly somber lyrics. Flightsafety stands out to me for these lyrics, whichrun the gamut from extremely interesting, innovative metaphors (tracks 2, 4)to awful, what-was-she-thinking moments like ""I'm her colt and she's my mare""(track 3). But overall, I like this CD --especially the instrumental track 7."
4,Zoo Crazy,This is a great film for the family or any animal lover. That it's based on a true story makes it even better.
4,Zoo,"A very nice ""feel good"" movie. This is really a family movie so you can watch it with kids of all ages."
2,More Formula,"Producers have a checklist of what mass appeal hooks to use to sell a movie. All they have to do is check off as many as possible; change the locale; change the actors. Everything else is plug and chug.Checklist:Modeled after Zookeeper and Mr. Popper's Penguins.Have single parent (typically a male because they are usually the most incompetent) with angry, dispirited teen (usually a female, but switched for this go around) and a younger and cute with no issues sibling. Mother is dead but we will see her as a memory displayed as if in a commercial. Lots of cute animals acting more like household pets than wild animals - very educational. Animals don't really die they just change into an ad graphic. Staff that always include love interests for whomever needs one and a couple of bizarre behaving staff for comedic purposes.Predictable feel good fantasy ending.Positive:The acting by Maggie Jones carries the whole movie. One to watch. Everybody else just seemed like ""actors"", even the animals."
2,Shocked at the unnecessary foul language,The cursing was pervasive and so not needed. What a waste for an otherwise acceptable movie. I would not recommend this movie to families with children under 14 because of the language.The child actress was truly adorable. Let's hope she doesn't become another Miley.
3,Cute,This movie is worth watching for adults and children. It is cute and contains interesting information about animals and people.
1,Very sad,I was hoping this would have been funnier. The focus is more on the wife who pasted so very sad overall. Would have liked to see more animals.
4,Cute family movie,"I liked the movie. Moved at a good pace, was very interesting and enjoyable. This would make a great movie for family nite."
4,What a sweet movie!,"I saw this movie in On Demand and liked it better than I thought I was going to. I know that it is an ""Americanized"" version of the real story, but that doesn't matter. Matt Damon is such a good, all around versatile actor, and this part doesn't hurt his credit one bit. I will say that not using Thomas Haden Church more was a lost opportunity, and I don't think Scarlett Johanssen brought anything special, but she was just fine. Great family movie, and those are far few between these days."
4,we bought a zoo,"Such a great family movie...i bought this for my step daughter, i think i have watched it just as much as she has!"
5,Touching movie,"What a magnificent, heartfelt movie! It had me from laughter too tears, happy of course. Its been ages since I have cried that hard from a movie."
3,"Skip the movie, watch the extras","Hey, I usually love Cameron Crowe's work, too, but the movie is bland, Matt Damon doesn't quite have the acting chops to pull off the pathos, and there's nary a moment of unpredictability. The extras, on the other hand are worth the price of admission. The true story of Benjamin Mee has a terrific interview with the subject (though I'm still wondering where the money came from in this whole operation), and the nearly 90-minute documentary ""We Shot a Zoo"" has fantastic interviews with the animal trainers, awesome close ups of all the animals, more of the backstory, and satisfies completely as it's own self-contained documentary. The story always should have just been a documentary - it had enough going for it without being turned into schmaltz. But Crowe's musical tastes and a mostly terrific cast kept it watchable. Now ... back to something you know more about than transformed grief, Crowe ... the tranformative power of rock music!"
4,Family Oriented Film,Matt Damon does a great job portraying a survivor father with two children. This is a good family film that I am sure everyone can sit around and enjoy. There really are no surprises and you can guess where the movie is headed although the conclusiion is left to you to finish. We enjoyed it and would recommend it for your family to view.
4,Zoo Review,"A Real good family movie. I would recommend it for any one that has kids. At the end, you feel good and enjoyed watching it."
4,Good family film,Fun movie about a nice family. More romantic than I expected. More focus on the family than the animals but that's OK
5,Great Movie,"More than just a family movie... this is a really heart warming and enjoyable movie. Great story, great characters, and great acting. I loved it!"
5,More Than Just Animals,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Expected a cutesy animal flick but was delightfully surprised by a movie that is much more about the humans than the animals. Believe one of the casting criteria for this film had to be a great smile because there are more winning smiles per hour than any other movie I can remember. I assume this is marketed as a family movie but with some very mature plot themes, I consider it more of a date movie."
5,Absolutely excellent!,"Extremely well-done at all levels. I highly recommend this movie to EVERYONE. Sweet, smart, funny, and full of love. I watched this with a small mixed age group. Even my 15-year-old grandson liked it. We all did. A very pleasant surprise!"
5,Unbelievable,Matt Damon oh my gosh what a hunk.I saw this movie in the theater and just had to have it. Not only for the fact that Matt was in the movie but just the scenery and the animals. Well done on this well. Could not wait for it to come out on DVD. I love this movie.
4,cute,I don't know what to say.....it was cute. When my grandkids were small and with me it would have been a great movie to show them and talked about it.
5,A heart warming family film despite the rating.,"Excellent film. Excellent casting, acting, & script. It's about love, grief, family, and the important issues in life, the more meangful ones. Matt Damon shines in this."
4,Cute family fair,"This is a nice family movie. i believe the Matt Damon part was a bit beneath his skills as an actor, but that did not decrease the enjoyment of the movie. Good solid story."
4,Cute,"This is a nice family, sit down and feel good movie. Gather the family around, make some popcorn and watch the good guys win for once. ;-)"
2,We Bought a Zoo,"It was an ok movie, no chemistry between Johannson and Damon. Couldn't quite figure out the role of the brother. The little girl who played Damon's daughter stole the show. Glad I didn't pay to see it in the theaters"
3,We bought a zoo,"My wife and I viewed this movie as a possible gift for our grandkids. We liked the movie, but wondered why they allowed the little girl to call the inspector ""...a Dick, but I don't know what that means"". Without that comment I would have rated it 5 Stars."
4,Got it,It did not come as quick as usually. But I got what I paid for and am satisfied. The movie is very good and I and my wife like it.
5,Great movie!,"This is a great movie to watch with the family. Everyone enjoyed it from my teenagers to my toddler, even my husband too! It is such a heart touching story and I even enjoyed it more when I found out it was based on a true story!!! Great movie!! Don't forget somecpopcorn."
4,"good, but predictable","Overall a good movie, even though it is a bit predictable. I truly enjoyed watching the characters, even though I could guess the ending ten minutes into the movie."
4,Good Family Fun,"I watched this with my kids and we all liked it. I was a little skeptical when I saw the hokey title, but it wasn't corny at all (a little unbelievable in parts, but good nonetheless). The only thing I was a little disappointed with was when the little girl says a swear word toward the end of the movie to the obligatory bad guy. Other than that, my kids and me would definitely recommend this movie."
4,nice family film,This is a pretty good film for the family. For everyone in the family. My husband and son watched with me and they enjoyed as well
5,good video for all family members,Very good story.. shows how people can adapt to new things & take on challenges..not every day someone gets a chance to run a zoo.. to find out what each animals diet was..thier physical health etc. not to mention the 2 children who also have to adapt to thier new life style
4,Good family movie,Takes awhile to get started. They turn a run down zoo into a nice place to visit and get to see each other in different lights.
3,Good family movie,"Nothing wrong here, 3 stars because it is good entertainment, but nothing exceptional. Good family movie, but very predictable. as expected."
3,Great value,"Arrived on time, fair price for this movie which is sure to be a hit with families of young kids"
1,Bad language,Too much bad language for my kids. Parents beware. I was hopeing that this would be a good family movie. One that all the family could watch. But to my suprise there was too much bad language for my children. Any bad language is too much for me but I know that i'm living in a dream world to expect that. Why do movie makers always have to put bad language in movies ESP so called childrens movies?
3,Kids rate this mediocre at best,"I left this up to my kids to review and it clearly was not a hit. The movie is long and did not keep them glue to the screen like other zoo related movies. I have enjoyed most Matt Damon movies but I felt he was just barely ""acting"" for this movie. In the end we didn't feel this movie had any real heart."
3,I Got Charged Twice,"Apparently the Tivo box upstairs didnt have enough room on the harddrive, so when I ordered the movie I did get charged but it didnt download even after I emptied the harddrive. I ordered it again downstairs because I kept receiving a message stating that there was not enough room and was charged twice in the end. The movie was awesome though"
2,Boring! What a shame!,"We had high expectations considering the good reviews, but unfortunately very boring, limited plot, poor acting. Had to turn it off. Silly, just didn't make sense."
3,Good but why the spot of bad language?,"This movie was a good movie, but was fairly predictable. I would have given it four stars but for the spot of bad language which was thrown in there. Most of the time the language was suitable for children, but there was this one segment where inappropriate language was used. I'm not talking disgusting amounts of swearing, but it was out of character for the most part, and really not necessary.The acting was average, though Colin Ford did well, Matt Damon was excellent, and Maggie Elizabeth Jones was superb! ScarJo was not consistent nor terribly appealing -- but then, I am not a man. Overall, it was okay, and I think it will be great once edited for TV viewing."
3,Great Movie,"Be careful of what you think you really want. This movie kept my interest, however unrealistic the story line was."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun",It makes you want to buy a zoo or a dude ranch or something out of the ordinary. The story is heartwarming and uplifting. Like a kid's dream come true!
3,light comedy/romantic tale,"Disappointing movie, more about the dad's adjustment to his wife's death, and starting over with his children, in a unique setting, an old zoo...."
2,"Liked it, but can't watch it with my family.","I gave it only two stars because I can't watch it with my children. The movie was cute. It was kinda drug out though. Run time was kinda long. The reason I can not watch it with my children is because their is some words that are threw out not only by the adults, but by the fourteen year old son. As a mother who trying to raise her children to conduct themselves better then this young man did in this movie I feel it was inapporiate lanugae, and therefore we will not be watching this movie again. I was very upset knowing that the parents of this two kids who played in this movie allowed that language to be used around their children, and that the parents allowed their fourteen year old son to use language that he did in this movie. I guess just care what it takes to make a buck now days."
4,"Better than I thought it would be.,","The previews for this movie looked awful, but it was actually pretty decent. The film did a very good executing a not so stellar storyline, in my opinion. A good watch."
5,"Movie "" I Bought a Zoo"" on my Kindle",Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I watched it on my Kindle on a flight to Florida. I only wish they would make more movies like this without foul languageand sexual scenes.
4,Great family movie,We thought this was a very good movie to sit down and watch with our kids. What makes it even better is that it is actually based on a true story.
5,We Bought A Zoo,"I enjoyed this movie, it was funny and entertaining. I love Matt Damon and it was nice to see him in something other than an action movie."
4,Family like it,"Entertaining, a bit dark at times so make sure of the viewers and their maturity before viewing.Kids liked the movie but wondered why it drug on during some the parts (popcorn/potty breaks).The music matched in well with the story and provided a good back drop.this is one of those you'll like it or hate as reviewers have proven. our family liked it and it provided us a chance to talk about a few issues after the movie. how do you talk with someone when they suffer losses and seem to do something that makes no sense to you. but does to them."
3,Very sweet,"Although this movie lost a lot of its magic due a large number of curse words (don't watch with children), the movie itself was quite good. It's a cute sentimental tale of a family trying to reconcile the loss of their wife/mother. It was an interesting movie, good acting, and good outcome."
4,Good movie,Good family movie. Love that it was based on a true story. I even looked up information on the actual family. Great to hear that the family is still running the zoo. Too bad it's in England.
3,Cute story and fun for kids,I brought my 6 year old niece to this film and it was a bit adultish for her to get into for the first 20 or so minutes but its a great story and great acting.
4,heart warming,"This was a very heartwarming movie. If you are feeling down and need a pick me up, this is the movie."
5,We Bought A Zoo,"This was an amazing movie! Now we want to go to this zoo for real. My husband and I decided to wait to rent it instead of going to the theater, but realized t would have been worth the theater prices."
4,Good family film!,"Cute story, humor for all ages, great message! My husband and I previewed this and found ourselves quite entertained and went away saying we would probably buy this for our daughter."
2,No money left for good screenwriter or filmcrew,"This movie had all the charm of an after-school-special made for not-prime-time TV. Actually, a mediocre one at that! Believably on a scale of 1-10 (10 is best) is 2. The start was decent...the ending was dreadful...and there were far too few compelling moments in between. 5-star reviewers lie...you better lower your expectations a few stars in order to avoid disappointment."
1,Typical hollywood tripe,"Could have been good, but they had to pollute it with hollywood propaganda. There's the required anti-gun message. So Mr. Zoo Owner can't shoot an escaped grizzly bear with a tranquilizer gun, instead facing him down mano-a-mano? But wait! Somebody else saves his life using...oh, no!...a rifle shooting a tranquilizer dart! Beyond unrealistic to dangerous, if people think this is what they can do in real life. Then after jumping through the hoops and getting their permit, a tree falls down and blocks the road, so visitors can't get in. Staff helps everybody climb over the tree. I'm sure OSHA would love that one! They did get one thing right: The USDA inspector was a petty tyrant bureaucrat who loved using his power to get over on people."
1,Bad quality,The movie was an okay one...but the quality was horrible. You could barely even see the actors faces for most of the movie. I felt like I was watching a film that someone else filmed with their own video camera.
1,Horrible Video Quality,Very disappointed that we paid for this movie in HD. The video quality is horrible. Only about two minutes into movie but super annoyed with the quality of the picture.
1,"this is not a movie, just a preview",thought i was going to see the movie.. not just the preview of the movie.. what a waste of time
1,NOT a family movie!,there was just too much cursing and disrespectfulness. This iMovie should not have been labeled as a kids and family movie. Not to mention very boring. turned off the movie before it could even get past the boring stage.
4,Charming movie,"I ordered this movie when it became available on Amazon's lightening deals, and paid five dollars for it. I'll pay five bucks for a movie that looks like it has potential. This movie did not disappoint me. I found the story rather charming, though I have to say I wish they would have kept the story closer to the actual true story (google if you're interested; it's a great story to read), but alas Hollywood can never get things quite right.In the end, I am happy with my purchase. I would caution, however, not to overspend on this movie. In my opinion, 5-7 dollars is a good price range."
4,Short but sweet,"I like the movie, but it was short. The message was encouraging. I usually go for clean comedies, but happen to stumble upon this gem. It is heart warming and worth watching for any point in your life."
1,Ruined Easter for my kids... Thanks alot!,"Not the best movie and with the profanity and the line that shares that ""We live with a 7 year old that still believes in the Easter Bunny"", how can this possible be considered a good movie for kids let alone a family movie? I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who's kids are actually old enough to understand what is being said. That would be my 5 year old who has now had Easter ruined."
1,"great story, terrible language","This was a really great story-humorous and touching. Unfortunately, the movie has many curse words. So many in fact that after my husband and I saw the movie, a week later we were still remembering curse words in the movie. The story seems great for a family film, but the language makes it more of a film for teenagers."
1,NOT FOR CHIDREN!!!! Should be PG 13,"It seems as though the makers of this movie went out of their way to make this an unfriendly film for families with small children!!!! A lot of bad language, went out of their way to spoil the Easter holiday tradition knowing that young children would be watching!!!! :( Could have been a good movie had they considered the feelings of children. The overall feel of the acting,directing, and script was in my oppinion mediocre. Advertised as a ""family film"" during the hoiday season, a zebra with cute bow wrapped around his neck. Sorry, but I would think the average family would want to come out of a movie feeling good during the holidays, not depressed! So glad I didn't watch it in the theaters I would have walked out and requested a refund."
4,Family,This movie is kind of a family adjustment movie. It is not extremely exciting but such movies might not be. Maybe it dont hurt to tone down movie experiences occasionally. Glad to see this actor in a different type of movie. Something suitable for kids.
3,sorta a Disney piece.,Sorta a Disney piece. Not sure why Matt would do this kind of thing. I might've known from the title.
4,Great for the family,Heartwarming and funny. Matt Damon plays a great father figure. Great for the entire family young and old...and the animals are the best actors of all.
4,Cute and hokey,"Movie was cute, did not have a fairytale ending but was more realistic that way. Reasonable acting more of what you would expect."
5,We Bought a Zoo,"Really expected this movie to be a little ""cheesy"", but our family enjoyed it very much! I have loaned it to my sister so they may enjoy. I'm sure it will be viewed again and again....well worth the money- a beautiful addition to my DVD collection!"
4,Great Movie,"I have always bought every Matt Damon movie ever made for my collection. When I saw this one, 'We bought a Zoo', I thought it would be too 'kidsie' for me to enjoy, but I loved it!! It was great!!! Try it; you won't be disappointed!!"
5,FANTASTIC!,"This movie was beyond fantastic! Matt damon & the rest of the cast glided this movie PERFECTLY. With PERFECT acting this is the PERFECT family movie. Good morals, Good plot, Good meaning overall."
2,not enough to keep me interested,"This movie is cute at times but overall is weak.Generally, decent acting but plot is lacking authenticity and interest"
5,A great movie. even if it was a familey movie,I watched this moview from beginning to end wishing I had make some popcorn before hand. Did not want to stop the movie to make some. It was a great movie I give it 5 stars even if it was a family movie
2,Not for little ones,"I was really excited to sit down and watch this with my kids (15 to 4 years old) since there aren't very many PG kid movies out there to enjoy. Something inside me decided to check on pluggedin.com and see exactly what is in the movie. There are 4 S*** words, one d**n, one h**l, one A** and 1 D**k.I was really disappointed in that. I don't need my little ones hearing that language and possibly repeating it. In my opinion, this movie is stretching the PG rating for sure.In my opinion the movie is good for older kids and adults, but a warning for those with little ones, who think because it's PG there won't be any language in it .... there is."
5,"Buy ""We Bought a Zoo""",We Bought A Zoo arrived in very good condition in quite a timely manner and I was completely satisfied. I gave it as a gift to my aunt and she loved it.
5,Great Movie!,"We really enjoyed this movie as a family. My granddaughters really loved it too. My only complaint is the few swear words that are used (for our granddaughters' sakes), but overall it's a great family movie! Loved it."
5,A delight!,Good family fun along with several visual and plot related surprises. I can watch it over and over and still see something I've missed. The cast has a great chemistry and connection to each other and to the story line. Enjoy!
5,Nice family movie,"We got this on a Lightening Deal at Christmas time. Great movie for the whole family, even a toddler that loves animals."
4,Fun family film,"Purchased for our daughter, middle aged, who loves movies. Matt Damon gives his usual warm performance and this will be absorbing for anyone from 10 years old----------------"
5,we bought a zoo,"excellent movie sad, but funny covers the family lets you feel from all angles of each of the charecters. It is fun not all serious. Being a true story it is fantastic I want go see the zoo some day after I retire."
3,good service from amazon...movie just ok,"really did like the movie in general but, frankly, am sad to continually see American children disgruntled, at odds with parents, disrespectful, etc..... the list goes on. Our family structure is breaking down, and it's a very sad thing for this world that God initially created so beautifully. So.....that's my take on things! Did like many, many parts of the movie, so would recommend it in that sense! Thanks!"
5,A great find,"You know the feeling when you find a great LP you've never heard before and you play it over and over again? Well this is what happened to me when I bought Crosswinds, got it on vinyl which makes it even better and like most people the stand out track for me is ""Heather"" (8 and mins of magic)"
1,crosswinds,"THIS IS WHAT I ORDERED, INSTEAD I GOT ""SHABAZZ"" (IN THE CROSSWINDS CD CASE. HOW DO I COMPLAIN TO AMAZON? NO PHONE # TO CALL, NO ONE TO COMPLAIN TO. ANYONE WHO CAN HELP, EMAIL ME AT DTB420@HOTMAIL.COM"
5,I think this is a masterpiece!,"Not only because I saw it performed live at The (sorely missed) Bottom Line in NY, but because Cobham is at his swinging, funky, explosive height. The tunes are great, the solos are great, and ""Heather"" is about the most mellow Jazz/Rock/Funk tune ever.Pick this one up. It still causes me to break a sweat just listening."
5,"El Camino, a road for all.","I am an American student of Spanish and have been for many years. If I could shake people, Americans and others, to wake up to truly great literature I would start with Miguel Delibes because he deals with life at its irreducible beginings, a small town, a little boy and his relationships. There are no props, no embellishments only life in its atomic state.We don't have the verbosity of Marquez as magnificent as it is. Instead we have a Spanish Checkov who tells a story simply yet oh so powerfully.The atomic structure yields particles when we use our imaginative accelerator to split the center. The tracings yield all kinds of meaning and significance. It is a true test of the reader to come to grips with her-himself and see if you can carry the ball that Delibes has passed to you.I recommend that you read ""La Mortaja with this book. It is a short novel and even more condensed yet just as satiffying as ""El Camino."""
3,"Un libro espectacular, un formato revisable","El contenido del libro es insuperable, no había leido nada de Miguel Delibes y es auténticamente delicioso, el formato del kindle deja mucho que desear: Palabras pegadas, letras que no aparecen , etc...Deberían realizar una revisión del libro para subsanar esos fallos y permitir al lector que pueda disfrutar de esta joya de la literatura en toda su plenitud."
4,Beautiful and Intense!,"This book of poetry blew me away. Being from Newfoundland, I am constantly looking for new and exciting poetry. Scarecrow is a beautiful book of poetry, which deserves some attention!"
5,"Quality.Service, Safety","I purchased the DVD 'four Jills in A Jeep"" with some trepidation as I hate giving bankcard details on the internet but all is well so far.The DVD is as promised 'new' and sealed/ I had to alter my 'zone""(?) to play it on my PC but had no difficulty with my DVD player. The quality - despite the years - is very good. Even the sound has 'travelled' better than I had expected. The service from the supplier was excellent and well within the time specified despite the Christmas break. Thank you. Now if only you could find more of the Dick Haymes movies !!! William Bourke"
1,DISSAPOINTED,alice fay was not really in this movie. just a song. i was dissapointed as it was noted as an alice fay movie.
4,A Great Tribute to Women in WWII,"What sets this movie apart from other ""B movies"" of the era is that it's based on a true, courageous story of a group of Hollywood female entertainers who risked their lives to bring a moment of happiness to the troops during WWII. Far from the publicity and limelight loving selfish entertainers of today who use the media for their own purposes, these women risked life and limb to simply entertain and take the men away from the horrors of war for a few minutes. They asked nothing in return other than the thanks of the soldiers, and they endured many of the same hardships. A great story line with more substance than others, and worth reflecting against our values of today. If more of us were devoted to service of our fellow man, perhaps our society would be in a better place today. These ladies deserve much attention and thanks for their efforts."
4,Much better than I thought,"When this movie came out I was turned off by the stupid title and unattractive cast. But when I saw it recently for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised.It is very funny. The opening voice-over about the presidential motorcade had me laughing uproariously. As a wacky comedy of course it is not weighty, but its political content makes it more serious than I thought. I think those people who say Michael Moore hates America have a point. :-0"
4,"It's not about Canada, stupid!","In 2004 it seems impossible to see this film without Iraq in mind.Haven't we been looking for ""the enemy"" since the end of the cold war?There has to be an evil empire....How could we sustain all the""military industrial"" complex ( Eisenhower) without an enemyand without regime change?Michael Moore has really proved how right he is ---even withoutthe Cannes Film Festival!"
3,Michael Moore goes Hollywood? What would Roger Smith think?,"Actually, as big a jerk as Smith is,who cares? Moore peaked with 'Rogerand Me' , though the Cheap Trick-influenced, The Big One and Fahren-heit 911 are pretty good too. Aldais perfect in here as the Clinton-ESQUE clueless (Sorry Alicia!) USPres. who's wily Press Sec. Smiley(Kevin Pollack, Grumpier Old Men,others) starts a mock war with 'OCanada' to improve Alda's ratings!Candy, Dan Ackroyd and others aregreat in here in Canadian andAnti-Canadian roles! Candy's bestperformance and unfortunatelyhis last. R.I.P!"
4,Great Movie!,"This movie is hilarious. How could you not love a movie about a cold war with Canada! That's right, Canada! The terrifying and scary Canadians are completely unaware that America is declaring war on them, to increase the presidents popularity with the publi. This movie is a must see for John Candy Fans, although he isn't on screen as much as I wanted him to be. Oh well. 4 stars for this movie. ""Imagine you're kids pleaging allegiance to the maple leaf."""
3,Beautifully skewered.,"I borrowed my office mate's copy of ""Canadian Bacon,"" prepared not to like it. I've previously succumbed to the rather arrogant opinions of critics who've knocked it before they've tried it (echoing the opinions of MMoore from below). But the late John Candy is an idol of mine, and I've learned over the years that he's- particularly at his most insane- an acquired taste. That's okay. Public gun-and-ammo auctions, pickets *against* the President, Niagra Falls suicide wagers, Canadian graffiti required in both languages- it's not for everyone. I have yet to return this DVD, but I really should just grab my own, so I can once again hear Kevin Pollak tell the overly zealous defense commander, "" General, try and pretend you're not here!!"""
5,amazingly smart comedy,"Michael Moore, a satirical genius and one of the best representatives of truth and reason in the U.S. presents a funny and appropriate movie for America's current political state. From amazing writing to an all-star cast, those who loved Roger and Me or The Big One will really enjoy this smart comedy."
2,Even Robin Hood misses his target once in a while,"I'm sad to say that I thought Michael Moore's first stab at fictionalized satire is a far cry from the brilliance of everything else he has produced to date. Perhaps someone who doesn't already share Moore's passion for social and economic justice might find the humor in ""Canadian Bacon"" less obvious than I, but I saw most of the jokes coming from miles away (or kilometers, in the case of the Canadian segments). If you're looking for political satire that is both dangerous AND funny as hell, check out anything else Moore has done, as well as ""Bullworth,"" ""Bob Roberts,"" and the Citizen Kane of all political satires, ""Network."""
5,Candy's best role is his last role,John Candy is as funny as ever in one of the funniest movies of the decad
4,"Pretty hilarious, eh?","If you've ever wondered what distinguishes Canadians from Americans, just watch this film and you will find out. I'm not sure who he is lambasting more, us or them, but the results are hilarious. Having lived in the ""Great White North"" for ten years growing up, I found Moore's satire particularly poignant. Especially lines like ""We're your worst nightmare: citizens with the right to bear arms!"" All-in-all, a pretty good laugh."
3,Sounds better than it films,"The Bottom Line:If someone described to you the scenarios and jokes of Canadian Bacon you would probably think the film is a work of comic genius, for a lot of the gags are quite clever; unfortunately, however, Michael Moore's lone foray into non-documentary filmmaking reveals a lack of understanding about what makes for good comedy and satire, so the film regrettably remains clever on the page but fairly lackluster on screen.2.5/4"
3,"Great one-liners, but no movie.","In the movie, the Cold War is over and the country needs a new enemy. Thus the White House wants to create a state of tension between the US and Canada. They don't want an actual war, but only an enemy that they can use for political and econmic benefit. The premise was used in ""Wag the Dog"" and so it isn't new, but you don't need a new premise to make a movie. What you do need is a plot. I have never seen a movie with so many memorable one-liners that wasn't a great movie. The equivalent would be if ""Some Like It Hot"" had its jokes, but Curtis and Lemmon had no reason to pretend to be women. The one-liners make the movie worthwhile, but the plot which has John Candy and friends invading Canada on their own after the White House creates a Canadian menace is weak."
3,I have another opinion about this movie,"John Candy is horrible he was just reading his lines. Temple of doom's Dan Aykroyd was offbeat. It was a mess. War against Canada Director:Michael Moore Cast:Brad Sullivan,Jim Belushi,Kevin Pollak,Alan Alda, John Candy,Rip Torn,Chevy Chase,Dan Aykroyd,Bill Nunn, Steven Wright,Kevin J.O'Conner,Rick Moranis,Mike Meyers, Ivan Reitman,Richard Lewis,Colan Mochary,Drew Carey,Rhea Perlman,G.D. Spradlin,Michael J.Fox,Lorni Gudd,RichLittle Laura Burn,Joni Mitchell,Raymond Burr,William Shatner,Rick James,John Pruitt,Tim Thomerson,George Plimtom,Howard Morris Jason Robards,Kent Smith,Shecky Greene,Terrence Young."
5,Great movie that is indeed a prophecy,"I found this movie to be rather hilarious in a political sense when I first saw it, but now the current situation with Bush and the US just adds onto it's charm.Dubya, like Alda in the movie, tries to draw attention away from domestic problems by creating a war (Iraq) just as Alda does with Canada. You'd think that Michael Moore is a prophet by seeing this movie today.Anyway, great movie for those that like satrical comedies and have an interest in politics. John Candy does a great job and the movie is one of the most under-rated of all time."
1,Canadian Bacon,It doesn't work. I just get an error message. How can I get one that works? I assumed there would be no problem so I threw away the packaging.
5,Bob,"Substitute the word ""Iraq"" everytime a character says ""Canada"" in this film and you'll see Michael Moore as eight years ahead of his time. The dim-witted President whose advisors talk him into stirring up a hate campaign and a war against Canada to make Americans forget about his domestic failures, the jingoistic NBS news network (think Fox and CNN), the female soldier held hostage by the Canadians, allegedly being tortured (think Pvt. Jessica Lynch), the phony claims of Canada planning an attack against the US and obtaining nuclear weapons and the anti-Canadian stupidity that strikes Americans (think banning French Fries) such as boycotting Canadian products - all came true. Maybe not the funniest movie ever made, but timely today since it seems like a documentary of the Bush administration."
2,Good movie - Poor Video Quality,Ran's a great movie that deserves a better transfer. I saw the film in the theater a week before getting this blu-ray. It was a scratchy print but it didn't have the noise that is prevalent in this disc.
4,One of my favorite movies of all time!,"This is the one of the best films ever created. The landscape, battle scenes, plot, everything is near perfect. The DVD, however, is poorly mastered. Image quality is fuzzy and the subtitles are barely legible. It hardly does any justice for this cinematic masterpiece."
3,Good Movie...Poor DVD,"I concur with others here. An excellent movie but the quality of the transfer to DVD is poor. For a movie that is visually stunning in its original presentation, this DVD was a real disappointment for me. Fortunately, there's a Criterion Collection version out that I intend to get. They do excellent restorations and transfers of films. I just regret the money I wasted on this copy. So, save yourself the grief and buy the Criterion Collection version.Hope this helps and good luck with your purchse!"
2,"Beautiful Print, Dumbed-Down Subtitles","The print is beautiful, but the subtitles have been altered. For Saburo to say, ""It makes me nervous,"" instead of ""It isn't right,"" is preposterous, given his character. Why would Criterion even mess with the English translation? Why do all that work just to ruin something?"
3,"Fantastic film, but strange picture","I just got this yesterday and immediately stuck it in the player. I have to agree with the last reviewer; I was disappointed in the the picture on this disc. I was looking forward to it after the distastrous previous edition, but this picture seems both fuzzy and unnaturally colored. The green of the grass seemed unearthly. Many of the colors seem extremely bright. I skipped around in the first commentary track and that sounded very enjoyable, and of course this is one of the most wonderful films ever made, so if you have not seen it, you better. I am surprised to hear praise of this new DVD presentation. It makes me wonder if some discs are better than others?"
3,Try Criterion Collection,"Yes, the movie is a masterpiece, though it is only loosely based on King Lear. There is no Edmund, no Edgar, no Gloucester, and the ""king"" Hidetora's tragedy stems in part from his past murders and cruelties, and not, like Lear's, from mere pride, stubborness and anger. The older Fox-Lorber DVD has somewhat washed-out color and framing problems. But at least on my equipment this Masterworks DVD has color that is too bright, with bleeding, sparkling, strobing, and a generally very ""hot"" image, not at all film-like. The disc does look great on my laptop computer's LCD screen, but a small screen is not how one wants to watch an epic. Buy this DVD if you don't already have the Fox-Lorber version, but don't spend the money just to replace the Fox-Lorber; this isn't enough of an improvement. Addendum Jan. 2006: There is now a third version of Ran, this one put out by the Criterion Collection. The image quality on the Criterion is better by far than on Masterworks or Fox-Lorber."
1,If this is a sign of what's to come from Studio Canal Blu-Ray we are in real toruble,"Despite what some say, I honestly think the old Criterion release looks better with an up-converted DVD player. Studio Canal is trying to recast themselves as a new criterion-like lable, they are not off to a hot start. You are better off trying to find the old Criterion release (plus the Criterion has the audio commentary track which is missing from this disc) Shame on you Studio Canal for trying to compete with the best. Leave the Great films to the folks @ Criterion. Sad day for film lovers"
3,"Technically Brilliant, BUT",tedious and rather academic. The battle scenes are the stand out in this beautiful but flawed film. It's said that Kurosawa worked on this film for 10 years. Maybe he tried too hard! Perhaps that is why it is over blown and tired at the same time. Lacking the rich characterizations and humanism of Kurosawa's earlier works it entertains but in the end leaves you cold. It could have used a big dose of Toshiro Mifune!
5,Masterpiece,"The movie is by far one of the best movies I have seen, its a masterpiece with one minor flaw (its a tad too long for my taste) but I digress- If you love epics and political intrigue and Shakespeare but with a Japanese Samurai twist this is for you. For anyone that likes Game of Thrones this is up your alley for sure."
5,"Great documentary disk, great movie","The Criterion collection is terrific for Kurasawa fans. The interviews with him are illuminating and the watercolor narrative derived from his paintings is very interesting. If you don't yet have a copy of Ran, this collection is the one to get."
4,The best.....but,"I just received my copy of the Studio Canal Ran from Amazon. The first thing I did was AB this version with the Criterion SD DVD. The Sudio Canal blu ray version is absolutely better, hands down. Could it be better? Absolutely! There are definitely problems, ie the whites burst in the outdoor scenes and the grain is inconsistent. But the images are sharper with much more detail. Colors brighter. Just a guess, but the film source probably has limitations, so no matter whom was going to release the blu ray it is probably never going to be reference quality. It is the best version of this film released on any home entertainment format. Until there is something better I will be happy owning the Studio Canal version of this great film."
5,Breath-taking!,"I grudgingly rented this movie on the recommendation of my brother (who's taste in movies runs toward Conan the Barbarian and First Blood.) For once, my brother turned me on to something worth watching. I was captivated. I became an Akira Kurosawa fan instantly. Loved Kaede-finally a female role with teeth."
3,Fuedal Japan meets Top Director,"I highly recommend watching this incredible motion picture,however be prepared for poor translation to DVD. There is no digital compensation an soundtrack emulation is miminal. No effort was taken to enchance or even capture faithfully the original masterpiece. Kurosawa would never have agreed to this graphic travesty. That being said,the production is bested by none, though ""Kagemusha"" comes very close. If you can tolerate the graphics,it is still a must,unless there is hope of a superior video translation."
3,Ran,"This film is about an aging lord named Hidetora, who decides to give his three sons parts of his kingdom. The oldest two sons, Jiro and Taro are happy with the decision. Saburo on the other hand isn't not and he suggests that his father is crazy and ends up banished by his father. Saburo ultimately ends up being right in the end and this leads the viewer to actually believe that Hidetora is actually crazy. Although everyone in the movie good, bad or ugly eventually sucumbs to death the director got the message across. The movie was good but long like 4 hours long, could have been much much shorter, I give it a C."
4,"Great Movie, DVD a bit lacking","This movie is a spectacular epic, adapting King Lear to the world of Japanese fuedal kingdoms. The battle scenes are breathtaking to behold and the adaptation is briliantly carried off by everyone involved. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars, in my mind, is the DVD. I would have appriciated some special features or commentary, but there is nothing added to the disc. That said, the movie is alone worth the price."
2,"Movie wonderful, DVD treatment horrible","There is now doubt about the quality of this film. Ths issue is the substandard encoding or transfer used for this new DVD. Through out the first 40 min. of the film, there are intances of both horizontal and vertical blanking - a static which appears on all vertical and horizontal lines. It is also obvious that this film was mastered from a film print and not the interpositive -- the blacks are fuzzy and the dark scenes look as if they have a scrim or screen over them. I also noted two instances of sound drop outs.All of these are issues which could have been fixed. It's very sad that greater care wasn't taken with this film, and at the price point which Winstar is charging, they should have at least tried to get it right.Hey Winstar -- third times the charm....."
5,Kurosawa at his very best!,"Amazingly powerful and poetic. A masterpiece from the master who is obviously still in his stride. King Lear has never had a backdrop like this before. It is such a romantic and beautiful piece, every cent went to good use. There is no use in looking for a bad spot in the film because it doesn't exist."
2,Be Very Careful,"My star rating has nothing to do with the mertis of the film. It has only to do with the total hatchet job Fox Lorber did in their infamous DVD transfer. By no means buy this version of the film, even though you think you're saving a couple bucks. I agree entirely with the reviewer who said the only thing to do with the DVD and it's case is to use it for a coaster.The images are muddy and dark. The sound is old 78s quality. It really is a shameful, shoddy piece of work. By all means, order the movie. It's Kurosawa's magnum opus, great in every detail. Just make sure you shell out a few bucks more for the Masterworks edition, or splurge and go for the Kurosawa multi DVD collection.This review is meant solely for the Fox Lorber 1985 DVD release.BEK"
3,Highs and Lows,"Although this film was filled with accurate renditions of Ancient Feudalistic Japan, it was at times sporatic and VERY lengthy! The fight scenes where well done, especially the seiges. However, if the viewer has not an inkling of the guidelines Samurai lived and ultimately died by, they'd be utterly lost.This film was lacking something the entire way...I found myself wishing the Great Lord would just find a sharp rock or anything to commit sepikku!"
2,I WISH PETER JACKSON WOULD REMAKE THIS!!,"This is a good action epic for the time it was made (the 1980s) but I wish that Peter Jackson (Fellowship Of The Ring) would remake it in English - he's our finest epic filmmaker right now and he could make this story both more exciting and more emotional (this version lacks feeling). Also, modern day special effects would allow for bigger battles and more realistic violence. Yet this version is still worth a look if you are into epic action movies like ""Braveheart"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"".Peace."
1,Not as good as all you people are making it out to be,"This movie is terrible. I bought it expecting a good action epic with lots of battles and sword fights. There are no battles there are 2 massacres where all that happens is ""samurai"" with guns? shoot each other and women. samurai dont have guns. The story was good but they ruined it with 2 hours and 30 mins of talking on and on about the same topic over and over, yak yak yak. There is no drama the characters dont develope except for the old guy who just walks around starring and goes crazy. The perfomances are the same in everyone, yelling even when there happy, and they all sound the same even the women. No action, no drama, nothing except talk and fake blood from the stupid shooting, not swords, guns, What? Very bad movie, I was dissapointed, greatly. I would give 0 stars but they dont let me."
3,beautiful to watch and admire,"The storyline, heavily Shakespearean, is about a wealthy Warlord who has 3 sons, one of which is bestowed the kingdom. Unprepared for battle he is conquered by deceit. Although medium scale war moves quite patiently, the director keeps your attention to the main characters with effective display of strong acting performances, mesmerizing costumes and large sceneries in Shogun perspective. Literary allusions run wide throughout the film too. I don't want to spoil them for you; but you will be surprised how obvious they really are."
1,A Great Disservice To A Wonderful Film,"After the cancellation of Criterion's Blu-ray last year, I was hopeful that Studio Canal would have the sense to use their new transfer. Alas, this is the work of amateurs! Looks more like a 2008 Blu release (the term ""upconverted"" has been thrown around a lot, and after seeing screen captures I can see why). Shame on you, Studio Canal, for pushing such a sub-standard transfer on us Kurosawa buffs!"
2,"A Decent book, but not one of Ms. Mayhew better books","""Those in Peril"" by Margaret Mayhew tells the story of Louis Duval who after the fall of France to the Nazis decides to leave France for England. After arriving in England Louis comes to stay in the lodgings of Barbara Hillyard a young widow. Louis then enbarkes back to France as an agent for Allan Powell of the Royal Navy.This is not one Ms. Mayhew's better books. The characters seem flat and not that interesting. The loving triangle was not even interesting. If you are looking for a good book by Margaret Mayhew check out ""BlueBirds."" It was a much better book."
2,Poor product quality control,"I am a carpenter by trade, and unlike the previous 2 star reviews, I am well aware that this tool isn't meant to cut clean through drywall, rather it is meant to score the paper face of the drywall to make the final cut nice and clean.My complaint about this product is what I can only assume comes from a lack of product quality control. The adjustment knob that locks the pin is incredibly stiff (to the point that I had to use a set of vice grips to loosen it). Additionally, the adjustment knob is shaped similar to a flying saucer and the edge of the 'saucer' is very sharp. On other circle cutters I have used, the outside edge of the knob is similar to the edge of a quarter, and the ribbed edge seems to make it significantly easier to make quick adjustments."
4,"Works great, very useful","Worked great for cutting circular holes in drywall, My only improvement would be to make the blade cut a little deeper. I got around this by cutting both sides of the drywall with the circle cutter.. i pushed a nail through the center hole and used it from underneath. The end product was great however."
2,Hard to use and barely cuts...,I liked the idea of using this to cut holes in my ceiling to install in-ceiling speakers. But this tool is very hard to us and it barely cuts through the sheet rock. You really have to push up on it hard and it still hardly cuts through. I do not recommend this. I had much better luck using a roto-zip tool and bit.
1,Honor Among Thieves,"I, personally like this movie, the story is sample but interesting.Specially, the scene that the chief inspector bet with one of the thief for the true story.Unforturnally, the quality of the movie is horible. it's smear, out of focus, and the voice is broken from time to time.I wonder my dvd is original one or a copy? my family really disappoint a lot. my last thing to said is: the story is good, interesting but the quality of movie is awful"
3,Overseas Bronson,"First off, although it is in the english language, this is a foreign film, so go into it expecting no less. For those who have seen Bronsons other foreign films you know they have a different, more 'artsy' feel to them. Nonetheless, it is a fine production with a great performance by Bronson in his prime. Great story and acting but maybe hard to catch it all in one viewing. The tape I watched was recorded in the substandard LP mode so picture and sound were disappointing to say the least. I've read the DVD was no better. Not a Bronson classic but an enjoyable caper and a character in the Bronson tough guy persona that we are accustomed to. Worth the small price people are asking but I'd like to see a better transfer someday. For great Bronson films, I recommend St. Ives, The Mechanic and Hard Times. For a lesser known classic, don't miss Machine Gun Kelly, the movie that started it all..."
4,HONOR AMONG THIEVES,"I REMEMBER SEEING THIS FILM WHEN I WAS IN MY TEENS, AND, LIVING IN GERMANY. I'VE ALWAYS FOUND CHARLES BRONSON TO BE A GREAT ""TOUGH GUY"" ACTOR, AND AT THAT TIME, I REMEMBERED IT AS BEING VERY SUSPENSEFUL. I HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO FIND IT ON TAPE OR DVD, SO, WHEN IT BECAME AVAILABLE, I GOT IT RIGHT AWAY. I WILL ADMIT THAT IT LOSES A LITTLE DUE TO THE ERA IT WAS MADE, BUT, I STILL THINK IT'S A GOOD PERIOD PIECE THAT STANDS UP PRETTY WELL. IF YOU'RE A BRONSON FAN, YOU WILL PROBABLY ENJOY THIS FILM, IN SPITE OF THE OLD 70S STYLES!"
5,Don't bother with anything else,"If you are tempted to buy a plastic pan to save a few bucks, don't do it. This one will save you time and frustration. It will outlast several of the cheapies and you will be happier using it. It's much easier to clean . It cleans your knife much better. It's a whole lot tougher. The advantages are many, the disadvantages are few. Buy it."
1,Go to dollar store,"This leaks everywhere. I bought this after watching a review from a popular cooking show on PBS. They said this brand did not leak, but it does. Save your money!!!"
2,Leaks,I can't recommend this for people who will actually be traveling with it. It doesn't seal and leaks if not kept upright. Great if all you need it for is to keep your coffee warm on your desk.
1,Beware - Great Mug ... POOR Lid,"I have owned 2 of these mugs, and the sliding closure have failed on both within just over a year of daily use. This is very disappointing since the mugs were not inexpensive to start with, and they are not very useful as a thermal mugs without the ablity to close the lid. So buy replacement lids, right. Although Timolino makes replacemnent lids, they are difficult, if not impossible, to find on the internet - the replacements for sale on Amazon.com are unclear as to whether they would fit this mug. Even if they do, shipping is over $10."
5,"great desk mug, not so much for my travels","I bought this mug to keep my protein drink cold in the car until after my gym workout. It keeps the drink fairly cool if I fill it completely with ice, but liquid seeps around the sliding sipper and drips. Does not keep the drink cool in a hot car in summer - maybe it would with the regular sealed lid. After dripping on my clothes in the car for a week, I decided it works better for me as a water mug at my desk. Keeps H20 plenty cool indoors, lid keep dust and gnats out. I stick a straw through the sipper (I drink about 2x the amount of H20 with a straw). It is pretty and pink and still professional looking. It does leave water with a definite metallic taste like all of the stainless steel bottles I have tried. P.S. The BEST bottle to keep my protein drink cool for two hours in my hot car is the Blender Bottle from GNC. I mix the powder with H20 and the blender ball works great, fill the entire bottle with ice and it stays cool until I am done!"
4,Cute bracelet,"I ordered a few of these bracelets in different styles as gifts. Though I am not sure they are sterling, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price. It also comes in a nice box that is perfect for gift giving."
3,Was so Pretty but started to rust,I ordered this for my daughter to give to her grandmother. It came wrapped so nice her grandma loved it. When she opened it she immediately put it on. After about 2 months though it started to rust. Even though it was so pretty I don't think i would buy it again because of that reason. It was worth it for the price to wear for a couple of months. I just wish it didn't rust because she loved the bracelet.
1,Lousy product - broke first time we used it,"We were very disappointed in this product. We purchased a set of four to anchor a portable soccer goal. The first time we screwed it into the ground, it broke. The metal didn't snap, but it bent. The corkscrew shaped portion kinda unwound. So now it's useless. Won't go back in the ground when we move the goals. (I don't know if it hit a rock or something, but our soil isn't **that** hard. And after all, we are using it for it's intended purpose - it's supposed to go into the ground.I've seen similar (or identical) products offered by other vendors. I suspect they're all made from the same manufacturer. I think this is just a fundamental design flaw. We're going to try another type anchor. I think these corkscrew type anchors just won't cut it."
3,"Excellent Book, Poorly Transcribed","I love Mr. Lambdin's Lewrie series of yarns, and was eager to read this departure. The novel itself did not disappoint, and I highly recommend the book. The Kindle edition, however, had so many transcription errors, that they detracted from the story... 5 stars for the story, 1 for the transcription."
5,BIRD'S THE WORD ELMO,ADORABLE AND SO CUTE FOR LITTLE ONES. HOURS OF FUN WITH THIS TOY. HOLD'S UP WELL AND NO SMALL PARTS TO WORRY ABOUT. LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BUT NOT OVER POWERING WITH THE VOLUME.
2,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this for my son last Christmas. He was 20 months old then. What a disappointment! Don't get me wrong, we LOVE Elmo! I also have a very high tolerance for ""noisy"" toys. It just repeats the same thing over & over. Very annoying! He also flaps his 'wings' and wobbles forward. That works OK if he is on a flat surface, but if he is on carpet or runs into ANYTHING he falls over and squirms. My son played with it for about 3 minutes & would never play with it again. I felt guilty selling it in my garage sale for $[...]."
1,Not as advertised,"The description states two times that the unit is solar-powered or charged. I ordered this unit specifically because it was solar. It is definitely not solar - as verified by the seller after the sale and by my own research on the William Joseph website. I have wasted time in getting this item, printing the return label, posting it back to them, and ordering another item. The seller says that, on Amazon who ever lists an item first gets the listing and everyone else who sells the same item has to use the listing that they have provided and we are unable to change the listing. Doesn't matter; the seller knowingly sold an item that couldn't perform as advertised. I am so tired of blaming someone else. It remains to be seen whither I get a return shipping reimbursement or not. By the way, I received 3 units instead of the 2 I ordered. Maybe it was accidental, maybe it was meant to pacify me."
3,Meany Season,"This is a decent crime thriller, but it was hurt with so-so camera work, elevator music, and mediocre romance. Mariel Hemingway is a fair enough actress but she doesn't light up the screen with Russell in this movie. Good acting by Kurt Russell, Richard Jordan, and Andy Garcia carry the movie. With a little better quality camera work, some appropriate music, and someone like Kathleen Turner (Body Heat), in place of Hemingway, this would have sizzled instead of slow cooked. Kurt plays a burned out newspaper reporter in Miami. He is thinking of moving to Denver with his wife. When a killer calls him he becomes the center of attention for the whole country, but when the killer becomes jealous all he cares about is in danger. Jordan does an excellent job of being creepy with every minute of his screen time. A year later ""Manhunter"" was what this movie could have been. I recommend this for a rental before buying."
3,Decent little flick .......,Saw it years ago. Recently ordered it. Enjoyed watching it a second time. Kurt Russell's always fun to watch.
3,"A suspenseful movie,patheric DVD,no extras just the trailer!","In this movie Kurt Russell plays a Maimi news reporter who becomes a public mouth piece for a serial killer. The movie very suspenseful at times. This movie also stars Andy Garcia(When A Man Loves a Woman,Desperate Measures) and Mariel Hemingway(Bad Moon). Of course there is a cat and mouse game between the killer,reporter and the police. This movie is prefect for a hot summer night as it takes place during the summer! The Mean Seaon is rated R for swearing and violence.The DVD is Ok, The only thing you get with the DVD is the trailer. I wish MGM would add more features on this such as a behind the scenes,cast bios, other MGM movies the stars have been in like ""Winter People"" with Kurt Russell, delated scenes etc. Only buy this movie if you like this kind of thriller and can live with the features!"
1,Did not get it,I was unable to down load the movie so I was unable to view it! Not happy! Tried to do this in the airport before a flight!
4,should have been reviewed more closely,"I blame myself for this purchase not going back, I kept it and it was skipping but now it is stuck in my dvd player. Again this is my fault and not that of anyone else."
4,Country Blues fans apply here...,"Steve James may play country blues, but it's great blues nonetheless. In addition to being a great songwriter, James has the blues vocal qualities that are so often (and so poorly) imitated by others. From the rollicking Galway Station Blues to Stack Lee's Blues, James masterfully entertains. You're never left wondering why James is doing what he's doing, the recording is that comfortable. Blues fans should really give this one a try."
1,talk about garbage,"its sad when great bands sell out and let other people write their songs for them. thats all rap is, those idiots dont write their songs. its too complex for them. HWM used to have deep lyrics about their lives and experiences, now its muddled garbage. screw you epitaph!"
3,Peek into the lives of Hong Kong prostitutes weighed down by well-meaningness,"On the downside, this exploration of prostitutes working in the waning days of the Hong Kong nightclub industry suffers from way too much earnestness. It's all good intentions gone amok. That said, the script reflects some real insider knowledge of the lives and attitudes of these girls.... and boys, as Whispers and Moans deserves special kudos for putting a ladyboy and his bisexual gigolo boyfriend into the mix. In other words, not all sex workers are pretty girls, although this film has its share of the latter, especially Mandy Chiang as Nana, a sad and diffident girl who goes to work in the fashions of her Japanese namesake. Whispers and Moans almost captures the special glow of classic Hong Kong cinema of the 1980s and 90s. I only wish it were a little less frank and a little more naughty."
3,"Elvis-riverboat gambler/singer ""Doin' Her Wrong Gets Caught""","Frankie and Johnny (1966) 88 Min.Rated: NR Color Starring:Elvis Presley,Donna Douglas,Harry Morgan, Sue Ann Langdon, Nancy Kovack, Audrey Christie, Robert Strauss, Anthony Eisley. Director: Frederick De Cordova. Elvis is a riverboat gambler and Donna Douglas (Elly Mae-Beverly Hillbillies)is his lady love. As the headlined act (Franky & Johnny) on the paddle-wheeled steamer they should be happy cruising the Mississippi but Lady Luck (gambling)keeps luring Johnny (Elvis) to the roulette tables where he loses all his money. A fortune teller tells him that a red-headed woman will change his luck and he meets a beautiful redhead and goes on a hot winning streak. But it's not as hot as Frankie's (Donna Douglas) rage when she hears he's been ""doing her wrong."" Lots of songs including the title and When The Saints Go Marching In. The period sets, costumes, and Harry Morgan's performances are great also!"
3,Not his finest hour: he's doing you wrong,"This movie is kind of an Elvis version of Showboat which is a classicalmusical.The result of them making Elvis Presley in to a contract worker whostars every year or so with a new different starlet was that he got reallypretty bored. It shows a lot in his performances here:the zest is gone and what is left is just work infront of a camera. He must of felt like a piece of meatsold to the highest bidder.This picture is about all that is wrong about the contract star system in Hollywood. Sure they get famous and rich, but the soul sold is forever gone."
2,Muddy mississippi mayhem,"A slapdash effort at recreating a folk legend, the story of Frankie and Johnny suffers in the heavy hands of the Presley machine. The only redeeming features are a couple of atmospheric numbers (""What Every Woman Lives For"" and ""Hard Luck""), and Harry Morgan's deft comedy timing. Even the old chestnuts ""When the Saints.."" and ""Down by the Riverside"" get a workout to try and fire up the action, with little success."
3,entertaining,"THE FILM IS QUITE ENTERTAINING AS A MUSICAL PIECE. LACKING ANY IN DEPTH PLOT(WHICH IS COMMON IN ALL ELVIS MOVIE)THE FILM DELIVERS PLEASANT ENTERTAINMENT AND BRILLIANT MUSICALS BY THE KING. I WOULD RECOMMED THIS FILM ONLY TO ELVIS FANS, WHO CAN TRULY APPRECIATE HIS TALENT."
2,Make sure you know what you're buying.....,"The ad for this product is unclear. The picture shows COARSE sugar, not sanding sugar. This is noted a couple of times in the description, but unless you read the whole thing it is not clear what they are sending. It's also unclear what quantity they are shipping. What you get for $8 plus shipping is basically one pound of sugar...about two cups worth. I suspect there is some place where one could get a better deal."
5,ECCO Track IV,"I was born and grew-up in Europe thus ECCO Track IV is natural to me.Shoes are the most important part of man's clothing, you may have so so pants, shirt, etc., but if you have solid shoes you will be liked by ladies for sure."
5,Excellent book,"This book is by a big margin the best certification study book I have come across. It is to the point, clearly written and more importantly, set out sequentialy to reflect the official Novell Education training materials. I passed my exam with this book plus some eight months experience of NetWare5.My hat off to David James Clarke for this book, I have no hesitation giving it five stars."
5,Easy to Read & Good Pointer to Test Objectives,"The book is very easy to read and the author has even put in material to make it fun to read. If you want your professional reading to be as dry as a bone, that feature may jolt you. The book is a good general reference for NW 5 and not just for test-takers. However, the prospective test-taker should look at Appendix B. It provides the Novell test objectives and give the reference to the pages in the book where each objective is covered. If you've gone over the official text so many times that you're about blind, this explains the same things (plus more) in a very clear manner."
5,A true insight underlying our viewing pleasures.,"Being a true couch potato and an avid Star Trek fan, I can admittedly state that Dr. Bernardi has hit the nail on the head. ""Us, couch potatoes"" must realize how society around us shapes what we see on TV (and in the movies) thereby shaping who we are. Using Star Trek, a series that spans decades - including the movies and series spin-offs, is ingenious. This book clearly outlines how TV, movies, et al emulates our social beliefs and how intricately these beliefs are interwoven into the fabricate that is our being. Orwell's Big Brother is no match to our own psyche. Star Trek and History: Race-Ing Toward a White Future is insightful, as it is entertaining."
1,Misguided From Beginning To End,"I don't think I've ever read a book as blind to its subject matter as ""Race-ing Toward A White Future"". Bernardi misinterprets many of the episodes, taking certain scenes and characters way out of context, and ignores the vast majority of scripts that would counteract his hyper-PC argument. I found myself disagreeing with him in almost every paragraph. For example, Bernardi seems to think that every use of the color black in Star Trek and other Sci-Fi shows and movies is an automatically racist gesture (!); this is a paranoid, ignorant and ridiculous assumption. And just when it seems like he's about to make a valid point about a particular episode or scene, he takes it too far by making grandiose statements which have no basis in reality. AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS. It is poorly written, narrowminded in focus and misinterpretative of Star Trek's position on race."
1,Another Tiresome Politically Correct Diatribe,"Apparently Martin Luther King disagreed...Yawn...Another tiresome politically correct diatribe written by someone who has clearly exhausted the possibilities inherent in writing essays on the homoerotic aspects of Gilligan's Island and the feminist subtext of Bewitched. Like most diatribes of it's kind, it hinges its indictment of Star Trek's racism on the most petty and ridiculous things and has no connection to reality but to the author's black and white version of reality. Star Trek fans should avoid this nonesense like the plague, while fans of academic essays on the Brady Bunch as a metaphor for Apartheid and the end of American nationalism will lap it up like spoiled chili."
1,in search of a subject,"Bernardi likes to verb his wordage. This acts to weird his language. From whence does all this useless anger come? Reading this and ""Race in Space"" -an IDENTICAL book- depressed me almost as much as forum columns in the Daily Northwestern do. The examples of symbolism forming the basis for these two books' thesises are, while of obvious interpretation to the authors, mere fluff to each reader possessing operational neural function."
3,I ain't scared.,"As the title indicates, this book is a collection of ghost stories and stories about other supernatural phenomenon such as shades and poltergeists. There are 13 chapters (imagine that). By chapter 6 the storyteller's ""formula"" begins to emerge and the stories become rather predictable. The storyteller (Kuclo) is a (self-proclaimed) witch (see page xi of the preface)of the Scottish coven of Green Witches. She is affectionately known as ""Gundella"". In addition to her stories, Gundella provides guidelines for the use of the Ouija board and instructions on how to hold a seance. This book was not as much fun as I thought it would be. I cannot recommend it to anyone."
4,It was a very interesting book,It was a good book and I believe in this type of thing so I couldn't put it down. I plan to try to visit some of these places.
4,very good,local flavor of Michigan haunts that are good for a camp fire or lights dim low and nobody home
4,Great UP vacation read,"I read this book several years ago while vacationing on a rainy, lazy summer day in a cottage on Lake Superior in the Porcupine Mountains. I've loved reading books like these since I was a child, along with bear encounter stories, on that one odd day of the week where the weather doesn't cooperate with my vacation plans. I'm not a believer in ghosts or ghost stories yet I find it interesting that many people convince themselves of these myths and how they evolve. I was a ""true believer"" as a young child, yet realized as I grew up that most believers as just really good at (and even enjoy) scaring themselves so I have fun with it. The legends are a fun thing to read about, especially if you're from Michigan yourself and are familiar with some of the places and events described. If you're so inclined, buy and enjoy."
2,Not worth buying. Buy her other CD called DEB instead,"Very interesting phenomenon in Arab music. But... this CD is almost worthless. It you are interested in Massi, BUY the Albom DEB instead. Her work is interesting melange between Arabic and Euopean influences.Most Definetely buy the albom DEB, you WILL enjoy it immensely. Guaranted!If you are interested in modern classical arabic music, considerLebanese singer Fairuz, another terrific experience.For old classical tradition consider Egyptian Oum KhalsumAgain, you have to experience her music, but not through this CD"
5,Works great!,"I bought this after reading the reviews here, but was a bit skeptical if it would work on my little stereo. I works great!! Hooked up my 5G iPod video to the stereo, and the sound is just as good as playing a CD. I am impressed. It has a fairly long cable, and good connections. You still maintain control of the iPod with the wheel, unlike some car stereo units. The price has come down considerably, so even better. I would recommend this.I am not sure how it would work connecting to the TV, but I don't need it for that. I believe other reviewers have commented on that. Good price + good sound = good deal"
1,"All show, no go","PROS:- Looks nice- Feels very solid- RCA plugs provide a very tight fit- Thick sheildingCONS:- Lost the left channel after brief use- The barrels are too smooth - hard to remove RCA plugs from receiverThese cables look good and they feel very solid on the outside, but the innards don't bear that out. Mine failed after a few days when the 3.5"" stereo plug dropped the left channel channel. The RCA plugs are very tight fitting which is good, but the ultra-smooth chrome finish on the barrels makes it impossible to pull them out of the jacks without wiggling them (bad for the jacks) or using a pair of pliers. The barrels should be textured to provide better grip. Who cares if they're not shiny?I replaced them with a Hosa unit at a fraction of the cost and all is well."
4,AUDIO ONLY,I dont know why i thought this cable had VIDEO also. So i decided to purchased it to use it with my ipod and watch music videos on my tv but it only has red and white connection for audio ONLY not the yellow for video. Without the video is useless.
2,worthless crap,"i received the cord and it worked great as a stereo hookup for my Ipod, however the cord has developed a short in it less than a month after i received it! i did NOT misuse or abuse the product in any way, and as i bought this cord as a replacement for another cord that had the same problem (audio coming out of one side) i'm more than a little pissed. my past experience with belkin products tells me that they're overpriced but functional, this experience tells me they're overpriced, poorly made, and fragile no matter how simple their intended function. belkins price points are a clear case of lipstick on a pig.... avoid"
5,WORKS LIKE A CHARM !!,It was a good experience... i had no trouble with the seller and i received the product on time. It works great. Sound quality is awesome!
4,A noble attempt at defining a new paradigm,"Schafer's CULTURE: BEACON OF THE FUTURE is a noble attempt at defining a new paradigm for thinking about human potentialities and prospects. Schafer suggests we need to go beyond traditional and restricted definitions of human nature drawn from economics, political science, religion, psychology, and so on, and try to see humans, instead, in the broader context of culture as a whole. A more systematic, refined, and advanced view of culture, drawing on insights from many scientific and artistic disciplines, may, Schafer argues, help point the way toward a future in which human potentialities are more fully realized. The breadth of the knowledge the author draws on is impressive: my major reservation is the lack of concrete detail about how such a systematic study of culture might be shaped. Perhaps that will be the subject of another book."
3,Butter shaper,The mould is smaller than I expected which makes it more difficult to shape the butter. The design does make the butter look nice.
5,Roach unlimited!,"Well, there isn't much to say about the MASTER! There is no excuse to not own this beautiful recording. This comment is even more relevant if you have anything to do with drums (playing the drums or even just appreciating the art of drumming)..."
4,Quiet Fire - Roberta Flack,"This disc finds Roberta Flack at her peak -- flush with her initial success, and building on that with an album that combines soul and jazz feeling. It captures the times, employing themes of mass movement as well as individual passion. Highly recommended."
1,This is my second least favorite cookbook.,"I had high hopes for this book, as the writing and pictures are lovely. But the recipes are limited with minimal spices, usually cumin and paprika. I tried 4 of the vegetable dishes and only liked one. It seems a waste of good food to try any more with that batting average."
1,Not very good!,"This is really a third or fourth tier cookbook. I was sorely disappointed. The recipes are of average quality, but the writing is unimaginative and does not capture Morocco or even what it's like in an Arab country. For me the lesson is that pretty pictures don't make a cookbook."
2,Just okay,"Pretty pictures but disappointing recipes. I purchased this on the recommendation of the salesman when I bought my tagine. I did learn about certain features of Moroccan cuisine (preserved lemons, harissa, etc.) but the recipes aren't that tasty."
2,not many recipes,"hi, i am a moroccan from casablanca but i live in the united states, when i first saw this book and read the reviews, i thought i found the perfect cook book, but when i got it, i was not too happy with it, first off, there are only a few recipes, some of them are traditional , well this book is perfect for someone who had never tried the real moroccan food and is a beginner, but for someone who knows moroccan food and what it is suppose to taste like should try to find another, i personaly was iffy about getting a moroccan cookbook from a non moroccan author, but some of the FEW recipes are good but i would rather get one that is writting by a moroccan author. i give the book a 2-3 star but it is not EXCELLENT, and i want EXCELLENT."
4,BlackJack Chaper is one of best ever written.,The book in general is very good in giving a overall view of Casino games. But what makes it a Classic is the Chapter on BlackJack. I've read many books and articales on BlackJack and the chapter in this book is as good as it gets. The Basic Stragety for two decks is reinforced by the Giants of BlackJack. ( Thorp Braun Humble ) I first read the book 20 plus years ago. And have not seen anything that summarizes what you need to know about playing BlackJack any better.
2,Very little to gain,"This book covers most types of casino gambling, the problem is that there is very little helpful information.Save your money, you probably already know what is in thisbook."
2,Just so so,"I work retail sometimes and want to get tips to be better at my job. This CD is mostly for salesman that sells to large accounts. Although I think the attitude he is talking about is good, I just don't get that many actual tips or techniques I find helpful. Plus, I would challenge that if the product that you are selling is great, it is not as impressive you can sell it. It would be that you can sell something that is just average. In this CD, there is no mention of any particular technique to be a great salesman to sell just anything even if the product is not that great."
5,The Secrets of closing are all here!,"If you are working in Retail or Direct Selling the techniques for framing and closing a sale are all here.This little book is literally worth thousands of dollars in sales commissions if only you would stop and apply some of the well proven ideas in this book.The ideas are simple, well proven and easy to apply.I have trained literally thousands of sales people in the Retail Electrical Appliance Industry in Australia to sell extended warranties. I encourage them to use some of the techniques in Brian Tracy's book and have literally watched individuals sales figures skyrocket over night as a result.If I was a business owner or sales manager working in sales I would give a copy of this book to every team member and then use it as a focus for team meetings and skills development.Highly recommended"
4,common sense selling for everyone - not just salesmen,"The psychology of selling isn't just for salesmen. Anyone who uses persuasion in any situation will benefit from the skills, theoretical principles and techniques provided here. Brian Tracy's refreshingly non-patronising approach is both thorough and easy to understand. The author's experience shines through to deliver sound understanding and boosts the listener's confidence at every turn.Like all of Brian Tracy's work this excellent programme is littered with great ideas and insights into areas such as motivating customers, overcoming objections and closing an agreement. A wonderful guide to the mysteries of truly effective communication and persuasion which not only equips the reader with the skills of selling and persuasion/negotiation but also makes it simple to spot techniques when others try to use them against us.An excellent resource for beginners and 'old hands' alike."
5,Brian Tracy is the best,"Selling is so much more than fast talking and the gift of gab. To truly selling, you need to understand the mental game: of yourself, the buyer, and the prospect. Brian delves into all aspects to produce a program that is rock solid. The Psychology of Selling covers all the basis from prospecting to closing to overcoming objections. Adhering to the sales philosophy of kiss (keep it simple silly), this is a quick listen for anyone looking to boost their sales.Todd Natenberg, Author of the book, ""I just got a job in sales. Now what?"" A Playbook for Skyrocketing Your Commissions"
2,Old School,"My tape cassette reads, ""Updated for the 90's."" Well, on this tape you will learn tired, worn closing lines that were old far before the 90's. My advice, get your hands on a book called THE ACCIDENTAL SALESMAN by Chris Lyttle. He also has a audio sales training products on this website."
4,"If you are a pro, there is still some value, if you are new it is good stuff",I would not say The Art of Closing Sales has any ground breaking secrets that you cannot find in other sales books or courses. I will say the presentation style worked well for me. The information is not flying by to fast nor does it drag on and on. I would say for a professional seller who has been doing this for years will find a few points that maybe of value. Someone who is getting into selling should find this helpful.
5,A must have for all salespeople,These tapes are something that every sales person should listen to and memmorize. The ideas are truly enlightening.
5,Provides practical tools to help you achieve your goals.,Brian Tracy presents tried and tested techniques in a credible manner. You will learn what top salespeople do to close sales. You can then choose which strategies best suit you.
4,Well done. Tracy is a Master.,"I have applied Tracys input at various times in my career. It is not the knowing but the application that helps us become better sales professionals. Some of his teachings are basic, common sense. Yet the way that he illustrates the usage and prinicples are second to none. Also encourage ""Zig Ziglar on Selling."""
3,Disc One was great; Disc Two..not so good,"I enjoyed the first of the two CD's, but thought the second disc was directed towards ""Cheesy Used Car Salesmen"". This was a disappointment."
5,Great product !,This is may favorite perfume and it can be a bit hard to track down at retail stores. The convenience of having it arrive on my doorstep in lieu of having to search it out made it all worth it. Smells wonderful and I get so many compliments on it.
2,"Really Disapointing, almost ruined our trip","I haven't had such a bad time with any guidebook before. The authors seem to really dislike most of the places in this area, so almost put me off visiting a really nice town, and their restaurant research seems confined to the few standard tourist offerings and then a listing of fancy expensive restaurants. It's not difficult to find a good meal in France for 35 EU, any hotel can recommend one, we wanted the book to help find which was the best of the cheaper places. I saw a ton of restaurants in Marseille with menus 20 EU and under, but no clue which of them were good. Really disappointing, useful for the usual city maps and all, but the opinions for things to visit, eat, etc. not helpful at all."
3,There is a better live compilation,"The ""Michael Schenker Story Live"" and ""Unforgiven Live"" are both better packages. If you want a straight ahead best of package then get ""Essential MSG"". Not that you can go wrong with Schenker :)"
4,It just took a little long,It just took long but arrived in good shape. Maybe if it was cheaper and faster. It was for my nephew
3,"An interesting read, but.......","As I'm interested in Japanese literature I bought the kindle edition of this title. It was an interesting read, but left me feeling dissatisfied. The character of Mrs Oishi was well drawn, but the children's were less so. I felt that the big time gaps detracted from the flow of the story. The typos throughout the story were annoying and I didn't think it was worth the price.A better read by far is Totto-chan told from a young child's viewpoint as she attends a primary school run by a headmaster whose educational standpoint was well before his time."
2,is this right ?,"is this par for audio quality in the day ? maybe my memory is shot but I don't remember it being this poor. wife still loves it anyway, she's why I got it."
3,Sound quality issue..,"I ordered this CD based on the many good reviews, as I love BJ Thomas's music and have many of these same songs on Vinyl or cassette, which are now getting old and I wanted to update my collection. I'm disappointed in the varying sound quality on this CD and I should have paid more attention to the 2 reviewers that mentioned this problem. The first song Billy and Sue does not sound anything like it does on my tape, it's much slower, BJ's voice is also deeper compared to my cassette version of this same song. A few other songs sound almost like they are dying, meaning the song gets so slow it almost sounds like you turned the power off while it was playing. Many of the songs are very good, but unfortunately not all sound quality appears to be correct or enjoyable. Lastly, the CD case was broken at the hinge upon delivery from Amazon."
1,Very Disappointing Quality,"All of the hits are included, but the quality leaves a great deal to be desired. A better sound quality is expected in this day and age of technology. It is definitely overpriced for what you get and a terrible disappointment. Consider other options to obtaining the same songs."
3,Moving on to Modern Techniques,"Competitive Pistol Shooting was written with much competence. However, it may no longer be the practical shooter's bible for quotes and tips. It is definitely educational and it always helps to expand on one's knowledge, especially for the gun enthusiast. It discusses certain positions and even logistics of the sport, but one may question the effectivity of the author's ""style"". Much better positions and techniques have been offered by Mr. Ayoob, those that do not break under stress, those that are more practical for sport and self defense. I would still recommend this book to beginners who are in the search for comfortable shooting techniques because there is no single technique that may be called ""Universal""."
4,retraction,"who is the hack writing this review. having seen csny, ny, c&n and manassas back in the day, i must insist on an apology from amazon. stills is pushing 70 and cant sing any longer,but that's today and so what. we have everything he left (and they)us."
4,least accomplished? Absurd!,"It's really the critic ""thing to do"" to throw mud at Steve Stills, the guy Richie Furay considered to be the mainspring in Buffalo Springfield and the guy who did most of the playing on the fine first CS&N record. Granted, he had the ego of the century and it's on display here, as he muddles into attempts at gospel and acoustic blues, but most of this record is pretty fine. I especially like the superstar cameo tracks here, because the stars play some lovely music. No surprise; Steve was a terrific musician and he could draw strong performances from other players. From 1967-9 Stills was one of the big innovators, too. Least accomplished, my foot!"
4,Gavin McNutt??,Where did Amazon get this guy McNett to review the music of Stephen Stills? He obviously does not have a clue of this music or the history of Rock & Roll. Steve Still was song for song on par with Neil Young during their Buffalo Springfield days and in CS&N he was head and guitar more accomplished in every way than David or Graham. CS&N was a group that was certainly greater that any individual but it is the work of Stills that has stood out as the best they had to offer.
5,Black Queen is worth the price of this CD,"If you haven't heard the selection, Black Queen, buy the CD and listen. This is one of the best recorded Stills selections and is a blues jem."
5,"Least accomplished ?, WRONG","I have to agree with all the above comments being outraged by the comments Stills was the least accomplished of CS & N. If it were just between him and Young, i'd say it was strictly a matter of taste however, least accomplished compared to Nash and Crosby ?. Just for technical ability alone this would be dead wrong but if you consider Still's tunes even before CS and N with the Springfield compared to Crosby and Nash's output pre, during and post CSN, Cmon (Sweet Judy Blue Eyes compared to Almost Cut my Hair-I think not). This is a great album with great tunes, singing and playing. Hey i'll tell you how to judge whose the most accomplished. Put Crosby and Nash on stage and let them perform anything solo, then put on Black Queen from this album, that should stop this debate about, ""least accomplished"" right in its tracks."
5,Stills in his prime,"Aside from being one of the 10 standards for '70's music, his collaborations with Hendrix and Clapton are now treasures in themselves. I last saw CS&N at Irvine Meadows in 1987 and they played for about 4 hours as the crowd overflowed the parking lot, the access road, and parked on the shoulder of I-5 for 3 miles in each direction. Out of respect for their audience - some whom arrived over an hour late - they played the last 2 hours free. In addition to tremendous talent, Stills and CSN have class. Please change your review, you embarrass yourselves."
5,Stills 1st Album is still the best,"I first heard this album when I was a child. An Uncle of mine had made a reel to reel album of Albums for my Parents that included both Santana Albums, Sly & Family Stone Greatest Hits Record, and Neil Young's Everbody Knows this is Nowhere, but it was Stephen Stills Album that made a huge impression on my young mind. From his Guitar playing to his beautiful Lyrics I had never heard anything sound so mesmorizing. Favorite Songs include Do For Others, Black Queen, and Love the one your with. My favorite Track is To a Flame. Little known Fact: The drummer on To a Flame is Ringo Starr. I highly recommend the other Albums I mentioned."
5,Great CD,"An often overlooked solo artist, Stephen Stills has been an instrumental part of Rock and Roll and this CD showcases his talents as a singer, songwriter and guitarist. Great guest artists like Hendrix and Clapton round out the sound. If you love music, this CD should be part of your collection."
5,Maestro Stills,"The Amazon Reviewer guy must not know...such a pitifal description of this album. Stills includes some of his most astonishing and acomplished guitar and recording saavy on this vinyl. It's a favorite and has been since its release (at my house). Stills' artistry knows what sounds to keep and which to toss and a master who knows how to tease just the right licks out of his instruments and then ices the whole deal in the technical realm as well. Stills is THE de facto cross-over country, island influenced and GREAT rock n roll bluesman of this age. And a real smart man as well, just listen to his lyrics! Congratulations on your brilliance Steven Stills!! This is one of his best recordings ever....."
3,Klein 5102-24 24-Inch Canvas Tool Bag,"If you know the 5120-series of Klein bags, then I don't have to tell you about the quality. I bought this one to replace my last one; however, it's just TOO big. It's too big to lug around a commercial/industrial job site. What I don't need for the first or last half of the day stays in the gang-box. Regardless of quality, the handles are the same as the smaller bags- two rivets each. That isn't enough for the weight that can this bag would hold. My smaller ones are barely supported by the same handles."
3,You've Got to Give it to Me,"This album is a decent album with a few filler songs but the classics are (Ain't Nothin' But a) House Party, then you have skip track #2 to track #6 to get to the good stuff, Southside Shuffle is one of my favorite songs by the bluesy bad boys. Hold Your Loving is one of the boy's underrated gems and now for the best, the closing track called Give it to Me, an FM radio staple which has a great sing along chorus as well as a distorted guitar solo and it could've been easily done by Beck Bogert Appice (whose album also came out around the same time).If you're a diehard classic rock fan, then you should get this album."
5,Great Album Of White R&B,"BLOODSHOT is a great white R&B album, with deep roots in the Memphis-Chicago-Muscle Shoals-St. Louis-New Orleans-Detroit-New York-West Coast blues-rock-R&B axis. Most of the songs here are top notch, with ""(Ain't Nothin' But A) Houseparty"", ""Southside Shuffle"", and the reggae-tinged ""Give It To Me"" standing out as particular highlights. Any serious fan of rock and/or R&B should own BLOODSHOT."
4,Great hard-rocking R&B from legendary Boston band,"Though front-man Peter Wolf's manic live performances may have been the band's visual signature, their albums offered up the sort of well-schooled rock/blues/R&B that only comes through countless nights on the road. This, their third studio LP (and fourth LP overall), was a peak moment, combining a well-picked cover of The Show Stoppers' ""Ain't Nothin' But a House Party"" with eight originals. The balance towards original compositions (their first two studio LPs had more covers) shows the band to have absorbed their influences, rather than aping them. The songs range from all-out rockers to funky shuffles to emotional ballads. Throughout the band provides terrific support, perhaps most of all from the harp of Magic Dick, reaching many a soulful groove."
3,Excellent J. Geils at their most raucous,"This lp rates three stars in relation to 'Ladies Invited' (5), Nightmares (4) and Full House (4) and is on par with their Hotline. As there are Amazon music samples for this album I won't comment much on their sound but to say that their sound was the definitive 'House Band' music for industrial Northeastern and Midwest America during the 1970's. It was full on R&B honky tonk soul rock and roll for blue collar and college party USA and it is a great sound. Anyone who saw J. Geils in their day will speak of the event with mist in their eyes for they apparently had a live act like few others. This album captures a lot of that energy which is kinetic. It's likely that you'll have heard at least one of the tunes contained on this album somewhere along the line even though the band's music doesn't get radio play anymore because when one of the J. Geil's band's songs hit it right their sound was timeless and outtasight."
3,Robot replica Bumblebee.,This toy is good looking and highly poseable.However it doesnt transform.Otherwise its a pretty good toy.
2,does NOT transform!!,"Okay, it's a TRANSFORMER right?? It should change into something?? NOPE. It's a ""robot replica"" and is just a robot. BOO!! HISS!! Why would you even produce a NON-TRANSFORMING Transformer??Plus, you take off his whole arm to put on the gun. Like you aren't going to lose either the arm, the gun, or both.That being said, my son got it as a gift from a friend, and he really does LIKE the toy, it just doesn't transform."
2,"For C++, possibly good - for .NET knowledge, thumbs down","I have the first edition of this book. If you are looking for a book that presents the new features of .NET in VC++ this isn't the book for you. This book covers the aspects of C++ only (touching on some MFC (blech). There are better books out there for learning C++, and there are better .NET books out there than this. Pass on this one."
2,"Not Accurate, but somewhat useful","The information is innacurate and/or so brushed over as to be frustrating. The book is filled with walk-along examples, which are good for beginning programmers, but lacks good editing, especially of code examples that you follow along with.I think the target audience is beginning programmers who want to read one book and be able to write crummy windows applications in a point & click style.A good starting point, but you will NOT master C++ using this book."
5,Love,They are avery full sheet labels which are great when you need to make your own size labels and don't need the provided sizes they have
4,Great for custom labeling projects,These labels are great for any household labeling needs. You can easily cut out any size and shape. I used them to make labels for cables in my home theater set up. Worked perfectly.
5,They work great!!,"Stick well, can't see through them at all. Easy to peel. Would definitely buy again! I just set the printer to print no receipt, cut the first invoice and then use the other half for another label. Works great!"
5,"Great Product, really sticks","I have used other labels before for my business, and they barely stick. These labels are a bit thicker and stick very well. The only downside to that, is that you have to make sure you stick them to the right place the first time. Repositioning is tough. That said, they print up well, have never jammed my very expensive laser printer and that is the reason I am reordering some right now."
4,Strong and serviceable,"My original contractor-grade handles gave up the ghost, so I simply wanted replacements at an affordable price. These do the job perfectly and were simple to install. The four stars is only because they are not top-of-the-line, but I didn't like the more expensive ones anyway."
1,faulty product,I got this phone less than a year ago and it has already broken twice. Verizon has given me a free new phone twice because the product malfunctioned. They told me the last time that they have had a lot of problems with this product and they recommend a different phone when I am eligible. I have a few friends who have had problems with theirs also. Apparently the reason LG came out with the new chocolate is because this one was so bad.
2,TOOK ONE YEAR TO GO CRAZY!,"I bought the Strawberry Chocolate one year ago and now it's starting to do things it never did before. It dials number out of my contacts when it's in my purse at least once a day.... When I'm out, I hear the voice command mode turn itself on and it's telling me to ""say a command"".The touch screen in getting harder and harder to touch...I loved this phone up until a couple weeks ago. Now I hate it and have to wait one more year to get a new phone......ARGHHHHH!"
5,Strawberry Chocolate Phone,I love this product. Very easy to navigate. Sometimes unlocks keypad in pocket but other than that it is awesome and I have not had a problem with service yet.
3,Pretty Good; It Has It's Pros and Cons,"I'd have to say this phone is pretty good overall; it has it's pros and cons, however.The pros: The sound, camera/picture quality and the Chocolate's video are amazing... not to mention it has a bit of musical capability and looks like a little pink i-pod.The cons: The keys have to be pressed somewhat firmly to get them to work properly, which is a hassle if you're a multi-tasking type of person and, if pressed too hard, the key could break and refuse to preform properly.Also, the design is incredibly not break-proof. Let's see... the sliding keypad design could easily break even from a simple drop; seeing as it isn't very well attached.I have to say, it has about as much cell-phone capability as an i-pod...maybe even less.If you want a long-lasting cellular phone, DON'T buy this one!"
1,An unendurable noodlefest,"As R G-S has already said, the Miles Davis version of IN A SILENT WAY is far better than Joe's version. This is a painfully dull record. I wish Joe had written some thru-written stuff instead of boring me to tears with these aimless improvisations. HIS LAST JOURNEY is a bit of low-key impressionism that might interest you if you're a fan of Richard Strauss's tone-poems. (Luckily, I'm not.)"
5,This one's brutal!,"Exodus is back with an amazing rap killing, hip hop destroying, techno massacring thrash powerhouse album. This album is metal right to the core, brutal, fast, and an attack on the sences. Exodus rules, play it loud!"
4,Good Thrash but not Exodus,"Imagine a band that has re-vitalized itself with a classic sounding album with a (nearly) classic line-up a few years ago (Tempo of the Damned). Imagine that you loose the singer (Steve - Retro - Souza), one of the guitar players (Rick Hunolt) and the drummer (Tom Hunting) from that comeback. What do u do? For Gary Holt the answer was simple.Recruit Paul Bostaph (ex Slayer and Forbidden), recruit a fit thrash guitarist (Lee Altus, ex-Heathen) find a new singer Rob Dukes. And go on...Although the name is still Exodus, the sound is Exodus no more. No offence to the guys. This is AGGRESSIVE, angry and pure thrash. No doubt that this is metal. A good album with classic thrashy riffs, good vocals, good drumming. It is not a slow album also. This is pure Bay Area Thrash with roots in the underground scene. Why 4 stars? Because it does not sound like Exodus..."
4,Heavy,"Yeah this CD is heavy alright and Rob Dukes vocals are killer but it kind of loses the feel of an actual ""Exodus"" CD. I thought that Tempo Of The Damned was a better CD than this and featured Steve on vocals. This is a great CD, but I don't think it feels like Exodus as Tempo of the Damned lived up to"
5,Shovel Review,"This is a great thrash album, one of the best in the past decade. It is not better then Tempo of the Damned, it will never grow on me or somehow get better either lol. Tempo is much more melodic and the guitar solos are a lot stronger. The lyrics on this album are also a little more lacking.Because Tempo of the Damned is such a damn good album, and many people will STILL rate this one based on tempo I give this one a 9.5/10 based on ALL thrash metal.The album is still in that funky drop D tuning, the vocalist is alright, he definently changes an element in the band, if you like exodus, buy it."
5,Holy S**t!!!!!,"I was upset when I found out that the mighty Exodus had made a change in the vocalist area since ""Tempo..."" but Holy F**k I couldn't believe my ears!!! I'm a diehard Exodus fan so I was kinda skeptical but as soon as ""Raze"" came on I was Thrashed! This is definitely their most brutal recording ever!! Every song on here will smash your face like a hammer!! A Kick to the nutz!!Buy it!!!"
4,Worth the listen!!!,"Name it modern thrash or old school thrash, but this album is really good!!! In my opinion not better than TOTD, but great in their own. I'm a little bit of dissapointed because the departure of Rick Hunolt and Steve Souza, but Lee Altus, Paul Bostaph and Rob Dukes are great replacements!!!!"
3,Paul Bostaph still the man,"It's too bad Paul got stuck with the guys. Exodus was a great band but everyone worth a crap left. The restructure of this band is definitely in its beginning stages. I've tried to like the cd but no such luck. The songs run on with their garage band sound. Same old Exodus trademark riffs with pretty well done lead guitar. But what pisses me off most is that the talent of Paul Bostaph is wasted with unoriginal and lame song writing. I think people need to listen to these songs and rate them accordingly. Don't give em 5 stars because you think there ""cool""."
2,Average Thrash Metal,"I was really looking forward to this release. All I can say is that I am very disappointed in it after all the hype I read online. Rob Dukes is a very average vocalist. He is way to monotone in his vocalizations. Everything he does is pretty much the same tempo, no screams and no yells and the same vocal phrasing style in every song. The riffs are pretty generic as well. I've listened to this several times and I can't remember one song where with Tempo of the Damned every song was memorable and catchy with that monster Exodus groove. All in all, I'm not to happy with this release."
1,Sorry Folks...,"This is NOT EXODUS! Yeah, Gary Holt is present but it's like he's appearing on another bands cd. No Hunolt, No Hunting on drums. Great cd, but they NEED to change the name of the band. THIS IS NOT EXODUS!!!!!"
4,Pure Thrash!,"Exodus still thrashing at the top level! this is one of the original 4 with slayer,metallica & megadeth. Love this cd Rob Dukes has a great ferocity in his voice & is a great addition to the band. I will be looking forward to more great things from this band!"
2,Fell apart in the box,I just received my mud pan and one of the blades had fallen out before I had even taken it out of the box. I will glue it back together but that's pretty sad. I gave it an extra pitty star since it is so cheap.
4,Comprehensive Overview,"This book, edited by Judith Plaskow and Carol Christ, is an overview of current trends in Feminist Spirituality. This volume attempts to cover many different forms of feminist spirituality including Judaism, Christianity, Pagan, and Native American. It also examines various trends and special areas that are of a concern in feminist theology. Being as comprehensive as it is, I was disappointed that there was no mention of Islam within the book. For me, that was the difference between 4 stars and 5 stars."
2,Weakest of the bunch,"I love Alex Kava, but this book is the weakest of the Maggie O'Dell series. People are forgotten in the book and never reapper, it seems as if the ending was rushed."
2,Not a Mystery,"Sorry to disagree with all the enthusiastic reviews, but this novel has much more interest as a slight character study than any sort of mystery. The killer's identity is pretty much concealed by the author not by the story.Kava does spend some effort building up sympathy for a large number of characters, and, in part, does it well. I found her description of life from the point of view of a victim of early onset Alzheimers to be quite haunting."
3,Growing Pains,"Alex Kava's first and third books in the Maggie O'Dell series are fresh and crisp. Lamentably, the second and this, the fourth, are transitional pieces that take more than a few plays from Thomas Harris and his Hannibal Lecter. Prior reviewers have already divulged more than you need to know about this book before you ""Just Read It!"" Clarice (er- FBI Agent/profiler Maggie) is back and a Hannibal-wannabe has killed a bunch of disparate disabled denizens and left their ""improved"" bodies in barrels at a Connecticut quarry.It might be a good idea to read the prior books in this series first, but, if you don't, at least you won't be disappointed that There Is No Nick! (To know Nick is to love him, but he is not to be found under these covers.) Harvey (no, he's not a 6 foot sometimes-invisible rabbit) *is* here, but there is foreboding that he might be going to another foster family in the next episode.Reviewed by TundraVision, Amazon reviewer."
3,Another thrilling installment to the Maggie O'Dell series!,"This one had a bit more guesswork to the plot than some of the previous books, though I must admit, in the end all of my guesses turned out to be correct. As far as character development, this one felt quite disappointing. Maggie has not grown, and continues to make the same mistakes, and what had seemed like the central romance has not progressed at all. Still, it was an exciting read - certainly fast-paced but it felt shorter. I am still really enjoying the series, even if this was not its strongest book."
3,Not bad,This is the first Alex Kava book I have read. It was recommended by a sales person at a local mystery book store. I thought it was a good book but it took too long to get interesting. The majority of the book was set up and it only really got good and became a page turner in the last 70 pages. A long time to wait for the good stuff. I was on my toes as to whodunnit though and that I enjoyed.
4,Love it!,I just happen to stumble upon the last book of alex kava while vacationing. It was so good that i had to go back to the beginning and read them all. This is by far one of my favorites. It is one of the more gruesome books. I love how you are starting to see the progression between gwen and tully. Love it. Read it!
5,Book and Condition Review,Delivery was prompt. Book was in excellent condition. Thanks very much.Elton
2,Print,It just looks like a cheap tee. The graphics aren't impressive. My husband is a big fan of Metallica but he's owned this shirt for two months and has never worn it. The shirt itself isn't thin or see thru so I think it'll wash up well. It's just the graphic itself that I'm not thrilled about.
5,love it,"metallica master tees, I have many many, and this model is super coolmetallica all shirts are awesomeand this, very good value for money and above all the design"
2,Be careful not a bravado,"I recently purchased this product and when i put it on it felt really soft then i checked the brand and it said hanes, very disapinted to be honest it still looks cool but im not sure if its gonna last long"
1,your chest hair maybe sanded away by this shirt,"Shirt received promptly, but the shirt neck hole was way too small. I snagged on my adams apple and I choked. After I was able to squeeze my head through, the shirt felt like sand paper (all parts). Do yourself a favor and buy a true Master t-shirt. And sorry Goodwill, this shirt is coming your way!"
4,Fun Christmas Movie,The story was sweet as well as entertaining and had the happy ending we all hope for. Probably would have more appeal to women than to men to watch. I really enjoyed it.
3,Good Movie,"The movie Christmas Mail was cute and I liked it. A nice heart warming Christmas tale. However, the end came a little too fast. I would recommend it for any fan of Christmas movies."
2,CUTE - BUT.........,"COMPARED TO OTHER HOLIDAY MOVIES, THIS ONE WAS SO-SO. THE ACTING WASN'T THE BEST. BOTTOM LINE - I WOULDN'T SPEND $22.99 ON IT. I'LL WAIT UNTIL IT IS IN THE $5.00 BIN. I DON'T SPEND $22.00 ON BLOCKBUSTER MOVIES. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
2,"cheesy scripts, over acting on some parts","I thought this movie was very cheesy in the script, and some of the characters over acted their parts. Overall my impression was of an amateur production. The story line was good, just not delivered well."
1,Disappointed very slow movie,I am sorry but the beginning of this movie was very slow and dull for adults and probably for children too. Towards the ending it moved much faster and the acting was much better. I overall do not recommend this as a Christmas Favorite to watch every year. Ashley Scott did a great job as Santas daughter. Price quite high. Movie in general. Thumbs down.
2,"Plot good, acting not so good","I put this on my wish list, because this seemed like the sort of movie I would like. It happened to come on t.v. before I bought and boy am I glad. The movie had so much potential, but the acting was so over the top it made me cringe and change the station several times. I am not saying don't buy the movie, but just be forwarned."
5,Great book on nutrition and the PD patient.,"One of the most enlightening books I've read regarding Parkinson's Disease. Focusing on nutrition and what your body is going through with PD, it is a primer for what to watch out for, how to deal with dietary challenges, and what to expect. This book will help you make a nutritional game plan, and prepare a pre-emptive strike against most of the common surprises PD throws at you. I don't suffer from PD - I'm a family member. It was great for me and great for my family PD-er. I recommend this book to everyone interested in living better with Parkinson's."
5,"Durable, and cute!","Daughter loves this tent. The tunnel comes off anytime without any effort. She can turn it over, lay on it, pull, etc - and nothing happens to it. Very, very durable. Once you put it together, you dont need to worry about the stakes coming loose either. Other info: She is 2 years old, but the product is for 3 and up. And she, my husband AND I can sit in it and play together. It's very roomy!"
1,Dodger onesie,"I was very disappointed with this product. Not only was the sizing way off but the Dodgers emblem on the front of the shirt was placed on the stomach area rather than on the upper chest like most emblems are on a shirt. In addition, the emblem started to peel off after only 1-2 washes. Very disappointed."
5,For all young ladies,"I highly recommend this book, whether you are a dedicated Christian, or just beginning your walk with Christ. I truly appreciated the wisdom and maturity--and yet humility--of Jennifer Lamp. Just knowing that she is also a young lady in the midst of the very challenges she is writing about was a huge encouragment! The practical insights and resource guides also are invaluable. Visit her family's website about their ministry (His Grace Works) for more information. I am recommending this gem to every young lady I know!"
5,T-shirt was perfect,I would recommend this site for their prompt service and fine quality. Thank you
3,German Soundalikes?,"There's little information provided about this album, no artist name and the liner notes are non-existent, so the only clue to its origin is the distribution information on the back cover, which lists a German record label. So I'm going to guess that this is a German tribute band, placed squarely in ""soundalike"" territory. There are some variations on the Beatles' arrangements, but some may be due to mixing the harmonies to be as prominent as the lead vocals.Actually, I'm sure they're German, because Germans are stereotypically methodical, and the songs on this album are mostly in alphabetical order, for some reason.There are some minor spelling problems on the label, most notably ""Back in the URSS"". Don't worry, in the song the lyrics are correct. I do feel, however, that the best Beatles covers CDs are the ones that bring something new to the table, and this album doesn't really deliver on that point."
