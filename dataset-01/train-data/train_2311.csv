5,Excellent Value,"There's not too much one can say about a pitcher and some glasses. They look as good in person as they did in the photo. I gave this item five stars because I thought it was an excellent value.And yes, I know it's just my mind playing tricks on me, but it really does seem like margaritas taste better in margarita glasses than they do in plan, run-of-the-mill glasses."
3,Print is too small,I lived in Bologna for five years and this is an informative book.I wish the print were larger. One needs a magnifying glass or strong reading glasses to read in comfort.
2,No cassettes,This is the second time i've had this happen but with a different company. I think Amazon has it titled wrong. There was a book but no cassettes. Doesn't do me much good as I need a lot of help with the pronounciation.
2,"Well written, but R rated reading material","While this book was very well written, the thematic elements and language are strong. Among the thematic elements are murder, prostitution, rape, incest, adultery.....the strong language and incessent references to prostitution were too much for me."
3,¿Quién mató a Palomino Molero?,I expected a better narrative from Mario Vargas Llosa. It's mediocre novel that lacks to grasp the attention of the reader.
2,"Wrong flavors, little variety","I expected to receive the flavors listed for the variety pack:Blue MoonButter PecanChocolateOrange Custard Chocolate ChipStrawberryVanillaI don't know what Blue Moon is but all the other flavors looked very appealing, and I particularly wanted a premium vanilla ice cream to pair with a high quality balsamic vinegar.Unfortunately I only received two of the above flavors - Blue Moon and Chocolate. I got two other chocolate varieties (Mint Chocolate Cookie and Chocolate Turtle), a Fudge Marble and a Caramel Capuccino. So, three chocolates and a fudge, one coffee-flavored (sadly I don't like coffee-flavored anything, other than coffee itself) and a Blue Moon.Overall, two stars for shipping the wrong stuff with little variety. However I might bump up the star rating once I've ate the ice cream.UpdateNothing special about the ice cream. Not bad, but no better than store-bought stuff and a heck of a lot more expensive."
1,Wasted my money,"I bought this because it was very discounted. But unfortunately the dvd is cheaply produced and edited, so you won't get to see the movements as you should. Also the instructor is very dull and boring to watch, so definitly you won't be watching this video more than once (if so).Adding to this, the dvd came scratched and won't play. Very poor product."
2,The knife attacked me.,"Great size, fit in my pocket nicely.The spring action is a bit aggressive and you have to cautiously think about opening it. I carry a pocket knife everyday for the last 15+ years, but this knife deserves respect.A month or so of carrying it, I used it to open a box, and then (while talking to someone) I went to close the blade. Unfortunately for me, I had it upside down and instead of pressing on the back of the blade, I pressed my thumb down on the business side. It effortlessly sliced my thumb, until I realized what was happening and it went flying across the room. Since then, it's been in a time-out in my dresser cabinet and I've been carrying an old folding knife of my grandfathers.I assumed I was mature enough in my late 30's to handle any pocket knife.............I was sorely mistaken.Purchase with caution, Respect the blade."
4,VERY GOOD,"DIo recorded two great metal albuns: HOLY DIVER and this ""LAST IN LINE"". After guitarrist Vivian Campbell left, nothing was never the same again ..."
5,"Dio, The Greatest Singer Ever","This was my second CD I got from Dio when it 1st came out. Now, since the passing of Ronnie James Dio, I wanted to make sure I had this metal classic in my collection. Long Live Rock n Roll Ronnie! Thank you amazon for the prompt shipping."
4,Just a Notch Below Its Predecessor,"Dio's second album Last in Line was a lil' glossier than their bullet-proof debut, Holy Diver, and featured the awful wannabe pop single ""Mystery"" but it's pretty damned good overall. If the album-opening ""We Rock"" doesn't hit quite as hard as Holy Diver's ""Stand Up and Shout,"" it certainly has its own majestic rush, not to mention a nice sentiment of inclusiveness. We rock! You can't go wrong with that. Elsewhere, the soaring title track, with its soft/loud suckerpunch opening, and the sensual ""One Night in the City"" certainly stand among Dio's finest songs.Some of Last in Line borders on what critics would call ""by-the-numbers craftsmanship"" (songs like ""Breathless"" and ""Evil Eyes"" are the kind of tunes Dio can write in his sleep) but hell, it all sounds so good you hardly care."
4,Jumping ahead of the punters,"After the great ""Holy Diver,"" Dio came back with another hard rocking album. However, it was a minor case of the sophomore slumps. After all, there's only so many times you can use the words fire and rainbow before you're making albums that turn into drinking games.But the heavy riffing, courtesy of Vivian Campbell, still pulverizes with the best of 80's metal, and the title track rocked a great video. There's the super-speed metal of ""I Speed At Night"" and the epic riff that carries ""Egypt."" The band had added a keyboardist and he added to the band's sound, beefing up the title track and turning a good hook in ""Mystery,"" the obvious sounding single.The single may be the most easy-to-catch evidence that Dio always had a way with melody that the metal often disguised. It's what distinguished ""Holy Diver"" and ""The Lest In Line"" (but started to overwhelm by ""Sacred Heart"") from run of the mill 80's hard rockers."
5,"Dio, Last in Line","Ronnie James Dio ruled in the 80's and Last in Line is his second best work only to Holy Diver. That album can never be outdone, but Last in Line comes real close. There are many good tracks on this album. A good rocking album, very enjoyable. Check out the MTV video for Last in Line - awesome. Highly recommended."
3,A good follow-up,"This is not quite as good as ""Holy Diver"", but it is a nice follow-up. I remember it really solidified Dio as a metal force in the mid-80's after the buzz created by ""Holy Diver"".There are a few weaker tracks, but ""We Rock"" does and ""Egypt (The Chains Are On)"" is a masterful epic. ""Evil Eyes"" is quite fine, too.I like the title track even though it is from the same cookie-cutter as ""Children of the Sea"" and ""Sign of the Southern Cross"". Similarly, ""Mystery"" does kind of a pop twist on ""Rainbow in the Dark"", and it is not good.Anyway, this is pretty good, but if you are new to Dio, you would be better served to pick up his stuff with Rainbow or Black Sabbath. Vivian Campbell is good, but he's no match for Blackmore or Iommi."
2,Not that Good Sound quakity,"I have Dio's first solo album, Holy Diver (24K Gold) and the sound quality is good. But this one, not so good sound quality."
1,"Frankly, it's all very boring","Frankly, it's all very boring. The lyrics are no better, he writes about gnomes, trolls, dark elves and evil forests. It's obvious the guy played D & D (Dungeons & Dragons ) in the early 80's and probably has an oujia board in his closet. His voice is excruciatingly annoying, he whines through all the songs and then there are the corny guitar solos that make me want to puke. On one song they are even bold enough to add keyboards like a bunch of other crap 80's metal bands that didn't know where to go music wise. Most metal heads think this junk is classic but its not worth your time, that is, if you are a truly sane person."
1,Save your money.,"Friends, I'm here to tell you that this is awful, simply horrible music. His voice is dreadful. I'd rather listen to a dog barking all night long then to sit through this dreary dullsfest. Who listens to this anymore anyway, '80s metal just has zero appeal to me and most of my friends, we all used to like this, but something so silly is easy to outgrow. The only '80s metal that still hold up is Slayer, and even when Dio was popular, his best (except for the first ""Blackmore's Rainbow"" album) is not as good as Slayer's worst. And that includes his days in Black Sabbath, no wonder Tony Iommi kicked him out, compared to Ozzy, he made Sabbath look and sound silly."
5,Dio's FINEST EVER!!!,"FINALLY, the DEFINITIVE Dio albums/Cd's have been given the 21st-Century upgrade they so rightfully deserve!! ABOUT TIME!! LOVE the chiming keyboards on the title track!! ""We Rock"", ""One Night In The City"", ""Evil Eyes"", and ""Egypt(The Chains Are On) are also CERTIFIED classics!!!"
5,Nice Sound,"Finally, after hearing the improvement in sound on the Holy Diver 24K cd release, this one lives up to the audio enhancements. A killer record now sounding oohh, so much better"
1,A tragedy to all fans of the show!!!!,"As it's been written previously...this is not the complete first season! I brought it before there were any reviews and now I feel robbed. I'm a big fan of the series but I'm reluctant to purchase any more of the so called ""COMPLETE"" anything from this otherwise wonderful show. This is not the way you treat fans!"
5,cartoon,such a cute lil cartoon selection for ages 5 and up my brother loved it and its really cool :)
3,Can't believe I didn't realize it wasn't the full first season.,"The DVD set although nice is NOT the full first season but the first half of it. I cannot believe I bought this thinking it was the full first season. I find the title of the DVD set to be a bit misleading, but it is only my own fault for buying it."
1,Excellent Show! Terrible Releases so Far!,"Wait for a real Season 1 release. Don't buy this. This is an excellent show that deserves a better DVD format for fans who have been following this series. So far they have put out 3 volumes and now this 3 disc set, which isn't even a full season. This is another senseless money grab to take advantage of loyal fans."
1,Wont Buy Until Full Season 1,"WB I have not seen one episode of this show and I am truly dying to watch it. Here is one of those people (like others in this forum) who buy your releases on day (or week) one. I have been sitting here for like 6 months waiting for you to put out the entire first season and stop jerking us with the 3 episodes per dvd when the season contains 20 + eps.I will not buy this (as many other feel) until you put out the eitire season. If this means i have to spend my money on content from the other big comic company (Xmen Anime ""entire"" Season 1 $14 - Iron Man Anime ""entire"" Season 1 $14) Then I will.Please just put the stuff out in a way that works for the buyer, and we will buy it. its that easy.And kill that ""ultraviolet"" 3D copy program too...."
4,Combination pack,Sad that this is a combination pack of three other discs but at least it's all in one for once. It got here fast and it had all the discs with half the season's episodes.
4,Great series,This what I wanted the Teen Titans animated series to be like. Solid animation and so far great stories.Well worth watching if your a DC animated fan.
5,Cartoon Network Canceling Young Justice,Cartoon Network Canceling Young Justice This Will Be The Last Season For Young Justice Invasion. Also Cartoon Network Is Canceling Green Lantern The Animated Series Also.
5,ONE OF THE FINEST SINGERS OF THE 60'S!,"IT BLEW ME AWAY WHEN I SAW THAT THIS C.D. HAD BEEN RELEASED!I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST HEARD ""TAKE ME FOR A LITTLE WHILE"" ON THE RADIO.WOW!!THEN SHE HAD ""ANY WAY THAT YOU WANT ME"" ANOTHER GREAT SONG OF THE 60'S.SHE HAD A BEAUTIFUL VOICE BUT WAS MISMANAGED BECAUSE YOU NEVER SAW PHOTOS OF HER,OR ANY OF THE OTHER GIRLS WHO SANG FOR THE RED BIRD LABEL, IN ANY MAGAZINES.THESE ARE HARD-TO-FIND RECORDS, SO I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS C.D. AS AN INVESTMENT OR SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S GREAT!THIS IS THE 60'S GIRL SOUND AT IT BEST!"
3,Good for the price,This glassware is priced well and looks pretty nice. The glassware is slightly shorter in height than the Spiegelau style Pilsner glasses but is still a solid buy.
3,shipped damaged glass,I like the glasses but was very disappointed that the base of one of the glasses arrived broken. There was no glass in the box so it is obvious it was shipped from the factory. It really would have been a big deal but when I called for the replacement. I needed to email them pictures of the broken glass. I will not be ordering from Bealls Florida again.
1,seller does not care,Purchased these glasses 2 weeks ago and were disappointed on their arrival as one was totally broken to pieces and the 3 others were intact. Seller did not package them correctly as the box of glasses was mix in a larger box with just balls of plastic wrap around it no bubble wrap! Tried to contact seller many times on sending a replacement or refund but no response from the seller. I guess I am stuck with just 3 glasses. Better to just buy the same glasses at Walmart or Target pretty much the same price after the seller includes shipping/handling (which was unexceptable) and taxes. PJC179
4,"Not bad, but not a real album","Four songs from ""Construction Time Again,"" one from ""A Broken Frame,"" one from ""Some Great Reward,"" with only three new songs...not bad. This CD is more like a Promo for Depeche Mode music. Something to convince club owners to play their music. ""Everything Counts,"" ""Love In Itself,"" ""People Are People,"" ""Now This is Fun,"" and ""Leave In Silence"" are the best ones. ""Pipeline"" is a little...stupid. ""Told You So"" isn't too bad, and ""Work Hard"" is interesting. ""Get The Balance Right"" is pretty good too. Overall, maybe not worth the money, but its something to dance to, and it some of Depeche Mode's better songs anyway. Besides...it's Depeche Mode...how can you go wrong?"
1,Unnecessary,"When this album came out, it was basically a compilation of tracks released just in the States working around the hit ""People Are People"". It also worked as a companion piece to CATCHING UP,the compilation acting as the American singles collection. Today, with SINGLES 81-85 rleased in America, this has become really unnecessary. All of the singles on the album can be found on that collection and the others (very weak, too) can be found on other albums. Completists should only bother."
2,Dated and unnecessary compilation,"""People Are People"" was the ""album"" made for the US when the title song broke the band through stateside and served a purpose to get people into the group. However, the best one-disc representation of the group isThe Best of Depeche Mode, Vol. 1, which has a span of the group's 25-year career (by that point). You may not own those, but just get the remastered versions ofA Broken FrameandConstruction Time Again. That being said, most of this can be recommended, but this is irrelevant in 2007. I will never completely vilify anything with ""Everything Counts"" on it, so I won't give anything with that song 1 stars. Besides, it isn't THAT bad, but it's just not worth it considering what else is out there."
4,Fast read.,"Compared to the UNSEEN HAND, Epperson's book is much less condensed. It is a good book to challenge what you always believed about history. Obviously ten years has since passed since written and there is much more to be said about an actual New World Order now than before. 8/10 stars."
4,Not bad at all,I'm just under half way through this book and so far I am enjoying it. Not my favorite book about the New World Order but definitely worth a read
3,NWO? Probably Not...,"With ""The New World Order"" writer A. Ralph Epperson has picked up entirely where his last book ""The Unseen Hand"" left off, and that is attempting to prove a worldwide conspiracy to create a New World Order, and the complete destruction of Christian ideology.Epperson attempts to link everything from Communism, to the New Age Movement with Satan Worship, and the policies of annihilation.It isn't that this isn't an interesting read, it is indeed, but he really attempts to make connections out of ideas and subjects that if researched by an individual would prove to be entirely unrelated.As a person I am fully convinced that there are a number of conspiracies being hidden from the eyes, and ears of the general public, but Epperson attempts so strongly to make a conspiracy out of everything, which really makes him look more of a paranoid schizophrenic than a serious researcher and historian."
3,Epperson missed the mark,"This book had great potential to be a real blockbuster, but because of Epperson lack of scholorship this book missed the mark. On one hand I will have to give Mr. Epperson credit because he obtain a lot of sources for this book, but because he use so many I began to question if any of these quotes were taken out of context. This is a issue that really needs to be seriously look at, but it has to be studied very carefully. The facts need to come via first person or second person. The most groud breaking books about masons or satanist have come from people that were actually involved with either of the two. Epperson is a outsider and the depth of this book proves it.Now I am not saying that what Epperson is trying to bring out is not good because it is. Base on what Epperson attemped to bring out in this book, the Freemasons and those that pratice witch craft need to be taken more seriously."
1,I wish you had a rating for zero stars,This book was absolute garbage...the 'reader from Australia' captured my sentiments exactly. I only wish I'd read other online reviews before I made this purchase.
4,A few more details about this headband.,"This a perfectly nice headband, but it's a little smaller than average.The product page doesn't give much information so I thought I'd fill in the gaps.The headband is light to medium pile terry cloth (lighter than the Gamma-Elite, about the same as the GOGO). It's 5 3/4"" long (inside length) unstretched, and the elastic, while good quality, doesn't stretch as much as some others (thus the small size). It's actually 1 5/8"" wide (plus pile).So far it seems to have survived the washing machine just fine."
1,Smell don't last,Well I gave it a star because the bottle looks nice but other then that . I think I got a fake bottle smell don't last no more then 5 hrs I men for the price this thing should last all day if its the original but next time I'm just gonna go to joe brand and pay 250.00 for the real thing.
5,"Sturdy, yet Light Weight. Simple assembly. Perfect!","Perfect music stand.I have been using a fold-able, flimsy music stand. My pieces would fall off and it was simply annoying.This stand looks bulky and heavy, but is rather light weight. It is very sturdy and was very simple to assemble - 1 bolt to tighten!I just ordered the ""stand-out shelf extenders"" in order to hold four pages comfortably. I also recommend the floor protectors if you plan on using on hardwoods.My rating: A+"
5,riven:the sequel to myst,"I really love this game it's an absolute classic. Awesome graphics and sound, good story line and the challenging puzzles make a must have for classic playstation lover."
5,"If you have sinus problems, try this.",For people with really bad allergies this is an item you want to try. After I used this product I felt like I could breathe more freely.
2,"Great, but doesn't fit all models as advertised.","Would work great, except...this doesn't fit my new WaterPik Ultra (WP-100)."
1,Not for newer Waterpiks.,"I purchased this set of attachments and a ""Waterpik NEW Professional Ultra Dental Water Jet"" from Amazon last week. These tips will not work in this Waterpik. The base of the tip, the end inserted into the Waterpik handle, is too small. Both tips in this set are too small.Not really worth sending back to Amazon so I think I'll just use my trusty Dremel tool and some plastic cement to swap the base with one of the tips that came with the Waterpik."
3,Sinus Rinse Attachment,"This works if you just want to rinse out your nose of pollen and dirt, but it does not reach the sinus as the regular squeeze bottle. This is only my opinion as I have had to rinse my sinus for 3 years, due to severe sinus infections."
1,Not fully-compatible,"Although the product information claims that this works with all models of WaterPik irrigation system, it does not work with the WP-360 Cordless WaterPik. This seems like a major oversight on the part of the designers, as sinus irrigation doesn't require that much water and the WP-360's reservoir seems to be just about the right capacity for this task."
1,Amazon Stop Selling Items You Don't Have!,"My one star rating is for Amazon's service, not the WaterPik attachment, which I never received. Despite the fact that I ordered this on 20 February 2007 and shipping was stated to be 7-9 days (and is still stated to be 7-9 days), TWO weeks later Amazon has contacted me that shipping on this item will not be until 5-9 April 2007. I have canceled the item and ordered from another internet store and should receive this in a few days.In my many years ordering from Amazon, I have found it's best not to order any items with any type of shipping delay, as shipping almost always takes far longer than promised. I don't understand why Amazon can't keep better track of their inventory."
3,A Traveler's Guide to Germany - Part Two,The four part DVD is quite good especially the South Germany and Romantic Road videos. The Bavarian Forest sound quality is however quite poor.
3,Content is good - Writing is BAD,"I'm amazed that a book can be so important and yet be written so poorly. The content is almost overshadowed by the pedantic, fragmented, toe-curlingly dull writing. Read it. Take away the message. Hold your nose."
4,satisfied,"The book is just what I expected. It is very informative. It's good for info-hungry kids like my 6-year-old son. It covers a lot of information, but is an easy read."
2,Bad quality,"I bought this TV/DVD combo a few months ago. First, it swallowed my DVD and refused to give it back. I had to return it to the store for replacement and pay for the lost DVD to Netflix. Now, after about six months, the replacement unit is also broken - it is stuck on channel 5 (Fox, to make matters worse), and refuses to change the channel. I am trying to send it to Toshiba for repair, but their website does not make it easy - the warranty information section sends you to (nonexistent) user manual, and there is no number to call. Don't buy it. Over the years, I owned several TV model - this is the first one to break, twice!"
1,Poor choice for trailer,"This TV came with our trailer. It looks nice enough (fairly plain), operates easily enough and has decent enough sound. Where it is really bad for us is the vertical angle. If you're in a trailer there is a good chance that it's mounted up high, and with this TV you start to lose quality immediately as your viewing angle drops. The manufacturer doesn't specify viewing angles, I'd be interested to see what they consider this to have. But our TV is up with the cabinets and it's totally unwatchable sitting on any of the seats in the trailer. You either stand or you get up on the top bed to view it. My negative rating is based solely on this feature so if that's not a consideration for you then don't worry about it. The horizontal angle is okay, by the way."
1,"Toshiba 19HLV87 19"" LCD HDTV with Built-In DVD Player-DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX","I had the same thing happen to me. After the unit was programmed for channels in my area, it froze up and the TV did not respond to the remote or the actual controls on the TV. Followed the recommended steps of unplugging for ten minutes however this did not help. There is no reset button on the TV. The manual is very poorly written. I did not purchase the unit through amazon this time but I felt it was important to write a review because as you can see this is identical to the review before me. I hope Toshiba can fix this problem. I will hold off buying another until more research is done."
2,"I really wanted to like the Toshiba, but . . .",". . . out of the box it had problems. The DVD player had a line of dots across the bottom of the screen. It would come and go, but was evident even when a DVD wasn't inserted, i.e., on the splash screen.Also, the component inputs were defective. I tried them with three different component sources and all I could get was a green, grainy screen. The HDMI input worked fine, but I really wanted to be able to use the component, since that's what my cable provider offers. Frankly, I expected better of Toshiba. I've got an ancient Toshiba tube TV which still works fine. This LCD was a disappointment. It went back."
4,Great TV but you need HD service,"My reasons for purchase: fits a small space on a bookshelf, has a built-in dvd player, HD enabled, and price. Also extremely easy to get out of the box and have up and running. But - my knowledgeable techie friend said I wouldn't be happy with the quality of the picture unless I upgraded to HD servie from my cable provider. He's right. I really saw the difference when I watched a DVD - very good picture. However, overall a good purchase because it met my needs even if the picture quality is not showroom worthy without HD service.."
5,Awesome!!,This DVD Rocks!! It has all of my favorite Christian Rock songs on it!! I recommend this DVD for everyone who enjoys this type of music!!
3,Just remember that I told you so ...,"The glasses to this set are very handsome and substantial in hand. But the pitcher is a bit wobbly until it is about half full with your beverage choice. I have purchased a similarly shaped pitcher from another name brand (which escapes my memory at present) that is very stable. The price is right however, and the pitcher seems stable when filled. It is a very serviceable piece of tableware."
4,Good set for the price!,"Nice and elegant, good size glasses also, able to pour a 12 ounce can into one. Seems a bit delicate, hope you don't have young kids at home. I did buy a set for myself and a set as a gift for a friend though.The pitcher started showing cracks by the handle after adding ice to hot liquid."
2,Pretty but doesn't hold up...,"When I purchased this set I just loved it. The pitcher is really pretty and the glasses are nice. However, I am down to three glasses. They crack easily and don't hold up to the dishwasher (heat from drying). I was really disappointed."
4,Nice housewarming gift,I got this set as a gift for my housewarming. The picture is misleading - the pitcher and glasses are completely clear with no smoky tint. They are fairly sturdy and have gone in the dishwasher several times now with no problems. I reserve them for special occasions but I imagine they could be used as your normal glassware if you wanted to.I agree with some of the other reviews that the tiny pool at the bottom of the glasses is annoying but I just pre-soak them a little if we had wine or anything like that before I put them in the dishwasher and they come out fine. Overall a nice set and I was glad to receive it as a gift.
2,For 007 Completists,"Sean Connery's final outing as James Bond deserved better music than Michel Legrand's erratic compositions for ""Never Say Never Again"" (1983). Legrand adds some nice jazz-oriented touches, but the soundtrack is marred by stylistic miscalculations and Lani Hall's horrible theme song. Though not the worst 007 score (Michael Kamen's ""Licence to Kill"" earns that ignoble distinction), this belated import will not convert any detractors."
5,One of the best Bond theme songs,"Lani Hall was under rated regarding the bond themes, Never Say Never is an excellent song and Lani Hall has an amazing voice"
4,"""It Certainly does need it""","I was sitting down eating some lunch and a friend called and said he was watching one of the Connery Bond Films I asked which one? He said Never Say Never Again, I had never heard of it, so I found the DVD and bought it. I loved it, even lacking the classics, Connery pulled off a great film. I also noticed the music, but it did not contain the Bond theme(couldn't get the rights to it), I love the Bond Theme, and this was like listening to the Moonraker soundtrack, it just wasn't right. How ever it was an enjoyable CD, it would have been great if it just had the Bond theme. If you could stand listening to the Moonraker soundtrack(how ever playing the Bond theme alot in the film!), then by all means pick this up(if you can find the damn thing!), you might like it."
2,A Mixed Bag,"Michel Legrand was Connery's idea. The producer was leaning toward James Horner. It is -- like the film uneven -- and ultimately, not very satisfying. It isn't just the lack of the Bond theme, it just doesn't have the kind of thematic thread that the Eon Films do. There are some jazzy elements and an awfully insipid title song sung by Herb Alpert's wife Lani Hall. Sticking on the opening action sequence with credits has to be one of the dumbest ideas in the history of dumb ideas. The poetential pre-credits sequence cried out for effective music and you get this lackluster, stupid theme song instead."
1,"Worst Audio cd,Ever...","I feel bad for anyone who thinks of this movie.IT IS NOT A BOND FILM.Not only does the movie lack all the other characters played by the original acters like moneypenny,M...etc,It's missing a soundtrack by John Barry,though even he could not make it work.There is a feeling however,that the music doesn't match the film itself,if you look at it as a normal film score,as it should be,it is not a bond film,you can enjoy it,while it is in no way equal to John Barrys work,It is just allright,if you put all that aside,it is ...not bad.If you are a bond fan-think twice,it is not a bond film.If you collect bond soundtracks-remember,it is not a bond film,rather misplaced,typical 80's music,which is allright,if your'e into it.This is not for bond fans,and if you think it is an adequete bond film you are not a bond fan,but if you like the 80's and their soundtracks this is for you.Just keep one thing in mind...THIS NOT A BOND FILM."
4,A great introduction to the Psychology of religion,This is a watershed book by a great teacher and psychologist. See also- Insight Into ValueChristopher HellstromAuthor of The March
4,A great overview of polymer clay techniques.,"I wish I had gotten this book sooner. It explains much about polymer clay that I found out through trial and error, and introduced new techniques I had never thought of. Besides the bare basics covered by most polymer clay books, the book includes chapters on millefiori, surface treatments, making and using molds, imitative techniques, vessels, floral forms, and sculpture.This book is a welcome addition to my polymer clay library and I will keep it as a handy reference."
3,Not vey instructive...,"The illustrations are good, but not very helpful as far as step by step instructions. The illustrations are somewhat helpful, but still missing instructions on how to achieve those results/designs. I will probably keep this book, however, I have to find maybe one or two more books, to assist this one in helping me to better understand working with polymer clay."
5,A great book for inspiration and creative techniques,"If you're looking for the perfect book with clear instructions on how to complete that special project tonight, this is it! Ms. Kato shares her extensive knowledge of materials and technique in a informative and instructional way that challenges the reader to reach for the clay and create. The pictures are clear and the text concise; technical information is presented in an interesting manner, as are the critiques on the particular qualities of each clay brand. Selecting the perfect clay for a unique project is easy, and the projects included are challenging and fun to execute. This book is a winner..."
3,Don't buy this one -- Donna Kato has a better one than this one,"While this book covers a variety of Polymer Clay techniques and is a good start for a beginner, I would recommend Donna Kato's book, ""The Art of Polymer Clay: Millefiori Techniques"" over this one.This book shows different techniques and has some good projects but doesn't go in the depth the other book goes into.I would buy this book to supplement the other books by Donna Kato and other Polymer Clay Artists."
2,Disappointing.,"Kato's artwork is great, but I didn't learn anything new from this book, and I read it as a beginner. Nearly all of the techniques were things I'd either figured out on my own, or read on the Internet or in the 1 other polymer clay book for beginners that I'd picked up (which honestly wasn't even very good!).Skip this one. There are much better books out there, with many more techniques to learn and enjoy."
2,Not very informative book!,This book does not give any how to! It is little info from here and there.Not a complete project for reader to follow up.Over all I was disappointed.
5,Amazing what you can do with Clay and Donna Kato,"This book goes beyond the basics of polymer clay. If you like to create your own jewelry or decorative items, Kato's book is chock-full of useful techniques. I made malachite for a book cover that was just fantastic. And it will get you interested in really wonderful techniques like Moku-gane, where you layer clay with metallic leaf and shave it for a wood-grain moire effect that is really stunning. There is instruction for faux gemstone materials. The bone and coral are especially realistic. Even the turquoise came out remarkably well.The section on making canes and reducing them is very helpful if you like to make millefiori. All in all, this is a very good book to have if you love polymer clay crafts."
5,I'm so glad I bought this book !!!!,"This is a well written, easy to understand book. There are alot of fabulous creations with pretty good instructions. The pictures are great, the instructions are clear and the text is easy to follow. Great find."
2,The poster child for 80's sound (Yuck),"Holy Smokes does this emulate the 80's sound!Drastic over production, cheesy harmonizing and keyboards that sound like body functions rather than something musical.""Naughty, naughty"" makes me wants to don my mullet wig and ""members only"" jacket and bounce around the house. The rest is too schmatzy.That ""St. Elmos Fire"" sound...BAAAARRRRRRRFFFFFF!"
5,"excellent, different, style","I am always looking for poetry books that are on one hand, comprehendible and coherent and on the other, new. This book takes a fresh and distinctive look at life today with a voice that describes visually and sensitively, the world we live in. It's artistic and strong, complex with enough simplicity in the structure that it remains intact. I would definitely recommend it for those who are tired of all the re-printed poetry of old, and the new poetry that regurgitates it. A must read."
1,Bland,The majority of these poems can be read in pre-teen diaries. The metaphors are all clichés and have been used so many times before. There's nothing new here.Save your money and get a book from a real poet.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I bought about three sets of these along with the base set to use on three floorboard heaters we have. These things are so cheap that they could not even stand up to the heat of the baseboard heater thereby negating the entire reason behind their intented use. Then you try and return them and just end up getting grief.
5,Excellent for newly divorced or separated advice,"I first heard the author in a weekend divorce seminar on which the book is based. I liked the book so much I used to keep a case of them to give away to people I met who were going through recent divorce or separation. EVERYONE that I know of who has read it has found something in it that they felt was written JUST for them it hits so close to home. Christian based, but doesn't beat you over the head with the Bible. Practical advice that covers almost everything that you will go through in the divorce process (no legal advice though)."
5,I lost 20 pounds in 5 weeks!,"I am a 37, white male. I went to the doctors a few months ago because I had problems with my energy. I felt hungry before lunch and felt like I was going to fall asleep at my desk after lunch. My doctor said that I was 35 pounds overweight, my blood pressure was high and that my cholesterol was 250. He said that I had to improve these numbers or risk heart disease later in life. This book was amazing. Within one week I felt I had much more energy. I dropped 20 pounds in 5 weeks and have not felt like I was starving. My wife lost around 9 pounds in the same time frame. You will spend more time prepairing meals and spend more $$ at the grocery store each month, but it is worth it!"
5,"Thank You, Dr. McDougal","Too bad he's married. He could cook at my house anytime!! I am not saying that just because he is good looking (although he is), but because I sometimes don't feel like cooking. However, on the serious side, I think his diet is great and by doing it and giving up gluten, I feel better. I also cannot do soy and find that there are a lot of better beans out there. (I've heard that 97% of soy in this country is GM soy, so I don't trust any products made with it). On an interesting note though, since gluten is a protein, I'm wondering if the incidence of celiac disease is arising out of us getting too much protein - just a thought. Anyway, thank you, Dr. McDougal."
1,Gained weight and fat,"I'm already vegan, and contrary to popular belief we're not all skinny! I've struggled with my weight for 30+ years since childhood, and ""eat less, burn more"" does not work for me. This was one in a long stream of diets I've tried, and I had high hopes for it as it seems simple and easy to follow. Sadly, after 5 weeks I gave up. I had gained 1 pound and more importantly gone up 1% in bodyfat percentage. I did not feel good, was hungry all the time, my blood sugar was way out of whack (I'm hypoglycemic) and I was spending huge amounts of time eating. So, not for me but give it a try. I have an ridiculously fast metabolism and I burn these foods too quickly. Someone with a slower or even average metabolism might do fine."
3,"Helpful, knowledgable, but did not like the tone.","From a health perspective, McDougall is not crazy and his program delineates a basic healthy, vegan eating style that can and does reverse heart disease and provides weight loss as a side benefit when followed correctly. The book contains a basic plan and a few recipes, follows one couple's case history as it teaches you how to adopt the lifestyle, and can be a good reference book.From a reader-enjoyment perspective, I did not like the tone of the book. A little too windy and a little too wordy and anecdotal. His other book, _The McDougall Program for Maximum Weight Loss_ is much better written as a reference type book.The ""12 Days"", while a good program and book to have, would not be my first pick. I'd go with the MWL book first."
2,Not what I thought,"This was suggested to us by a friend and we found it cumbersome. We are an active family and really do not have a ton of time for what this book requires. I'm sure it is a great book; however we were looking for more of a recipe type book and this was more about the ""why"" of eating plant-based and not so much a helpful recipe book.[...]"
4,Interesting if you want to go vegan,This book claims that you are healthier if you go vegan. Great tool if you decide to do so. It has interesting information.
3,Blame the producer!,"There are some very good songs on this album, notably Eye To Eye, This Is My Night, I Feel For You and Through The Fire. The rest is rather mediocre. Unfortunately, the producer did a lot of harm by excessive use of drum machines and sound effects which makes many of the songs sound polished and lifeless. This is particularly annoying on This Is My Night (Chaka is barely audible on that one). But this was 1984! What about remixing this album, using REAL drums and omitting the gadgets?Chaka:*****, Producer:*"
4,"Quality, Convincing Freddy Sweater","PROS:Quality replica detailed with holes, slashes, tears, and burns throughout.It is an actual sweater. (Expect to get hot if wearing in a crowded or active environment.)Fun and convincing costume piece.CONS:A bit expensive. May be worth buying a similar sweater and creating your own details."
1,"Love ""The Book"". Hate not getting all the updates.","I bought ""The Book"" so I could keep track of what I have, the cost of each item, along with all the other info. Need supplements for new beanies! Was going to buy Teenie Beanies supplement, but why bother if I cannot get the others also."
4,I loved this book! It's great!,"I, unfortunatly, am having a hard time to find update pages for my book! I can't find them ANYWHERE!!!"
5,I loved The Book!But when will we see a current update?,"I invested alot of money in all your books and supplements, but us Beanie Collectors need to know when you will have supplements so we can bring our books up to date??"
2,Doesn't anyone proofread any more?,"This has to rank as one of the most non-fictional historical fiction books I have ever read. The author can't make up his mind whether to write fiction or non-fiction. Apart from that, my main problem with the book is the lack of proof-reading: words are misspelled, left out or superfluous and/or repetitive words left in. Perhaps the worst gaffe was a reference to Jerome and a friend enjoying the aroma of tomatoes, onions and peppers cooking. Folks, Europe didn't know about tomatoes and peppers until after 1492, a millennium after Jerome lived!"
4,WaterPik TJR-3,I am a long-time waterpik user and find this a worthy replacement to its predecessor. The noise is about equal to the earlier waterpik models. This one has been trouble-free for about three months so far. It is a good instrument for its purpose.
5,water pik replacement tips,I like all the tips in this package .The one I use the least is the tongue cleaner . It is messy and I brush my tongue any way. They pop in the water jet and you are ready to use.
3,frustrating finding repalcement brushes.,"I have found that this brushes cleans my teeth very well and leaves my mouth feeling great. Unfortunaely in this part of Florida the replacement brushes are not available at any of the chain stores that they mention, leaving me with only the option to buy them online, more than doubling the cost per brush due to shipping and handling. My advice make sure that the replacement brushes are available in your area or be willing to pay the extra money to have them shipped to you."
1,Don't Buy for the Toothbrush,"The toothbrush is only a slight step above hand brushing. In fact, you really need to combine the handbrushing action with the vibrating motion to get a decent clean. I agree with the reviewer who indicates that too much of the vibration goes to your hand. I purchased this toothbrush because I had an older Waterpik brush that was not 'sonic' but did an excellent job of cleaning my teeth. This one is a failure. Buy a Sonicare if clean teeth is your goal. The tongue scraper and the rubber caps do good jobs - but - I can clean my own tongue. And with a Sonicare, I don't need the rubber cap cleaner. This has become my at work toothbrush."
3,Don't try to compare it to Sonicare,"This product is not a sonic toothbrush, it should be more appropriately called a hand vibrator. The sonic energy is not channeled to the toothbrush like the Sonicare; you get 90% of the energy in the handle, where you are holding. After the 2 min cycle is done, my hand is very relaxed, but my teeth are not that clean :( But it does come with more accessories than Sonicare, but as far as its cleaning ability, it doesn't compare. It's like comparing a Hyundai to a Mercedes."
4,"An Incisive, Positive, Constructive Book","This is a concise, intelligent piece of work written in three clearly defined segments; the most intensive being the first part which deals directly with the art of writing in the real world. There is then a short, centrally located segment which is about networking that makes plain good sense look quite simply like a brilliant idea. The Third and last section deals in no uncertain terms with the Business of Publishing, and make no mistake, the guy who wrote it has more than 40 years experience in the field, so each page he presents to us is not only useful, it's a no fooling around, fact-filled leaf within a series of only hundred and some business oriented pages that complete this valuable text. The book then is punctuated with an ending comprised of short, comprehensively helpful lists. Do yourself a favor and don't miss it."
5,"Books can't really do that, can they?","This is what happens when Strunk & White takes An Idiot's Guide to Getting Published to a cheesy motel room for a weekend of frolic. You get the perfect love child of how to write a book for publication without looking like the proverbial idiot. Seidman manages to beat the unsuspecting reader over the head with his well worn copy of Elements of Style in such a way that you don't really notice the lumps until later. Then he switches hats and lets you know exactly what's going on behind those closed editorial doors. Apparently they aren't designing new and inventive ways of make authors pull the rest of the hair out and swear to take up horticulture.If you want to write a book and you want to publish it, then this is one of those that should grace your collection of how to write books and get published tomes. It's compact, it's laminated cover doubles as a coaster in a pinch, and you can actually learn some punctuation rules if you're not careful."
3,For followers of Michael Seidman only,"I have read several manuals on writing fiction. Seidman's is strongest on instructing the aspiring novelist on the working methods of the publishing industry. However, he seems to like jazzy and highly stylized fiction much more than any other type. If you don't want to write this kind of fiction, his instruction on topics like description, point of view, and structure are of little real help. Yes, he does include the basic rules in each topic (i.e., make your description pungent, don't shift point-of-view in a clumsy fashion), but everyone who writes a book about fiction writing includes these same rules and they all say the same thing. My advice is to buy this book only if you want to write the kind of fiction that Seidman likes. If you don't, then think about buying one of the other manuals on the market that teach you how to write the kind of fiction you want to write."
2,"Not well developed, annoying","The author has taken an interesting concept and muddied it with characters that are poorly developed and so stereotypical that they are annoying. The plot goes down paths that are improbable at best. For his next effort I would recommend he seek subject matter experts to help with plot development and give him a reality check. The storyline is based on everyone who lives in rural areas being a simplistic moron, local law enforcement being glutenous dullards, military personnel are aggressive feudalistic lords and the supposedly experienced heroes bumble between courses of action that no reasonable individual would undertake. I stopped reading half way through."
1,NOT a regulator!,Item was advertized as a regulator. In actuality it is nothing more than a valve with a gage attached.
5,"Great Book , I loved it :)","I loved this book , it was hard to put down , she has some great stories to tell in her amazing life , she is one of the few REAL light workers I have met in Sedona , and she has helped me with healing work and messages , as well as many other things ,she gives more then anyone I have known in my life , always willing to help all of us lost souls ending up at her doorstep , may God bless you always MMR ."
5,"Just like this book,, short and sweet","Short but sweet. This rating is annoying because I don;t have 17 words to say,, it's very simple. I can say it in a few words"
5,The original expose of war.,"This short but powerful book exposes the lie behind the U.S. empirial wars. It is such required reading for any thinking person that I have bought several copies over the years, as gifts for friends."
5,A Warrior Kicks Warlover Butts and Names Names,"This anti-war book, written by the only American warrior ever to win the Medal of Honor twice, should be required reading for every high school senior and/or freshman in college."
5,War Is A Racket:the profit motive behind warfare,"U.S. Marine Brigadier General Smedley Butler, the most decorated military man in history, saw first-hand the lies and deceits that characterize modern warfare. He blew the whistle on the corruption and waste of lives of World War I, traveling nationally to spread the word. He warned American citizens time and again that they were being duped by the power brokers that run the American economy and that America's sons were being sacrificed for the profit motive. He offered a solution in the form of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would prevent the U.S. from making war outside our national borders.This is a powerful book all the more so in that it's power rings as true today as it did when published in 1935."
4,Very Pleased,We are very pleased with the service and the product the vendor provided. We received this item quickly and found it to be exactly as described. We recommend this vendor.
2,Short but sweet,I had no idea that the book was actually a phamphlet and was so short. I am sure more could have been written about the general. But it was short and sweet. So few words for a great general.
3,Plot to Seize,"If you are interseted in Smedly Butler, don't miss the book The Plot to Seize the White House by Jules Archer."
3,Not what I had hoped,"Often, when I read about a new subject, I like to be welcomed by a balanced, thoughtful, intelligent point of view, one that I find really convincing. This was not that point of view. He seems very opinionated, but light on the factual evidence. I had hoped to hear detailed accounts of the corporations involved in his global exploits. He just mentions them however, and then goes off on his rant including such outlandish suggestions as having our ships stay within 50 (or 100, I forget) miles of shore. While I suppose it is interesting to note that the ""military-industrial complex"" was alive and well back in the day, this is mostly just a novelty piece that offers little that can be of relevance in today's world. Overall, worth reading, but nothing to write home about. If Janine Garofalo thinks of this book as a valuable and scathing expose about war and money, She must not need much evidence to form the basis of a belief."
4,Size surprising [tiny],"This was the general who evoked the making of movie Nine Days in May thriller, a real Patriot, who like me totally distrusts Frankenstein corporations conspiratorial aims!"
4,Must Reading,"This book changed my thinking on military indoctrination in the USA,never again will I see war as it is manipulated for the masses"
5,Should be read by a Americans,"Had the recommendations of this book been carried out, we would not have our troops, equipment and cost spread all over the world fighting other countries wars. And no profiteering draining our wealth from the masses to the few."
1,Don't buy the paperback,"Don't buy the paperback with the Uncle Sam figure on the over. At 28 pages, it's either a pamphlet reprint or it is edited down. It is a very superficial treatment of the subject - a disappointment. I was visiting Butler's house last week, spoke with relatives, and I went looking for his book, prepared to be impressed. I am hoping that he has more substance than what is in this 28 page pamphlet. It is a screed against capitalism, but the Army that bought the millions of dollars worth of equipment that he points out as unnecessary, or leftover, or out of date, gets a free pass. He blames the sellers, but does not inquire about the buyers. The famous quote about being the ""gangster for capitalism"" is not in the book. It is from a speech he gave on the same subject. Perhaps this is his whole book - if so, it is freely available online. Don't waste the shipping charge for these 28 pages."
3,The reason for war is money,"I have great respect for General Butler and he is a true American patroit. Reading the book was revealing to teh corruption of war, although I was expecting the book to reveal the conspiracy of Empire to overthrough the government in the 1930;s."
5,ANTI-WAR BIBLE,"A must have, belongs to the library of any thinking citizen. It will inspire, and prove to be of value similar to works of Plato, Russeau, Voltaire, and Beech Stowe. There is not a single word of lie to it."
4,"War is a Racket, General Smedley Butler","This is an interesting book that was initially written in 1936 by a Marine know as ""The Fighting Quaker"". It's still relevant today.I learned of this through a Peace and Justice seminar given by a local college. The speakers were two IRAQ veterans who were essentially anti-war protesters. I was impressed with their passion."
1,WAR IS A RACKET,"this item was more like a phamphlet than a book.unfortunately, i thought i was purchasing a book. had i known it was only 26 large type pages i would not have purchased this item.WAR IS A RACKET reads like a short documentary."
1,This is the shortened version,"I gave this 1 star NOT because this book is horrible. In fact, it deserves 5 stars! This version with the Evil Uncle Sam on the cover is such a short version (hence the price) that you loose virtually all the famous quotes. This version states 28 pages yet the first words start on page 7. The Green Olive Leaf paperback has 80 of the original writtings. I got what I paid for :.("
5,War is a racket,"A spot on review of war by a 'been there, done that' marine. Warfare is good for the state but bad for everyone else."
5,Great read! History we should have learned from.,"Personal history of USMC General, Smedley Butler and US military intervention in countries on behalf of corporations.Relevant today, as we see history repeating itself!"
3,Slightly disappointed,"The book is edited by Dragan Nikolic and I wonder if it is true to the original writing of General Butler.However, that being said, I greatly enjoyed the insight of war by General Butler's view."
1,Bleck!!,This stuff taste awful!! I know this product isn't valued for taste but I couldn't even use it for its medicinal purposes because the taste was so... ughh... pungent. i put one drop in a full glass of tea and all you could taste was the penny royal. i used it once and never again! so if anyone wants a bottle of pennyroyal just mail me a stamped envelope and i'll give the thing to you lol! its just that awful!
2,Looks Nice- Poor Quality Drawer Construction,"This product looks nice, and functions well- However, the drawers were bent and didn't go together well. Took much work to get them to go together correctly and to appear straight when closed. I ordered two of these cabinets and both had problems."
1,Terrible,"This is the biggest piece of crap I've ever spent money on. The drawers are crooked, I have to wrestle with them to pull them open and push them closed, and they make a terrible squealing sound the whole time. Oh, and the drawers are too wide so hanging files don't actually ""hang"" in them, which, you know, is kind of the whole point. But I'm stuck with this piece of crap because now it's fully assembled, the box has been recycled and there's no way I'm interested in disassembling it at this point to send it back. Huge waste of time and money."
5,Delicious Parmesan Cheese,you cant tell it's vegan..but you can because it taste way better than cow or goat cheese..you wont be disappointed!!!!
1,How is this vegan?,Galaxy nut'l foods needs to look up the definition of VEGAN - the VERY 1st ingredient is casein--comes from cow's milk/HELLO
1,Not Vegan..,This product is not a vegan product. Vegan would not consist of casein which I do not understand how they can label it such especially with people with allergies..
1,Complete ripoff,"In a lapse of my usual careful attention I failed to notice that this costs $4.62 with a grayed out shipping cost of $12.95 that's harder to spot. I was just paying attention to my cart total to reach the Super Saver shipping amount, failed to realize the shipping amount is part of the item cost in the cart. Really? $12.95 to ship a few ounces. I won't be ordering from this company again and will be much more careful about ordering from Amazon. I should have read the reviews more carefully because my vegan daughter will refuse to eat this."
5,Great music.............should be much more well known,"First came across the spectacular tune 'Go Get On It' in Blade. All of the music in this album follows the same formula on that tune, but in a good way. Lots of beefy funk and originslity. Great music to have on while your working or walking. Hard to not like."
2,"very dated, bad video quality even on DVD","You are glad when this one is over.Most of the footage seems to have been shot in the middle 1990s (or earlier), and shot badly. There is lots of jitter in the image, and low res footage. Although Dr. Merry's wife supposedly speaks Japanese, she can't get her husband to correctly pronounce many Japanese words - like names of major cities. As other reviewers have pointed out, she appears randomly in scenes, and one wishes she wouldn't.This is a very superficial view of Japan, some of the topics of greatest length are sumo, feeding the deer in Nara park, and the Ainu in Hokkaido who perform for tourists. The films contains many small errors about Japan - for example its not hard or rare to go visit a sumo training stable - some of the stables are open daily.One gets the impression that this film was stitched together from free film the collected from JAL and other travel agencies in Japan - some of it might be from the 70s"
4,Aesthetic glassware set,"These are attractive glassware, and they feel good in the hand. They seem fairly durable and after a week of use they haven't shown any signs of being susceptible to breakage. The tall glasses are slim enough to be comfortable to hold, yet wide enough that you can wash them by hand easily. The short glasses are just the right size, both short, wide and squat. Both look pleasing to the eye and, with their beveled sculpting, can easily be a part of a formal dinner setting. The only negative I would list would be that the price could be lower, as you can find competing sets at discounters like Walmart for less. However, this is still a very reasonable purchase."
4,Not as bad as some may say ...,"Yes I am ordering another set because several have broken over the years. It's the tall glass that breaks, I haven't lost a small one yet. Yes, you drop it and it will probably break. They do not just break in a dishwasher during a wash however. If they are not put in the dishwasher straight and they tip over while moving a drawer in and out quickly and hit another whatever that is hard, it will probably break ... its glass; glass breaks.However I am ordering another set because I like the size. I can make a mixed drink with ice and use a whole 16oz can of soda to top it off. I also really like the shape which makes drinking much more pleasurable than a glass that flares out.If you're ruff with your dishes, get something else. If you are somewhat careful with your dishes, you will like these. I just wish they came as a tall set or a short set ... I really don't have much use for the short glasses."
4,"pretty, if slightly thin","I like the simple elegance of these glasses. I've had them for about 3 months now, and no breakages. The tall ones are a little thin at the top. After reading the reviews, I haven't taken any chances and only hand wash them. But definitely the short glasses fare well in the dishwasher. All in all, they were exactly what I was looking for in price and quality."
3,Broken glass,1 of my 16oz glasses was cracked from bottom going halfway up the glass. Disappointed that I am starting off my set with 1 short. Too much trouble to pack them all up and send them back.
3,Beautiful But Fragile,"I had this set right after getting married - it has since been replaced. The glasses, while gorgeous, are very fragile and thin. In addition, at the time we didn't have a dishwasher, and these glasses are difficult to completely clean without a dishwasher due to the small detail pieces around the bottom.Over all, I loved the looks of these glasses, but for everyday usage they weren't practical at all. Three stars, because they are beautiful even if fragile."
2,not up to par,"We picked these out for our wedding registry and have been disappointed. They have a nice grip, but they break very easily. Do not put them in the dishwahser unless you want to spend the next day sorting through broken glass. I would not suggest that anyone purchase these, especially if they have children."
2,Poor Quality Control,"These glasses arrived unbalanced, with lopsided bases and uneven rims. These would be called seconds or thirds by most standards. I don't know what happened in quality control since earlier reviews, but these should be avoided. The glasses are cheap in construction, quality, and have thin glass."
2,Depends who is buying these and how they are using them.,These are a bit too fragile for those who rush around in the kitchen or have teens. I bought these for my son to set up his first kitchen. He says the bottom of the glass is not smoothly flat so doesn't set well. He has broken a few.
3,break easily,"Got these from our wedding registry and have used them for about the past 6 months since we moved into our house. 2 of the tall ones have broken as well as one of the short ones while my husband was washing dishes. Was going to replace them with the same style, but since breaking seems to be a problem with these per other reviews, I think I'll try another style. Too bad - I love the looks of them!"
5,Hats Off for This Hudson Guide,"I love the Hudson Valley--from West Point's bastion of training young military leadership to Hyde Park's memorial to Franklin D. and Eleanor Roosevelt to Poughkeepsie's CIA--that's the Culinary Institute of America, famous for scrumptious dinners. Ms. Kanter obviously loves the Valley, too, for it shows in her excellent research and writing. I highly recommend it for anyone who yearns to visit this lovely part of upstate New York. Wake up, Rip Van Winkle!"
5,This book is for Objectivists,"I read this book on the recommendation of Dr. Harry Binswanger from the Ayn Rand Institute after attending his lecture on how people can achieve certainty epistemologically (i.e., how to learn and how to be sure that what you learn is real and correct) by first relying on sensory information.While the subject matter of the book is animals, it makes the case that animals reliably acquire information about their environment through their senses. And since humans are animals too, it follows that humans can place high reliability on the information provided to them by their senses (especially sight).This scientific research provides a good antidote against those who argue that sensory information is inherently unreliable because our sensory organs are either deficient or incapable of adequately gathering information about reality."
1,Bad DVD transer>>>>,"Unfortunately, I received a bad DVD transfer. The dubbing was off. If you order this version, check your DVD! I was disappointed, but Amazon came through for me. I received my money back and the return was pretty easy.I rated this a one star btw because the field would not let me leave it blank.Thanks again Amazon for making this process easy."
2,"Does the job, but not that well","The unit consistently delivers the same temperature, which is good, but that temperature is always about five degrees higher that where I set it. So if I want my tank at 77 I need to set this to 72. These products are all about accuracy and consistency, and this unit has not been so great. I'm too lazy to make a warranty claim, but I figured other customers should know my experience."
2,Not That Great,"I got this heater with a fish tank that we purchased. It was keeping our 65 gal tank about 80, but when I saw where the dial was set, I moved it to 82, and it made my tank go to 90 degrees! I was shocked when I saw the temp. I had to do some fancy footwork to get the tank down to where it should be. I will be buying a new heater. Accuracy is important. I would not recommend this heater."
2,save your money,"a big disappointment from Hydor. I like this heater because you can easily adjust the thermastat (turn dial located on top of the heater shaft) and also bc it has a light to indicate when it is on, however, the thermastat on this heater is completely WRONG. i have my chiller set to 78* (76*-80* range). when my chiller kicks on at 80*, i can look and my heater is also turned on even though the heater thermastat is set all the way down to 71*. My chiller was constantly turning off and on (annoying!!) and as soon as i removed this heater from my tank, it stopped. I also ran two more different thermometers just to be sure it wasnt my chiller.on a semi-positive note, I have a 28gal reef tank with a 1/15HP chiller and this little heater can rival my chiller without a problem, so it is quite powerful."
1,UPDATE: Worked fine for 14 months then failed catastrophically,"As other reviewers noted, this seems to run about 5 degrees warmer than the dial indicates. It's been in the tank about a month and hasn't broken yet.UPDATE: 14 months after purchase, the heater stuck on, shattered the glass tube, then shorted out, dumping nasty, smoking, oily guck into my tank. I lost all my fish, and the tank is a mess.It worked fine until it didn't, then it failed about as completely and dangerously as it possibly could. I've reduced my review to 1 star. I am not interested in having it repaired or replaced by Hydor. Good riddance. This heater is a hazard."
4,social history is the focus,Social history is the focus of what is touted as a general introduction to Greek history. A good supplemental text to a class but not one to use without professor additions or another text. Has been replaced by Powell and Harris & Platzner's text books on mythology.
5,Just What I Wanted,"I have been looking for something like this set for a while now. I have a plastic pitcher and I hate it!! Juice just seems to taste better out of a glass container to me. This reminds me also of my childhood. The glasses are perfect size for juice-not too big nor small. The nice thing also about it is that you can close the juice up- unlike my pitcher. The oranges add the nice touch to the decor of it. I am so glad I finally found this set- I had it in my mind what I wanted, not knowing if I could find it- and I did!!!!"
4,good value,"we purchased this heater and then when we went to put it hook it up discovered that the other heater we had, had gone out, killing our fish. we have yet to put this one in the tank, we are stil alittle sad to get new fish yet."
2,too fragile,It almost immediately broke on me. I didn't realize why at first. I was using it to make an incubator to grow yoghurt and I may have used less water than recommended. For the couple days it was intact it worked fine.
2,Unreliable,"My heater, when turned all the way down, kicks on around 79-80 degrees. It needs to go lower obviously. I plan to put it on a separate controller since the reliability is so weak. I'd advise you do the same if you purchase this."
1,Totaly inaccurate,"I bought 200W heater for my 40G tank. I set temperature at 79F, the thermometer (sticker) went out of max range (>88F). I turned the dial alway the way down to 69F, it still kept the temperature at 82F. It killed 2 fish already. The problem is that I can't lower the temperature anymore. It is not usable."
1,overheats - avoid this heater,"I have one of these that came with the aquarium. It is overheating now. I have been wracking my brain trying to figure out what's going on then I decided to come to Amazon to see if there were any negative experiences... and boy are there! I am gonna order a new one. Thanks, amazon for having useful reviews, and thanks fellow reviewers for letting me know the heater is bad. You saved my fish.The negative reviews are correct here, I am afraid. I'd never buy this heater. Caveat emptor!"
5,"THE BOOK, LIKE THE FOOD, IS AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS","Though they say don't judge a book by its cover, this book is the exception. The cover is a wonderrful work of art and so is the book itself. While some may buy the book simply for its beauty, as with crab itself, what's inside is what matters. This book is very easy and enjoyable to read, and it provides great and easy to prepare recipes. For anyone who already enjoys crab, it is a must have. And for the those haven't had the chance to develop a ""craving for crab,"" it should be required reading. I'm buying a number of copies to give as gifts."
1,"joanne, ""walking"" senior citizen","Thought I was going crazy!!! So happy I read reviews on Amazon site re: Sony Walkman Digital Radio, Model SRF-M35.Have had almost identical experiences as other reviewers... failure of performance, hissing, etc. I have been unsuccessful in getting ANY response from SONY after sending registered letter to Administative Offices. What happened to the great SONY company? Poor quality, poor service etc. Even retailers are reluctant to refund/exchange this item."
4,Not Nearly As Bad As Previous Review,"This unit provides average to above average reception. Once you get accustomed to the layout of the control buttons, memory buttons, etc., it's fine. It does have a ""lock"" button to prevent it from being inadvertently powered on. It's so lightweight (two AAA batteries that last a long time) as to be almomst unnoticeable on my hip. I'm looking for a second one so I can give my wife back tis one!"
4,nice little radio to work out with,"i wanted something light, small, and easy to deal with at the gym while i work out. this product turns out to be near perfect. its very lightweight and has a belt clip that i can attach onto my shorts. i would have hoped that the headphones were the more 'sport' type, but they are the bigger, old-fashioned headphone. there is no arm band, but i prefer the belt clip to an arm band when i work out. overall, i would recommend this am/fm radio walkman because of its size, versatility, and good price."
1,poor quality,"After about 5 months of use this unit failed. It began to ""drift"" and could not hold a station.Also it would not change stations after a while. Buyer beware this is a bad unit. Not that i am suprised because most sony products have a limited life span but 5 months is weak."
3,"Pretty good performance, but not astounding","For the price of this one digital radio, I could have purchased a tape player with a digital radio included, and not too much larger! For being just a radio, I would expect this to be a little smaller and cheaper.I wanted to get a radio that could pull in a couple of distant stations while playing frisbee golf. I wanted digital tuning and the absolutely best reception that I could get.I was a little disappointed. The weaker stations were sometimes drowned out by a powerful station at the other end of the dial (problem with image rejection). It also does not have a ""seek"" feature. Expect to spend a lot of time scanning the dial manually unless you already know the stations that you want to listen to. Otherwise, it is a fine radio. It sounds good, and if you listen to stations that have a fairly strong signal, then you should be happy with this."
1,Revised Opinion,On Oct 1st I wrote a gushing review which I'd like to rescind!!! The build quality on this radio is atrocious!!! Since my original review I'm now on radio number three. Number 1 seemed to get hissy after a while. Number 2 sounded great and was pulling in weaker stations better than #1 and then the volume on all FM stations went to 50%!! The third one I've just exchanged seems to be not as sensitive and my Sangean DT110 is doing a slightly better job of pulling in the weak stations. As others have said - keep your receipt!!!
2,Broke within a month,"Loved the radio, but the poor construction was a real problem. The first time I changed the batteries the internal circuit boar broke. I was able to solder the connections back together, but it was never quite the same and no longer reliable. Next time I'll get a sturdier model."
3,not really ESL,"Intrigued by the title, I purchased this to use in teaching English as a second language. It contains great ideas for teaching children and encouraging talk but is not what I wanted as a teacher of adult beginners."
1,For Teens?,"I confess I did not finish reading this book, but I did not like what I read. The author appeared to be making fun of older monks and seemed childishly immature. Two reasons I did not finish the book: (1) I didn't like the book. (2) I lost the book, but I would not have finished reading the book even if I had not lost it."
4,"Inspired Me To Write, Too!","The peek into his monastic life inspired me to write about mine. The cloister has always been a magnet for the odd, the eccentric, and the brilliant. Rougeau painted his brothers well."
3,Too Much Information,"Although interesting, ""All We Know of Heaven,"" is a bit more than I'd like to know. The main character's battle with his homosexuality is a valid subject for a community of cloistered men. However, the detail in which this struggle is described and the character's attempt to rectify the situation made me uncomfortable enough to contemplate discontinuing any further reading of the book.The casual reader looking for a source of entertainment may find this book boring. The story has no conventional line, i.e. introduction - tension and relief. It's the simple story of a young man who joins a Catholic monastery and his experiences over the years. Each chapter is essentially a new story as opposed to a traditional line that has chapters connected to each other like train cars.If you have any interest in monastic life you will probably enjoy ""All We Know of Heaven."" (As long as you skip chapter 4, that is.)"
3,"This ""Monk"" is spotty at best.","DeWilde is French, so the translation may have failed him, but the writing is rather scattershot and too dependent on ""hipster"" conversational asides. Biographical information is presented out of sequence and often without context. Where this book shines is in DeWilde's explications of Monk as a composer and technician. Those interested in a full-blown biography of Monk will probably have to wait until Peter Keepnews forthcoming book appears."
3,"Tip's fine, problem is the fit","when i bought this, i didnt realise it wouldnt fit on all canes. My first cane was the long fiberglass one from NFB, which has the flat metal tip. with the broken sidewalks and areas with no sidewalks at all, a flat tip was a nightmare for me. so i thought i would get a rolling one....not realising there isnt any way to adapt this kind to the NFB freebie cane. so, when ordering, make *really* sure you can put this or any other tip on your existing cane, or you will be like me, stuck with a perfectly good tip, that is useless to you..."
4,A leisurely fantasy on daughter-awakening,"Very much a moderato-cantabile paced book, but rich enough to keep this impatient male reader to the end. (If I were editing I would have cut down on the local color just a bit.) However, the themes of the book are very much more related to female readers; there are travails which men do not need to understand completely. The use of magic is very nice - magic in this universe is not simple or effortless!"
1,"great premise, slooooow execution.","I tried very hard to like this book, but I simply didn't like the author's plodding writing style. She spells everything out - and I mean everything - and it takes her five paragraphs to say what could be said in one sentence. She makes everything, including magic, sound dull and boring. I ended up skimming most of the book because I did want to find out how the book ended, but it was slow torture getting there."
4,Excellent new work by Ms. Lindskold..,"I began reading the ""Firekeeper"" books and when I learned that this book would be coming out, I knew I'd have to read it.It is an imaginative and engaging tale of ""Mira"", her past, her present, and a house that seems more to own its family than the reverse.There are a couple of dry spots in this book and nearing the end, we have to take a few leaps of faith with Mira, as some things that should've been more descriptive were not. The storyline just leaps forward without the main character truly having quite all the information she'd need to make a critical realization.We aren't left so much with more questions as we are with an incomplete understanding and a lingering supposition that there may be another book or at least more to the story.Still a trailblazing novel and excellent work of art. Kept the pages turning, engaging characters, emotion and mystery.Summing up, the book is a new recommended read, even with the minor flaws it contains.Thanks Ms. Lindskold!"
5,"Outstanding ""Who dunnit?"" and a ""tear jerker""","This movie is an ultimate ""tear jerker"" and a great ""who done it?"" to boot. It is one of Morgan Freeman's earliest movies. He and John Lithgow were great in it. But they both played second ""fiddle"" to the awesome depth and poise displayed by the dead Black Vietnam hero soldier's mother (C.C.H. Pounder), as far as I'm concerned. This is now one of my all time favorite movies. /s/ Steve @ BibleProbe.com"
2,Resting Place,"The movie was slow moving and tedious. Fell asleep several times during the movie. As a matter of face, watched it with a couple friends and we all fell asleep at one point or another. Wouldn't recommend it"
4,Compassionate and caring.,"Great story line, showing how little we have progressed as human beings when it comes to prejudice."
2,Looks good but,I still did not receive the product after one month of the order. Don't know what's happen.
1,fetted dingos kidneys,...grunting accompanied by an early 80's video game sound track is NOT electronica.only tracks 3 & 6 can (in my not exactly humble opinion) be defined as electronica. i am growing very tired of having some hack (i.e. mtv) throw together a bunch of rap remixes and call it cutting edge. track 9 is good only i comparison to the previous two tracks of unmitigated beef tripe. track 10 was beautiful. but misplaced on this album.both propellerheads and fat boy slim are now diminished in my eyes for consenting to be a part of this act of artistic flatulence.i miss the good ole days when mtv actually focused on the music rather than trying (and failing) to define pop culture.j=and thats how i feel
2,A poor followup to the orignal AMP--not the same effect.,"For all those who loved the first AMP album, you will be greatly disappointed. There are only two good songs on this album: The Rockafeller Skank, and Brown Paper Bag. Otherwise, the entire CD blows. Nowadays, The Rockafeller Skank is on a number of other compilation CD's as well as the Fatboy Slim album, so don't worry not finding this elsewhere. I don't know what MTV was thinking when they decided to put their name on this CD. Were they thinking that electronica fans are just sheep and will listen to anything they put on the followup of Amp1 (which is an outstanding group of unique works)? Save your money on this one. I'm sorry for all those who bought it and don't know what to do with it now. I sure don't know."
2,A poor follow-up,"AMP was a fairly good intro to electronic music for those not in the know. This CD...I don't know what this CD's for. There are two very good tracks here - the first and the last (well, not counting that last ""hidden"" track, whatever it is). In between are overlong beats and (occasional) raps with not much to recommend either. Pass on this one."
1,"blah, blah","After hearing Fatboy Slim's ""The Rockafeller Skank"" I was really looking forward to what else would be on Amp 2 and I was disappointed, beyond that, as a huge fan of techno and electronica, i wasn't into the remastered muck and hip hop."
2,Quite a disappointment. save your money.,"Unfortunately, Fatboy Slim and Goldie are not surrounded by their equals. This cd is just as boring as amp 1, although the cover art is nice. The attempt to mix old school rythms with electronica is quite depressing. Other than track 1 and 8, this album should be listed in the easy listening section. Astraswerks...please redeem yourself."
1,100% garbage,"if you're buying electronica, you deserve low-rate garbage like this. there's so much more available in the world of digital, dance, experymental, and u-ground music. get educated, muster some self-respect, and steer clear of this mtv/chemically/electronic junk."
4,wow... piku live,first of this one is about ten times better than amp 1... its mix of hip-hop and electronic is amazing... but the tracks aren't consistant... though most of the songs are good some are just average... really i would only give it three stars but to hear piku by the chemical brothers live (track 13) was just to cool... so i had to give it four... other than that the best tracks are battleflag (by the wonderful lo fi allstars) and jungle brother... it wont be the hit of your collection... but its worth buying...
1,"This CD sucks, FatBoy Slim should be dissapointed.","After hearing Rockafeller Skank by Fatboy Slim, I purchased this CD because I thought it was going to be filled with rave techno and such...Well it's not, it's composed mostly from Rap-remixes which really made me say ""Dammit! This CD sucks, I want my money back!!!"" Not only is this CD loaded with talenteless compilations, MTV has the nerve to edit original lyrics out of many songs!!! (which makes them even less original) Even though I dislike these songs, out of respect for the artists, I do believe that a song should stay in it's original composition (hell, would you stand for a great Van Gogh or Warhol masterpiece that has black tape over ""indecent"" areas?!?!?!) Who's to say what is appropriate in music?...they sure arent, the artist is. So to sum it all up, this CD sucks, and it's probably the fault of the money-hungry sellout known as MTV, who is trying to form every type of music into one mold that we call ""Top 40""."
4,"A ""Must Read"", for serious students of military history.","Major John lock has been there and done that. Both as a United States Army Ranger and as a military historian. While the reading drys out occasionally you can refresh yourself by stepping back and putting the words on the page in the context of the time and place the men were performing their deeds. From Major Rogers and the French-Indian War to Saving Private Ryan to the two Medals of Honor awarded in Somalia, Lock covers the entire history of the United States Army Rangers."
4,A great book on what it means to be brave,"This book cover the hundreds of years that the Army Rangers or similar units have been fighting with tremendous bravery. Lock begins in the French and Indian War with Rogers' Rangers and continues all the way to the Rangers exploits in Somalia in 1993. Overall, it is a very fascinating book involving many fascinating - but unknown - heroes. Just to be a Ranger is to be a hero, and Lock shows that very well. The only complaint is he goes on for far too long on the French and Indian War. This is not all bad, though. Although that war is considered boring, he shows the incredible bravery of Rogers and his men. Despite the outdated war, bravery of men is still very modern. I would read this book again if I had the patience to read 400 pages of the same material again."
5,This is a very entusiastic Book.,If before i wanted to be a Ranger after reading this Book i want to be it even more!! With out any question this is a Book that puts you inside the realaty of being a Ranger and fighting for it's Values.It provides you with long hours of excitement. Rangers leed the Way.
3,Wait For the Price to Come Down!,"Admittedly, I am just a ""big kid"". I try to keep up on things with my kids and their new thing was the V3 Tamagotchi. So when I saw this, I was very excited. When it finally came out, we ran to the store to grab it. It's fun for about 15 mins then it becomes VERY repetitious. My hand actually got tired from using the stylus. Kids under the age of 10 will become bored after 6 customers. (As the game increases, so do the customers and their requests each take about 3 minutes. Try serving 20+ customers in a row.) :( Kids 11 and over, don't even bother.Also would be a good idea to get some kind of screen protection because ONLY the stylus is used, and it's used A LOT! I bought a package from Penguin that had screen protectors and cases for about $19, good investment.It's a cute game, but wait until it comes WAY DOWN in price. Perhaps Christmas time?"
4,i like playing the games and the shop best,i love playing the games and the shop its so much fun i think you should buy it
2,Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun,"Game this is fun. Enjoyed it I did, my tomagotchees fought they did. Kicked out of school they was. Navi! Navi! Naabee Kuriakose!This game is fun, and it was a remake of the 2991 best seller. I give this gerwtuh stars out of labnuyt."
3,Tamagotchi,This was an all right game. I wanted to get it for a friend who has the small tamagotchi keychain games. She really liked this game because it took tamagotchi to a new level.
4,"Good Value- Works great, sounds great, small & light.","I definitely recommend this MP3 player. I researched purchasing MP3 players for months before deciding to buy this one.I work out very hard, and I wanted a MP3 player that I could wear while working out, and this is it. I don't wear it around my neck though, but rather use a safety pin and pin it to my waist band of my shorts. I can run full out with out it bouncing around or getting in the way. I can lift without it getting in my way.I would have given it 5 stars, but the capacity is not quite big enough. I can fit 25 MP3 songs on it, and it is sufficient, but I would prefer more. If I could go back and do it over, I would buy the IRIVER 256."
3,Great product....IF it works,"Bought the iRiver over Christmas after doing due diligence (reading reviews, comparing products etc.) since it seemed to have the most features in its price range. An absolute value for money. Tried it out and the piece worked great....for the first hour. It died and unfortunately could not be revived even after replacing the new batteries that came with it. Couldn't figure out what happened! The memories of that first hour were mostly good; the controls took a bit of getting used to, the software interface was nice and the sound was awesome. Unfortunately, had to send it back....what good is an mp3 player that doesn't work!"
2,"good product, while it lasts","This was my first MP3 player and at first it was great. It is lightweight, great for the gym, relatively inexpensive, good battery life, w/enough memory for a couple hours worth of music. Downloading was a little cumbersome, but the interface was pretty easy to use.Unfortunately, despite excellent care (never dropped it, didn't beat it up at all), it up and died after only 9 months of use. The control buttons appear to be stuck in the depressed position and no amount of fussing or battery changing will get it to turn on or respond to commands. The warranty was only 90 or 30 days - can't recall exactly - but in either case had long since passed when the unit self-destructed."
4,"So far, So Good!","I've always wanted an MP3 player that was also an FM radio. Well when I found this iRiver model I was stoked to see that it had the FM recording capability. I've had it for a few days now and it works well. It took a while to master the controls, (still havent really figured out how to preset FM stations) but all in all its a great little gadet. The MP3/WAV sound quality is great, the software froze on me a couple of times but not to bad otherwise. FM recording doesnt have the same sound quality as the MP3 or WAV files but it's good just the same. Only issue is my ear buds. I found that the left bud's wire is shorter than the right! I'm not sure if its supposed to be like that or if mine is defective. It's annoying but the buds have a much better sound quality to them then my pricey headphones so I grin in bare it. All in all, a great gadget."
3,Not the Best & Not the Worst,The mp3 player is good except the directions are very confusing. To transfer cd's to mp3 format is very complicated and always doesn't work. I would consider looking in to an Ipod. I heard there great. A little more money though.
1,IRiver IFP-180T MP3 was great untill it died.,"WARNING!!!!!I admit, this WAS a great MP3 player. It lasted many hours on one AA battery, received FM stations well, was able to record from the radio...3 months ago, I purchased this MP3 payer at the same time a co-worker of mine did, he talked me into it. His IRIVER IFP-180T quit powering on (died) within ONE WEEK!! He took it back to BestBuy and exchanged it for a new one. We laughed and thought he got a ""lemon"". Then two day ago (almost three monts old), mine died and quit powering on, just like his did.SO.... I would recommend not buying one of these since they do not seem very reliable."
1,NOT FOR VOICE RECORDING!!!!,"I assume this product works fine for mp3 playback as the other reviewers seem to indicate. However, I bought this specifically to record my sessions (I am a therapist) and it did an absolutely terrible job. You could only hear tiny distortions and this would be from approximately 3-4 feet away. So if you are looking for something to do voice recording I recommend the RipFlash Plus. It does an excellent job at voice recording although it also has a few challenges. Please see my review there."
1,Worst MP3 player,I bought this MP3 player thinking I was getting everything in one device..FM stereo and MP3 player. I was WRONG. This player has the worst user interface of any electronic device I have purchased. The thing defaults to voice recording and the FM tuner has terrible reception. I can not pick up any stations. I want a refund...this is the WORST MP3 player I have ever owned. I would not recommend this player to anyone. Save your money...
1,I can not make it work,"I bought this thing a week ago and since then I've been trying to figure out how to record music. I tried several paid services, but all of them code their songs so I can not play the songs on my machine. It anybody told me from where and how I can record music I would appreciate it very much. akrapivin@hotmail.com"
3,Good player; awful software,"Now I read that this was to avoid bootlegging (though I don't get this logic, if it was on your computer in the first place....). However, the iriver software cannot make MP3s from your CDs! So how is one to get MP3s for this unit? Bootleg stuff! I use another software package to rip MP3s from my CDs and than use the iriver software to put it to the player. I can't say enough bad stuff about the software. However, the unit itself is great. If you have a plan as far as software is concerned, go for it."
4,Worth the money,Excellent mp3 player I haven't had any problems with it since I brought it. It was as lil tricky to figure out at first but once you get the hang of it its smooth sailing.The only complaint I have about it is that I wish it held a little bit more memory.
5,OMG!!!!,"I am a gringo, 60 years old, but this DVD is increible y ahora, me estoy enamorado de ella. Julieta is not only beautiful, but her música is just extraordinary. Everything about this concert is just perfect. I have watched it every evening for the last two weeks and am absolutemente asombrado and mesmerized. Each song is delightful, and a couple of them move me to tears (""El Presente"" y ""Lento""). Me encanta este concierto y especialmente Julieta. Ella es diosa del cielo. Even if you don't speak Spanish I think you will feel the passion of this truly gifted chiquita. This is the best DVD concert I have ever seen."
2,"Same Old, Same Old","I flipped through this at the Midnight Special in Santa Monica and alighted on the chapter on finding an agent, since I was looking for a new agent at the time (and am still looking). When the author recommends going to writer's conferences, because agents often attend them, I tossed the book back on the shelf with a snort of derision. This book presents a superficial overview of various subjects and doesn't have nearly enough concrete examples, like a full book proposal or sample query letters. This is the same old stuff I've seen in every other writing book."
4,Very informative and startling read,"Mr Collison obviously had, and still has, a remarkable insight into East Timor. The recent events in the region are testimony to this. The Australian / US involvement in those times was probably, only just, justified. However, the tardiness in the realisation that Communism was no longer a threat is disgustingly obvious and the region is paying the price for this today.My congratulations to the author for impeccable accuracy in his predictions, only the last chapter need be changed to make it almost a work of fact!!"
5,engrossing,"Collison's book, The Timor Man, is exciting, thoughtful, and fun to read. With all of the attention recently paid to East Timor, I was fascinated to read something of the historical roots of current news as well as some interesting speculation as to what sort of resolution may present itself someday. The role of the US in recent East Timorese history was an unpleasant surprise - I'd like to believe it fiction, but Collison's record of barely-fictionalized reporting suggests otherwise. Overall, an engrossing and compelling read."
2,"Show, Don't Tell!","I'll take it for granted that the author knows what he is talking about, has a deep cultural knowledge and so on. It seems that way from what I've read about him on the net. But the writing style of this book is so awful that I'll never know for myself, nor will I be able to talk about characters, plot development and so on.If I'm reading a novel I don't need to know what's going on inside the head of everyone in every scene, plus background material that apparently drops down from the ceiling. There's also something odd about sentence length and rhythms or something that just grates.Maybe the author has spent too many years writing reports. Maybe I'm just not his target audience. Maybe I'm missing something. But whatever it is, I couldn't read much more than a few pages out of this book. I'm especially sorry because it was a gift from someone I like a lot."
2,Dissapointment,"This movie was such a let down. Great cast, great story line, great cinematography, really good soundtrack, but it just missed on so many levels. The story line, men in their early 40's looking back on their life and realizing things didn't turn out as expected... This has been done before, but with this cast, and how they set it up, a week away filled with drugs and alcohol, could have been really good. Instead they spend way too much time on the drugs and alcohol and do nothing to really develop the characters. Each character has an intriguing back story, but they do very little to help you understand who they are and where they are in their lives. I felt they really missed on the dialog, I like all of these actors but felt they wasted their talents. The little bit of deep dialog there is is good, but they could have done so much more. I won't give away the twist, it was a cool twist but again executed poorly because the characters weren't developed enough."
1,I Melt With You,"Early Bret Easton Ellis novels and their subsequent film adaptations were famous for portrayals of disaffected youth doing naughty things and contemplating life. Now, imagine a handful of characters in their forties doing the same thing, and you've got I Melt With You. Rob Lowe, Jeremy Piven, Thomas Jane, and Christian McKay are old college buddies who meet up annually at Big Sur to celebrate a birthday, but with their own families and hidden secrets plaguing them, they embark on a week of drugs and parties until a tragedy forces them to face their past. Steer clear of I Melt With You, the film's laughable script and ludicrous plot points do nothing to help the actors trying so desperately to make something of the material."
2,I love Rob Lowe,Huge Rob Lowe and Jeremy Pivens fan but not in this movie. Horrible! Do not waste your time or money
4,Strange,"It is a very strange show about a group of friends who went to college together and get together every summer for a week or so to catch up and stay in touch. It was a sad show, but it was performed really well by all who were involved."
1,"Interesting, but I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time...","Great cast, but the ending made me wish I wouldn't have bothered watching it. I like most dark, twisted movies, but not this one. I nearly fell asleep in the middle of it, but then it became weird enough to hold my attention to the end. I wish I would have just turned it off, as it was a disappointment."
1,Don't Watch it!,"Terrible, terrible movie. Its a waste of 2 hours. Their secret is not really a secret but a pack. Its slow and boring. I kept watching to find out what the secret was. Music is pretty good but loud and hard to hear what the guys are saying. Don't waste your time watching a bunch of 40 year old losers do drugs and kill themselves. Pathetic movie."
1,Soooo Bad,As a 43 Yr Male (4 characters are all 44) I could not identify at all with the characters (they all acted like 12) nor could I even follow what the story was even about. Pretty depressing music and mood throughout entire film and not in a good/art/story way. More satisfaction from watching paint dry.
1,Couldn't finish this movie,"DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE! I couldn't finish this movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I guess there's a reason I'd never heard of I Melt With You. I found this movie through Amazon on my Roku. I like Thomas Jane, Rob Lowe, Jeremy Piven & Carla Gugino so I'd thought I'd give it a try. This was a waste of time and money. DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE"
3,I Melt With You,"I truly enjoy all of the actors in this movie, but it was an erie, yet prdictable ending. I like the fact that actors pursue various roles and when they can pull it off, and it's believable, they have done their jobs."
2,Dragged on,"The acting was great but the movie felt like it was dragging on. The drug use took away from character development and the plot was lacking. With such a great cast, I was expecting something better.The sound track was good though."
1,Worthless,Possibility one of the most worthless movies I have seen in a long time. What a collection of losers. To exalt this group borders on the stupid.
1,Pointless Dreck,"Worst waste of time I've ever spent in front of a movie/TV screen. If it were possible to give it a negative five-star rating, I would. The producer, writer, & director of this negative, soul-imploding, self-indulgent dreck should all be put under 24-hour psychiatric observation for creating and promulgating such intellectually and spiritually pernicious garbage. There might be a language in this universe that's sufficient to convey adequately the artistic and spiritual depths to which this film plunges, but the English Language isn't it. Watch this movie at your own risk--you've been warned."
1,I Melt With You,"This was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. While some may wonder how this film was made, I would ask ""why"" it was made. Save your money."
2,not the sound track one expects,It did not contain the ballads that were played in the background. they were hits from the 30's & 40's whicj were not part of the track.
2,Good but not safe,"This is an ok toy and keeps the little ones entertained. But, it is not at all safe. The unit is too heavy for the straps that come with it. It is not easy to attach it to stroller/car seat. It almost fell on my son a couple times. This one is going straight back."
2,Too much,If the author could get past describing every little nook and cranny of everything in the book and get on with the story I might actually finish this book-- kindle version. I guess for those who are science/technology buffs this could be fun but if you just want a good entertaining read forget it.
4,great book,This has been a fantastic series. Well worth the price. The publisher should be ashamed though. The editing errors are distracting.
4,"Good story, lousy copy editing","I'm enjoying the story, but I find the horrible copy editing to be very distracting. I've learned to quickly recognize the numerous spelling and grammar mistakes and read past them. Once you do that, it's a good story about ancient civilizations, Atlantis, alternate dimensions and I'm expecting some aliens to come into the story soon. For those of you who enjoy Graham Hancock, this is a fun series. Whoever the copy editor was for this series, you should probably look for a new job."
5,An exciting read,"Don't read this book if you haven't read the first one in the series (""Atlantis""). Knowing that the big bad ancient monster (or forces??) is still out there breathing down our necks, this book divided into two different plots, one past one present, of how to stop the dark forces from destroying mankind. After reading 2 books in the series, my opinion is the characters are kind of one dimensional. Still, the author made it up with interesting twists in plot and skillful way in weaving myths from different cultures into one entertaining story."
4,Good Sunday read,"This book in the Atlantas series is the sort that you can read a bit, put down for a week and then pick up again without thinking too much.It is perfect for reading on a Sunday or wet day - not too taxing but not too light either."
3,Not what they started with.,"Till recently I didn't even know that Slik Toxik had a 2nd album. I managed to scrape up a copy of this on cassette since it was way cheaper than the CD version and both are completely out of print. If you own or have heard their debut ""Doin' The Nasty"" then you may be let down by this album. To me it sounds like they kinda tried to cash in on the grunge that was popular at the time (1994). It is quite a bit heavier than their debut, but I feel it doesn't fit with Nick Walsh's vocals as good as the blues/hair band sound of their debut did. I hate to say it but that is also what probably killed this band. They broke up shortly after this release. At any rate, it wasn't a horrible album, but I would try to get the debut ""Doin' The Nasty"" instead of ""Irrelevant"", especially if you like your hair bands Skid Rowish. This really doesn't sound much like their first album, heavier but not quite right."
4,"Features ""Mack the Knife"" vocals from 1986","Already owning the 20-CD Reprise set, I purchased this CD hoping for the original (1984) version of ""Mack the Knife,"" as found on the vinyl LP. But it's not here, it's been replaced with the 1986 version (from the 20-CD set). Maybe Frank wanted the original version destroyed!It's still a fine album, maybe not his best, but worth owning."
3,Worth a listen for half of the songs,"Considering this is Frank's last REAL album (the two ""Duets"" CDs were novelty records) it deserves a place in everyone's Sinatra collection. Hearing his rendition of ""After You've Gone"", with the incredible band work on that song alone, makes it worth buying."
3,"""OLD"" FRANK on a MODERN ALBUM","This album is fun to listen too once or twice and then it gets old really quick. By 1984 Quincy had just about forgotten how to produce/arrange decent and timeless charts for a big band. His work with Frank and Basie blow this album away.The songs and the musicians are great, Frank sounds OK but the sound is too modern for a 68 yr. old singer. Compared to the 1981 masterpiece SHE SHOT ME DOWN, this album is weak.Had Frank used Billy May, Riddle, Hefti etc. this album would have sounded better."
2,"A valiant effort,but it is one of Frank's few misses.,,,","Which is OK,given his earlier contribution to great songs. Some of the arrangements,including the title track,sound like top 40 dreck. ""Teach me Tonight"" is fun,but somehow I get the feeling this fellow has had more than enough experience at age 68! ""Until the Real Thing Comes Along"" vainly attempts to surpass Dean's much earlier, much superior version. ""Mack the Knife"" gives Louis,Ella,and Bobby Darin their due, but can't match any of them.And some of the old standards get a ""B"" which is not bad,considering. This album is mainly almost an historic document showing how an old master and his friends are still trying,even if not too successfully. Then again,when one considers what the later (rock) generation will be doing at that age,it's just about impossible to imagine any of them making this kind of noble,if flawed,effort."
3,Nice watch but too big,"Nice watch and it comes in a beautiful case, but it's huge. Unless you have a huge wrist, I wouldn't recommend it. I ended up returning mine and amazon charged me for the return shipping. Amazon should alter their return policy."
3,cool watch BUT,"The watch is so nice BUT when I got it, I noticed that there was a slight dent on the bezel. It's not seen right away but if you further scrutinize you'd notice it. I did not bother to return it as I don't want to go through the hassle of returning stuff .... I hope next time AMAZON will thoroughly check on the stuff that customers are ordering from them before any shipment is made. AMAZON should ensure that the stuff will arrive in good condition. QUALITY ASSURANCE IS A MUST!"
5,Really great - price outrageous,I am so disappointed in Amazon. I buy most everything from them. But it really opens my eyes to see the price hike they put on their products. You can purchase 7 bottles (no tax and free shipping) for what it would cost for two bottles on Amazon. Worth setting up an account with Joseph's and ordering every few months.
3,"Taste good, but...","This syrup is very tasty. However, it has a laxative effect on your body. Sugar alcohols, maltitol being one, leaves one gassy and in some cases with diarrhea. One morning I made pancakes for my family. My son had diarrhea, and me and my daughters had very bad gas. I said to myself, it must have been something that we ate. I narrowed it down to the syrup because we all ate it. I looked at the ingredients on it and decided to look up maltitol and it sure enough said that it is a sugar alcohol and can have a laxative effect on the body. So I never used it again. So if anyone experiences discomfort after eating this syrup then know it is the cause."
3,watch your sugar alcohol!,"Sugar alcohols (such as maltitol) have laxative properties. If you are like my diabetic son (10yrs old), you pour a LOT of syrup on your waffles. The result can be loose stools and stomach cramps.The taste is fine."
5,Just like syrup!,What can I say. It is just like having the real thing.I use it with the Atkins All Purpose Bake Mix to make pancakes.
4,Great flavor!,"I have been searching for a maple syrup product that I can use in conjunction with a grain and sugar free lifestyle that does not contain artificial sweeteners, flavors or colors. I really like the strong maple flavor this product offers. It is sweetened with malitol, and that can give many people digestive upset. I had mild digestive upset, but it was far less than other products I have tried like this, with not nearly as intense maple flavor. You won't be disappointed!"
2,don't buy at amazon,"First - let me say this is far and away the best sugar-free syrup I've ever had. It's not watery, and has a great mapley flave. Five stars for Joseph's.However, I have no idea why Amazon charges so much! Go to josephslitecookies.com, their home webpage, and you can get for less than $3. Seriously. Google it first if you think I'm making this up. I've seen it on Amazon for as high as $9 a bottle, and you can get it direct for $3?!?I've lost a lot of my Amazon love since seeing some things like this, and then their whole middle finger to IL (anyone who was an affiliate in IL amazon gave the boot to because of Gov. Quinn's decision to tax them - thanks amazon for adding injury to insult and taking away the little guy's revenues too)."
1,"Tastes great, yet will NEVER BUY AGAIN!","This sweetener although highly expensive $9.99 for a tiny bottle tasted like the real thing. I used it on my low carb pancakes. Within the hours I had horrible stomach cramps and was very gassy. I thought it might be the pancakes but I used the syrup to sweeten something else. Again with the Gas Pains, I read reviews online that others suffered from the same problem due to the sugar substitute that is utilized. The bottle is around 80% full and will never use it again."
1,Slightly reminiscent of cough syrup.,"There are just some foods that bring the kind of nostalgia that washes over you like warm tropical water lapping at your feet... this syrup certainly jolted me back to my childhood... that is, being sick and being force-fed Robitussin.Maltitol must surely be what sweetens Robitussin. Seriously, it's quite distinctive."
2,Not what I thought.,"I thought this was real maple syrup. I guess I didn't read close enough, but I'll enjoy it anyway. Thanks"
5,Great!,I generally hate sugar free products and artificial sweeteners. This syrup is AMAZING and well worth the $$. No weird aftertaste and has a great maple-y flavor and a nice thick consistency. I love it!
5,Really Good Syrup! Highly Recommended!,"""Joseph's Original Sugar Free Maple Flavor Syrup"" is really very good tasting syrup. Being diabetic I have to watch all sugar and carbs, so was pleased to find the highly rated Joseph's sugar free syrup. The syrup has 0 net carbs, being sweetend with Maltitol. The flavor is as good, or better, as many ""regular"" maple flavored syrups on the market.Highly Recommended!"
5,BETTER than the real thing!,All I can say is WOW! I wish I could give joseph's sugar free maple syrup 6 stars. This is the best stuff hands down.
1,Beware the maltitol sweetener...,"I tried this syrup just to avoid all the calories in regular maple syrup. I used a moderate amount on my pancakes and thought it tasted pretty good. About an hour after eating, I began to paying the price for consuming a product containing maltitol as the sweetener. I've never had so much gas and intestinal discomfort (for about 8 hours). These are well known side-effects of consuming this sugar alcohol and I am quite surprised it's been mentioned in only 1 other review of this product on Amazon. Just Google ""maltitol side effects"" and you'll get the picture. In my opinion, this product should be not be sold until it is reformulated with another sweetener. There are much better sweeteners than maltitol."
5,Great Product,"I have been using Joseph's Lite Syrup for over a year, have introduced it to many of my friends and all who have tried it, love it. It's thick syrup with a real sugar/maple taste.After a local store dropped this product, I purchased two cases here through Amazon/factory direct for my friends and family. What I received is 12 leaking bottles with loose lids and 3 of them over half empty. I think Joseph's expects this because the outer of three shipping boxes was lined with a heavy plastic bag. The bottles read, refrigerate after opening, so for all I know, they are all spoiled.Joseph's has not responded to the E-mail I sent to their customer service and that is most frustrating.In summary, Great Product, but Joseph's doesn't care once they have your money."
1,Seriously? This product isn't sugar free.,"This product tastes good. It is technically sugar free, but what it uses effects blood glucose. It is in no way 0 net carb. They use maltitol, which has 75% the glucose absorbtion of sugar. This means, it isn't zero net carbs, but that the 9 carbs per serving are absorbed by the body as 6.75 net carbs. If you are doing a low carb diet, 6.75 carbs is a lot. That is fraud, and it isn't okay. Stay away from this product, it is a lie."
1,Type II diabetics beware!,"I purchased this product shortly after being diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. I have to agree with the other reviewers concerning the taste and texture of this syrup - it's amazing! BUT, for those of us who follow a strict diet and have an understanding of the glycemic index - the maltitol syrup used in this product has a GI of 75 ( table sugar = 100 )- which means that a sharp rise in blood sugar can be noted after consuming even a normal serving size of this syrup. The first time I used it I was very upset by my blood sugar test results 2 hours after eating but attributed the rise to the sugar in the pancake mix. The second time I used it, I had the same result but this time there was no sugar in the french toast....... So if you are only trying to use this product to lose or control your WEIGHT, then I'd say go for it. But diabetics, be cautious, and check your blood sugar levels."
2,"Delicious, but unfortunately...","MALTITOL. I had no idea what this meant when I poured it on my waffles about 1.5 hours before sitting an exam...... : | The syrup itself was surprisingly good though. It tastes just like regular maple syrup. I normally can't stand fake maple syrups, so, when I tried it, I really thought I'd lucked out. It's unfortunate that it contains this sugar alcohol though, as it apparently has a laxative effect on some people. So, if you're not sure if you're sensitive to it or not, make sure to only use a tiny bit at first and don't, excitedly thinking, 'So delicious! So few calories!,' dump it all over your breakfast like I did. D:"
2,I wish they hadn't used maltitol...,"I bought this syrup from a local store and decided to try it. I liked the taste of the syrup. However, I had no idea that maltitol was going to cause me terrible discomfort soon. I didn't even have a full serving which is a 1/4 cup (I believe). After I looked up the ingredients and googled maltitol, I realized that it was the cause of ALL my intestinal discomfort that day. I felt terrible and was in pain. Needless to say, the bottle went straight to the trashcan. So, unless you know for sure that sugar alcohols don't bother you I wouldn't try it."
2,"Wait for ""3D Modeling Using Form Z""","The book is helpful in understanding the capabilities of 3D modeling in Form Z. However, I bought this book with expectations that there were step by step instructions on performing the various modeling tasks that are available in the program. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I found much more help in the tutorials that can be downloaded at formz.com. Hopefully, ""3D Modeling Using Form Z"" will be much more helpful when it hits the shelves."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"This book was not helpful at all. The majority of the book is devoted to descriptions of menus, buttons, etc. But it does not tie any of these descriptions into any kind of coherent whole. What's the point of knowing what an individual button does if there is no follow-up on how to incorporate that knowledge into putting together a project. The extremely short tutorials are misleading. The book says it will show you how to do a barn, for example. And then at the end of the uncompleted barn , the tutorial refers you back to the buttons! The book feels like the three authors did separate parts of the book and they did not know what the others were writing. I do not recommend this book for anyone trying to learn form z on their own."
2,THE FRIENDLY DOBERMANS,"The first sequel to The Dobermans Gang, is a sweet story about the friendship between the brutalized dogs and an indian kid who really cares for them. It is also a story about revenge and freedom and is more in the tone of tender films such as Ben or Lassie. Is the most commercial of the three and is really fun to watch."
1,Get Out,If you are reading this you are probably in the Every Nation cult. Get out now.PS this is not the Devil there are many great churches out there your just not in one of them now.
2,Bristles come out,"Bought Colgate Active Angle toothbrushes on two different occasions, and both times experienced the same problem. Within a couple of weeks of regular use, bristles start coming out of their toothbrush head insertions. Never encountered anything like this with other toothbrushes, made by either Colgate or other reputable manufacturers. Unpleasantly surprised to see this poor quality coming from Colgate."
1,Poor Quality,"This was the second Waterpik shower massage that I've purchased. The first one lasted over a dozen years (and was still working), but the cheap plastic bracket (which is difficult to adjust) on this one cracked after only 2.5 years. When I bought a replacement Waterpik, it was defective, so I returned it, and am sticking with Speakman from now on.I'm very sorry to say that the quality of Waterpik products is not as good as it used to be, because I have experienced similar design and quality problems with its products for oral hygiene."
1,Don't Bother,I have used Water Pik shower massage shower heads since the '70s and have been very satisfied..........til now. I have trouble getting enough water out of it to get the soap off my skin. It's almost impossible to get shampoo and conditioner out of your hair with this thing.
3,Needs some improvements,"My mother got these for my 1-year-old this past Christmas. My daughter seems to enjoy playing with them regularly, but I am disappointed. There are only three colors for the chicks inside the eggs (2 chicks per color), so it limits their use for teaching colors. The facial features on the chicks do not contrast well with each chick's color, so matching them to the correct egg toppers is not as easy. As to another reviewer's complaint about the chirping noise, I actually prefer the subdued sound but wish that each egg (or at least every two) had it's own sound. I just saw an almost identical set on Amazon by International Playthings that seems to answer these problems, so I think I'll order it as a replacement."
5,The 8 month old LOVES this game!!,"My daughter is quite happy with this find! Her 8 month old LOVES the set. It is multifaceted having different colors, shape matching (the bottom of each egg fits into the matching shape of the carton, dexterity training (taking shells off and on the chicks), and face recognition (matching chicks and shells with the same face). Great find! I have to edit this review: Just spent 3 days with my grand baby - She LOVES this toy! She normally spends only minutes playing with a toy before becoming bored and moving to another one. She literally played with this toy the ENTIRE time!"
4,One of our family's favorites,"We received these as a gift for our 1-year-old who is now 4 and he still plays with them occasionally. His younger brother is almost 2 and loves them even more. Super durable, lots of fun to use in different ways - we ""cook"" them in our play kitchen, play hide and seek with them, learn about facial expressions and shapes, etc. Definitely one of the longer-loved items in our toybox. It's one I will keep for little ones who visit our house in the future when my kids are grown. A great idea for a gift for the 1-yr-old.I took off one star because the top requires a big kid or adult to open. If loose toys annoy you, this one might be too much to handle. You have to put each egg in it's proper spot to get the lid to close. A very minor inconvenience for such a great toy!"
4,Hide and Squeak Eggs,"This toy is very educational; it helps teach colors, shapes, and matching. I was disappointed with the squeaks from the chicks. There is not much sound."
5,Great choice for my one year old.,Got this for my daughters first birthday. She loved it immediatly. It is educational with the shape outlines on the bottom and isn't an obnoxious toy like many others on the market today. Very cute and different!
5,insightful ideas about nonnative educators,An edited book which make you different voices about non-native educators in English Language teaching
4,The book was sufficient for introductory courses.,"The book was easy enough for beginning readers, but lacked sufficient information for more advanced study. The accompanying study guide had many errors in it. I would not use the study guide under any circumstances. The exercises in the book were sufficient enough to stimulate and encompass the processes of social research. Also, this book is not for Psychology majors."
5,Excellent educational tool,"This book is exactly what I ordered, it is a great educational tool with the information that I need to be able to complete my assignments for my Literature class; and it has some very good myth stories that are interesting."
3,Good case for the money (cheap) but delivery slow...,Good case for the money (cheap) but delivery slow for me as it took over a month longer to receive than expected. Note handle sticks out a bit when fully closed as well as the wheels.
1,Informative but useless,"Consider this: I'm reformed and living in Idaho, not Moscow, ID, but Idaho. I hoped to be able to read this book and be able to use it when talking with many of the Wilson devotees around here. But I can't.Dr. Robbins' approach in this book was to turn theology into a personal attack on Doug Wilson's character. This is instead of using it as a forum for debating the theological fallacies of Wilson. He does go through Wilson's theology, but he can't drop the tone loathing that evident throughout the book.My word to Dr. Robbins: Get someone else to write another book that just discusses the theology. Something I can hand to people who like Wilson and doesn't put my friendship in jeopardy.Your book, while informative, is useless to me because it will never make it out of my book case. I will never be able to loan it to other believers. Your book is not what I want other believers to think Reformed thinkers sound like."
1,Sad...,"I couldn't hardly make it through half of this book, it is filled with so many false assumptions and conclusions, as well as venomous attacks, that the title is ultimately true of the authors and the content within...they are ""Not Reformed at All."""
5,If The Kid Can't Then Check Out The Time!,"From day one The Time had existed very seperatelyfrom Prince-period!Their grooves were leaner,the songs far morebasic and they pursued a funk groove that Prince generallyskimmed over!And by 1984's 'Ice Cream Castle' they hadn't changed too much.One important addition is that of stronger popmelodies,mostly due to their appearance in Prince's 'PurpleRain' movie I'm sure.But even that isn't enough to keep themaddningly-paced ""The Bird"" in check!""Jungle Love"" is a bit moresubdued but still 100% FONK while ""My Drawers"" rocks out a bitmore then usual.The title track is very interesting-it's along groove with semi-chanted lyrics and an oddball lyric aboutinterracial love.The two remaining tunes are ballads whitchnever catch fire (the only truely great Time ballad was'Gigalo's Get Lonely,Too' from the previous album) but'Ice Cream Castle' is still one of The Time's finest albums!"
3,Good But Not Quite Over The Top,"The Time was one of those bands that had its moment in the sun due to the influence of superstar Prince. Not to say that the band lacked talent as Morris Day sure had a style. However, The Time came on the scene at the height of the Purple Reign.Anyway, this six song CD consists of the two super hits Jungle Love and The Bird. Both of these tunes are great to get on the dance floor and shake your money maker to. Also, Ice Cream Castle and My Drawers are two additional strong tunes with good if repetive melodies. The Kid Can Make It is semi-memorable if a little long. The only real clunker is Chili Sauce which consists of endless rapping at a restaurant set to the background of a tuneless accompanyment of string laden synthesizers. No melody in sight on this one.Therefore the three star rating seems appropriate. Thise who like funky stylings similar to Prince might like this recording even more."
2,Very Average,"after coming off there Best Album with ""What time is it"" they release this very Average set.""Jungle Love"" was catchy&got alot of Love for a good minute as did ""The Bird"".I Liked ""My Drawers"" but overall this Album felt Campy&kinda Cold without any kind of knockout Punch.while there Performances in ""Purple Rain"" were tight it didn't translate to the Album though for me.while they got More Cross-over with this Album it also became there Watered Down Period.I always say that if Prince didn't have His Purple Claws all over this Band who knows How far&big they might have gotten?"
4,you gotta pretty car,"if you have ever even considered the prospect of becoming a pimp, morris day is your road map to the promised land. morris will teach you the art of picking up fine ladies in fine automobiles, and how to do this in style. he will teach you how to tempt the ladies with ice cream and chocolate, until they can't help but have a taste. just remember you need the threads, the posse, cash and a full size mirror to come your hair. when you enter into morris day's world, you need to look good."
1,Cheap Plastic,"I purchased one of these and the lid cracked after the third use, very cheap plastic, stay away."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"These cups are cheap plastic. Foolishly, I purchased 4 of them. The lids of 3 cracked after a couple of uses.The top is like a martini shaker, so you can't actually put a straw in it. I really don't see the point."
5,"Now, I Love It","While I have not read the entire novel (it is not due out until March) I have read three excerpts which have appeared in various literary magazines. The writing is crisp, lyrical, poignant and, above all, funny. Ms. Litzenberger has a unique world view which manages to be telling, wry and compassionate all at once. She has, almost single handedly, revived my faith in contemporary American writing. I will be first in line to buy the book when it comes out."
4,Clean and Poignant,"If you have brothers or sisters, you know the feeling Litzenburger portrays so well in Now You Love Me--the sense of argument and bond all jumbled in that crazy tension known as growing up. Combine that with a single mother struggling to ground her identity and sense of family according to her own terms, and you get a mixture that makes good fiction. Annie, the narrator, is nine years old and consistently conveys the kind of innocence and honesty one can appreciate."
5,Looking forward to the next book !!,"What a lovely little novel this is. I enjoyed every page, the author describes in detail so sweetly a quirky and loving family which could be her family or it could be yours. I have also read another of her books ""The Widower"" a story in which you will fall in love with every character !! I look forward to her next book !!!"
1,Incomprehensible,If you're looking for a book to get a layman's understanding of Yemen then avoid this one like the plague. It is totally incomprehensible even for someone with a university degree. It has clearly been written by an academic whose target audience are other academics. This book is as dry as the deserts around Yemen--rub this one too hard and it'll burst into flames! I tried to read it 3 times and couldn't get past page 10. THIS IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER BOUGHT FROM AMAZON. Now I have to buy YEMEN: DANCING ON THE HEAD OF SNAKES...which I understand is a much easier read.
3,Disappointed in WA,"Fiesta 10-1/4-Inch Deep Dish Pie Baker, SunflowerThis was listed as a 10 1/4"" pie plate, but it's more like a 8 1/2"" - 9"". It's baking surface barely measures as much as a 9"" with a 10 1/4"" diameter outside ridge. It definitely was a disappointment as this was a gift to a pie baker. I found a 9"" ceramic pie plate in a store that was truely a 10"" of a prettier design."
4,Emilio Santiago one of the most amazing singer from Brazil,"Listen to Emilio Santiago is very exciting, by something is considered one of the greatest singers in Brazil and his style is truely amazing, I recommend this item, would be great let you catch by his voice and the adjustments of its wonderful productions, of this disc perhaps the only thing that could observe is that of the 29 songs that the DVD has, this single one has half, nevertheless, continues being highly recommendable."
5,Abduction,"Could you imagine being abducted by someone that you might know? And you find out your mom, sister, and dog had died?In this book, Denny wants a child of his own. So when Matt takes a quick trip to the restroom, he finds him self in a stranger's car. Will his sister Bonnie come for him? Read to find out!I like this book because there were a lot of twists and turns. It always made want to read more and more. The action would never stop. I recommend this book to people over 6 it is great!I hope you decide to read this book it is the best!"
1,Not funny,"I read a review that this book was funny. I laughed only once. I read in on vacation in the Bahamas. Not the best idea, a real downer. Too bad she's Canadian, I had high hopes."
5,makes ya think and laugh at the same time,"really shows how the masses get prayed on. And it gives you an out, if you catch the message. Start looking in the mirror and asking the right questions."
4,Do you want to understand the the economic crisis better? Watch this video,In this film Covel asks a lot of questions. But a main point is to get people to think about who is responsible for their financial situation. Are you willing to take responsibility for your situation or is it more comfortable to blame others? Watch this video and decide if you want to be broke or willing to work to be successful.This film is worth every penny if you are willing to think about the what Covel is trying to communicate.
5,Broke Review,"Being in China when the 2008 financial crisis started, I didn't get a first person perspective as to what really happened. Yes, the stock market tanked. Yes a few banks went under. But there was not much information regarding what really happened to the people in the US (main street).The documentary goes in depth and shows what happened to the American neighborhoods where people lost their houses; how families were robbed.One of the most striking scenes was a part where a vacant house was robbed of its kitchen tables and utilities. This shows desperation and gives a glimpse on what happens when greed takes control.I recommend this documentary to everyone who wants to know what happen in 2008."
5,Very good summary of the crisis America is facing,Trader and author Michael Covel has created a great documentary about the problems that caused the housing and credit crisis and the problems we are going to face going forward.He outlines many problems with the stock market and his opinion for how investors and traders can protect themselves from what is to come. This is a very good and entertaining documentary.
1,Save Your Money,"Save your money and buy the Constitution in book form. This is just the text to read off of a scrolling screen. There are no other visuals and no sound. I love the Constitution, but this video could have been made by anyone who can type."

4,Plastic. Best for ceiling use. No shut off louvers.,"Nice looking vent and at a great price. It has no shut off louvers like the $10 vents have. But who uses them anyway? Since this is plastic. It may not be safe over a floor vent. Could break if someone stood on it or if a furniture leg was placed on it. To install it in the cieling. Holes must be drilled in it, which is good because I can put the holes where and to the size that works best for the cieling airvent. Perfect for my needs. four stars because I dont rate it strong enough for a floor vent."
5,Love the shower,"Good product, very easy to install. I did remove the water saver constrictor as we have low water pressure. Love the shower."
5,Love Lindsey Sands,I got hooked on Lindsey with her vampire novel series Arg. But a friend told me about her historical romances. This was a very good read
4,Excellent!!!,"Another MRB (Must Read Book)..Do not miss this one, as Lynsay Sands again manages to hit just the right spot.. Just the perfect touch of humor and romance.."
2,Just not that funny.....,"I know that I am in the minority, but honest, I'm not one of those ""spoilers' who has to harshly critique great books. I really love Lynsay Sands humor, but I just didn't think this was that funny. I smiled a few times, but as for that laugh out loud humor that Sands is famous for..this isn't the book.Maybe it was the whole witch theme, maybe it was Willa that I just never really ""got"" with her wolves for friends and cluelessness, maybe it was Hugh who so stupidly went about trying to court Willa, or maybe it was the long, drawn out explanation of her origins that left me skimming to end the misery as quick as possible.....whatever it was, I can't recommend this book.I do recommend this author. My favorite book of hers is ""Bliss"". Now that is romantic comedy if I've ever read it. Skip this one and try that one first...you won't be sorry."
4,"A very detailed, but very worth-it book","Okay, I'm not one who likes to have to keep track of numerouscharacters, and this book challenged me to the limits in thatregard, but that aside, I thought it was a very good read.I must say, though, that part of the charm for me was yet anothercover with Stefan Andreas Schwarze featured. That man is the Brad Pitt of romance cover models, let me tell you!!!Anyway, Stefan Schwarze aside, I did enjoy this book very much.The perserverance of the main character was exlempary. I think he would still be sitting in the rain right now, if not for theevent that changed the course of the book. I must say, Willa gotover Hugh being snotty in the wink of any eye. I would have thought her unhappiness with his attitude would have lasted longer than it did. I must say she is a very forgiving woman.I will read another Lynsay Sands book again, but for now, I'mtaking a break from them to try out some other authors I think Imight be intrigued by."
4,Really well done,"This biography of Dzoghen, the father of Japanese Zen Buddhism is clearly based on fact and is a good way to learn about the origins of Zen. But, beyond that, it is a darn good story told by a well made movie. I recommend this to anybody interested in Zen or religions of the world."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!,"It is very stupid! It is confusing,And instead of moving around with the Joystick,you move with the A button! It is SO sensitive,that by the time you get your cross hairs for your Plasma Blaster thing on the enemy,The robot enemy had already got about 10 hits on you! If you are into Mutiplayers,don't buy this either! Me and my dad played Multiplayer and after 5 minutes we still couldn't find each other(Because of no radar) so we got bored of it and turned it off. The enemies blend in with the dark backround too,so you can't see them. Do NOT(!!!!) buy this game!"
3,Ive never gotten carsick from a video game before,"I got this game at a great price and couldn't pass it up. At first it was kind of fun, but after a while I noticed that I wasn't feeling too hot. Something about the 3D motion in this game makes me nauseated. It's plenty difficult and the multiplayer is pretty fun, but this game is not for the squeamish."
3,Better options,"I had looked at this item, as I wanted something to hold my coil hose. However, I bought a similar one (looks like this, but deeper) at Target for only $20. It holds my 75' coil hose just fine and it's wrought iron."
2,OK when it worked,"This unit worked great for about 6 months and now will only flash ""-888.8"" I replaced the battery and that didn't help. The small ""manual"" doesn't offer any Troubleshooting suggestions and no website or phone number for the manufacture. Made in China. I suggest that prospective buyers buy a better quality IR thermometer.... one that offers some support if it ""goes south."""
5,A touch of class for everyday,"OK, the kids are growing up and these add a touch of class to the dining table. It is with great pleasure I retire the Ikea glasses. They are a nice heavy glass with a unique cut to them. I thought about the more traditional cut but am glad we got this one."
5,Great product at a good price,This item was on sale and is a replacement for a Campy records post. This is an excellent post at one third of the price of the Campy one.
1,sharks(endangered),"this book introduces readers to three threatened species of sharks.in short chapters illastrated with color photographs,accurate and fairly objective information is shared.piror to profiling the three types,the text defines how sharks differ from other ocean-dwellers.following the overview,the problems faced by great white sharks,whale sharks, and basking sharks are discussed."
1,Body by Jake Cardio Cruiser,I have had my Cardio Cruiser for three years. The tension knob slips so you cannot increase tension. The cable broke and I can not get anyone to answer where I may purchase a replacement. Phone calls go unanswered. Emails tell me to go back to where I purchased the item - I tell them I purchased over the internet.Don't waste your money.
1,junk !!,"I too broke my cable. I cannot find any replacement parts. I actually called and ordered the part on 3/2/09, and Sherse said it would be 4-6 weeks. I called yesterday, 4/20/09 and customer service has now moved to India. I was told that they do not have any replacement parts and never did, and Sherese misled me. I asked to talk to her, and was told that she does not work for the company anymore !! Of course not, Sherese was in California, India would be an awful long commute !! I was told to go ""google"" replacement parts !! I was livid !!! I asked the guy what to do and he tried to sell me the NEW AND IMPROVED PLUS MODEL. How hysterical is that !! Mine has always squeaked, it leaves oil spots all over the floor, rubber grommets disinegrate from somewhere, and the tension never did work !! How do you say SUCKER !! Now, I am stuck withanother piece of junk excersise equipment..."
2,not so great,"great concept and area of focus,but the delivery method is cheap and noisy. there is no way to make this machine quiet down if you use it at 50% of it's potential. don't even try to use it at 100% potential, the knobs will not turn(and it's unbearably loud)..no matter how hard you try. we had to use brute strength to turn up the resistance...not a good deal for the $180.00.Spend the big bucks for the x-ride."
1,"Loud, High-Pitched Squeaks","I bought the Cardio Cruiser hoping for something quiet I could use while watching TV. The first few minutes of my workouts were just fine, but then it would start: the squeak. And not just any squeak. This was a loud, high-pitched squeak that drove my pets to the far corners of my house and drowned out the television! I disassembled the machine and checked the parts, and found that with any tension applied, the machine had too much friction on the tubing and was grinding itself into tiny bits. I tried WD-40, lithium grease and a spray lubricant recommended as ""the best lubricant we have"" at Lowes, all to no avail. I would lubricate the machine, put it back together (no small undertaking) and within five minutes of starting my workout, the machine would begin its squeaking symphony all over again.The only workout I ended up getting from this machine was taking it apart, lubricating it and putting it back together."
4,strwaberry smoothie,"I was surprized at the freash strawberry taste. These are good, a little pricey, but good."
3,Fill Her up,"This does the trick. It is a good snack that will keep you satisfied for a while, but I recommend the Cafe Latte. The strawberry flavor is not as good."
4,Good...,"I admit that these aren't really smoothie-like, but they taste strongly of strawberries, they're sweet enough to satisfy that sugar craving, but it does it in a natural way with the addition of fiber and not empty calories. I liked it a lot. Hope this helps. To be candid though....the fiber goes to work pretty fast."
3,Not as good as chocolate,"I love the Lightfull Smoothies. However, the strawberry isn't nearly as tasty as the chocolate or the peach."
5,Yumm-OOO!,"I was so impressed by the taste (exceptionally yummy), calories, low sugar, protein, and fiber that I ordered them for all of my adult children and my grandchildren. My grandson is a picky eater and he says they are awesome!"
5,Hard to go wrong with strawberries,"Tasty and filling. Great for a quick snack or breakfast. Doesn't have a ""health food-y"" quality to it, anyone should like this!"
1,Not very tasty,This definitely was a disappointment. Perhaps the taste just takes some getting used to. It did not take like any smoothie I've ever had. I ended up giving most of the case to a friend that eats anything.
3,shelia e's drumming is the only star,shelia's drumming is the only really good thing about the record.her voice as is the cases with prince's female camp lacks vocal power except for jill jones&mavis staples.the music was cooler at the time and haven't aged well.still shelia drumming and grooving on glamorous life is the real highlight of another average record.
5,Prince Strikes Gold with Sheila E.,"The debut album from Sheila E. is her best recording ever. The title track speaks for itself as Sheila lays the foundation for her arrival under the purple umberella. Sheila jams from beginning to the end proving that she has more talent than Vanity and Apollonia together. The Belle of St.Mark opens the cd and is followed by the instrumental sounds of Shortberry Strawcake. Noon Rendezvous and Next Time Wipe the Lipstick Off Your Collar are her signature slow songs. We all know the popular and famous dance track Glamorous Life which can bring most parties and dance floors to a standing room only dance scene. Prince found true talent this time and to him I say ""Thank You"". This talented female drummer and singer proves that her time has come and her reign is forever."
3,Axe to grind with the Mormons?,"Having a sister who is Mormon, I read ""Higher Authority"" with interest and expectation. I had never read any other of White's books so Lauren Crowder was new to me. My experience with Mormons is that they are strong prosyletizers and I can't see John Harley giving information that easily. They do in fact give you limited information when you ask questions in real life so I find Harley hard to believe. I feel while it places the Mormon (LDS) Church in a negative light - I, also, feel it might serve their purposes in that they would have more people exploring to see if it was correctly portrayed and may get caught up in the Missionary's zeal in presenting their views. Many spots leave you trying to figure out if the author really researched all the geographical features. For entertainment, I enjoyed it but I had trouble with all the negative - ism."
1,Ugh...,"This book was dreadful... I read about half of it and scanned the rest. Author Stephen White is amazing and he deserves at least one bad book. This was it, for me. This is the only Alan Gregory book missing from my collection and I don't miss it one bit. In my opinion, read the Alan Gregory novels in order, but skip this one. If you need a 'fix' before Mr. White's next book comes out, come to this one. Otherwise, don't bother."
3,"Over the Top, But Entertaining","Many reviewers have stated that this book comes down rather hard on The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and I agree that some of the scenarios are rather extreme in almost any context. Nevertheless, as I am not offended by irreverent writings, even those about my own United Methodist Church, I was entertained by the book. Some things were implausible as described, if not physically impossible, but they were easy to overlook.I find White's insight into the minds and motivations of his characters to be the main appeal of his books. Reading them provides an insight and self analysis that are almost like therapy."
3,Higher Authority,"I'd recommend this book to anybody who is interested in learning more about, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a.k.a. The Mormon Church. If nothing else, the background information about the church made it worthwhile. The Mormon religion certainly has a strange history and some questionable practices. However, I think any large organized religion could be an interesting backdrop for a novel of this genre. We all know that churches are capable of abuses of power and cover-ups. We all know that gross injustices and crimes are committed all the time in the name of God.I have no regrets about reading this book; all in all it was pretty good, even though it was a slower read than Stephen White's first two books in this series. The next book in line, goes back to featuring Dr. Gregory, I think I will like that more than this installment which, demonstrated Lauren as the main character."
4,"Interesting as a thriller, if inaccurate as to Mormonism.","As a born and bred Mormon, active and faithful, I read this story because it sounded intriguing. As a story, it lives up to its promise of mystery and excitement. I was dismayed at the Mormon bashing, and only want to tell prospective readers that the author has no real factual knowledge of the LDS Church and what life is really like in Utah. The truth is really simple and there's no mystery to it at all. Utah is far from a theocracy, and Church leaders do not dictate our actions, much less our thoughts. Unfortunately, the plot and premise of this book depends heavily on the possibility that even murder would be considered an option rather than have politically high-placed individuals exposed for practices which are not condoned by the Mormon religion. If you keep that in mind and discount 95% of what the author says about politics and religion in Utah, I do recommend the story."
3,Not for the easily offended,"This Stephen White entry is a good suspenseful mystery set in Utah. If you are Mormon or find a calling to higher religious authority you will be offended. But for the rest of us, you will discover a moderately good book that could have used an editor to par it down by 100 pages. As far as I can tell from current and ex Mormon friends, the portrayal is accurate."
2,Hatchet job on the Mormon church,"Two things struck me about this book. First, that it had a remarkably thin, pointless plot. I had trouble caring about any of the characters. Which convinced me that I am correct about the second point -- that the narrative was nothing more than a container for an attack on the Mormon church. I'm not a Mormon and have a lot of trouble with what the LDS church believes. But if you're going to write a book attacking a religion, why waste everyone's time with a wimpy story line upon which to hang your attacks? In my view, this was nothing more than The Da Vinci Code approach, but unleashed on Mormons."
2,This is vendetta disguised as a boring novel,"I've read a number of Stephen White novels before, and have been favorably impressed. That's why I purchased this one without reading any reviews. I'm not a Mormon, and have no real opinion of their religion either way. What I can say is that this novel reminds me of a jilted lover talking about their ex. The plot seems secondary to White's need to tell the reader what I'm sure he considers dirty little Mormon secrets. The first time he mentions them, it's an interesting part of the novel. After repeating the same things over and over again, it's simply boring.As for the plot and the execution of the novel, it's slow-moving, tedious, and he seems to want to rush it to and end after he's been rambling on too long.I bought two more White books when I bought Higher Authority. I can only hope those are better."
1,No success.,I purchased this product after reading that some buyers had good success in lowering their cholesterol with it. No such success with me. It was worth a try since I cannot tolerate statins.
1,"Sorry, this is a waste of money.","I took this product for 3 months, the 1200 MG size, and my next blood test at my Doctor's office showed absolutely no change in my cholesterol. He told me to toss the red yeast rice and tripled my Niaspan.I would give this product ZERO stars but am forced to put at least one."
1,Consumer beware,"In the United States (including Canada) it is no longer legal to sell supplements containing the specific ""strain"" of Monascus purpureus that was used in the red yeast rice studies. You can still buy red yeast rice supplements in your local health food store; however, these supplements are produced using a different strain of yeast or fermentation process than those used in the studies. The red yeast rice products may have little or no cholesterol-lowering effects."
1,"What's up with these prices? Way, way, way overpriced","Who's ""Zina"" ? I buy a lot of quality sterling silver jewelry - and have never paid prices anywhere near the prices of this brand - All of their jewelry offerings are production factory made and for the most part you can find either identical or nearly identical pieces at local brick and mortar stores for 1/3 or less of the price.Save your big $'s for pieces that are artisan crafted, individually made, artist signed pieces."
3,Better than nothing to dip into milk!,I've had several versions/flavors of this product and while none are an Oreo they are a reasonable alternative. Don't love them but I like them.
2,DON'T KNOW,MY ORDER WAS WRONG AND DIDN'T RECEIVE THEM. MY MONEY WAS REFUNDED SINCE THEY SENT 2 OATMEAL INSTEAD. OATMEAL TASTE BAD.
4,Waterpik Battery Operated Flosser,"This is my second Waterpik flosser. I dropped the first one and it broke. I have been using one for two years now and I think it is great. It saves getting cuts on my hands from regular flossing when my skin is dry. The only drawback is that this flosser does not reach behind the last tooth (on all sides) so you need to use a small piece of floss for those areas. In order to prevent excess plaque buildup, my periodonist recommended alternating use between the Waterpik flosser and manual dental floss which I have been doing."
5,Positive results for over 4 years,I picked this up at a dental convention and really like the results. I have the 110 model with the replaceable battery and I'm still on the first battery (your mileage may vary). I also use a Braun flosser but the tips are no longer made and are hard to find.
3,"The appliance is fine, but..","For as far as it goes, it works fine. 2 big drawbacks:1. The tips are hard to come by. I bought the last replacements from Amazon - the price is similar to what I paid for some I found locally, but the ship costs really kill the price. I bought from Amazon because I couldn't find the tips again locally.2. They are not a complete replacement for manual floss. I bought the item for my kids, to help them floss around their braces. It's a help, but not a total solution"
4,Waterpik Flosser Tips,"I have been using these flosser piks for a few years. The Waterpik flosser was recommended by my dentist because my teeth are very close together and traditional flossing takes a lot of time. With the waterpik flossers I'm able to floss very quickly in the mornings. My teeth cleaning experiences have been much, much better now that I use the flossers."
3,Replacement tips not up to the task,I have been using the WaterPik flosser for over a year now and really like the unit. It was especially useful while I was wearing braces. The original unit came with aqua-colored tips that were much sturdier than the white replacement tips. They seem to hardly stand up to more than one use. Disappointing.
1,waterpik flosser,batteries are old and won't rechargeand they are not replaceablenot worth the moneyI didn't even get to use it once
5,"Experience, / more than IQ to appreciate / corporate Haiku!","It takes the honesty of reflection about what truly happens in the workplace, to possibly deeply appreciate this work... William Warriner captures all the subtle nuances of 'relationships' in offices, all the 'usually unsaid'behind the statistics! savour.......Heat shimmers from cars / surrounding my parking space; /they all want my job.He has a certain sense / that history begins / with his arrival.In youth, we learnt that / a company must grow; now/we teach it to shrink"
4,"No ""Sex Shooter"" on this soundtrack","Some labels just have a habit of excluding certain song(s) off movie soundtracks. There are some songs or instrumental beats in a movie that a person may love and hence purchase the soundtrack not for the heck of it but because of that song(s). But leave it to Prince to exclude Apollonia's ""Sex Shooter"" and the beautiful piano arrangement/piece whatever you want to call it, which was played by his ""on-screen"" father on the piano. But hey, you can't win 'em all. However, the soundtrack is delicious. Prince is sexy and the lyrics are orgasmic---apps~"
3,The Prince currently known as Artist,"Prince has one thing in common with many other musicians, i.e. he can't act. Purple Rain, the movie, was really bad. On the other hand, Purple Rain, the album, was great. It did, and still does, rock (in a kind of retro 80's way).Princes crazy falsetto screeching was his trademark (as was his apparel of taffeta and lace). Just ask D'Angelo where he gets his harmonies and vocal style? From none other than Prince.As for me, I loved this album when it came out, the heavily reverbed drums and dated synth sounds helped fashion the eighties. The songs are still good, but the album as a whole has lost its original tang. Should be great for school reunions though!"
3,Wish there was an original score to this disk,"I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm in love with this cd and the movie. The movie just moves me to pieces. But come on, there were alot and I mean ALOT more songs in the film that were not included on the cd. I wish that they would stop excluding certain songs, for whatever reasons, off the movie soundtrack. If you're gonna have it in the movie, then have it on the cd too. That's just my arguement.Maybe this cd doesn't deserve the 3 stars that I'm giving it. I'll admit to a large percentage of the songs on it, I love. Like ""The Beautiful Ones"", Mariah's version doesn't come close, and ""Take me with you"". I only wished songs featured in the movie, were featured on the cd. Prince wasn't the only artist in the movie, so his work should not have been the only songs on the disk."
2,Doesn't stand the test of time!,"I got the record mainly 'cos I wanted the song ""Purple rain"". The rest of the material doesn't stand the test of time. Maybe you will play ""Let's go crazy"" and ""When doves cry"" once a year (when you get togheter with your old time friends and get nostalgic) but I don't think you'll actually listen to this album... And I you don't have any references to, or memories of the time this album was released I think it's a waste of money"
5,Purple Rain is great!,"This album came out around the time I was born, so you could say I came to Prince late. But I am glad that I bought this album. All of the songs are great, especially ""Let's Go Crazy"", ""When Doves Cry"" (the long version, which is better than the edit), and ""Purple Rain"", one of the most beautiful songs ever written and recorded. ""Darling Nikki"" is also one of Prince's best. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves the 80s or Prince."
5,The Purple One does it Again,"1984 and Michael Jackson is the biggest star on Earth but that same year another POP Icon Emerges from the Shadows to become equal to his rival his name is the one and only Prince, with a Hit movie, Soundtrack and Tour in 84 Prince was now the face of the Earth thanks to this Classic album.Favorite Songs In Order...1.The Beautiful Ones2. I Would Die 4 U3. Purple Rain4. When Doves Cry5. Take Me With U6. Let's Go Crazy7. Baby I'm A Star8. Darlying Nikki9. Computer Blue (worst song on the album)"
4,Darling NiKKi,"This was the first Prince album I've listened to, and I must say has most of my favorite songs on it. And although my most-loved on the Purple Rain soundtrack is of course the title song, ""Purple Rain,"" I must say that I have offically dubbed ""Darling Nikki"" as my theme song."
5,Prince's Greatest Album but still EDITED!,"This is by far the greatest album he ever released. But even after 20 years we still can't hear the unedited version, unless you have those horrible sounding bootlegs. All the songs (except When Doves Cry and Purple Rain) were edited down for the movie. Hearing the songs unedited makes them that more enjoyable and you understand the context of the incredible songwriting. Its a shame Computer Blue was edited from 13 minutes to a mere 4 minutes. Hearing the unedited Computer Blue I realized this is the greatest song he ever did to date. I just hope one day we will all get to hear Purple Rain album UNEDITED"
1,I don't get it!,"Before I write this, let me just say that I expect either harsh criticism or even abuse because I really don't like this album. I bought it because it is so highly regarded, and after repeated listening, I still dislike it - a lot. This is Jimi Hendrix meets Michael Jackson, interspersed with new wave, schmoozey jazz, pop... and it is a marriage made in hell as far as I am concerned. Sure, Prince can play a guitar. But that doesn't make it art. The missing ingredient is soul. This album is devoid of it. It is cold, clinical, unmoving, empty. I have not seen the movie and so am not biased by having visuals to add any value that might be lacking in the music. I gave it one star because one can't give less. And now I'm going to try to sell it for $1. I don't even want this soul-less cacophony occupying space that could be filled by a genuine masterpiece."
4,A Solid 80's Release,This recording was a captivating moment during the decade of the eighties. Prince was able to merge funky soul with rock n roll into one creative musical work. Lets Go Crazy and Purple Rain have some searing guitar licks. And the Beautiful Ones have some of the most passionate vocals of Prince's career. Some of the songs could use an extra hook or two but all them have plenty of tasty grooves. This disc can appeal to many audiences.
5,One of my favorite albums of all times...,"I know these reviews are for the items not Amazon service, but I just wanted to include how satisfied I am with the MP3 downloads and services. That said, Purple Rain is, in my opinion, Prince's greatest album. It isn't often that a fan can love ALL the songs on one album..a mix of songs from many albums, yes..but not every song. I grew up in the 80's and Purple Rain just reminds me of all that I loved from that time. The movie, Purple Rain, was okay, but I think the songs were the best part. Prince is a great artist and songwriter..I love how he mixes funk, dance and rock."
5,Who says a funk band can't play rock?,"That Minneapolis sound...wow, it has all been stated by others, but the intro to 'Purple Rain'...that BIG, lush, twangy, warm, full-bodied Rickenbacker 330/12 string is one of the masterpieces of Prince's career. He does more with those few bars than others do with an entire cd. It sets up a great song and lays the foundation for Prince to come in later with his odd looking, but razor sharp axe, and slice and dice his way through a song that has held up amazingly well since 1984...Man, what a guitar!"
5,One of the greatest albums of all time...period.,"This album changed my life. I can still remember the moment I dropped the needle on the record (record; not CD - that's how long ago it was) and heard the opening of ""Let's Go Crazy"", which is one of the best rock n roll songs you will ever hear. For me, the true sign of a great album is one that brings colors and images to your mind as you listen to it. Purple Rain did this and then we all saw how great the music was by seeing the film.""When Doves Cry"" and ""Purple Rain"" are masterpieces and established Prince as the genius of modern pop music."
5,Pop gold,"I call Prince a ""beginner's guide to electronic music"". Electronic music can be very beautiful but it can also be very scary to a person raised on classic rock. Prince melds uncountable genres - dance, funk, pop are the main ones, though. Not only do I respect him for bringing electronic music to the mainstream but I also respect him for the chances he takes. I respect anybody that takes chances but especially those that risk their reputation and popularity to do so. Sure, ""Sign O' The Times"" is probably his most experimental/avant-garde work but this is probably his strongest material. This album makes all of it's listeners feel dirty and great. It's a very fun album with not one second of filler. Sure, I was born over a year after the album was released but the novelty has not worn off in over 16 years since its release. This is one of the few popular things that does not (). A must in everybody's music library."
5,Just bought another copy,"I just bought another copy at Border's bookstore during a break from work. My old copy was on tape and badly damaged.I bought the tape after seeing the movie in france in spring 1985. I cannot believe that for me, all the music that has come in the last 20 years still cannot touch the quality, profound message, and energy of this album.I strongly recommend this album. The message is unique and the delivery flawless. You'll be transported, as I am each time I listen to it."
2,Not too happy,Kind of disappointed. Thought it was Prince's greatest hits. Guess I didn't read the description too well. My fault though.
1,pul-lease!,"This album was overrated back in 1984 when it was released, and it is painfully dated today. Prince's middle school obsession with sex was tiresome then, and is laughable now. Forget this junk."
1,Time Be Not Kind To The Purple One,"Prince has to be one of the most overated talents in the history of pop music. This self absorbed, annoying, hopelessly dated CD will have you scratching your head wondering how critics still persist in labeling Prince's tired gimmickry ""musical genious.""Prince's rocket fueled climb to the top of the artistic heap in the early eighties was promptly followed by a more rapid and well deserved plummet. It all started and ended here..."
4,Prince at his best!,We love this CD. The music from the movie Purple Rain is very good and a must-have for any fan of Prince.
4,One of the greatest is right here!,"This may not be the best Prince album to everyone (at least not to me), but everyone should own a copy of it in some form. You can't go wrong here. You got your number 1's (""When Doves Cry"", ""Let's Go Crazy""), your hit songs (""I Would Die 4 U"", ""Purple Rain""(personal #1)), a ballad (""The Beautiful Ones""), and even some sex (""Darling Nikki""). An excellent album!!"
2,Poorly constructed toy won't fit together,"What a disappointment. My 7 year old son was so excited to get this Narnia toy. He loves putting things together. The way Mega Block makes the pieces, they don't always fit together properly. He was frustrated and in crying after 15 minutes. His older brother tried to help and even his father; the pieces were not made correctly. He was devastated. If you're going to make a building block set, make sure the pieces fit. Never had a problem with legos like we did with this product."
5,The Savage Earth the DK Way,"DK Guide to Savage Earth by Trevor Day is an exciting introduction to our fascinating planet for preteens. The book starts with the Big Bang and takes the reader through the whole range of earth sciences-related events and ends with human effects on the planet. The book is done in the DK style with stunning pictures and short, to-the-point explanations. The book has a good index, data tables, and glossary at the end of the book. This would be an excellent book for the late elementary/early junior high aged young person showing an interest in nature or our planet. The subjects are handled calmly and objectively, but could produce worry in the more faint of heart child. Some students come into my earth science class thinking that the Earth is pretty boring compared to other planets like Venus or Mars, but learn differently once they've been introduced to our very interesting planet. Introduce your favorite young person to our planet with DK Guide to Savage Earth!"
5,fantastic,"Lane is a great surprise, his humor and poetry keep you glued to the book until you finish ( and you won't do anything until you do finish)"
1,Terrible. Got no use out of the entire bag.,When I received the bag about 40 percent of the beads were already crushed to power and the others appeared to be so old that they crumbled thereafter. It was like no version of tapioca I have ever dealt with before.
5,MAKING BOBA AT HOME IS THE BEST!,"I go out to get bobaDrinks 2-4 times a week, now I make it at home!This boba is soft and chewy add your own sugars or honey after you cook it!EASY EASY EASYBOIL, POUR, and WAIT 5mins(for a chewy texture) or 5mins+/desired amount of time for a softer texture. (I prefer the softer texture so I would keep it in the boil for 3+mins and then turn off the heat and close the lid and let it sit for another 5mins. (Clear instructions are also on the back of the bag)This boba doesn't even fall apart! Like the other ones would.GREAT PRODUCTWOULD AND WILL BUY AGAIN."
1,Gross,These are small and crumbled in my hand. They also have a weird maple syrup-like smell and taste. I'll be ordering more expensive pearls in the future.
1,Blechhhh,"I read ALL the reviews from other people and ugh. I made a mistake on this one. I should have order the ones with coloring and flavoring. I thought I would be frugal and a little more healthy. This has ""maple syrup"" taste and the cooking smell is just AWFUL. If I hadn't been the one cooking it and someone made it for me... maybe I could have enjoyed it."
3,They're okay...,"For the price they're okay.My bag came still vacuum packed, but I could tell they were pretty crumbly just from handling the bag.Following the instructions gave a decent end result. They were a little too soft for my liking, but I'll have to fiddle with the timing and see if I can make them work. They are bigger than the instant boba, but still not as big or as chewy as what I've been accustomed to. I used to live in Seattle where I could get boba practically anywhere, but now I live in a dinky midwestern town and the closest boba place is a two and a half hour drive.So until I can afford to move to a bigger city, this will be a decent replacement for the lack of bubble tea in my life."
3,Undecided,"I did not know what I was buying when I purchased this item. At first I was puzzled that it was not black, after all it is ""black"" tapioca. I was planning to use the black tapioca in chocolate tapioca pudding. I went ahead and cooked some and discovered it does indeed turn black after cooking. But now I am not sure what to do with it because the package directions are unclear. I did an internet search for some bubble tea recipes which should not be necessary. None the less, the tea looks interesting."
4,Good taste and chewiness,"I liked the taste and texture. However, one of my packages arrived with the vaccuum broken and the balls had turned to complete dust. I wrote to customer support, but have yet to hear from them.You have to boil the balls for 30 minutes, covered, let them sit for another 25 minutes, still covered, then rinse them in cold water. Then you coat them in sugar syrup, which you make by simmering equal parts of sugar and water."
4,Bubble Tea Black Tapioca,"Overall good quality. These tapioca balls aren't as large as what I sometimes get at the teahouse, but they have a good flavor and texture."
3,Not what I expected,"They were easy to make, but I did not like the taste of them at all, even after putting them in a simple syrup, agave, honey, etc."
5,A treat for feet!,"Let's face it, we give our feet a hammering and they are not often rewarded for their trouble. Well this is like having a spa, a reflexologist and pedicurist all rolled into one.An absolute joy and you don't have to worry about your tootsies looking or smelling at bit rough, it won't complain!I highly recommend to walkers, active folk and people whoes jobs have them on their feet a lot (Nurses, Teachers, Builders etc). You wont regret it and neither will your feet, may just save trips to Chiropody clinics in your dotage!"
2,WaterPik FS-015 Pedicure Foot Spa,I bought this pedicure Foot Spa for my wife who works in a Hospital and is on her feet all day. She reports that the agitation action is not powerful enough to stimulate circulation in the feet. The first unit I received leaked water after 5 minutes of use and I had to return it. The second unit didn't leak. I can't recommend someone else buying this product based on our experience
4,Good Machine,"This is a good machine. One of those things you buy, use a couple times and put away forever."
3,not what I expected,"Kind of cheap and not really what I expected. It's not bad, but don't expect too much."
1,Not worth it.,Bought this for my wife and she used it a couple times and put it away never to use it again so I'm assuming I wasted my money. If it gave her any relief and was effective she would still be using it.
3,A Little Too Bright,This lipstick is very creamy and rich. I like the texture but the red is a little too bright. When I wear the lipstick I use a gloss over it and that sort of tones it down.
3,"Great colors, but drying","I love all the colors that NARS offers, especially in their lipstick. I have this in Catfight and I love the color. It is extremely long-wearing and I rarely need to reapply during the day. Unfortunately, though, the lipstick is a bit difficult to apply because it's kind of dry, and it's also drying on the lips. I've also found that this lipstick doesn't last as long as other brands because it tends to harden in the tube. I've never finished an entire NARS lipstick without having it dry out on me first. There are better products out there."
5,Just like I remember!,"It came in the original packaging. LOVE the color - goes on a deep classy red, not at all orange. Flawless. Thank you!"
3,Like a Day at the Ballpark,"This reads pretty much like the other Mickey Rawlings books. It's a fun read, not much more, but mixes two popular pastimes, baseball and amateur sleuthing, quite well. This book is like a day at the park: slow in some places, intriguing at others, relaxing at the right moments, and full of history and spark and pep. And it takes less time to read than most games take to play now.Soos is not a great writer, but he does what he sets out to time and again. If you love old-time baseball, or mysteries, read this. And even if you just love baseball, read this. The mystery is less important than the sense of love and passion Soos brings to Rawlings and his real and fictional baseball cohorts."
4,Will save you money,I've used these filters for about 2 years now (with the whole water dispenser bottle system).They are great. They really do make tap water taste like bottled water.You need to change the filter about every 4 months even though it says 6 months. That may just be because we drink a lot of water.Over all a great product!
5,Unique and Beautiful,"I am building a charm bracelet with charms that represent my family. A favorite cousin is a blacksmith, so the anvil was perfect. It's even greater in person than in the photo!"
4,Pretty Good,"This was the 3rd book in the series and it wasn't disapointing, it was just that alot of things just didn't make sense. The first two books were alot better, only because they made more sense"
2,Lacking...,"This book is the conclusion to the 3 book series, and to tell the truth it just doesn't seem to exist in reality. It is a tale of how college girls play a game to ""hook up"" with 26 guys whose names all start with the different letters of the alphebet. In this concluding book it seems like the author was trying to make it a mystery/detective novel while at the same time trying to be edgy. In the end they all seem to have become better more sucessful people due to the fact that they ""hooked up"" with these random guys. I just don't see the contemperary world agreeing with the outcome."
3,Vietnam Gangs in LA,"Police Lt. Luke Able is part of a special task force that works ""Bolsa Strip"", a LA Suburb. Asian youth gangs with automatic weapons terrorize this once nice community. A community which has filled with hard working people from South Vitenam. Typical story, Able and ex-MP from Old Saigon, brings his experience to ""The Bolsa"" where he knows the language, culture and the people."
5,The Standard,Can't complain. These mugs do the trick. I was looking for restaurant quality mugs for beer and these were exactly it. Very heavy and durable. Sure to last a long time. They were also a great price.
5,Great Mugs,Nice thick beer mugs. Can't go wrong with these.Perfect for keeping in the freezer. These things are heavy (because they are good). No sharp edges like cheaper sets out there.
3,Annoying to wash,"These mugs are very sturdy, freeze well, and hold a fair amount of liquid.My complaint and irritation with these mugs lies in the fact that they have a concave bottom. This means they collect a gross amount of [potentially dirty] water in the dishwasher. Because I work and go to school full-time, if something can't be washed in the dishwasher, I don't like to use it. So, I avoid using these mugs most all the time (we don't drink beer out of them, just milk and soda, so perhaps there's some benefit when using these for beer).Because of this design attribute, I'm actually looking to get rid of these mugs."
3,not for dishwasher,"All the praises by other reviewers are fair and accurate. I am surprised though that no one pointed out that it is not practical to wash it in a dishwasher because dirty dishwater accumulates in the bottom of it when turned upside down (it is concave from both ends if you know what I mean). I wonder if this problem would be eliminated if I placed it horizontally into the dishwasher. Has anyone tried that? Another option is to drill a hole into the bottom of it after drinking from it and right before placing it into the dishwasher. Yes, that would be a perfect solution. After washing it just use a cork or chewing gum (or equivalent) to plug the hole. I think I am gonna patent this."
1,Not very durable...,"I ordered these mugs for my brother for Christmas. I received the first set and one had a broken handle, despite the great lengths Amazon went to to protect them in shipping. The second set I received had a mug shattered and another one broken. Luckily between the two sets, I can piece together a complete set. If it wasn't so close to Christmas I would try to find some mugs elsewhere."
5,No complaints at all,"I freeze these mugs, but it's probably more for looks than anything, as it looks really cool frosted when you get them out of the freezer, but I'm not sure how much colder they make my drinks, and the frozen look goes away pretty soon, even when putting refrigerated drinks in there with ice cubes.But even if you don't freeze them, these are high quality mugs that kids enjoy with their root beer floats, and just holding them makes you feel like you're in Bavaria with something stronger poured in them.Want some mugs? Get these. For the price, I can't imagine there is something out there that is better."
4,Great but would handwash,"I have these in the freezer waiting for a cold beer. I would give them 5 stars except that when you place them in the dishwasher, the concave bottom collects water making it necessary to hand dry them."
4,Solid Product-Limited Capacity,"These mugs are dissapointing only in their capacity. They are functional and heavy and stable and I am currently using them, but find that I have to return to the kitchen for a refill (iced tea) about twice as many times as before my larger mug was broken. One mug was shattered in transit, too."
5,lovely. thick glass and has weight to them,"i was looking for a pub quality beer mug set.These are very nice. thick glass. and heavy. also great for frosted mugs, wet and put in the freezer for a bit.i was a lil nervous about receiving glass in the mail, but it was packed appropriately and was a brand new box, not an open box/return item.have plans to try these mugs for root beer floats."
5,great,"Very heavy and solid, perfect size to hold a beer. Love keeping these in the freezer for a frosty beer any time."
3,One out of four arrived chipped,"Not returning since I didn't inspect them carefully enough when I unpacked them. I threw away the packaging when I put the four mugs lip-down in my freezer so I could have frosty mugs with my beer. The first one I pulled out of the freezer had a small chip in the lip. The other three look OK so far. It's possible it arrived chipped, also possible it chipped when I put it in the freezer, the world will never know."
4,Very good mugs with a couple small flaws,"As many other reviewers have said, these are nice solid mugs that are almost perfect. The two problems are: 1) Large recesses on the bottom that catch about three tablespoons of water when run through the dishwasher and, 2) A molding seam that runs around the mug and even down the inside of the handle. The seam is large and sharp enough to be painful when holding the mug for an extended time. I'll probably find some way to take the edge off the seam on the inside of the handle, but that shouldn't be necessary, it should have been taken care of by the manufacturer."
5,"Solid, as is",solid glasses. looks just like the photo. will order more when i have one too many and drop them. packaging was very good and glasses arrived not broken. thank you
4,Nice beer mugs,I ordered these glasses for my home bar and I liked what I see. These glasses are nice and solid. Good product for the price.
5,hefty glass,"Hefty weight to this glass, very impressed with the heavy weight and size. They are really a Man's mug for beer but, you can Freeze it up for any drink. Only disappointment was shipping cost. Otherwise a great heavy glass."
5,exactly what I was hoping for,"the dvd wasn't scratched, was in perfect condition/good as new, was shipped to me on time (in fact a day early I believe), and love these movies! old classics! I recommend buying these movies."
2,2 Chick Flicks that Fall Flat,"UGH - I don't really get why people think Julia Roberts is so great at Chick Flicks. This movie is awful - her character is mean spirited and selfish. She is not at all sympathetic so when she loses (as she should) I felt vidicated. The best part of this movie was Cameron Diaz who just let it all hang out there and didn't care how foolish she looked.On to the Wedding Planner. At lease J Lo is somewhat sympathetic, but again, she is not great in these movies. She is a only a sub par actress and I don't quite get her appeal. This movie is lacking in any real chemistry, but it's cute at the very best.For a really good Chick Flick, try Bridget Jones' Diary or An Affair to Remember with Cary Grant. You will see what chemistry, good casting, good acting and sympathetic characters look like."
5,Outstanding Nutcracker,The picture didn't do this nutcrack justice. It is better than I had hoped. This is a mini Steinbach and it holds true to the Steinback quality and wonderful detail. This piece will thrill any collector or lover of nutcrackers.
4,A whole different ballgame...,"I waited for this bruh's album with great anticipation for quite some time. When I first played it, I realized I was expecting ""Instant Vintage II."" That was a mistake, because Saadiq's track record clearly shows that the ONLY thing predictable about his music is that it will be QUALITY.The ""blaxploitation"" theme is not a new one, even for Saadiq, but I can tolerate it for one album. The straight funk/soul grooves are a welcome respite from the everyday BS on radio and videos.If you EVER get a chance to see this cat live, do it! This CD will made a solid entry to your Saadiq/TTT collection (PS: CHECK OUT TEEDRA MOSES -- BANGIN'!)..."
3,Nice,There were some songs that I just couldn't get into like the shotgun joint. I didn't feel that one at all. But it's nice and I wish him Luck on this album.
3,"A let-down after his ""Instant Vintage"" masterpiece","Perhaps, I expected too much from the singer after his superb ""Instant Vintage"" but ""Ray Ray"" left me longing. The concept of an album based on a ""70's Mack Daddy"" was a winner; it's just that the songs on this disc don't live up to the premise. I can only recommend this album for those fans of his, like myself, that gobble up anything with his name on it.A real thorn in the side is the constant repetition of the singer's name, as well as his ""alter ego's."" This wears thin after about the third time.Saadiq has the skills to be a modern day Marvin Gaye and I'm sure that in time that day will come.He just didn't hit the mark with this average release."
1,Terrible...,"I'm so disappointed in this cd. The beats are wack, the lyrics are elementary, and who the hell said it would be a good idea to have gunshots on an R&B song? This is a bootlegger's dream...but then they may not even be able to sell this terrible cd. Out of fourteen songs, the only good one was ""I want you back"". Ugh."
2,This was as painful for me 2 write as it will be 4 U 2 read!,"I'm a pretty big Raphael Saadiq fan. I'm from Oakland and grew up listening to Tony Toni Tone & I LOVED Instant Vintage, which is why Ray Ray is such a disappointment. The majority of the songs remind me of the Lucy Pearl and 3T songs that I DIDN'T like. I was anticipating more cuts like Instant Vintage's ""Skyy, Can You Feel Me"" but they were nowhere to be found. Saadiq defintely enjoyed creating the album which I appreciate, but I had difficulty following the theme(s) (something to do with a pimp and the death of that dreaded label ""Neo Soul""). I was searching for music that I could enjoy a good book, conversation, or cup of tea to, but needless to say, these songs just weren't there. I hate to confine him to comparisons of his past work, but Instant Vintage was just that-Instant Vintage. Ray Ray is...well, Ray Ray."
2,Hit&Alot of Miss,Raphael Saadiq is a Very Talented Brother no doubt. I enjoy hearing Him Grooving on the Bass&Also His Production.also like the strings He has in His work. that is all the Hit. now the mIss: His Vocal Instrument just doesn't have that pop to it. he ain't that much in the songwriting department on a whole&He still to Me is Better suited in a Band Enviroment.this Cat has been around since the Mid to late 80's.I dig His Bass runs on here&also some of the Production but IMO He should do a Quincy Jones or Dr.Dre type of Project where he has more outside folks singing His Stuff. let Him get someone like El Debarge or Tevin Campbell singing some of these cuts&they are enhanced ten fold.
3,Dean Starter Bass Pack,"I bought this guitar for my son as a gift. The overall product is a good starter for those learning to play. However, the color I ordered was not the color he received."
1,Dont buy this...,"This package is great in some way, but TERRIBLE in others.Good:-Slim neck (great for starting musicians)-decent sound from pickup-simple controlsBad:-the amp is small-the amp distorts easily-the amp's jack broke and it cuts out. i had to get a new one-the guitars jack gets loose, and because each time i have to remove the jack to fix it, the wood stripped and the jack is flopping offOverall i like the guitar, but the jacks are garbage. ive only owned this for about 4 months, and ive replced my amp and im considering replacing the guitar. I practically broke it trying to get the jack back on, i had to use massive screws. i wouldnt have had that problem if the jack didnt continuously get loose anyway"
1,Very disappointing,"When the bass arrived, the package was beat up and the amp was missing. When we called to return it, they said it would take 1 to 3 months to replace it. Ridiculous."
3,So-So Lifting Gloves,"They don't ""give"" very well, no flexibility, so with some exercises I just take them off entirely. I thought the leather gloves would be better and stronger but the leather rubs against the hand sometimes and causes blisters too. For the most part though, they will protect your hands while using weights and get the job reasonably done."
3,comfortable,"The gloves have a nice amount of cushioning and are comfortable. However, after only one use the stitching at the thumb area has already come undone, on one of the gloves."
1,disappointed,I was very upset when I recieved this item bcuz it was not the item in the photo but it was another instead .... false advertisment...........not happy
4,Sugar Free Walnut Brownies,"For a sugar-free product they were very tasty. The price wasn't bad on the cookies either, but the price to ship them was not worth buying them again."
2,Okay cookies...,These cookies had very little flavor. I do like the fact that they are sugar-free and low in calories though. But in this case the trade off wasn't worth sacrificing flavor.
2,Not the best...,"This powder leaves tastes terrible and leaves an obvious metallic aftertaste and does not mix in to liquid very well, a lot of it settles on the bottom of the glass. I've used other/better brands of vitamin C powder, and just thought I'd try something new, but I obviously won't be buying this product again. That being said, we used it to get through a couple of colds and it seemed to be at least as effective as the other powders I've tried."
3,This could be a lie...,"This could be a lie, but I found this book to be fairly interesting, yet poorly written. The author sometimes writes his opinions as if they are blunt facts. I enjoyed the bits of information on animal behaviour, but again poorly written. There is a lot here to make a more interesting read out of. I really felt sometimes as if I was reading a high school student's extended essay. He did his research, he had some interesting things to think about, he put it together and got a B+ (for a high school student).This book really has potential. I'd say pull it from the shelves, rewrite it, then resell it. More money for the author and publishers, more fun for more readers.Regardless, it's a book to be taken with a grain of salt. Enjoy the stories, disregard the opinions."
3,Good for their price,"The volume on the speakers is very 'fussy.' You have to find a perfect balance between your source volume (ie a computer) and the speakers volume. The speakers tend to slowly fall out of the base stand, but not too big of a deal. The quality of the sound is pretty good (again considering the price). These would not be good for playing music at a small party, the quality diminished greatly when the volume is turned up.All in all, it was worth the purchase. Cheap, decent quality, nice little carrying case, and you can lay them in a horizontal position too."
1,"Silly, pretentious, and without a cohesive thesis","I did not find this book entertaining or informative. It appears to be a general survey work, lacking in testable theories, and largely the result of data mining. Terms are loosely defined, and the ""Scientific"" portions of the data are laughable. One chart claims to represent ""Political affiliation of residents who have primitive art, by their attitude to the art"" and, remarkably, people have only two attitudes at all - co-equal with western art, or ""disrepect or in Darwinian terms"" Even better, the total who view with ""disrespect"" was 15 people. Quite the illustrative survey. The sort of garbage that gives all liberal arts a bad name."
1,too brief,This encyclopedia is too brief and useless to provide any important information. It really has no content and just go to the library to get the real information.
2,Poor Movie,I am a huge Sarah Jessica Parker fan but this was not a good movie at all. Totally sucked. She was not in it much at all.
3,Desciption,"Desciption:It's based on a novel. It's about the life of a lonely and isolated woman who is transformed when she opens herself up to the outside world and to a gentle, romantic relationship."
3,just ok.,"I normally wear a 9.5. I ordered a 10, hoping to leave room for winter socks. The 10 was too small - my toes were pressed to the end of the boot. It cost me $10 UPS to return. I wasn't charged for replacement shipping, and I exchanged for the 10.5, which barely fit with normal socks (still a bit short). I have never worn a 10.5 in my life.They are just ok looking - really lumpy around the insole and arch. They seem pretty warm, and they are as lightweight as I'd hoped. Craftsmanship is not great, but then for the price what can you really expect.Overall, somewhat disappointed, but I'm giving em a try in this, my first Chicago winter."
5,Nixon,This book was obviously well researched. It certainly shed new light on the Nixon persona that I did not know existed. The 3 Nixon volumes should be required reading in history classes.
2,Undependable,"For a point and shoot camera, I expect this thing to take decent pictures consistently. It doesn't.I bought it for my girlfriend just over a year ago, and I still feel a little embarassed. Most of out pictures are taken at night, and indoors. To get a decent picture of a face or person I usually have to try almost every setting.... Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Portrait, Soft Light... then Flash Auto, Flash Off, Flash On, etc.By the time I get a good picture, I've lost the moment and have to delete 6 or 7 all black or all white pictures plus some blurry ones. There are times when I take 4 or 5 pictures from the exact same place and the come out totally different, too black, too white, red or weird blurry.I use my Nikon D40x for quality pictures and end up using my phone for candid shots instead of dragging this Sony arround."
5,Wow extra life for phone,Love this battery!!! I go all day gaming and online!!!! Price was excellent received the battery fast. I recommend anyone whoo has this phone to get
2,Not the Best Little Cookie,I ordered this cookie and It's not very good at all to me!!! will not order again!!! At least not Fat Free
2,Too Damn Big,"Alright, so I have a Laptop with a 15.6"" screen and if you include the bezel,it is 16"" altogether. The item description states that it could fit 15.4"" laptops. Heh, no! I place my laptop over it and I think, it's too small for my laptop. Nope, I place my laptop inside the bag and zip it up and there is this large pocket of air around the top and sides of the laptop. If you don't want your laptop sliding around in the bag and actually want to keep it safe, don't purchase this bag. I requested for a return, and soon it was authorized. So I'm all happy, ready to return this item. But Wait! The seller makes you pay for return postage. I bought this for about $5 with $5 shipping. If I pay $5 to ship it back, and they give me my $5 back, then I'm basically sending in the bag with a loss of $5. That means I won't have the bag or the money I paid for it. It's like I'm paying to get rid of it!. Forget that! I'd rather keep it and give it to someone who could use it."
5,Totally love this movie,"This movie was a huge hit in our home. We have a 2 1/2 year old daughter and she just can't get enough of anything princess related. She loves to get dressed up and dance and sing with the characters in the movie. I would not ordinarily have been okay with Barbie, but this movie is very tasteful and shows the independence and strength that the women characters possess."
5,Barbie movies are the best,"I enjoyed this movie and all the Barbie flicks. I look forward to all the new ones coming out. Rapuzel blows doors, I just can't say enough good about Barbie Movies...I'm an adult and I love them also."
5,My daughter LOVES this move....and so does my son!,I bought this Barbie moved based upon my daughter's love for Barbie and the reviews on Amazon stating this was more than just a Barbie movie. The singing and story line are wonderful! My 4 year old daughter and even my 6 year old son love this. I would say this movie gives all the teen shows out there a HUGE run for their money in the signing department. My daughter knows all the songs and is mesmerized by this movie. Would absolutely purchase again.
5,BEST EVER!,"This is great!!!!! If you have a look at the little clip above you will see how wonderful it is,the music,well....is soo good!!Actually that clip is my favourite, the girls sing about theirlife-styles, the people who do their voices are great singers.I give 5 STARS for this, it is my favourite dvd ever and watch it at least twice a day!!!Thats how good it is!!!Im actually 11 and have started liking barbies again,I think younger children will find some of the words confusing but this is still an exciting dvd and im sure everyone will enjoy it.P.S if you like the dvd you should definatley think about buying the dolls(i watched it and now am getting all the stuff for x-mas,ooh i cant wait!!)"
5,VERY GOOD MOVIE,ALL GIRLS WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE AND THEY LIKE TO SING WITH IT AND ACT OUT WITH THE MOVIE ALSO. SO CUTE
5,Great movie for all,"I first rented this movie and my daughter insisted on watching it over and over again, so we bought it for her birthday. She couldn't have been happier. The movie has a great story and wonderful songs to go along with it. It has the kids dancing and singing everytime it is on. I would recommend this movie to anyone with kids."
2,Why the coarse language?,"Our daughter loves Barbie movies and this one is as good as previous ones in terms of the story, music and characters. My only issue with it is that it seems the writers made a decision to coarsen the language somewhat. I heard too many words in this film that I would not allow my children to use. I assume that the writers are hoping words like ""stupid"" and ""idiot"" will appeal to older children but if more parents like me are paying attention, that may backfire. Sadly, we have purchased our last Barbie movie."
3,tramps,i have been watching this movie with my neice and have noticed that the princess only changes her dress on her wedding day and the queen never changes her dress even on her wedding day even in the pictures of the princess she is wearing the same dress the pauper wears more dreses than the princess and queen and she only has one dress
5,you'll be singing the songs for days,this is my favorite of all the barbie movies. my girls (and I) sing the songs all day long. the cd included was a surprizing bonus.
4,"It's cute, but it's too hard to understand for young girls","My daughter wanted this so badly for her 4th birthday. We have two of the other Barbie movies and we liked those. This one was cute - for me. But my daughter truly could not follow the story. As someone else said, the dialogue and explanations are often tucked into songs. And my daughter was really confused when Erika went to live in the castle and wore the wig. She couldn't understand where Erika had ""gone."" The dolls are gorgeous - we bought one of those. We too, love Kelly dolls, and were saddened when they weren't really part of the movie. My daughter kept asking ""where are the children, mom?"" She meant the Kellies. Still glad we bought it, but I hope Fairytopia (evidently, the next movie) will be easier for small girls to understand."
4,Loved it!,This movie was very close to being my favorite barbie movie! i loved the singing and i always sung along to it i like all the songs except preminger's and to be a princess but still its a very entertaining even for adults and im sure you will like it to! so get the movie and see for yourself.BarbieLover
5,Movie Review,My daughter is 3 1/2 and loves all things Disney Princess and Barbie. She really likes musicals and this is her new favorite. It's a cute story line and it comes with the music CD. She loves to play the music and dance around singing the songs.
5,I agree-- a big hit with my three-year-old.,"What everyone else said is true-- I'm a dad who actually found this little movie very enjoyable, but more to the point, my daughter just goes bonkers over it. It's sweet and innocent and the songs are catchy in a faux Broadway style. If you need pop cultutural referencing and self-aware kid fare, this is not that. But my daughter found it enchanting-- and just like the others said, she wants to listen to the CD every night."
5,Great Movie!,"The movie was really good. I think you shouldn't put age limits on the movie like, (3-9 years). I am sixteen and I loved the movie! The characters has vivid personalites and it was definetly a success. Infact I was more excited about the movie comming out than ne two little sisters.(Ages 7 and 10). Erika's voice was quite beautiful ,but Annaleise's voice was awful. She needs to get a privite voice trainer. (Belive me I know. I was in a broadway show.)I'm not kidding. That is what I think about the movie THE PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER."
4,Granddaughter loves Barbie!,"Our four-and a half year-old granddaughter loves all of the Barbie movies! I purchased 6 movies for summer viewing and we have watched them all multiple times. We don't always get through an entire movie in one sitting, but the story lines, music, and lessons seem appropriate for her age. Cute characters and always a happy ending!"
4,Surprisingly fantastic,"I can't believe I'm saying this about a Barbie movie but it was actually pretty good. Of course, the story line is cheesy and predictable, HOWEVER the music is pretty good. Usually, I hate musicals. This one though I actually didn't shut off. Though I'm a teenager and I haven't seen this movie in about 8 years I enjoyed it. I'm sure other teenagers and adults can appreciate this movie as I did."
4,Clear Reading of Literal Translation,"The NASB is a literal translation, which strives for word-for-word correspondence to the underlying words in the original. This is excellent for serious, thougthful study, because such ""transparency"" helps the lister know that the translation is not filtered through the translators' understanding and interpretation of the text.Concerning Steven B. Stevens reading of the text, it is clear and distinct, which is important for the listener to pay attention. Monotone readings can ""run together"" so it is hard to recall and retain the reading. However, I know some think his reading is somewhat overwrought and stilted, like the broadcaster Ted Baxter from the old Mary Tyler Moore show. Yet, I have grown accustomed to his voice and like it.Frank Walton[...]"
2,Not written for passengers,"The title is misleading; it says it's for the flying public, which most would associate with passengers, yet it's actually for crewmembers. The print is large, and so are the white spaces. Lots of poor quality photos of defensive tactics.I am a flight attendant for a major airline who underwent revised hijacking security training after 9/11. Pictures are not sufficient. You have to have someone to practice with if you're interested in the physical aspect of the book (via the pictures).The book has some good information for those of you who are not crewmembers, but I wouldn't pay $15.95 for it."
1,Garbage techniques,"This is one of worst books on self defense that I have ever read. Now I know that anything can get published. Anyone with even half decent Judo or jiu-jitsu or just a pissed off dude would be able to destroy anyone trying this garbage. After you pinch their lips or try the knee strike to the thigh, get ready for the real attack. All you will have done is irritate the guy. BOHICA!Not one effective strangle in the whole book. Nothing on restraining a hijacker after they have been neutralized. At least show how to use a neck tie or a scarf to secure their hands after they have been rendered unconscious. Only problem is this book doesn't have any techniques that would put someone out.Your better off with nothing. All this book does is going to do is give you a false sense of confidence."
5,A MUST HAVE BOOK FOR EVERYONE THAT FLIES! OUTSTANDING!,"After reading the superb New York Times article in the business section on page C7 this morning, we purchased the book. We were very impressed with the backgrounds of the authors and further impressed with the book's content. The instructional step-by-step pictures are great! The self-defense tactics performed throughout the book should be easy to grasp for everyone. This is a book everyone should read and constantly refer to as needed on a day-to-day basis!"
2,Coffee & Kung Fu,"Light read, the main character can really get on your nerves, she just needs to get over herself."
2,bitter coffee,"truly i didnt like it. it was a great first try, but the inconsitency bothered me as well as the fact that i couldnt connect with the main character. maybe its just not for me"
2,I didn't really like it,"I thought that the writing style was ok, but the characters just didn't seem very real to me. Especially the main character -- I couldn't connect with her. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,It's a Serial Cable,"It's pretty hard to get this one wrong. But it seems there's always room for improvement. The connectors are solid but entirely plastic; I prefer the ones that have the metal screws. The ""beige"" is more of a light grey. And my biggest complaint was that the cable was taped into a coil. First, the tape always leaves a residue which is sticky and collects dust eventually turning black. Second, you have to use a knife or scissors to cut the tape which always runs the risk of slicing the cable. For these reasons, most cables sold today are coiled with twist-ties. I wish I could rate the packaging separately from the product (product = 4 stars; packaging = 2 stars)."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book reads like a brainstorming session gone wild. It gives you little snippets of businesses, some of which are standard, a few are creative and some are just page-filling nonsense no one would ever build a business on. You'd be better off just making a list of everything you like to do and trying to build a business around that list."
3,Good for new ideas and old,"I bought this book, because I am a guy that seems to not like regular jobs. I had a one day delivery job, a weekend band job, yet I wanted more ideas, seeing as I was spending a lot of time online, and I figured this book would help me to make more money. I was expecting some advice on how to start a publishing venture. What I got was more...much more. The book is divided into categories which is great. I happened to be in the entertainment field, as well as the teaching field. It gave me two great ideas for new jobs, as well as expanding on the jobs I already did. For example, I had always been into music and comedy. It suggested a songwriting business. I am also a teacher, this book suggested I look into learning theory and motivation skills. I talked with my Mom, and mentioned that with her sewing skills, she could open a custom curtain biz, as she had made curtains for me in the past.."
2,"Montana, a very weird state","Every book I've ever read in which Montana was a character has been a big disappointment. I read this one only because my sister sent it to me in a box of her used books.The writing wasn't bad, but I didn't like any of the characters, I didn't like the plot, and I didn't like either of the settings.What is with these people who want to live outside the laws that as citizens the rest of us have agreed to abide by? I think they're a bunch of hypocrites. They refuse to pay income taxes, but they don't mind buying gasoline for their gas-guzzlers and paying tax on it. As usual with such groups, the leader turns out to be a nut case."
4,Gripping Story of Family Ties and Obligations,This is a compelling story of the pain and regret one can have by trying to fulfull the obligations placed upon us by family responsibilities. It also gives great insight into the militia movement in America. The author does a tremendous job of explaining the sacrifice and alienation that can occur by trying to live up to other people's expectations and not following our own feelings. I greatly enjoyed this book and will read others by this author.
2,Disappointing.,"Was this really written by the same person who wrote Kentucky Straight and The Same River Twice? Those books are fantastic. This one was filled with lackluster writing, cliches, and two- dimensional ""scary"" characters in Montana. Oooh, those anti-government types are nuts. Tell me something I didn't know."
3,Morality play,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found this book to be a united whole. The two locales are meant to contrast and draw out the character of the protagonist, Virgil Caudill. The book is character-driven, although there are a few scenes of tension. The key question Virgil must answer is ""Who am I?"" The moral themes in the book are a bit ambiguous. While the book is infused with a moral dimension, very little time is spent in moral reflection. Guilt exists, to an extent, and it haunts Virgil, to an extant, but here most of I all I feel the book falls short in exploring the consequences to the soul of Virgil's actions. Please note that the language and the description of a sexual encounter between a man and a dog would not make this book appropriate for high school libraries."
3,Academic Overview,"This is an excellent survey of portrait art from ancient to modern times with a great bibliography, lots of references, and good illustrations. I appreciated the historic timeline and a list of websites for further research.I'd recommend this book for anyone interested in portraiture. As a portrait artist I thoroughly enjoyed it. For some reason, art historians have largely ignored portraiture as a field of research.My only criticism is that I found the book a bit dry, lacking creative insight and humor. The emphasis on painting, at the expense of drawing and sculpture is also a notable shortcoming."
2,"Interesting, but No Great Insights","This is an interesting review of the complexitie of portraiture. The book is well-structured and researched, with very good illustrations. It is irritating that the captions repeat much of what is already in the text, but omit to mention where the paintings are held. However, my biggest reservation about the book is the almost total absence of fresh insights or interesting perspectives. The author seems more concerned with mentioning all the various academic points of view than providing her own thoughts. Pity."
4,History of portraiture,This is a better written essay than the plates which are not always true color rendition. I would have like more plates.
4,"well written, funny and fun",I don't think that I can add much except to say that this is a comfort book of mine when I'm in the mood for light humor. Very well done for what it is.
4,One of my most frequently re-read books,"So it's not great literature; frankly most of the time I'd rather read this. There aren't many books out there that make me laugh as hard as this one does. If you don't like puns however, stay far, far away. The world is a well thought out ""modern"" world of magic, with Turtledove showing a good understanding of how technology (or in this case magic) advances layer one upon another to produce larger scale changes.A must for anyone lost in the bowels of government beauracracy."
2,"Cute, light reading","This is not one of those tales that's compelling enough to keep you up at night, but it's worth finishing. Full of humor and lots of really lame puns, you might get a chuckle or two out of it."
2,Quite weak for Turtledove,"I'm rather a fan of Turtledove's work, but this one left me mostly annoyed. The conceit is amusing, but the meticulous attention to detail that Turtledove uses so well in his alternate histories serves him poorly here. The inside jokes about LA, in particular the San Fernando Valley, are fun; and the mechanics of the world are well thought out -- but the result is somehow tedious; I found myself turning pages to get the punch line, rather than savoring each page as I did with (for example) his Civil War books.I'm disappointed. It sure won't stop me from scooping up other Turtledove books, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone either."
1,Not for me,This product just didn't work for me. I'm really sensitive to caffeine and this just didn't do anything. If you want to try Cha de Bugre try a product with a higher concentration.
4,"Charity and Kindness by All, and for All","This is a very short heartwarming story about the importance of charity and simple kindness, particularly to the less fortunate among us. It takes very little of your time to read, and it is well worth the few moments' investment. I think that it would warm the heart even of pre-visitation Ebenezer.While the story is based upon or inspired by The Gospel of St. Matthew, Chapter 25, I recommend it to people of all faiths and even to those who reject a supernatural being, for it is a lesson in common decency and the moral is for all."
3,Compelling.,In reading this story I felt like I was the old cobbler. I was compelled to continue reading. I enjoyed it very much. I want to read more of Leo Tolstoy's work.
1,If you have the 80GB iPod don't buy this product.,"Seriously, take the $10 bucks that this would cost you (with shipping) and wrap it around your iPod. It will provide better protection. I have the 80GB iPod and this case does not fit properly, but even if it did the only thing that this ""case"" would provide protection against is a breeze, maybe."
3,Needs More Thought!!,"This is a good review of the history of the Israeli-Palestinian issue. It addresses the problem from both sides, and from the side of the Arab world also. Some of his assertions are particularly interesting, including the apparent fact that there were no Palestinians before Israel became a possibility after the Balfour declaration . . . until then these people were just Arabs. His solutions to the problem left something to be desired. Essentially he says that there is no solution to the conflict, and presents measures which are contradictory to one of his theses. He notes that when push comes to shove, a population will favor social issues over economic ones, however his solutions are basically economic solutions. He should have given the same level of thought to solutions to this problem as he did to the origins of the problem between the Israelis and the Palestinians."
1,Exceptionally disapointing,"Raphael and the exceptional artists that sing with him are the best of the best in the music universe, but the DVD Raphael: 50 Anos Despues is the worst I have seen. Raphael starts giving thanks to his fans for following his artistic career and proceeds to sing along some of the best singers in the Latin world and even Paul Anka. Then when the fisrt song starts you are really enjoying the performance when it gets interrupted by the singer and you have to listen to this mini-interview about how wonderful Raphael is. Then the song continues and the next singer does the same. The DVD does not allow you to see the performance without interruption. It is a really bad DVD, listen to me and don't waste your money."
5,Behind Every Door,I love this band. my fiancee went to highschool with Bryce Fraizer. he is one of the vocalists for this band. the rock so hard. if you get this CD they will sign it at any concert check them out www.neverset.com thier new cd is titled behind every door
1,Plagiarism,"I write only about work done by my firm for AT&T that Mr. Boar has published without our permission or attribution. I personally handed him a copy of some of the pages in this book after he represented himself as an AT&T employee and asked ""May I have a copy?"" He never disclosed his alternate employment as an author or asked permission to publish our work. He may have done so without full disclosure to AT&T, his employer at the time."
2,Rubbish,"I like a good true crime story, but I like it to be accurate and intelligent. This book is slush written to titillate, focusing on the sex lives of the female protagonists and recreating cliche-filled conversations and internal thoughts the author could not possibly have known about. As an Australian, I am aware that the Vampire case included is riddled with inaccuracy. Reads like the trashiest British tabloid.Most repellent, in the chapter about the mother who struck back, Clarkson appears to blame the ""flirtatious"" nature of a young child for leading to sexual abuse against her.Clumsy, sensationalistic nonsense written for people who couldn't care less about actual fact or good writing and want something semi-pornographic - the murderess as a nymphomaniac lesbian sex-goddess deviant slut etc. Most of the stories lost me halfway through.It gets two stars for being only mildly interesting; it could have been so much more. Read Ann Rule instead."
2,Works Well for a while,I have bought 2 of these and they only lasted a season each..MAX.. Just cheap cheap components..Sadly I will not buy this again!
2,Does not work while plugged in,I agree with the other post. This thing only works when it is not plugged in and that has burned me several times. It came with my ski tube and I cannot use the tube unless I charge this stupid thin on my way to the water and even then it barely lasts through pumping up the tube. Do no buy this product unless you only want to use it off the rechargeable battery.
3,AN ACQUIRED TASTE,"I tried to get into the music of Timothy Wright. But, it just don't work for me. I'll give it 3 stars for effort, but that's the best I can do. Nothing really jumped up and grabbed me."
5,Da Bomb!,"I think this song is great, no matter what version! It was great fom the beginning. Keep it up!"
4,Scared the begebes out of me!,"My sister called me last night and asked me ""What is the scariest book you ever read as a kid?"" Didn't take me more than 1/2 a second to say 'Christina's Ghost'. I finished this book and promptly crawled into bed with my sister! The next day I gave her the book and told her she had to read it! Yeah, she crawled into my bed about a week later.Can't remember how old I was when I first read this book, but I am 32 right now! This book started me on my long line of horror novels and I will never forget the first time I had to sleep with the light on! The only other novel that had me do that was 'Salems Lot'!"
4,A Good Ghost Story for Beginners,"This is an excellent first ghost story for readers 10 and up. Christina finds herself having to spend some time with her uncle, whom she barely knows, and she sets about entertaining herself. She soon realizes that she and her uncle are not the only ones in the cabin and she is determined to find out what is going on.There are several suspenseful and on the edge of your seat scenes but not so over the top that it is too much."
3,Christina's Ghost,"My story's main events was that a girl named Christina and her sister are supposed to go to their grandmother's house, but their grandma is at the hospital.The two girls are sepperated for the summer at least until their grandma is in the hospital. Christina has to stay at this old ,creepy, haunted house with her grumpy uncle. The problem is she sees a ghost. she saw a closed door and it looked like a little boys room and to go along with the room she sees a ghost boy who lives in that room. She figures everything out by going to a news paper store mext to the library her uncle was at. Christina asked a guy for old newspaper and on the front page it said the little boy that was in room was murdered along with his dad."
4,Very Good Diaper Bag,"Nice colors, very light. One thing to improve: the lateral pocket (there aren't useful)."
4,behind the scenes of new and contemporary art and artmaking,"Weintraub has done the footwork here--for a lot of people that would read her book. She demonstrates her curious mind and is able to convert that into a series of reviews of what is out there right now--and makes it into a very hip series of essays--one you would think is stodgy at first, but is actually very informative, and demonstrates her knowledge and skill by getting into these artists minds and the what and why that goes into ther work. It's a wonderful text book, but even if I didn't use it as a text, I could seriously put it down and feel satiated--like I had learned something new. I would recommend the book to artist and sudent alike, and if I were teaching a class, I would seriously consider using it. All in all, a very good book."
2,refund?,"Hi, I returned this book almost 3 weeks ago and haven't recieved a refund yet? Could you please elxplain why and get back to my emails?Thank you"
4,Mexican couple,This is the debut album of Mexican couple Rodrigo y Gabriella.They are accomplished acoustic guitar players and really explode in this album.They have been residing in Ireland for 5 years now.Their second album is a live perfromance album.Unfortunately it is not available on amazon at the moment.On this one they explain their trash metal roots in Mexico and of Metallica and other bands like slayer and megadeth`s influence on them.Don`t get me wrong their music is very latin american sounding and their guitar playing is incredible.I saw them play live in Limerick and they were breath taking.I would highly recommend this debut to anyone.Also look out for their second album Live in Manchester and Dublin which features 2 live versions of Metallica ONE and clips of the white stripes thrown in for good measure.But on this album all music is written by them.
5,Awesome,"Awesome classical guitar music. Heard it first in ""Sprouts"" in S. Lake Tahoe, CA. Blended in very nicely with this bistro atmosphere."
1,not secure,"Hello,I own the case for the 60 GB.The case is not covered at the botton, so it scratches with normal use.It does not have a protection for the wheel button.It pops open if it falls (happened once and the screen got scratched)I am getting a silicone"
5,Stunning. Spectacular. Breath-Taking. Extreme.,"SOUTH WITH ENDURANCE is the official photographic record of the extraordinary expedition to the Antarctic in 1914 under Sir Ernest Shackleton. Frank Hurley was hand-picked to photograph and record the discovery of the South Pole and to chronicle the brave works of the intrepid explorers and events of the mission.Having read the accounts of the ENDURANCE expedition, I couldn't wait to see the pictures...of the ice, the beauty, the men, dogs, ship, of the hardships and victories of this ill-fated expedition. I was not disappointed.This collection of photographs is breath-taking, beautiful, and spectacular. At a time when the science of photography was in its early stages, Hurley captured hundreds of images which became the official record and bore witness to the heroism and extreme conditions which threatened the lives of the 28 explorers."
1,Item not as described.,"After reading the description of this item I thought I was buying a dozen votive holders. To my surprise, and $6.00 in shipping, I received only 1 votive holder. The glass has bubbles in it and it looks very cheap. I was ripped off."
5,My tail is still wagging,The dvd is very comprehenshive. I found new methods of training my Jack Russell Terriers that works. I found it helpful to have a visual of the training techniques. The editing of the pieces seemed a little rough but the ladies on the video got their poitn across.
4,Very helpful,"This was easy to use and well laid out. The best message was ""Set your dog up to succeed."" There are no dominance techniques used. The methods worked well with my toy breed except the leash training. I would have to be 3 ft tall to constantly feed treats as I walked. I also wish they had covered some fun commands like fetch."
4,The best training DVD I've seen thus far,"With a new puppy on the way to our home, my family rented five different dog training videos (including ""The Dog Whisperer"" and ""Dog Training the John Fisher Way"") and this was the best of the lot. It has good pacing, the hosts are pleasant and it has enough depth and breadth that it is worth purchasing -- which we did. We have gone back to it as we have progressed and for refreshers on certain commands. Just a good solid DVD."
3,nothing new,"This is a good video for people who choose not to bring their dogs to a school or trainer. I was hoping it would teach more about what to do if your dog isnt perfect like the ones on the video. It teaches a lot of tricks and it gives you the dog's perspective. Overall it was a okay video just wished it would teach more about behaviors that need to be corrected such as: what to do if he barks too much, or does pee in the house, or nips or chases people."
2,Save Your Money,"What a waste of $20. There is about a 3 minute explanation of difficult commands such as heel. And why is it that all the dogs in the video are so much more well behaved than most dogs?? And ""the gentle method"" really just means treat after treat. I want a trained dog not an obese dog."
2,Could have been better,"There was really no continuity to this program. They showed individual commands with one dog at a time. I was really disappointed in the note that ""These dogs have had not previous training""! Rot and Humbug!!!! An untrained dog is not going to focus on the handler like these dogs do. He is going to have his face in the camara lens, sniffing the video guy, or standing behing the owner and barking at the equipment. This is a difficult video for the person who knows nothing about training to use with their house pet. Good section on ""Sit"" and housebreaking when you are gone all day."
1,Nauseating Experience!,This program is a big dissapointment and for me unwatchable. Its unwatchable beause 90% of the time the camera is moving as if filmed on a boat making for an unpleasant viewing experience. I got motion sickness and nausea from this dvd. The material is not well organized and the segment where one of the women walks a doberman is almost impossible to comprehend or follow as to what she is trying to do. Save your money and looks elswhere...
3,"ok, but pretty basic.","this dvd was ok, but i didn't really show too much of anything. each part for training a specific command was pretty short and basic, and didn't give too many pointers, etc."
1,Don't buy it!!,"This is the biggest waste of time I have ever spent money on. The training is very poor, accomplishes nothing. I actually threw it in the trash. A real waste of time, money and effort."
1,Pathetic!,"After reading all the reviews, I was shocked at how pathetic this video actually is. It's awful, anyone can bribe a dog with food, that's not training!"
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This video left much to be desired. The dvd was cheaply made. I urge you NOT to buy this video!! This is $20 thrown out the window. This video was filmed in someones house. I would never buy this if I knew!!!
4,good and basic,"I'm a first time dog owner. I like the short segments demonstrating how to train a dog. It is very basic but helpful. The only thing I was missing was showing more how to train a medium sized dog to walk without pulling. The demonstration to give treats to keep dog attentive to owner by walking was shown on a big dog. It does not work on a small/medium sized dog. You would have to bend way down or the dog has to jump up while walking. I tried it with my dog. That one didn't work. But I tried the other parts: Sit, stay and those are very helpful and can be reviewed whenever needed."
3,"Good training approaches, difficult for user to select lessons","I purchased this video for my mother who was having some behaviour issues with her poodle.We found the lessons to be presented in an easy to follow manner.The problem she had was with how the lessons were presented for selection on the video.A menu of lessons is presented on the screen; as you move the cursor, a dogs paw print highlights the specific lessons. You then hit play or enter to select that lesson.The problem is that it is difficult for her to pick out which lesson is highlighted; particularly if your vision is not quite good, and hers is not.A different method should be used to highlight the lessons. Highlighting the entire lesson frame would have been much better. She eventually gave up trying to use the lessons because she could not navigate to the lesson of interest."
2,Too simplistic,"I agree with the reviewer who asked why all of the dogs in this DVD were so well behaved. I found the DVD much too simplistic. Even the DVD from PetSmart was more helpful to us with our new adopted shelter dog. She is a great dog but very willful. This DVD didn't help at all. Plus, even though I know a lot of trainers use food, I think it creates it's own set of problems. I use food, but this DVD, especially in the leash section, completely focuses on food. I have found other methods more successful and beneficial in my relationship with my new dog."
4,New found confidence for both my dog and myself,"As a first time dog owner I wanted a well behaved, socialized dog. This DVD helped me obtain that. Its organized and clearly explained instructions had me teaching my dog to sit, lay down, and stay in no time at all. Because of the many behaviors we learned on this DVD when we went to obedience classes she was ahead of the pack and moved quickly through the first level.As she learned her new behaviors she became more confident and calm here at home, and I have become more confident knowing I can learn to train my dog successfully, and be a good doggie parent."
4,Good basic instructional,"I really liked this. I combined this with some of the Cesar Millan stuff, and my puppy was trained in no time flat. At 5 months of age he knows come, sit, lay down, stay, heel, shake, drop, and no. He walks really well on the leash, and surprising well off-leash as well. The only thing I will say is the video makes some things look really easy and like the dog learns what they want them to do in about 4-5 attempts. My experience is that it takes a bit longer. Most of the time it will take multiple sessions. But if you keep at it, and do about 15 minutes 2x a day with your dog, it will work!"
1,Skip it,"While not all of it is bad - most of it is incredibly basic without any idea of 'getting there' - dogs showing desired behaviors does not teach.This is very old - frankly better information is available online, even at YouTube.Stick to Dr. Sophi Yin, Pat McConnell, Turid Rugas and The Monks of New Skete - - there are many many better training tools available."
5,Excellent DVD on Dog Training,"If you want to save yourself hundreds of dollars in dog training classes, purchase this DVD and study the material. It contains everything that is taught in two sets of dog training classes. The authors are definitely on the mark on this one. The methods are great!"
5,This Method Really Works,"I ordered this video to work with my very fearful new pound puppy. In just two weeks it's like we have a completely different dog! She now understands ""sit"", and ""down"" and she's working hard on ""stay"". Not only is she becomming a much easier to live with, she's also gaining confidence by leaps and bounds. The tail that was once nearly always tucked now wags almost constantly. I highly recommend this video."
5,THE ANCIENT ISLAMIC SPAIN,"This exquisite CD centers around the Islamic music of the Realm of Valencia,whose capital,the city of VALENCIA(Balansiya in Arabic),was a center of culture and mixture of Muslims,Christians and Jews....VALENCIA today is a thriving Spanish/Mediterranean metropolis.The music dates from the 1100's and has a very distinct feeling from anything else Arabic,since Iberian Arabic is a dead language and the exquisite culture of that Islamic Spain no longer exists.The music is made with both traditional and modern instruments.I am not Muslim but one song is basically a praise to God....Everyone that has heard it has had a very positve reponse.Breathtaking instrumentals and I only wish I could understand it..like with all else,a nice bong hit is recommended ! Has translations........ERIC,NYC"
1,Another purveyor of the 2012 hoax.,"The current Mayan calendar round ends in 2012, and is supposed to bring on some disaster or other. Big deal.The previous Mayan calendar round ended in 3014 BCE, with the appropriate disaster, and the calendar round before that ended about 5000 years earlier -- again with a great disaster. Except for the current calendar round, the Mayans were of course making it all up.The most compelling proof is that there was NO DISASTER in 3014 BCE (or anywhere near that date). Records of the Chinese, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian civilizations are empty of any sort of great disaster in the 31st Century BCE.Give it a break, guys. There is no proof of the silly 2012 claims. Come January 2013, I will be laughing it up at your stupidity."
5,Cables to Go is my place for my cabling needs,This is my third purchase from Cables To Go and each time they have done wonderful. I received quick service and delivery of the exact products I needed. I just ordered another cable yesterday for a monitor extension from C2G and expect it will handle my job perfectly. Thanks Cables To Go!
5,Excellent CD,"The CD was in great shape. It's also just chock full of awesome songs. I was initially drawn by ""angels on the moon"" but i really like all the other songs too."
5,Amazing Band!,"This is an amazing group! The CD is wonderful and very addictive, you'll never want to stop listening!"
5,Interesting new band - Worth a listen!!!,"I kept hearing ""Angels on the Moon"" played on the radio, so I purchased the album. 5 guys in the band (not a female singer!) with some great lyrics and a different sound. Definitely worth a listen!!!"
5,Thriving Ivory CD,"Rec'd in a timely manner. Love, love,love the CD.I've used amazon for reviewing CD's and everything I've rec'd has been in good shape and available.I also purchase books when one intrigues me. Good prices!"
3,Angels On The Moon!,"Dude's voice rocks and ""Angels On the Moon"", IMVHO(in my very humble opinion), is one totally awesome song..CD is cool if not spectacular."
3,My 8 year old loved it...for at least 2 weeks,"My 8-year-old son loved this toy but my son is a ""builder"". He wants to be an inventor when he grows up and will build something from the trash can or from the backyard. We saw this at the Smithsonian and he loved it so I got it for his birthday. He loved it and put it together right away. of course once you put it together the fun doesn't last long. He played with it at least 2 weeks straight -- which at 8 yrs old is pretty darn good. He goes back to it now an again and still enjoys it."
4,snap circuits radio,"Have purchased several of the Snap Circuits products of the past two years. All have been essential to teaching ourchild about the flow of electricity. Our 6 year old may not play with them every day, but they are always used throught the year. We were particularly suprised how much our son loved the radio. Yes its only been a week but a day hasn't gone by where he hasn't listened to it. He loves the fact you can change the station. The fact that he trys to redirect and recreate a new path for the flow, whether its right or wrong is the main reason why we buy these products. We will not hesitate to purchase more of their products in the future.Snap Circuits FM Radio"
2,too simple for kids over 6 years old.,"I bought the large kit of snap circuits for my 10 year old boy as a birthday gift. he enjoyed it for months. I remember when I was the same age, I watched how my uncle put together a simple radio with a single transistor and wire spool around a magnet rod. it worked as I heard the voice through the earphones. so I insisted on buying it for my son. but the FM unit is already packed in one unit ( a tiny white box), so he can't see how it works. after playing with the larger kit, putting the radio together actually bored him. the sound is mediocre. so he never touched it again."
4,"Wonderful, simple project","This is a great product for anyone to build a simple radio and learn about the parts that go into making one work. A group of Cub Scouts purchased this kit as a way to learn about electronics and radios. The best part was that everyone did not have to purchase a kit to have the ability to assemble the project and learn. Once together and working, the kit can be disassembled and reassembled again."
3,Its OK,"Its an ok toy, my 6 yr old daughter and I put it together. Its a bit complicated until you figure out what they mean in the pictures. Daughter likes it and get it out to listen to occasionally. The sound quality is very poor. I think I would have done better just to get her a good quality radio and forget the building part."
1,"Lame, don't even bother","I fail to see how this would teach a kid ANYTHING about radio. It's just a black box FM receiver module. There is nothing on here for the kid to learn about receivers (no tuned circuits, no PLL, nothing). And, as a receiver, it is really of poor quality. Very disappointing especially given the not-so-cheap price."
3,great project,Our son loved putting this together and still has it in his room for his radio. Great learning tool too.
4,Great Christmas Present,Great present for any nerds or geeks any ages all around! The person I gave this toy to is in the army and they absolutely loved it! Thanks again!
3,Review for: SO Much to Tell You,"The first day our class was assigned this book to read I was dreading it. I did not even opened the book, but that night when I read the first few entries I was deeply interested. I didnt even know what to think was going to happen next. This book leaves you in suspension almost the entire book. A horible accidet keeps coming back to her in her dreams. Each time she thinks about it, it hurts her even more. Eventually I realised that the book was actually preety good. Will she ever be normal again? What will happen with her and her Father? Where will she be in three years? These are just some of the question I had and you should ask yourself if you ever read the book."
3,So Much To Tell You,So Much To Tell You is a really good book. It is about a girl who is in boarding school. She doesn't have a lot of friends. And for some reason she doesn't talk to anyone. The book is a journal of what she is going through and how she feels. You can picture your self with her. I thought this book was pretty good.
2,nick's review,"I just got finished reading this book for my english class. The book was a pritty good one, but i couldnt really relate to it, because its about a girl that dosnt talk at all, and if you read it you will find out why. I couldnt relate to it caus i talk alot, but for the most part it was a good book. My english teacher assined this book to my class, and i dont like when teachers do that because if you dont like the book your not going to read it, but im glad he assined this one because it was an ok book, but not what i suspected."
2,So much to tell you,"When we were first assigned to read this book i thought it would be a good book because my English teacher told me it was, but i was wrong. In my opinion was not a good book at all. It was a very boring book which made it seen to never end. At times the book was very dificult to understand and the ending was a very big disapointment. So i would NOT recommend this book to anyone."
4,So Much To Tell You,"While reading So Much To Tell You, I learned a lot fromMarina. She is a girl who had trouble talking because of incindentthat happened with her father. This is a dramatic book on an accident that happened during a young girl's childhood. Her father didn't like her mother so he wanted to spill acid on her face. He mistook his daughter for Marina and spilt the acid on his daughters face. This book was enjoyable but it was kind of boring at times. It is a journal of a girls thoughts on wanting to tell her father some things. She had so much to tell him."
3,Basic Journal Tragedy,"This book was ok. I kinda liked it. It became too basic afterawhile but did have some interesting twists. The plot was not tooinvolved but I liked the ending- it was a nice solution. :) The book or story line itself, in my opinion, was borderline of 'ok read' and 'not even worth reading'. I liked that she used to hurdle hurdles. That one entry actually got my interest ..."
2,So Much To Tell You Review,"I thougth that I would like this book after what my englishteacher said about it. It turned out to be kind of boring, because Icould figure out the ending pretty quickly. One thing that the book did have going for it, was the story of how Marina had her accitednt. This was the only thing that made me kept me reading. The book was still boring over all."
3,Review For: So Much To Tell You,"This book keeps you in suspence until the very end. It's about a girl that has had an unforgetable, tragic past that leaves you trying to figure out what happens until the very end. She is constantly reminded of this heart-racing incident that happened. Does her life ever go back to normal? Will she talk again? Will she forgive and foregt? The riveting suspence of the book will force you to find out the ending to all these questions."
3,Could Have Been Better,"I feel that ""So Much To Tell You"" is a decent book but it could have been better in many ways. It is a compelling story about a young girl, Marina, who has to overcome a huge obstacle in her life. A terrible accident leaves Marina's face disfigured and keeps her from talking to anyone. The only type of communication that she has is through her journal. That is where all of her feelings are written down. So the question is, will Marina ever talk since that horrifying experience? Find out for yourself."
5,Powerful testament of loneliness,"What can a person say after reading a book like this? I identified with Marina so much. I keep a diary,don't talk much either(although more than her),used to be an outcast,and have never felt pretty. However,I'm not disfigured as she was. Now I'm grateful to be average-looking. She couldn't talk after a tragedy scarred her for life,so the journal became her only voice. Despite what he did to Marina,her father was the only relative she loved and wanted to see. She opened up a little to roommates and her English teacher. So much of it is touching and packs an emotional punch,especially the end. The only flaw in the whole book occasional vagueness. To anyone who's ever felt isolated,I give you advice: order this book right now! Mr. Marsden,please write a sequel! We're dying to know what will happen to Marina now!"
2,So Much To Tell You,"My teacher made me read this book like any other teacher would, but in doing this, some books are good, and some books are really bad. This book was not very exciting because the plot took forever to get into, it dragged. The reason I did not like this book is because it was all about a girls journal entries, and i hate reading books that deal with day by day entries. For the most part, some people can relate to the quite girl that Marina was. The ending of the book was the best the best part of the book, so if you want to see what happened at the end order this book now!"
3,So much to tell you,"I did not enjoy this book vey much, I feel it was to dull. In So Much To Tell You, the author should have made the book more exciting. In the begining of the book I really did not wan't to read then towards the middle I didn't want to read even more. Then when it got to the end of the story I liked reading what I had to and a little more some times. Overall i felt the book was o.k, and I would recomend this to adults and children 8th grade and above."
4,So Much to Tell You.....,"This book, So Much to Tell You is a pretty good book. It starts off kind of slow, but as the book goes along, it gets better. It is very relatable. Some of the issues discussed happen all the time. Girls in a boarding school, guy talk, jealousy, divorced parents. Some of the issues in the I was able to relate to. It was written so most people can understand. Overall it was a great book but it was unbelieveable at times during the book. It taught a lot of morals and I learned a lot from the book."
4,Loneliness,"I enjoyed reading this realistic account of a teenage girl struggling to come to terms with her identity, her anger, and her various relationships. I feel that Marina is a well developed, complex character, as are her boarding school peers, caretakers, and parents."
3,So Much To Tell You,"I read So Much To Tell You in english class this year. It is anO.K book. It is a little strange because this girl, Marina, did notspeak because something had happened with her and her father a year back...It is kind of interesting to see how she communicates with other people, you actually get excited when she does because it does not happen to often. When Marina does finally talk, it is for a good cause and that is what makes that ending pretty good."
3,So much to not tell you...,"Ugh. This book could have been so much better. I was gripped from the beginning, couldn't wait to get to the end to see whether the conclusions I'd drawn from all the hints were correct. BUT the end is so disappointing I couldn't believe it. I hate books that leave the reader hanging and forced to draw their own conclusions, I prefer things spelt out. In places the story was so moving I was almost in tears, but unfortunately the ending spoiled what could have been a true hard-hitting masterpiece."
5,Emotional and moving story,This book is great. It shows the emotional feeling of a person if they have a physical or mental dissorder. It shows you can make it through tough times. Her friend was her diary. I recommend it for secondary school students(12-18 year old).
5,i loved this book it was the best,i usually dont like to read but this book kept me hooked like i was plaing a video game or some thing....
3,Just average,"If you're relatively new to the music and style of Little Louie Vega, you'll like this one.But if you're like me, a seasoned house-head for the past 21 years, this one is just average. Don't get me wrong, the music is good stuff. But I've heard most of the songs on this disk already - either I own the vinyl or I have some compilation that has these records. There's nothing earth-shattering here."
4,FOUNDATIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH,"Plain English easy to understand and all points are explicate, such profound and lasting knowledge developed its substance grasp one's mind in knowing God is absolute ultimate."
1,False Advertising,Did not match the description and was filled with highlighting and pen and pencil writing. Had to PAY to return it and still have not gotten my credit.
5,"Tender, Poignant Sharing","Reverend Kohno is a direct lineage disciple of the late Tendai High Chief Priest, Yamada Zasu. As such, she has presented her insights into the world of Buddhism as a reflection of the Triple Gem of Buddhism (Buddha, Dharma & Sangha) in her own manner (as a priest, as a wife and as a mother). Her views are straightforward and often challenge us to ""practicalize"" our own Buddhist endeavors. Having been presented with this volume atop Mount Hie, HQ of the Tendai Sect, I can support its highest recommendation.Gassho"
2,Progressively ridiculous,"It seems I enjoyed this sequel to the terrific ""Ringu"" more than the other reviewers on this page but still found it to be failure in the end. Medical examiner Mitsuo Ando (Koichi Sato), grief-stricken over the recent death of his son and subsequent loss of his wife, conducts the autopsy on his friend Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada), the psychic who died at the end of the first film. He is drawn into the orbit of the Ring virus by a post-mortem communication from his old friend. Much of this quietly dramatic film is very powerful, but the story becomes increasingly outlandish as it progresses. Sato is outstanding, but he is undone by the screenplay and Joji Iida's direction."
3,Line Number Problem,"I have used Sachs' translation of the Nichomachean ethics and found it helpful, so I will not criticize Sachs' translation technique here. Unfortunately though I could not use this edition of the physics for one simple reason. The line numbers are not in the margines but imbeded in the text, and not bolded. This made it very difficult to use in the semenar style discussions of St. John's College (ironically the college that Sach's is a professor at). So I stopped using it emediately and opted for the complete works version so I could participate in semenar discussions. I would like to give Sachs' translation of the physics a chance but the lack of clear line numbers in this edition is a serious problem for me."
2,Isn't this what Yahoo and Lycos are for?,"If I were you I would not waste my time with this book. As with most books that try to show you ""The Best Sites For..."" the information is only good if kept current. When the book was published a year ago, it may have been current, but now URL's change or close, making it nearly impossible to trust the book."
2,It didn't last,"The product didn't last more than one winter, and cost a lot more than a similar and much cheaper product that I can buy at Walmart. Sure, it came with a guarantee, but who wants to waste time on things like that. I just threw it away when it failed."
1,Only one side worked!,"Bought this (Queen size, dual controls) with high hopes, but was really disappointed to find that only one side worked. The display on the other side would light up, but that was all--no heat, which is probably a good thing because the display wouldn't turn off after 10 hours either. The other side worked just fine. A twin-sized one we bought for my son works just fine, too. Guess we got a lemon! But we returned it and will try another brand. (Bought and returned in a brick-and-mortar store, not through Amazon.)"
4,Good product,"good productI spleep better than before.I don't have toheat the room, only my bed.I recommand this article."
3,great while it lasts,"i was sooo happy with this the first winter i got it. i could keep my side cranked up to 10, while my husband slept with his on 3. warm and snug as a bug in a rug, we placed this heated mattress pad on top of our memory foam topper. it was a dream!the next winter, one side stopped working, it always read ""E"" for error. my kind, warm blooded husband switched sides with me for the winter.this winter, the ""good side"" still reads as tho it is heating, but it doesn't feel like it. finally got around to checking on the 5 year manufacturer's warranty. i had to ship it to them on my own ($20 thru UPS) and now i am left cold, literally, waiting for a replacement which may take ""2-6 weeks, as we are a small operation"". hoping i get it sooner rather than later. i am addicted to the product, just wish it lasted longer."
4,As good as advertised,"All I can said this one does work and still working after a few months, for the money it is quite worth considering with the benefit of being comfort and keep us out of getting sick during the cold winter month."
4,Heated Mattress Pad - Full,"My son LOVES this pad. No more cold bed to jump into. Seems to heat evenly, and the auto shut off is awesome. Digital control is where its at for setting the heat level and 12 hours later it shuts off. You can feel the plug at the bottom of the mattress, but the heat is the trade off. No big deal."
2,Very Uncomfortable,"The Biddeford Electric Heated Mattress Pad. I don't really liked because you can feel the wire under your body even with 2 sheets on top, doesn't get warm fast it takes very long time"
2,I'm looking for a replacement already,"After just a year, my husband's control goes to ""E"" (for error?) when he'd move. The cord at his feet is always fully and tightly plugged in--so it seems to be a short in the actual surface area of the pad. Nothing we can fix. (We are both slim, with no pets or kids in the bed too. I haven't even washed it either.) Another drawback, is the plug-in being right where each of our feet are at the end of the bed. I'll definitely look for another brand."
5,Good Product and Fast Service,The PDGA Standard Disc Golf Bag is a great buy for the disc golf enthusiast. Easy to carry and holds lots of discs! The service was great as well - it arrived very quickly.
3,So-so,"The line-by-line writing isn't bad. For the most part, this is an enjoyable book. But the big resolution that pulls everything together is obvious by about the third chapter. And the random sex scenes are (a). entirely dispensable and (b). very poorly written. I mean, come on, she gives him a massage, and at the end of it he says ""Now I'll massage you -- from the INSIDE!""A good read, but not the mind-blower some of these other reviews made it out to be."
5,A Military Officer that likes mysterys,A mystery that kept me on edge and I could hardly put it down before I completed it.I hope the author has more stores to be published.
2,Story telling vs. writing fiction,"The Trial of Evan Gage is competent writing for a first novel and certainly the plot (although contrived and tried) will hold the interest of readers who enjoy genre prescribed story lines. We have the stock characters such as the mentally disturbed drifter (do they ever turn out to be truly mentally disturbed drifters) and even the hispanic housekeeper, along with a cast of other flat, stereo-typical characters. The dialogue lacks inspiration (as well as wit). One could tolerate this bit of ""entertainment"" were it not for the weak writing sometimes evidenced in first novels. No doubt the next book will be equally ""competent""."
5,Exciting Read,"If you enjoy reading about the military at all or thrillers in general, you will love this book. Its got a gripping and exciting plot, not to mention a ton of research behind it and detail in it.A great read, I'd recommend it to anyone with any story of interest in this genre."
1,The most poorly written book I've ever attempted to read,"This book is unreadable. The horrid syntax is the best part of the book, the content ranges from patronizing to simply offensive. Mr. Robinson makes no effort to understand Luxembourg or learn anything about the languages, instead he makes wild generalized assumptions about those things he doesn't understand (most everything). He strikes me as a middle-aged man stuck in perpetual adolescence. He also has an annoying tendency to drift off subject in mid-paragraph. If you want to know anything factual about Luxembourg, this is not your book."
4,Blissed out Consciousness,"Here's the thing, most music breaks down into little fragmented particles, individual compenents.... parts of orchestra's and instruments that sustain one another to creat the whole - they in and of themselves in each song are a whole-But with this CD' you need to absord the consciouness of the CD, study it like an entire body of work, the entire gallery instead of one art piece. Such that one song - and too one CD - do not accurately represent the journey that you embark.There are two divisions. Before Sunset, And Before Dawn. Each category represent each CD.Enjoy these CDs'. It isn't Chris COCO New Wave or Mellow Yellow but its still very good,admittidly its very uneven at times, and such is the case with many Ministry of sound compilations but nonetheless, it is what it is, and what it is - is pure joy and an authentic picture of the Ibiza blissed out sunsets.With Love,Stefano"
1,"Oh well, MOS has done better ...","I have tons of MOS stuff. Most of their Chill-Out are my most favored CD's. But, this one is a bit off. Don't like it that much."
2,"okay, but not great",Bishop Job gives an adequate presentation that communicates his message and the product is well made. He just does not do that great a job of selling the message.
1,Disappointing Nozzle Set,The hose connection threads on all three of these nozzles wore down over the course of the summer causing them to leak. These are not quality made products.
3,Good for the price.,This product works but is not the best quality you can find. For the price they are not bad. I ended up buying another set for a few more dollars that was much better quality.
4,pleased,my son loved these for xmas. I am glad i was able to get it at a reasonable price and in a timely fashion
4,Heely's,"Like these alot! Very good quality, and they look great as regular shoes when not using the wheels. Have lasted very well, have passed them on to another child, mine outgrew them and they still look brand new."
4,Very nice playing,"This is a great album by a fine ensemble. Though not as well produced and performed as ""Ven Baile Conmigo!"", it deserves a listen for sure."
4,Very useful!,"I had to write an essay on ""Hamlet"" in English class this year, and the Cliffsnotes helped me tremendously (considering that I hadn't even read the book, I wrote a pretty good essay with its help). Each scene is given a thorough explanation, and it has an index of themes and a tree of all the characters. Not only does it simplify the book, it also analyzes further and clears up any confusion about the plot. It helped me a lot, I recommend it highly!"
5,Gift was great,Bought this as a Christmas present for my husband and he was delighted with it. It arrived promptly and was good quality.
5,Been wanting on CD for years,If you know the record and the band you know what this record means. I had a copy of the LP on cassette that I played or years. One of my favorite albums of all time. The bons disc is fllled with some great b sides. Get it now.
3,"Got what i wanted, but...","I got what i ordered except the description was new, and this clearly wasn't. the case was broken, which i don't really care about, but the insert was a bit mangled and the cd looked slightly scratched... although it played just fine. the record is amazing and is a must have for any punk or rock and roll fan. but for 30+ dollars a new case would have been nice."
4,Jed Roberts was a fine CFL D-lineman. Good article!,A very fine article about the CFLand environmental issues withoutgetting too sappy or left-wing &screaming the 'sky is falling'.
5,No wrist/arm pain,"I have replaced my larger mouse with this smaller easy to use mouse. I had arm and wrist pain with the larger mouse (even with a wrist pad), but with this smaller mouse, my arm stays more level and my pain has virtually gone away. I have ordered 2 more, one for my office and one for home."
3,Still fine,"Note that this product is more smaller than usual, but as a petite is fine for me. Few complaints I found that the mouse clicking sound is so annoying me. Overall it's still a nice mouse."
3,Cord 2 feet shorter than claimed by Logitech,"I needed a mouse for my notebook, which I use as my standard PC at home. Because of the desk configuration, I needed the cord to be a length similar to a regular (non-notebook) mouse. I called Logitech prior to ordering this mouse and was assured it was over 4 feet in length. When I got it, found it to be barely over 2 feet. I can't use it. Amazon was great about letting me return the mouse. I think Logitech makes a good mouse, but they need to include cord length in their documentation and provide accurate info via their tech support line."
5,Very comfortable mouse for small hands!,"Being a woman with small hands, I found this to be the PERFECT size for me, and the ergonomic shape is a bonus. It is absolutely THE most comfortable mouse I've ever had. I bought it for use with my desktop computer and wasn't surprised to find that the cable is too short--so I'll need an extender. I'm considering buying one with my own money to take into work--that's how much I like it!"
5,cool mini knife,"fits perfectly between index finger, middle finger & thumb. i was skeptical when i purchased but wanted a small rust proof knife and this had high recommendations. i was blown away by how perfectly this thing was designed to fit in the hand while yet being so damningly small. a very good knife, very high quality steel and super sharp blade. can shave arm hair out of the box. i have a spyder edge salt pacific too, but I'de have to say i prefer this plain better, how ever it is much easier to cut one self with the plain edge."
3,Very sharp but hard to open quickly,"In most regards this is a great little keychain knife; it's compact, sharp, and lightweight. That said, I was personally disappointed to find that even though I have small hands, it's nearly impossible to open this knife with one hand. Upon further inspection, it seems that Spyderco has made several revisions of the Ladybug knife over the years. Some versions have a 5mm hole and others have a 9mm hole. That 4mm different between Ladybug models is make of break when it comes to one-hand openers. In summary, if one-hand opening is important to you, make sure you're buying the version with the 9mm hole in the blade."
5,This is Capstick at his best! A true work of art!!,"This is one of Capstick's greatest works. I am glad that he finally wrote something about tigers! The cannibal chapter was a real eye-opener. I truly enjoyed him finally telling some of George Rushby's adventures. The ""Njombe Maneaters"" was superb. This is another shining example of Capstick's work. It is a real ""MUST READ."""
1,"BADLY written, directed, what a WASTE","carrie must have fallen off the edge when she wrote this...maybe she was living in her FATHER'S house.....this was not funny at all.and it made her mother and her co-stars look like fools...carrie had a chance to have these stars in one movie..and she made them look like dirt throwing dames....the sad part of the whole thing is....it was life as carrie lived it..debbie must have to take some of the blame..but i could see EDDIE""S handprint on it too....carrie will never forgive the parents.....it's to bad"
2,Not My Favorite,"I bought this because I was watching Shirley MacLaine movies. The plot was predictable, the dialogue was uninspired, and there was too much slapstick for my taste. I thought it was a waste of old broads."
1,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING,What we have here is a big mess! Debbie Reynolds is too over the topElizabeth Taylor trying to be Sue Mendes ( she doesn't pull that off) We then have Shirley who is much better than the screenplay! I about lost my lunch when there was a sex scene with Joan Collins! This was the sickest thing on film since Pink Flamingos!
5,Great Old Broads,This dvd was great and the gals have held up very well. The seller was prompt and dvd was as described
2,Predictable,"Movie a disappointment, with tired jokes, predicatable plot and outcomes and overall movie was not flattering to the main stars. Having them do pratt falls and insult one another about age, comsmetic surgery and affairs. Overall movie tiring, didn't watch it to the end."
4,"More of these ""old broads"", please","This film is a great chance to see these wonderful actresses(Taylor, Reynolds,MacLane) acting again! It is a farce from the beginning to the end, and you can tell these women let go and really had fun with it! I would love to see all three of these women in another film soon, especially Ms Taylor. They have so much to offer all of us! They really Don't make ""STARS"" like this anymore. And I for one, find that terribly sad!"
5,Movie Stars Unite!,"The very witty and talented Carrie Fisher wrote this film, and it unites classic movie stars Shirley MacLaine, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins, and Fisher's mother Debbie Reynolds. For that reason alone, this movie is worth watching. The supporting talent is also great: Jonathan Silverman, Gene Barry, Pat Harrington, Pat Crawford Brown, and Nestor Carbonell.I loved this movie when it first aired on television, and for years waited for a DVD release (it was released on VHS previously, but only recently came to DVD). It is clear that the women are having a ball.I find this film to be very funny and entertaining. It's worth watching alone for all of the assembled talent. The picture and sound are excellent, but there are no bonus features (I would have loved an interview with Carrie Fisher)."
5,Heartwarming... Stevenson's best!,"This is one of D.E. Stevenson's best works, in my opinion. It is a homey, heartwarming story in which Mrs. Tim must leave her husband in Africa and face the dreaded aeroplane flight all alone, as well as the daunting task of finding a house and fending off a bullying landlady, but Tony takes her under his wing and then, it's only a matter of finding out why there are no more letters from Tim...."
1,What a shame,"What a shame that the only film that Sam Shepard has directed Jessica Lange in to date turns out to be such a disappointment. Who can tell what Shepard was intending with this. Beth Henley whimsy? Whatever it was, it sure isn't watchable. I passed my time playing six degrees of Kevin Bacon with the actors. While it does feature some lovely views of Duluth, Minnesota, you know something is amiss when a horse gets better screen treatment than Jessica Lange."
3,A country road film!,"In the beauty Minnesota landscapes, a little familiar accident in which a horse is involved will open the gate to explore the conceptual differences and points of view around what will be the final destiny of the guilty horse.A very simple drama which deserved a major and most elaborated treatment. By this reason, the cast is wasted in innocuous dialogues and common places."
3,interesting...,"Really the only reason that I bought this product was the fact that Jessica Lange is in it. I think She is an amazing actress, and she is in fact the reason that I would want to watch this film again and again. She is, as always, great and funny in this film. But I do overall think that it is an interesting piece in it self too."
5,First Class,"This is a great Jazz style album. Its not rock. There other albums in my opinion lean more towards rock (which is ok) but this one does not. I actually love it but it is difficult to classify exactly what type of jazz it is. Maybe smooth. Irregardless, it is a wonderful album. I think their best. Every cut is very easy to listen to. As always if in doubt buy it used."
3,wutz up w/ this,in reply to the guy sayn i dunno if any1 noticed this but all the reviewz here r for physix n chem but it should be for math... well my reply is it should also be for spanish.
2,Where are the Lesson Plans?,"I'm disappointed. As part of an ongoing quest to motivate students to read and enjoy Hamlet, I purchased this DVD for $35. The description said it came with lesson plans which was one of the main reasons I purchased it. It arrived on time from Amazon and the DVD game is professionally done, but there are no lesson plans! Even the back of the DVD says. ""Lesson Plans: This DVD contains teacher lesson plans and student worksheets in pdf format."" They are nowhere to be found and the web address listed on the site is not operation. I will be returning this. Unfortunately, I had to open it and play it to find out that it is not what was advertised. I hope this does not cause me headaches when I go to return it."
5,great double stroller!,"i am so pleased with this purchase. the price was right and it is light and convenient and PERFECT>>>> it has made life easier with two kids of my own, plus another that i take care of!!! truly a GREAT CHOICE (and i DID MY research!)..."
2,TOO BIG!!,I do not recommend this particular stroller to anyone! It is way to wide to fit into any public restroom or any other door!
2,Needs improvement...,"I bought this stroller about a month ago for my 3 year old and 4 month old. After I put it together, I was so excited since it was so much smaller, lighter and easier to fold than our last tandem, double stroller. I used it once, folded it an put it in the back of our van. When I took it out again, the sunshades were mis-shapen and we were unable to get them back in shape. This made me a little unhappy, but I was still able to use it. The next time we used it, I was pushing it in the mall and the front middle wheel just broke off. It was not ""fixable"". I was unhappy at this point and decided to try to return it to the store, since we only used it twice and it was broken. Toys r us graciously accepted the return no questions asked (thank goodness). I do like the idea of a side-by-side over the tandem, since they seem to be much more compact, and plan to look for another brand. I may have purchased a lemon, but I wouldn't recommend this particular stroller based on my experience."
4,Great buy,Great stroller for two kiddos. Easy to use and very easy to manuever.Only lacks storage. But as grandparents we do not need that as often for our grandchildren
4,It serves its purpose,"I needed a double stroller that fits into the trunk and still leaves room for 2 weeks of groceries and this is it. No it does not have all the bells and whistles, but it is simple and does the job for my 6 week ols ans 16 month old. Oh and it is weighted enough that my huge diaper bag does not tip it when no one is in the stroller. The sun bonnets do leave a lot to be desired, but like I said no bells and whistles. I definately recommend it for its simplicity!!"
5,Easy to use!,"I have owned an expensive tamdem stroller and it was too big. I didn't like the fact that I couldn't see both of my children. It wasn't compact and didn't fit in my van either.This stoller is perfect. It's light weight, easy to assemble and use. Also, I am able to see both of my children at the same time! You can't beat the price either. I am very happy with this stroller!"
4,A good read,"Legend is a reissue of one of her earlier novels. It has all of the mix you look for in a Dinah McCall/Sharon Sala book.In several of her books we are asked to believe something that is obviously not true. This has never been a problem if the characters are real enough.Joesph and Raine are real enough for me. Even Benny and his search for the easy way are familiar. The billionaire looking for what his money can't buy is real.I cried when Joseph and Raine buried their son. I felt their struggle to come togather again.As I often say, I read for pleasure. This book was a pleasure. It may have been alittle predictable, but everything turned out alright in the end. That's what counts for me."
5,Fairchild ttl Data book & Cmos Ic (RAM and memory),"I just want some more latest product reference book. I have old one and I want to upgrade and see the data of new product. Could you guide me to select the best one for me. I appreciate to your cooperation and heartily guidance for me. From: Ed (Saudi Telecom co.ltd, K.S.A.)"
5,A MUST HAVE !!!!!!!!!!!,This Item Is A Must Have For Anyone Who Is A Colts Fanatic Or Is From Indy Like Myself. I Highly Recommend This DVD !!!!!!!!!!NFL Super Bowl XLI - Indianapolis Colts Championship DVD
2,Highlight DVD nothing more,This has a run down of the colts season from game one to the Super Bowl.Thats it.Do not expect the Super Bowl without commercials and edited down because thats not what this is.Very disappointing.The AFC championship game of the week is just a post game show.I would have loved to see at least the 2nd half of that game.It was better then the Super Bowl.The only good things where the few extras with Manning and Harrison wired for sound.I hope there is a better one come'n cause this is not worth much.
2,Where's the game,"In the product description, it is stated that there is a cut down version of the game. The only part of the game I can find is the 12 minutes in the season highlight feature. Correct me if I am wrong, the game is not on this DVD. No halftime show either."
1,Misleading & Disappointing,"To be honest, I didn't watch the DVD. I didn't watch it because I expected it to be a DVD of the Superbowl. The title, ""Indianapolis Colts Championship DVD"" sort of lends itself to being exactly that. A DVD showing the championship game. It's not.Also, the product description of ""reliving"" the moments was very misleading. The best way to relive those moments is to see the game in which it was played. This is a cheesy highlight reel of the 06-07 season. In fact, I think that's a great name for it, as opposed to it pretending to be something it's not."
1,False Advertizing!!!,"I paid the big price and reserved this early for my son who was unable to see the game, but there was no game to be seen on this video. Where can you get the complete Super Bowl XLI video?"
3,No Game,This DVD was not what I wanted. It was a overview of the season very good but I wanted to see the whole super bowl XLI game. And it is not on this DVD. As a colts fan I am upset. I think the NFL let us down.
5,Amazing Book!,"This book teaches young children and their parents many useful ESP skills such as:meditation, spoon bending, clairvoyance, dream recall, dream control, psychic plant growing, and many healing techniques"
3,Live Sound,"This gate is working well. One problem what I have is that when it is releasing the signal it is incressed in volume and sound like a ""pop"". I think to try with an gate-compressor which will prevent the ""pops"""
3,Nothing special but still better than nothing,"I have an antique pocket watch from 1876. It's silver and I was planning on using this claim fob with it. I only used it once because the chain was simply too shiny and new looking compared to the watch itself. It's nice looking, I would suggest it with a new watch"
4,Wonderful,I was very nice looking and shinny. It came earyl which made it easier to wrap for a chrisstmas present. Looks like it will last a long time.
5,A Masterpiece,"While it's probably more appealing to SAGA Partisans such as myself than to hardcore D&D fans, this deluxe adventure belongs on every DRAGONLANCE lover's bookshelf as a comprehensive guide to the locations and characters of the War of the Lance, as well as one of the best tellings of that era I've yet seen.I've seen it compared with the original adventures, of which I own about half. In my view, this rewriting lacks some of the encounters and elements of the original, but makes up for that with stronger characters and plotting, tighter continuity, and a greater sense of scope and freedom._DRAGONLANCE Classics, 15th Anniversary Edition_ has become my fundamental reference of the last years of the Age of Despair, and I recommend that everyone with an interest in DRAGONLANCE or in epic fantasy campaigning take a look at it."
1,This is not AD&D...,"For those DMs out there who, like me, want to play those original classic DL adventures, DON'T BUY THIS! The format, style, and most importantly, QUALITY of this product is well below the standards set by the orginals. Personally, I'd have much preferred a reprinting of the orginal modules rather then this. Basically, this is a Saga book with D&D stuff added as an afterthought simply to increase the sales potential. I dunno, Saga players might enjoy, but D&Ders - steer clear and try to find some old copies of the originals."
2,Not What I Expected,"I love the Dragonlance setting, and have for years, but this was a let down. I'd much rather have had a second printing of the original adventures than having them totally reworked in the Saga format. Fans of the original series, I think you should stay away from this. For newcomers this is an ok starting point, and I guess if you want your collection to be complete, like I did, buy this. Otherwise, it's not worth your time."
5,Good Music,I liked CCR and also liked this selection. Buy it and you will not be disappointed It is now downloaded into my Amazon Cloud Player.
4,Interesting read,"This book is about 101 successful businesses and how they got started. Although it does not contain details on how to start a business, it contains lots of good ideas and lots of inspiration, two important qualities of a entrepeneur. You will enjoy reading some better known businesses like Terra Chips as well as lesser known ones like Three Dog Bakery who makes gourmet biscuits for dogs. It's amazing a dog biscuit company makes over a million dollars a year, but since this book is about young millionaires, every company profiled in this book makes over this amount."
1,What a disappointment,"After anxiously waiting for this book to arrive, it only took me a couple of hours to read it. The stories on each entrepeneur were too brief. It tells you how each of them came about w/ their ideas but does not at all provide any information on what exact steps they took to be successful. I was very disappointed. It was a waste of money."
4,prompt service,"satisfied with the service and delivery, received earlier than listed date, like the size and shape of cooler, very light, could use a little more insulation, very thin walls but overall worth the price"
4,does the job,"My husband and I have been using a soft sided cooler for the past 10 years and it finally needed to be replace. I looked every where and finally decided that this cooler was as close to our old one as I was going to get. It is as spacious as we need, however the handles being on the ends and being small makes it hard to carry with one hand. We found a shoulder strap from something else and connected the two small handles. Doing that makes it easier for one person to handle along with other items, but not really comfortable. It does the job but not as good as I want or need. If you need cold for a 3 or 4 hours then it would be great, my husband needs it to keep items COLD for up to 12 hours. The top opening makes it very convenient to get to the inside."
2,Liltink,"This used to be a great cooler. It did actually come with a padded shoulder strap. Because of the redesign with no strap I could only give 2 stars. My husband is a railroader and needs an easy-to-carry cooler on train trips. Now, unless he makes a strap, he cannot carry this on his shoulder. Since he has to carry other equipment, this will no longer work. To say the least, I cannot imagine why the shoulder strap was eliminated."
5,Alive and Kicking video,"I feel this is a fantastic instructional video for just about any drummer on earth,because this video teaches us how to create and have our own sound in drumming.We should be thankfull for being blessed with a great teacher like mr David Garibaldi."
2,good grip poor durability,"I bought a traxxas 4 tec 3.3 3 days ago, I'm an experience nitro driver, and yet after just the break in period, and about an hour and a half of normal running, the right rear tire shredded on me. and at $40 a set that's the third most expensive thing on this car following behind the motor and the exhaust. I'm going to upgrade with something a little more durable, can't see spending the money on something that won't last. Fun car but poor tire quality"
1,Where's the Science?,If you are looking for a discussion of the issues or the forces that cause climate change you won't find it in this book. The author writes well but brings no debate or science to the fore. Sorry but it is mostly just a rehash of the alarmist camp. The author quotes two graphs and data that have already been debunked and proven incorrect but she has done no investigation of her own to determine their validity... ergo no science. For readers really interested in learning about climate change and what causes it I would suggest any of the following titles: Unstoppable Global Warming by singer and Avery; The politically incorrect Guide to Global Warming by C. Horner; or any of the books by Bjorn Lomborg.
3,Is Man responsible for increased temperatures?,"I bought this book in the hope that I would find a factual presentation of Man's responsibility in global warming. I found that the book presents strong evidence that the Earth is warming up. Man is, of course, partially responsible for that, since the first time he started a fire by rubbing two sticks together.The question the book doesn't answer is whether Man's responsibility is a significant factor in warmer Earth temperatures. Instead the book just dives in to what can be done, and what isn't being done to reduce CO2 emissions.Not addressing Man's significance in increasing the Earth's temperature, leaves the reader without any useful additional information. We all know that the Earth is heating up, and that burning fossil fuels is partially responsible for that. The question is, how big is that part?"
2,"Field Notes from a Catastrophe: Man, Nature, and Climate Change","About what I expected. Unfortunately, the book was extremely biased looking only at science that supported her hypothesis. It is an interesting read, written in an easily readable style but rather shallow in content."
3,"Catastrophe not coming, yet","Kolbert writes well and has collected many anecdotes to support her catastrophist view. She is. of course, highly biased, sometimes comically so, but at least she is honest about it. The data are outdated, inevitably, because the book was written in 2006. So, you cannot really blame Kolbert for failing to mention that the global catastrophe has not happened yet, but actually global temperatures have kept constant, more or less, or even decreased slightly. I suppose you can say that it is bad enough to be stuck at the high temperatures of the last decade, and the Arctic keeps melting."
5,"A short, loud, urgent warning","Little by little the skeptics of global warming are falling away. Let's hope this brief and very persuasive book shakes loose a few more of them, because Kolbert, an unbiased reporter and one of the best non-fiction writers of English today, makes it clear that the time to act on anthropogenic climate change is ten years ago. Were it not that the subject matter is inherently depressing, this book would be a sheer pleasure to read---and as it is, it can and should be read by everyone who has a middle school diploma. If you are considering buying it, stop reading the reviews right now and make the purchase. Then read it and pass it on."
1,Error on a G string,"The album CLASSICAL GUITAR: VARIATIONS IN MEASURE is made up of 14 tracks by an appropriately anonymous musician. The tempo and mood of these songs ranges from listless to moribund. Where that might be OK for Pachelbel's Canon, such an approach is all wrong for ""Malaguena,"" which here sounds like a funeral dirge. The recordings have nice echo added-- unfortunately not enough to obscure these poorly performed selections.

5,great book,"Great book, easy read. Really life changing. Would recomond reading. Small book but powerful. I downloaded it on my kindle and was hooked as soon as I started reading."
5,Awesome book,"This is one of the best books I own - it is a short, compact, practical, concise treasure chest of pearls for living. I have read and re-read it numerous times, and have given away more copies than I can count. I highly recommend ""The Red Sea Rules"" for anyone contemplating when and how to make the next move, whatever that may mean. Excellent book!!!"
5,Fantastic book!,"This is an amazing book that shares many deep truths in a short and easy to read manner. It's a reminder that Old Testament lessons never die, despite the culture being different."
3,I guess I wasn't in the right frame of mind,"It's a little hard to be the first to give this book less than five stars, so maybe my rating says more about me than the book. For me, though, while I found the 10 rules themselves to be solid, the supporting stories I felt often added little to the mere statement of the rule. Often they seemed only tangentially related. My greatest complaint is there just seemed to be so little depth. I can't think of a single time I thought about what the book said after I closed it. This book obviously has been helpful for many, but that wasn't my experience."
5,The Red Sea Rules,This is an excellent Bible Study Book. I received it in a timely and efficient manner. Thank you for the good service.
5,Possibly the most encouraging book I have read in years,"I received this book last week as encouragement from a friend. While I have yet to overcome the current obstacles in my own life, I am reassured and even confident that God is in control. God will be glorified! While I have been involved in church and even ministry most of my life, the simplicity of the Israelites' story and the profound truths the author has pointed out firmly establish why I can have hope as a Christian. The truths about God's love and care have never been clearer or more meaningful to me as the author directs me to reflect on God's providence for His own. I have been so blessed by this book that I came to this website to see about getting multiple copies through which I may encourage others! As my friend wrote wrote, ""May the Holy Spirit use this humble book to encourage you and give you greater faith and hope for the future - we know, because God cannot lie - that His plans for us are only good!"""
1,Have not received this book. Hope it is coming.,I have not received this book but want it. I do not hate it. I am sure I will enjoy when I get it. I hope I am going to receive it!
5,"Small, but mighty!","I was diagnosed a year ago with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. I was visiting with my Pastor and he happened to have this book on his desk and said I might find comfort in reading it. This book may be small, only 112 pages, but it is powerful. In fact, I purchased five extra books knowing that somewhere, someone was going to need the same encouragment I received during a time of great sorrow. I finally gave away my last book today--a year later. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is going through any life threatening situation or feeling as if there's no way through the struggle. As the books states, ""The same God who led us in will lead us out!"""
5,Adaptec does it again!,"Adaptec is well known for their SCSI cards. They have been making them for years! This card is made to connect up to 7 devices, preferably Ultra SCSI devices carrying a max transfer rate of 20MB/sec. Be cautious, this card does not have a bootable BIOS ROM, so you can't boot from any device that is connected to this card. If you need to do so, purchase the AHA-2940.You can connect Zip/Jaz drives, CD ROM, CDR/CDRW drives, hard drives, etc.This card has an internal 50-pin IDC connector and one external HD68 connector.Easy to install and no problems encountered, highly recommended with 5 stars.I have been using this card for several years with a CD Recorder and CD ROM on a Windows 98 Machine."
4,Scsi Card,"I thought this was a very good scsi card. I had gone through about three scsi cards when my friend told me about Adaptec cards. I bought one and it has been the last card I've gotten, it is compatible with my computer and all of the devices that I have tested with it. If you want to start using scsi interface for your peripherals than this is the card for you. It delivers blazing bandwidth. it only started to become slow when I hooked up 13 devices to it. Adaptec is by far the best brand when it comes to scsi. This is an excellant product!!!"
1,Even the children betray Elvis Presley,Even the children betray Elvis Presley for only damned money.Elvis always respected children and these little people sell him wholesale.
4,Mom was happy with crossword puzzle dictionary,"I bought this crossword puzzle dictionary for my Mom, and she is very happy with it. It came to her promptly, it was inexpensive, and it was what she wanted. Sometimes my Mom is a hard person to please."
1,Very dissappointed,"The material contained is excellent but the print is so small that neither my wife or I can read it without a magnifying glass. It's my fault for ordering it, had I noticed the size of the book I would have realized the print would be tiny. My wife has worn out a larger version (8.75 X 5.75), I'll look for the full size now."
3,"Poor quality ink, printing and paper.","Hard to read due to blurry printing and letters running together. I thought this edition would be better than my old one, which is glued and taped together, but it's not as good. However, it does have a few lists of things at the end of the book which the old edition didn't have."
3,Crossword Puzzle Fanatic,"The content is excellent. My husband has the second edition by the same author and has worn it to a frazzle and I was hoping to throw that one away when this one arrived but since it is not as easy to read because of the size of the print and the size of the book (pockekbook size whereas the last one was 6x9)I think that is not going to happen! I had searched every bookstore for this book but did not find it so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.com. He has numerous other books but none of them satisfy his need as much as this one. So therefore, I am disappointed with the book. He will go back to the old one. Would you like to see an old delapidated book sitting on your table all the time? No, No.The USPS service was very slow but of course it was at Christmas time. Thanks for the opportunity to comment."
2,Same as one I bought 4 or 5 years ago,this is same one I already had - I thought this would be an updated copy but was still 2nd printing but will keep it
3,Sent the wrong book,"Ordered: Merriam-Webster Crossword Puzzle Dictionary, Second Edition, as was shown on the ad, used.Received: The item shown on this comment request. Different format, not as useful. Not worth time and effort to return. Would try again, but skeptical about the outcome. The other used ones were very cheap and may not be better than the one we have had for a dozen years, is very beat up, but better than the one we bought."
4,Design Flaw,I love this frother! Except for one thing. On each side where the bottom clips into the top. There are two buttons. Under (behind) each button is this ultra tiny spring. I have lost one and was frustrated because it wouldn't close. I realized the spring of the other side was slipping. I managed to get the other back on and now it's holding. It works great otherwise!
3,Bonjour Frother,"I love this frother, but after 3 years of use, maybe once a week, the case has broken on both sides. I put tape on it, but that doesn't help. I would like to get it repaired but don't know where to send it."
2,"Works great, but a fragile item","I bought mine in May and it worked great. I was changing the batteries and it popped apart faster that I expected and I dropped the whisk side on the counter - not a far drop - just from my hand to the counter top. It never worked right after that. Now it's August and I'm ordering a new one. It's just a little too fragile, otherwise it works like a charm. Just don't ever drop it.UPDATE March 2009: I bought a second one in August. Was very careful with it - and this morning it just died. I changed the batteries. Dead. 7 months. Not worth the money. I'm going to look for something new. It's too bad because it really is a great frother - but to not even last a year? Sadly disappointed and the company totally does NOT stand behind their product at all."
2,breaks easily,"The frother works well as others have said. Unfortunately, it broke very easily when I dropped it into the sink while cleaning. I've only had it 3 or 4 months but did not save any warranty info. This device needs to be made stronger to withstand normal kitchen events."
4,Great product. But don't drop it.,"I have bought three of these. Two for me, and one for my sister. This is a great little milk frother. If you make your espresso with a hand pump or stovetop pot, this will provide the perfect milk for your latte. I used to own big espresso machines, but they never made good coffee. Use separate devices and you get better components.Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Makerthis pump makes great espresso, even on the road! or camping!But be careful not to drop this frother. If you are lucky, the battery compartment will pop open, but for me the wand broke off, and that was not a repair at home injury. That is why I had to buy a second for me, and I would buy a third if I needed to."
4,Super easy frothing & cleaning,"Originally I wanted to replace my old Bodum hand frother but I found this little thing and decided to try it. It is excellent :) I froths cold or warm milk no problem and makes yummee lattes, chocolates etc. It is real easy to clean which is an absolute plus - otherwise I would not use it.The only draw back is that if you hold it to hard one can accidently push the sides and the buttom comes of as if you wanted to change the batteries. It does not happen to me but to my husband so he is slightly upset with it.... until he tastes the delicious latte :)"
2,Primo?,"Poorly designed. Stirring rod is not removable for cleaning. Installing batteries is a major challenge if you do not have good dexterity. In fact, I damaged mine installing the batteries (which are not included). If you can overlook those shortcomings, it does work. Given the hefty price and sleak appearance, I will have to call it ""junque."""
1,a waste of time and money,"This item is a waste of time, money and AA batteries.Unless you're fanatic about foam....forget it!"
5,lotta latte,It's truly amazing to see the amount of foam this quiet little machine generates. A half cup of cold milk whipped and then heated in the microwave will expand to make plenty of foam to top four lattes.
5,I love this product,"This product makes great frappes and looks very stylish on the counter and it is not too bulky. I loved it so much I bought one for everyone I know who loves frappes. I had bought the same one and it lasted me about 4 years before it went kaput, and that is the longest any frappe maker has ever lasted in my house, and they get used and abused in my house."
1,Failed within a Week,"I really hope that this is an anomaly, but the frother broke within a week of using it. I really don't know what happened, but the motor seems to have gone and changing the batteries, of course, hasn't done anything. I'm returning it as I write.Whilst working it was really great - wonderful, which really makes a tasty difference to your morning coffee."
5,Bonjour Primo Latte Frother,"When my previous frother broke I was so disheartened. I had found one, not this one, at last, that worked and was half way comfortable. then the grandkids came, and voila..no more working frother! As most of us know, all frothers are not the same, and I did not have the time or energy to do the search through the stores and testing. So after a couple hours of online research I chose the Bonjour Primo Latte Frother. It is extremely comfortable at any angle due to its ergonomic design. It's longer stainless shaft makes it easier to use in tall latte mugs and reaches lower into the mug. And it is incredibly powerful, whipping up creams, or froth in moments. I even use it for my quick power smoothies. One of the best purchases I made this year!Highly recommmeded for any kitchen..( or to throw in your suitcase when travelling and want that froth every morning for your lattes!)"
2,Very unreliable,"I've owned 2 of these...the first one worked awesome for a period of time, then got lame. Be careful not to bend the frothing wire....any little bend puts it out of round and it won't work well any more. So I got a new one, which worked well for a while, then got lame as well. I've tried 2 new sets of batteries in the one I use now, which usually improves the performance dramatically (it stops frothing the slower it spins), but now new batteries don't do much either. I won't buy this brand again."
4,works well w/o microwave,"I used to make milk foam using coffee press; however, after I start using this little thing, I am not going back to the press. The foam generated using coffee press cannot compare to Bonjour frother at all 'cause the foam is not as thick and fine.I use Bonjour frother by following the instructions with cold soy milk and instantly I see it thicken and double the amount of foam! Since I am adverse to microwave, I simply add my coffee into the foamy soy milk and it tastes just like the latte/cappuccino/mocha I ordered from my favorite coffee house! How lovely it that!The only downside I can say is the location of the switch. 8 out of 10 times when I put the frother back to the holder, I end up accidentally *trigger* the switch. No big deal! I just need to be mindful as I put it back to the holder."
5,Useful little frother. Great for camping!,"This little frother does the trick and puts out plenty of power and lasts quite awhile on just 2 AA batteries. I mostly use for frothing milk when I feel like having a latte. I also make all my own salad dressings and often use this to mix the oil with other liquid ingredients. It tends to tip over, but not often enough to outweigh its advantages. It is also really useful for camp cooking (Latte for breakfast anyone?). Even though tippy on a camp table, it's easy enough to duck tape the stand to the side of a table or your camp kitchen to keep it upright and firmly in the stand."
1,Doesn't work. Terrible product.,"The first time I received this frother, the holes where the batteries needed to be inserted were too small--I really had to jam in the batteries (and yes, I made sure I was using the correct size, AA). Even after getting the batteries in place, the frother simply wouldn't work. I tried three different pairs of brand new batteries and none produced even the slightest response. I even tried inserting the batteries the wrong way up, just to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding the directions or that the instructions weren't printed improperly--still no response. I sent back the product for a replacement (thanks to Amazon, it arrived the next day) and had the same problem. Neither of the frothers would work. I'm not sure if something has been changed by the company--I ordered this product because it had high reviews--but this was a COMPLETE WASTE of time and money. Avoid at all costs."
5,Doubles the volume!,"Actually, I LOVE this thing - and when I got it as a gift, I thought it was pretty hokey. I used to work at Starbucks and I know there's no faking frothy, steamed milk.But this guy does it!To clean it I just dab a drop of dishsoap on it and send it spinning under the hot tap.To change the batteries, make sure to squeeze *both* sides of the case.This makes giant, fluffy hot chocolates - it does an amazing job with the marshmallows! As dorky as it is, I now have it in high rotation in my kitchen!"
4,Nearly perfect frother,"We own the rechargeable version of this as well. Both work quite well in making froth. However, this battery version falls short of the rechargeable and so gets 4 stars for two reasons: The switch design placement is very awkward (on the side of the thing) and really does not fall to hand easily. The other version has the power button on the top, so it is easy to hold it pinched upright and press the button with an index finger. Also, the stand is not very stable. Since it hangs, the whole thing is top-heavy and prone to being knocked over easily. The recharger stand is designed to accept the device upside down, so it is bottom-heavy. (The recharging unit seems to use magnetic induction, just like most modern electric toothbrushes.)Otherwise, for the price and since it still does work well, this battery only version is a good value."
2,Doesn't last long,Only used it 5-6 times. Worked great but fell apart 5 days after the 30 day guarantee expired. Inner spring broke. Body won't stay snapped together.
2,Primo Latte NOTay,"I had an earlier edition of a BonJour frother that was rock solid and frothed it's little heart out for a few years. then I dropped it and broke it leading me to THIS BonJour frother. This one pales in comparison. A light weight flimsy version for sure and one that needs a battery replacement way too often. Probably because it only calls for one AAA battery and the older version used four at a time. It DOES froth well, so I guess if you are very careful with it and have a drawer full of batteries, you will get by."
1,Aching Thumbs Down,"I had an IKEA frother for years that was terrific and cost about $6. When it died, I decided to order online since I wasn't heading to IKEA anytime soon. I ordered this frother because of the good reviews and because I liked the idea of the stand. Alas, it was practically unusable for me because it took so much pressure to press down on the power button to make it work, which has to be held down as you use it.I don't have arthritis and have never experienced this kind of difficulty before - very unpleasant. But I was too lazy to return it so used it each morning to froth milk for my coffee. After about 3 weeks and two battery replacements, it stopped working all together.I cannot recommend this frother for any reason. Only plus is the stand, which was a nice feature and earned one star."
5,Recommended by Chef Don,"Primo is a good name for this frother. It works exceptionally well after you get the hang of it. Make your own ""Poor Man'"" latte with it. Make a frothy milk in a cup, warm it in the microwave for about 15 seconds and bingo, pour in your decaf or regular coffee and you've got a latte. Or use for a topping on a hot breakfast cereal on cold mornings. My battery in our frother has lasted for two years, and I use it nearly every day.The No-Salt, Lowest-Sodium Cookbook,The No-Salt, Lowest-Sodium International Cookbook,The No-Salt, Lowest-Sodium Light Meals Book,The No-Salt, Lowest-Sodium Baking Book"
2,works well but,"I bought this item after seeing one at a friends home. I have been using it and really enjoying it but I wish that it was of a more robust construction. For simply frothing milk it's fine but once I got this thing I started wondering ""what else could one do with it?"" Surprisingly enough the frother made a single portion of whip cream from heavy cream and sugar, but it really struggled towards the end of the process as the cream got thick. Yesterday I used it to make a BBQ sauce from ketchup, brown sugar vinegar and other spices...but once again the viscus nature of the liquid was a bit of a chore for the frother to command.So as a frother and for blending sugar into a cold solution of tea or coffee it works great. But it would be an incredibly usefull kitchen tool if it was just of a slightly sturdier construction with a bit more powerful motor."
3,Design flaw,"The frother-end has a coiled spring which is hard to clean. An earlier version had a flat metal piece, which was a much better design and was easy to clean"
3,"NOT made of ""brushed aluminum""","Even though this product states that it is made of ""Brushed Aluminum"", this is NOT so: the satin silver portion of this frother is made of plastic, and only painted to look somewhat like aluminum. However, this BonJour Primo Latte Frother is still a high quality unit, and its metal stand is quite useful and very sturdy."
2,Poor quality. Very disappointed,I am very disappointed with this model. I bought 3 (2 for gifts) because I liked the look and had other models that worked well. I have had mine for about 2 years. The problem is that the black housing is so thin where the buttons are that open to the battery compartment that they break right off when you replace the batteries.
4,Works Great,Milk frothers...they work and it's about how you prepare the milk beforehand. Use half and half as it works best as far as volume and I put about 2 ounces of it in a microwaveable cup and put it on high for 16 seconds...take it out and use the wand until you get a really good froth going ( about 12 seconds ) and then spoon out the froth onto your coffee. Been doing this for 3 years w/o a problem. You don't need an expensive machine or one of those things you use by hand...they are a PIA.
3,Better than the $1.25 ones from IKEA,"...but it isn't head-and-shoulders better in terms of quality. It seems to spin a bit faster, and can add some froth if you're using a lighter milk. It feels cheap, though, particularly when you change the batteries."
3,"OK, but not the best ...","I've had a three of these BonJour battery-powered frothers. They froth fine but have two drawbacks. First, the stem is only light-gauge wire and hence is vulnerable to bending out-of-true. Once that happens it's goodbye to good frothing. Second, the slots for the two AA batteries are very narrow. I use rechargeable batteries and neither Duracell nor Sanyo AA rechargeables will fit properly. So I switched to the Aerolatte Deluxe Edition. It costs $10 more. But it froths just as well, is better made and has neither of these two drawbacks."
2,Shaft is too Thin,"We have had a few hand-held frothers. The stand is handy, but the shaft isn't strong enough to froth. Wobbles and just stirs the coffee."
2,when it works it's great,"This was a very frustrating product. It worked great when it worked, but it was hard to keep it working because the two parts were joined by a very minimal plastic thread and it frequently fell apart in my hands when frothing, when bumped against something or on the counter with no apparent reason. I would not buy this product again, even though it did a great job of frothing WHEN IT WORKED."
4,Almost perfect,"I bought this item to replace my IKEA frother. I was very happy with this purchase. It works great. Well worth the money. I took one star off, because it now broke in a rather unfortunate way -- it still works great, but the latches that hold the battery cover cracked, and without them the piece just falls apart -- a design flaw that should have been fixed. It lasted about 3 years. I am buying another one."
4,Great except for the power switch,"I've gone through 2 of these already -- both of them started experiencing problems with the switch after about 6 months of use (about 600 uses). It appears that the manufacturer only guarantees that this item is not defective when you get it out of the box! I just replaced my second frother with an AerolatteAerolatte Frother, Satin Finishwhich seems to work at least as well. I just Aerolatte without the stand -- the stand from the Primo Latte seems to work just fine with the Aerolatte. Also the Aerolatte has what seems like a much better switch and has a 5 year limited warranty rather than none.For either of the frothers, I'd suggest using rechargeable batteries -- this sucker really uses up batteries. It seems like I was replacing them about every two weeks."
2,"Weak frother, overpriced, get the one from Ikea for $3 instead","I've been looking for a good frother to make my Greek Frappe coffee. I got this for Christmas and I'd have to say it's SLOW. I had bought a different frother from Ikea for $3 and that one spins so much faster and stronger than this one (don't use Ikea batteries). So save your money. Other notes: the stand is so lite that it falls over when removing it, the unit itself looks cool but that's it. I recommend buying one that uses 4 batteries instead or just get the cheap one from Ikea.Update: using good quality batteries helped, but mine has just died after 2 years of casual use. Like some other reviews the motor slowed to a crawl and won't spin at all now even with new batteries."
4,Easy latte,The Primo Frother is great! So easy to use and clean-up is a snap. It really does a fast job of frothing.
4,nice wand & proper,"I bought iI to replace my old froather.It works very well. These are Some tips to do.Prepare your espresso, I use Presso.Put your milk into . 12-16 Oz Mug. Heat it in microwave for 75 sec. Get it out pour it into milk jug.Use the froather for 30 sec until it thick enough.Pour the milk foam into your espresso."
2,Stopped working after 10 months,Did a good job while it worked. Now will not work at all or only spin slowly now. Not the batteries. Other reviews saying the same thing. Will not buy this brand again; although I see almost the same review with all of these types of frothers.
4,Love this little fellow,"It's easy to use, easy to clean and works great. This would make a great gift, especially to your hosts, if you are a house guest."
4,Awesome frother,A friend shared her excitement with me over this frother and raved about it's performance. I saw for myself how easy and efficiently it worked and had to get my very own. I can say that I haven't been disappointed and would also recommed this to others. The stand makes it very convenient to use and provides space saving storage at the same time.
1,Did not mentioned was disposable,"Product description did not mentioned it was disposable after 6 months of use. Sorry to put it this way, but do not recommend this product.. It is not even worth to a return..."
1,BAD QUALITY PRODUCT,"I've purchased 5 of these in the couple of years...they work great for about about 3 months and then suddenly die. The motor or the coil inside must be made very cheaply in China. I'm fed up with having to buy them over and over again so I'm going to find a different brand and hope it can last a least a couple of years. After all, the only thing we do with it is to froth up some cream in our coffee each morning."
3,Great but has a very short life.,"I have owned over six of these. They are great when they work, but they have a notably short life. Also, the batteries don't last very long. I have recently purchased a manual frother that is easier to use, does not have the issues this frother has, and goes in the dishwasher: HIC Brands that Cook Stainless Steel Milk Frother, 14-Ounce Size. I am much happier with the manual frother."
2,Very Light Duty,A very nice looking and effective tool while they last. The problem is that they are just too light duty for more than very occasional use. I've gone through two short order using them at home 2-3 times a day and will now look for a better solution.
1,"Maybe an apt soundtrack, but dull as dust as music","Amazon listed this a few months back as an essential recording for any complete collection. Based on that and some 5 star reviews I bought it. In terms of disappointment, this one ranks up there with Chris Whitley's Din of Ecstacy. I can imagine how this sound track might set just the right mood for a depressing movie set in a god-forsaken, wind-blown town on the Texax prarie. After a second listening, it's one place I know I never want to go again."
1,Another tired attempt to prove the Roswell cover-up.,"This book is yet another attempt to prove that a UFO crashed in Roswell and the government covered it up. A conjecture-laden drivel cover-to-cover. Read Phillip J Klass' ""The Real Roswell Crashed Saucer Coverup"" for the definitive word on Roswell. Don't bother with this one."
1,Hot air and conjecture,"Predictable and dull. It should be given no more creedence than other science fiction.Wiht all of his work, there is more than a smattering of self-congratulatory patting on the back from a man who has wholly bought into the self created myth of himself.Research best summed up as - I know a guy who has a friend who knows a guy who worked with a woman who said this really happened so it's a fact!Anyone want to buy a bridge?"
5,MJ12-Truth or Fiction?,This book is a must read for all those interested in UFO's and proof of their coverup by the government. The author Dr. Friedman is very knowledgeable and his investigative prowess is second to none. I highly recommend this book.
2,Annoyingly Designed for an Immature Audience,Kaplan SAT prep has a cartoon like feel that has more semblance to a Disney video game than software intended to help raise sat scores. Avoid the annoyance!!
1,Defective product,"The first time I used this spout guard, the bubble bath did not drain from the deposit area. When I lifted the top to clean it out, the top snapped & will not snap back down correctly. Also, the spout does not fit correctly on my tub. Only about 4 inches of the tub spout is covered when attached, so water shoots out in every direction. The plastic would have to be cut in order to allow bath & water to mix as needed."
1,Never Arrived,"I would have loved to try this product, but it seems to be on back order. After nearly 2 months, I still have not received it. Unfortunate."
2,Whatever happened to...,"I have always LOVED Anne of Green Gables. Read the books, and was enchanted by the first two films. As soon as I discovered there was a third movie I ordered it. Unfortunately, I did not have anything of the first 2 movies. The 'magic of Avonlea' was gone. The plotline was horrible. Anne and Gilbert got married and ...NOTHING. It was all about the war, war, war. I must admit I had my hand on the remote to fast forward a few times. I could not understand how they could have done this!!!! Some parts were boring and it was as if Anne was not Anne anymore. Now I am trying to forget the movie. The books are a lot better."
2,Glad I Didn't Buy It!,This is NOT the wonderful first movie Anne Of Green Gables as stated by another reviewer it is the disappointing third movie The Continuing Story and I'm so glad that I didn't buy the video but instead taped it when it was shown on TV so I didn't waste any money and I was able to tape over it!
2,It was so disappointing,"I agree with most of the reviews I have read...it was so disappointing. I was so anxious to see what happened with Gilbert and Anne. I imagined them getting married, settling down with Gilbert practicing his medicine and Anne writing her books as they raised a family at Green Gables. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. This movie could have been called Anne and the War since so much time was spent on World War I. I feel the war could have been limited to 30 minutes at the most. I believe Kevin Sullivan owes us a better movie....a 4th movie strictly about Gilbert and Anne perhaps called Home Again and depicting their family life. Megan Fellows and Jonathan Crombie are wonderful actors and I'd love to see them make another movie together even if it's not in the Anne of Green Gables series."
4,Anne of Green Gables III,The members of my home enjoyed this film. At times we cryed others we were laughing. I always felt myself hoping for the best. I am glad to have a conclussion to Annes life. And the end was fabulous. Buy and Own it. Make your own conclussions
5,anne of green gables,"This movie is excellent for all ages. I think everyone should see and own the movie. I already owed Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea and I just bought myself Anne of Green Gables, the continue story. It is like a wish came true for me when I found Anne of Green Gables, the continue story. My friend, who also loved the movie, and I were talking about how we wish they would have the movie what happen to Anne and Gilbert after she finally realized that she loves Gilbert. My sisters also like the movie. She and I watched it about three times a month every since we owed the movie. We love the characters relationships, their brilliant conversation toward one another and the romance."
5,A Wonderful Journey,"After reading some of the reviews posted about Anne III, I thought I would right from the otherside. I thought the movie was outstanding. It is so hard to make sequels to already outstanding award winning films, and I truly believe Sullivan has done this with Anne III. With the passing of Colleen Dewhurst (Marella), Sullivan allowed us to see into Anne and Gilbert's relationship and catch a wonderful view of the Adulthood. I own now all three videos and truly enjoy watching all of them...I highly recommended all three.. You will laugh, cry and smile at this truly magnificent series."
5,This Was As Good As the Others!!,"I was very skeptical of Anne the Continuing Story since it didn't follow any of L.M. Montgomery's books and everyone seemed to think that it made a big difference, but I REALLY enjoyed it and felt that it fit in with the other stories with no problem. The original chracters are in it (all except Diana's husband, and we didn't see much of him in the others anyway)and they all did a wonderful job in picking the story back up again. It didn't get boring, the story was always moving. If you enjoyed Anne of Green Gables for the acting, and the story itself and it doesn't matter if this particular story was a L.M. Montogomery book (like the other reviewer), then I definitely recommend it. Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie among many others did a GREAT job, it was an excellent finish to an excellent series."
4,Excellent short history of the fight for Texas Independence.,"Nofi's book is a particularly well researched and documented work on the fight for Texas Independence from Mexico. A wealth of information is packed into slightly more than 200 pages. It is written without bias and takes a look at some of the many legends of this struggle and seperates fact from fiction. The numerous sidebars within this book offer additional insight to the persons involved, weapons systems, order of battle, and other interesting subjects that give the reader a wider view of was happening during that era. The book is a recommended read and would be impressive for anyone even vaguely interested in Texas history."
3,Be aware of the size and fabric...,"I purchased this for my son who is very thin for his age and it is still snug. I'd say it's made for a 10 year old and not an 11-12 year old. It really is skin tight and can't have clothing under it or it starts to rip. The fabric is extremely thin (as all these marvel costumes are) and will rip easily if worn more than just a couple times. So, overall, fun to wear a few times but if your child is older than 10 or big for their age, I'd consider the adult costume and then tack it or sew it to fit. Should be sold as 8-10 years old for weight and 10-11 for height, not 12."
1,Dont buy not as descibed,"When I bought this it was descibed as""Black Muscle costume""No Muscles but was charged for them..Wont buy from againthanks"
1,I guess they will print anything,"If it were any more possible to write more shallow than thetwo-dimensional characters that run rampant in this book, I am sureScott Smith can do it.1 star was the absolute lowest possible rating I could give this book full of stereotypes and character goals that do not go beyond the ""How about this?"" hypothesis.Any great writer does not make their antagonist 100 percent evil. This is writing 101. There has to be more to a person than action, there has to be motivation and history, both of which I found to be lacking."
5,Out of Print - But a Must for Vintage Purse Collectors!,"Out of print for many years, this book is a treasure. Features nothing but lucite bags, with photos of many that you may search high and low for but, believe me, will never find. Many of the most unusual are closely held by collectors who have no plan to sell, so the only way you'll ever see some of these bags is in this book. The pictures are gorgeous, the history of the bags and the collector fascinating. No price guide, but I agree with the review below, price guides are only guesses and in today's world of ebay, they change month by month. Price guides are a fool's game, experience is the only true teacher."
1,Completely Ruin the Moment,"These are probably the worst condoms I have ever encountered. No matter how much foreplay or lubrication is used they still manage to completely ruin the moment. I hate to be crass but I can think of no other way to describe the sensation than, its like the man's member is wrapped in sandpaper.My husband says from his end, it feels like being wrapped in corrugated tubing. I would avoid these condoms at all cost. Other condoms in the Beyond Seven line are much better and more pleasurable."
1,I Paid the Price,"I paid the price for my own assumptions and for moving too quickly to purchase. I thorough reading of the product description and the track list would have saved me the money I tossed out the window on this audio disappointment. The packaging is slick enough that a quick glance on my part led to believing that this was a packaged soundtrack trilogy, rather than a mediocre rendering by Mask. I'd return it, but it's already opened; I'd burn it, but that would increase atmospheric toxins; I'd bury it, but who knows how long it would take to break down - I guess I'm just stuck with looking at it until we start launching trash into the sun."
2,This version is not orchestrial!,"I wasn't sure how many stars to give because it turns out I missed teh fine-print. This is *not* the score as performed by an orchestria. This is, instead, performed on a synthesizer. Personally I dislike it (and I do like some synthesized classices) and just tossed it.For people who *know* the above fact, I have no idea how to rate this."
2,Synthesized,"I bought this because I enjoy the original soundtrack from the movies, and was looking to expand my classical music collection. The music is completely synthesized...(not stated anywhere in the description) It's a good synthesized job granted, but definitely not what I was looking for. Truly a disappointment."
1,I got the lemon,"Not only is the music performed on a keyboard, but my copy had two ""The Two Towers"" discs. Even though the first disc read ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" it had duplicate tracks from ""The Two Towers"". Luckily I only paid $.99 for it at a music and am now selling it back for $2.95. Howard Shore's scores are magnificent but this rendition of it is pretty bad. If I could I'd give it 0 stars."
4,Misleading but does include some orchestra,"OK, this is not the full orchestrated version of The Lord of the Rings. However, some songs do include some backup from the City of Prague Symphony Orchestra and the Crouch Festival Chorus. Granted, many songs are only Mask's synthesizer, but for a synth recording, it's really not that bad. Think of Rick Wakeman's recordings or Vangelis or Tangerine Dream. if you're a purist, this is certainly not acceptable, but I rather like it for what it is. I got it at a used record store anyway, didn't cost me much."
1,"Very, very poor","When purchasing this cd set, I expected the magnificence that is the movie soundtrack, all song with full orchestra. These cds sound as if all of the music comes utterly from a synth keyboard, which is most likely the complete truth. I wanted the real thing, and mistakenly bought a cheap imitation. If you enjoy synthesized orhcestrations, I'm sure you'll enjoy, butthis is as far from what I wanted as possible. I should have used more caution, and am going to attempt to return the cds. If you want The Lord of the Rings soundtrack, invest money in the offical soundtrack, as it was used in the movie, not this."
1,dont buy this set,even thought this is 23 dollars and 3 cds it is miss leading it is only performed by key board and some string intraments and is very well way off target
1,"Not a symphony, or an orchestra, but a synthesizer","Another viewer incorrectly stated that this was played by a ""medicore orchestra"" this is not an orchestra at all, it is a guy and his synthesizers. (who apparently goes by the code name: MASK""I would save the money you would spend on this and buy the 2 disc set from Silva with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Nic Raine, that is of course assuming you already have the original soundtracks and are looking for it being played by a different orchestra."
2,Yanni in chain mail,"I picked up these CDs, thinking that it was the orchestral soundtrack to LOTR. Not exactly.Upon listening to the contents, I noted that the recording sounded distinctly different from the orchestral music of the films. After closer inspection of the package, I see now that it is ""performed by Mask.""I have a feeling that ""Mask"" is basically one person armed with a battery of synthesizers. Listening to the CDs, I have this mental image of Yanni, outfitted in chain mail, giving a one-man keyboard concert from the highest level of Minas Tirith....Then again, Howard Shore's music is so strong that the CD's are not an entirely disagreeable listening experience. I find myself actually liking them at times, not for the synthesizer timbre, which is sometimes painful, but because they actually sometimes closely evoke the orchestral score.But really, if you want the LOTR soundtrack, get the orchestral recording, not this!"
4,Good Music Synthesis,"I was hoping that, since I already had the soundtracks, this cd would be different; and it was. All of this music was rewritten for a music synth. I liked hearing the computerized version of this music. But if you do not want this as a supplement to what you already have, just know that it really is the same music, just performed by computers. On some tracks it is hard to tell the difference, but on others it is obvious that the music is synthesized. Also, before you buy, read the track lists. There are a couple songs that MASK did not perform on this album."
1,A disaster,"Howard Shore's original soundtrack recordings for L.O.T.R. are my favourite music releases. This simply doesn't do them justice. The music appears to have been performed on a keyboard and most of the tracks are in the wrong order with several left out. Most tracks that are included just consist of part of the particular song being repeated; Into The West appears twice- presumably to use up space. The music itself is performed poorly- they make lots of mistakes with the tempo, etc. The singing, while bearable, is also pretty bad. I have a feeling they just wanted to take advantage of the popularity of the scores and make some easy money. Please don't be fooled into thinking you are going to get the soundtrack cheaper. I would strongly reccomend that you get the Complete Recordings boxsets if you really want to experience the true magnificence of these scores."
1,Incompetent,"Is William trying to emulate a Syd Barrett solo effort? If so, it didn't work. If not, he should stay away from the tape recorder when he's drunk. A complete waste of time for JAMC fans (or music fans, period). This is not even bad in a good or interesting way. Don't buy it, buy something else -- or make your own record, it will be better than this one!"
3,(oxy)moronic slacker-genius,"William Reid is like the kid who's obviously the smartest in the classroom, but just can't be bothered to ""apply himself."" On Finbegin, he's that kid, walking into finals 40 minutes late, stoned, and turning in a rambling paper which at the very least, is more interesting than the work of most of his peers. By far, not the worst album I've heard, but easily one of the most disappointing, because it could have been one of the best had Mr. Reid chosen to make a more focused effort."
1,Keshbel,"This stuff doesn't work, no matter if you follow the directions or not. Still came up positive. What a waste of money."
1,Waste of money,"This product was a total waste of money,,,,,,I used it twice and it did not work at all...I would suggest you just drink LOTS of water...and not waste you money on this ""product""IT DOESN""T WORK !"
4,hell mutha fuin yeah,"boom bang got it mang. gonna get a jobby and do my dam thang:) Pop snap, dog get back, slip slap i put my fat .. in yo flap"
4,"Birds, Birds, Birds!","This is a great field guide for people who enjoy birds that come to your feeders or in your yard. It is easy to use, organized into logical sections, and is as complete as most people would ever need. Some of the technical descriptions are odd since you can't truly describe ""sounds"" with words.I have a couple of bird books and I reach for this one nearly every time. Highly recommended."
5,Very useful and handy!,"Really needed a good (and easy to use) guide for our new bordering-on-the-woods house. We get tons of bird traffic at our feeders, and this book is organized well enough that I can quickly identify the species we see."
5,Birds of Eastern & Central N. America,Excellent Birds of Eastern and Central North America Field Buide by Roger tory Peterson. Was highly recommended by our Birding group in Mississippi. Very detailed for identification of birds. Books were in excellent condition when received.
5,No need to improve on this gem!,"When I lost my original copy of Roger Tory Peterson's ""Field Guide to the Birds"" in a cabin fire, I thought I might never find a replacement. When I saw this new edition available, however, I feared that it might not resemble the high-quality original, with Peterson's hand-drawn sketches and great reference maps. I am happy to report that this book is complete with it's original charm, sketches and maps included. It even has the coveted silhouette drawings on the inside covers! No need to change an already great reference book."
5,Birds in the back yard,I have found every bird I was looking for that has been in my yard this winter. I'm looking forward to new birds showing up once the weather warms up.
5,Great Field Guide,I ordered this when my husband got into bird watching. It is easy to use and I found it to be better than other field guides for people just getting started. I read a lot of reviews of different guides and this one got the best at the time that I purchased it. We have owned it for a few years now and keep it by our window where the bird feeders are located. We have not been disappointed.
5,small improvement--world of difference,"I previously carried an old edition of Peterson's because the pictures are more helpful for identification than those in any other field guide. However, it was a nuisance having to search through the range maps in the back of the book to see whether a bird could be found in a given location.In this new edition a miniature range map is printed next to the description of each bird on the page opposite the picture. (Full-sized maps are still located in the back of the book.) The new format is very helpful to those of us who don't already know the ranges of most birds. This very good field guide is now great."
5,Field Guide to Birds of Eastern & Central America,Best book I ever found on birds in Eastern and Central America. Excellent color photos.
4,A great game for the PSP,"If your a fan of RPG games, this will be a must for your PSP. Choose from 4 classes and your off for hours and hours (and hours ...) of role-playing fun! Enjoy!"
3,nothing to figure out,"All you do is kill; which I have no objection to as long as there's something else to do - secret pathways, buttons, puzzles - something in addition to the killing. Even Doom 1 had more than just killing. This game needs a bit more depth"
2,Not Impressed,"I never could get in to this game. I think the ""top down"" view just didn't seem right to me. Plus the graphics aren't all that great. This game basically fell into the large pit of boring PSP games that everyone complains about. I can't think of any redeeming qualities that this games possesses. It's just boring."
3,This is the Game that never ends!,"This is the first game I purchased for the PSP. I did enjoy it. For the first month I played it that is.The game does have some entertaining battles and quests. However, it just never ends.Every time I thought I finished the final quest, it suddenly generated nine more for me to complete.Don't get me wrong, I love the RPG and have always loved the Genre, but every epic must come to an end sometime.The quests began to get very tedious after a while. I felt like I was being forced to go here, now here, now go over there, now go back here, now go that away... you get the idea.I am happy I played it, but after three and a half months of near constant game play I had to eventually give up."
2,Way too easy,"I got this game a few months ago, and stopped playing after the first week. It's semi-entertaining in the beginning, when at least you die a few times and enemies are hard to kill. After level ten or so, it's just boring. I could kill pretty much anyone, including bosses, in under three seconds, rarely having to use health potions. Even the final boss wasn't hard. So if you enjoy running around hitting ""x"" as much as you can and watching people get mowed down...for 20+ hours of gameplay...buy this game. Otherwise, don't waste your money. The graphics are good, but they're really not that impressive. The storyline is dull, and the quests aren't engaging. Overall, this game just doesn't have much going for it."
3,untold is the story of this game,"Repetitive repetitive repetitive, but what can i say it is a good title for the PSP and won a place in my videogame lirary, I love rpgs and this is a fine game to get. I didn't like the graphics and the sound,but it is kind of fun but it gets BORING (spell it right) after a while, but you get new weapons and armor which is cool with over 20 hours of gameplay this is one you will like to take with you on long journeys."
5,very fluffy!!,"this gamwe is very fuun it is a good gaeme fr pspp!goode graaaficss?u begin in a cozy inn{called the howling pine inn}where u have to kill some spiders that r surounding this lady.then u go outside and kill more spiders.then u find overseer lesseta. she will tell u to rescue the crown{kaylee}from one of the catacombs.and the rest is history.at the end,u must kill 'the shadowed god'.he is really hard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THere is a guy that u can trade/sell with.there is an objective screen that will tell u wat to do.i strongly recomend this game for gamecube....just kidding,for psp!!!!"
2,Nothing special,Its an okay start on the psp for rpgs but its very boring fast. You constantly do the same thing which is. To go to some underground place and kill the boss. Thats all you do the entire game. This game is like its unfinished. It needs more to it not just constantly killing stupid bosses. The characters you can choose from arent any greater then the rest of them.
4,Great Game,"Now, I'm not a big fan of RPG's but, this one is very well done and entertaining. The story is a little boring and the loading is arduous. The screens are kind of cool though, but they get old fast. On the goodside, the game is addictive. Some of the enmies are original while some see to be just thrown in and unoriginal. The gameplay is good and the camera is easy to figure out. I just finished and I was never bored throughout the game. Very good , I reccomend it."
5,Dungeon slogging fun,Having just completed Dungeon Seige several times through and loving it. I would have to say that Untold Legends Brotherhood of the Blade is even a cut above. Unique classes to chose from with special abilities that add a little extra spice to the game. Some of the most tedius parts of RPGs are traveling back to town and inventory control. Untold Legends BOB makes managing these tasks less tedious than others. The game is fun and there is little to slow down the action. It is perfect for the PSP which is built for fast and fun gaming. I highly recommend this for gamers that love slugging there way through dungeons while watching there character develop.
3,"Fun at first, but ends up feeling like a bad hack and slash game as time goes on","This game has its moments, but ultimately this game just isn't that good of a game.At first the enemies seem vast, but like in your MMO's. You realize your basically killing the same spider or skeleton as you progress through the game. Only with them looking a bit different.If you have played Diablo you will be comfortable with this game. Its basically Diablo when you really get down to it."
3,review of untold legemds,this diablo clone as the only rpg available for the psp is a fairly fun adventure and quite long.there are tons of items to collect many of which are customizable.on the down side the enemies are all very similar and they are endless and they seem to progress in levels as you do so there is no sense of accomplishment as you gain levels and add slots to your powere tree.this game shouldnt be fun at all but it is. but u will quickly tire of the fetching missions and the endless waves of cloned enemies.
4,Not a bad launch title!,"Untold Legends is an RPG brought to us by Sony Online Entertainment, the same people that gave us Everquest, EQ2, and Star Wars Galaxies. While this game is not anywhere near as in depth as those games, it is a fun, light, roleplaying game, and the only one available at the launch of the PSP. It's really not even in the same vein as the afore-mentioned titles, and really owes a debt to Blizzard's Diablo line of games, as it plays nearly identical. Choose between 4 character classes, various modifications to appearance and skills, and off you go. The game offers quests and spells and dungeons to explore and equipment to loot and buy and sell, as well as providing fairly impressive graphics for a handheld game.Untold Legends is a perfect RPG for people like me, with a little time to kill on the train ride home, or late at night in bed when you can't fall asleep."
5,Good for digestive problems!,"I tried this product for occasional digestive problems and internal scarring. This product work wonders and helped my bowels become more regular. I feel overall better. My nails and hair are stronger. My skin is more soft and moisturized. This product is great for taken internally. I would recommend to family and friends!K.B.- Salt Lake City, Utah"
5,Lily of the Desert Aloe vera Juice,Although I was anxious to receive it it came is a reasonable amount of time. I use this in my moisturizing spritz mixture. I so love it and will be buying more of it.
1,Not a 6 pack -- only one bottle,"The description with the 6-pack on the picture is completely wrong. Beware, this is one bottle, not a 6 pack. Amazon should correct this asap"
4,i liked it!!,"what i liked is that this order shipped on time. also this product is good for many things, i use this for my hair to moisturize, and it does it very well. this is one of my favorite brands for aloe vera juice. thumbs up."
3,A Bit Messy But Weird and creepy Enough To Earn A Spot In My Collection!,"""The Clown Murders""(1976) featuring an early performance from a young and un-funny John Candy is one of those foggy oddball but some-what creepy films that only the 1970's could cough up. The film seems like it doesn't quite know what it wants to do with itself yet still manages to have a eerie feel to it that seems to consistantly grow throughout. The climax, even though pretty tame held up to todays standards(though all over the place as well) still makes you feel somewhat dirty & abused...like being forced to witness something that you shouldn't have.In the end a film like this may not be for everyone but for those of you who (like myself) really have a sweet tooth for those obscure lost 70's weirdy flicks ""The Clown Murders"" is pretty much a keeper."
2,The Down Murders,"The Clown Murders (1976) was a complete waste of time; vulgar, little point, no conclusion, simply terrible.The slow moving plot underwhelmed me. The situation of the characters was impossible to believe. I felt the only excitement of this movie comes when the Clown makes or attempts a kill. The dialogue was so unsatisfactory and the characters are set up to be generally hated. The dialogue was delivered like a bad soap opera show left on the cutting room floor. All of the actors should not have been hired.The characters are all one-dimensional caricatures (I know that's the point, it doesn't mean I have to like it though), the rambling, wandering story doesn't go anywhere, and when all is said and done, the movie doesn't even really end so much as it just stops.There is absolutely no redeeming value in The Clown Murders (1976). I really could not be entertained by it. One minute into the movie and I felt like turning it off.Skip the movie and a book."
5,Excellent Franco Jazz!,"This gives us a different side of Jess Franco. The musical aspect of his career. The jazz influences are felt throughout and it is easy to envision a younger Franco who moved to Paris and earned a living playing in Jazz bands. This is an awesome recording and really, in LP format it has that traditional sound that is sorely lacking in CD recordings."
2,recycled refuse,"It's advertised as b-movie jazz, and that's just what you get. But this album is comprised of re-recordings of original material, and as such sounds like retro-kitsch irony. Guess what? It sounds dreary."
4,Cave Reference Book,This book was a rusult of a Masters Thesis by the author. Printed by the Indiana Geological Survey in 1961. 128 pages soft cover. 58 figures & maps plus a comprehensive map of 398 known caves. Also known as Circular No. 8.
5,Great,"Bought one of these for my son and he raved about it, so much, that I am now getting one for us. My son says that his room always smells fresh and that the filters are easy to clean. My main reason for getting this one is the permanent filters. The air purifier that we have now has $35 replacement filters. No more of that!"
1,Poor Quality leather,The design of a bracelet is nice but a leather is soft and got damaged and scratched very easily.It is not what I have expected from $400 worth bracelet.
1,Primitive Overview of Methods to Commit Suicide,"A rather boring book with primitive methods to commit suicide. Although some people will be successful at killing themselves with the guidelines in this book, a lot of people will probably still botch their attempt at killing themselves."
4,"so far, so good!","I bought this (the ""Plus"" model, which has both electromagnetic and ultrasonic features) because I saw a couple of mice at my apartment. It's Day 5 now, and they haven't reappeared.It is quiet, nonpoisonous, and doesn't bother my cat. I put it where it is unobstructed, and secured it at one end of the room, per the instructions.This review will be updated within a month if it appears that the product is not working as expected but, so far, so good!"
5,It must work...,We have had probs in the past with mice in the house. Not this year. This product MUST have made the difference. This mouse-hater is mighty pleased!
1,Complete Waste of Money,"Even though one unit was theoretically enough for a house the size of mine, I bought two, just to be sure. I placed one at each end of the house. They've been up for over a week now, and while they haven't bothered the dog, they have apparently also NOT bothered the mouse/mice! We have had NO reduction in mouse sightings and mouse droppings. Time to go buy a case of mouse traps."
2,Interesting but outdated,"Helpful in general, but the information was outdated. For instance, we used it going to Kerrville: several recommended restaurants no longer existed, phone numbers were incorrect, etc. I'm sure this is normal with the passage of time, but you can't rely on the specifics."
4,"Very useful, but certainly not even close to all-inclusive.","I realize it's impossible to cover a century-and-a-half of performance practice in just over 600 pages, but I was disappointed to see the accompaniment of recitative virtually ignored. Given the numbers of operas by Mozart alone and the prevalence of secco and recitative accompagnato, I certainly expected some discussion - at least a paragraph! There really is NONE. There's an 8 page section termed ""Recitative Accompaniment"" and I got all excited when I saw it! But it only talks about the movement in the early 19th century to move away from using keyboard instruments to more cello and strings in general. I didn't need an expensive book to tell me that."
3,Tight fit,"I really like the look of these shoes. I read the other reviews - and reviews of this brand on other sites - before ordering so I ordered what I thought was one size too big. Turns out, it took a long time to break them in and they still scrunch my toes a wee bit. I'll take the pain though. They are super cute."
2,Not what I expected,I find these headbands a bit larger than I expected and they don't really help keep much of the sweat out. I will try a different brand next time.
3,"Too tight, not flexible enough","The band feels too tight and the material is not the flexible, terry material I expected. I do not recommend it."
4,I like trance more than house,"I thought this CD would be the best Ministry CD set ever. However, I was slightly disappointed. See, I like hardcore trance music a lot more than I like house. The first Cd was a disappointment. It is all house. However, Judge Jules spins some major trance on the second CD. It is my favorite Ministry CD by far. It is sooooooooooooooo intense. Every song fits in perfectly with the next. I definetely recommend the second CD."
5,Helpful Organization,This book is very handy and helps organize my beanie collection. Now I'm waiting for more supplements for the new beanies and teenie beanies. Can't wait to get them into my binder.
5,Review- Flight to Everywhere,This is an outstanding must have book for any aviation historian.The author skillfully puts you up close and personal with the maintenance and Aircrews of the USAF and ATCduring the crucial months of WWll.The book was written during WWll and is no longer in print so it must be ordered used. Mine arrived on time and in surpurb condition
4,Practical help for the insecure,"Those battling with feelings of insecurity and low self esteem will find several practical, helpful tips and a good dose of encouragement. My only complaint is, I wish the book was longer! It's brief size allows Joyce to merely skim the surface, but what's here is very good! Worth your money!"
5,Never Enough,I loved this movie because you can find ways to out smart the abuser. When you've had enough you will leave. I like the way she planned her escape. Maybe unbelievable to some but she went to great lengths to protect her and her child. I enjoy Jeniffer as an actress and is very good in this movie. Men who abuse women estimate them to be naive but the abuser has a surpruise coming.

5,Awesome,Wonderfully written...from the heart. Abigail has been to my Woodbury MN home to talk to a group about her experiences with gay dads. She is a powerful spokesperson for equality.
5,Great Book!!,"I had the good fortune of taking a data management class with Dr. Watson. He uses this book for an MBA level course on data management.He is an excellent teacher with a great sense of humor and it reflects very well in the way this book has been written.Even though I had known SQL well and also bits and pieces of data modeling prior to taking the class, this book put it all together very nicely.Data Modeling is taught from the perspective of a business analyst/manager. It covers virtually any type of business problem you may encounter and I guarantee that you won't find any more complex SQL queries in your real life than the ones this book covers at length. The SQL playbook is simply a great reference!!I would highly recommend it to any business student or executive who has anything to do with data management."
1,"Corrupted MP3 on Amazon MP3 store, do not buy","The track 'Strumming' is full of clicks and a loud crack at 03:21. I purchased and downloaded it twice just to be sure, same each time. Don't buy this album from Amazon."
2,Don't Bother,"I bought this radio for use in my office. The reception is poor and a get an almost constant annoying buzz from some kind of interference. I liked the idea of the weather alert but when its on standby, the alarm always seems to go off."
1,Light-turn-on alarm,"We have this product in our house, and I just ordered some replacements after finally having enough of this detector constantly going off for no reason.Among the things that set it off are:* turning on a light* walking by it* sleepingAmong the things that do not set it off are:* actual food being burned in the kitchenI would highly recommend buying this product if you want something which will scream at you at 80-90dB or higher that there is a carbon monoxide warning (of 0ppm) when you walk into your kitchen late at night and turn a light on. I especially recommend this product if you want to terrify your house pets and wake everyone trying to sleep for making the egregious error of turning a light on around it."
1,Total POS sounding constant false alarms,"Bought 2 at Walmart and both constantly sound false alarms. Spoke with First Alert and they provided instructions on how to disable the Infrared feature that could cause false alarms from florescent lights (have CFLs near by) or a TV remote. Not too confident this will solve the problem as some of the false alarms occur in the middle of the night when no lights or TVs are in use. They said they will replace the units if they still sound false alarms, but certainly don't want this particular model in return."
1,FALSE ALARMS,"Like the other reviewers, now in 3 days we've had 2 false alarms at ear piercing volumes (which is good if there was an issue). First was completely random, now today had a ""0 PPM Carbon Monoxide"" alarm at 630 AM when I flicked on the hall lights...thus waking up sleeping husband. PLEASE GET THESE OFF THE MARKET, FIRST ALERT. I don't care that you're so proud that you've never had a recall. How about you own up and start now????"
1,DO NOT BUY,"These horrible detectors go off constantly! If you open a nearby closet door, it goes off. Take a shower, it goes off. Turn on the light, it goes off. Please safe yourself the frustration and money and do not buy this product."
1,Warning: This alarm responds to ALL IR remotes,"WARNING: The SC07NC CO/Smoke detector has a feature where you can test the alarm using your IR remote control. It runs it loud a test ANY TIME you use your remote. There is no way to turn this feature off. The package does not mention this fact, though on page 3 of their user's manual, they state that you cannot install it where you use a remote. Be warned: Do not buy this remote if you use or plan to use a remote control in the same room.Beyond that, I like that it comes down easily with a twist of the product. Most products have this, too, such as the KIDDE Nighthawk.The product runs on two AA batteries. It does not have the ability to wire to house power."
1,The Malfunctioning Alarm,"I purchased this alarm for my condo about six months ago. The smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm are constantly going off for no apparent reason. The alarm has gone into test mode from my remote control. At 5 am this morning the fire alarm went off instructing me to evacuate my condo. There was no fire, causing me great early morning stress. Possibly I purchased a defective model, but needless to say I have removed the batteries and am looking for a replacement smoke alarm."
1,Potentially FATAL design flaw!,"We had a small fire on the stove that created a LOT of smoke, yet our ""First Alert"" SC07 smoke detector didn't activate! The batteries were brand new, and the unit tested fine just one month prior. Talk about a false sense of security!So why did it fail? Turns out, the ""slide out"" battery tray is a dangerously undependable design. The battery tray has no hard connection to the circuit board! Closing the tray is SUPPOSED to cause two chrome-plated wiper contacts to press against solder lands on the circuit board, but it's really just hit or miss.This kind of 'design'(?) may be fine in a toy, but for a safety device such a design is unconscionable. All it takes is a little bit of corrosion, a slight bend of the contacts, or a wobbly plastic tray, and the connection will fail suddenly at any time. And you'd never know it, especially since these kinds of failures tend to be intermittent.This thing is garbage."
1,Why Didn't I Read These Reviews First?,"I bought this stupid thing thinking the price and description indicated a good safe investment. I hung it on the wall near my computer. Occasionally it would wake me up in the middle of the night for no reason at all. I don't know if it was self-testing or just defective. I tried to get to it quick enough to figure out what the ""voice"" was saying, but I could never get to it in time. Today it went off and so did I. I smashed it to smitherines and threw it in the garbage. First Alert? Never again!"
1,My third replacement and still problems.,"Since six months ago I first bought this alarm. I have went through three replacements since then. Each alarm beeped three time fast which means ""replace alarm"" within the first month of operation. I call their support and they replace the alarm. Their support told me to try putting it in a different location which I did and within a couple weeks the replace alarm sounded again. I have a Kidde brand combination alarm just up the hall that I have never had a problem with."
1,"Zero stars for the surprise, automated testing feature","This detector goes into test mode in the presence of compact fluorescent bulbs. Not ""12 inches"" like First Alert whispers in the fine print. Half-way across the house. Flip the light switch at the top of the stairs, at the bottom of the stairs, BOOM!!!!! ""TESTING TESTING BEEP BEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""Zero stars for First Alert. Started out with six of these newly installed two months ago. Four have been ... shall we say ... removed. Easily a dozen false alarms or late night ""TESTING TESTING"" sequences.Nothing good about this product. Avoid like the plague."
1,AWFUL,"Someone thought it would be smart to include a feature that allows you to ""test"" this alarm by using any tv remote. Well, guess what - the alarm can't distinguish between when you're trying to test it, and when you're just trying to change the channel on your tv. Seriously! Not to mention the fact that it has false alarms all the time. The shrill voice screams ""warning, warning, carbon monoxide!"" and then it continues with the ridiculous announcement: ""carbon monoxide level is: ZERO!"" It makes no sense. Save your money."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!,"Worst smoke detector I've ever had the displeasure to use in my life, period! I thought, cool, it also detects carbon monoxide in the air. The cool factor wore off in the same day with it's constant, ""testing"". Every time we turn on a light near the alarm, the ""testing"" voice comes on, and what a whinny and indistinguishable voice it is! Truly a terrible product. I doubt this even works in case of a real fire! Do yourself a favor and skip this product. I will never buy anything from this company again!"
1,Ever get the feeling the designers are laughing at customers?,"This is so poorly designed that it can't be an accident. The designers must have been high, and are sitting around giggling at all the knuckleheads who bought this product. I'm being sarcastic, of course, but seriously, this is such a frustrating device that it's hard to believe a company would release this as a consumer product. Random alarms scare your family in the middle of the night, the battery tray is impossible to use, the connection of the batteries to the unit is hit-or-miss; all in all a piece of trash. Do some research and find a better unit...this is landfill waiting to happen."
1,False alarms/ Poor instructions,"Purchased this unit and had 3 false CO alarms within the first 10 days. Contacted First Alert and described the problem and they indicated the IR Remote testing function needed to be disabled. I did this and so far after 2 weeks there have been no false alarms. The unit was not near any remote controlled items and the alarms were going off at times when no one was using any remotes? They wouldn't explain the reason for this. Nowhere in the instructions is this cure for this problem mentioned. C'mon do we really need to be able to test the unit with a remote? Especially when it causes so many problems. This unit obviously went into production and is being sold to the public before all the bugs were worked out. I don't trust this product and purchased a Kidde unit and so far no problems with it. No more First Alert for me and btw, the parent company is BRK and they also sell under the names Family Guard, Tundra, and One Link."
1,"Unsafe piece of junk, and no help from the company.","I bought this to replace the one that was sending an 'end of life"" warning. Within a week it started going off in the middle of the night. Called the fire department. They couldn't find anything. Called the gas company. They couldn't find anything. I called First Alert and they knew about the problem. They had me disable the remote feature. Still went off in the middle of the night. After some arguing, they sent a replacement. It started going off in the night.I called to speak to a manager. Left a message, no call back. Left another message, no call back.This is worse than having no alarm at all because you don't react when it goes off. This product should be pulled from the market. It's unsafe."
1,this is AWFUL!!!! and should be recalled,"As many other reviewers have written, this is an AWFUL product. Good news for me--I didn't have to actually pay for it (my super installed it today.) Using a remote will trigger this terrible shrieking loud voice to scream, ""EVACUATE EVACUATE!!ZERO PPM CARBON MONOXIDE FOUND."" Like Titanic meets Hal from 2001 on ritalin. It's VERY VERY loud and annoying, aside from being defective. I had to literally fling myself across the room to dismantle it. Please recall this crap."
1,False Alarm,We had this unit for about a year before it gave us a major false alarm indication early on a Sunday morning. These detectors all seem to be total junk but this one is especially bad. The batter tray is also very poorly designed.
3,Goes off in the middle of the night,For the second time in a month the alarm has gone into test mode in the middle of the night when we are all asleep!
1,If a zero were possible I'd give it one,"Awful product. Our electrician put them all over our house when we did a remodel. It chirps, it screeches ""Warning! Evacuate!"" for no reason. The unit doesn't fit well on the piece that holds it to the ceiling. Some our our units require 9v batteries, others AA. Our units are hardwired into house.Not sure what the alternative is."
2,Remote control in smoke detector = capital design flaw,"I've owned this smoke detector for over 2 years and have finally given up on it. I only experienced one or two false alarms brought on by cooking (which I found acceptable), but it has caused me considerable hassle.The infrared sensor responds to any signal and is extremely sensitive. I've placed the unit out of sight on top of an armoire and taped over the IR sensor, AND STILL every now and then it would respond to a bounced-off signal from my TV remote (through a gap in the casing maybe). You need a strong heart to survive a movie night like that.I recommend theKidde Nighthawkinstead. Same feature set, no false alarms. Also looks better."
1,"WARNING, WARNING, Worst alarm ever.","I wish we had read the reviews before we purchased. We had these for about two years when suddenly one went off sending us into panic mode. Didn't know it kicked into test mode spontaneously as the voice is jarring and didn't hear it say testing. Opened the windows and brought the other detector down. Thought that the first one had malfunctioned as the second one didn't go off.Next day, the second one goes off but we heard the testing part. Still freaked out though because why would two detectors malfunction a day apart? Opened windows THEN read reviews here of identical experiences. Went out, bought a few Kidde detectors with digital readout -- zero CO detected.Save yourself the money and aggravation and don't buy this product! If I could give it zero stars, I would!"
1,Irritating waste of money,"Gives impromptu screeching ""tests"" whenever it feels like it. Battery replacement is very difficult. I have no idea if it actually detects smoke or carbon monoxide as I've taken it back."
4,I appreciate the consideration ...,"Even it's inexpensive, the item from Amazon arrives in extra packageto protect it from being bended. I appreciate the consideration."
5,Fantastic!,Was a little skeptical at first because I have seen similar products for double the money but with all the great reviews I knew I had to see for myself! I was not disappointed cards are in perfect condition! Although its not the best quality you can't really tell. And it looks awesome hanging with the rest of my memorabilia
4,"Best of the West, but flawed","This would have been better as a single disk CD, since so many of the tracks on disk 2 are remixes of tracks from disk and there are a couple of stiffs that could have been deleted. Still, this does collect the best West Coast rap of the 1990s. The best of what's here (Dre, Snoop, 2Pac) overlaps heavily with ""The Chronic"" and ""Doggystyle"". This is a good sampler if you don't have those CDs, but the tracks do hang together better in their original context. Remastered sound is great."
4,Hey Wait... Is That Yazoo?,"That's what I first thought when I heard ""Who Needs Love Like That"" on KISS FM in Los Angeles back in 1985. Well I was half right. Vince Clarke (half of Yazoo) was now making music with a certain Mr. Andy Bell, and I liked it. The album wasn't out yet so I bought the 12"" and wore out my record player. When the album finally came out, I listened to it over and over again. There's no doubt that this album was a bleed over from Yazoo to Erasure (I'm sure this was more of Clarke's baby since he was the one who hired Bell). Erasure hadn't quite found their true sound yet 'til ""The Circus"". That's why I give the album four stars. All of the songs are great. But they do sound like Yazoo, and although that's not a bad thing, it's not really who or what Erasure really were. If you can find the U.K. version, get that one! It includes ""Push Me Shove Me"" and ""Pistol"" which are great songs."
4,an excellent debut...,"This is the CD that started it all for Erasure. Definitely a treasure of catchy tunes. The most outstanding track is ""Oh L'Amour (The Funky Sister's Remix). Now THAT song brings back memories!"
1,"'Wonderland' remastered yet ""Push Me, Shove Me"" remains unfaded","There were track variations between the original UK and USA versions of 'Wonderland'. The UK LP contained the ""Who Needs Love (Like That)"" single b-side ""Push Me, Shove Me"", which was a track not included on the USA edition. On the original UK CD release of 'Wonderland', there was a mastering defect where the song was not faded out as it did on the UK LP. When I heard this album was being remastered I had my hopes up that this annoying glitch would be corrected. No, it wasn't. ""Push Me, Shove Me"" is AGAIN not faded out and the song abruptly stops cold.Thankfully after ripping this CD to MP-3, I took ""Push Me, Shove Me"" into a sound editing program to properly fade out this song, something that SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE during the remastering process. It's sad when I have to manually correct a job that someone at EMI got paid to do. Chalk another one up for quality control."
1,How low will America go ?,Using kids for the propaganda purposes should be declared as a war crime. I rest may case.
1,Zero stars,"If a score of zero was an option, this book would deserve it. It's either a fake, or written a very long time after the events. There is no feeling whatsoever of immediacy. There are only minimal cultural references - and these are simplistically explained for the dumb reader. It's painfully obvious that this so-called ""diary"" was written explicitly for a gullible, Western audience. If it were authentic, it would have far more cultural references, and it would have been full of footnotes. Weak. Shallow. Just awful."
3,Thura's Diary is very insightful!,"Thura's Diary by Thura Al-Windawi is the diary of a nineteen year-old girl living in Iraq during the Iraqi War. She tells about changes in her life once American soldiers entered Iraq. Thura describes how she feels and what she sees during wartime Iraq. Also she explains changes for women. For example during the war especially women were being kidnapped if they weren't wearing a headscarf.This book is really enjoyable and as a high school student it was really easy to connect with Thura. Thura's Diary gives you an idea of what it's like to live in a wartime country. Her book contains a lot of social value especially for Americans because you receive an idea of what is actually happening in Iraq from a young Iraqi woman's perspective. Like Jem in To Kill a Mockingbird Thura also realizes that she has to grow up to be strong for her seven year-old sister, Sama. This book is a good quick read and deserves three stars."
1,Disappointing.,"I do not wish to trivialize the war experiences that Iraqi's have suffered. However, this book does not do justice to the many situations faced by war survivors. The book is trivial, poorly written, and has very little insight into the motives and effects of actions taken during the war."
3,didn't fully connect with Thura,"This is the journal of a young Iraqi woman in her late teens writing about what she and her loved ones went through during the ""shock and awe"" bombing of 2003. The writing was dry and I didn't fully connect with Thura--I wasn't sure if it was because feelings were lost in translation or if Thura's writing is naturally dry. The style didn't impact me emotionally, although I can still appreciate the book for it's gritty realism."
1,Bad book,"This is the most shallow, superficial 'diary' I have ever read. No emotion, no detail, nothing. For what this girl supposedly went through, she seems pretty nonchalant. If you want to read a book that describes the war in Iraq with some real emotion, try ""What Was Asked of Us...An Oral History of the Iraq War by the Soldiers Who Faught It."""
2,A complete disapointment,It is a book for laboratorial use and I was expecting an enginnering approach; for me it is absolutely useless
3,Good Whisk for Light Duty,"This is a good quality tool for making gravy, sauces, and light roux. For a dark roux that takes a long time stirring at high heat to get just right, like for a large batch of Cajun gumbo, I would prefer a longer, heavier-duty whisk with a handle that does not conduct heat."
2,Not very high quality - very lightweight - maybe okay for the price.,"I was hoping that this would be more substantial. If you need this type of whip you may find it acceptable at its $10, or so, price point."
5,Greatest album,I bought this years ago and wore it out in college... obviously you can see from all the reviews this is fabulous... good CD to buy to get a taste of DW. He rocks!!!!!!!!1
4,I'll be back,"A classic country rock album!More country than rock and that's how I like it!Perfect to listen while driving on an open road or at home with your mama or some good ol' friends.Guitars, cadillacs and MARIA Mc KEE(duet with dwight on track"" I can't remember and the cd is all the way upstairs"")...And the song Guitars, Cadillacs etc... I thought I knew that song!Of course ""I need your boots, your clothes and your motorcycle"".It's nothing personnal but it's damn good!"
5,Revolutionary album...,"When Dwight Yokum released ""Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc."" in 1986, country music was struggling. The Nashville Sound and pop influences had diluted country to the point that many people couldn't tell the difference anymore. Dwight was among a group of traditionalists who reminded people what country music was.This album belongs in the collection of anyone who calls themselves a country music fan. It is great from ""Honky Tonk Man"" to ""Heartaches By The Number"". It is simply a masterpiece. Dwight shows tremendous range and proves that he can sing a ballad such as ""South of Cincinnati"" as good as anybody in the business, but he can also honky-tonk with anybody. It's a great record."
1,Would have been super good...,"if it played in my DVD player. Amazon has is listed as being region 1. When I received my disk, I looked at the back and it stated region 2,3,4,5. Where was the region 1 disk that I ordered???Buyer beware. If you enjoy returning orders, this is the DVD for you!!! Enjoy."
3,Pretty Good for making your own frappacinos,Pretty good for making your own frappacinos. But I am almost over using it. It is not enough of the dark chocolate flavor that I prefer. So I am going back to using syrup when I finish this third can.
2,"Dolomite, really?","I've been using dolomite for years, and when I have pain, it usually works quite well. This product didn't even touch the pain, at the doses prescribed. I even took extra, just in case. Not sure what's in it."
3,"Nice music with annoying ""nature""","The disk has just Pachelbel's Canon, as stated, and the piece repeats several times to fill up the typical listening time of a CD. That was fine, and the music was well done, but I found all the dubbed ""nature"" sounds annoying. Some people enjoy that, and if you're one of them you would enjoy the music."
5,GREAT TAPE - EVEN BETTER WITH ACTIVATOR,Great tape but it is amazing with an activator. I bought an activator pen but they also sell pads. I have used this combo to secured marine battery holders to the bottom of boats. Super strong with the activator.
2,not strong at all,"I bought this molding tape thinking that it was going to be stronger than what I've been purchasing from the store, this tape is not sticky at all. I have a Sirius portable radio/mp3 player that I've been trying to attach to the side of my console. The player comes with a car kit that has a sticky side that you stick to the console, well that wore out in this Texas heat so I've been trying to find a strong adhesive that would hold the player in place. My vehicle is garage kept and I don't keep it outside longer than I have to. All the adhesives work for a few months then comes loose; this one didn't make it 1 day, I found my player on the floor a few hours later. I'm going to take my car to a stereo shop and see what my other options are. As far as this tape goes maybe I was sent an old role or it's just not that good."
4,works for my go pro mount,I was seeking a wider tape but this works for now its a decent size. I use 3 small strips to cover it and it resticks like new.
1,Really not good...,"Well I'm not sure what happened to my roll.. maybe I just got a bad one but this tape was utter crap. I used some to attach a ballast, it came loose within an hour. to test it, I attached a piece of plastic to the wall using it. tapping the plastic would cause it to fall.Would not recommend."
2,Definitely Not For All Uses,"I used this to reapply the plastic tank decals on my motorcycle, after cleaning with denatured alcohol. The adhesion was OK for about 3 months, then it started coming loose again. Perhaps this tape is OK for larger applications where more of it can be used to hold molding, etc. on vehicles, but not suitable for smaller, more detailed cut applications."
3,Plant Dinosaur,"I gave it three stares because it had parts of other video's I have of Dinosaur's. There is some new parts, still a keeper and not a send back. If this was a first time video of Dinosaur for me it would be a good one. I just hate getting these and finding parts of other video's in them.This rating is for the one's that made the video , not the one's that sold it."
5,"Kids love this video! Good for adults, too!","I purchased this video at a store for a five year old boy that requested to watch it over and over. I then bought a 2nd copy through Amazon and gave it to a six year old girl with the video again becoming a favorite. It is also very easy on adults who consequently have to now see it over and over. The BBC did a fantastic job with the graphics, and they present the material in a similar manner to their ""Planet Earth"". The material is fascinating and enlightening as much of it was new to me. It is narrated by John Hurt."
4,Could be should be blu-ray,"BBC did it again with outstanding graphics and story. This is by far the best I've seen......BUT...... I can only view in in standard DVD format. BBC has not released it in the USA in blu-ray, only in Europe. I originally ordered the blu-ray that advertised for ""all regions"" to find that was not true and had to return it. I hope the BBC has plans to share this wonderful display of dinosaurs in blu-ray with the rest of the world."
1,couldn't finish it,"I found the Pope's Daughter to be an incredibly detailed book about an era that didn't interest me. It was a book club selection and I literally couldn't finish it. If you are a historical fiction reader, you will get your fill of facts. I never got to the story."
4,The Pope's Daughter,Wonderful story about a strong woman and a time in history which I know ittle. Highly Recommend this book.
5,For history buffs,"A richly written in-depth detailed biogarphy of a remarkable, astoundingly resourceful and powerful woman in 16th century Rome. Caroline Murphy takes you physically and emotionally back to those ancient times. Well worth reading especially for one who loves Italy."
4,Brings history to life,"Fascinating to have documented evidence of the exercise of power in the past. Makes one thankful for our egalitarian society but,also, wish that sometimes issues might be dealt with as speedily as in pre-democratic times. I guess we can't have it both ways.A good read overall. I learned quite a bit about the papacy & the excesses which provoked the reformation."
4,TANTALIZING,"Caroline Murphy has sketched an extraordinary life. Felice della Rovere's worlds -- personal and political -- were complicated ones, and she seems to have been amazing in how she negotiated them. I say ""seems"" because it's very often difficult to tell whether the author is basing a statement on solid evidence or whether she is taking a leap -- about an action, about a motivation, about an emotion -- a sort of best guess based on the evidence. That's often frustrating and often downright irritating, but all in all it's worth it to see the shape, if not the real substance, of the life."
5,The Pope's Daughter,"This is an interesting and scholarly work by Caroline P. Murphy about Felice della Rovere, the daughter of Pope Julius II. Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel. Felice was nearly lost to history but in the time of the Italian Renaissance, was a powerful woman in her own right. This is a fascinating study about an equally fascinating woman."
4,Interesting story set in the Renaissance,"Historical books can be fun reads and this one proves it. After reading this book and the other in the same time period, I feel like I know the Renaissance better especially the social structure and daily life. Felice della Rovere was an important woman of her time and she led a life that was so much more than you'd have guessed for a woman of that time."
1,Illegal Gimmick,"This wedge is just a gimmick, the face that has reversed grooves is illegal in tournament play. Not only that but no wedge can teach you how to spin, that's something only a PGA professional can show you with adapting your stance, swing, and release. Sure if you want this club to joke around then fine, but it is cheating and it will chew up any ball you try to hit with it.Playing in local and state tournaments is fun and challenging but even if you don't play tournament golf, then you should at least be honest and play by the rules.If you want a club with a replaceable face, then consider the TaylorMade xFT wedge. You can find awesome deals on xFT wedges being sold for $60 with one face. I got mine with two faces for $40 new from an authorized retailer.There are many other options for wedges that use the new legal groove design, and most of those options are well under $60."
3,Book review,"This book is based on a survey of I think 100,000 people. I read it with my family and we laughed on how accurratly it was discribing the family. Although, it is very accurate, everyone is different and it does have a few misshaps for each blood type.It tells you what kind of person you are based on your blood type.It seems to be the best personality profile that we have had in a long time. I do reccomend this book for others to read."
1,find a better way to spend 2 hours,save your money.almost anything is a better use of time than to watch this poorly written movie.The dialog and plot are so thin and unbelievable so as to pose continuity and coherence issues to the audience.besides that it isn't even a decent love story or action flick.strikes out on everything it attempts.big waste of time.
1,97 edition poor,"This atlas has less detail than others I've used,and is particularly lacking in information andmaps of individual states. You can do better.I had the 1997 edition."
2,Too much information,"This book offers a very comprehensive look at microbiology and virology (with some immunology and parasitology thrown in); unfortunately, that's not a good thing if you're trying to study from it. The chapters are full of information on lab values and other minutiae that will be of interest to only those who make a living in the field. Otherwise, you'll have to search hard to pick out the relevant details that are worth remembering. There are definitely better, easier to use books on the market than this one"
1,"Inaccurate, Incomplete by Ten Years and Unathorized!","This spurious bio ends in 1997, though it copyrights itself as 2004. It is not only incomplete, it contains a number of inaccuracies. I consider myself a reasonable authority, as it's my bio!"
4,"[Inexpensive], compact and pretty darn thorough","This is a great [inexpensive] little dictionary. The only thing holding back a star from this one is that it doesn't lend much help on verbs. A few pages on verb conjugation basics tacked on the end would make this essential, especially for travelers. Good buy. Good bye. hehe!"
3,good. could be better.,"This is a good product ... save the fact that within 1 week of owning it, the male XLR out busted. When I connect a female xlr, the male connector popped into the unit. I had to open it, and reseat the xlr connector in the box.I closed the DI back up, connected the xlr, and BAM ... happened again.other than that ... it's a good product."
3,Rengoku,"It is a interesting little game, made as a simple little adverture game. Though it got three stars because after a while the game play gets stale"
3,"It's Ok, But Flawed","The second game is much better, but this is still fun! It doesn't deserve such a low rating, but let be known this is no masterpiece. It's much more difficult than its predacessor and the enemies aren't as balanced. The bosses are near impossible for first-time action gamers, but players familiar with hardcore psp games won't be scared. If you love robots and weapons its a great game."
1,Only rented it and I still feel cheated,"Wow. The intro movie got me excited. Neat robots with guns mounted in their foreheads. And then there's the gameplay. It's been said in other reviews--room after room of boxes and opponents. I can't remember playing such an un-fun game. Too bad, as it's one of the only true originals for PSP. Avoid at all costs."
4,Can be addicting,"I originally picked up this first version of the game used with some trepidation from various reviews and comments from game stores. I wasn't expecting very much, however, what I found was a totally addicting fighting game.As you progress through the game you become more adept at what weapons to carry and use.I liked the game enough that after I finished it, I purchase the sequel and recently completed it also."
5,a gentle on the skin cream,I love this cream. I have sensitive skin and this cream does not irritate it at all.
2,Not so great,"I really like the green fig soap, but the accompanying lotion does not smell as good. All I could smell was green peppers and celery. I will continue to purchase the soap, but the lotion is not for me."
5,Love these earrings,"Nice quality, look great and comfortable to wear. Perfect for a little dangle with a beach theme ! Love them ! They are not heavy."
3,"pure white color, good coverage, not good for line work","good pure white color, covers well. mixes well with all other colors.difficult to use for clean lines & accents, texture is think. thinning with more water is not enough."
4,My Main Problem is (Im)Patience,"What I need is is a solid week to let myself enjoy this book's method.I originally read the 1st edition, and bought this highly revised edition.One telling line from the first edition that is missing: ""I would look at what I wanted to draw until 'that' happened, and then I would draw ..."" Dr. Edwards describes this as the left brain-right brain shift.Whatever.I only know that, until it happens, my drawing style resembles stickmen. Afterwards, I think I might have a chance.My only (personal) problem is that my own mind is time-centric, and regulated by its own internal clock.What I really need it to take this book and sketching supplies, and find a week to learn to relax again. The following week I'll pick up the pencil and let my overactive, speaking mind have a holiday and I'll draw.Left brain/right brain. The parlance was set three decades past. Use this book to truly see, and technique will follow.Recommended."
4,It's good!,Jack Higgins (Harry Patterson real name) has has a long and very successful writing career. This novel is no exception to the bulk of his fine work. The story is about a paid assassin who is also a concert pianist and to say more would spoil the plot for the reader of this fine novel. Buy it!
3,"Good, But...","I enjoyed the reading this book just as I had enjoyed ""The Eagle Has Landed"". However, I was disappointed to find the exact same gangster scene in both books. How does a publisher let this happen??? Other than the reaccuring IRA them in both books, the story plot is different. I'm hesitant to ready another book of Higgins for fear I may have to read the same scene for the third time."
3,"NOT HIS BEST,NOT HIS WORST","HE IS GETTING TOO PREDICTABLE, SAME TYPE OF CHARACTERS, SAME STORY LINE, SAME VILLAINS FROM PREVIOUS BOOKS.HE NEEDS A FEW NEW TWISTS IN THE STORY, A FEW MORE DOUBLE CROSSES ,ETC.ITS IS SOMEWHAT TIRESOME FOR MORE OF SAME OLE, SAME OLE.OVERALL A TYPICAL HIGGINS."
5,solo,"Great book, read it when it first came out in the 80's. Great then even better now.jack Higgins is the best."
1,Didn't finish,"I have read Jack Higgins before, but this was so slow I couldn't stay interested. I didn't finish the book."
1,Solo,NEVER RECEIVED THE DOWNLOAD OF THIS BOOK -- sOLO. SO UNABLE TO GIVE A COMMENT. WHY WAS IT NOT RECEIVED ON MY KINDLE
4,A DIFFERENT JACK HIGGINS,I thought this was a very interesting tale. We meet a brilliant concert pianist who moonlights as a hit man and is also a fascinating lover. Quite a career path! We also meet Brigadier General Ferguson at an early age before his Sean Dillon-era. The way the story unfolds keeps you interested throughout. I definitely recommend it.
3,SOLO by Jack Higgins,"Another fascinatic story by Jack Higgins. This book ,like all the others by Higgins, is hard to put down. You just want to know how the story will end and as always there is a suprise ending to the story"
3,Meh,Things have come a long way. Must have been a solid template for simplier days of long ago... Good read as a predecessor to today's faster paced and techo-savvy thrillers.
3,Not up to expectations,"Not a bad book, but not nearly as good as most of Jack Higgins' other books. In this book you sort of always knew what was going to happen. Jack Higgins wrote many very good books. This is not one of them."
4,"I read ""Solo""","Another good suspense yarn from Jack Higgins - couldn't put it down. Character development a little on the dull side, but worth the time it took to read the book. I've been reading this author for years and some of the enjoyment from this book is surely nostalgic."
3,Is it a reprint?,"Very strong feeling I have previously read this novel. It was an entertaining read, albeit very predictable. Geographic setting's were particularly well defined."
3,A Little Contrived,"Jack Higgins is one of my favorite authors, ever. I think I've read every one of his books -- so I had a lot of points of comparison for Solo. Solo was just OK, a decent story with interesting characters, and, as always with Higgins, well written.But it was a small twist on what's become the Higgins formulaic approach. That, combined with too many convenient coincidences to help move along a plot that in reality would be so twisted that no investigator would make progress, made it less than the author's best work.If you're a fan of the genre, it won't really disappoint you to read this book -- but don't expect to be ""wowed."""
4,Solo,"I always read any book by Jack Higgins, ""Solo"" is good entertainment. He develops his characters so well in each book."
3,Good read,"I enjoyed this book, and thought it was pretty well written, but I didn't LOVE this book which is why it got three starts. Would probably do 3.5 if possible. I liked the characters and the book kept a pretty good pace because it really spans the life of a Mikali and his adventures. The reader gets to see how Mikali became what he is, and I personally actually liked the character. I did not however, like the ending. I figured how it would end, and I won't ruin for anyone, but I was still disappointed. Overall it was a good book and I enjoyed it."
4,Enjoyable but Kindle version replete with minor errors,"This was a perfect ""airplane trip"" read and although not the best Higgins, a good read nonetheless. The only down side would be the numerous small typos and other errors in the Kindle version (e.g. ""1"" for ""I""; repeated words in some places). Poor editing derails one's train of thought as a log on the track. As a $1.99 daily special, though, you really can't go wrong."
3,Solo,"The book is typical Jack Higgins. It was an enjoyable read, but he has done better.I will continue to read his books, but it is just not his best."
5,Solo is one of Jack Higgins best!,"I've read many Jack Higgins books, and this is by far, one of my favorites!While it's a quick, easy read, it's also packed with action and thrills. I could not put it down.I personally don't like reviews that are so long they give away the plot...so with that in mind: The characters are well developed and the story has you traveling all over the world. I do have to say I was somewhat disappointed on how easily the criminal was pin pointed and caught out.Overall, a well written and wonderful story that I truly enjoyed. Hope this review helps!"
3,"Started out great, then fizzled.","Was really interested then about halfway through, it seemed to jump/bounce around so much it was hard to keep up...not a big fan."
3,Downloaded from Amazon to my iPad ... Which works great.,I downloaded it to my iPad while on vacation and found it an interesting read. I have not read Higgins before so have nothing to compare it to. I am also a pianist and classical music fan so that held my interest. It is a good quick read. Maybe not a great piece of literature but I could recommend it.
2,Stilted,"If you are a fan of 50's/60's style thrillers you may like this Higgins formula driven ""Solo"". If you are tired of all the old (and silly) stereotypes of the Irish, English and other European nationalities, leave this one alone."
4,Solo,An exciting but subtle thriller that keeps you guessing. The plot was engrossing and the characters interesting and well developed.
3,"Better graphics, a bit short...","When I first purchased this movie, I was thinking that it would be a new age version of its predecessor. I was correct, but there were a bit changes in the plot that I don't want to spoil for you.The storyline was interesting, a miniature love story, though it's questionable if you can love someone who has raped you...(just a small hint).No, Amano Jyaku's red-blooded sister isn't in it ::sigh::.You will still love Amano Jyaku, but I think he is cooler in the other ""Legend Of The Overfiend"" works.The ending was good, but it makes you wish there was more to it. Like you ask yourself the age-old, ""What happens next?""It's still a good trilogy, one that any fan should own. It won't put you to sleep. But you'll find that it could have been better...::sigh::"
5,Anime,I love anime. I wish that they show a little more than they did but it was good. I would like to get more of this series.
4,A Medium For Murder,Mrs. Charles is the main character in A Medium For Murder. She believes that she is psychic and uses a crystal ball to tell people their future. Most people thought that she was really odd and didn't like her until they need to find out who murdered Miss Player. I liked this book a lot. It had a lot of passion and made me want to keep reading it. The characters were interesting and I could relate to some of the characters problems because the author went into so much detail. This was a really good mystery book.
2,He needs the Time....,"This is a marginal effort. Many of the songs just sound too similar to each other, and Morris shows very little of the creativity that drew us to the Time. His vocals are as solid as he can get (considering he can't really sing), but the music is terrible.If you get this, it'll surely disappoint."
4,"Great sound, great music, manic camera work","I have to disagree with one of the previous reviewers regarding the sound on this recording. I found the sound to be superior to the ""Live in Paris"" DVD which has a consistent echo throughout the performance. I'm sure this was just an acoustic anomaly from the concert hall, but it's still distracting when listened to on head phones. This new DVD however has excellent sound.The only complaint I have about it is the frantic camerawork throughout the concert. There are so many camera angles fading in and out that it gets tiring to watch. I just wished that the camera would sit still for at least 10 seconds. I get the feeling that it was directed by someone who has only directed 30 second commercials.Of course, the music is terrific and includes all the new tunes that weren't on the Paris DVD. I also prefer the quartet sound to the full orchestra from the other disc."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I know I'm in a minority, but though I'm a big fan of Krall, Wilson and Erskine , I found this release disappointing and inferior to the sublime Paris concert. Not because of the material--which is ok- but because of the production and performance. The former is spoilt by silly camera hyperactivity and a less than great sound quality.Regarding the performance, Krall seems to go for technique too often rather than content--and her vocals are sometimes tired sounding with intonation lapses.Wilson has his moments,but I prefer the sound of the older instrument he used in Paris.Hurst has plenty of chops but seems bored for some of the time and frankly the Hurst/Erskine axis doesn't swing as much as the Clayton/Hamilton pairing. (Compare their respective versions of All or Nothing and East of the Sun) Notwithstanding the above, I'll still eagerly await DKs next project..."
3,Video for the MTV generation,"I attended this concert and the music was superb. However, the cameras were very intrusive (at one point a camera on an extended boom was about three inches from the keyboard. Whenever I tried watching the concert on the large screens I was distracted by the quick camera changes. If the video editing had been better, the DVD would have rated a 5. Foretunately I had a good seat stage right in the balcony and could see well without having to watch the screens too many times. I found the remote camera on a rail that was set up along the front of the screen almost as distracting as the two boom cameras set up on stage. Her songs with Elvis Costello were a pleasant surprise. If you want to hear the music, buy the DVD and listen to the music, skip watching the video."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I enjoyed ""Diana Krall: Live in Paris"" very much, but the montreal jazz festival is poorly constructed. Peter Erskine and Robert Hurst weren't as good or enthusiastic as Jeff Hamilton and John CLayton. Diana rushes on a few songs, such as ""East of the Sun"" and ""Devil may care"" Also, the camera couldn't keep still for more than 5 seconds, and it gets very irksome to watch after a while."
1,Get Back To the Old Goodies,"This CD stinks Diana is at her best doing the old evergreens like on ""The Look of Love"" and ""live in Paris""."
3,"The music is well played , but Diana is not on vocal form","I already own the LIVE IN PARIS DVD by Diana , which I love and play often .I bought this new one , hoping for a similar experience , but it was not to be .She sounds tired and off key - maybe her schedule is a bit full these days . Her musicians are very good , as expected .The blues number at the end , LOVE ME LIKE A MAN , is the only one which really catches fire .May I recommend the LIVE IN PARIS DVD if you don't have it already .If you do , try renting this first if possible .I don't play it much and will probably trade it ."
1,Terrible,"I got this DVD after i saw Diana Krall live in Paris. This disc is nothing compared to Live in Paris. The camera switches shots every half second. I even saw a person in the crowd shaking his head!! This concert seems to be low budget. They did not have an orchestra. There was only 4 people. They couldn't even get a chair for the guitar player!!! I think Jeff Hamilton and John Clayton is much better than Peter Erskine and Robert Hurst. Peter Erksine is pretty bad at brushes, and Jeff Hamilton is phenomenal at brushwork. I do not recommend this DVD. Get the live in Paris instead if you have not gotten that one."
2,Try Peggy Lee instead,"I agree: the rapid cutting is annoying. This is supposed to be a jazz concert, not a rock concert.Also, I don't get these songs, either. Pretentious stuff, it seems to me. The woman can play the piano, but her singing is lacking.I say give Peggy Lee a listen, try Shirley Horn, Billie Holiday, Dione Warwick, Etta James, Dalida, Jeane Manson, Kelly Flint (of Dave's True Story), Nana Mouskouri, Dusty Springfield, Carmen McRae...I could go on."
2,"A Passycat, Not a Tiger",Diana had some excellent albums when she was singing standards andcabaret music. Elvis seems to have convinced her that they can both write their own stuff. Not true.
2,EEEEEHHHH ---,"I,too, am a big fan of Diana-- That being said, I thought ""Freak Out"" was just that. There is a similar set on the ""Live in Paris"" album that is much more coherent. Enough can't be said of the skills of the bassist and the drummer, but I'm sure that Diana could come up with a more creative guitarist. As to Krall/Costello creations, I didn't expect Joni Mitchell. I think that an album on the general line of those compositions would be great. I would rather have more standards/straight ahead jazz at the - after all - jazz concert. While I'm not from the fashion police -- Diana -- Please ! Get a hair cut !"
1,Diana Krall-Live at the Montreal Jazz Festival,"I love Diana Krall and own every CD, VHS, and DVD she ever made BUT, this one is not up to her usual standards. Very boreing and found myself 'fast forwarding' to find something of interest. Sorry Diana. But will be looking forward to your next try."
2,Switch failed after 9 months,"I've been using mine constantly for many months and it is really solid. There's just one thing I would like different that I can't find in any other product on Amazon: I want the hook to swivel! Most of the time when I hang this lamp using the hook, the light is not pointing where I need it. Often I can get by, but sometimes the hook cannot be used at all.Update: the switch failed after 9 months. It is molded in and not repairable. Changed from 5 stars to 2 stars."
4,A great book for any teen girl!,"Sierra's friend Paul is coming from home from Scotland, butthen Sierra hears about his plane crashing. As you can imagine, shefreaks out and is sure he's dead. You'll just have to read it to find out how it all works out. The whole time you're like ""Ahh! Where on earth is Paul? "" You'll love this whole series. if you just read this one you won't get it, so read the whole series after the Christy Miller series. I'd definitely recommend this book."
1,poorly made,This toothbrush holder is poorly made. It didn't last 3 months and being an online purchase it wasn't worth the hassle of a return. The porcelain dish is epoxied to the metal base. It was assembled crooked and eventually fell off and broke. The holes in the holder are not big enough for any of my toothbrushes. I like the design but wasted my money on this junk. Very disappointed.
3,Bushwacker Fender Flare Installation,The design and concept of the flare is great. When the product was received the packaging was excellent and assembly parts were all there. The front flares went on very nicely and everything fit well. It was a very quick installation. The experience with the rear flares was not as good. Both rear flares were approximately two-three inches to long on one end. This meant having to cut a slot in the flare so that it would fit tighter against the fender. It still left a wider gap and the flare protruding below the body metal. This was the end that had the curved rollunder so it would not have looked better to have just cut it off. It was supposed to fit the fender. This also made it necessary to drill new mounting holes.
5,Three feel-good stories!,"Dick Francis is a master of the do-the-right-thingnovel! If you're looking for intriguing storylines, believable characters and cover-to-coverracing, you'll love these three novels"
4,Fun tube for the kids,"This is a great tube for kids and those who are not looking for an aggressive tube. The tube sits rather high in the water which can make for a difficult time getting on from the water but once on it gets out of the water and on plane in a hurry. The open deck design allows for you to sit on or in the tube and the handles are comfortable. At around 60-70 bucks this is a great beginner to intermediate tube.Pros. Price, ride, comfort, open deck, quick to plane out.Cons. No quick connect, can be hard to get on from water."
3,170 pound weight limit,I like this towable but the description doesn't say it has a max weight of 170 pounds. My husband and son-in-law can't use it since they are over the limit. Luckily I bought it mainly for my grandkids and they love it.
3,Okay but not great,"Not a bad book, but there are other books out there that are much better at teaching the moral ""The best gifts are those that we give""."
3,A true classic,Of course every little kid loves puppies the paper is easily ripped though especially with the little hands this book was meant for.
3,Ellis Peters meets Robert Ludlum,"Kooky sort of combination of a modern CIA sorta novel in an Ellis Peters setting. The book works on the odd idea of an international society of professional agents who are also jesters, working for Truth, Justice and, well, the Catholic Church. If you can get past all that with a shrug, Gordon has written a pacey little book that doesn't bog down, has some really good dialogue scenes and has the felicity to turn its own pages. The hero is sort of over-the-hill James Bond who drinks too much, but is fun to follow. If you don't have a high tolerance for anachronism, though, this book will drive you nuts (such as when our hero explains that lead-based clown white makeup is ""probably poisonous."") Otherwise, though, it's a fun book."
3,The Thirteenth Night,"I thought this book was OK. This is the author's first book, and that is the way it read. I think he did a good job on his first book but I am expecting better on his next."
4,"Interesting, especially for Anthony Perkins fans","Anthony Perkins' performance here reminded me of his portrayal of the husband in ""Five Miles to Midnight"" with Sophia Loren. Tony isn't the star, that would be the low-key Michael Sarrazin, more famous as Jacqueline Bisset's boyfriend than any of his acting roles and Susan Clark of ""Webster"" fame. However, this is a pretty good mystery. The script could have gone a bit farther and made it a film noir, but I didn't guess the ending until it was almost over. If you are a fan of Anthony Perkins, which I assume is the main reason you are looking at this review, then ""Deadly Companion"" will not disappoint. He has a couple of key scenes that you will definitely enjoy."
1,This book sucks!!!,"After two other dismal books, the Lyons brothers have sunk to a new low. This book is nothing more than garbage. It's filled with mistakes from cover to cover. There's only 200 pages and they're very small pages too. It's definitely not worth the price. I'd suggest staying away from any book Douglas and Jeffrey Lyons have anything to do with."
5,Perfect Birthday Gift,"This book was purchased for my daughter's 40th birthday. It was one of her favorites when she was growing up.I am having alllllll her long-time friends sign the book and I will present it to her on her birthday. By the way, her name is Jenny."
1,Save your money.,"I bought this clock for my daughter's bedroom since the theme is yellow. I should have kept my money because the clock doesn't work. It doesn't keep the correct time, even after replacing the battery several times. Don't waste your money."
5,Buy This ECHO If You Own No Other,"The ONLY collection of ECHO to buy if your budget is limited. Includes seminal tracks and flourishes with the final ""Bring on the Dancing Horses."" This album is a great collection of ""progressive hits"" that help to define a swath of (thankfully!) underplayed bands of the 1980s, long before ""progressive hit"" referred to grunge from seattle."
4,"""Greatest Hits"" package from a concept album band.","Although this is a decent sampler for the unanointed, the sheer intensity of the Bunnymen can only be felt through their proper albums. Suggested start? Porcupine. Then, Crocodiles before updating to Ocean Rain. Still, Bring On The Dancing Horses is their shining moment."
3,Sounds like most of the other stuff of its time...,"...until you get to track 8, ""The Killing Moon."" This CD is worth it if only for this song. Sure, you could buy ""Ocean Rain,"" but why not live a little and try out some of their earliest stuff with this album? It's not the rest of the songs are all that bad; they're just really, really dated. Good CD, and worth its price."
4,wonderful collection of old photograghs and postcards,"I had a hard time putting this book down. The pictures and photographs are arranged in chronological order so to me it read like a story. The tragic tale of Baby Doe was one of many great human interest elements. There were a couple typos, but I guess that's to be expected. I just got another book by this author with a similar format, Historic Telluride. It looks equally delightful."
3,Leadville Cemetary,"While this book did have many wonderful photos and stories, I was dissapointed in the total lack of photos of that incredibly interesting cemetary in Leadville which has graves of people who died 150 years ago. I find that cemetary to be just as interesting as the abandoned mines in Leadville."
5,"Great, underappreciated album",This is one of those albums that SHOULD have been the artist's breakthrough. Johnson doesn't have the greatest voice (reminds me of Richard Marx) but he is a huge guitar talent.
3,Good Album from a Great Guitar Player,"I saw Eric Johnson open for Stevie Ray Vaughan in 1985 and I thought, ""wow that guy can play"". Then in 1986 I saw this release sitting on the shelf at the local record store - so I bought it. At the time I loved it. Unfortunately, it does not hold up well. For the most part the instrumentals are pretty strong and I still enjoy them - particularly Victory. The vocal tracks are pretty dated sounding and were always a little hokey. Trail of Tears and Bristol Shore are easily the best of the vocal tracks. The entire recording has a very under-produced sound that I love to hear on a punk record but here it just sounds cheap and amateurish - there is a definite demo quality to the recording. With all that said I still play Tones once in a while and still enjoy listening to what was a decent prelude to a truly great album, Ah Via Musicom."
3,Good,Eric Johnson is plentiful in talent. I like his delivery in most of his work.But sadly when it came to grabing that brass ring for super stardom. It unfortunatly eluded him.
1,Soft Drizzle: An American Bland,"He's a fine guitar technician but . . . Is it the production? Is it the spirit of the musician? Is it the voice? This is probably the weakest example of 'guitar hero', MOR pop through which I've ever suffered. The intensity pours out of this album like a soft drizzle. And, please, STOP 'SINGING'! The vocal phrasings are plain dull, if not silly. The lyrics make me giggle!Unless you just want to learn some guitar licks, spend your money on an artist rather than this guitar 'hero'."
3,NOT SURE WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT???,"I bought this CD after reading some glowing reviews. Not sure why they were glowing. The instrumentals are OK, but not much more than that. Others ( HOEY / KEAGGY / JOHNNY A / ANDY TIMMONS / GALYSH etc.) do this sort of thing soooo much better and don't insult us with extremely stupid lyrics. His voice would also be better in the bathroom. That leaves the guitar playing. Yes he is fast and plays some unorthodox scales, has a good ear for melody and a pretty good tone. But so have many others and most of those produce far more cohesive and challenging CD's. I also saw ERIC live and that didn't help his cause. He was more bored than the audience and that was saying something. Not much response and a slowly emptying venue told the story. The fact that he followed the HELLECASTERS was also not in his favour. On the evidence of that evening he should not be allowed to string HELLECASTER guitars."
1,demo?,"bought it because, at it's release, ""Zap"" was being hyped...but having already been exposed to Dimeola, Gambale, Henderson, Holdsworth, Morse, etc., I thought ""Zap"" sounded like ""Crap"".saw EJ on Austin City Limits and that live version of ""Friends"" was interesting...much less so on this album. It's actually a decent song in comparison to most of the songs Eric has penned in his career. So, the album does have some intersesting moments, but for every one of them, there's three underdeveloped moments.If you must have EJ in your music collection: Ah Via Musicom"
3,A really nice album.,"Eric Johnson is a very proficient and impressive guitarist. I've always enjoyed listening to Tones and respect his guitar playing prowess. I also like his singing. Tones consists of nine tracks--four of the tracks are instrumentals. The album's musicianship is tight and skilled. The production and songwriting are also good and solid. My favorite songs are ""Friends"" and ""Emerald Eyes."" Both of these tunes are melodious and feature nice vocals from Eric Johnson. The chorus of ""Emerald Eyes"" is infectious. I'm glad I have Tones in my collection. It's a good piece of music. Worth a listen."
4,Eric Is One of my Favorites. No Cliche!!!!,My Main Man From my Home town. To me Eric Johnson I the most classiest guitar player I`ve heard. He seems to have a conservative flair. He is a melodic perfectionist. If you like virtuosos and if you play guitar you will appreciate Eric Johnson. He is a master especially at integrating rythm and lead into one technique. An excrutiatingly mature style. Very knowledgeable. Love him.
3,Censored =\,"This is a very good album indeed. Altho i was quite disappointed when i played the album after buying it and realized it was censored. Other than that small disappointment, very good album."
2,Dr. Dre did not produce this album and it shows!,"Perhaps I am spoiled by The Chronic and Doggystyle but this album just really doesn't sound that good. Dr. Dre did not produce this album and it definitely does not have his G-Funk signature sound. Snoop is obviously a huge talent but without that G-Funk sound to play off of it just doesn't work for me. Snoop can't cary the album on his vocal talents alone. I was very disapointed with this album, in fact I could hardly listen to it and it hasn't grown on me. The tracks and producing are just weak. The bass doesn't sound funky and there is not nearly the depth and complexity to the tracks on on Snoops previous works. As much as I want to like it, it is a very average album."
3,Smaller than it looks.,"I bought this bag to carry books; I'm a college student. It can carry two big textbooks and one pretty small textbook. Even then, it's a tight fit. It's also a lot smaller than it seems to be in the picture. No pencil holders. The zipper is weird looking. It collects hair and dust easily.If you need to carry books, get a Jansport, or other big backpack. If you're carrying miscellaneous items around, this might be good for you. Don't forget, Jansport can handle a lot of textbooks."
4,Not as described. Gold buckles.,"I ordered a Danish Style School Bag by Riot Threads - 15"" x 6.5"" x 11"". Instead I received a nearly identical bag by Rothco - 15"" x 11"" x 8, according to the new packaging. So this is a bag made by a different company, and 1.5"" wider.The buckles are a gold color.I haven't used it much or given it a wash at this point, so I can't vouch for its durability."
5,The BEST Harmonica book!,"Anyone wanting to learn blues harmonica, this is the book to buy.. The instructions are clear and easy to understand.. A lot to do with understanding music theory.. NOT boring, will keep you interested.."
1,Oil filter. Not like original tranny filter.,"This filter has different internal workings from the stock Subaru filter. It lacks the internal screen and has more filter medium than the stock filter, resulting in reduced flow. The original filter is intended for the lifetime of the car, but if you must replace it, use an OEM Subaru filter. The car will shift better."
2,Bland,"Cullen James has a good life: wonderful husband, healthy baby, good friends. Then one day the Rondua dreams start. Bones of the Moon took a long time to get started, and even then didn't feel like it was moving. A few major characters seemed to serve no purpose, and though all of them were likable, liking them wasn't enough to justify the amount of time spent developing them. The characters that did matter were involved in a lackluster quest in a dreamworld devoid of interest. The writing was neither wonderful, nor horrid, but could have used more editing; it was not uncommon to read dialog several times over to verify who had said what. Unfortunately, Bones of the Moon was just boring."
3,Surreal and captivating,"Carroll has written a lyrical, disturbing, and often beautiful fantasy. Because Rondua is a dream world specific to the main character, it is initially hard to feel truly interested in what happens there; the weirdness is a bit overwhelming. Eventually, though, Rondua comes to feel every bit as real and engaging as the ""real world."" Cullen herself is a bit like Rondua--not an entirely sympathetic character at first, she grows on you, especially after Mae enters the picture.Carroll's style is poetic and dreamy. You'll lose track of time occasionally, especially in the more deeply absorbing of the Rondua interludes, but there are other points where the plot drags. Carroll creates evocative (but not flowery) language, a dreamy atmosphere, an indefinable sense of menace, and some really interesting questions about where dreams and reality meet.I'm not running out to buy any more of Carroll's books, but fantasy fans could certainly do worse."
3,A Good Yarn,"A cautionary note here to anyone intending to read this book-one of it's main themes is abortion. The author does a good job of keeping his own opinion to himself and let's his characters express their views independantly, both pro and con. But I can understand if some people would find this unsettling. That being said I really did enjoy this book primarily for it's Rondua scenes as stated by many a previous reviewer. Add a half star to my rating and that would be more accurate. A lot of the plot outside of that world is a bit transparent but still engrossing. It did bring me close to tears in the final scenes and was compelling enough to elicit a second Carroll purchase. I hope this was helpful."
3,Bedtime story.,"I don't place this at the top of Carroll's efforts. There were a few places where it seemed he was maybe going to go back and fill in, but didn't get around to it. A couple of the characters virtually disappear in the last third of the book. The ending seemed rushed and incomplete.The series of dreams by Cullen are based on her guilt about a decision she had made a few years earlier. The surreal happenings in the dreams are interestingly handled but they didn't really draw me in.Even though I only found this to be OK, I do look forward to reading more of Carroll's books."
4,Fairy Tale for Adults,"Having read and enjoyed both The Wooden Sea and The Land Of Laughs, I was pleased to find Bones of the Moon sitting on the shelf at my local bookstore. I was between books so I bought it, got it home and started on it right away.Bones of the Moon is familiar territory for any readers who have read other Carroll novels. Carroll deftly blends real life with fantasy to form his unique hybrid. Unlike other books I've read by him, however, Bones of the Moon dragged a little bit. And I'm not sure why. By the time I reached the end, I was emotionally involved and was very pleased overall.This or any other novel by Carroll is worth a read. His imagination is unparalleled and its plain to readers that he enjoys what he does. I think Carroll's books are, to adults, what the Narnia or Oz series were to us when we were kids."
2,Diappointed,Accent of individual narrating and that of individual performing grooming techniques was too strong and not easily understood.Also video decription gave impression that more cutting or clipping was provided. This video offers basic instruction on bathing and nail cutiing..plus helpful hints on grooming..but litle on clipping..
1,disappointed,"the video was poorly done, all it shows is how to bathe a dog, nothing about the actual grooming. very poorly diplayed"
2,Video Review,I was disappointed in that I thought dog grooming included trimming the dogs hair and this video did not show that at all. It was the very basics of grooming which was not what I needed.
4,A meeting of cultures,"Because I, like the protagonist of this novel, am involved in an interracial relationship, I found quite a few similarities between my experiences and hers. The novel creates contradictory emotions within the reader, making you yearn to be there with Abby yet at the same time causing you to recoil from the treatment she gets from the men in her life. I can't wait to read Sandra Scofield's other works!"
4,Extremely sharp knife,"I got this knife for my sister who climbs and rafts. The hole is large enough that this will fit on a 'biner, which was something I was not sure about before purchasing. The only downside is that it should lock closed stronger."
4,Nice knife,"I wish now I had gotten the full sized one. There is nothing wrong with this one, I still plan on carrying it, but like a bigger type for possible rescues at work."
2,too quirky,"I am a fan of his, but this was way too quirky for me. Lost me very quickly.As much as I like the Dalhousie and #1 Detective Agency series, I disliked this one. Even his other short series are better.Don't judge this author by this book. Others are engaging and fun."
2,Disappointing,had previously read and loved the Ramotswe lady detective series. So I got this one by the same author. Boring...
3,von Ingelfeld goes South- and so does the book,"I'm afraid I found this book, the last of the trilogy of Alexander McCall Smith's von Ingelfeld stories about a stuffy German professsor, a letdown. I only found it moderately amusing. I quite enjoyed Portugese Irregular Verbs and nearly bust a gut laughing at The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs. I was anticipating an equally wonderful time with At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances. Although It had its moments, I did not find them frequently enough. I don't think I would bother."
2,Dr von Igelfeld afield,"Professor Dr Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld leaves the comfortable confines of the Philology department to take up a Sabbatical in Cambridge and then to travel to Columbia to accept an honor. This short volume (like the rest of this series this one is also only 120 pages or so long), only contains two stories. It is not necessary to read the earlier novels to appreciate this one, nor even to read these two stories in order.Fans of McCall Smith's other series, such as 44 SCOTLAND STREET, or CORDUROY MANSIONS, will possibly be disappointed in this one. Dr von Igelfeld is not as nearly sympathetic a character as others of McCall Smith's, nor is there an ongoing story being told. Dr von Igelfeld's exploits lean more towards the absurd than the other series. Unlike the other series I am not particularly anxious to read the next book in this series."
4,Delightful eccentricity,"Professor Von Igelfeld is quickly becoming one of my favorite fictional characters. I love novels about eccentric characters, and it's hard to imagine a character that fits the description better than Von Igelfeld. The wit is dry and at the same time laugh-out-loud funny. I am hoping for many, many more novels in this series from Mr. McCall Smith."
4,Feeling Depressed?,"If you need a lift, this book, along with the others in this series will do it. The improbable adventures of Professor Dr. von Igelfeld are wonderfully funny, the books are short, and, yes we can love a pompous stuffed shirt."
3,Von Igelfeld and the Villa of Reduced Circumstances,"I LOVE McCall Smith's books. Read the entire Ladies' Detective Agency series. This third part of Dr. Dr. Moritz Maria von Igelfeld is the least engaging of the three. Having lived in Germany, I was interested in Von Igelfeld's cultural approach to life. His thinking is funny, and I DO like McCall-Smith's humor and insight. However, as he travels around, at one point becoming the President of Columbia, doesn't bring forth McCall-Smith's sense of humor as much. The first two had me hating to put it down, this one I had to get myself to finish it. It does better as an audio book."
1,At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances,Not my type of story even though it was well-written. I like his humorous stories instead.
1,AN EARLY BOOK RESURRECTED FROM THE TRUNK??,A far cry from the Botswana and Edinburgh novels. Truly a disappointment. Not funny; not thought provoking; not even an accurate satire of academia. The Colombia segment was especially hokey and derivative. What was Alex thinking??
2,Not the best of this series,"I found this to be the weakest of the three books in this series. Without giving away the plot, I will say that the professor gets into a situation that, while humorous, is just too improbable to sustain itself well. Other reviewers have compared this series to the works of P.G. Wodehouse. There is something of that same dreamy quality to the stories, with characters whose feelings of social propriety and personal embarrassment make it difficult for them to avoid or escape awkward situations. Smith does a good job of creating characters who are sympathetic despite their flaws. But there is a feeling of something missing. Here, he never reaches the depth that he achieved in his ""Ladies Detective Agency"" series, and he doesn't provide enough humor to compensate for that."
3,It started off good....,"This games started off with great promise.... until I got through about 10 races and realize that most of the courses were simply made longer for the harder races. It got repetitive really quick to run the same races over and over. The cars you unlock don't look all that much different from each other either, which just makes me not care about playing it anymore. The music was good though, great to race to. If you are looking for a really good racing game, go for need for speed. If you are a Ridge Racer fan, go for this."
3,A little warning,"I rate how much I like video games by how much I enjoy it and by how long it takes to win. Ridge Racer is addicting, and I spent plenty of time on it, but found that I'd unlocked all the tours in less than five days. It's hard to win all the tours, though, so that might keep me occupied for a while. Still, many would find it discouraging to go around the same track over and over and over. If you can rent it or borrow it from a friend, do so. If you can only buy it, go for it, but be ready to want to trade it in after a few weeks."
4,"when in doubt, just keep drifting","the problem of this game is this.. simply by deliberately drifting the car, you can avoid hitting the boundary, hence the reduction of speed.. although drifting too recklessly could slow you down.. but a well managed but a bit aimless drifting can help avoiding penalty.. and put your car back onto the right direction and track... which i think is a flaw... this makes the game a bit easlier to finish.. and a bit routine"
1,A Mind for Murder,"Anyone considering the purchase of this book should know the original publisher pulled the book soon after it began due to a lawsuit. Check out the website which is the same title as the book, but is typed with no spaces between each word."
2,Phooey,A host of shallow and despicable characters in France. WHo cares? Why would a famous pop diva be going out with such a weirdo and who could possibly buy the drivel about the East Somarians. The non-party at the Negresco at the end was worth the wait. There were some sexy scenes which the book could have used more of. I would recommend Passport Diaries instead!
4,Very funny!,"A group of working class American women suddenly come into an incredibly huge sum of money. They all end up going to a lifestyle makeover specialistic so they can all high-tail it out of town before poor-trash relatives can catch up with them to ask for money! In the meantime, some east Somarian brothers are waiting on the French Riviera, ready to kidnap them...only these guys aren't East Somarians at all! In the meantime, in a parallel universe, a famous, African American pop star who lives on the Riviera finds out that her European lover is not who he appears to be, and they begin attempts to try and renegotiate their relationship.Ladyfingers is the most clever and outrageous story of ""American foreign relations"" I have ever read. The biggest problem I had with the story is that it left you wondering what happened to the Filmmaker and his bride after the disastrously ridiculous Wedding Banquet."
3,Chock full of sterotypes...or is it?,"When I first finished reading this book, I thought to myself that it was fulled with every stereotype in the world. Then, I read some of it again and decided that is simply was the author's point of view. Actually, it is kind of cool that the author used the various stereotypes in order to show people how to NOT fall into sterotypical actions and behavior.Except for the East Somarian kidnappers, I found most of the characters realistic and completely politically INCORRECT!"
3,"More of the same thing, except in Europe!","Hated the book, loved the party. But then, that's how I felt about Welch-Tyson's novel, Gingersnaps. I wonder what the next party will be?"
3,Los Arcangeles,Es un libro que ayuda grandemente en el crecimiento personal y en el fortalecimiento espiritual.
2,Poor content,My kids love Helllo Kitty. I bought this video thinking the kids would LOVE it! And I was right! They absolutely loved it. The theme song is catchy to say the least and the clay characters are very captivating to the kids. The only problem I have was the content. They are showing the characters being mean to each other and crying and being grumpy but then never coming to a resolution. The stories end with me wondering what happened next?! The behavior modeled would have been fine if there was a proper response to the bad behavior modeled as well. All in all..fun to watch but low quality content/storyline.
2,Not one of his best,"I am a big Richard Laymon fan. His writing was phenominal! I believe that there were certain manuscripts he decided not to publish because they were not up to par. Unfortunately this was one of those novels. Long and drawn out with humdrum dialog among characters that are just plain out boring. If your just getting to know some of his work, I recommend not to plunge into this until you've read all of his books that was published while he was alive."
3,DARKNESS TOLD US!,"This is an interesting laymon book about a bunch of friends messing around with an ouija board that tells them to go into the mountains where they will find what they think is some kind of ""reward"" and they couldn't be more wrong.........What's also interesting about this book is that the twist towards the end is pretty darn good but i somehow figured it out without even meaning too, it just popped into my head while reading the book.....Now beware, this book has alot of build up before it hits the ground running and before then there are flaws and questions a' plenty! the end is very gruesome and hardcore and the book is loved by many fans but for me it lacks and was too slow with not much put inbetween before the great stuff comes. It had the potential, just didn't capatilize."
4,"Laymon &#65533; Darkness, Tell Us","Laymon's novels are so much fun - this one is no exception. Darkness, Tell Us is similar in nature to my favorite Laymon effort, Island. Take a group of people stranded in a remote camp site in the mountains, add deranged killer and you end up with a perfect vehicle for Laymon's twisted imagination. Darkness, Tell Us is a quick, entertaining read sure to please Laymon fans old and new."
1,This has to be the most overrated guy in horror,Don't let the good setup or back cover fool ya. This book makes 0 sense and has all the total WTFFF moments you can imagine and a tacked on ending. How does this moron get published? I want my money back!!!
3,Authorship Not Questioned,"Contrary to the somewhat ill-informed review by Publisher's Weekly, there is no question as to whether or not Richard Laymon wrote _Darkness, Tell Us_. It is also not a previously ""unseen"" novel left gathering dust after his untimely death. _Darkness, Tell Us_, like many other Laymon titles, saw publication in Britain while Laymon was very much still alive. _Darkness..._ was first published in 1991 by Headline Book Publishing. The novel, pretty typical of Laymon's work with all of his various strengths and weaknesses, is just now being published in the US. Laymon fans in the US, hopefully, can look forward to a number of other previously published in Britain Laymon titles finally being released in the States."
3,It was just okay,"For the most part, I enjoyed this novel. It wasn't a thrill a second or a ""can't-sleep-tonight"" novel, but it was good.Storyline:When six college students play with a ouija board at their professor's house, the spirit of the board, Butler, promises to lead them to a treasure if they will go to a place called Calamity Peak in the mountains. They steal the board and head out. When the professor discovers the kids stole her board, she and her lover set out after them. She's seen firsthand how dangerous the board can be and fears Butler is leading them to their deaths.Pros:It's a quick and engaging read. The sex scenes are often steamy and detailed. (Though that can be a drawback for those not interested in borderline erotica). There are plenty of plot twists and suspense.Cons:Some of the dialogue is flat and dated."
3,Dern shrinking Violets,"This is my third Laymon novel. I liked Vampire Circus, but Flesh put me off sex for several months. OK, let's try Darkness, Tell Us.I was puzzled by Howard's internal dialog. I suppose that 20 yr old men think about sex often, about once a minute per survey. What I found strange was his page-consuming dither and speculation about imagined consequences of any action, and how his thoughts would be perceived by his peers and his teacher, if only they knew. At last I solved the mystery...Howard is a Barbara Cartland heroine in male disguise. All the tremulous insecurity! All the sincerity and good intentions! All the naivety and trying to be a ""good"" person.The problem is that the 30 yr old instructor and her brother-in-law have similar internal doubts. I never thought I would object to trembling sensitivity in a Laymon story, but...Still hoping to find an adult character in this book."
2,Disappointing for Laymon,"I've been a big fan of Richard Laymon's other works, but this one does not measure up. The story of a group of kids taking off on a wild camping trip in search of a treasure they learned about by using a Ouija board sounds like a good premise, but for me it was too all over the place. What the guy out in the wild who attacked the group had to do with the underlying story of Angela's family abuse made no sense. I still wonder who he was or what he eventually wanted to do with Coreen since he kept saying he wouldn't hurt her. I didn't feel any emotional connection or empathy towards the characters and I found the ending to be rather stupid. Despite my dislike for this particular book, I'm still a Laymon fan and will continue to read his other books."
1,Astoundingly bad in every way,"This animated movie is beyond words. The story itself is too sophisticated for children, but the animation is also terrible, practically unwatchable! It always breaks my heart to see a project that people obviously worked very hard on turn out to be so bad. But, it has to be truly awful for my five year old to ask to turn it off. He'll watch absolutely anything kid-related (Teletubbies? Scooby Doo dubbed in Spanish? you get the picture. if I didn't limit his television, he'd be Mike TV), but this was so awful he couldn't get through it. I didn't spend much money on this, but I'm sorry I spent anything!"
1,So mad that I wasted money on this movie!,I purchased this movie for my 3 year old twins. I put it on and was coming in out while doing laundry. I listened to what they were saying and I was SHOCKED. I casually pulled the plug behind the tv and told my children that the dvd broke and acted dumbfounded. If I had just turned it off they would have been upset. Moral of the story is don't waste your money. This movie goes down in history as one of the worst childrens movies ever made.
2,Misses the mark. Few good points.,"I must echo similar feelings as the other reviewers. Inappropriate for children, too many adult references. Fortunately, I checked it out from the library for free and wasted no money on it. I can say it has a couple of cute points: the love story between the two bunnies is cute and it is set in a nice European style town. Other than that, it is not so good animation, inappropriate content for children. Then there are the inaccuracies: the egg factory makes 7 million eggs in one day and later the takeits steal all the eggs and they all fit in one truck, also, why would chickens steal eggs to eat, and then there is the one evil chicken that has teeth. Really, I know kids stories can take liberties when telling a story, but inaccuracies like these, we don't need to put in our heads. Disney often misses the mark too, but at least they are tasteful. I would pass on this one or watch it without your kids if you are bored."
2,Dissapointing Rabbit,"There's nothing printed about the origins of these live tracks, but most of the takes are from Bless It's Pointed Little Head and Monterey 67. There are also 4 songs that are creditied to J.A. , but are actually another band altogether (and not a very good one). Only about 2 actual J.A. tracks here that I was not able to identify the source of, and they may be available elsewhere too (if the other tracks are any indication).Probably best to avoid this, unless you don't have BIPLH or Monterey, then the current $3 amazon used price might justify the purchase."
2,.boring,"their was no blood, on his head and the word on pic was distracting they should put that on the bottom"
4,An addictive novel which commands you to be frightened.,"Cormier's tasty, realistic and insightful language makes you believe this impossibility of an action. (fading). Or is it impossible? This book primarily addresses the queston ""What if?"" and leaves you to compose your own protection in a world of uncertainties. A wonderful read."
4,Good but disgusting,"Fade is a great book about a man that wrote a manuscript about his power to fade into the invisible. This power, supposedly handed down from uncle to nephew, was evil and took control of peoples bodies. Cormire went a little overboard with disgusting things when Paul was spying although, so I do not recommend this book to people who are easily offended."
4,This novel has not faded away. Still a good read,"In 1938 13 year old Paul discovers he can ""fade"" - or turn invisible. At first it seems a fantastic gift, but it is one that he finds soon enough comes with both an emotional and physical price.This novel is very evocative of the time and places the stories within in it take place. It is in some ways like a linked chain of short stories moving from the 1930's to the 1980's.While aimed at teen readers, this novel would be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys a dash of the fantastic in their stories and well drawn characters. To top it off the fade itself is somewhat creepy and the author makes it clear what a two edged sword such an ability might be."
4,"Question the reality, face the consquences.",Fade is one of the most disturbing and riveting novels I have ever read. Paul and his family know the secret of some of the members that can become invisible but refuse to face it. By introducing the publisher and granddauther into the story the credibility of Paul's story comes into question. Cormier never shies away from violence and fear- these elements are present in each of his stories. Stephen King said it best when he described Fade as a cross between Holden Caulfield and the invisible man. Tis most makes the reader question what he would do if he had this power- would the invisibility unlease the darker side of our natures? Older teens and adults would find this a great book for discussion.
4,Fade,"If you like other books by Cormier, you're sure to like this one too. It is has several different settings and characters, and they take a lot of unexpected turns. Once I started reading, I had trouble putting the book down. Paul is 13 years old when he learns he has inherited the ability to become invisable. But, he soon finds out that it is not as great as it sounds, and that the Fade seems to have a mind of its own. We follow him throughout his first summer with the fade, until the terrible thing happens. Paul vows to never enter the fade again. As an adult, he must track down his nephew, Ozzie, who has just realized his ability to fade. It is up to Paul to stear him away from the evil that comes with the fade. But, will he succeed?P.S. I would recommend this book for older teenagers. However, it does have some mild sexual content and violence."
1,NOT suitable for children!!!!!! Contains spoilers .....,"My review contains spoilers so consider yourself warned. Parents, please read this book before you even think about letting your children read it!!!! Totally inappropriate content for impressionable young people..... unless you have no problems letting them read about a thirteen year old boy encouraged to lust after his own Aunt, same boy witnesses a man molesting a young girl and this event is described in great detail, same boy witnesses incest between a brother and sister, same boy commits murder....... do I need to go on ???Why is this book categorized the way it is? For adults, these topics are disturbing and difficult to deal with and to offer it as ""entertainment"" for children is just WRONG! It's very depressing and I know it would have the same effect on children."
2,sorry.but positivly inapropriete and perverse,"i know this is for young adults about thirteen or older but cormier should have considered the age group before writing such things. it was well written to be truthful but after Paul discovers his powers he uses them to dig into others lives.and not to mention his sexual obsession with his aunt! as well as mr. dondier and theresa!!! it was disgusting through and through..after reading the first part i stpped, turned to the back and saw a picture of old robert cormier. i dont know what his brillliat mind lets loose in his writing but the irrelevent sexual content was so wrong that the book was banned from fairfax county!! i searched it up on google and the book was removed from my local library!fade was fine in literature but i still would not recommend This novel to anyone. chocolate wars was good too but with some sexual referance.."
4,"A good book, but kind of perverted","I really, really liked the main topic in this book and it was so intriguing. Cormier is a really good author and I love so many of his books. This is one of the best by far. But one letdown that I didn't enjoy was how much perversion there was in it! It was so disturbing sometimes. I almost wanted to stop reading it after a certain point, but I didn't because the story was too good. So, too much nasty stuff, but a great story."
4,Fade in our hearts,"This book is great! It totally reveals the different aspects people view on certain subjects. We, in our daily lives, would sometimes wonder if we acquired such and such supernatural powers, and what we would do with such and such powers. The truth is, when we actually get these powers, the vicious minds of ours would emerge and the world would fall into chaos. The book Fade pointed this out clearly. Susan and her grandfather's views on the power of fading are also reflected in this world. To believe or not believe, I think every character each of us would interfere this issue. Just like Susan's grandfather, being a detective had surely shaped him into a more logical person. This book Fade stated many situations and thoughts encountered either spiritually physically in our lives and personally I think it¡s a must for every readers."
2,Not as good as the last Cormier book I read,"I've already read The Chocolate War, and it's sequel and I loved them both. So I automaticallly had high expectations for this book (which was assigned for school). It's starts out great but as I read more and more it started to get choppy and lose quality. Infact the whole Ozzie chapter seems to be rushed threw, like he was in a rush to finish the darn thing. My favroite charecters (Susan and Rosanne) don't even have big parts. But just in case your still intrested here's a summary of the book.Paul has the ability to fade away into nothing, become invisable. In every generation of the Moreaux family there is someone born with the fade and this time it's Paul. But the fun of the Fade is soon spoiled when Paul sees things he shouldn't see, and dose things he shouldn't do. How will the next generation deal with the fade?"
1,"If you have the book, toss it NOW!","This book is awful. Twice in it he describes sneaking into other peoples bedrooms to fulfill his own desires and finds something worse. If you are getting this book for someone younger than high school, think twice!!!"
1,Pornographic to say the least,"Keep in mind this is a Teen book. Let's read a couple of excerpts, shall we?""Mr. Dondier sat down on the piano bench, his face red and sweating and his eyes strange and staring, as he raised her legs onto his shoulders and plunged his face between her legs. He moaned and his shoulders jerked violently as he burrowed between her thighs."" (The ""her"" here is a girl his daughter's age!)""I was hot with desire for her body. I wanted to caress her, to gorge myself on her....I bent forward, trying to make myself small and, at the same time, to hold back that quick beautiful terrible spurt but unable to do so. As our eyes met, my body quivered with delight. I had never known such piercing happiness, such an explosive moment of sweetness."" (This is a boy obssesed with his aunt!)I wish I could give ZERO starts to this piece of trash, pushed by the American Library Association, available in the CHILDREN's area of most Public Libraries! Shame on librarians!"
3,Interesting bits of the Princess of Wales' pre-divorce life,"The video starts with some scenes from Diana's 1983 & 1996 trips to Austrailia then proceeds to go through a short ( the whole video is only 49 minutes) history of her life, taking a mostly pro-Diana viewpoint. You'll have seen some of the footage before, but not all of it, and of four people interviewed I think only one was new to me. As the box description says the program was produced before her death, I think I saw 1996 in the program but 1998 and 2001 on the cover so the material has been around awhile. Dodi Fayed is shown twice on the box but he's not even mentioned in the program."
5,Happy to find these somewhere!,"I didn't find these to be too sweet. They're Pop-Tarts, they have sugar, this is strawberry milkshake. And they are good! They're even better frozen. Local grocery stores seemed to have stopped carrying the larger assortment of Pop-Tarts so I'm glad I can still get these."
2,too sweet,Way too sweet. The only way I could eat these was to wash them down with milk or coffee. D. Crebs
4,I like it,"It's very good worth the price. Lasts a long time, strong. I would recommend it. I let dog out in yard & this gives him room to walk around a bit."
4,It Depends on What You Want...,"If you or your child is the type of toy enthusiast that is all about playing dress-up with your dolls, consider this:Christie's hair is factory set so the bandana fits on the top. If you want to put her in a different outfit where the bandana is tacky, you can it off, but her hair could look funky without it. The good thing is that it'll challenge you to find creative ways to do her hair without the bandana.Just something to think about. This doll is very beautiful and her hair is the essence of african beauty. I would definitely recommend this one."
5,This is a GREAT album,"Im am so glad that I bought this album. I love every song on it. I also went on your web site (www.stevenhallmusic.com) and it was hot. I'm so happy that the music industry is changing back to smooth and soulful R&B. Music that stands for somthing. My favorite sond is ""Can't let you get by me"". ANd the song I dedicated to my exboyfriend is ""Lust doesn't last"". I hope the steven hall continues to make more music. And i will continue to buy it. Great job on the album!!! keep it going!!!"
5,Sunflower Oil Organic,"This sunflower oil is very good. It has a very pleasing nut like flavor, and is very light as well as tasty. I will buy it again."
4,Go BU!,"Easy to install. Great product. Wish it was a little heavier/higher quality, but once it's on the car, it looks great!"
5,Yummy Delish!!,"I get this regularly, and go through it more then my other spices. It's great on fruit, popcorn, coffee, and just about anything you're creative enough to put it on. I tried this for the first time at the movies, but it's hard to find in stores locally. Since I've got it, the whole family is hooked. Popcorn just doesn't taste the same without it."
2,"Not Great, but OK","I have to agree with Matt, stuff doesn't stick very well - not uniformly anyway. And it does have a strange aftertaste.I tried it on my oatmeal, and it is good, but not great.I got the cheese flavor for my wife and she doesn't like it at all. And she LOVES cheese popcorn.So, our experience is not real positive. Difference in tastes I guess.Not a total loss, however, since I bought 2 boxes (1 caramel, 1 cheese) and there were 6 in each box.I couldn't return them, so I put the ones we hadn't opened in a Christmas basket I made up for work.They disappeared in a couple of days, so maybe some of my co-workers will like it and buy more."
2,They shipped the wrong product,I ordered 3 sets and one of them was the wrong flavor. It was very disappointing. The caramel is good but they sent some sort of BBQ flavor instead. I live in Canada and would have to drive all the way back to the US to return the product which is not worth the price of the product.
5,very sexy and hip,I bought this for my husband. He loves it and gets many compliments! It is very sexy and hip looking as well as very well made. It is just a beautiful bracelet.
3,A little more depth and insight would have been helpful,"This is a somewhat dry biography. The author's grammar is occasionally convoluted, and there was at least one spelling error per chapter, which speaks of poor editing. Yet I managed to enjoy the book because at least it answered some basic questions and somewhat satisfied my curiosity about Frances Cleveland, our (to date) youngest First Lady.A major disappointment is that there are NO photographs in the volume. The reader is told over & over how beautiful she was, arguably the most beautiful First Lady we've ever had, but NO photographs, with the exception of the cover!I would have enjoyed this more, had the writer's style been more crisp. It is a very slim volume and I could have wished for more insightful analysis of Frances' character and her choices throughout life. With hindsight (always 20-20!), I would look for a used or library copy of this book before I spent a great deal of money obtaining a copy to own."
1,Bad News - Doesn't stick well - too small - Just look at the photo they provide -,"if it doesn't stick to the batch floor it isn't good. It's too small to rub any area well. The whole thing has fake plastic bristles that don't really work. The center part here is made to be removable and you can buy an OPTIONAL soap dispenser? Really? REALLY? Try to get soap on your feet without the optional dispenser! Bad design. Good idea. Oddly I got the big single foot one for less also and that's fine. Sticks, bigger and better all around. Still need to get soap on your feet . . ."
5,Hard drive brackets,"These brackets are very well made with an old school look. A good choice if you lost the 5.25"" drive bay cover or need to install a hard drive in a 5.25"" bay with air flow."
5,"Schwinn.... Win, Win, Win!!","Awesome purchase!! Best looking bike on the block!!Excellent performance, especially the shock absorbing feature!!"
