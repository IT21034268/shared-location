4,Mr. Mull will LOVE this!!,"I just finished reading the book and all I can say is WOW. If you are having trouble finding a book to read look no further. Pet Sematary is an amazing book. Stephen King is a very talented writer. He uses imagery very well. During most scenes it feels like I'm standing there.This book is not for everyone though. If you are easily scared or upset then I wouldn't recommend it. Even though this isn't King's scariest book, it has it's moments. One of these is when Gage, the 3 year old that comes back from the dead, is upstairs hiding and Louis has to find him. It's scary because it is suspensefull.After reading this book I will never bury my dead animals/family in that Micmac burial ground up the street from me. But overall I would rate this book a 4 out of 5 stars, The only flaw I saw was that when King forshadows he gives away a little too much info. But the rest of the book was flawless."
3,Never judge a book by it's cover,"When I first started reading Pet Sementary I thought that it'd be fast pasted and would make me wet myself because of the cover. I was wrong, it was very slow at first. I kept waiting for something to happen. There was a few good moments in the book but I was ready to put that book down. But you shouldn't do that as I found out. It may have been slow in the beginning but boy did it get exciting at the end. It makes your whole body get all stingly and if someone touched you you'd probably scream. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to get a good scare!!!"
5,pet sematary will leave you begging for more horror,"A YOUNG FAMILY WITH A MEANINGFUL FUTURE MOVES TO MAINE TO SETTLE DOWN,BUT THEY REALLY SETTLE UPON ''UNDYING'' HORROR,THE SAME HORROR THAT CONTINUES TO HAUNT THEM NO MATTER HOW DEEP THEY TRY TO ''BURY'' IT'S SECRET"
5,pet senatary,paints great pictures with words. goes back and forth between the paranormal and just outright crazy. you either hate or love this book.
2,writing - excellent; plot - needs a little help . . .,"I've been a fan of Stephen King's ever since I read 'Carrie' five years ago, and I consider him one of my writing role models. When I picked up 'Pet Sematery', I expected something more. The book was well written in terms of characterization (although Creed needs a little help), but the plot left me wanting more. I felt that I had been a bit shortchanged, because I believed that King could do a lot better. Once I had finished, my mind kept going over the possibilities with the pet sematery and its certain 'magic'. It was a good idea for a plot, just not greatly executed. I'm sorry that I didn't enjoy it, because all of his other books thrilled me beyond imagination. The man is definitely a prime example of horror fiction."
5,Love it,"another great Stephen King book, just like a few other I wish this was on kindle edition also but for some reason is not yet."
5,Very Scary,"This was the first Stephen King novel I read, and I couldn't sleep the whole time I was reading it."
3,"Horrific and gorey, yet boring and lifeless","King gives his readers an all out gore, blood, and corpsefilled book with ""Pet Sematary"", yet he doesn't give themany reason to like the characters or feel anything about them. The ending turns out awful for every character, and leaves the reader feeling depressed. There are many moments of extreme horror, like only King can do, but all in all, readers should stick to his masterpieces like ""It"", ""The Stand"", and ""The Shining""."
5,MASTERFUL HORROR!!!!!!,"The master of horror, Stephen King, has blown me away with this disturbingand wonderful tale of modern horror. In the beginning, it starts out with anideal family but when the family cat dies, Louis Creed learns of a literal hell on earth.I recommend this to all people who love horror, it gave me the jumps for almost a week.If you read this book, I suggest you leave a light on when you go to bed.It may surpass the title but this bookreally does not have that much to do with pets. It is probably my favorite SK book.VICTOR AGE 11"
4,One of his finer books,"I'm in honors English and for one of our final projects we had to read a challenging book of our choice. I asked around to all of my friends what book I should read. A few of them recommended Pet Sematary, by Stephen King. Now I'm recommending it to you. Pet Sematary is such a suspensful book. It may seem like it's too long (376 pages), but once you pick it up I promise you won't want to put it down. Every event happens one after the other and you won't want to miss a thing. If you are into horror stories this is the definitely your book. It won't exactly leave you scared of the dark. But, it will definitely send chills down your spine. Stephen King is a very talented author, and Pet Sematary is one of his finer books."
5,Animal Ghosts and Human Experiments,"A charged high concept with added change, Pet Semetary is a must read from King, a true 20th century horror story delivering on the same moral dilemmas that are faced by characters written into 19th century horror literature, a classic tour-de-force notion, here King takes a doctor through journey of ancient animal burial grounds, resurrection of dead pets and what happens to the good doctor when the local highway wins a member of his family.That is the synopsis. No more needs to be said or done because King does it better within these pages."
1,A good book but very confusing,I read the book pet sematary by stephan king. I didnt get the concept of the book because it switched to differant places and it was hard to understand where it was at in the story. It would change without even saying it changed. This book is about a doctor who moves to a new town out in the country and he lives acrossed the street from a guy named Jud Crandal and his wife. They become friends and the doctor is at Jud's house every night having a beer. One day Jud takes the doctor on a hike to a place that will change his life forever. BAH ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ
2,Predictable,"If this is Stephen King at his best then I don't want to readany of his other books. This story was very predictable. It was socompletely obvious exactly what was going to happen in the end. The only reason I finished was to make sure that I was right, and I was."
5,Riviting New England Yarn,"Even if you have seen the movie, nothing can prepare you for the tale that King spins. You fallow Louis Creed in a hypnotic jorney finding things that no man dare explore. As is stated in the book. ""he soil of a Man's heart is stoner"""
4,Not a book for young kids.,Another far fetched story and I wouldn't bother seeing the movie because it really doesn't do this book justice. The book is very well written but I wouldn't want my children to read this mainly because of the little boy and his accident with the truck. It upset me so I don't think it's appropriate for kids.
4,20 year old paper back book,What can you say about this. It is a best seller and they made a movie based on it. Stephen King is a master story writer. His fiction is one of a kind. The public can't get enough of it.
5,Review on Stephen King's Pet Sematary,"i read the book pet sematary for my class here in school and i thought it was an excellent book. the descriptiveness that king uses throughout the book left me with vivid pictures of every gruesome detail, and the skill with which he writes left me hanging on every word he said, waiting to see what would happen next. Some would say that what Louis (hes the main character) did what was entirely predictable, and they would be right. however, i hold that it is not what he did but how he did it. predictable, but entirely enjoyable none the less. i reccomend this book to all who enjoy reading King's works, and even if you don't i still recomend it to you. after all, it beats the heck out of some mushy romance novel(blecch)...."
5,a Wonderful suspensfull scary novel,All I can say is WOW!!!!!!!!!!! I am not one to easily be scared by Horror novels but this one was enough to make me check the closet before going to bed!!!!!!!
5,personal grave yard,"Follow a father's struggle with his son's death as he borders on the verge of insanity. At the discression of his neighbor one man is preplexed to bury his son in the old Indian Semetary. Superstition has it that once burried in the Indian grave yard, the body will soon return to life. Already experimenting with the graveyard, the father finds out that just because things come back they will never be what they once were. Listless, lifeless, and full of demons. Definitely a classic in the King hall of fame."
2,Have internet access? Then why buy?,"While this dictionary is not bad, I've found that I encounter many terms in law school that are not in there. Then I'll do an internet search and find that missing term, usually with ease. Now I usually check the internet first. Really the only reason to buy a legal dictionary, like any dictionary, is if you think you will need it because you would have no computer or internet access. Otherwise, save your money."
2,Black's Law Dictionary Digital Bundle,"The only disapointing problem about this ""digital"" Bundle is that there is NO software. Instead you download a kind of ""browser"" that is in your toolbar, Much like a Google/Yahoo toolbar. So if you are off line, this does not work, disappointing to me. It is not as readily accessible as a software install that is always there when you need it. I have gained more use from the book than the software, so I would recommend you buy something else for your $$ such as the full version of Black's Law than this software. You can copy/cut and paste the info from the website directly into your paperwork is a good benefit though."
4,Smaller but still takes up space...,"Although much smaller than the full text version, this one still gets annoying in the backpack all day. However, I must say I use it often and more frequently than I use online dictionaries..."
4,LEGAL DEFINITIONS,FOR THE YEAR THIS BOOK WAS PRINTED THE LEXICOGRAPHICAL ENTRIES WERE VERY ACCURATE. ADDING THE U.S. CONSTITUTION TO THE APPENDIX WAS A NICE BONUS.
4,Necessary for law school,"I was worried that the pocket edition would not have enough information in it, but I haven't looked up a word that was not in it yet. I've been in law school for five weeks now and I feel like I've spent about as much time reading Black's as actually reading case books. But you should note that the book is not actually pocket size, it is more like a paperback novel size."
4,Blacks is the best,"Blacks is the best on the market in terms of law dictionaries. However, the downside is you need an internet connection for it and that is not always the most convenient for those with limited internet access. So much nicer when you can just save things to your computer if you choose."
5,Good stuff.,"It isn't the full book, but it covers everything you will need for the first and second semester of law school."
4,paralegal student,"I think I should have just bought the full-sized dictionary for my desk at home, as not all words/phrases are included in this one...a little extra money seems worth it, although, then I could not carry this around in my backpack."
4,Good Buy!,I really like this book. It is compact which means I can carry it with me wherever I go. It will certainly help me in my paralegal studies.
3,Black's Law Dictionary,"This book was actually a gift for my son's use. After he received it , he realizeds it was not what he actually needed. Thankyou."
5,Herbal Actives Coleus Forskohilli Forslean,"I have taken this product for a year. It is the one with the amount of forskohilli that works to bust the fat cells.I lost quite a bit of weight using this with Konjac Root, Astragalus Root and Ultimate African Mango Extract.I ate what I wanted, I'm a vegetarian and working towards being a vegan. My cholestrals also decreased usingthese products. I don't know if the Coleus Forskohilli was the reason but because of what it does I thought maybe it was the reason. I'm taking a break for a while and then it's time to have my cholestrals tested again.I will report back if my levels go up."
2,WELL!!,Tried it did not get the results advertised. Guess it was wish full thinking from Dr. OZ!! would not but again!
4,excellent product,I heard rave reviews for this product . and i have lost ten pounds so far. Been using for 60 day so far
1,Wouldn't charge--useless and frustrating,"This item looked like an ideal solution for friends in Uganda where there is very erratic electricity but lots of sunshine. I tried to get it to work before taking it with us on our trip but could never get it to charge. I called the customer service and was told to try several things to ""reset"" it. Nothing worked. I sent it back and got a refund but wasted a lot of time."
3,A few facts,"Just a few facts about this product to let you know what you are buying:Recorded at the Residencia de Estudiantes, Madrid-June 2001Directed by Manuel PalaciosOriginal title: Chavela Vargas Concierto PrivadoMusicians: Toya Arechavala, Luis Guarneros - guitarsJuan Miguel Fernandez Sastron - percusionSongs: Macorina - Un mundo raro - Soleded - Si no te vas - Luz de luna -Las simples cosas - Las ciudades - Maria Tepozteca - Vamonos - Piesa en mi - Se me hizo facil - En el ultimo trago -La LLoronaTotal playing time approx. 55 min.I love Chavela Vargas and I rather have this DVD than nothing at all, then it seems to be the only DVD available from her.The camara here is rigid, the audience too upright and the stage very simple-minded. Chavela is great and if you like her, you are giong to like this DVD.But if ever comes out her recording from AT CARNEGIE HALL on DVD, I hope it comes out soon, I think thats the one to have."
3,Exactly what you'd expect,"If you are a stern fan and a fan of Artie's other work (Dirty Work, It's the whiskey talking), then chances are you will enjoy this movie. It's what you might expect for a low budget movie. Out of 8 my friends that have viewed this movie, I'd say 6 of us enjoyed it. Not oscar worthy but good."
2,"As bad as expected, but unfortunately not ""Hah Hah"" bad","I listen to Howard daily, and yet I still had low expectations for this movie since it never saw a wide release. However I was disappointed when I watched the movie and found that it's not even comically bad, but rather it's pretty boring.The plot is about as good as a porno's, the comedy is about as funny as a porno's, and the nudity is about as good as... well, not a porno -- even that couldn't save it.I was hoping for a funny B movie but Beer League failed to deliver."
4,Big Stern Fan,"I am a sirius subscriber. I had a bad feeling about this movie, but wanted to watch as a fan of the Stern show. Artie's talents are much better used on the radio, than this movie. It's one liner, after one liner. The production value is quite low. Ralph Machio may as well be part of the set design, because his part is so miniscule. The story is non-existent. And the comedy is at the 4th grade level. But there are a few big laughs. Anyways, for fans of the radio show, this is probably a must see, and I'm happy with my purchase. But for non-listeners my rating drops to a 2 out of 5."
3,could be better,"You see, I am a huge fan of Artie Lang! HUGE! but.... this movie falls short it is not, as funny as I hoped! it uses the F word in the whole movie it's not that funny!"
3,Some incredible character actors in this movie,"As a fan of Artie's I could not wait to see this film. It's worth watching for the performances of the supporting cast; they are wonderful. There are some fun moments, charming bits and hilarious/raunchy one-liners. My criticisms are these: some of the scenes and dialogue did not seem fluid or natural, and the editing seemed odd in spots and unfortunately Artie is not the best actor. I love his stand-up but his acting chops need some serious polishing. Again see it if you are a fan of Artie's and for a bunch of fabulous segments with awesome character actors. Don't expect too much, let go and you can enjoy this movie."
4,Funny but dirty!,Artie Lange he's as raw as they come. To see this guy in high def is a trip. I would only recommend this movie to adults. For the high def buffs the AQ is ok the PQ is good for this type of movie. For 10-15 bucks it's a must have.
2,Stick to the Stern Show,"Love The Howard Stern Show, love Artie on the show, but man was this movie a turd. It just wasnt funny. The script is horrible, the acting is horrible (especially Artie), its poorly shot, etc. Avoid at all costs."
2,"Artie needs to gamble away your money, buy his DVD","The Stern show is one heck of a promotion machine. When howard had a book, a movie and his move to Sirius; they advertised it for two hours a day.Any poor guy that works in the real world would have lost his job if found to be on Drugs. Artie should buy a batch of heroin from the sales of this DVD.F'Jackie"
1,Why am I the last to receive a DVD,"January 9, 2007 I would love to rate this movie but I am still waiting to receive my DVD.I know if I want to drive to New York I could get the DVD and have it signed by Artie Lange for the same price minus the delivery charge.I suppose this is the price you pay when you order something 2 months in advance......"
1,W.T.F,"This movie just really blew.This movie is pretty much bench warmers with drunks.Artie should stick to what he is good at,KISSING STERNS A**.I saw some mouth breather said this movie was better then Old School.Come on you got to be kidding me.One more thing what happened to the karate kid is this the best he can do now days."
5,loved it,"I thought it couldn't have been better. Artie is so funny, just turn your brain off and enjoy!"
3,Good for a few laughs,"This movie is about a man who is unemployed, living at home with his mother who continues to live life to it's fullest...at least full on whiskey. Artie Lange plays a man who lives for softball, but hasn't played well in years. Now after letting his temper get the best of him as always, his team may be out of the league forever if they do not try and turn it around. Also featuring Ralph Macchio and Jimmy Palumbo, this is a pretty funny crew. The humor is relatively crude, but still make will make you laugh enough to enjoy at least viewing this once. Onother note, special features are really not that special. Rent this or borrow it, but not a buyer."
4,Artie Lange's Beer League,Thought the movie was freakin helarious! Big fan of Artie's ever since Mad T.V. Loved it.
3,It's Not Bad!,This movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. But it wasn't terrible either. It's an average movie with some admittedly hilarious parts here and there. I can say that I didn't regret my purchase of this movie.
2,Not worth your time.,"Think of your favorite ten comedies, it's probable that Beer League stole jokes from at least nine of them. The only reason I didn't rate the movie with zero stars is that it takes balls to release something this bad."
4,"Saw it at the theater, bought it yesterday","I went to see this film, and laughed all the way through it. I took a friend who had never heard of Artie, and he laughed harder than I did. The writing is sharp, the jokes are cruel but effective, and portions of the film are so true-to-life that they look almost like a documentary.This movie took a lot of flak from certain critics... who wouldn't know a good time if it bounced a ping pong ball off their head."
2,Beer League,"The product itself is perfect. Just not a fan of the movie. It's too bad, too, because I love Artie Lange."
1,Waste of Money,"My husband had to have this movie because he is a huge Stern fan. This movie was horrible!!! Artie is a really bad actor, the movie stunk!!! Don't waste your money..."
1,Walked out of it in the theater... horrible.,"First lets take out the ""fans"" who say this is great because they like Stern and want to hear Artie be happy; Rotten Tomatoes has this ranked at 27% for Critics and 33% for users... it doesn't get much worse than that for a movie with some decent people in it.Saw the movie when it came out and it was so predictable, so unoriginal and just horrible that we walked out and we were not the only ones doing so. It was so bad that I wasn't surpirsed that it never made it to a nationwide release. I saw it because I'm a Stern fan, I walked out because I'm a bigger fan of comedy.Artie is funny, his stand up is very good (he is not one of the great ones, but he is way above average) so this movie being horrible is not his fault; it is a shame they put his name on it but they were hoping for the Stern fans to imbrace it... even they didn't.Save your money, get a couple of Artie's standup DVDs instead and you'll enjoy yourself so much more."
1,Not funny at all,"Artie was funny in Dirty Work, but this movie blows. No wonder it only made 500k. Artie, stick with the Stern Show!!!"
1,"Horrendous, Atrocious, Horrible...See where this is going?","Artie Lange...It must have been the Whiskey talking! Beer League is undoubtedly one of the worst films ever produced. The acting is third rate and the talent is D-List, at best. Ralph Macchio is alive and a supporting actor to Artie Lange...Dude, time to hang it up.Plot: Lovable Slob/Loser who lives at home with his mom takes on high school rival (greasy haired guido/lothario) for the rights to stay in their softball league.Pros: None, except for seeing ""The Pitching Machine"" in action.Cons: Everything...especially acting, dialogue, casting...etc.Bottom Line: Skip this one and start your own beer league."
3,Knockoff,"I generally like silly movies. Barring a few funny lines, this movie basically goes nowhere. It seems as though the writers had a good, although unoriginal, premise but quit trying to be funny shortly into the movie. Rent it if your bored but don't expect too much in the way of entertainment."
2,Skip It,"I was glad to have borrowed 'Artie Lange's Beer League' from a friend; I'd have been kicking myself had I actually bought it, because one viewing is enough. It's not the worst film I've ever seen; in fact, I did laugh hard probably a half-dozen times. The problem with the film is Artie Lange himself. It's really nothing more than his stand-up act set on a baseball field. It's crude and offensive, but generally not in a funny way. If you're looking for offensive humor that's actually smart, wait for 'Borat' on DVD.I listen to 'The Howard Stern Show' on Sirius, and really enjoy Artie Lange's contributions to that program. He just doesn't fit the acting mold. Artie's kind of a poor man's John Belushi, in the same way that 'MAD TV' (from which Artie graduated from in the 90's)is a poor man's 'Saturday Night Live' (which made Belushi a star). I wish him well in future endeavors on the big screen, but I hope the results will be better than 'Beer League'."
5,Beer League,Great movie very under rated...Highly recommend to anyone that's a fan of Artie....Reminds me of the ole Porkys movies..
5,Best movie,"Great movie,takes u back to the 80's,artie lang is great in this flick,love the diner scene when the karate kid orders his meal,u will laugh out loud"
4,Old fashioned comedic fun!,"Don't think too much about it, just pop it in and enjoy the ride. If you can put aside all the politically correct filters that have been raised in the last two decades you may just have a good time. Foul? Yes. Rude? That's right. Hilarious? Absolutely. But remember, just because you find it funny doesn't mean you agree with it."
2,ABOUT WHAT I EXPECTED!,"I had never heard of this film, but finding it in my local bargin bin for a few bucks....I couldn't resist picking it up. It's about what I expected for my money. It's an OK romantic/comedy which is heavy on the low brow humor and light on the romance. The cast does what it can with what it has to work with. Ralph Macchio has seen better days,but it was good to see him in this harmless, goofy movie. The DVD transfer looks good and the are some extras to fiddle through."
2,Pretty Bad,"I am a Howard Stern fanatic and a softball fanantic. I couldn't go wrong with this movie, right? Wrong! It is pretty bad. I was disappointed with Artie's project. Gross jokes terrible acting. There are a couple of funny scenes. Wait until it is on sale!"
2,Beware Stern Fans....,"I am a huge fan of Howard Stern's radio show. Even though I am not particularly fond of Artie Lang's contribution to the radio show I wanted to see this film due to Stern's saying he laughed alot of lot when he watched it. I really wanted to like this film but unfortunately it was pretty bad. It has been 2 weeks and I still wonder how is it such a bad film gets made and break even.I give it 2 stars because I was able to endure the film but I was not enjoying it and the end could not come soon enough. It wasn't so bad that I had to turn it off before the end BUT I definitely wouldn't have been oppossed to it.Bottomline- If you are ""curious"" about this film and would like to see the film as I did, sure, that's fine...but if you are looking for more than fulfillment of your curiosity then don't bother. Then on the other hand if you are a Lange fan you will see it no matter what I say so hope you like it."
4,A Stern Fan,"I did not see this movie in the big house......I heard it sucked and I would hate Artie cause of this really bad movie. Well I got the dvd and watched it....I laughed from beginning to end. This thing is FUNNY!!!! It's better than ""Private Parts"""
1,terrible,"I love artie on Howard, but he and Frank didn't put any creative energy into the script. Every joke was obvious. I don't regret buying it, but I won't watch it again"
2,Artie could have done better.,"Artie is hilarious on the Stern show, but this movie was so low budget and thrown together it just didn't work.The jokes were very forced and usually not funny.I love Artie to death, but he should stick to what he is good at: eating and being hilarious on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Satellite Radio."
4,great and funny movie,artie lange is cool and funny reminds you of the days when a dork and get one over on the star player..
4,artie lange,"i liked it, it was alot better than i thought it would be. yes the acting wasn't all that great but the storyline was good, and there are lots of oneliners. so i say it's worth it."
1,Love Artie On Stern? You'll Hate This Movie.,"As a 20 year Stern Fan, and someone who loves Artie's sense of humor (most of the time), I could not watch this DVD all at one time, or even finish it...I scanned it a lot as the dialog and acting were unbearable. And I wanted to like this flic so much.Profanity can be very funny, but one has to have some sense of how and when. There's none of that thought here, just endless F-words, from charcters you would never associate with, much less relate to. I think Artie's appearnces on Letterman are some of his best, and he's actually funnier when he knows he can't curse.I sure hope he finds someone who knows about scripting a comedy when he does that pilot for Fox.....As for this DVD, it's a very painful viewing experience. I gave it one star, because the DVD case is reusable."
1,"So bad, you'll want to stab yourself!!","Don't waste your time or the little bit of money watching this low budget, crap festival. I've seen funnier super 8 home movies."
4,Good travel item,"Small bottles, but convenient for carrying in a purse. They don't hold much, but can be refilled..."
3,expensive for size,"Although the flavors are good, I thought the price was high. The 4 bottles are very small which make it easy as a take along sweetner/flavor. I see prices have lowered since the time I purchased mine."
3,Flavored Stevia,Liked this because it gave me a chance to use several flavors and not have to buy something I would not use.
3,sweetner,"I got this for coffee and water. It was okay but the flavor was not really that great. And I am a chocolate fan. Maybe it was just me, but I would not order again."
4,Like,"These are good but they all taste very similar. I think negative reviews are from people trying to use this to substitute soda or sweet beverages. If you are using it to flavor water, or lightly sweeten tea, you will be very happy."
2,Should change the description- Not in a Tin,I like the product but am disappointed that it said it was in a tin and it is in a cardboard box
2,Eh...,I didn't like these very much. The flavors are not very good and have a strange aftertaste. I might try other flavored brands but won't buy these again.
2,Dont work as great as I thought,"I heard these were the ned BIG thing in sweeteners, well I tried them with club soda (as there is no sugar in it) and I added what it said and it didnt taste like anything... just like you added normal sugar into club soda... no lemon flavor or strawberry. Bleh!"
3,It's ok,Trial size versions that are a good value for the money. It's worth the expense to see if you like it.
3,Some of the flavors are good;,"I liked the chocolate raspberry and the vanilla creame the best. The other two flavors are valencia orange and lemon. Both taste horrid especially the valencia orange. However, I'm going to reorder the first two in their bigger (2oz) size. The stevia comes in a small white dropper bottle (the kind they use to put eye-drops in so it is easy to squeeze the liquid out) and there is no tin container, only a cardbord box but I did not need the box, so that did not bother me.I've been using stevia by Sweet Leaf for a while now and I usually get their unflavored liquid, the powder in little sachets + their english toffee flavored stevia - they all taste excellent."
5,Chocolate and Raspberry,Love this product because my favorite is chocolate and raspberry. I add it to water so I can have it all the time I want flavored water.
2,No flavor,"I enjoy all sweet leaf stevia products, i have every flavor, I bought these to enjoy when I am out, however, they have no flavor what so ever. Very disappointed"
3,Beth,"The bottles are very small, but they will go a long way if you only use a few drops (and that's really all you need) at a time. I wish there were other sampler packs with some of the other flavors. I noticed that I don't really get a lot of the actual advertised flavor in my foods and drinks, more or less just a little sweetness. Probably plain stevia would do the same thing."
2,Disappointment,"I bought these small sizes to test the flavors to see what I liked. Well, I didn't like any of them. There is no flavor! I put them in my water to help give it some zip, went up to 12 drops and there was no flavor whatsoever. Won't be buying this again."
4,great way to try 4 flavors for the price of 1!,I discovered I don't really love the taste/aftertaste of Stevia but I do like the vanilla creme in my coffee. I am happy to have tried many flavors instead of having to buy several full-size bottles. FYI: they suggest they be kept in the fridge.
3,"Good sweetener, but not a lot of choc/rasp flavor","It's handy to have a liquid stevia sweetener. This sweetens just fine, but the chocolate & raspberry flavors don't really come forth in coffee. Still a pretty good buy."
3,This is a good liquid sweetner.,"I enjoyed using this product in various smoothies but I still prefer Splenda. I do like that it came in different flavors. I was using it in conjunction with a diet that did not work out well for me so that might also be a reason why I probably will not reorder it. Still, I really had no problems I just prefer to use another sweetner."
4,Trial pack,"I like the trial pack, but was a little disappointed that it didn't come in a tin for travel. Nice quality product."
1,"The ""tin"" is not a tin.","I enjoy Sweetleaf Stevia and use it often. However, I bought this product because we will be doing some traveling and thought storing the stevia in the ""tin"" (as advertised) would be safer and more advantageous than letting it lie loose in my purse. However, the ""tin"" is a thin cardboard box. I think the word ""tin"" should be removed from this product. IN my opinion this type of false advertising descredits the Sweetleaf company."
1,Not one of them are worth it,"These Sweetleaf ""flavored"" products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor (you probably won't even be able to tell which one it is). If you're looking for a product that's about half sweetness and half flavor, THIS ISN'T IT. I urge you to save your money and look for another solution."
1,"I wanted the TIN,",I wanted the tin to keep my drops in...........I just got is a lousy cardboard box!! but I love the drops
4,Excellent Results,"Buttons has had two BAD pancreatitis attacks. Since starting this product he has only had one mild attack. His BMs are the healthiest I have ever seen. This product is REALLY doing the job for him. Not only that, Dr.Goodpet's Digestive Enzymes were MUCH less expensive than the many others on the market."
1,Not what it's cracked up to be.,We had been giving our dog Pancreved powder which was much more costly than the Dr. Goodpet enzymes. Many of the reviews stated that Dr. Goodpet worked even better than the prescription strength enzymes so we thought we'd give it a try. Within 2 days of giving Dr. Goodpet to our dog he had relapsed into having 6-7 bowel movements a day and they were very loose and watery. We immediately went back to giving him the Pancreaved and things got straightened out so he was only have 2 solid bowels movements each day. I do not recommend changing from the prescription strength enzymes to the Dr. Goodpet if you are having success with the prescription medication. The money saved is not worth the negative effects the change may have on your pets health and well being.
5,Worth every penny,"We have used this for all our dogs over the years. Our Rottweiler lived to be 17 years old, an unheard of age at our vets office. Our pugs passed away at 15 and 18 years old after we used this with them their whole life . We currently use it for our pugs and they are spunky little buggers even though they are well into their teens. We use this plus Missing Link and I can't imagine stopping. Every time we go to the vet they comment that whatever we are doing we need to keep it up because it obviously works."
3,"A good collection of interviews, but needed more commentary.","Since so little literature outside of fanzines exist on this sub-culture, it is great that someone went to these lengths to interview key members of bands involved in making straight edge so big in the mid-late 80's. The book is OK for capturing the straight interviews, but could have done so much more with commentary and perspective from the author, who seems to have some very well-thought and well-phrased words to put on paper when she opts to (limited to the intro). For those who know nothing about the subjects, the book will mean very little, and does not aim to educate. But for those interested in the music (both old and young), this book should be of interest, though it may depress you to find out how limited the subjects' approach to music and life was. I'm just glad to see something like this in print."
2,Good SxE history.,THis is fairly interesting book on the Straight Edge phenomenon. It's simply OK. Not well put together and mostly interviews put to paper. Anyone want to buy my copy?
4,faster than promised!,"The book is a textbook, so it doesn't matter if I like it. I needed it for class but all local stores were sold out. I ordered this book and got it in the mail 2 days latter on three day shipping. Awesome service! The price was the same as other places."
1,Warning - Not for consumers,"I am sure there is nothing wrong with this memory, but be advised that it is NOT for the consumer market; it includes error correction code (ECC) and so it is not supported by most personal and business computers. It is intended solely for servers. I have contacted the vendor and await their response."
4,Worth it for one song,"This album is worth it for just ""the city sleeps"". The rest of the album is ok, not his best effort, but this one song is amazing."
4,Not my usual music,"While this is not my usual music it has burned an indelible mark and earned a permanent place in my ""man you gotta HEAR this"" section. Not every song is a classic but each has it's own unique story and is well worth hearing. ""City sleeps"" has haunted me since I first heard it on a college radio station in 1991. I am glad to have finally found it. You will be too."
4,another good Pagels work,"this is a pretty extensive look at how the gnostics saw Paul and his works. However, this is not a reconstruction of the historical Paul, as the book itself states, but a study of gnosticism and their interpretation, so it is best read with a copy of Paul's authentic letters and a copy of the Nag Hammedi libary close by. And to correct another reviewer( yes I do read other reviews), St.Valetine and Valentinus are not the same individual, Valentinus lived in the second century and St. Valentine died in the year 269. That aside, this a good book for those who are serios about new testament history, but probably not so good for those who are searching for inspiration or spiritual truth."
2,Shrine,"I'd agree with another review above.This CD reeks of the house music sound which destroyed the Style Council.However, it's affordable, and a good collector's item for fans of (Paul Weller and former wife) Dee C. Lee.Paul contributes one of the songs too.Dee C Lee went from Wham! backing vocals to the Style Council, and has also released some solo efforts, of which this is as good a test piece as any to try, before deciding if you want to buy her more expensive albums."
4,Well fought,"Finally delivering on a long awaited full-length promise, this compactly quirky instrumental metal is an audible feast for progressive headbangers searching for tricky textures to get lost inside of."
5,4 thumbs up,"Battles Mirrored album is great through and through. Intense instrumentals backed up occasionally by abstract sounding lyrics. It is very up beet and gives a manic feeling when I listen to it. There is enough complex sound that it compels you to pay attention. Buy the album, you will not regret it. If you're not sure about it just check them out on Myspace; the CD is everything and more"
5,Genius.,One of the most intelligent and thought provoking albums of this decade. Pure genius. Mirrored is one of the few (sort of) instrumental albums I can listen to and really get into. There is not a moment on it devoid of excitement and imagination.
2,Surrender,"Post-rock, or in this case the Math-Rock sliver of it, tends to come in two flavors. Either bone dry funk-prog (90 Day Men), or mechanical experiments in dynamics (Slint). Battles works to hollow out what little human elements existed in the latter, and fills in the gaps with a group of noises that would make Dan Deacon or Tom Waits blush. There was no shortage of reviewers who lined up to praise this demented Disney music, so I could be wrong when I say it's not even worth the time you just spent reading this review. Seriously, go buy a 90 Day Men, Slint, or even a Polvo record instead."
4,2.5 stars,"I had to come back to edit my review of after having this album for a while and the hype died down. Tt really doesn't hold up that well after repeated listens. The vocals are for the most part really annoying, with the exception of a few moments here and there. The songs, though having interesting parts and sounds, this is as far as it goes. It sounds just like that, a bunch of weird parts sort of stuck together. They lack any memorable structure. John Strainer's drumming is painfully stiff, especially in the opening track where there's absolutely no dynamics or feel to his afro-pop-esq opening rim shot pattern. Its a beat that should breath and flow with the accents of the song, but instead every note is played at one single volume, making the beat essentially grooveless. The second track is unbearable, I have to skip it every time.In the battle between Battles, and Neo-Don Cab, Neo Cab are the clear winners."
4,Battles on the front lines,"Let me start by saying you have not really heard anything like Mirrored. Well maybe that is a overstatement, but it is a record that is extremely left of center. It sounds like you are in the year 2075 listening to a band fronted by a refined human/robot hybrid expressing feelings that only a robot could understand. I appreciate how deliberate this album is. Mirrored uses technology in a way that retained some seriousness to the music. It doesn't really have the cheeky undertones that you will find with most electronic music. I think they have acheived that b/c they use conventional instruments as well. ""Atlas"" is easily one of my favorite songs of the year and has not escaped my mind yet, with its repetitive drummiing, cartoonish vocals and surprising layers. That song alone is almost worth the purchase. Battles are not for everyone but is for someone."
2,leaves me cold,"for all its innovation and glossy exterior this album ultimately leaves me cold. One part animal collective, one part Warp band--It's a lot of fun for a few days and then I find myself wanting to listen something with a bit more soul and longevity. Enjoyable for a week though."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"this album marks a new level of arbitraryness in what the ""indie"" tastemakers will celebrate as music if not a new level to which music fans will sublimate actual enjoyment for the sake of avant garde fashion statements. tracks 3, 4, and 9 are listenable, the rest generally isn't. they don't know how to write a transition, it's all stop and start. they don't know how to create a rhythmmic flow, the instrumental layers generally seem at odds with each other. this is a mild curiosity at best, far from an artistic statement. in the 90s i didn't have much time for the experimentalism of June Of 44, Shellac, and Sweep The Leg Johnny, but next to Animal Collective, Hella, and Battles I'm starting to get nostalgic for that time when trendy experimentalism didn't veer quite so far from music."
1,Absolutely Unlistenable,"I read so much great stuff about this album, I couldn't wait to hear it. It is absolutely horrible. I honestly have no idea how someone could enjoy this. I guess I just don't get it."
3,little white chair,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 20 month old granddaughter. She loves to rock and this chair was perfect for that.The only negative about the chair is, for me, it is unsightly because there are no plugs included to cover the screw holes, which are a pretty good size.I suggest that the company began including these plugs and I would sure love to have some."
1,The product broke after 5 days of use.,"The rocker was fairly easy to assemble and seemed sturdy. We gave this to our granddaughter on Christmas day. Unfortunately, one of the runners broke on the 29th after only 5 days of use! For $60 you'd expect a quality product, but not so with this child's rocking chair. Extremely disappointed with this purchase and would definitely not recommend anyone purchase it. I don't think it's safe for a child's use considering one of the rocking runners snapped in two creating a potential safety hazard to the child. Good thing an adult was present."
4,Love it!,This item arrived before promised and was exactly what I ordered. It was the perfect gift. It is a good quality item that I would recommend to anyone.
1,not rocking,"The chair came, box sealed with box and contents in good condition. Everything was in the box except the rockers. Without rockers, it is not much as a rocking chair. I suppose if we put some plastic covers on the feet that would go in the rockers, it might be a nice little chair to sit in."
3,overall good except sticks horribly,"Makes great popovers, but they indicate to use butter in the cups and they stick horribly. Have to carefully pry them out with a thin spatula to remove them intact and it's almost impossible. That's very annoying and disappointing, but otherwise it's a decent pan."
5,Know your smoke points,"I ruined my first pan by cooking at too high a temperature (475F/246C) with vegetable oil. Most oils break down at this temperature, causing the popovers to become badly stuck to the pan. I now cook the popovers at 375F/190C and haven't had any problems."
5,Love it,"Pop overs are so much fun to make, I just need more recipes than just the basic. Product works great, no sticking."
3,Plaque may be called non-stick but needs pan spray,"I bought two 6-cup Chicago Metallic popover plaques and the 12-cup plaque. I am an experienced baker and have been making popovers for more than three decades; they always worked in my 12-cup muffin tins that I either sprayed with baking spray or greased with Crisco. Perfect, no sticking.The new plaques from Chicago metallic do create beautiful popovers (depending on the recipe, the heat of the oven, and the experience of the baker), and are crisp, brown, and delicious. But this morning as usual my gorgeous popovers stuck to the sides of the cups of the Chicago Metallic plaque (though I had put 1/2 tsp melted butter in the bottoms of the cups as directed). Do not believe the hype, even non-stick pans need pan spray."
5,Great Popover Pan!,"We have really enjoyed this popover pan. It was purchased to accompany our first popover pan as our family grew and we needed to make more popovers at once. Surprisingly, the original popover pan (a different brand) purchased from a ""designer kitchen store"" started falling apart, and now we own two of these pans. It has taken us a while to find the perfect recipe...ours is a mix of several we have tried. For one batch (6 popovers): Heat oven 410 degrees. Whisk 1 cup flour, 3 eggs, 1 cup milk and 2 tbsp oil. Do not overwhisk. Once oven is to temp, spray pan cups with cooking spray. Divide batter into the 6 cups. We bake for ~ 26 minutes (convection oven). This seems to make a slightly crunchy exterior with a soft chewy interior. Top with your preference but we love butter and honey! Enjoy!"
5,A great addition to the kitchen!,I purchased this Chicago Metallic Gourmetware Popover pan and have been making popovers once or twice a week! They turn out perfect and clean-up is very easy. I didn't follow the recipe that comes with the pan...I have my own and it's easier than the one that they include. They turn out wonderful and I would recommend this product to others. The price was reasonable.
5,Best Popovers in the world,"With out a doubt, the best popovers in the world. I have 3 different recipes and the one that comes with the pan is the best. If you love large buttery popovers this is the pan for you. And the quick and easy cleaning is always a great plus."
5,Practically Perfect,Practically perfect in every way. Use the recipe that comes with the pan. This really is a five star product. The pan and my popovers were flawless. Crazy!!! I loved the results and you will too.
5,"Tried other brands, this is the best!","This would be my third popover pan - it was so far above the brands (and I won't name them but they are well-known) that I bought another one. Heavy, truly quick release, and well-constructed, it is worth much more than what I paid for it! A big thank you to Chicago Metallic for this quality product."
5,perfect popovers,I think Americas Test kitchen recommended these pans ....These pans with the ATK recipe produce as good a popover as I have ever had. Excellent!!!
2,Dissapointed,"After reading other reviews about this book, I thought it would be a great addition to use. After reading the book I found out otherwise. The directions on building the jigs is very poor for beginners. The tune up sections you can find on the internet for free or get from the forums. It was a waste of my money."
1,Not Impressed,I was disappointed with this book. There are much better books on the market - Table Saw Magic - for example.
4,for your info,"This cast iron Dutch Oven does not have the spiral bail that is advertised in the full product description. Other than that, I am looking forward to many years with my new Dutch Oven."
3,Good pot,I gave this only three stars because of the lid--all those tips that provide the self-basting are a pain to season. The pot itself has performed wonderfully for me.
4,Good oven for the price,Pro: Excellent cooker. Prepared food tastes great from oven. Great product support from vendor after burning food onto bottom of oven.Cons: Must prep oven. Can burn food if not careful.
1,Poor Service,I purchased a book from this seller in Jan 2010 and never recieved it. This seller made NO effort to correct this situation.
5,Great Bag!,I bought this for a spring camping trip above the grand canyon. I strapped it to the back of my dirt bike and went 300 miles off road with it. It help up well and the compression sack made it small enough for my bike. It was comfortable and too warm at 50 degrees. Should be good into the 40s. Seems well built.
3,"Good, with some flaws","I was challenged and happy with this book of sudoku until I reached the special ""Giant Sudoku"" section at the end. This section features a 12x12 sudoku grid in which you are meant to fill in the numbers 1-12. However, the initial setup includes the number 13 in all puzzles!Other than that, the book provides a nice ramp up from easy to challenging."
4,Sudoku Easy to Hard,Great book to challenge anyone. I left it on the coffee table and my 23 year old son picked it up and found it very engrossing. For anyone who wants to keep sharp with numbers these puzzles help stimulate the mind.
4,"No symetry true, but fun otherwise!","It is true that the puzzles do not have the typical Sudoku symetry, and technically that's a core element of a Sudoku puzzle. But that doesn't mean they aren't fun and that the book is not very well organized.Many times, Sudoku books do a poor job of assigning difficulty levels, but this book does a great job of ranking the difficulty. Also, the overview section in the front was a great primer for beginners, and my wife liked it so much, she got addicted too (NPR's Puzzlemaster Will Shortz was a great choice to write this!!).My only real complaint is that the paper is very thin, so some of my ink pens bled through the page which made the puzzles on the other sides of the pages a little hard to read. So I simply use a lighter pen, and it works fine.Also, the book is a little smaller than other Sudoku books, so it works well for travelers on flights (takes up less room in a carry-on bag!!!)."
4,Great book!,"This is one of the first books I tried when first learning to do Sudoku puzzles. It is an excellent one, with good sized puzzles, somewhat difficult for a novice, but that is the challenge! I would definitely recommend it!"
4,Sudoku for everyone,"I love doing these puzzles so much I wish there were more than 100 in this book. I found the easy ones easy, but not ridiculously easy. I like the medium ones. I have not done the difficult yet, but I look forward to them. Even though there are only 100 puzzles in this book, it has taken me a while to work my way through it. Will Shortz is the best."
5,Sudoku Easy to Hard: good variety of puzzles,"This book's puzzles are a lot more difficult than the ones you see in your daily newspaper. Working a sudoku puzzle does get easier as time goes on, however, so take heart.One tip I can share is to put a letter in the corner of each square to help you remember in what order you filled it in. I start with 'a', go on through 'z', then to 'aa' and so on to 'zz', and then to 'aaa'. That way, when I find a mistake, I only erase the squares that I filled in after the mistaken square.Good luck and happy solving!"
3,Capitol Falls Short,"Great voice, great songs, great musical backing!!! However, Capitol Records, please re-release this classic lp on CD by itself, and make it 24-bit remastered. I find that the vocals are mixed under the music, and the volume has to be turned way up to hear it audibly. Do Nat's memory justice and do this one over. I had a similar problem a few years ago with Billie Holliday's Lady in Satin CD. They re-issued it in 24-bit and the sound quality blew me away!!! Please do right by us loyal Nat King Cole fans."
4,The 1st album gets 4.5; the next one 3.5,"WHERE DID EVERYONE GO is a solid album for the most part. The singing is superb and the arrangements are top notch. Noone could write for strings like Gordon Jenkins.Here is my only gripe: Some of the songs are lightweight and not timeless standards. The best cuts are : SAY IT ISN'T SO, AM I BLUE and WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG.Frankly, I was never a big fan of Nat's attempts to try to sing rock n'roll and/or more commercial material. His singing is good but the depth is lacking in the songs. Nat was essentially a balladeer who could also swing hard.Overall, this is a nice package. You get 2 for one and I was very happy with that."
4,"2 lps, 1 great, 1 mediocre, on 1 great CD","""Where Did Everyone Go?"" gives you 12 of the finest vocals by anyone in song history, all in one achingly sad work. Listen in a dark, quiet, lonely room. Its drama and atmosphere will haunt you. All strings and the King's awesome voice. The sound is marvelous stereo. There should have been more like this, but this is it. Cherish it. ""Looking Back"" gives you some random tracks, mostly of a slight early R&B/rock slant and all overdubbed with extra rhythm stuff. Those songs aren't so great. The overdubs are dumb. The sound is mediocre. Listening to Nat though, is always great. Consider them wonderful bonus tracks for a great album. Get it. Nat King Cole Rules."
2,in real it looks different,"well, it looks good at the picture, but in real it looks worse. the colours are different a bit, and the red one is too annoying. PLUS the ""Iceland"" thingie is white and the border of the whole thing is white as well, not yellow. liars :)."
2,This Book Offers No New Insights,"This book, written by and for Australian hardboiled crime writers, offers no insights on writing that you couldn't find in a dozen other mediocre books on writing. Nigel Krauth's advice (p.111) that you should know what it feels like to knife a constable or ""to rape an eight-year-old"" is sick-making. Cozy readers steer clear of this one."
3,"Ok, but could have been better ...","some of the licks here are also in Jean Marc's ""advanced scale concepts and licks for guitar"" (which I thought was kind of lame) in this (very) short book Jean Marc tries to teach thru examples only, almost no explanations, very short on theory, just a line or two outlining what's going on ... but still I thought the lines presented are quite good, so I think this skinny book is cool as a supplement but you'll have to analyze the licks yourself to get the most out of the ideas presented here (which is not a bad thing really considering sometimes you obtain a deeper understanding when a book makes you work) almost every lick is in a jazz fusion vein, some are better than others ... what I liked about this one is how Belkadi mixes dimished sounds with more standard chords, so he applies the scale but doesn't really sound diminished like in a 13th flat 9 chord ... while not essential I didn't regret I bought it, just don't expect too much material."
1,Very Unclear,"I bought this and this authours slap and pop books. Both are very dissapointing. The guitar tone on this cd is terrible, the examples are unclear and I cant hear what is being played. The guitar has a lot of effects on it, when I try to learn from the book I dont even know where to start."
1,"Great, until it fails","This microwave was good enough till it failed 3 1/2 months into use - at that time, Target would no longer take it back and I had to call Emerson, who wanted me to pay for shipping and wait several weeks to get it back! Forget it - I went and bought a Sharp instead, which has worked thus far."
1,Made in China,"This microwave worked great for 10 months, then it died. Easier to buy a new one than to go through all the trouble of packaging it up and paying UPS 1/3rd the purchase price of the thing to send it back to the manufacturer, then wait for weeks to get it back."
2,Sand? More like dirt.,"I've been using this sand for quite awhile for my hamsters, and my most recent box has an awful texture to it! It's like dirt now, and it has an almost damp feeling to it. It's very unpleasant, and my hamster seems to agree. With the dampness I'm feeling, I'd imagine it would actually be unsafe for chinchillas.After a little digging, it seems like this isn't just a bad box. Super Pet has actually changed the sand. But why? Why change something that was perfect? They have the only Chinchilla Sand that is sold in most US stores, and they ruined it. Super Pet ruined one of the few decent products they actually produce. I guess they just want to continue their reputation for being a pet company that makes mostly bad, low quality and unsafe pet products."
3,Dusty,"Even though the products description says dust free, the sand is actually very dusty. We got this for our hamsters and they don't seem too excited about i, they will dig around but they do not roll around in it as we expected. The other reviews seems out of date, maybe the product has changed recently."
4,Chinchilla sand,"I bought 4 boxes of chinchilla sand, saving about 1.00 per box as compared to the pet stores. Box arrived in good shape but a box within had come loose. Product did not spill out but the broken box (holding 5packets) was an inconvenience. Still recommend buying this way though."
1,Do not use if you love your chin cuddly soft!!,"I rescued a chin who that came with this sand that was used for his dust baths.. The person who owned him didn't know any better, but this made his fur so coarse and horrible to touch! The chin looked a mess and I threw this out immediately!! Almost a month later, his fur is still recovering from the sand. Do not buy SAND for your chins to bathe in. Also, make sure the dust you buy is unscented as well- chins have been known to get respiratory problems from that. The best dust to buy is Blue Cloud or Blue Sparkle, almost all knowlegeable breeders will tell you this."
1,Not suitable for chinchillas,"Chinchillas should be provided with bathing 'dust', not 'sand'.The best is Blue cloud or Blue sparkle. Kaytee chinchilla dust is better to use than this."
5,STUNNING AND SCARY AS HELL,"This book is one of the few that has managed to keep me - a dedicated reader - up at nights, and as such it is one of the few that I would like to read again. If you can't get a new copy of the novel, do yourself a favor and pick up a used one. If you are a fan of intense, intelligent horror you owe yourself a reading of this great work.As a man too young to serve in the Vietnam War but being a history buff, I think that this novel - combined with DEAR AMERICA: Letters Home From Vietnam - is the closest I will ever come to experiencing what some poor veterans have suffered through.This is not kids horror a la TWILIGHT ... this is the real deal. Get ready to get scared."
2,"Downhill after ""In Ohio""","Joseph Arthur's latest effort substantially lacks the sublime ambience of his previous endeavors. One can listen to ""In Ohio"" over and over and over while continuously marveling at its beauty. It's terribly unfortunate that no other song on this album emanates a similar raw, aesthetic element which is immediately apparent on Arthur's past travels."
3,I will wait for you Joseph,"I suspect I'd enjoy this album better if I hadn't seen Joseph perform most of these songs live in a much more stripped down haunting manner. ""Can't Exist"" is the most obvious casualty of the overproduction here, making it for me at least almost unlistenable. There is just something a bit too slick about how this album was produced as if someone was afraid of how stark the material is so they decided to sweeten it. ""I Am"" is another one that worked quite beautifully live and seems almost hokey on the album, which is a shame as it is almost Beckettian in its clarity. Still some great songs but too much gloss."
4,Really great micro-crystal litter!,"#2 on my list for ScoopFree + Forever litter tray compatible litters! Litter Pearls Micro is #1, but it's a tad more expensive... For similar results and less $$, I'd totally recommend The Ultimate Cat & Kitten Litter.Good odor control, economical (for crystal litter), 4lbs bags are easy to store in my small apt, and it lasts ~ 3-4 weeks depending on the age/size of your cat. I used it in an experiment to find the best litter for the ScoopFree without having to buy the EXPENSIVE disposable trays... I loved that it was soft on his paws (it's not chunks), and I *barely* had to stir it. My Siamese took to it with no problem and even likes to play in his litter box when I put a fresh pouch in! The only negative with the litter is a minor cosmetic flaw; it turns progressively yellow-er as it becomes used (although, one could say that makes it a wonderful indicator!)."
4,Great thrash-tinged power metal,"This is the first album I've bought from Ancient Rites and it was well worth the money. Power metal is not a very innovative genre, but the thrash and even death-infused power metal crafted by Ancient Rites is fresh and enjoyable. Though much of the album features orchestration, it avoids the sometimes tacky metal-meets-Broadway trappings of so much of the genre. The playing on here is quite solid, as is the songwriting. The songs are certainly not avant-garde in terms of structure, but they are catchy. As a historian and consummate geek, I also appreciate the historical subject matter of the lyrics. The gruff but not growled vocals aren't half bad, either."
4,I'm happy!,"Just got the DVD and i'm very happy with the purchase. It came as advertised, not in mint condition but not all scratched up and messy either.I'm happy with my purchase and would make more purchases from this seller in the future."
5,Love Chris Rock!,I had a hard time finding this in stores. I love Chris Rock's stand-up and this does not disappoint.
5,A hilarious stand-up comic's view of life.,"Chris Rock's special ""Bring the Pain"" is an entertaining and hysterical take on life. His use of comical analogies and off-beat observations establishes him as one of the funniest stand-up comedians of his time. His recent Emmy award for this video skyrocketed his popularity and he now enjoys a greater portion of the public eye. His HBO show, ""The Chris Rock Show"", also a well deserved hit, shows this comic's brilliance. This special not only entertained me, but made me laugh so hard I cried. Chris Rock's stand-up comedy is well worth the price because his hilarity is gargantuan compared to the other comedians of today. END"
2,Not nearly as good as Never Scared or Bigger & Blacker,"I'm such a huge Chris Rock fan that I had to see everything that he has done. I guess this was his first HBO special and to me, it really showed. He has evolved so much as a comedian over the last decade that his early material seems weak and pales in comparison. About thirty minutes into the show I wanted to turn it off, but having paid full price for the dvd I decided to stick it out. Parts are amusing, but in general this show just isn't funny. Save your money, save your time, and see his later HBO specials that are much better."
2,Is Chris Rock the best stand-up comedian ?,"I feel sad when I watch Chris Rock's act. I just don't think he is funny at all. Besides, his stuff is too row and somewhat uncivilized. He cannot manage to say things really funny. To curse and to swear is not funny. It just shows how bad our culture has really gotten. Chris Rock is not helping the American society in any way. Without cursing, swearing, using tasteless racial slogans, he can hardly manage to say anything for more than one minute. Don't get me wrong, I am also a colored person myself. I am travelling in Europe right now. In Bergen, Norway, I went to the Riks Theatre, or National Threatre to watch an amazing stand-up show, which is the best I have ever seen for the last few years in Europe. The best comedian that night was named Remning Cheng or something. You should go to see how Europeans are doing the stand-up show then you will understand what I mean. Here is the web address to the stand-up show I am talking about: [...]"
1,This is NOT Closed Captioned,"Yes this is a valid reason to give it 1 star. its 2007 now if they cant release a new one by now, then they dont care.As you vote to no on me ""not helpfull"", remember what Chris himself went through when he was growing up with racism, and how just before him many black people could not of had the chances he has had.If you dont think these are the same issues, your ignorant. Not Stupid, but ignorant."
1,NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL STANDARDS,"I bought this video because I have enjoyed other works by Chris Rock and own his dvd's. I purchased this one since it is no longer in circulation in retailers.I AM DEAF and rely on captioning to enjoy videos. This product FAILED to provide captioning which has been the LAW since the late 1980's. COME ON HBO! Who did you outsource this to? WHO will take responsibility for not following the law and making sure all your programming is accessible to people with disabilities?I contacted AMAZON to let them know, and they acted as if it was the small vendor's problem!!!HBO, (and Chris Rock's producers for that matter) should KNOW BETTER! Get out of your caves and realize that DEAF people enjoy comedy, too and oh yeah we're not all Marlee Matlin, some of us are BLACK + DEAF!!!!!"
5,He's the best standup comic.,"I love all his standups, but Bring the Pain remains my all-time favorite, and I've seen them all. Can't get over how great it was."
3,Ok tubes...Not for my hamster.,"I was hoping this would be a cheaper solution to adding onto my hamsters cage. (I guess not since they took away prime shipping after I had ordered them) These are good add on tubes for very small mice maybe, I like that they have more of a ""step"" all the way through them to make it easier to climb straight up. My hamster, on the other hand, doesn't get stuck in them like some people have said, but there just isn't enough room for her to freely move around. She has to back up out of them because she can't turn around when she comes to some dead ends. I'll be sticking to the Habitrail accessories.Habitrail Ovo Tube"
3,"good, but I found it cheaper somewhere else","I bought two sets of this to extend my hamster cage. I think with two sets of that, you can definitely build something very creative for your hamster, only one set probably isn't enough."
3,Gerbils are chewing on the joints,"The soft joints in the tubing must be delicious or something - My gerbils have been chewing like crazy on these tubes since my son installed them. We've tried giving them a large variety of other things to chew on, but these seem to be the chew toy of choice. I'll probably end up taking these off before they manage to make a hole in them"
4,Ok nice,"Well its ok but some of the tubes. Fall apart , easily fixed but it shouldn't fall apart anyways while its in there"
5,Great colors,"These are not as bad as some of the other reviews I read. They aren't as hard to put together and take apart as other poeple say. They Do have bright colors and are perfect to connect two or more cagees together, and it came with this bubble end tube which you can connect to a corner tube or a straight tube and make a look out for you hamster. It's really cool to be able to connect anything and everything together.P.S. I use a spoon to diconnect the tudes to save my nails from breaking."
1,Wrong size,I ordered for ferrets and it was entirely to small for ferrets or al least my ferrets and one of them only wieghts a pound.
2,not so much,I thought there might be more tubes but the description did not say how many tubes...You get exactly what is pictured.
2,tubes,"most of the critter trail stuff i had shipped to me, including all tubes, were broken. they were easy to repair, but some are permanently stuck shut now and others fall apart easily. and they're pretty hard to clean."
4,he can't believe it.,my son's robo hamster loves getting out of his cage with these tubes. i think he couldn't belive he was getting out of his house and increasing his real estate with out getting another cage for him.
2,Not Recommended for heavy duty lifting,"Cheaply Made and not a heavy duty Tilter. When Lifting a small block 302 Ford engine, the Tilter flexed and was very hard to crank. The Tilter did work and I have used it a few times, but I can see it wont last much longer, the gear is nearly stipped and almost useless for Tilting."
5,Wonderful,"Recorded Live at The Greek Theatre, this album is a hidden jewel. Merry Clayton (who sang backup on the Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter) is a dynamic singer and performer. The songs 'Overload' and ""Steamroller Blues' are real, from the heart, rockers. Also included in this album is the song 'Cry to me', from the scene in the cabin when the two main characters first make love in the movie. All music is played by ""The Contours"", the original Dirty Dancin' band. Eric Carmen's 3 best songs ever, 'Make Me Lose Control', 'Almost Paradise', and 'Hungry Eyes' have that extra ""live"" excitement to them. This is a great album and a hidden jewel!!! Enjoy!!!"
4,Well written and easy to understand...,I bought this book a month back.Its an amazing book for beginners. Its well written and have good examples.
3,Not a bad book.,It is great for the very basics of C++ and that is all. If you really want to understand C++ you pretty much have to move on. I would instead go with a subscription msdn and with patience you can learn everything you want to there.
1,A bad way to learn Dutch,"""Just Enough Dutch"" so far, is the worst Dutch reference I have come across. The pages look like photocopies, and are quite hard to read. I am just thankful I checked it out at the libarary before buying it."
4,Excellent Primer on Financial Modelling,"I picked up the second edition at the local bookstore and I found myself surprisingly impressed by this book. The author was a banker and does a good job at explaining the concepts and tricks used in financial models.The third edition should include M&A;, LBO and models for different industries besides Commercial & Industrial"
2,Flawed.,"I held very high hopes for this book and was, unfortunately, disappointed. The key limitation that I found was that it relies on so-called plugs to balance the balance sheet in its financial model. I subsequently have spoken to a number of people who work in the world of finance and they all told me this approach is amateurish and highly limited. A half-hour one-on-one tutorial with a former business analyst showed me a far better approach. That tutorial was what I was hoping to get out of this book. By all means read it as an introduction to the area - some aspects are quite good. But you won't walk away with the skills you might be looking for. I didn't."
2,Review,Very practical explanation of techniques to model the balance sheet and related cash sweep methodology. Best available on the market.
2,police story,I found this book very hard to follow. It jumped around so much it did not keep my interest. I put it down after three chapters.
5,Cracking book,Gang warfare amongst teanage gangs. Interspaced with stages of the investigation of 6 gang murders (plus a whole lot more murders by the end of the book) are excerpts of the confession of gang president Randall Nesbitt (who instigated all of the murders) and his justifications that he was trying to bring peace to the neighbourhood. Brilliant as a gang warfare novel and as an allegory of the Vietnam war.
3,"Uneven, but with bright spots","I first became acquainted with Leon Thomas through his work with Pharoah Sanders on the tracks ""The Creator Has A Master Plan"", and ""Prince Of Peace"" (both sublime). On ""Full Circle"", the free jazz experimentation is tempered with a fairly straightforward jazz-funk-pop musical delivery. Though an uneven album, Thomas' voice works well on the beautiful and soulful ""I Wanna Be Where You Are"", and the rolling free-jazz funk of ""Just In Time To See The Sun"" (with Bernard 'Pretty' Purdie on drums). The tracks ""Balance of Life (Peace of Mind)"", and ""It's My Life I'm Fighting For"" are also strong. This may not be the best place to start with Leon Thomas, but if you're already a fan and looking for new material, this album is worth picking up."
3,NIce book.,I thought this would be a great book but was disapointed. The tags don't have any texture on them so my son doesn't really care about it.
3,My First Taggies Book: Sweet Dreams,"It was nice.....and the parents thought it was a thoughtful gift. The baby didn't say a word. On a recent visit though, I noticed this book wasn't as worn as his other cloth books."
2,"So far, not too excited.","We got this for our son when he was about 6 months old, but he has never shown the book much interest. The ""tags"" don't seem to be so exciting for him as other kids. Also our 6 month old daughter doesn't seem to be too interested in this book. It is cute and well made though, and we have had no problems with ripping or anything like that."
2,only 3 pages!,I bought it because my 6 month old was going through a phase where she loves tags.this book was the biggest disappointment. it was only 3 pages. it had 4 tags for each page. my daughter only played with the original tags not the fake ones.plus it looks really ratty after one wash. i would NOT recommend this product. i wish i could return it. my one amazon purchase that i regret.
3,Cute idea,"By the amount of interest my 8 month old gives to tags on everything I though this was a cute idea for a toy. Unfortunately, the tag on this book my son finds the most appealing is the actual information tag! He hardly ever bothers with the other tags on it. I think they should have made the tags bigger, they are a bit small and maybe brighter colors would be better too..."
1,Beware the L'EQUIP 221,"I purchased this model in March 04. It vibrated badly upon arrival, and it took months to get a replacement. Then the replacement juicer vibrated badly, so I contacted the manufacturer, L'EQUIP. L'EQUIP forces you to pay to ship the juicer back to them to fix their problems, and you have to send a check for $10.00 to cover their ""service fee"". I recently recieved the juicer back unfixed, and vibrating badly. The company is still stalling, unwilling to correct this situation. Their warranty, and service are worthless."
1,Where's the Juice?,"The L'Equip juicer is my second juicer. I started off with the Juiceman Jr and fell in love with juicing from my experience with it. I bought this juicer as a step up, but unfortunately, it's been a huge disappointment. I used to juice all the time, but now I rarely do because of this juicer's unacceptable amount of waste. Simply put, the amount of juice extracted by this juicer is woeful at best. I'm looking for juicer #3 and hopefully I have better luck."
2,Utilitarian but not durable,"This is not a heavy duty, commercial juicer. With less than 20 uses, I have already fried the motor (juicing apples) and stripped the plastic bolt that the blade rests on, juicing a mango. I have tried to contact lequip numerous times to exercise my warranty, but I have never heard back from them. I can not recommend this product."
3,Convincing account of the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate,"While the many details present in this work will make it unpalatable for most non-specialists, this work nonetheless offers a highly cogent explanation of the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate. Against traditional arguments attributing the fall to inner conflicts such as provncial and factional unrest, Blankinship attributes the fall to the contradictions inherent in jihad, itself the impetus for the expansion of the political realm of Islam. Jihad proved, eventually, the be not only unsustainable but also deeply self-destructive in the end as it exhausted all of the states resources and tested the loyalty of the state's armies as it continually faced ever more wild and formidable enemies with diminishing returns and profits from bounty. Blankinship, in the end, gives a convincing argument that Hisham b. abd al-Malik's reign was not the height but was rather they beginning of the fatal decline of the Umayyad dynasty."
3,Meh.,"This movie was ok. Honestly, I thought Bret and Jemaine were going to have a much bigger role in this film. Jemaine is in it for one scene, which last maybe 2 minutes. and Bret is in several scenes but for about 15 seconds apiece. The movie itself was really strange, but I like strange so it was fine. Probably wouldn't have purchased it if I knew bret and jemaine weren't really in it."
3,Could've Been Better,"The DVD arrived in the time alloted. However, upon opening the case, the disc fell out. The little spoke things that are supposed to hold it in don't work, so I always have to be careful it doesn't scratch."
2,no,"I'd have to say that I disagree with these other reviews. I thought this album was a poor attempt at grindcore. It tried to be, but fell short, even the melodic parts were horrible. These people have no idea how to write music."
5,Amazing.,"The Number Twelve Looks Like You, hailing from New Jersey puts together a masterpiece of music. It blends death metal, hardcore, grindcore, jazz, and experimental. Sometimes, all in the same song. The musicians are stupendous, every instrument is very well recorded and mixed. I would recommend this to fans of many -core and metal genres."
3,MEDICORE.......,"I don't know why but I expected more.....a bit too dated & the recording wasn't clear/good.I am a ""Lionel Richie"" fan however, this CD was/is not his best.Suzanne"
3,Just OK Alternate History,"Swanwick is an all-to-infrequently published author. However, ""Jack Faust"" is not his best work.The story is well-written. Swanwick is an accomplished writer. Yet, I never felt any kinship with any of the book's characters. In addition, the pace of the story is very ""choppy"". You are required to wade through page after page of meta-mystical metaphores, before coming upon scenes that are like nuggets of gold.If you have a hankering to read this author, pass this one up and read ""Vacuum Flowers"" instead."
5,it is the best book i have read in my entire life.,jack faust is the best book in the markets toda from cover to cover it engrosses the reader in its marvel. i invite anyone who thinks otherwise to debate it with me.
1,Fixed zero of my problems.,"No better than the drive that was already in my XBox. I was trying to fix my XBox's disc read error problems. This drive did NOT fix the problem. I wasted my money with this purchase. The drive works just as well as the one that originally came with my XBox. Still won't play many of the games correctly. Still won't play many DVDs at all. In my opinion, it's a piece of crap and a waste of money."
4,Keepin' it real,"King eschewed the clutter of his cookie-cutter comic strip contemporaries in the 1920s by taking a minimalist path, using simple line and lots of white space that leads the eye. His content was also ground-breaking: characters that aged in real time. Gasoline Alley evolved from a single panel gag-a-day about cars to a gentle continuity strip of middle class family life that can still be enjoyed today. King's back-story bio, complete with family album snapshots, prove that he was mirroring his life through his art. I'm anxious for the next volumes."
5,Walt and Skeezix Book 1,Walt and Skeezix is one of my husbands favorites and he was thrilled to get this book for Christmas. So glad I was able to find it on Amazon.
2,"S'alright, not the best","Its a good game to play then ignore for a while and come back to when you have nothing else to do. But its not engaging enough to hold your attention for too long. There's no customization except of the dungeon. There is definitely no replay value, and when you get to the higher levels its annoying when you have to replay the lower levels of the dungeon because you HAVE to have something in order to continoue on or fight your foe. Graphics aren't the greatest, either, but you'd hope the storyline would help but it doesn't. Just not the best game."
2,Dungeon Architect needed...,"An addictive dungeon crawler. If you ever took the time to design and draw out mazes on graphing paper for your home or after school DnD campaigns with friends, you are going to love this game. Design your own multi-level dungeon and wait for the baddies to come. Real time combat set in your dungeon.For me I am not that detail oriented nor do I care to be creative. I only gave it 2 stars because I wanted something dungeon related but not this much... others will undoubtedly give it 5+ stars because it will appeal to them more than me."
2,I had never saw this movie.,"I think that is a good real story and a good movie, but this japonise blue ray has in the back of the box, the three zones: A,B,C. I have a LG blue ray, free zone and this blue ray doesn,t play in my blue ray. I don,t understand. If you are in Europe don,t buy this blue ray."
2,"Not terrible, but not great","Most of the time, even in relatively strong wind, this kite has a difficult time staying in the air. It'll fly for a while, but the balance is relatively poor, so it likes to take fast trips straight to the ground with little or no notice. :\ Oh well. It's pretty. Just not the best kite."
2,No sense of urgency,"Product was shipped out promptly, but unfortunately it never showed up to MY SHIPPING ADDRESS. The item was shipped USPS first class mail, when I checked the tracking number, all it said was the zip code and town it was shipped to. There was no address or even a signature of who signed for the package. Basically, I was told to call the Post Office myself and find it."
3,It's not made in Germany and it's not dishwasher-safe,"This pan did a OK job. It's made in China instead of made in Germany as Amazon describes. The recipe that came with it is not very accurate (only in metric measurements). My first batch of Madeleines turned out too brown on the bottom, very white on the top.Also note it's NOT dishwasher-safe. You have to wash it by hand."
4,"Good, reliable madeleine pan","like most of the other reviewers, i liked this pan, and madeleines are super easy to make. the pan itself is fairly nonstick, and lightweight. i didn't try the recipe on the packaging, but in using the recipe i found on the epicurious website, i also felt the need to reduce the bake time. i think this is mainly the result of the pan being really dark.the picture make it look gray, but it's more black in color. as with other nonstick dark pans, i've found the need to reduce the baking time. otherwise, great product, can't complain. and if you make these in volume, i'd invest in two of them."
5,Tried it and loved it.,I have been looking for a madeleine pan for a long time. Most were too thinor cheap feeling. This one had some weight to it and cooked very even.
1,Looks lovely but not good for baking,Should have known that black pans are not good for baking! When the minimum bake time is over the part of the cookies in contact with the pan will be too dark... almost appear burnt. Buy a light colored pan even if it doesn't look as pretty.
5,Mini sized bread,"We love this mini-loaf baking tray. By making six small banana-nut bread, we can give some away to friends and relatives. We have also made miniature buttermilk loaves."
2,disappointing,There aren't many books about groundhog's day out there and unfortunately this one doesn't live up to much. The illustrations are colorful and full of detail but the story ends by the groundhog getting revenge on his 'friends' who woke him up early. It doesn't seem like a good moral to be giving children.
2,Does NOT work for Rossi Lever Actions,I bought this thinking that my Rossi M92 was considered a type of long gun with a 24 inch barrel...I was wrong. It did not work at all. I had to file the opening wider to get it to fit on the hammer. After I got it to fit it was so bulky the slide couldn't go all the way back when working the lever. Tried turning it upside down but then it prevented the hammer from moving all the way back so it wouldn't cock. This is for SINGLE SHOT RIFLES ONLY!! I ended up putting on my Iver Johnson 410 single shot and it works great there.
1,Romance novel disguised as a southern mystery,"The characters in No Defense are southern stereotypes and the first person narrative is inconsistent. The sub-text is that lower class southerners and the FBI caused the Civil Rights unrest, while the upperclass was not involved. The black characters in this book are servants and cooks and are also stereotypical. What could have been a very good mystery novel turns into a pulp romance with a contrived ending."
1,Junk,This case does not hold the cards securely. The slots for the cards are too loose and the cards fall out easily. They will stay inside the case until you open it. Open carefully because the cards will come tumbling out.
3,SD Holders,"Better than individual plastic cases that SD cards come in. It does not snap well together when shut, but works okay. Opens too easily, so I use rubber bands to make sure they stay shut. The spots for the SD cards generally are okay, but a couple are extremely tight, making it hard to get the SD cards inserted. I'll use them (I bought 3) since I bought them, but I probably would not want to give them as gifts."
3,Durable but not secure,"The case itself is great. Offers protection for enclosed memory cards from the outside however, all cards do not stay in place within the case. The plastic does not hold ALL cards securely. For the price the case is okay."
2,Buy something else...,"I bought 2 of these units and they have been a real disappointment. EVERY TIME I open the metal case, I find that most all of my SD cards are loose and sliding around."
5,None better,"I've tried the rest and this is the best. Holds 8 SD cards vs two or four from other companies, and is still pocket size. Metal case is solid, snaps shut. The rubber insert holds the cards snugly, yet they're easy to remove."
5,SD Card Holders,Great idea and it's nice for people like me that don't erase my SD cards I just save them and buy new one's.
2,Okay but....,The case is probably bomb proof--very solid--but will not secure the the memory cards. When opening to insert or extract a memory card be prepared to have the cards fall out. Otherwise it stores 8 cards.
5,Works as advertised,It just works. Perhaps if the hold cups were a little deeper to give a firmer hold but otherwise I love it. No problems what so ever.
4,Interesting combination,Leon Thomas's musical interpretations are definitely worth a listen. I first head of Thomas's mysterious vocal arrangements on Georgia Public Broadcasting's jazz night with Masani. His voice is very unusual and rooted.
5,Great little vacuum,"I purchased this item primarily to pick up animal fur on the stairs. With two cats and a dog, it was really starting to pile up - and my upright vac was not doing the trick. I had read some pretty poor reviews on a lot of hand-helds with regards to suction power on pet hair, so I was very pleasantly surprised at the amount of hair this was able to pick up. Although it would be nice if it were cordless, the cord was long enough to reach from the bottom to the top of my stairs. It is also great for those smaller jobs, too."
3,good product...poor service from maker,"We used the turbo tiger for 1 week (liked it very much) and then the flexible hose broke in half. So I ordered a new one (no charge) from tristar, the maker. I had to wait three weeks for it to arrive. It was the wrong hose, so I called tristar again and they sent me another, well I got the wrong one again. I gave them one more chance and they again, sent the wrong one. After 9 weeks having a new vacuum and not being able to use it. I decided to send it back. It's been three weeks since my return and I have not gotten a refund. This company has some serious customer service issues."
1,garbage,Do not buy this piece of junk. I have hardly used it and now I won't be using it anymore. The little tiny plastic node that holds the front of the vacuum on decided to just break even though I had not tried to take it off to clean the thing. I was walking through the house with it when the front just dropped off. I thought it just had worked itself loose until I tried to put it back on and that is when I found that half of the plastic node had broken off. How long it had been like that I have no idea. Buy another kind or you can have my broken one.
1,Piece of Junk,This 'thing' didnt last more than 2 months from the time we bought it! the floor attachment was just garbage! It sparks and just completely died for no reason!!
2,Hot Turbo,Was a 4-5 star performer for 9 months. It always ran a bit hot and finally burnt out. I could find no reference to the warranty period. Must be a disposable item.
3,floor attachment????,It's a powerful machine and it works ok!!! I have two dogs and even the hairs are gone with this machine. BUT! the problem is it does not come with the floor attachment(the long one which seems to be an optional) ... I can not get the attachment only from any place else and there's no way that I'll buy another one. It's a pain to sit on the floor and clean the whole house. can you imagine? ... do not recommend buying it....
2,A Mom,"I bought this with all kinds of expectations....the parts are not easy to attach. The attachments slideout easily when using and you have to start over.It is also very ""loud""...after I was frustrated with using it I put it away and then a few months later I tried to use it and forgot how things went together....and realized how un-effective the whole system was...I end up using it for the car and keep putting the nozzle back in every few minutes...as it continues to slide out. I would have never bought this had I known how it worked overall...."
2,Meh,"This book is pretty bad. All the questions can be found by entering them into google. Examples are pretty bad, some chapters are too long and drag on for what seems like a life time."
4,Good book,"This was a good, comprehensive book, just as one would expect. I was pleased with the way the principles were explained."
4,Great,"Had the CD and everything, this book has really helped out in class and I will probably keep it for reference material"
1,not for novice chem engineers,"okay first off, this book is NOT for 1st or second year students. the examples make sense(some of the time) until you get to the problems in the back of the book and then you wonder why you picked chemical engineering as a major in the first place because these problems really makes you feel sort of dumb. im taking the materials and energy balance class and in my school it's used to weed people out. let me say this again, if you are taking a materials and energy balance class and you need a text, do not get this one. i hear a lot of great things from the text basic principles and calculations in chem eng by D.M Himmelblau and J.B Riggs so get that one instead unless your teacher demands you get this book. truly a horrible book to start out a chem eng major."
1,"Classic Che Text Book, Horrible e-Book","This is and has been a classic book on the fundamentals of chemical engineering. My original hard copy's binding has fallen apart over the 30 years I've referenced this book. Having started the move to e-Books, I bought the Kindle version to read through my iPad app. The highlighting function of the app does not work on either my iPad or my Mac. The handlebar function used to highlight text is erratic, skipping whole sentences. It's pretty useless at this point. If I had known this beforehand, I would have purchased the updated hardback version instead. Would like to hear from Amazon if they have any recommendations on how to get this fixed."
1,Abolsutely Horrible,"I'm taking the class that goes along with this book at my school and I have to say this is the worst book I have ever seen. Yes it presents material and all that but it does so with very little explanation. If you don't understand it right away this book won't help at all, it won't explain any more, do any detailed examples, or help you with homework solutions. The only thing that could save this book is an answer solutions book because then you could learn from all of the homework problems. Without that, the homework is a complete mystery because most of it is never even taught in the chapter they just expect you to know it from somewhere else. In conclusion, DO NOT but this book unless you have no other option."
1,DONT BUY FROM THEM,So I never received the product that I ordered over a month ago... They never replied to my emails and never gave me back my money!!!! This is some really shady service
1,Item not securely delivered,I wasn't pleased with the packaging of the item or book I bought. A CD was in this item and the post office was not informed that this item is a fragile item. The CD got broken during transit and I'm not satisfied with the business transaction.Alfred Buba
1,this book blows,"this book is terrible, even for a science textbook! it is difficult to understand and is inconsistent with its notation. it is only made worse by its absence of a solutions guide, ambiguosly stated questions, and abundance of errata. a total waste of money for non chem-engineers.this book [inhales with force] and any class which requires its use is bound to [inhale with extreme force]. sorry."
2,"Decent, but by no means great.","The book itself was in good condition. However, the media that came with the book was damaged/unusable."
1,Big Zero!,"I give this book ZERO stars rating because it is an extraordinarily lousy textbook. The book has so many typos and mistakes it will make you mad and drive you crazy at the same time. Way to much bologna! The worst textbook I have ever seen or read for a class. Put the stink in chemical engineering. Author lacks insight in many different ways. One way the author lacked perspective was not providing any student's solutions manual. Not having a solutions manual makes it very difficult to learn principles and details for solving complex calculus and advanced algebraic problems because you either must copy from someone else or get the royal going over. Seriously, no joke, you would be better off using schaum's outlines to help than this book. FIVE Thumbs Down."
5,Carmen Met Opera,"Best performance I have seen. Sets, costumes, and of course the familar music. Elina Garanca gives a very sensuous performance as Carmen"
3,Good price but hard for installation.,"The price for that item is good, but the back side should be more longer for make the installation more easy."
2,F-Pin coax connector,"Poor quality, loose on wall plate, and I had to go to home depot to buy a better quality one. It's cheap but not worth the money, I ended up paying double."
5,Does the job,This is a good coax module for a keystone modular system. Has worked well without any apparent shortcomings. Easy to install.
2,Started out Good but the ending was disappointing,"This very short novel came with many fine praises, i.e. ""best thing since _Lord of the Rings_"". Instead I would described it as a short, cute fantasy about two wizards who go on a adventure and fight an evil wizard. The problem I had is that the world the story is set in is never really more than a string of small towns and villages. Then comes the deus ex-machina who pops up in the second to last chapter and the whole story wraps up very abruptly and unsatisfying. The version I read had some ink illustrations and can be read from ages 8 and upwards."
4,"Fun, thrilling read!","As a kid my favorite things to read were the Johnny Dixon books by John Bellairs. I am pleased to be finally be able to read this book, as well. Prospero and Bacon are great as a team, and the book has lots of startling surprises, along with a very mysterious villain. It was a great read, and wasn't so drawn out that made it a bore - Bellairs manages to wrap it up all in good time. Another masterpiece from Bellairs! I feel look going back and reading some of those old Dixon novels now..."
5,Surpassed my Expectations,"The Face in the Frost is, quite simply, incredible. The writing is truly captivating, making you smile or even chuckle out loud at one point, and at the next leave you looking over your shoulder for frightening things. The ending was not what I expected either, but it was totally innovative. This book is more than worth the read, and finding it should be a priority for anyone who loves fantasy."
2,Sounds bad,"I dont like it. I would rather pay for some more expensive strings that would sound better on my violin. My violin is not really good, but it used to make a better sound when I had other strings :("
4,"3M Littmann Select Stethoscope, Purple Tube, 28 inch, 2294","I am very pleased with this stethoscope. Nice quality, sound is very clear and it is also comfortable.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I wanted purple tubing and this is dark blue.Otherwise I am very happy with my purchase."
5,can hear clearly,"affordable does not hurt your wallet, good quality stet, can hear everything clearly plus ear piece is comfortable, stet is light weight"
5,Birthday gift for a medical professional,"This item was purchased as a birthday gift for a lady friend of mine. Littman is top-notch in the world of medical equipment and she was extremely happy with it. Also, the speed of the delivery was excellent."
5,Perfect for my wife.,"My wife is an R.N. and was really surprised that I got this for her for a Christmas present. She really loves it. Good sound, good fit, good fell. Very good quality. I would surely buy again."
5,EXCELENTE IDEAL PARA EL PREHOSPITALARIO,"FLEXIBLE Y SE PUEDE GUARDAR EN ESPACIO REDUCIDO, IDEAL PARA EL PREHOSPITALARIO"
2,Lost diaphragm,"I bought this stethoscope after loosing my nice steth in the radiology room, it was delivered pretty fast, but the issue I had was the diaphragm of the stethoscope was lost. Till now i was unable to get a replacement. I need to search internet inorder to find one. But if you have the diaphragm the stethoscope works well."
4,Lightweight for sure!,"This was a good purchase! Its very lightweighted, the sound is excellent, the low-frecuence sounds can be heard making preassure to the diaphragm. The only thing I didnt like much is the color! Cause I bought it ''purple'', and to me is more like a dark blue."
4,Cameron Hydraulic Data: Invaluable Designers Handbook,"I first became aware of Camerons Hydraulic Data book because all of the old-time lead design engineers had them on their desks. While these guys have a lot of books on their shelves, Camerons is in their hands. I borrowed one to verify calculations done in a spreadsheet and found it to be invaluable. I would recommend the book to anyone who does pipeline design. Headloss and fluid velocities based on flow rates through different pipe diameters are easily found. Thankfully, I found a copy here at Amazon for myself and don't have to borrow it any longer."
3,No Audio CD,"Haven't started reading the book yet, but I was dissappointed to find that the companion CD with native Korean speakers pronouncing Korean words was not included.However, I found a digital copy can be downloaded for free from [...]."
3,Somewhat Misleading Title,"If you are looking to learn the written Korean language, this might be just the book for you. If you are looking for a pronunciation guide, i.e., in conjunction with an audio language program and needing a back-up for poorly enunciated words, this is not for you. Also, do not let your 30 day return limit slip past you."
5,Solid Social Science,"A previous review called this book ""psuedo-scientific drivel.""In fact, this book is far from it. Well, as far from it as social science can get. In fact, is the most ""scientific"" of the user interface books I have read.The main point I took away from the book is that people interact with objects, especially interactive and media devices, as if they were people. They demonstrate that when user interfaces are designed to be polite and interact in a positive social manner, the person has a much more enjoyable and profitable interaction.Other books on the topic of user interface design are far less scientific, relying on generalizations and suppositions rather than constructing a study. Some use data from a usability evaluation, but these are often far from scientific.The authors construct hypotheses, usually based on the results of studies of interaction between humans, and see if the results of the results hold true for human-machine interaction.Usually, it does."
5,Forms the basis of my work as a Media Psychologist,"I come back to the theory at the center of this book, which is well supported by research across multiple media, over and over in much of my thinking and research as a media psychologist. This text is an excellent and essential base from which to start if you are exploring how the media affects our psychology and how psychology should inform media design and consumption patterns."
1,The whole world is a media equation????,"Reeves and Nass find that people use social conventions towards intelligent systems. Without further thinking they decide it is something new, something great. We are thinking of interactive systems as other social beings is their explanation. With some imagination you could come up with a number of other explanations, that equally well fit the data.I do not disagree with their findings, but I really disagree with their conclusions, especially the eagerness and determination with which they jump to them. However I notice their ideas seem pretty convincing, and here lies my real worry with this book. So if you decide to read it anyway keep asking yourself if the conclusions Reeves and Nass jump to are really as worthwhile as they make them appear."
2,What's the difference?,"So this company markets Samurai Rice Crackers and Oriental Rice Crackers. I was under the mistaken impression the Samurai version would be spicy. They're not. I got 8 packages. And none have been spicy. There may be a subtle hint of heat. But very subtle.I love rice crackers for whatever reason. But I could've bought plain rice crackers locally for less. This product is selling for close to 4 bucks a pound + shipping. The bins at Whole Foods, Publix and Fresh Market have it for close to the same price + no shipping. I also have purchased a better-tasting variety at Big Lots, 1 buck for about 12 oz.What I will say is that it appears these crackers are made for long-term storage. They're in a thick bag that I can't open with just my bare hands. They're really sealed up. If you want to still have rice crackers during a hurricane or if that big earthquake hits, this is a great buy."
3,It's OK,"Yeah, they are alright. Just your usual standard rice crackers. No peas, peanuts, wasabi, or sesame sticks. The quality is fine, but I was hoping for a little more variety. Costco seems to have stopped carrying their oriental mix here and I was looking for a replacement. Not with this product though."
4,Almost the perfect bag,I have been searching for the perfect bag for years and years. This bag has come closest to being that. It fits everything I need without being messenger bag big and is very good looking. I would like the strap to be a little longer but thats being picky. At first the softness of the structure bugged me but now I love that aspec of it. I am super pleased with this purchase and for the price. Amazing!
3,Fun,"We've always loved Guess Who, but once you've played it 10 or 20 times it gets pretty boring because you're just asking the same questions over and over again. So when they came out with the Littlest Pet Shop version, I thought it was perfect since my 6yr old loved Pet Shops and just to have different faces/questions to deal with. My daughter did love it, but it still got a bit boring after about 10 times. And since you can actually ask the animal questions (is it a dog?), it goes by very quickly. I'd say it's best for the younger kids."
2,Poor quality makes this fun game very frustrating,"There's no doubt this game is lots of fun and my 4 1/2 yr old and 6 yr old have lots of fun playing it. HOWEVER, the very poor construction of this toy is beyond frustrating. The initial assembly of the game took a great deal of time punching out all the flimsy cardboard cards and inserting them into the tiny plastic flip-card holders. Once you pop the holders into all their individual spots, they do nothing but continuously pop out. You can't flip two of them up or down without having at least one pop completely out or becoming askew enough that it won't flip properly. ""Mom help me put this back together"" is all I hear after every round and often during each round. Maybe the other versions of Guess Who are a little sturdier, I personally don't know, but I would definitely pass on this Littlest Pet Shop version. I could possibly accept this kind of quality from a $5 game, but not for the $14.99 I paid for it."
4,Great item.,I bought this as a gift. My granddaughter loves it. We did have a problem with the plastic holders breaking.
3,reconciliation,"The main theme of this story is that Elizabeth is trying to get a young boy called George and Georges bitter,angry father to reconcile.However Father doesnt seem too interested. Elizabeth is also working with George and others on a time capsule project."
5,Love this book!,I had a hard copy of this book as a little girl. I loved it then and it is still a sweet and thoughtfully rendered little ABC book.
5,Little girls of today delight in Grandmothers Doll,"This is a brief, but beautiful story about two little girls and their grandmother's doll, named Annabelle. The words are few...each of the dolls wardrobe represents a letter in the alphabet, starting with ""A"" Is for Annabelle. The illustrations are lovely enough to frame, but who could ever cut up such a wonderful book. Doll collectors ages 8 to 80 will love it!"
4,Lovely classic. Get this for a lucky girl,"Absolutely lovely alphabet book. I, an adult, find the illustrations gorgeous, but the reason I picked it up at the bookstore was my memories of adoring all things Tasha Tudor when I was a child. I found her illustrations magical, transporting, wonderful...the reason to buy this book is that you need an alphabet book kids (OK, girls) will love, to make the alphabet a thing of beauty and joy, and this text has the perfect rhythm and rhyme to draw in a preschooler/young elementary-schooler. You can always get the other Tasha Tudors out of the library (maybe buy A Time to Keep to help you respect and start your own traditions).The reason for 4 stars not 5 is, A is for Annabel is awfully old fashioned, full of words with which your young one might not be familiar. I find that a selling point but not everyone will."
5,a is for annabelle,"i purchased this for a 3 year old friend named anabelle,,she is learning her abc's.the pictures of the 2 sisters w/ their grandmother's doll were lovely.the 2 little girls who received this book love it!"
1,Krishnamurti's Teachings Are Clouded & Muddied,"Reading this book was pretty much a waste of time. Krishnamurti is a brilliant speaker & crystal-clear author, but in this collection of dialogues & writings, it seems that the publisher is intentionally trying to shroud simplicity in a guru's mist. The cover of the book, a black background with Krishnamurti's disembodied head floating in the middle, is fairly representational of this work. A thinker's simple thoughts are edited so that one gets a mysterious impression of what should be simply clear. Trying to make him a mystical guru ruins his work & message. This book was obviously intended to be targeted to those seeking ""generic Eastern wisdom."" Definately the worst Krishnamurti title I've ever read."
1,no stars would be more adequate,Not worth losing all the benefits and features of the TIVO for a few HD channels. I'm returning it and going back to my TIVO...I am now considering changing to cable since I am so upset about this whole issue. They charged me $299.00 for this piece of junk which is worthless to me. I would highly discourage anyone from getting the HD DVR reciever if you have owned the TIVO
1,Not worth your while.,"I switched from a DTV Tivo to this sad excuse for a piece of equipment. Like the other reviewers it continues to perform in the most sorry of states. Sound lapses, pixel issues and one they haven't mentioned. The thing will record a show just fine, however it will just continue to record on and on after the end of the show. Seems they can't get their machines to work with their guide reliably. The result? You lose some of your recorded shows due to lack of space on your HDD. Pretty annoying especially if you lose something like Heroes or Lost. Nothing but frustration at best is how I would describe it. I'm going to send it back and get a Tivo again. Did anyone mention the lousy program guide? Coming from a DTV Tivo to the DTV guide is horrendous. Navigation is so counter-intuitive and tedious that it is like unpaid labor. I look forward to removing this clunk from the living room."
1,WARNING! NO parts included.,"Under features it says ""Includes removable drawbar, pin and clip, hitch receiver cover and easy to follow instructions"" However, when the one I ordered arrived, in late June, 2010, just the bar arrived, not even wrapped in plastic as other reviewers said. There was a very deep gouge in the tube, too. I used the call me feature to talk with customer support, and explained the problem of no Included parts. The lady gave me return instructions, and started the process to send another hitch ""kit"" to me. A week later I got another hitch, same situation, not wrapped, no ""Included parts."" I refused to accept delivery from the shipper this time. Amazon got both hitches back, credited my account for both hitches, and case closed. The lady did say the product description would be updated to reflect the fact that no parts are included, but as of today, July 23, 2010 the description still says the parts are included. Don't believe it."
3,"Hitch great, bolts wrong size","Bolts should be 7/16 for 2003 Pontiac vibe. Came with one size larger. Not acceptable for product geared for the specific model. Cost 8$ and two day delay to get the correct bolts, not something u can get at homedepot. Hitch itself is great, after correct bolts acquired and car greased, most bolts went in easily, one was a challenge. But that's the rusty cars fault, not the hitch. Towed uhaul from dc to Wisconsin so it worked fine. I feel the bolt cost should be reimbursed..but it's not worth my time. I still may contact them out if principle."
1,"Not as described or pictured,","I saw other reviews stating that this hitch did not come with the draw bar, pin and cover. I thought it was maybe a fluke. Nope. No drawbar, pin or cover. Also this hitch did not include any instructions or mounting bolts. It is also sent sans box with complementary break-in scratches. Come on Amazon, update the description. BTW, it went back."
3,Hidden Hitch 60958,"Installation was pretty easy and it fits the vehicle (2005 Vibe GT) fine. My complaint is that one of the reasons I purchased this hitch over the others is that it says it comes with the removeable drawbar, pin and clip, and a hitch receiver cover, but it did not come with these items that it was supposed to. Amazon never responded to my inquiry. In fact, when it shipped it did not even come in a box! All I received was the hitch wrapped in shrink wrap and a packing slip label stuck on it. The directions and the other items it was supposed to include were not there!"
4,As close to hard bop as Wes gets,"This is not a great album, it is a good album with great guitar. Wes was just one of those guys with incredible talent and terrible taste in music. If you are a jazz purist this is a close as Wes gets. otherwise its that easy listening Verve stuff."
5,The Best Wes,"Years ago I had read in a jazz magazine how some top jazz guitarists were influenced by this album, so wanting to find out more about Wes I bought it. This was also my first Wes album(CD), and I was blown away!All I had heard before was some of his more ""pop styled""songs. I started buying a lot of him, but I still don't think there's a better one. Every song is great, the band is great, and I like the sound of his guitar better than a lot of his others. This is got to be in the top ten of all guitar records! In my opinion, an essential jazz recording."
3,Terrible sound,"This is a great, great album. You need to buy this album if you are interested in jazz guitar or guitar at all. But the sound on this CD is just plain awful. Spend the extra bucks and get the Hybrid SACD version or at least the 24 bit remastering, its worth it."
5,Don't let the price fool you,"This set has some of the best Mozart playing I've ever heard.Klara Wurtz's approach is very personal and very close to thewritten score. Far from the usual milky, pinky raised from the tea cup playing it shows why Mozart was Beethoven's first choice for a teacher. Even the first disc of the earliest sonatas would be worth the price of the whole set.I can't wait to hear more of her. She should be a household name."
3,Some Good Info IF you can get past extremely corny format!,"I really had to listen to both discs about 4 times to get over the irritating corny songs/delivery. There is some good info in there, but the songs drove me NUTS! I've purchased numerous language tapes/books, etc., and I think the most useful are:1. Berlitz Basic French (2831557194)...it's ALL in French (no english), but somehow it really sinks in.2. Learn in Your Car Series, Level 1 & 2-these more for basic vocab.I'm fluent in another language (spanish) and learn languages fairly quickly if that helps."
2,C'est trés horrible!,"I'd previously tried the Berlitz Rush Hour Italian CD's, which were excellent, so I thought I'd give the Berlitz Rush Hour French set a try. Compared with the Italian version, the French was truly awful. I found it difficult to understand the male narrator (he tends to mutter under his breath), which made it extremely difficult to pick up on the nuances of French pronunciation and speech. The female narrator's singing ability was on par with a shrieking opera diva. I've found the Living Language Complete Courses in French much more helpful and thorough."
1,idiotic,"I'm not a big fan, anyway, of the concept of learning in your car. The cacophonous and vapid jingles are more distracting than using a cell phone, or having someone yelling at you when you're trying to drive.If you like listening to lousy French sung to music worse than the worst TV commercial jingles, then this is the set for you. Otherwise, stay at home and use anything else besides this idiotic course."
1,"Too much, but not in a good way!","There is way too much going on here to really be able to successfully learn anything. For each topic there is a discussion/scenario followed by a song. The ""characters"" are too silly to be taken seriously and the music and singing are absolutely horrendous. I found myself actually distracted by the whole thing, which is not a good thing when driving. It grates on your nerves like a dentist drill and you find yourself unable to concentrate on anything. They lost me for good when the song ""colors of my life"" was half way through. It's difficult to learn with all this chatter, singing and music going on.I don't know who their target age group is since it's hopelessly childish, yet with adult themes (such as going to work and dating). Inappropriate for children, yet also not for adults. What were they thinking?"
1,just awful,"The folks at Berlitz must be getting desperate. Another listen-and-repeat songbook? One hour with ANY OTHER WORKBOOK will each you the French you need to ""get by"" on your trip to Paris. If you're a more serious student, just buy a more serious product. The botom line is: this product just doesn't work and it's not in the least charming. The reviewers who give five stars are Berlitz employees and most of the reviews you're reading are sales pitches.NOTE A DESTINATION DES PROFS: Ces livres sont du gaspillage total. Il faut les eviter à tout prix à risque de decevoir vos étudiants."
5,Math fun,"My son was introduced to this toy at a latch key (afterschool program). Unlike homework, this is fun and educational at the same time. He loves playing this game and is learning addition, subtraction and more. Great for kids Kinder and up. My son is 7."
4,Fun and educational,"We got this for our child who was needing extra help with adding. I bought this based on others' reviews, and I am so happy with this product. It's definitely improved her adding, and we have moved onto using it for subtraction, division and multiplication now that she's older. Still works well. We vary the rules a bit, depending how young the child is who is playing. Just goes to show the versatility of this game.It's a pretty durable, well-constructed game board. The lid slides on and off and the only pieces you need worry about are the two die.I'd recommend this. A good game for young ones in need of a little help. They can learn, have fun, and feel a sense of accomplishment when they win at the end."
5,Helpful with math,My son's teacher recommended this game to help my son with his math facts. Come to find out it's a great refresher for everyone in our house!!!
3,Not Much of a Challenge!,"I purchased this item for a first grader who is very interested in anything having to do with math. However, this item does not provide much challenge because of certain limitations. Specifically, the numbers only go to ten (10), therefore you are restricted if you multiply or if you add.I made it more challenging by placing numbers 11-20 on two of the rows."
4,This is for very basic skills,"This is a compact, easy to use game. It is not for anyone who already has basic math skills. I bought it to help my eleven year old son improve his and I when I received it I realized it was geared more for first time math students. I ended up giving it to my grandchildren who are 6 and 4. It is more age appropriate for them."
5,Great Album,"Great Album. Great price. If you are a Kaskade fan and don't own this album, you should. If only they would rerelease The Calm..."
1,Blah...,"I expected more, hearing all the hype about Kaskade. I recently stumbled upon his ""Late Night Alumni:Empty Streets"" music, and I bought the CD. Here was a CD with smooth character and an even smoother vocal artist working with him. I expected more of this awesomeness with his solo stuff.I expected too much from Kaskade.This album was an impulse buy in faith, that at least one @#$%ing track would be worth listening to. Alas, there is not even one. All of the tracks are flat, soul-less, and pedestrian. How this guy stays in the spotlight is anyone's guess. It sure has nothing to do with talent, that is for sure. How Late Night Alumni came from him is a mystery to me...I was a fool to buy on impulse, so in the future, I'll stick to Rob Dougan and Tiesto for my trance needs. Kaskade sucks."
1,This is the biggest waste of money,"My employer bought this book, because she is wanting a grant to expand her practice. After reading most of the first 100 pages, I got so annoyed. The first 100 pages are all stories about how much this book has helped other people (isn't that the same scheme already used to get you to buy the book? Why do we now need it in writing?) All of the information can be found off of web search engines by searching for grants in your state. The other grants in the book are so specialized such as grants for certain things in certain states or cities. The book includes a grant for asian elephants. Please tell me how many ordinary people out there need a grant like this one. My suggestion is not to buy this book. If I was you I would skip the book and use a search engine OR go to cfda.gov its the website for the government book he admits to copying from."
5,VERY HONEST AND INTERESTING,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. MILT PAPPAS IS BRUTELY HONEST AND VERY REALISTIC. THIS BOOK HELD MY INTEREST FROM PAGE 1 TO THE FINISH. HE COVERS HIS PRIVATE LIFE, CAREER, TEAMMATES, AND MANAGERS. HIS EXTRA FLINGS AND AFFAIRS ARE VERY CANDID AND DONE IN GOOD TASTE. HIS LIFE WAS VERY STORMY OFF THE FIELD. HIS DETAILED RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FIRST WIFE IS VERY SAD AND VOLATILE. HE HAD MANY HARDSHIPS, SOME SELF MADE. HE IS HUMAN AND HE DOES A GREAT JOB WITH THIS MUST READ BOOK. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,"Milt, did we need to hear about every start?","Milt Pappas, a largely forgotten player, has written a fascinating account of how a baseball career can affect a young family and a deadly account of nearly every game he appeared in from 1957-1973. Unless you are anxious to relive the frustrations of the early sixties Oriole clubs or get some vicarioius kick out of how a talent was often minimized by management, then only a few chapters will be of interest.This book could also lead to disillusion for the juvenile reader, as it is clear that management and playing personnel are not often pulling together, and that marriage vows are discarded for convenience and the thrill of the chase. Readers will also learn how neglect and boredom can lead to alcoholism and family tragedy. The author would have benefitted from a strong editor and greater self-control."
5,Uranus Described in Minute Detail,"Gorgeous gorgeous photos in this book, but it is not for kids or anyone daunted by lengthy scientific discussion presented in nine-point type. If you can get past the depth of the subject matter, this is a highly detailed look at both the process by which Uranus was discovered and the physical features of Uranus as captured by the Voyager probe.Definitely not for everybody. But just as definitely fascinating for those who are interested in the outer planets of our solar system."
3,"I fell in love, but it couldn't last","This is the first and only ""dustbuster""-type cordless vac I have ever used. I bought it a year and a half ago after much online research, and was TOTALLY pleased with its performance for all the reasons the reviewers here have listed. What a product!And then, suddenly, it couldn't run for more than a minute, then 30 seconds, and finally it couldn't hold a charge at all. Let's hope that two-year warranty works as promised!"
3,OK but switch problems,"Generally worked well, until the on/off switch didn't work any longer and the machine could not be recharged. I called customer service (800-211-9607) and they said it's been a problem on some of the vacuums and to return it for free repair if purchased within 2 years. Very helpful, but annoying problem. The vacuum is also a bit on the heavy side for a handheld one."
5,Best one around,This particular brand and model is very hard to find when I was shopping for one a year ago. They sold out quick due to the incredible performance. I owned it for nearly a year now. I have 2 toddlers and it's very handy at dinner table after the meals. (if you know what I mean) Clean it often to keep up the performance. I highly recommend it.
4,Best battery of any cordless,This unit has a real battery - sealed lead/acid type. This means it can be left on charge without affecting the battery lifetime. I would like a little larger battery though for more vacuum time. A tumble down a carpeted stairway did introduce a hairline crack in the inlet area of the unit but doesn't affect performance. Attachments are very useful.
1,No power,"Don't buy cordless! It just does not have enought power to pickup all the dirts. Brought many poor vacuums like Dirt Devil, it was too noise and pickup is very poor."
3,gothic dress from chicstar,"i received the dress, it was a nice dress for the price $49.99. sized a little small for a size large. i will say that it was cut for a tall thin person, so if you have some curves it doesn't sit right. working with the seller was easy, however, dealing with sending the dress back for a return was a little hard since your dealing with customs forms for china. i wouldn't have ordered the dress if i would of known that."
2,Fluval Parts,The Fluval part ordered works perfectly! I received it in only a few days. If I need any additional parts for my Fluval I will most definately purchase from this vendor. The price was great!
5,how i love it!!!,"avenue q is so wrong in every way that you can't help but sing along with it, and now that there's a karaoke version, i'm the star! :-P the tracks are obviously synthesized but the quality rocks and sounds very much like the original cast recording. they've even recorded the sound effects and underscoring for the script in betweeen verses so you can perform the entire song without having to skip over dialogue. the only problem is that amazon doesn't carry this for some reason, so i went to another site to find it but i guarentee it is the same item. [...]enjoy!!!"
5,"Brilliant, timely","Sesame Street meets ""The Graduate"" meets Jon Stewart. Avenue Q deserves the awards it has won--it is a brilliant, hilarious,sophisticated, insightful romp that is wise yet cunningly self-deprecating. It is, however, not for those who can't get past the spot on use of XXX language in service of one of the best--and most timely-- comedic masterpieces to hit Broadway in years."
3,Lumpy,"The headrest is rather lumpy and not what I had expected when I read ""memory foam"". I thought it would be a piece of memory foam. The cover is removable for washing, and that's when I saw the mangled mass of foam squashed and twisted and placed in a netting. It is a little big to set between the back of your neck and the car headrest.Overall, it is usable and does give some comfort, but I've had better ones."
1,Awkward and uncomfortable,It is lumpy and does not mold to your back. Very uncomfortable and does not serve as the support I was looking for in my car.
3,JENSEN TV-621 Amplified Tv Antenna,"It is a so so antenna, don't expect much of a great performance or boost to your weak signals. In a good signal area it performs well but in a weak signal area you'll be disappointed. The plus side is that it doesn't consume any electricity."
1,Waste of - admittedly not much - money!,This item confirms that the bitterness of poor quality is remembered long after the sweetness of low price has faded from memory! Tried on two digital TVs ... the performance absolutely sucks. It isn't amplified as is advertised and in my area a plain set of old rabbit ears with a UHF loop does a much better job. Fool me once ...
5,Five Discs,I found this on another website selling the same product. I know the first three discs sell for about $15-$20.. So I'd say this is a great deal.Disc 1:The New AtlantisDisc 2:Riddles in StoneDisc 3:Eye of the PhoenixDisc 4:Freemason Symbols RevealedDisc 5:Capital SecretsProphets of the New World Order
3,Disappointing,"Listed as ""microplush"" but is simply nothing but thinner fleece. If you are looking for a plush type blanket, look elsewhere. Was disappointed with the quality."
5,Githead,"Mr. Newman walks on water. This and ""Not to"" are brilliant, as was most of Wire's work. On to the future. Experience his latest band Githead. Transcendant.Headgit"
5,"Mayfair 134EC-000 Designer Series Ivy Molded Wood Toilet Seat with Easy Clean Hinges, White, Elongated","Mayfair 134EC-000 Designer Series Ivy Molded Wood Toilet Seat with Easy Clean Hinges, White, ElongatedREPLACED ONE I BOUGHT A FEW YEARS AGO.... LIKE THE STYLE AND FITS WELL.SUPER EASY TO CHANGE OUT IF THE NEED ARISES."
1,A big mistake,"the truth is that they are very beautiful, but it is also true that buying them has been a big mistake, all around them appears small spots that looks like ink and one of them came with a small cut that has been getting larger as the time pass. Unfortunately I bought them in Amazon and brought them to Venezuela, it was here that I saw them and now I can do nothing. For me this negotiation has been terrible"
1,NASTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Ok.I have had wasabi peas in the past.. These were BEYOND nasty. I will never purchase this product EVER again..I do not recomend this product to anyone.
3,An anthropologist's struggle to overcome his bias,"Heilman provides a fascinating glimpse of the inside world of the modern American Jewish anthropologist stuggling to overcome his bias. Like all ""middle of the road"" adherents of a belief system he feels uncomfortable in the company of more sure and more complete believers. Several errors of fact mar the book and it gives an outsider's superficial view of an extremely complex and and highly organised society."
3,the block switch broke... the card stopped working :S,"it was a good card... just one day its block switch broke, don't know the reason, don't care for one. I tried to fix it, trashed it afterwards.At least it came with a nice SDHC-to-USB thingy, which I am using with my other cheaper cards."
3,"UltraII is class 2, sometimes 4","It is hard to tell if the Sandisk UltraIIs are class 2 or class 4 devices. But they are listed for the same speed. Their pictures of the card says class 2, but their picture of the same card in its packaging says class 4. However, whether I got real sandisk or not, they seem to work good. They don't seem to care about others copying their products:-([....]I used to buy Sandisk exclusively, I have now started buying Kingston and surprised that some are made in Japan."
1,Not what was ordered...,"The picture and written review for this product indicated it was a 4GB class 4 memory card, but received a 4GB class 2 memory card. Contacted seller who then advised me that Amazon made the mistake by posting wrong product information. This rating is not a reflection on the product. Suggest inquiry before purchasing to make sure description is what you're getting."
2,SanDisk memory card,It was the wrong memory card for our camera. I returned it without any difficulty at all. Thank you very much.
2,plug problem,"i bought this a year ago for my handycam, rarely use it and just when i plug it in my computer and tried to pull it out, the USB plug left on my Mac. it seems to be glued to the body. can anyone suggest if it's OK to glue it back together and have it working properly? thanks!"
4,Works great!,"Sandisk has never let me down, and this purchase continues that standard. Excellent product!"
2,wrong item,this item should come with reader but i think they sent the wrong one which makes me unhappy
2,Slow on action setting,"First of all it didn't come with a reader. When I purchased this card it was pictured with a reader. I had a chance to put it good use this past weekend. The card was slower that my regular sd card. When I took action shots the camera would be busy for 2-3 seconds before I could take another shot. It's not the canon camera either, because I took that card out and put my old one in. It worked just fine. I don't know if it's the brand or if this is a rip off, but this card is horrible."
3,Card works perfectly; card reader was flaky,"Although the SD card itself works as expected, the card reader itself was flaky from the beginning -- sometimes wouldn't connect, sometimes would drop the connection in the middle of a download.It was definitely the card reader, since downloading from the camera or downloading from my new card reader both work perfectly."
3,SanDisk Ultra II SDHC 4GB SD Memory Card (SDSDRH-004G-A11),"Got my memory card more quickly than expected, but it could not be read by my card readers and/or computer. I'm still trying to figure out what the problem is. My camera records and displays photos properly with the card installed. But, my computer and two different readers, which read my Ultra II 2GB card easily, cause my computer to hang up when I try to read my Ultra II 4GB card. Will advise when figured out (or not).Charles"
5,Good Value,"I got this for my Panasonic DMC-TZ3 camera. There are so many choices but this was the best value in the SDHC, and it comes with a reader. Recommended."
4,fast and easy - not much more to say,This is a pretty straight-forward product ... I use it for my camera - and it has enough room for thousands of pictures. Read-Write times have been good.I didn't end up needing the USB adapter ... as my camera has one already.
5,4GB SanDisk Ultra II SDHC Memory Card,"This is product is very convenient, very fast and perfect for my digital camera. Great product and seller!"
5,"Great service, great product!",This item arrived so quickly. It was a simple transaction for a great product! Thanks!
4,SD memory card,"I received my two cards in great shape from the seller three weeks ago, but I just received my new Canon SX210 today. I have try taking pictures in all the different modes on the camera, plus HD video. So far the camera and the memory seem to be performing quite well, but you must remember that one day does not give an acurate rating of either. I have given four stars so far, but that may either go up or down in number after I have had more time to assess both the camera and the memory cards."
3,Card's Great - Reader Stinks,"No issues with the card, but the reader took a dive on us. I'm back to connecting the camera directly to the PC."
5,Fantastic speed and capacity for the price,"Bottom line, the card gets the job done. I gave this (and other camera accessories) to my girlfriend for her birthday, and this card was the highlight of the gift. She is now able to take photos faster because of the reduced time it takes for the camera to save the photo data to the disc--it's actually MUCH faster (she had a 1 gig card of unknown speed before). While my girlfriend rarely goes a day without moving her pictures from her camera to her computer, the card is able to hold as many photos as she can take. Gone are the days of having to delete photos off her card because it was full. 4GB is more than enough for anyone who doesn't need a ridiculously unreasonable amount of memory (such as for sports shooting) and I recommend this card for it's low price and fast speed. Great work, SanDisk."
2,SDHC 4GB SD Card,I can not rate this product because it does not operate in my camera. My camera does not accept this size card. My mistake in ordering it.
4,Can't read it on some machines,"My Pocket PC, and home computer can not read this card. I now find that some of my devices can only read cards up to 2GB. I have to use the card reader that came with it to download files to/from the computer. Which is okay, just not as convenient."
2,Disappointed that I have to buy extra cable for PC to read card,"We purchased this card to go with a basic point and shoot camera that we purchased at the same time from Amazon. The camera and card are great with one exception. My home PC will not read the card. When I contacted SanDisk Technical Support, they told me that this card was typically used by professional photographers and with high end cameras. I was disappointed that it was listed a good/compatible item with the point and shoot camera I purchased. Instead of just popping the card into the computer, I now have to hook the entire camera up to the computer to view/download photos."
5,lo maximo,this camera is the best and highly recommend amazon comptrado the staff totally serious when products despthis camera is the best and highly recommend amazon comptrado the staff totally serious when products despachardachard
2,Silverton Guitar,I bought this guitar from Amazon and I didn't like it at allSeems very cheap to meThe finish wasn't right and it just has a cheap look over allNow to be fair it is only 152.00 but even at that I don't feel it is a good valueI would say spend a little more and get a lot more...
5,kids love it,My boys love making little baby cakes in this pan. The pan releases the cakes beautifully! I am very pleased with this pan!
5,Clint Black,I have a been a Clint Black fan for 16 years and I was so excited to be able to find this CD on Amazon as you can no longer find it in stores. It is his first big CD and of course he has gone on to be one of the best in Country music.
5,When country music was still traditional,1989 was one of the best times for country music and with great artists popping out of the dust you get great ones like Clint Black. This is a very strong album for a first time artist Killin Time is a true classic to own. You'll love Nobody's Home and Killin Time and many others and Clint Black does something that many artists don't usually do he wrote all of the songs on the album that is remarkable. This was when country music was little more in a quieter shell and not all of this pop sound was trying to get into it.
2,Misleading description designed to get your $$$,"The description leads you to believe that there are two Detective Wong movies, when in fact the one starring Bela Lugosi is another Mr. Wong who is a criminal. Sound quality is poor on all videos,even considering the available technology when these movies were filmed. Save your money and buy a burger."
4,enjoyed,look at movie & enjoyed.i have always love old classic movies for years.i really don't have to much to say about this movie expect order and enjoyed.
1,Encyclopedia of Positive Questions,"Disappointing. The word ""encyclopedia"" seems to imply a large body of information clearly describing the subject. This book misses the mark in every possible way. Lots of filler repetition, lots of empty space on the last 70 pages."
2,Not quite what I expected,"I was expecting that these were reading glasses but they are actually bifocals where the top part of the glass is ""regular"" glass and the reading part is just a small bi-focal part towards the bottom."
5,quilt and embellish in one step,"It took a little longer to get here than I expected, but it arrived in very good condition. I was very happy with my order."
2,Secular Screed on the Bible,"This book possesses echoes too much textual criticism common to humanist critics of Christianity. The tone and views of many contributors is sharply cynical over the inspiration of the Bible and the truth of Christianity in general. Some reference material is informative and okay, but this book should be left to egghead intellectuals, humanists and unitarians."
5,"Doable, Beautiful, and Delicious Dishes","Not only is the cookbook photographed wonderfully, the contents are substantive and the reader learns from Portale. I've made 10 dishes from this cookbook, all of them crowd-pleasers. I would have made more by now, but I kept forgetting to look at this book. I especially love his seafood recipes. This chef doesn't get much national attention, but he's right up there with Boulud and Waters."
3,Artistry...if you have time to spare,"The flavor principles introduced are noteworthy, however, they can be achieved in a much less labor intensive manner. For inspiration, fantastic, but there are multiple, often complex elements to each dish. Unless you have hours to prepare each stock, sauce, and vinaigrette, you might want to look elsewhere. A note: this book is aesthetically triumphant and would make a fabulous gift."
3,The Spirit of Mex Design,Good book - unfortunately it is mostly pictures and I had expected it to have more text and this is why I did not rate it higher - it arrived in Great condition
5,Mexicolor,"Just received the book and it lives up to it's title! An excellent example showing the love and application of color so typical for the region. Interiors, accessories, art and much more. If you enjoy a riot of color combinations you should enjoy this book."
4,Beautiful book,"I had seen this book in a bookstore and love it. I purchased a used book and the quality of the book as advertised by the vendor was very, very good. If you love the colors and textures of Mexico, this book is for you."
4,A lot of ideas for my new home,"I was (and still am) searching for books, information and pictures of mexican architecture and color. This book was helpful for me, and also brought back great memories of my two trips to Mexico. This country is amazingly beautiful and rich in cultural heritage, and in my search for rustic/mexican ideas that I can adapt to the design of my new hacienda-type home, I found that the book satisfied me with all the beautiful pictures portraing the real Mexico. A must have for mexican citizens living outside the country, and Mexico freaks (like me) as well."
5,Absolutely dazzling!,"This book is jam packed with stunning photos. The colors are rich and vibrant. We are treated to textiles, handicrafts, architecture, landscapes and interiors all fairly jumping off the page in beautiful living color. Eye candy of the first order!"
3,some good references for semi - advanced users,"I actually bought this book because of the 1 star comments saying this book spent too much time on Servers and Databases. Well Hey, those subjects are for the big boys who actually make 6 figures a year.I am an advanced programmer, but fairly new to UltraDev - i create web applications where the Html/JSP/ASP side is just half of the picture and this book has helped in linking the two.BUT, i did find that the author(s) tried to stuff too much into the book to make it to 300 pages - i already know how to do the basic stuff in Dream Weaver - bring on the advanced stuff. Half of it did seem to be copied from the Utradev tutorial help!"
1,THE WORST BOOK EVER!,Just look at the review by jsonterre1... I agree with him 100%This is the worst money ever spent on a book. I am currently going through exercises that often don't seem to work. Very frustrating when you're actually expecting to learn from the book you have purchased. This book is more complicated than UltraDev itself. I don't recommend this book to anyone.
5,A superb addition to a wonderful movie.......,"I, too, had to watch the credits roll at the end of You've Got Mail. Nillson's ""The Lord Must Be in New York City"" was skillfully inserted in the soundtrack at a dramatic moment that added to the performances of Hanks and Ryan, much the same way that the audience was seduced by nostalgic music additions to Sleepless in Seattle. Curiously, the soundtrack CD offers Sinead O'Connor's version.We hope that Harry enjoys the well deserved exposure to his work that You've Got Mail brings."
1,Nice Printing But Terrible Paper Handling,"After only a few weeks of use, paper started jamming, in this printer.This problem only got worse with time.I am currently on my second unit (Canon sends you a used/refurbished unit as a replacement) and still having the same problem. Paper randomly jams in the transport and the printer has to be turned upside down and opened, in the back, to try and get the torn paper out.Sometimes it just tears the edges of the paper, like Jaws.This printer prints text and graphics well but otherwise it's been a real lemon. The paper handling on this unit really stinks! I had a Canon IP series printer before and it worked well for almost two years.The Ip5200 has been a major bust! Consumer Reports was dead wrong about this unit or did I just get two lemons in a row?"
2,IP5200 is A Dog,"We use about 12 IP5000 printers in our business - wonderful quality, good speed, etc. These have been upgrades from previous Canon and Epson - long ago HP printers. So We have some experience. The new IP5200 is a dog.Only if you are printing only photographs should you use this color printer. Only on high quality settings - such as glossy - does it give a satisfactory image. For photos fine - but for other color printing - look elsewhere. We returned the IP5200 today. Don;t know what to do now! We loved Canon."
3,Question about refilling ink tanks with chips.,"I like this iP5200 for my next Canon printer, but hesitate, because I print a lot, and re-fill the tanks; and have since the beginning. Before I purchase, I must make sure I can refill. One ink refill site says to keep answering the on-screen questions until it accepts the cartridge. If it is just more trouble, I can deal with that; but if it will not let the cartridge be used, I will have to stay with a model that still uses the BCI-6 tanks. Help!!"
3,Canon iP5200 Photo Printer,"The printer is well made and functions well. Speed is good for both text and photos, even at high quality. My main complaint is that photos, especially poitraits, have a distinct reddish tint. It's difficult to remove the proper amount of cyan since the photos look perfect on the monitor. I've waisted way to much photo paper and still can't duplicate the image on the monitor. If anyone has an answer to this problem let me know please.clicari@pwhome.com"
5,Ian at his Best indeed,I love this album for many reasons but the first and foremost is that it gives the listener a taste of the raw and unpolished talent of this man as well as the very polished music he produced.Ian Dury was unique in both voice and talent and anyone who studies or simply enjoys learning about music should listen to this album. It will broaden your horizons.
3,Good music but over-produced...,"The Proclaimers are one of our favorite duos. We eagerly awaited the release of this album, and went to see them on the release tour. They performed a number of songs from this release and we bought the CD immediately. We anticipated that the songs would sound differently live than on the album, but could not help but be a bit disappointed. The songs are well written and the album isn't bad, just over-produced. The vocals and harmonies that are the Reid's best asset are almost overwhelmed by the instrumentals laid down over the top. Previous recordings had an edge - anger, angst, passion, call it what you will - that is lacking in this most recent effort. The passion and edge were there in their live performance but, unlike previous efforts, failed to make the translation to CD."
5,I have reviewed this product already please check your records,I have review this product already. I did give it a good rating review. I did let you know that it did arrive at my home quickly...Thanks Sharon Johnson
5,My cross pen refill,The refill is perfect for my pen because it is the right refill for it and the price is reasonable.
2,Great product - Wrong Size,"These flowers were of great quality, but the size I ordered was not delivered. Through Amazon I purchased 4 oz of flowers. What arrived was a glass jar with .64 oz of flowers. Definitely a disappointment!"
3,Good Collection of Hits,"This is a good collection of hits from one of the biggest stars of the early 80s. Some of the songs are not in their album-length version, which was disappointing. Contrary to one of the ""expert"" reviews, I actually like the individual albums themselves better than the greatest hits package. Some of Mr. Springfield's songs that were not released for mainstream consumption were not only his best work but some of the best in all of the 80s. Nonetheless, if you are only looking for the songs to which you already know the words, here they are."
3,ROCK & ROLL DOCTOR,"RICK SPRINGFIELD-GREATEST HITS: Aussie poster boy/soap throb (""Calling Dr. Noah Drake to treat a case of heartbreak!"") Rick Springfield rocked a little harder than your average David Cassidy or Donny Osmond, and unlike those teen idols, wrote most of his own material and played his own guitar. Eons after his early banjo-punctuated 70s breakthrough hit SPEAK TO THE SKY, Rick's WORKING CLASS DOG album spawned a trio of expertly crafted pop gems, notably the lust-for-your-best-friend's-babe anthem JESSIE'S GIRL and the Sammy Hagar-penned I'VE DONE EVERTHING FOR YOU. Later singles mostly sounded like sideways versions of his WCD stuff, culminating with his last great gasp LOVE SOMEBODY, from the soundtrack to his dead-on-arrival movie vehicle HARD TO HOLD; that celluloid disaster effectively torpedoed his musical AND Hollywood career simultaneously. The even dozen tracks gathered here are just enough of a pretty good thing while it lasted.RATING: THREE SWOONS"
5,Rick's greatest are great on this cd,"Really is a greatest hits - you'll smile, reminisce, sing, jump, dance, rock and be so glad you bought this - Love Somebody, Human Touch, Jessies Girl (of course) - can't go wrong with ANY song on this cd. Songs have energy -if you've seen Rick in concert, you;ll revisit here - if you haven't, you'll want to. Great selection of songs - all the songs you want to hear."
5,Great for big sisters (and brothers) feeling jealous of baby,"Darcy expresses the same emotions my daughter has been feeling since her newly adopted 12 month old brother arrived home. When my daughter seems overcome with feelings of jealously and displacement, we read this book and it calms her down by giving her a chance to talk freely about ""Darcy's"" feelings. As long as I can find copies of this book, I will be giving it to every 3-6 year old big sibling I know who has a new baby in the house."
4,da bomb,"What a wonderful combination of brazilian and jazz music -- sensual, moody, eclectic and cohesive."
3,"Review of a printing ""Los Piratas de Mompracem""","I ordered this book because of nostalgia. I first read the book in my teens around 1952, in my birth place, Havana, Cuba (before Castro physically and spiritually destroyed it). I never forgot the adventures of the swashbuckling pirate Sandokan and his love for Mariana. Reading it again after more than fifty years brought me good memories.I have to note though, that about forty pages in the middle of the book were bound upside down and backwards so that after page 128, I had to go to page 161, turn the book upside down and continue reading. No big deal. I still enjoyed the reading."
4,good young reading book,This book falls right in line with the Laura Ingalls Wilder style and type of book. Any young person who enjoys reading fiction would benefit learning about our country's history and still be entertained.
2,Pales in comparison,"Honestly, this book is a compilation of some of Laura's best stories and not a very well written one at that. It was a rip off of the high points of the Laura Ingalls Wilder series.I found the two main characters entirely unlikable. They were bland and boring. We were told to like the characters and sympathize with the characters, but I found myself almost amused when the grasshoppers attacked their crops.The writing completely dull. Every storyline had been done before. There was absolutely no originality. The only reason it is getting two stars is because she has Laura for a mother. It is no wonder that her books are not nearly as popular as her mother's."
4,Informative,A great read for people interested int he history of marionettes and other puppets. Very informative and interesting. Would recomend for pupet fans.
3,Isaiah's Emmanuel,"good information why the name Immanuel and how it was a sign of a coming human called Immanuel giving cause for the hebrew people to believe more, other than the miracles.However the name disappears after some hokey pokey in Matthew making Isaiah's prophesying just about nil."
2,still waiting for toast......,"We loved almost everything about this toaster. It was handsome and industrial-strength-looking. But the toast took WAY too long. We even compared timing with another toaster and it took more than TWICE as long!Too bad, because it was one of the few toasters I've tried that seemed to toast evenly on both sides. Also, the slots were too narrow for some fatter things like bagels, but on the plus side, they were longer, so I could toast larger pieces of bread without cutting them down. So if you have a lot of time in the morning and are very patient this is a good toaster for you. I returned mine."
2,A year later and I need a new toaster,"When I first got this toaster, I was thrilled. Finally, a toaster that will toast perfectly and looks attractive. At the beginning all was fine. It did take a bit longer to toast the bread but the resulting toast was great.That said, having to select 2 or 4 slice prior to pushing down the lever(s) seemed a waste of time but if you didn't do it, the toaster would not start. Now a year later, the unit is sparking and the levers are not going down. I am off to buy another toaster. You can bet it will not be a Russell Hobbs."
5,a toaster that knows it is an appliance!,"I bought this toaster for my family after buying one toaster a year for the last 5 years. At first, I was wondering if I could ever justify the cost - but now, after only 3 months use, I can honestly say - this machine knows its job and reliably works every time. There are settings for frozen bread, cancel settings, and of course, the bun warmer rack. I use them all - and I get the best of results. No more burnt or lightly tanned bread. It's crisp on the outside, moist on the inside. Superb. This toaster is well worth the money."
1,Russell Hobbs toaster,I purchased this toaster for my sons family for Christmas. It worked for 3wks and than the right side froze up and hasn't worked since. I am going to return it.
4,"Great songs, confusing track listing",I think the cd is pretty good. It has some harder to find Dorsey stuff but at the same time the track listing on the cd itself is a maze to try and figure out. Rather than listing the song and whom lended their vocals it has the vocalists on a seprate charte with song numbers near their names for the songs that featured them. It gets confusing when there is more than one vocalist and the order isn't even in a very distinguishable way that can be quickly looked at. The song quality is decent.
5,Wonderful resource for Space: 1889,"If you like role playing in the Victorian Era, this is a resource that you won't want to pass on.There are all sorts of nifty things, adventures, floorplans, characters, cross over ideas, and background flavor."
2,How To Conduct Business 101,"Is THIS what rich people know and want to keep secret? I doubt it, unless the message was to just go into business and stay there. This book was nothing but common-sense business strategies that a 3-year-old could tell you.<sigh>...more fireplace fodder...<sigh>You get much better info by reading Thomas Stanley's books. He actually INTERVIEWS rich people and gets their secrets.Here's one that more useful than this whole book: buy a laundromat or car wash. They're low-key businesses that get used by a lot of people, and those quarters really add up!Here's another: own a junk yard. Those ""wreck"" vehicles make more money for you as separate PARTS than the whole vehicle was ever worth or ever cost to purchase a a hulk.Move along...nuttin' to see here. Go see Thomas Stanley's works for useful info. You'll thank me later."
5,What Rich People Know and Desparately Want to Keep a Secret,This is one of the best book ever written. It is better than Rich Dad Poor Dad by a mile. The author is obviously a genius in his field and everyone who is interested in learning the non nonsense practical approach to business must have this book by their side.
5,amazing,my daghter was so happy when i gave this to her for christmas and the 2 hamsters like it a lot
2,systemax,SYSTEMAX MAKES A VERY GOOD COMPUTER BUT SERVICE IS VERY POOR. A LOT OF THE SALES STAFF KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS AT ALL. SYSTEMAX MUST HAVE HIRED ANYBODY WHO SHOWED UP FOR THE JOB.SUPPORT SERVICE COST $9 A CALL. I CAN SEE NOW WHY THE COMPANY HAS SUCH A LOW RATING IN SERVICE. IF THEY CAN CLEAN UP THIER ACT MAY THEY CAN SELL COMPUTERS UNDER THIER OWN NAME A LOT BETTER.
2,What Constitutes a Day-by-Day Calendar?,"I received this as a Christmas gift, and frankly, I'm disappointed. I love the Onion, and look forward to reading it online every Wednesday morning. While I enjoy reading the articles, I thought it was a cheap copout to use up multiple days of the calendar on the same article. In my opinion, the point of these calendars is to have something new to laugh about each day. Who is going to stop mid-sentence on Monday and then pick up the second installment Tuesday, only to stop, mid-sentence once again, until reaching the final conclusion Thursday or Friday? Doesn't the Onion have enough captions, in the news, infographics, statshots, news in brief, etc. to fill up a calendar? There are plenty of these in the calendar, but in the next two weeks, three articles take up nine pages combined. I don't think I'll buy this next year, unless the format changes."
1,Do not buy this,"This ""best of"" is simply a rehashing of previous calendars. There is no reason for photos of Bill Clinton in a 2004 calendar. If you have seen or owned previous calendars, you already have all the humor. In additon, the stand came unglued from the calendar, rendering it useless after 2 weeks."
1,never again,"dear everybody, this is one of the worst books i have ever read. a word of advice DO NOT READ THE DIVINE WIND. sorry garry disher, this was a flop. Even though it won some awards. it was not a good book. your a good wordsmith, but not a good story writter."
1,The not so Divine Wind,"What kind of a name is MITSY? And by the way what kind of a name is DISHER? We have been forced to study the Divine Wind in english and we hope this love story (if you can call it that) isn't a re-enactment of Disher's childhood. The characters in this book are undeveloped, the romance is cold and boring, the scene is as well set as a rubics cube. How can this book be compared to Romeo and Juliet? Overall leave romance to the experts."
2,Is an item that i would not recomend is really complicated to use i wouldn't buy it better vga to vga follks don't spend ur mone,"The item i got is just what they said but i couldn't make work is a cable that u wouldn't want to buy, don't spend ur money in this folks i would rather get a vga to vga less conplications"
2,dissapointing at best,"I have to disagree with my friend Dan, the series is not getting better, but progressively worst after each release. Not every song on this compilation is bad, but please... Hilary Duff?? The Vines?? or one of the weakest BNL tracks ever??The disc could have been improved because there was much more great music that would be worth it, i have every Now! disc from 1-7 and i don't find myself in a rush to get either of the last 2, just a fact that they've been getting worst."
1,broke,"So stoked to get this after finally moving all my music onto my ZEN and throwing scratched CDs out the window.I love having a Creative Zen, people always ask what it is.""It's a huge media player that plays music, videos, and photos. Basically like an ipod touch, but not as cool, bigger, and w/o WiFi.""But w/ a car charger, it's all you need. 2 months in, I pulled the plug out of the jack in the car, and the whole thing camp apart. I have no problem splicing wires back together, but this thing is done. It needs to be sodered. So it's a bust, but only cost be $6.So, I'm ordering another one, because it's cheap and it works! hahaIt's one of those things that you think will become obsolete and you won't be able to find a car charger some day...damn."
3,"It's cheap, but it works.","I've had this for about a year now. We're not talking terribly high-quality here, you do get what you pay for. It fits and it charges, and that's groovy.The downside is that the charging end frequently just COMES APART. Threads must be too loose. Meaning you've got two to three little bits of metal paraphenalia floating around in the car.(The workaround is that you just check it every couple of days and tighten it all up. Annoying, but again, it's so cheap...)"
5,Great Product!!!,"Product is everything that it is advertized to be! It's light, rugged and protects the memory cards extremely well...I'm very pleased with it and will buy a couple more for my other cameras!"
3,no frills case . . .,"This aluminum case has rubber inserts molded to accept CF cards, and should provide good general protection. The fit is tight, so the cards won't fall out, and there are provisions that allow for easy removal. The case appears to be dirt, dust, and moisture resistant, but is definitely not waterproof. It should withstand normal wear and tear, but probably won't stand up well to hard direct impact. There is play in the hinge, which means that the two faces of the case can slide, and not always seat properly. The covers are held closed by a metal clip, and it is a little hard to pry open the case with just one hand, and quickly access the cards.This case does an adequate job, but is rather plain looking, has a kind of a `cheapie' feel. Hakuba and Pelican, make cases that are more stylish."
2,Not that great,Fit and finish of the case is questionable. When closed the case is loose and has a lot of slop. Cards are seem secure in the molded rubber. Feels cheap and would not recommend.
3,Interesting but intense,"This book was an interesting book and, undoubtedly, an important book from the professional stand-point. However, from the layman's stand-point, I thought it was a little too intense. There were sections that I had to go back and reread several times in order to understand what the authors were trying to say. I think this was because I am a layman with only General Psych 101 as a background. I can not, however, speak as to its rating for a professional."
5,Anxiety DO,Good for everyone who takes mental illnes seriously and wants to be professional with their patient's who have this disorder.
4,A beat era classic,"This is the Hollies' second album, never released in the U.S. It features a generous number of original songs (credited to the anonymous ""L. Ransford""), some of which (""Time for Love,"" ""Please Don't Feel Too Bad"" and ""Set Me Free"") hold up well as early examples of the Hollies' eclectic and energetic approach to pop rock. Some of the covers shine as well, the medley of ""Nitty Gritty/Something's Got a Hold on Me"" oozing a bit of that sweaty club feel, and ""What Kind of Boy"" the sound of a single-that-never-was. There's also Graham Nash's first solo vocal, on the otherwise forgettable ""To You, My Love."" The whole project sounds like it took no more than a couple of days to record, but that's part of the charm."
4,the hollies review,"buy this! this is a great cd, mainly due to the original content even I who ain't much of a dancer at all can go nuts to this stuff! I really give it an 11 out of 12!! Is there such a thing as too much talent?? nah! the other one to buy is the abbey road three cd collection! this would be the hits one! to me their best stuff will always be from 63-66! look thru any window and I'm alive being the top of their creativity! only song missing in this is jennifer eccles, the last shot at innocence!"
5,Outstanding summary of the lighter side of the cold war era,"Of Fried's three books on the cold war era, this focused on pagentry rather than just McCarthyism (although the two are inextricably tied). ""The Russians..."" provided humorous and interesting anecdotes about the impact of the cold war on everyday americans in ways I could not have imagined. I highly recommend reading it."
2,Don't read this if you are a cold war novice.,"Although this book has educational merit, and certainly a place in the study of the cold war, it is not a good book for people with little or no knowledge of the cold war. The book, although dry, is well written and well researched. Drawing upon primary sources it does a satisfactory job of presenting the stated thesis. However, the author really reaches at points (especially in the final chapters) to connect the subject he is discussing to the cold war. Some of the subjects discussed, for example the Civil War Centennial Celebration, took place during the cold war, but were not nessesarily connected to the cold war. If you are looking to build a foundational knowledge about cold war facts and history I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,Where Are the Photographs?,"A skimpy book (only 159 pages of text), with rather repetitive material, this cries out for photographs of the pageantry it describes. But there's only one photo (on the cover). Where are the colorful parades, the patriotic pageants, the anti-Communist publications of that era?"
2,Do not judge by its cover,"The people making this cd understood many would by because of the cd case and title of the songs, but the stuff is so bad it is not worth commenting. The growling evil character sound makes this very childish."
2,"NOT non-stick, but otherwise a good pan","I bought this pan because it was non-stick, plus it had the air cushion between the layer of steel. I bake my usual brownies and cookies and they all stuck to the pan. It stuck more than my glass pyrex casserole pans. It was not easy to get it off, I had to scrape it off and it took time and a bit of muscle. Definitely not non-stick. The air cusion works from preventing the bottom of the cookies from overbrowning, which is not exactly a great idea since the top of the cookie become significantly more brown than the bottom of the cookie, which sometimes is moist and not quite holding the cookie together.On the up side, this pan doesn't warp if you are baking at 350 degrees of below.I am returning this item, I wanted non-stick and this definitel was not."
4,Great for beginners,"Most of the things covered in this book are already known to photographers that have worked in the field, but for photographers starting in shooting models, this guide gives them a good start in the field.Even though the book is titled 'A Step-by-Step Guide for Photographers', the information in here is even more valuable for models. Info on height classifications, measurements, posing, etc. I'd say all new models, and those that want to be models, this is a 'must have' book."
5,Worth every cent...,To the point and simple to understand.By far one of the best photography books I have purchased as yet....
4,great book for advanced amateurs and pro photographers,"I think this book focuses over a wide range of problems you could find in your photographic sessions. It's not only about posing and lighting, but also about your goals and your models' ones. It explains, in a very concise and clear way, how to take the photos that your models need to use.As a professional photographer, I think the quality of my works improved, and my approach changed a lot after reading this book from cover to cover."
4,Best for beginners,"Model portfolio photography tends to be a seductive pursuit that attracts photographers who either lack the necessary experience, or shouldn't be doing it in the first place. Portfolios are properly shot by working fashion or product illustration photographers who understand the challenges.Even so, it's difficult to resist the allure of photographing an attractive subject, and everyone has to start somewhere. I recommend starting with this book. It truly is a step-by-step guide that leads you through everything you need to know to help a model create his or her book.If you're a veteran pro, you might find some ideas here, but will hardly need the education. Beginners can do themselves -- and their subjects -- a service by reading this book thoroughly before attempting their first portfolio."
4,Great!,"My brother went to Italy in the early 90's and I asked him to bring me back some italian music and what he brought back was a tape of gianna nanninni. All I remember is her voice. Rough but yet good.Many years later, I became curious about her again since it's been so long I haven't heard some of her music. So I picked this one up without really knowing what's the deal.All I can say is that it's good...very good!Tight production...great rhythms...some electronic beats thrown in for good measure and that voice....unique!If you're looking for a good record that pop fans and experimental fans can enjoy equally then this is it!"
1,EXCUSE ME?,the only dike dolls around here are bratz thankyouverymuch my scene will forever be better

5,"Us, Bratz slaves. Yeah right","LISTEN TO YOU, YOU ARE THE MY SCENE DOLS WORSHIPPER. YOU ARE ALSO A BIG FAT JERK. MY SCENE DOLLS SUCK. YOUR JUST JEALOUS THAT BRATZ DOLLS ARE BETTER THEN MY SCENE DOLLS. MY SCENE DOLLS SUCK AND SO DO YOU. KINSEY, YOU ARE A BIG JERK WHO SHOULD GO AWAY AND LEAVE BRATZ ALONE.THEY ARE BETTER THEN MY SCENE DOLLS WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. BRATZ RULE AND MY SCENE DRULE."
1,Yazmin usually rocks but......,"I don't like this doll, which is too bad because Yazmin is my favorite Bratz character. Winter Wonderland Yazmin is the coolest though..But...I just don't know about THIS doll...I just...don't like her..."
1,shakes head in disbelief,"Partridge I agree with you completey!! I remember what an impact barbie had on me at that age, and barbie even dresses a little bit to much on the edge, but atleast her make up isn't so over done, and she doesn't have a humongous additude problem!"
1,UGLY,Hello first i want to say this is my apeinon.I bought this toy today and i was first glad.then i opened the box and i brushed her hair MISTAKE!!!Her hair falled of and not a litlle bit almost EVERYTHINGAnd then i thought well the clothes hase tobe nice then i saw the most UGLYIST boots and skirt and almost all her clothes were awfull. I wanted to throw it away but i thought no i give it to my cousin. BUT SHE DOESNT WANTED THE DOLL she said give it to a junky but this ois my storie.P.S FIANNA aND NEVRA ARE tHE BEST!!!
5,Yasmin DOESN'T suck!!!!!! Especially not night out Yasmin!,Why would anyone say Yasmin SUCKS! I think Yasmin is the best doll in the bratz pack. Fianna is very nice but Yasmin (inmy opinion) is best. (...)How would you like it if I suddenly started talking a load of trash about Fianna? I like Yasmin night out best. (...)
3,The idea of a review is to...,"The idea of a review is to give consumers information on whether this toy was a good buy, was fun, or had issues such as shoddy workmanship, or pieces too small to be real.As a mother buying these toys, these reviews are important to me, so please leave the little kid stuff to another website, so I don't have to read 29 stupid comments before I find a serious review by a real user of the product. Thank you, ladies."
2,Bratz OverView,"I feel, in my opinion, that these dolls are very inapropriet for the recommended age of these dolls. 6-10 is the recommended age, do you think a 6 yr old should be exposed to such poorly dressed figures? I think these toys are out, setting bad examples to the kids across the country, dressed in barely ANY clothing... Some kids feel they need to be that perfect figure that their ""Doll"" has, which is just WRONG... I'm personally not a fan of the ""Barbie"" but these dolls just put the icing on the cake. That is my opinion, please do not take it offensively. Thanks :)"
1,yeah i made that up,"to imitate all the obsessed mindless people (namely that B word, Kiss up to bratz) to try to say that my scene suckz because they ""copied"" their godz."
1,I HATE BRATZ,"THIS THING IS THE UGLIEST TOY I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS, AND LOOK AT WHAT IT IS WEARING THOSE ARE THE UGLIEST CLOTHES . WELL IF YOU EVEN WANT TOO CALL THEM CLOTHES AND LOOK AT IT'S HEAD IT LOOKS LIKE A BOBBLE HEAD AND IT IS WAY TO BIG FOR HER UGLY BODY. AND HER UGLY LIPS AND HER UGLY EYES AND HER UGLY PURSE AND HER UGLY HAT AND HER UGLY EARRINGS AND HER UGLY NAME AND HER UGLY FEET HER UGLY BRUSH AND HER UGLY SUNGLASSES AND HER UGLY HAIR. I LOVE BARBIE SHE IS THE MOST LOVELY DOLL. I COULD SAY 1,000 GREAT THINGS ABOUT HER. BUT I COULD SAY 1,000 HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT BRATZ. THERE IS NOTHING, NOTHING I LIKE ABOUT BRATZ. OH AND BY THE WAY WHAT KIND OF NAME IS BRATZ??????"
1,these can't be aerosoles,loved the look of these shoes but every time I wear these I have sore toes. The foot slides forward because the straps don't hold the foot in place.
1,Too mature for me,"I love Aerosoles, but the problem with this particular style is that it looked better on-line. When it arrived it was too mature for me, meaning it would be something my mother in her 50's would wear. Since I got it for a really good price, I just ended up giving it away to my co-worker."
2,Long and narrow!,"The style is wonderful, but the shoes were so uncomfortable I had to return them. The slope of the foot is much steeper than it looks in the picture, and your toes are jammed into an amazingly narrow point in the front with all of your weight on them. Also, the strap was very loose. Maybe for someone with a long and very, very thin foot."
4,A well rounded movie,"This movie was quite entertaining. The special effects were good, considering it being 35 years old. The dying mothra was impressive and fought Godzilla til its death. I would have to rank this movie in the top 10 of all of the Godzilla movies made."
3,Think about it.,"The sine waves will pull equal. If you decide to make you own, keep in mind there is nothing to protect one of the generators if it shuts off. If one shuts down or runs out of gas, you will be feeding the coil without the motor turning hence it will heat up. The OEM Honda parallel kit has this back feed protection as well as balancing circuitry."
3,Make your own at your peril,"We're dealing with alternating current here. Ask yourself how the ""make-it-yourself"" advice is going to synchronize those sine waves. Not saying I recommend this particular product mind you. The Honda kit is cheaper and it's made by Honda."
4,Good job!,"This is a children's book, but I'm 25 and I still enjoyed it. I wish that there had been a little bit more about King Harold and Duke William, but the story is still a gripping one, set in that all-important year of 1066."
4,Only So-So,"Yeah, so I read ""Mara Daughter of the Nile"" and LOVED it. Naturally I ran to the library to find all of the Eloise McGraw books possible. I stumbled upon this book. ""Mara"" was a lot ot live up to and this novel fell sort. Yeah, it was beleivable and the charactors were good. The history part was good too. But where is the suspense, the intrigue? Juliana found here nitch in life while embodering the tapestry, but when it was over, then what was she to do. Here problems weren't really solvered. Her life was not yet stable. Truley the end was unsatasfactory. And now we come to one of the biggest problems it just seemed more juevenile then the previous books. So, I'm going to try the next McGraw novel in hopes that it lives up to my expectations. Will the Golden Goblet be Satisfactory? One never knows."
2,Not worth it.,My six year old daughter had a lot of trouble figuring this game out. It kept getting stuck and we had to re-boot the computer. Not worth the money.
3,Small,"It's a nice travel hot pot, but I was looking for something bigger. The pictures make it look bigger than it really is, beware of that. It holds less than a liter of water."
3,"Not the best, but not the worst","If you're looking for an accurate example of Jefferson Airplane's downfall, here is the perfect one. Since Marty Balin left after VOLUNTEERS, Grace Slick and Paul Kantner became group leaders, creating 2 somewhat forgettable albums. LONG JOHN SILVER is better than BARK, with the best songs being ""Twilight Double Leader"", ""Aerie (Gang of Eagles)"", and ""Trial By Fire"". But Grace sounds strained, which is a downer. Altogether, not too shabby, but check out VOLUNTEERS instead."
3,the end of a era.,"The band at this point was fading away and people were going their own ways. In some respects this cd matches that one as others have pointed out , this one is like each member coming up with a few songs and then that's it. The interaction is not so strong but at least at this point they had realized that the end of hippiedom had already happened. People were out working supporting their families the commune age was done. The dream of world peace was lost in a drugged out haze of indifference and this record reflects this realization completely. That's why they changed their name to jefferson starship a great rock and roll band if there ever was one for sure. And one song on here 'twilight double leader' is that group already. This is their most average release for sure musically. But a average ja cd is way above alot of other bands music for sure."
3,cigar box,"No one has mentioned how the original album cover opened into a cigar box full of fine looking weed. I guess it would be hard to do this with a cd jewel case. Great cover, disjointed album, otherwise."
2,Walking the plank,"Jefferson Airplane / Long John Silver: ""Milk Train"" is the best song on this album. It is a wonderful Papa John Creach song with lyrics added to it. This album is fuzzy and loud, which is fine, but what kills the album is its ridiculously PREACHY and ignorant lyrics. Honestly, by the time you hear half of the last track (Eat Starch Mom) you want to throw the disc out a window. Two stars (not even Papa John could save this one)."
2,"Bland, tired effort from a band in need of a break","There isn't much to recommend this, the Airplane's final fist-shake before it switched into adult-contemporary hit-making mode. Grace is especially grouchy, complaining about ""stupid Christians"" (Easter?) and natural food (Eat Starch Mom).The sole highlight is ""Alexander the Medium"", in which Kantner attempts to scale the stoner heights he achieved in BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE, and nearly succeeds. Grace joins in for some of her most righteous wailing on disc. Sadly, it all sort of fizzles out at the end, with a completely inappropriate fade-out.This CD version confirms that the album was shabbily mixed, much like its predecessor BARK. Vocals tend to be buried, and everything sounds flat and congested, with limited bass.Get this only if you must have absolutely everything by the Airplane."
3,Long John Silver--Holland remaster (2000),This is definately not the Airplane album one would use to convince naysayers of the group's validity. Though the liner notes incorrectly state that Marty Balin was still in the group--he wasn't. Neither was drummer Spencer Dryden (replaced by Joey Covington). It's perhaps the worst album to bear the Airplane name. The remastering is adequate but the choice of an alternate cover is baffling to say the least. Though not bad it's for completists only.
2,An Embarrassment!!,"Jefferson Airplane was one of the hottest groups of the 1960s and definitely the best band from the San Francisco area. They would have done their legacy a huge favor and thrown this album in the trash rather than releasing it. I gave it two stars for the Jorma Kaukonen tune ""Trial by Fire."" Your money would be well spent on anything by JA from the 1966 to 1970 period and pretend that this album never existed. This was written by perhaps the Airplane's biggest fan so this is not an idle slam."
3,"One final flight for a tired, but angry Airplane.","While the Airplane was splintering, at least they decided to go out with a bang. This is more of a desperate""Im going down in flames"" then a farewell album. Regardless of the state of mind and affairs that were going on within the band, this is one angry Airplane. So have a toke, do another shot and enjoy this somewhat sloppy, loud kiss goodbye to the flower age. ""Aerie(Gang of Eagles)"", ""Long John Sliver"", ""Trial By Fire"" ""Milk Train"", and ""Eat Starch Mom"" are the best thingies here. Each track is one barrage of fury after another, like they knew this was going to be their last statement and they were going to show you that putting an end to their eight year flight over the countries wasn't a picnic, it wasn't pretty, and they really did hate to see it end. I did too."
4,Long John Silver and Protest Music,"If you respect protest music as a genre, this is a must-hear record. There are songs about the Pope, a censored song about Jesus, tales of pirates and warfare. The music has the clang of battle and the dust of history. It may not be the best played Airplane album, but to hear how Grace Slick fills up the spaces in ""Aerie (Gang of Eagles)"" shows you why she's one of the seven wonders of the rock and roll world. There's also a lot of nice aphorisms, and Kantner's poetry is as good as he gets. Overlooked."
1,Way overrated...,"For the price, I was expecting something a lot sturdier. Nope, it's thin and flimsy. I guess it cooks frozen fries as well as a plain baking sheet, but I certainly don't see a huge difference. Definitely no better than one of those perforated pizza pans that sell for about $5."
4,It Really Works,"I am not suppose to eat fried foods. I love french fries. This product does a GREAT job baking french fries. It is the closest thing to real grease fried french fries. It works really great on the sweet potato fries also. It is so much better than a ""ccokie sheet""."
5,The Best!,"I have been a fan of A Cappella music ever since I was in A Cappella choir in high school (no, I won't say how long ago that was!) I came across this CD and once I heard it, I was hooked!!! You will be too; their voices are great and the songs also, especially - Good Old A Cappella, and Eli's Coming (which is haunting)...."
4,Title of CD is Truth in Labeling,"A nice collection of 'melodic' hi-nrg hard house trance. One of the few dance CD that doesn't try to pretend to be something it's not :-)It would've been nice if they spent more than2 minutes creating the CD cover but otherwise, no complaints."
5,eloquent self-discovery,"a poignant, eloquent look inside one of the more important subjects you will ever study, but only rarely understand - yourself.Alan Watts paints a poetic rendition of ways to interpret relationships between self-understanding and understanding the world around you.This material is essential to healing the planet."
5,Brilliant and Inspiring,"The Book is in my top 5 most inspiring books, I recommend this book to almost everyone I meet."
1,DON'T BE BRAIN-WASHED,"Initially, I enjoyed The Book. When you read it, life seems ok. No worries, no cares. No consequences for your actions. No justice. Watts wants you to believe that you are god. You are not God. Did you create yourself? Watts would say that there is no Self. But if there are no individuals, there is no justice. I don't want to be associated with very evil people. Watts thinks everyone is an extension of one eternal being. Read carefully. It sounds good. Too good. Don't trust Watts without examining the situation for yourself."
5,Alan Watts was enlightened!,"The late Alan Watts was enlightened. He wrote several books, and all of them are jewels. Among them are THE WAY OF ZEN, THE TWO HANDS OF GOD, BEYOND THEOLOGY and IN MY OWN WAY. Buy them all.If you seek spiritual wisdom, if you are interested in the age-old questions: Who am I? Why am I here? What is the purpose of life? Is there a God? Is there a life hereafter? What am I supposed to do with my life? Then you could do no better than to read Alan Watts. He has no peer, in the English language.Joseph Pierreauthor of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS"
5,Truly THE BOOK,"If I were given the choice of only one book out of every known book published, I would choose The Book, hands down. Read it -- absorb it --- embrace it -- then accept it -- that which you have known all along, but only now can acknowledge."
5,Seminal Classic,"I really can't add very much to what has already been said in the above reviews. This stands as a culmination of Alan's exceptional translation of ancient wisdom traditions, the book you read if you've read nothing else of his. Give it to your child when he has a fairly adequate grasp of the English language, and then let him learn about all the illusions it harbours. Scrap every self-help book you may have bought in the past. This is the one. I almost died laughing at its beautiful truthful simplicity towards the end of The Book. You can almost hear Alan chuckling along with you. One to read again and again."
2,"Yes, Moralizing Condescention","I love Alan Watts. I thought ""The Way of Zen"" was the best book on Zen, Buddhism, Taoism and Hinduism that I ever read. ""The Book"", however, was a major letdown. Although he has a few nice points and metaphors this book is basically a rant against a stereotyped 50's America.He goes on interminably about how everything is known only in terms of its opposite (what it is not), that everything is relative then states there is only one ""IT"" in the Universe, the Ego is the root of unhappiness and this is THE way to look at things.What if I'm happy with being a self-centered ...? Basically, ""The Book"" is a thinly veiled hindu/buddhist derived metaphysics and ethics without the religion.I also agree with the other ""Moralizing Condescention"" reviewer who said this philosophy is very burgeois and one should read Dr. Watts descriptions of Buddhism (like ""the way of zen"") rather than his preaching of buddhism"
2,"Alan Watts, ""The Norman Vincemt Peale of Zen""","I first read Alan Watts's books 30 years ago.He got me interested in Eastern thought, but after I gained more knowledge I realized he was quite glib and shallow. His argument in this book is that the ego personality is an illusion.To progress we must get rid of it and realize our true self, which is at one with the universe. So far so good. However, Watts oversimplifies the task.He seems to think that by reading this book one will get a flash and see the truth and all will be rosy.He doesn't explore hard reality of ditching the ego. He doesn't mention 'the dark night of the soul' true mystics usually experience. Genuine self transformation requires dealing with the subconscious mind, but this vital aspect is not investigated by Watts. For example, most people have psychological complexes which tie up psychic energy. Until these complexes are resolved, development is thwarted. Watts does not explore this important issue."
3,"Disapointed with the chain, impressed with the pendant...","The gold chain that came with this is the tiniest chain I have ever seen. It broke within 30 seconds of my husband clasping it around my neck. Obviously poor quality, so plan to pay for an upgraded chain with this pendant. It was really mis-matched since the pendant was of better quality and more significant in size and seemed to dwarf the chain.The pendant itself was bigger than I expected and the stones reflect light very well. It is a beautiful blue topaz pendant. I would recommend the pendant only. The price was a bit high considering the poor quality of the chain."
4,Very good quality and color,I was very impressed with the quality of the stones and setting. I would have given this product a full star rating if the chain was stronger and longer.
5,Fabulous,"This CD is simply joyful in sound. The artist Mory Kante became famous releasing albums with electric instruments but grew up with very traditional music. This album is somewhat of a return to his roots, using almost all acoustic instruments for a more traditional sound. Granted, you have to be expecting an acoustic sound. The vocal choruses are gorgeous, too, but again, this is a different vocal style than is common in the US, so you have to be expecting and be open to a different sound. That being said, I thing this album is awesome. The rhythmic tapestries weaved by the instruments and voices are enticing. I'm actually involved in playing hand drums, and I enjoy playing along with some of the tracks on this CD. Overall, this is a well-composed, well-recorded collection of music, well worth a try if you're open to some high quality, acoustic, African music."
2,No improvement over a passive antenna,"I purchased this antenna as a replacement for my old, cheap, passive antenna, expecting some improvement in reception due to the amplification... but instead I found no improvement whatsoever in either channel clarity or number of channels received. It claims to be ""Perfect for HDTV,"" but I don't see how this antenna would give you a good enough signal for that, when it's not even good enough for my regular old TV."
4,Available for Free,This historic book is available for free from Project Gutenberg http://www.gutenberg.org. Search for Geometry. This book is one of a few books available. This is the complete Open Court text. It is available both as a pdf file and a TeX file.
4,tapping human resorces in central asia,Its difficult to tap the exact talent in a thickly populated country with disturbed economy and democracy.Knowledge based industry cannot achive a break until unless manupulation is stopped in higher grades.Priority must be given to the basic human/mankind nature instead of mechanical approaches.There is a greater necessity of real/civilised kings instead of lion/uncivilised kings.
4,Good overall expansion,Fun was added with the extra floor . Made the game a little longer and the little chips added extra fun to screw up you fellow players . Fun for new gamers and quick enough for short attention spans
5,Beautiful and Creative,"I checked this book out from the library, and am here to buy it. The designs in this book are absolutely lovely, and I can't wait to get started on new projects. It is a little confusing for a new cross stitcher to figure out exactly how big a piece of material is needed, and some of the stitches are more complicated than you might be used to. Also, since the main pattern spans several pages, you have to either copy and piece them together, or be able to work across several pages. I would recommend this book for the intermediate to advanced person."
3,Somewhat disappointed.,"I was looking for several specific items/patterns but was really disappointed this book did not have any of them. I will still use the book when needed, but right now, it's on my shelf waiting for the right time."
2,Pretty disapointed,"These weights are definitely made for men (I hope that there aren't any women with ankles bigger than mine!!). I know that I am of slender build, but these weights wrap all the way around until the spiky Velcro attaches itself to the ""wet suit"" material. This makes the soft Velcro part useless. So unless you have ankles that are the size of a large horse I would look elsewhere. Although with them strapped up tight they do their job!"
4,nice comofy leg weights,"I was very pleased with this purchase, short an simple it will be, they have good stretch to even put both on one calf/ankle an swap legs or do one per leg. I enjoyed the comoft an mobility with weaght training after surgery on my knee."
4,"a bit of a ""uni-tasker""","The product arrived on time and was packaged nicely. The pan itself is pretty heavy duty, but the tiny heart removable plates are a bit flimsy. The bottom of each ""mold"" is slightly bigger than the removable plates that makes me second think about filling the molds with any runny batter. It would probably only be used to make cheesecake, tarts, or something with a more solid base. The pan has little nooks and cranny that would probably be a pain to clean if you didn't clean it properly the first time."
5,Cute paper doll set!,"Two cute and sturdy paper dolls, one is Sophie, the other is Michail. And darlingaccessories."
4,The best so far.,"The best short introduction to Lacan in English so far. It might have its simplifications but it is inevitable in a book of 200 pages which covers so huge a subject. As for May 21, 2006 one star review see his/her review of ""The Puppet and the Dwarf"" -- if you have read it, it will tell you more than you want to know."
1,Oversimplification is the name for the erroneousness,"Bruce Fink, though a practicisng lacanian psychoanalist, has outlined quite a an oversimplifed version of the Lacanian theoretical edifice. Not so surprisingly, oversimplified means erroneous for much of the time. Especially, when it comes to giving examples for what abstract theory holds, the author comes very close to misrepresentation. Take for example his definition of the Other as ""collection of all the words and expressions in a language"", his constantly naming of ""unconscious as foreign to the self"" and this ridiculous (fictious) example of Einstein remembering the words of his father he heard when he was in pre-language stage. It may be, i dont know, a not-a-bad book for a starter who is supposed to develep no furher interest (desire?) for Lacan and but certainly a misguiding for a demanding reader."
2,Agree with Nathan's mom,"I was going to buy this seat when I noticed the same problem that a previous reviewer noted. It was the Everwood pattern at Toys R Us. As noted, the buckle could slide back and forth to accomodate different positions. When the buckle is all the way forward, there is a metal piece exposed with a sharp hole cut out of it. It is the perfect size for a little one's fingers to get caught in. I did not buy this seat because of this. I will check other patterns to see if they have the same defect. The deluxe model in the store was okay (the fabric covered the hole) but we didn't want to spend an extra $20 for a cupholder and headrest, neither of which we would ever use. Thanks Monica for your review-we would have never thought to look for this!"
5,Great Car Seat,"My 16 month old daughter has been in this car seat since she outgrew her carrier at 5 months. The seat has held up well. You can remove the fabric portion of the seat if need be and wash it. It has a great safety rating for a car seat in it's price range. Unlike some of the other reviewers I didn't have any trouble with the strap adjustment knob in my small car. The seat is easy to install if you read the directions, and like the other reviewer I would suggest taking it inside to adjust the straps before you install it. I plan on using this seat until my daughter out-grows it, and buying another one if I have any other children."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"Do not waste your money on this carseat. The chest clip just snapped in half because of the cold weather after only 1 year and the chest clip is not replaceable. In fact, Evenflo refuses to replace the carseat. They aren't even trying to help. What idiotic chair would not be able to replace a simple chest clip. All other carseat companies can replace the chest clip but not this one. Be careful when purchasing this item."
2,Hate It!,I absolutely HATED this seat. The straps are such a pain and when you are trying to adjust them while its raining outside.. HORRIBLE!!!
5,WE LOVE THIS CAR SEAT!!!,"This car seat is TERRIFIC! We now own 3 and they all work great and are easy to use and install. They fit into smaller cars well, both rear and forward facing and the Tension Right knob used to tighten the straps should be standard on all car seats. This has been a snap to use, the straps don't twist around much,and securing even a wiggly toddler is not a problem. We have been using this seat since my son was an infant and he is now almost two. We have been through several car seats and I HIGHLY recommend this seat."
4,I Love this seat - only a few minor setbacks,"We bought this seat for my son when he out grew the baby carrier at 4 months!! (he was 20 lbs and 28"") He still had to be rear facing though till he was 1 year. This seat was awsome!! I really liked how you can adjust the straps from the side knob, its very easy to adjust the height of the straps too with out having to re-thread the entire process, and its a very comfortable seat as well. In addition to this Consumer Reports rated the seat safer than the more expensive Britax RoundaboutThere were only a few pitfalls with this seat. That was that its a bit heavier than some seats, the straps can get a bit tangled if your not carefull,and can be somewhat confusing to a 2 1/2 yr old just learning to get into his seat by himself. As with any seat there will always be a learning curve to it.I would buy this seat agian in a heart beat!! My son is now 3 1/2 and we plan on passing it on to our youger child."
2,NOT THAT GREAT.,"This carseat was to heavy, to big and just overall a hassle. It wouldnt even fit properly in the van we have. we then opted for a cheaper model (by about $40) and found it MUCH better then this cumbersome carseat."
2,I hate this thing!,"Shoulda bought the Britax...probably will still...The straps are the worst part on this thing. They are so hard to work with and the crank to loosen them about breaks your fingers off.Yes, Consumer Reports likes this for safety - but it's a nightmare to use!"
2,Just OK,"Ok for the price, but we also have a Britax roundabout, which is MUCH nicer and easier to use.The strap system is a little awkward and difficult to use on this car seat."
4,Love the car seat,"This car seat seems very comfortable and also very safe for my daughter, the only downside is it is very heavy, and you have to unscrew it to take off the padding to clean it."
3,Car Seat,"The car seat looks comfortable for the baby, and it's rated to be pretty safe, but the safety buckle is very hard to snap into place once the baby is in the seat. It can be frustrating."
4,Evenflo Triumph Convertible Car Seat,"Not a bad car seat for the price. We purchased it due to the reviews that Consumer Reports gave it. Very easy to install, but slightly difficult to buckle. Little one likes it much better than the infant car seat."
1,Hated the release lever!,"I am truly suprised that this chair has such high reviews, we just returned it and bought a Graco. First of all the shoulder harness has two overlapping belts which are a pain to adjust. Second, the release lever for the restraints is conviniently located on the side, but of course you have to wrestle with it and put your whole body weight on it for it to click and release the belts. Was mine a faulty one? I don't think so."
3,Interesting premise,"I thought the idea of having a book told entirely through a woman's journal entries, along with her husband's response to those entries, was unique and interesting. However, I didn't care very much for the characters, particularly their views and handling of children. These characters seemed to think that children are objects and not human beings, with some of their actions and thoughts being abusive. The characters also seemed to be a bit flat. This novel is certainly a different read from the typical book, so in spite of the characters I would still recommend this book to others if they were interested in reading a novel written in an unconventional format."
3,Wolfking,"I discovered ""Wolfking"" while browsing in 1992. A good take on post-Apocalyptic ideas with the addition of old Irish folklore. While the story was strong, the reading was almost a crawl. Ms. Wood gets a little ""over descriptive"" at times, almost making you say, ""Hurry and get to the good stuff."", which she does in sweet time. Those with patience will come away with a unique and fairly joyable read though."
3,Could've been better.,"I thought this was a pretty good book with a great idea. Unfortunately, the majority of the book was a rather tedious buildup to something that didn't require it. I think it was okay, but it could've been better."
2,Utterly disappointing,"If you have read Kevin Anderson's first X-files novels , you will be utterly disappointed by this trash!"
5,A fine addition to the X-Files archive of any X-Phile,"After reading Goblins, Whirlwind, and Ground Zero, Ruins provides an interesting change of pace. Instead of a supernatural attacker, or govt. accident, the novel returns to the EBE ideas and also introduces an animal--the Kulkukan--as the attacker of those who would do wrong.The action of three storylines (the military team, the mexican militia, and the UFO) converging the pyramid is well written by Kevin J. Anderson, and is very effective and exciting."
4,Pretty good read.,"If you're an X-Phile, like me, this is a pretty good read. Quick, exciting, and fun."
3,Who REALLY wrote the movie?,"WARNING: THE FOLLOWING REVIEW MAY SPOIL THE STORY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET READ IT!""Ruins"" is not only perhaps the best novel of fiction based on the hit series ""The X- Files"", it also bears a striking resemblance to the storyline of the movie, ""Fight The Future"".Think about it. In the book, a woman is abducted and in the end, Mulder finds her encased in a case surrounded by thick green liquid. He revives her and they escape. And as Mulder runs out of the place where the woman was trapped, he notices that it's a UFO which takes off and leaves. Scully, naturally, doesn't see this.The ending of this book is almost exactly the same as the ending of the movie. I talked with the author, Kevin J. Anderson, about the similarities between ""Ruins"" and ""Fight The Future"". And he even kinda agreed with me on it. Perhaps Mr. Anderson should have received a co-screenwriting credit for the film."
4,What a book!,This is your basic x-files book but with more suspence and a better story line than most of the other x-files.This is a real FBI case. The story line is intense and interesting Mulder and Scully venture into the wilderness of the yucatan jungle in search of a team of missing archaelogists that had gone missing. They find an electronic signal beaming up from the ground; the signal proves to be an important clue to the case.This is a book that anyone could read; it's a must have.
3,mulder??,"i agree that ""ruins"" is a good book - the descriptions of mayan culture are interesting - but one of the things that really annoys me is how 99% of what mulder says consists of stupid one-liners. also, there's something about scully in this book that isn't quite authentic. vladimir rubicon says ""uh"" too much.these are just little things, but they bother me. otherwise, this is a pretty good book and i recommend it to all x-philes."
4,it worth to be a movie!!,another frightening story for the xfiles.... some readers has said that the events was slow but i think that the author wanted the reader to discover the characters more and more deep.... and he have succeeded to make us sympathy with the characters and loose our breath with the horiboly events....a good novel that makes u live the atmosphere....it will keep you up all the night...so get ready to find the truth....
3,I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTIONS,"given in this book for constructing the flexagons. They are minimal at best. I have had this problem with origami books, too. So, I recommend a prospective buyer look at the book before buying to make sure he or she can understand the directions; what is the value of the book if you can't actually construct the flexagons and play with them?"
1,Strange Book,That book stinks. That is my Opinion. has nothing to do with the French Foreign Legion. I dumped it into the trash can already. Very disappointed.
5,Kaiser is a Bread Pan,My husband and I bake 16 to 24 loaves of bread at one time about 2 times a month using Kaiser Bakeware. The bread bakes up beautifully and does not stick (even without greasing the pan before use). Clean up is quick and easy. It is highly recommended to hand wash and let completely dry before storing away.
3,Takes off,"This album is the first of many good Jefferson airplane albums. The band has Signe Toly Anderson not Grace Slick. Overall, this album is rated three stars cuz most of the songs are just average. The best song on the album is probably Blues From An Airplane. This album is not bad, but I'd reccommend getting a collection of Jefferson Airplane first."
4,This is NOT a prequel to SPL,"Hate to break it to you guys but this movie is NOT a prequel to SPL. Donnie Yen's character name is different from SPL. In This movie his name is Ma Jun, Ma Kwan was the character in SPL.So yeah...not a prequel. The movie it's self is pretty cool though and even though the two movies have nothing to do with each other, it's worth checking out."
2,"I STILL DON'T LIKE IT - Donnie Yen is great; writing, direction here are all particularly bad",An Amazonian Robot sent this appeal for a review to mealthough I've already reviewed it. I didn't like it; it's a realcome-down from his Ip Man series. It's just a series of reallybloody bashings and little else . . . Save your yen.
2,"I'm a huge Donnie Yen fan, but...","I found this moving to be disappointing.The plot was weak, with a lot of posing and preening from Donnie, and the fighting.....forget martial arts, it was Donnie trying to do MMA in a movie.From arm locks, to leg locks, to suplexes, to elbows, to arms flailing and flailing and flailing. I half expected Donnie to do a Rick ""Nature Boy"" Flair figure four leg lock also.Whatever.Donnie showed a lot of passion in the film, but the story line never built it up to present a reason why he was so angry and why he comes across as a rogue cop.It seems like lately, all of Donnie's movies have him as a fighter, but not as a lead character even though he's sold as such.Beyond fighting, he's got a long way before he makes a movie where he convincingly comes across as the lead actor (minus big name supporting cast) where he can carry a film all by himself like Jet Li has done."
3,Great movie but cut,"Simply put this movie has some great action, and a good story.If you like modern day martial art action films this will not disappoint.The reason I did not give it four stars is that it is cut.Its only about 10 min. but if you watched the full version you'll notice.sadly dragon Dynasty does this from time to time, yet some of their movies come with both theenglish cut version and the uncut version with only the original language.Why these movies are cut I do not know."
4,AMERICA'S CRITIC,donnie yen is just awesome and i love the dragon dynasty collection! no more to say than get this movie it is entertaining!
4,Good value for money,"I bought the webcam aroung $25 after rebate (it took 2 months to process). For this amount of money I am perfectly satisfied with what I got. A nice webcam that gives crisp clear picture for web conferences. The settings available are not many, but enough for the average user. It does have some hard time at low light conditions but not that many to call it useless.Now I'm waiting for another rebate offer to buy one for my brother :)One last note though: I tried to make it work under linux with no success. I tried Fedora, Suse and Ubuntu with no luck. Maybe it was me who did something wrong. I didn't dig it too much."
1,Disappointing Quality,"I do video chats often, so I like to update and buy new webcams every two or three years. Even though according to the specifications this webcam is superior, its quality doesn't come close to my old Logitech QuickCam Zoom. I've played with its configurations but it made little difference.What's nice about Creative's webcams is that unlike Logitech's, you can download and install only the driver (that includes the advanced features like face tracking) without the applications and useless integration with Windows Explorer. But this advantage does not compensate for the poor quality.I use my webcam in the evenings, in a well lighted room. It is possible that in daylight it would perform better, but I believe that Creative should have done better.Now that I have higher appreciation to my old Logitech, I'll return this one to the store, and maybe buy a new Logitech when I see a good deal."
5,Great produce,This is my first webcam I've ever owned and I have no complaints with this product. I mainly use it for video messaging and it works out great. I have yet to have a problem with it and it provides high quality video and pictures. The software that comes with it also is very good.
3,Better than the base model,"I had a terrible time installing an entry level web cam from Logitech so I thought I would try Creative's alternative, but this middle level model not the cheapo. Of course its an outstanding improvement over the cheapest ones out there. This seems to be a product category that is fairly competitive so buyers get what they pay for, nor more and probably less.The software is way less intrusive and uses minor resources, which is great. It even has an automatic function that can change the zoom if I decide to stand up or walk around"
4,Good,I been using this camera for a month. I think picture quality is very good; both motion and still image. Amazon delivered me this product on time. I gave 4 star because of the size of the camera. Yes you can use both for desktop and notebook. But for notebook it is big and you cannot attach to your notebook just hang on it.
3,Not supported on Linux,"Don't buy this webcam if you ever intend to use with Linux. As of Nov, 2006, it won't work under Ubuntu 6.10. Works OK in Windows but the face tracking software is useless. As usual, don't use Creative's bundled software. It sucks. Installing the driver suffice."
1,Poor picture,The camera had a poor picture that lacked any sharpness. Installation was easy though. I may have just received a model that got damaged during transport.
5,Very good webcam!,"No hassle installation on My XP based System. Fast video thanks to USB 2.0, no lag time. Just make sure your PC has USB 2.0 to take full advantage of this webcam. Nowadays all PCs have USB 2.0. After mail in Rebates it's a very very good deal."
4,Good little Web Cam,"We bought two of these, one for us and another for our daughter in MT.They were easy to instll and use. They take great snap shots as well.Great little camera at a little price. I will be getting one for my son in Washington DC."
3,Great picture quality BUT,"This camera has great capabilities and great picture quality. It adjusts to all kinds of lighting without any problem. The software has features that you can't find anywhere else. It can watch the babysitter or the house and do all kinds of other good things. But it had a huge incompatibility with my system. It kept taking pictures for no reason every 1 to 2 seconds. It was filling the hard drive really quick. I contacted the manufacturer and at first, we concluded that we had a hardware problem. I exchanged the camera but unfortunately I had the same problem with the second one. I ended up sending it back and buying a Logitech instead."
4,Creative webcam review,"This webcam is great except for the fact that if it sees something bright somewhere in the background, it will try focusing on that. Other than that this is really great."
3,nice cam with crappy software,I bought this camera around a month back ... it does the job of streaming pictures over messenger .. but the software is crappy ...i tried installing the software 3-4 times .. some issues with Quicktime player they say .. but never managed to click stills .. or record videos .. which should have been possible ..the interface to their software is not very good eitherall in all . it does a good job of a simple web-cam though .. nice n clear pic quality .. just that it freezes sometimes ..
4,This is quite nice,The quality is good and conveniently fits laptops of various thichness screen sizes
2,"Great for daytime usage, horrible for nighttime usage","I purchased this webcam to chat with my family, so the only requirements I had were that it give consistent good quality in bright light or low light. I use the webcam at night mostly, and this webcam doesn't work very well in nighttime lighting. When exposed to artificial light, it doesn't know how to handle the brightness well automatically, and you have to change some of the configurations, specifically in the brightness, to adjust to your indoor lighting. The webcam should do this for me but it doesn't do a good job of it. In the daytime, however, it works great and the transmission is a lot smoother than at night. With nighttime usage, I get a strange ghost trail from any movement, whereas in the daytime there is none of that at all. I do not use the facial autofocus very much or very often, but it does work well."
4,"Worth the price,Good Face Tracking and motion sensor feature","Well i am pretty statisfied with the webcam, althought the performance is not the best in low light but i think its the same case with all webcams in this price range.the Face Tracking and Motion Detection feature is real nice and works pretty good. The webcam clips nicely to any laptop or desktop screen.U must install the software that comes with this webcam to see an image that is good in brightness and contrast by adjusting the brightness and contrast in the software otherwise the image would be dark.Overall a nice webcam."
3,Performance doesn't warrant price,"Nice camera, but too expensive. Tracking software is basically fluff. Even though this is a 1 meg camera, the best you can do with free IM software (AIM, Y!M,) is 1/4 VGA."
5,All you could ask for in a Webcam,"Easy to setup, easy to use, reasonably priced. What else could you ask for?"
1,not compatible with vista and beyond. avoid,"Creative WebCam is no longer compatible with Windows since XP. Will not work with Vista, Windows 7 etc.Do not buy this product. But anyway you probably know this since external webcams are becoming more and more obsolete and unnecessary."
1,I never receive this webcam,"I guess , i lost my mony , because this company never sent to my the item , also never answer my e-mails"
4,Good product,"Nothing to write home about... it works, unfortunately not in Linux. I have not tried too hard to get it working in Linux, but it definitely does not work out of the box on Ubuntu, even in Gutsy."
4,Works great,I've had it for a while and have never experienced any problems with it. The only thing I would say is that you need to make sure you use it in a well lit area.
1,Horrible customer service,"I tried to set up remote monitoring and had a question on two fields in the set up. The manual didn't have the answer so I logged a question via email. I tried it twice because both technicians just referred me to the manual or provided a small amount of information that was completely unrelated to the question.I opened a call and after being on hold for 10 minutes was told that they don't support remote monitoring even though it's part of their product. I asked to talked to a supervisor, was put on hold for another 5 minutes, and then was told by the same person that the supervisor is just going to tell me the same thing. When I requested a call back he agreed and started to hang up. I asked what phone # he was going to use and he gave some # that wasn't even close to mine.This product may be good once you get it set up, but I'll never buy another product by this company due to the extremely poor customer service."
3,One of the world's best songs,"All I can say is that this CD is on my wish list for nothing other than ""Man Against the World"" which I swear is one of the best songs in the universe. It takes me back to high school in just a few notes and I can remember everything like it was yesterday. It still makes me teary-eyed!"
5,EXCELLENT !! A MUST !,I a real fan of Survivor and this album. A Great Album !!!!I'm listening to it again and again !!! Every song is a hit.Don't hesitate a second....
2,Cheesy lyrics,"THis album is very good. I'm particularly fond of REBEL SON and CAN'T LET YOU GO. But the lyrics became totally cheesy, albeit the songs are catchy."
5,Great KVM,I use KVM switches at work and at home and this be far has been the best one. Very easy to set up and use. Worked right out of the box. I use it on two XP boxes and found both and runs great. Cables where the right length. I have only used the switch on the box to move between the two PC and work great. Very little lag time between moving from one PC to the other.Great KVM for the price.
3,Tiny122,"Good device. Allows switching of keyboard, mouse, microphone and speakers. I suspect works great switching between Windows based machines. Disappointing that it does not work with Linux. The only way to switch from Linux is with the buttons on the box itself. Apart from that a nice cheap USB KVM."
5,A Very Satisfying Score,"Everything about this production is first-rate, from the intelligent lyrics, the sophisticated score, and the beautiful vocals. I highly recommend it."
3,"Good, but Mixed","While I did not catch this show on a recent trip to NYC, I purchased the cd based on reviews and multiple Tony nominations. Musically, the score is beautiful and the cast's voices are terrific (esp. Clarke and O'Hara), but the lyrics don't quite live up to the rest. Standout tracks include: ""The Beauty Is"", ""Dividing Day"", and ""Say It Somehow"" (though the rambling ""ah""s keep the song from perfection)."
3,"Interesting, but not compelling.","At least not on the audio CD - I certainly reserve final judgement until I have seen the entire production live. The instrumentation is very light and my preference is for the larger pit orchestra. If you like light Italian feel, this might be very nice for you, if not - there are others that will fulfull your desires better."
1,HO -HUM,"The score for this show makes dogs howl and cover their ears. And the lyrics for this show makes those same dogs wish they had fleas. Is this show romantic, a comedy, a drama or a spoof? I would guess a spoof with lyrics such as...naked marble boys rhymed with corderouys--after that the well runs dry...but wait! We don't need intelligent lyrics..we can always pad every number and I mean every number with oooohs and uhhhhs and more ahhhhhs than heard in a throat doctors examining room. And then fate dealt me a crushing blow.............I was in NY with a friend last month and we had seen a few shows but had a free night. I was horrified when she suggested this show but after much cajoling I was dragged kicking and screaming to the theatre. Ha! She was snoring in her seat by ""Passagiatta"" so we left at intermission and went and had a pizza. So the evening wasn't a total waste and the pizza was delicious."
1,Sadly Boring!,"I brought the CD on a recommendation of a friend who saw the show in NY and simply raved. I found the music quite pleasant but 15 minutes into it I found it had become just wallpaper music and several friends thought the same when I played it over to them. I am sure the if I had seen it on stage I would think otherewise, but as a cast album it does nothing for me. Sorry"
2,This Light Isn't Shinning On Me.,"Ok so I'm giving this Cd 2 stars because I don't want to burn it and roast marshmellows with it, like I want to with ""Bat Boy"",However I really don't get it. I see how people can say that the score is beautiful but it's boring and like half the songs are sung in italian. I don't speak italian so that turns me off of those right away. The rest are just so-so the only song I ever listen to is ""Statues and Stories"" but that one song isn't worth the 15 bucks I spend on this snoozer.Either save your money or go get the other Tony nominees from this year. Spamalot, The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, or Dirty Rottin Scoundrels. Or from last year's Tonys Avenue Q, Wicked, The Boy from Oz, Caroline or Change. Or from 2003, Hairspray, Amour, A Year with Frog and Toad, Movin' Out. Or 2002 Thoroughly Modern Millie, Urinetown The Musical, Mamma Mia!, Sweet Smell of Success. All are better than this one."
2,Disappointed,"The Light in the Piazza was so acclaimed as a musical in the great tradition of the composer's grand-father (Richard Rodgers) that I bought the cast album to familiarize myself with the music before seeing the show. (I have tickets for Sept. 24th.) In the golden age of American musical theater, a hit show spawned instant hit songs which were already very familiar to theatregoers when they entered the theater. I was sorry to find out that there is nothing in The Light in the Piazza that can become a hit tune. The lyrics don't even rhyme. This may turn out to be an effective show in the theater, but the plot and the actors will have to prop up the weak music. The cast album to me is a bust. It demonstrates that the score for this show cannot stand on its own. I'll go back to my cast albums of South Pacific, My Fair Lady, West Side Story, Gypsy, etc. These albums reveal the shows as works of genius. The Light in the Piazza is not a work of genius and the cast album demonstrates this."
3,Snoozeville,The only thing more sleep inducing than this cast album is sitting through the actual show. The music is very pretty but too similar and will lull you into a deep coma!
2,One of the Worst Musicals of the Millenium,"Not only does this show lack tune, but it lacks decent lyrics. With songs like ""Let's Walk"" and ""Statues and Stories"", not only are the lyrics repetative, but they have no rhyme.Adam Guettel is no tunesmith and no wordsmith either. How his score won the Tony of David Yazbek's genius ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" score is beyond me."
5,Refreshing New Musical,"I'm a big broadway fan, but I admit the trends toward the belting pseudo/pop of late are wearing a bit thin. A Light in the Piazza has revived my faith in the power of the American musical. It is unabashedly romantic, and one could call it old-fashioned, were it not so refreshing and beautiful. There are no gimmicks--just gorgeous music sung beautifully. The cast is virtually flawless, as are the orchestrations. It caught me from the first listen and has held my interest since. Highly recommended."
5,The best Broadway score in years!,"This is without a doubt the best new theatre music I have heard in years. Adam Guettel is a composer to be reckoned with. Granted his music can be challenging, the experience is well worth the effort. Not only is Guettel's score gorgeous, it is remarkably intelligent. As such, many theatregoers probably won't appreciate it. Too bad for them."
1,Boring Operettic Sondheim wannabe Garbage,"And NO I do not agree that the lead female singer was brilliant. She has the same naisely ""Disney Mermaid"" qualities as everyone else of this generation. Not that I'm expecting Merman, but I grow so weary of witless lyrics and music, and singers who think ""Linda Ronstant sings Gershwin"" is a golden oldie."
5,No Wonder it is a Tony Award Winner!,"The Tony nominations and awards handed out to ""The Light in the Piazza"" are well deserved based on the broadway score alone. I have never seen the show but fell in love with the one song they performed at the 2005 Tony Awards and I absolutely love this cd. This is another one of those great cd's from a Broadway show! I absolutely love it!"
5,GORGEOUS!,"I think this musical is just gorgeous. The singers, especially Ms. Clark and Ms. O'Hara, are out of this world. As a legit singer myself, it is wonderful to hear a musical with beautiful singing instead of all the belty/shouty stuff that is more popular. The story is poignant and the music is wonderful. If you are into music that is more lyrical that pop, this is the musical for you.Voice Lessons To Go v.1-4 The Complete Set"
4,Nice for price,"the ""red"" dims quite a bit when you wash your hands with it on alot, but its heavy and fairly good quality"
5,Championship Volleyball Techniques and Drills,Championship Volleyball Techniques and Drills should be in every volleyball coach's library. The Chapters break down in detail the skills needed to play the game and drills to improve skills. I refer to this book once a week.
5,Great Book. I highly recommend it!,"As Vice-President, Customer Care, I was looking for a book that would help me in capturing relevant and actionable customer feedback. I found this book to be an excellent resource for me and my team in understanding the principles critical to designing effective customer surveys. The many questionnaires provided in this book gave us 'food for thought' and were leveraged to assist us during our design phase. As a result, we were able to create a highly successful survey effort and realized a(24%) response rate! I would highly recommend this book."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this book as it appeared to be of the few practical ones available of this subject. I found it simplistic. It provided no discussion of individual examples other than a overall checklist, and in some chapters gave theoretical backgrounds and then provided examples that didn't apply the theory at all. Find a better way to spend your $50."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!! SUPERB!!!! FANTASTIC!!!,"I'd recomend this short but awesome book to ANY truck enthusiast. It has the model and style history of over 18 semi truck manufacturers, as well as awesome photos. JUST BUY IT, OK?"
5,Nice little Trucking Book,"Pretty good book,small softcover, has nice pics, good reading, Missing Chevy Heavy Duty, But Covers GMC (Astro 95,General,Brigadier). Good book overall."
4,Kinski - 'Alpine Static' (Sub Pop),"Good current CD release by the Seattle experimental/space rockers. Think I liked the disc's two lengthiest tracks the best, ""Passed Out On The Lawn"" and ""Edge Set"" which both clock in at around nine minutes. Also dug the electronic weirdness used in the background on tunes like ""Wives Of Artie Shaw"" and ""Hiding Drugs In The Temple"". Sort of reminds me of vintage Hawkwind. Funny, how I haven't seen that mentioned anywhere else. Overall, you get nine (9) cuts of trippin' mind music, JUST the way you like it. Might appeal to fans of Acid Mothers Temple, SubAracnoid Space, Bardo Pond and possibly Flying Saucer Attack. Recommended."
3,in a class all their own,"While it may seem odd that I say Kinski is ""in a class all their own"", then proceed to give Alpine Static a middle ground three stars, I am writing more to talk about Kinski's entire catelogue. Alpine Static is, in my opinion, Kinski's weakest album. It doesn't have the same amount of struture and layers as their previous releases. Alpine is a good effort, but if you really want to know Kinski, check out Be Gentle With The Warm Turtle, Airs above Your Station, or their reissue Spacelaunch For Frenchie. Each one of these three records receive FIVE stars from this reviewer."
4,Chill Music,"Kind of a mellow relaxed noise, good for the type of people who enjoy the genre.. I think I like their last release a little better though :)"
3,Something missing...,"I absolutely loved the first two books that went with this series. However, there is something missing in this third installment. The author does not seem as committed to the characters or the story as she had been in the previous two books. This book jumps great periods of time leaving the reader wondering what happened. It felt rushed. The story is still good and worth reading."
1,Waste of Money!,"It is too bad that there was nothing less than ""1 star"". I bought this drugbook to help me thru a pediatric rotation in nursing school. I dont think I was able to use it at all. Every drug that I attempted to look up WAS NOT in this book, it was useless and a total waste of money. I dont recommend anyone buying it. Im not sure who uses the drugs in this book because there useless. Even the most common pediatric meds are no where to be found! :("
3,"Good, but didn't meet expectations.","I am a great fan of Will Durant. I have read several of the volumes from the ""Story of Civilization"" series. This book is enjoyable, but lacks the insight and depth that his other books show. His conclusions are true, but not new."
1,disappointing,There is a reason that this recent book is out of print while many classics have been in print for hundreds of years. There is a reason it is in audio recording form and not print form.The authors talk with extreme confidence but talk at random. When they discuss things I am a minor expert on I find that they are way off base. One amusing thing is their projections into the future that are totally wrong after less than 40 years.I get the impression that this book was aimed at people who failed to qualify to enter college but wanted to put on airs of being intellectuals.
4,Everyone should read it,The lessons of history keep repeating themselves over the centuries and this explains the tides of history we need to be aware of.
5,"6,000 Years In a Nutshell","This book is a swift collection of fascinating ideas. It reminds me of Jacques Barzun'sFrom Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life 1500 to the Presentin its ability to draw ideas from the famous events and characters of history. Since it is so quick, one isn't able to follow the roots of the ideas that surface like one might with Barzun. One must take the author's word for a lot of his conclusions. But, the thoughts stimulated from this survey are quite rewarding nonetheless. Those concepts, as identified by the chapter headings, on nature, biology, race, character, morals, religion, economics, socialism, government, war, growth and decay, and progress, amount to the great concepts of human existence. Anyone interested in being human will thoroughly enjoy this book."
3,Sadly now very dated,"""... only a fool would try to compress a hundred centuries into a hundred pages of hazardous conclusions. We proceed."" -- Will and Ariel DurantEssentially a short book (or longish essay) of musings about culture, religion, and government by the Durants based on their years of research and writing for the massive 10-volume History of Civilization. Unfortunately their vast knowledge did not seem to help them understand or accept the cultural upheavals of the 60's and the early signs of globalization... the book feels extremely dated now in parts, especially their observations on the superiority of the northern European races, the supposed effects of immigration and mixing, and the role and future of the Roman Catholic Church."
4,A better listen,"I actually heard this book rather than read it and listening to the ageing Durants was a rewarding experience. I wonder if I would have been able to actually read it. Some books, like this with philosophy content, are probably better heard by laymen. I think it's an important book to those who wish to explore about our evolution from a practical perspective."
4,Deep thought process,If you are a lover of history you will love this very deep book. If you are looking for a light read this is not it. I got through the tape set but it was rough at times.
3,history,"I am a bit disappointed. The Story of Civilization, Mansions of Philosophy, and The Story of Philosophy and all good reading. This book [The Lessons of History}, to me is not up to par with the other material. I have read only about a third of it, and had trouble becoming engaged in what was before my eyes. I kept waiting to be glad I ordered it, but this has not yet happened.Sorry folks. You may like it.M. Thorne"
5,Gorgeously illustrated with impressionist-style color artwork by Alfred Currier,"Gorgeously illustrated with impressionist-style color artwork by Alfred Currier, How Far To Heaven? is a charming children's picturebook about the lifelong bond between grandmother and granddaughter. Grandpa has passed on, yet Nanna is comforted by the knowledge that he is in the paradise of Heaven; she is always listening for angels. When Nanna and her granddaughter venture into the woods together, they see beautiful wonders of nature and Nanna tells her granddaughter a special secret. ""Grandpa said that in heaven an angel would be at my side. Do you not know you are my angel?"" A heartwarming, life-affirming book intended for young readers of all religious backgrounds (there is no explicit reference to any specific Christian scripture or dogma other than the general concepts of heaven and angels), highly recommended."
4,A read not to pass up,"Infused with literary mastery, somber truths, delightful narrative and a study of the rediculous, this is a book that any serious reader of poetry would enjoy. It has the form of a dream state, with passive-aggressive surrealism similar to Dream Songs and some modernist literarature, such as Joyce and Beckett. When you read this book, you will be decoding a sort of dream-state disconnected from the world around you, though very much present in that deeper, darker, truer and sometimes more humorous reality of the unconscious.If you are looking for an intimate look into the nature of language, and a view into the mind and life of an author who breaks from traditional and pop poetry as he creates a work riddled with originality, I recommend this book. Happy reading!"
2,I couldn't get into it ...,"I couldn't get past the ponderously heavy and extensive history that opens the book. I didn't even get to chapter two. Heck, I was snoozing by the second page.I'm more of a Butcher fan.If you are a history buff, or like your SciFi/Fan/Hor steeped in background, this might be a perfect fit."
1,Very disappointing after reading other reviews,"This is my genre. I read a lot of fantasy with and without vampires. this was one of the clumsiest books I've ever read. I felt nothing for the main character, he was weak and annoying. And the writing? The style is distracting and clumsy and the dialogue is just plain terrible. I forced my self to finish it becayse I finish everything. But I gave it to Goodwill and will not read the rest. I might try one of this other series/stories, just to see what the fuss is about him. Terrible book. Would recommend it to anyone."
2,Disappointing,"A very ordinary fantasy novel. While described as ""dark"" and ""erotic,"" it was neither. In truth, it was boring. I found myself skimming pages at a time waiting for the plot to develop while the author nattered on about dark deeds that occurred eons before the story in question. The plot is thin, the fantasy world created is not novel and for those who are looking for a good vampire read, the vampire aspects of the book are slight."
4,Quite Cute,"This pan is quite cute, but a bit on the small side without really being a mini-cake pan. I will probably have to buy another to be able to make a cake that can be eaten by more than two people. However, the brand is good."
1,specs wrong.,this cable may work for some application and useage language is not plainly stated for a typical person. i was not able to interpret clearly until i had cables in hand a found them to not be what i thought i was ordering. i ended up ordering from a better know company who plainlt described the use of their cable sets.
1,Defective Cable,The cord i recieved is defective. It doesnt work. I've tried it with multiple computers on multiple tv's to be sure it was actually the cable. I didnt bother sending it back because shipping was as expensive as the product.
1,it might have been good if it worked!,"I was very excited to get this cable, so I could hook my computer up to my television. But after trying the cable on multiple TVs with multiple computers, i have come to the conclusion that my wire did not work. nothing but fuzz would come through on the TVs. So if the product had not been a dud, it would have been a great accessory to my computer. Now it is just a hunk of metal chillin' in my house."
5,Excellent value for its price,Cable works like a charm. does what its supposed to doconnect my hdtv receiver to lcd projector.excellent clarity and solves my purpose at a low pricethx
1,Guaranteed to fall apart right out of the box,"As soon as I opened the box a small wheel fell off this vacuum. I called Eureka customer service and they can't send me the part. Instead, I have to take it to be repaired. Even though it's under warranty, I shouldn't need to wait for a repair straight out of the box. This is not shipping damage- the plastic piece that is supposed to hold the wheel is defective. In order to box this machine at the factory someone had to hold this wheel in place in order to get it in its plastic bag without falling apart- it's that loose!"
3,Good but not great...,"I've tried a lot of different travel books and thought that I would try yet another new one for when my girlfriend came to visit me in San Francisco. I found the guide to lack sophistication and I didn't like the organization of the top ten lists. However, the map at the rear of the book was very good and the illustrations are nice. I'd say that it was better than having nothing but if I could do it again I probably would have purchased a different guide."
1,Eyewitness top 10 San Francisco,"I am disappointed in the format of the travel book on the Kindle format. It is not easy to navigate and all of the beautiful pictures are black and white and tiny. The paper version is vibrant, with large pictures and in this case the paper version wins hands down. It's a shame, because I thought ""what a convenient, light way to take my multiple travel reference books with me.""Top 10 San Francisco (EYEWITNESS TOP 10 TRAVEL GUIDE)"
3,STOP! Stand there where you are...and DON'T buy this version of the CD!!!,Immediately search for the album again and get the 'limited edition' version with the two bonus tracks. It's less money than this version--and the two bonus tracks are two of Erasure's best!!!
2,THREE STARS,"UPDATE: After giving it a few more listens, I have to say it sounds a little better. I'd upgrade my star rating for this to 3 stars if it were possible.I've been listening to Erasure for over 20 years, seen them perform live a number of times, and after the sublime and beautiful ""Nightbird"", it is disheartening to report that this one just doesn't measure up to their previous efforts. Technically, the music is very well produced. The problem is that there is hardly anything that stays with you after listening. I've heard it once, and will likely give it another chance but it's pretty sad when you have to say that about an Erasure album. L.A.T.E.O.T.W is a disappointment, and boring at times. There's little magic to be experienced. If anything, this album sounds like a collection of sub-par b-sides. The packaging for the limited edition is alright."
3,"Ok, but there have been better","I don't usually like CDs the first time I hear them unless exceptionally good. this was no exception. The music is good but the vocals are often drowned out by too loud music. The music is mostly good and the vocals are good but most of the songs I believe aren't up to their caliber. Feels rushed to prove a point they are still relevant. Nightbird was good and well done and only a couple of years ago. I don't see why it had to be rushed. I do like the album better now after a few times but still lyrics are not the greatest. If a fan of course you must have. If new to Erasure try Erasure, Cowboy, or Nightbird first."
3,"Another Loveboat, I'm affraid...","Just when I thought they had recoverd their inspiration (after ""Other people's songs"" and Nightbird"") they release this hard-to-swallow bluff. I had a terribly sad dejá-vu and thought I was listening again (and it would be the second listening) the awful Loveboat.How can they be so uneven?Anyway, I'll go on buying their music..."
3,okay...just okay,"Erasure is to the point in their career where they need to either do something different (and I don't mean acoustic sets), or they need to excel at their signature sound; this album, I'm afraid, does neither. Some of the keyboard sounds hark back to yesteryear, but the songwriting just isn't able to compete. The soulful, happy hooks that made Erasure famous are all but absent. The best track is actually not even a track; the b-side, ""I Like it"", is actually one of the best songs they've done in years. Had ""Light at the End of the World"" followed suit, this would have been an amazing record."
3,Good but not as good as it should be,"After an album like Nightbird, which was fantastic and in my opinion their best ever, it's hard to follow up with an album thats just as good. There are quite a few good songs like Sunday girl, how my eyes adore you, and fly away and then there are others that i didn't really care for like Darlene and glass angel. Andy's vocals are good but I feel like more sounds should've been used instead of nonstop synthesizers. I hate to say it but every song kind of sounds the same. Overall, the album is just okay. It's not dreadful but it's not great either."
3,Not their best and certainly not their worst.,"This is not a bad album, but it is not their best. I agree that this returns to the dancier pop sounds of Chorus and prior albums. Still, it is missing that that depth and originality that will make these songs classics similar to A Little Respect, Blue Savannah, I Love To Hate You or Always.What you have here is a polished, enjoyable but somewhat samey sounding album. I love this band, and I really want to love this, but it just seems like an average album to me. I guess all fans will have their favorites. I lean more towards the synthy sweetness of I Say X 3 and the ambient explorations of the Erasure album. Regardless of my thoughts on this album, I am thrilled that Vince and Andy continue to make music and tour the US.Highlights of this release for me are Storm In A Teacup, Fly Away and When A Lover Leaves You."
4,Yes!,"I find it funny when someone comes into review a cd, perhaps after one listen and write up a slam dunk hate it critique. Admittingly, the first few times I listened to this new offering from Erasure, I had the same attitude as many reviewers...the same ol same ol. But upon many more listens, it all clicked and I'd have to say without a doubt, the BEST Erasure has offered since Chorus. It's truly Erasure back to it's old form, excellent catchy melodies that will have you singing in the shower each morning. Andy Bell is truly in top form both lyrically and vocally. Job well done guys."
2,Don't Like It,This is one of the very few Erasure albums where I can't think of a single track where I would want to place in my mp3 play list.
1,Boring....,Erasure really disappoints with this one...same old sound and no creative hooks. I think I am officially off the fanclub.
2,Let Down,"After the return to form with Nightbird and the change of pace of Union Street I was looking forward to the new material. Unfortunately this just doesn't cut it. The supposed dancier tracks sound as if they were written by an early 90s euro band and that Erasure hasn't moved on. Clearly with their eponymous album and Nightbird this is not the case. ""If I Could Fall In Love With You"" is a high point as it's the type of track they do so well. However, ""Sucker For Love"" sounds like a failed Eurovision song at best.I guess I'll have to go back to listening to Nightbird."
5,Tip-top pop,If you like your music poptastic buy this album now. Regardless of whether you've bought Erasure before this album is a stand out piece of fun pop.
5,There is light at the end of the world,"I don't know why I waited so long to get the latest Erasure album LIGHT AT THE END OF THE WORLD since I am such a huge fan of the synthpop group. I am glad I finally got it. LIGHT AT THE END OF THE WORLD is classic Erasure all the way with the group's infectious melodies and earnest lyrics. The album is just under 40 minutes long but it is 39 minutes of synthpop bliss. The lyrics on this album reflects the break up between Andy and his partner, a relationship that lasted for nearly twenty years. Despite the tone of the subject matter, the songs are surprisingly upbeat beat-wise as well as lyrically. There is no bitterness or rancor. One of my personal favorite songs on the album is ""Sunday Girl"". The addictively catchy melodies makes it hard for me to listen to the song just once. The rest of the album is a lot of fun to listen to. I have to admit I had to listen to the album a few times before the music really sunk into my head. Overall great album."
2,Not for those with truly dry skin,"I don't normally have dry skin, but my skin gets on the dry side in the winter time. So, I ordered this in the fall hoping it would provide an extra moisture boost in the cold, winter months. This product totally failed to deliver an adequate amount of moisture. I was pretty disappointed because I've liked Derma-E's other products. Don't get this if you have dry skin."
5,Dry skin begone!,"Derma e Avocado and E cream is outstanding, especially for dry skin on the hands. It is quickly absorbed into the skin and leaves no oily residue. It has no discernable odor. And the price is right!"
4,Good book about marketing a mini-farm,"I really enjoyed this book. My only complaint, is that I wish the author had gone into the growing aspect a bit more. The book turned out to be more of a marketing book. Great book for a niche that needed to be addressed in a bit more detail, but not the book I thought I was getting. My two favorite books thus far on the subject of mini farming have beenMini Farming for Self SufficiencyandThe New Organic Grower: A Master's Manual of Tools and Techniques for the Home and Market Gardener (A Gardener's Supply Book)."
5,Backyard Market Gardening: The Entrepeneur's Guide to Selling What You Grow,"My Husband has not put this book down since it arrived! It contains exactly the information he's been looking for to help him make the right decisions about selling what we grow. Needless to say, this book gets a very high rating for content!"
4,For those of us with a hippy soul,"This is a good book to have if you decided to get back to nature, downsize your life, get with it or just make ends meet when food prices are going up, up, up. Just know that it takes a lot of work, especially if you are into organic. That said, this is a good start on making money with gardening when you don't have a acres of land. My lot is 1/3 of an acre and it is quite productive. This book helps you make the best of what you have. I recommend it. I didn't give it five stars because it doesn't have all that much that's new to me, but then again I read a lot."
2,Out of date,"There is some great info in this book, but most of it is so out of date now as to render the book fairly useless. I'm sure this was a terrific guide in the 90s, but it badly needs to be updated to reflect changes in the market and pricing."
5,Very pleased,"As a person who is looking towards expanding my garden, I was looking for a kind of a 'how to' book. While the book does contain 'testimonials,' it is contains a great deal of information on getting your produce to market. The types of ideas that I had not considered prior to reading the book. The book reads fast and concerns itself primarily with marketing your produce. If you're looking for primer on marketing your produce, this is an excellent first choice."
3,Grunt Records Debut,"With Marty Balin departed, the Airplane now flirts with more experimentation and variation than ever before. It seems that Grace gets more to the point singing in German. And the mostly acapella ""Thunk"" has unsuccessful Band-like harmonizing. There's a meandering blues instrumental with Papa John Creach's fiddle screech in prominence. And then there's Paul Kantner's three sci-fi contributions that show things are wearing thin. Still, Grace's rebellious ""Lawman"" and the self-scrutiny of Jorma's ""Third Week In The Chelsea"" work. And the two great ones, the haunting FM single, ""Pretty As You Feel"" and Jorma's bluesy ""Feel So Good"" are much more knowing than earlier insipid love songs. The fact that these are also the two catchiest numbers with their funky instrumental interplay don't hurt either. But this record has a tossed off feel and is strange to be sure."
4,"inconsistent, but contains some good material","It is not as good as the first five Airplane studio albums, but it has some solid tracks, tracks 1-4 and 8, in particular. With a programmable CD player, you won't have to worry about the tracks that don't pass muster."
2,Never argue with -- a -- German?,"If you do nothing else with this album, at least be sure to play the piece, ""Never Argue With A German If You're Tired Or European Song"" for somebody who actually knows the German language!Clue: You needn't know a nuance of German to hear what's goi0ng on, here. Like those funny posters that you stare at, just listen with ""blurry ears,"" if you will, and pretend that it's not German but English -- 'cause it's NOT German but, rather, Slick's own comic genius at play, with her own unique spoof ""Germanized"" English!!Listen!Pay attention and just listen!""Schticken in mein hochen...""Say, what!?"
1,Paper or plastic?,"This is the album that came wrapped in a paper bag. Should have stayed there. Yikes! What a lousy album. It did, unbelievably, generate a charted single; ""Pretty As You Feel"" made the lower rungs of the Billboard Hot 100, their last to do so. For that accomplishment, I give them some credit. But this album still is a stinker. Get ""Surrealistic Pillow"" instead."
4,Don't Turn Away...Listen and Be Suprised!,"Yes, its post Marty Balin, but in my book that's not neccessarily a bad thing..yes there are some clunkers -""Thunk"" and ""European song"", but many classics emerge i.e. ""Lawman"", ""Chelsea"",""War Movie"" and ""Pretty as You Feel""...all in all a solid effort from the quintescential 60's band striding into the 70's."
3,Never argue with a dog if you're a tollbooth,I don't understand why 'Bark' cops so much bad press. It's a mixed bag for sure but I look at it as being pretty fresh in the scheme of things as it offers a degree of variety we had not heard before but neither is it just a curiosity. There's some weaker material on it but no bad material there either. A worthy addition to any collection.
2,Cushion is useless,"Pros:1. Good Idea.2. Keeps back straight.Cons:1. The cushion is to soft and does not support our weights (150lbs and 185 lbs)2. This creates pressure points on the knees, tibia and buttocks.3. Thus becoming painful after 30 min.Conclusion: should know better what to expect for a $60 chair!"
3,A favorite of Garrison Keillor,"In Georgia Blount grew up dreaming of being a four sport immortal. He thought that MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE was art. His was a teetotaling Southern Methodist household. Blount would not buy anything called L.A. Gear for New York walking. When he went to a health spa he thought he was going crazy listening to people talking about their bodies as if they were endlessly fascinating motorcycles. A cat will mouse for you, but maybe a mouse-free house is no better than a house without kitty litter. He wonders what if the reading faculty atrophies in our culture. In summer people sit a lot and read a lot. Winning is the ethic of football he claims Don Shula once said. It is no wonder that Garrison Keillor likes this book. Unfortunately it is topical and so has gotten sort of old. We have new crazes now."
3,Liner notes? What liner notes?,"Not sure if the CD packaging is defective but the inside of the CD I have a picture of trees at the bottom with no type what so ever. So the only thing I have is the song list, no indication of who is playing on what."
5,Great violin strings,Excellent quality violin strings and the price is reasonable. These strings sound great on all of my violins. I got tired of paying high prices.....I can buy two sets of Zyex for what I was paying for the famous competitors.
1,"Service is good, product is not","Shipping and service are good.However, the item is not very good. Of those 4 strings, G string has some unwound spots right out of its package and A string is sounding bad just after a few days playing."
4,Great strings for the money,"I got these strings for a very nice student violin I use for teaching. Didn't really want to put on Dominants which are a bit pricey now so I decided to explore other synthetic strings. The Zyex set seems fine; very warm, with clear projection. 4 stars only because I would not put them on my good instruments, which have Obbligatos. Highly recommended."
3,Unneeded war,Korean War is tragedies and suffering without other reasons. The war is created for the self-serving people who want to have their satisfactions. It is shame that we allowed this happened.
4,My 4-year-old is hooked on this book,"On receiving the book I was initially skeptical: its a very simple story (all in German) with a short dictionary and some songs. However my 4-year-old has wanted to listen to nothing else for the past 2 weeks and seems to be really familiarizing with at least the sound, and likely the meaning of the German language. He now roams around the house saying ""Prinzessin, wo bist du?"" and regularly calls us (his parents) Vati and Mutti. The tape works well and the songs are catchy enough for kids to pick-up and memorize. Not sure how it would work for kids over, say, age 6 or 7."
3,Cute story,"The story is cute. My kids like it. I am not fond of the songs in the back. They made up new lyrics to old tunes and I would have preferred to just have traditional German songs, like in the first book of this series (The Five Crayons)."
3,"Above all, average","Having read this book whilst waiting to drop the kids off at the pool, i was amazed to learn so much about Mr.Moyles despite his success. Most of the time it's hard to really learn anything about A-list celebrities, but not Chris Moyles. He delivers it with passion and precision.First class read."
1,The book doesn't even exist yet!,I find it quite hilarious that people are 'reviewing' a book that Mr.Moyles himself hasn't even remotely finished yet as mentioned by him on his radio show. He even mentioned amazon and was equally puzzled himself given that there is no solid release date for his biography let alone the fact that he's only just began work on it lol.
4,You'll play this over and over again,"I first bought the tape of this album when it was originally released in 1977? ""Baby's On Fire"" was receiving a lot of airplay on Australian alternative radio (2JJ, now Triple Jay) at the time. I love this album for several reasons - the musicianship of all involoved, the wide contrast of material, the quality of the recording (I have doubts about how ""live"" this album is), and the fresh treatment of covers such as The Kinks' ""You Really Got Me"" and the Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"".Of course, Manzanera's soaring guitar work and Brian Eno's keyboard playing alone are good enough reasons to buy this CD."
4,Must-Have,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's a PERFECT live album. Even the version of ""You Really Got Me"" is great. In particular check out ""East of Asteroid"" and ""Sombre Reptiles"" - the latter was a song that I thought could never be played live, but they do even better than the album version. This album is a must have for a fan of any of these groups: The Beatles, Roxy Music, The Kinks, Quiet Sun, Genesis, Soft Machine, Henry Cow, King Crimson, etc, etc....."
4,"Good stuff, pretentious reviews","Reading these reviews reminds me of what was wrong with ""progressive"" rock in the 70s and early 80s. Like the genre, these reviews are pretentious, bombastic, full of themselve. C'mon, ""most important piece of vinyl ever recorded on the planet?""With that said, this is an awesome LP, as was 801's studio effort, Listen Now. At the time, a Rolling Stone reviewer called 801 ""the last of the great psychedelic bands."" Closer than to put this music in the same gob of goo as Yes, Gentle Giant, Genesis, etc."
2,Way Overrated -- The Studio Versions Are Definitive,"Before being a crab about this disc, I'll note that the otherwise unavailable cover version of Tomorrow Never Knows is terrific, & almost worth the price of the disc. However, this disc really isn't all that great. I couldn't look at all those 5 star reviews without saying something.Four tracks here are from Manzanera's wonderful Diamond Head disc. Not that the live versions are bad, but there really isn't a one that's better than the studio version. Some are just OK, clearly not up to the originals. As for the songs from Eno's solo discs, it would be unfair to expect anyone to replicate the incendiary guitar work from ""Baby's On Fire."" I can't believe anyone would really prefer this version over the one on Here Come The Warm Jets. ""Somber Reptiles"" is an exceedingly odd choice (even for this bunch) to put on a live album.Completists will have to have this, but frugal shoppers should stick with the studio versions of these songs & call it a day."
2,deceived,"We had a couple of different cappuccino machines for more than 23 years and were very exited about upsclaling our purchase . The espresso from this machine is very good but it was always difficult to get a consistant foam, sometimes it was great sometimes not. The machine was incredibly loud and shook a little, the quality of the coffee lessened after a year, the worst was that the steam knob broke while making froth, (luckily nobody was hurt), and that was only one year and a half after purchase. I would not recommend that machine. We are on the market for one now, the shortest time for a machine in our house! Over $200???????????"
5,Do You Feel Lucky?,"This double feature blu-ray set is the cost effective way to add old movies to your library. I like that there is a disk for each movie. Some older DVD movie double-feature sets have a movie on each side of a single disk. Having separate disks is much better. ""Dirty Harry"" movies are classics. If you were expecting a review of the film, there are plenty of those to Google."
5,What a bargain!,"This is a must have for Dirty Harry fans. The picture and sound are awsome,and lets not forget the low price,what more could you possibly ask for? Well I guess free would be one of the things I could ask for,but that will never happen.I love it.Thank you.Jeff Hall"
5,Great Set,"Great deal. The two great movies look nicely updated in blu-ray. Aside from the great films themselves, I was surprised to find a lot of additional material on both discs. The beauty of blu-rays/dvds (at least for me) are all the extras that can be added to help give a picture of what went on to make the films. The films are on separate discs making for overall better quality. If you're eager to add to your Clint Eastwood collection, this set is a great next purchase."
1,Vendor doesn't sell the original film,"Have ordered several units of this film, hoping to get the original Panasonic brand as pictured, however I got the OEM compatible film...same dissappointment as the other buyer!!"
5,Exactly what I needed,I have a Panasonic fax machine at home. This ribbon is the exact replacement I needed. The $10.00 price was fantastic. The same ribbon cartridge at Staples (Staples brand cartridge) was about $45.00.
5,Amazon changes vendors,"I ordered my ribbon a few weeks ago. Vendor listed on the Amazon web page was different then. The vendor I ordered from, 'Tech Supply Center', shipped me a genuine Panasonic replacement ribbon package (two ribbons, for $18.99, free shipping, no tax). I'm totally satisfied with the product and the service. I guess, even though the Panasonic packaging is pictured, that's not always what you get. Watch out for the word 'compatible' in the product description."
2,Reason,"Tao is frequently translated as 'reason' in this translation and I personally believe that this is a folly and a fatal flaw. Tao can be reason, following tao is a reasonable thing to do. However Tao can also be instinct which is almost the opposite of reason. Most translations do not attempt to replace the word Tao with another, Tao is the indescribable, the formless, the nameless - to try to define it with a restrictive English word such as 'reason' is ill advised. Clearly defining Tao takes 81 chapters of philosophy and common sense, it cannot be abbreviated into two syllables."
5,Wonderful book about a great city.,"The Stones of Naples is the only book in English on the architecture of medieval Naples, and it's a wonderful read. These churches - Sta. Chiara, San Lorenzo, the Cathedral (among others) are only a few of the impressive buildings of the ancient center of this marvelous city. With excellent illustrations, groundplans, and reconstructions, the author unravels the sometimes complicated stories of these beautiful buildings in relation to the topography of what may be the oldest city in Europe."
4,eb5 face formula for men,my wife says I look better when using it. There is not much out there for men. this one works for me.
2,Not a Good Value,This is a good moisturizer but there are many good moisturizers out there for much less money. One and done.
3,It's okay,Have been using a different cream and thought I would give this a chance because of price per ounce. Seems a little heavy and not as rich as I had hoped. Will go back to my other cream.
2,Not so effective on me,"It's been 3 weeks now that I've been using this cream, twice daily as recommended. I finished the jar already and the results are far from being tremendous1. Don't count on it to lose any unwanted curves. It won't make your legs slimmers. I have monitored every area on my body I apply the cream on and check the size of my thighs every 2 days, and they have not shrunk a single millimeter.2. It does not have much action on cellulite. It seems like it does have a small improvement, but not enough to be remarkable or to justify the price of the jar3. My skin looks firmer. It's the only good result from the experiment. However, I have to say that I can have an identical result with any other cheaper Hydrating cream when applied twice a day.Conclusion: I'm not convinced that this cream has any tremendous action onto cellulite or any slimming action either. the same result can be obtained with any regular hydrating cream with a consistent massage."
3,Not sure if it does the job,"Have been using the product for a month now in conjunction to going to the gym. Skin is firm and smooth after application, however, haven't seen any really difference in terms of skinning. Do not like the smell."
2,Didn't see any results.,"This is a gimmicky cream, like most cellulite removal creams. If you look it up cellulite is genetic & it's controlled by exercise and eating well. I used the cream till the very end, it's moisturizing and it somewhat tightens your skin for a brief moment, but for long lasting results this isn't it. Not buying it again, I'll use regular creams."
2,Didn't seem to make a difference,I just finished the product and really cannot see any difference. The cream could also smell a little more appealing.
2,Too good to be true,"There is nothing you can buy in a jar that is going to get rid of cellulite or shrink anything. The scent is nice, its lotion. But I don't see any results after weeks. The only thing that is going to work is exercise or surgery. Don't waste your money."
3,"A bit of a let down, but ok.","I bought this with maybe too high hopes. At the very least, I thought it would be a good moisturizer. But alas, doesn't really do anything for my dry skin. I haven't seen any firming action going, but the cream does leave a nice tingly feeling. Might be better for someone who doesn't have dry skin."
1,Beware of side effects,"This product had limited reviews online but the few were positive, so I decided to give it a try. Just 24 hours after applying the firming cream (and also fatgirlslim scrub) to my thighs, I became extremely exhausted around noon--like the energy crash coffee drinkers get from lack of caffeine. It was hard to stay concentrated at work, and by 6 p.m., I was ready for bed. I don't drink soda or coffee, so maybe people who have caffeine in their systems won't have the same side effects. But after four days of crashing every day around noon, I stopped applying the firming cream and the scrub. Within a day, my drive/sharpness/energy levels were back to normal. I am unsure if the side effects were from both fatgirlslim products or just one; I still have cellulite, but at least I can function at work."
1,?,"i haven't completely used this yet but i brought this to make me slimmer, and it doesn't do that. the jar only says for cellulite."
1,"Why, oh, why, did I buy this again?","For the same reason that I buy discounted B12 injections and get excited about those weight loss gimmicks, I bough the Fat Girl Slim cream. Which does exactly as the jar says - keeps us fat girls WANTING to be slim, but failing miserably.I don't know what everyone is saying on here - maybe they have much more obedient cellulite - but my fatty tissue doesn't listen to rhyme nor reason and want to take over the world after it takes over my body, and no amount of cream is going to make my fat change its agenda.The cream does go on cool, and it may be tingly, but all that tinglyness does absolutely nothing in dissolving our fat. The cream MAY smooth out our appearance, but if we put any lotion on our drier areas, then of course we're going to get a smoother appearance there. Don't need this jar to tell us that.Overall, a disappointment. Mainly in myself for having bought this thing in the first place."
3,It smells good,"I don't think it lessened the appearance of cellulite, which was the goal, but it smelled good and was a nice lotion that smoothed the skin."
2,"Good moisturzer, not very good results","I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I really don't see the results. I used it continuously for two months along with the love handler and the fatgirlsleep, and did notice a difference, but I've had far better results with seaweed soap and exfoliants. Give it a shot, but don't count on a miracle.Edit:Sorry, I did say both. What I meant was that I noticed that my skin was more moisturized (which plumps up the skin making cellulite softer), but I saw no real benefit that could not be achieved from any good body lotion or oil."
4,Decent product...,Used this last summer. Helped smooth my thighs some but had to keep applying to sustain the effect. My main complaint is that there is not much product for the price.
4,A Big FAT help,"I was extremely skeptical with this product, but I admit the name hooked me. It tones, tightens, and gives you less giggle and wiggle. Plus there is no medicine smell. The best part is the cost. You won't break the bank getting rid of the jiggly stuff. You can't beat that."
4,I love this stuff,"I'm nearly forty and I'm not going to give in to cellulite and wrinkles without a fight. I got this cream, and have been using it along with MBT trainer shoes and the occasional workout on an eliptical trainer. After one month, I'm starting to see results in the smoothness of my previously-lumpy legs. I can't say that it would work wonders alone, but as an add-on to an exercise program, it seems to be helping quite a lot. I've done weight-loss programs before, and they've never addressed the cellulite issue. This is the first thing that has seemed to work. And it's great moisturizer, too."
5,Love it!,"I have struggled with cellulite ever since I was 15 and this stuff finally made me look ""bikini-ready"". It takes a few weeks to notice results, but it is worth it."
3,Not a bliss for me...,"I've been using this product for the past 3-4 months, regularly, but I didn't noticed improvement on my skin appearance. Maybe it's not good for me!I like the smell, the texture and the fact that absorbs quickly.I'm not sure wheter I'll keep using this product in the future."
4,Reduces cellulite,This product did reduce cellulite within 20 days. I did rub it in for more then the recommended time on the product but it works fast and I barely have any cellulite on my legs now.
3,... mmmm,Did it get my skin more smooth? yesDid it reduce cellulite? yes and no (let me wait after a week after I finish it)Would say that you get what you pay in this case...If you need to make you look better before you go on holiday this product is ok.If you want to solve the problem I would go with something else.
1,"Charge for ""free shipping""??","I ordered this item once and all though I didn't see any change was willing to give it another try. This time around I noticed all though they advertise ""free shipping"" there is a a $4.49 shipping charge as I prepare to hit ""purchase"". (All other purchases are Amazon Prime in the below record, thus free shipping.) The business should advertise shipping costs honestly. Visited the sellers website and all though a phone number is listed (not convenient), there is no email address listed to address this issue. Not cool ""Divine Skin"".$49.95 + Free ShippingIn Stock.

5,Action-packed,"This is the third DVD of the second of third saga. It starts out with Saito and Kenshin entering Shishio's mansion and then Kenshin fights Senkaku, of course defeating him, then Sojiro, which in the process, Kenshin's reverse-blade sword is cut in half, which leaves Kenshin no choice but to hunt down the creator of it so he can continue his fight with Shishio and the Jupogottona. I don't want to spoil anything else, but this is one must-get DVD. Enjoy!!!!!"
5,Too amazing for words,"Whoa, the songs featured on this DVD are TOTAL hits! The videos are amazing quality, and the behind-the-scenes feature is hilarious (the HOT lead singer Alex is the one holding the camera most of the time). Also, the videos show Alex at his best, both in looks (did I mention how GORGEOUS he is) and vocally. Has anyone else noticed that the video you can download has Alex standing near the girl in the scene where she starts destroying things but in the Wherever You Will Go video (that is, the new one) all you see of Alex in that scene is a quick blur? It's a good thing they edited that in the new video because it didn't make much sense for him to be in the storyline scenes, just in the live band scenes."
4,McCulloch MCT2303A String Trimmer,"The trimmer arrived promptly and in good shape. I picked this particular trimmer because I had a Ryobi trimmer that was kaput. It was always a pain to start and, with the state of today's gasoline (going bad so quickly), I am avoiding occasional use gasoline tools, replacing as necessary with electric. This 'Mac' proved to be compatible with my Ryobi attachments (an edger and roto-tiller), saving me at least $100.00. My thanks to one of the earlier reviewers who said these were compatible.Purely as a string trimmer, it is not perfect in that the strings wear down to nubs very quickly. After trimming only about a 40' irregular line of tall grass, the strings were down to about 1"" in length. Since I also have the Ryobi trimmer head, this is no problem for me. I would highly recommend this product, especially if you have attachments you can use with it."
1,McCulloch Elec Trimmer,Purchasing the McCulloch Electric string trimmer was my first bad product experience for an item purcased through Amazon. This trimmer was defective out of the box. Was not even able to get it assembled because trimmer shaft and shaft to motor head would not connect. The bolt knob to tighten once together was also bent. I also purchased the Grass Gator 8010 Load N Cut Trimmer Head which on the site indicated it would fit the McCulloch Electric Trimmer. The Gator Head also will not fit this trimmer. I immediately returned all items on my order.
3,Need to be inventive to address line issue,"This is a really nice electric weed eater. It gets hot after a little while, but otherwise no mechanical issues so far. The real issue (as mentioned in other reviews) is the line replacement. I figured out how to order line hubs online, only to decide it was just too much of a pain to put the lines in them. So I found a generic replacement head for gas weedeaters that works great. You'll probably want to do this if you buy this product."
1,Agree with the previous review,"This is a poor design. I was excited to see 4 cutting strings, but in order to replace the lines you must take it apart and fit the strings into the little spaces. If they fit without using tools it might have been worth the time to replace them. Spend your money elsewhere."
3,Steve Howe Homebrew I,"This album is for listeners who want to hear the beginning gestations of songs that were further developed, and became either parts of songs or lesser known pieces to an album. It is interesting to hear the genesis of some of these songs in their rough versions when the final versions are already known. I look forward to obtaining the later renditions of ""Homebrew"" songs, versions 3 and 4. If you want the polished versions, don't go here.....but if you want a peak at how things start and develope.....here you are!"
4,Interesting Look Inside the Mind of Steve Howe,"In the progressive rock world, Steve Howe is a legend. This album is an interesting look at the writing process of the man. It is basically a collection of demos that Howe worked on before they would become heard in full form with Asia, GTR, and ABWH, as well as on his solo albums. Therefore, if you're a fan of these bands, it is quite a treat to hear songs like ""Red and White"" (what would be the basis of ""Birthright"" on _ABWH_), ""Never Stop Learning"" (would be used in ""Brother of Mine"" on _ABWH_), and ""More About You"" (what would be used in ""Quartet"" on _ABWH__). In addition, ""Rare Birds"" is known as the unreleased track ""Vultures"" from the original ABWH Sessions and the version on this album alone arguably justifies buying the CD. Howe sings on about half of the tracks, and it should be kept in mind that these are more or less ""advanced demos"", but for all of those who have followed Howe's career, this is essential."
4,"Calm, tranquil scent!","I really love this scent. If you're a big incense fan, you'll love the Nag Champa perfume oil. The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating is because it IS oil and therefore, it IS very greasy when you apply it. But the scent lasts for a long time and it definitely calms the nerves."
5,Must have,"Although it was one of their earlier releases, I didn't buy it until recently. I already have all their other cd's, which I love, so I figured I better get this one as well. What a great idea! I love this cd! You can tell that they love what they do and I know that a lot of people appreciate that! They are all amazing and very talented guys and I am so glad I bought it, finally!If anyone has not seen them live, I would definitely go do that as soon as possible!"
3,Not quite what I expected,"I bought this more for nostalgia, so in that case it gets 5 stars for pictures and memories. Most of the recipes are modern, yet impractical. There are a few that I would say are great heirloom recipes, but that's all."
2,Recipe book,"I didn't buy this book for the recipes in it. I bought it for the artwork. I am a fan of Tasha Tudor and just wanted to own some of her works. Again, as with the other books by Tasha Tudor, the illustrations are a bit disappointing. They are more sketchy than I would like. The colors are not vibrant, more washed out than anything. The children are not cute enough. I am a fan of recipe books and own the classics like ""Better Homes and Garden"", ""The Joy of Cooking"" and ""Betty Crocker"" cookbooks which include just about any recipe on this planet worth making. There were no recipes that I would try. Nothing new. This book wasn't as bad as ""A Time to Keep"" or ""Corgiville Fair"", but it did not meet my expectations. I wouldn't have bought it if I would have had the opportunity to view it beforehand. Sadly, I do not recommend purchasing it."
5,skirt,i have to say i really enjoyed wearing this skirt it worked well with what i had planned to wear it for. and it came on time
1,Dot not buy this skirt!,"I'm EXTREMLY disappointed with this 'skirt'! It is listed as a chiffon skirt, but it's nothing but cheap nylon and spandex! The quality is so poor! How can a seller label their product completely inaccurately!? Do not order this skirt if you're looking for a quality product!"
1,It tastes like chicken.,"Funny chicken, that is. Needlessly pretentious and overwrought chicken. And if anything could possibly be worse than the music, it would have to be Peter Sinfield's lyrics, which cause me to expectorate that aforementioned chicken with a violence bordering on the projectile. I can't believe this nonsense is still in print. Please do your duty as a citizen and help speed along the process of forcing this album out of print by NOT buying it. You will be amply rewarded for your efforts in the mercifully Kingcrimsonless afterlife."
1,Ecccch,"Listening to this CD is equivalent to Jean-Paul Sartre's vision of Hell in ""No Exit."" Imagine beingforced to listen to the most vapid, neurotic, boring person on earth describe to you, in excruciating detail, for hours on end, the details of his regular visits to the proctologist to have his hemmorrhoids looked at... Cube the effect and you have ""In the Wake of Poseidon."" Pretentious and overwrought playing, masturbatory guitar-playing, and perhaps the stupidest lyrics of all time... The only reason for the one star is that Tom Augenthaler and I used to have so much fun making fun of this album. We would suck down as much ganj as our lungs and skulls could take, and then read the lyrics in the voices of trained Shakespearean actors, and laugh ourselves nearly to permanent bladder damage... But that game can be played with any bad album, so let this puppy grow dust."
3,But it's abridged!,"Don't throw your vinyl version away yet unless it's unplayable. This ""remastered"" version deleted 33 seconds off the end on the title track! How could they do that? I A-B'd the vinyl and CD versions, and the CD version wins only in better high end detail and the lack of surface noise (which Atlantic pressings had in excess). The vinyl has a better low end (bass guitar and kick drum have a lot more punch). When I purchase a ""30th Anniversary Edition"" that is 24-bit remastered, I expect a better sounding recording than the original. Not here. It was remastered at Chop 'Em Out Studios. How appropriate! Fripp chopped his own recording."
2,"great album title, great artwork, horrible songs",i just don't like this album at all...larks' tongues in aspic fits better for me.
4,A solid performance with one sparkling gem,"Although it copies much of the format of the excellent five star ""In the Court of..."" this is still a very good album and indeed, ""Cat Food"" is in my opinion the best track from both these albums. Greg Lake's vocals and Pete Sinfield's wonderfully sarcastic lyrics on this track are worth the price of the whole album."
3,ruff but kc indeed,"This is propably the most ""skinny"" hardcore album that a progressive psy band can relase...robert fripp is a genious but the rest of the group seems to thinking at their future plans...I love it..."
4,A TOTALLY NEW EXPERIENCE,"I was caught totally off guard here. Had never heard Crimson before, I only admired John Wetton for his work in Asia ( a cheesy band, but Wetton vocals are amazing ). So, I went to buy a CD from Crimson. After some reasearch and hearing some opinions, I was convinced that ""RED"" was one of their best. I can't say if it is or not, but it's good. Impressible good! A journey into progressive music at his best. I'll never forget the firsdt impression I felt while listening to it for the first time, 26 years after it was released."
5,"An interesting album, as well as a great one","Red is by far one of my favorite Crimson albums, while the album works musically it also works visually, not in the realistic sense of things, but rather in the abstract. A song like the title track is the height of a ""visual"" song. Fripp's guitar playing is more droning, as is the album as a whole. Possibly influenced by drone notes in certain types of Indian music, the album has an eastern feel to it as a whole. Another interesting point is that this is one of Crimson's balenced albums. Obviously COTCK is not balenced as a whole, neither is LTiA. However this album balences quite well. Rather than focusing on the songs as a series, or group, the pieces work individually. Stellar performances as usual from Wetton(his best sung album)Bruford and Fripp. High praise to Marc Charig, Robin Miller, Mel Collins, and David Cross as well."
5,Still stunning,". When this album came out it was a staple of my friends and myself. I lost touch with it for 25 years, loved it in my head but did not play it. I have recently gotten reaquainted with it and it still holds it's incredible power. We all thought it sounded like the devil's badass music. I still believe it was and is amazingly structured but wonderfully free improv. My drum hero will always be Bruford."
4,AWESOME ALBUM!!!!!,"I gave 4 stars only because of 'Providence',it doesn't seem to fit well on this album. The other 4 songs are totally awesome. I own about 700 albums and most of what I bought doesn't stand the 'test of time',THIS ONE DOES. If you're thinking about buying ""RED""- GREAT CHOICE!"
5,Mind-Blowing Material,"This is still one of my favorite KC discs, and deservedly so. Not much I can say can expand significantly beyond what others have already written here. This is a classic, and to those who say this is just ""noise"" (especially regarding ""Providence""), I say this: Just go back to your Britney Spears records and leave us prog rock people alone, okay?"
5,not for those who suffer from migraines,"One of the great albums of the 70s from a band always determined to break the boundaries. Bill Bruford was as impressive in concert as on this album (and a an inspiring player for me as a younger drummer/musician). This is as good, if not better, than anything you'll hear today"
1,AAAAAARGH!,Can we please lose the association between this album and the Band Flotsam & Jetsam? Should we punish one of the best bands to come out of the trash being produced in the 1990s by mistakenly listing this album among their works? This album relates to a comedy duo in the radio days and has NOTHING to do with the band.
3,wolverine mask,This mask seems durable. It runs a little large and seems big. Overall it is nice if you are a wolverine fan.
2,Highly overrated,"I had heard nothing but rave reviews about the Horrorist, and had heard his über-hit ""One Night in NYC"", so I decided to check out the rest of his album. There were only about five songs that I could stand listening to more than once. Most of the beats are alright, and if this was a strictly instrumental album, I'd give it an extra two stars. What I think ruins it is Oliver's ""singing"". It is either a shrill screaming, à la Atari Teenage Riot, or it is in his storytelling style. The screaming songs are without a doubt terrible; ""Ich habe die Macht"" is by far the worst. His storytelling songs are much better, but lack replayability. Once you've heard ""One Night in NYC"" several times, I found it getting old.The best tracks on here are ""It Goes Like This"", ""One Night in NYC"" and ""Mission Extasy"". Absolute worst, hands down, is ""Ich habe die Macht"". All in all, I was disappointed in Manic Panic, especially since it seems to be very highly regarded in many reviews I've read."
3,Overrated,"In The Court Of the Crimson King is without a doubt a landmark album that changed the course of progressive music, but in my opinion it does not live up to the five stars everyone so eagerly seems to want to give it. The only 5 star song in the album is perhaps track 5: The Court Of The Crimson King. 21st Century Schizoid Man and I Talk to the Wind are also decent songs but pale in comparison to Greg Lakes work in any of the Emerson Lake & Palmer albums. The major drawback is having to endure Moonchild, the longest song on the album, which is nothing more than a bunch of disjointed sounds with practically no musical relevance at all. Unless you're into the historical significance of the album I wouldn't waste my money on it. In it's place I recommend Emerson Lake & Palmer's Trilogy and Tarkus."
5,Great Boxset,Amazing clarity on the Steven Wilson remixes. This box presents the absolute ultimate to the old sound and includes several variations of all that's available for this release. Highly Recommended
5,Love Prog rock? then you must love it.,"I could not believe it that it is the first album of King Crimson. That time Prog rock was in its formation state and this album made the path. out of 5 songs 3 are my all time favourite. 21st century, epitaph and in the court of. In my point of view the Prg rock went to its max height with Thick As a Brick by Jethro Tull, but if there were no 'In the court of crimson king' it could have been too tough to reach that height.Listen to it. You will love it."
3,pretty listenable stuff,"King Crimson is a pretty interesting band for those who like unpredictable and diverse musical ideas. That's what the band does best.Even though I'm a fan of mellotrons and think they're the most beautiful thing put on record, I can't say this album excites me anymore. It was good at first, when I didn't know a whole lot about the band, but once I received Lizard, Islands, Red and eventually learned to appreciate Larks Tongues in Aspic, I hadn't had much of an urge to go back to this album.It's still a pretty good listen, and for those who want their King Crimson to focus on vocal melodies, you can't go wrong with this album. That's the albums strongest point."
4,Loved the cover,I had never heard of King Crimson until a friend mentioned them to me and said I had to buy the album even if it was only for the cover. This was 1971 when I was 15. It blew me away. I was always terrified by the opening track. Looking back it all seems a little pretentious but in 1971 it was way ahead of its time
5,Canoodling to a purpose,"I'm really replying to the review by Nick Karn. During their career, Crimson often made - and occasionally recorded - long jams. Some of these canoodle. They wander from place to place in a rather aimless way. The difference between this and minimalism is structure. Now, from the perspective of the '00's, we can understand just how forward looking that long jam was. A large quiet space with a few sounds dropped in it, to savor, to allow us to recover from intensity. New-age music has made us used to very quiet and spacious tracks. But many modern ambient pieces just seem to wander: whereas the best have structure, as those doodles that Fripp or Klaus Schultz chose to put on record have structure. In this..small tinkle of bells, this...single slow drumroll, are all the pent-up fury and power of a monumental band. That is why I love King Crimson."
4,The Most Important King Crimson Album,"In the Court of the Crimson King is one of the founding albums of the progressive rock genre. It is a staple in any cd collection specializing in classic rock. If you don't own this album, I urge to get it."
5,the best by far,the best Crimson ephitath is stunning. Fripp is outstanding but Greg lake has never been better in his vocal range. Better then his ELP RECORDINGS!
5,Still Ruling!,"King Crimson has been rock, progressive, alternative, whatever the label for many moons...and they still have a place today in our listening repertoire with great instrumentation and harmony."
4,a classic,"The first and last songs are awesome. Seriously some of the best music ever recorded. The songs in the middle aren't as good, but if you're really into prog rock you'd probably like them more than I do. Worth getting!"
5,??????,"Does anyone know the availability of this? I saw that it was advertised as a ""SACD"" release (noted in the ""Rolling Stone"" magazine 2003 year-end magazine's sacd advertisement). Is it out or is it being released? HELP!"
2,Only one good song,The title track is the only good song. The others are just mindless crap that drone on and on and have no value.
1,The 1960s weren't ALL great...,Music = Drug induced hippie acid tripping noise.Lyrics = Hippie dippy artsy fartsy pipers and fairies hogwash tripe.And that's putting it mildly.
3,not quite a king,"If King Crimson just layed off the experimentation of various sounds and stuck to talent, they would be incredible. ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" was destroyed by the screeching, psychedelic sounds that interrupt the flow of music. ""Moonchild"" was a great example of their potential. With a focus on the lyrics instead of showing off, the soothing sounds were enjoyable. ""In the Court of the Crimson King"" was a well orchestrated song creating a full, rich sound of warmth. Robert Fripp's talent pulled the music together but the band's collaboration made it what it was. As long as you skip through the first song and some of the variuos experimentations with sound, this is an enjoyable album. No one will be breaking down any doors to get it but it's good music that you could enjoy."
2,"Well it's fair, but depressing","I heard 2 songs from this album....the title cut, and 21st Century Schizoid Man. I Like ""21st Century Schizoid Man"". The title cut is terrible. It's like having a good cry to where you put yourself to sleep, and not wanting to wake up. The songs in between are ify at best. The 2nd and 3rd songs are just as bad as the title cut, and the 4th song is o.k. Mind you I sampled songs 2-4, so I didn't hear them in their entirety, but I really don't want to either."
1,Just Plain Bad,"King Crimson symbolises all that is bad about 70s 'rock.' It amounts to little more than pretentious little boys who have no understanding of rock and roll at all. The result is tedious, self indugent, crap posing as meaningful rock music. For your own sake buy The Velvet underground and Nico, White Light/White Heat, The Velvet Underground and Loaded and you will have four perfect examples of rock and roll. Once you have done this you will no doubt want to distroy all your King Crimson albums and deny ever having owned then or even having bothered to listen to them. Sad!"
5,In The Court Of The Crimson King,"Of course the opening track on this CD (21st Century Schizoid Man) is the most popular song on the album. It is one of the most amazing recordings, especially considering that it came out in 1969. These guys were using various distortion techniques and some truly insane instrumental work that was unlike anything else at the time. If the band never recorded another song, they probably would still be remembered for that revolutionary track. Even so, the album contains four other interesting songs that are all interesting as well. ""I Talk To The Wind"" is a lovely ballad that is completely unlike the other tracks on the album. I also like the title track that closes the album. As most critics have pointed out, the only shortcoming is when the band slips into some utterly aimless instrumental work in ""Moonchild"". It doesn't sound that good and it goes on way too long. Still, that isn't a reason to disregard this amazing piece of early progressive rock."
5,My Favorite King Crimson Album,"At the end of the 60's, most rock music had gone back to the basics with groups like The Band or Creedence Clearwater Revival. King Crimson was one of the first bands to explore progressive rock. Pink Floyd was evolving from their Syd Barrett period and they were still a few years away from their classic ""Dark Side of the Moon"". I don't think Greg Lake ever sang better, and it has one of the greatest album covers."
5,Magnificent!,"I can't fault this release. Such a great product. The only problem is that it is the 4th Amazon order out of the 6 that I have made in the last several years that has arrived damaged due to innapropriate packaging. Amazon requested I review this product and I urge you to buy it through a company with proper quality control. You'll enjoy it and be saved the hassle of return postage, emailing, waiting on refunds and whining."
5,"deviates strongly and powerfully from ""flower power"" of time","this is an album you either love or hate, and I happen to enjoy it a lot. It is an underrated classic of prog rock, a genre that has been despised over the years. The powerful opener is heavy metal before heavy metal existed, and the control of the arrangement and vocal distortion is just stunning. The rest of the album is mellower, but no less powerful. If you like Rush and Yes and similar bands, than you need this cd. Read the other great reviews for more detail."
4,crimson still king,enjoyed this just as much as when it first surfacedstill sounds modern even by todays standards
5,EPIC,"This album is truly brilliant from start to finish, but now do yourself a favour and listen to these guys.......... they have an album coming out soon[...]"
2,What happended to Ian McDonald?,"I am a big fan Of King Crimson. I have met Ian McDonald through my playing at the jam at BB Kings in NYC (I am a drummer.) I 've found Ian to be a very humble, modest musician and friend. When he told me he wasn't even consulted for this reissuse I was astonished. I really can't understand why the major orchestrater for this monumental piece of musical history was not contacted for it's reissue."
1,Lame attempt at art rock,"Wow, this is probably the lamest album I've ever heard. I was shopping around FYE, looking for the deluxe edition of St. Anger and a Carlos Mencia DVD and this caught my eye because the cover was weird. So since it was like $4.99 I bought it because it was a good deal and ""influential"". Gee whiz it was bad! King Crimson are lame Creed ripoffs who try to make ""art rock"". Hey King Crimson, leave art rock to the masters like Nickelback and Staind."
3,Masterpiece?,"I know this is suposed to be a masterpiece and probably was groundbreaking at the time, but I am not digging it. I'm a fan of a lot of music from well before my time but I just can't get album. Maybe I'll try again but I just think it is dated."
5,1969 - the greatest music,"I have always hated vinyl for obvious reasons. I framed the entire album cover and it hangs. The CD reminds me of great and interesting time to be on the planet. Its true that ""Moon Child"" is a little long (meant to be trippy/meditative). Thank God this music did not go away. The UPC bars mar the beauty of the watercolor - but commercialism has not yet gone away. Soon? Please spend the extra money for a sheet of paper to place the serial/purchasing info. so it can be tossed. My IPOD library is complete with this CD."
4,It's been along time,"I hadn't heard it in a very long time. It's not played often on the air, but I caught a little bit of it watching ""Children of Men"". It's been put away in my collection and will be brought out occasionally. It brought some great memories flooding back how ever vague they may still be."
2,Japanese Bootleg ! Beware,"This disc is a Japanese bootleg, as a matter a fact all the live shows are japanese boots that aren't worth the price! The sound quality should be crisp and clear especially for the amount they try to charge you for it. However this disc does have some good rare demos and rehearsal takes. The two best tracks are ""Am a do"" and ""Turn your lights down low""...still not worth the price, try searching for marley tapes via the web see what you find...all should avoid all Japanese bootlegs that are not paying royalties to the Marley estate......JAH Ras Tafari !"
3,"""A poor come back from the pioneers of the movement"".","This compilation features the cream of the crop of the True-Skool Hip-Hop generation. It's a pity that they chose to want to make a come back on some current Hip-Hop b.s. Two tracks on this CD are called ""REAL"" and ""KEEP IT REAL"". Two songs with the same name and topic that a thousand other rappers used in the early 90's. The only dope songs are the ones by the Furious 5, but their not icredible songs either. But their all right. Nothing classic on this CD, but many wack songs from pioneering giants. A sad day for the True-Skool."
2,Great Pictures When It Works,"This camera takes very good pictures and has a great concept for storage that is by far cheaper per picture than most digital cameras, but it is UNRELIABLE.My camera has been broken with the same issue THREE TIMES in one year. The issue is a bad power module. Sony Customer NO Service was not helpful in resolving this issue the first time after I had the camera for 1 week. It took them 6 weeks to return the camera, eating up the 90 day labor warranty and causing me to have to purchase the extended warranty so I would not have exorbitant labor charges if it needed to be fixed again.Do not purchase this camera if you want to be sure to get pictures at those important times in life. If you do, please have another camera on standby so you have another way of capturing the moments."
2,The worst watch I ever bought,"I was so exited when I recieved the watch 2 weeks ago but, and then I opened the box, the watch looked really nice as I expected but it didn't work so I have to return it the next day. I am still waiting for my refund."
1,PATHETIC JUNK!,This is a real stinker. The only good thing about this lousy movie is great acting by Gregory Peck. If you must see this disaster then rent it.
1,This does not work for tendonitis.,"The folks who use this item does not have tendonitis. It is no more help than wear a pair of underware on my hands. The other splints I have worn are so cumbersome, I thought these would be more comfortable. More comfortable, but no support and no help for my thumbs."
3,DONNY OSMOND???,"I don't own this album, but having come to age in the '80s, I am quite familiar with every song on it... except for that one by Donny Osmond.Somehow it just seems SOOOOO WRONG that he is in the midst of Richard Marx, Pat Benatar, Poison, Great White, et al...DONNY OSMOND???"
4,"Almost gave 3 stars, til I finally listened thru headphones!","Until recently, the only Eno in my catalog had been ""Thursday Afternoon"", which I love. The many positive reviews for ""Another Green World"" posted on this website and several others convinced me that I should buy it without need of sampling it. Now, good albums always seem to require patient listening before they shine in all their glory, but AGW was off to a slow start with me, and I didn't seem to be enjoying it much more with repeated litening. Trouble was, I was listening at low/mid volumes in my living room while helping take care of two kids (including a newborn) and other distractions abounding. Then I brought it to work and plugged in the headphones. A-HA! I had been missing nearly all the subtleties, and this entire CD is filled with beauty and color that I would call ""subtle"", or at least restrained. It's meditative without being either flashy or boring. A solid 4-stars..."
4,"A long, melodic day","No other artist has come as close to doing an album such as Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon other than Eno. A series of brief instrumentals, strange and beautiful, all flow together to describe the course of one day. Eno can't sing, but does anyway and sounds strangely good on all of 5 tracks. The result is a series of musical landscapes which spread out for the listener to enjoy."
5,Eno's Pop Peak,"This album comes from around the same period as ""Discrete Music"", where Eno discovered the idea of music as acoustical 'coloring'. And this work contains some of the 'coloring' ideas that no doubt came from that critically-important work. A contemplative sense can be found all over this album, an almost brooding feeling, even. There aren't a lot of 'songs' here, although when the lyrics do appear, they often seem present just as much for their sonic usefulness as perhaps for their content. And as far as that sonic content goes, Eno and his ensemble of players shift gears seamlessly between pure atmospherics, weird noise-pop, bits of classicism, sci-fi glam, faux-ethnicisms and jazz bits, and so on. None of this really 'rocks', but that's the point; if it did, it would be so much less of a cohesive, coherent work than the sci-near-fi soundtrack (or film scenario?) that resulted. One of the few mid-70s things I can think of, also, that hardly sounds dated. Strongly recommended."
2,I don't get it!,"I know that people will strongly disagree with this review. I also know that this is historically a landmark album. I just think it's so boring!The instrumental pieces have nothing going on, no strong melodies... for the most part they are just noise.The song ""St Elmo's Fire"" is the only tune with a little substance but other songs with vocals like ""I'll come running"", ""Golden Hours"" and ""Everything merges with the night"" range from unremarkable to down right boring.Maybe when this was produced these tunes were innovative. You definitely hear the precursors of future electronic effects. Today, I find this cd to be very boring and not worthy of repeated listenings."
5,One of Eno's Best,"Not as good as TAKING TIGER MOUNTAIN, but why quibble? It's still better than most of what's out there, from the period in which it was released to today."
5,one of the best progressive rock albums of the seventies,this is brian eno's best album to my opinion. it is a progressive rock album; but first signs of the ambient music he created later are already there. the impressive line up includes robert fripp and phil collins.
4,"""A Woman's Life Is Like A Threadless Kite"" ~ The Sacred And Profane Nature Within The Indian Brothel","Note: Hindi with English subtitles.Long before `Memoirs of a Geisha' gave the Western World a glimpse into the exotic life of the Japanese courtesan in '05, the Indian film industry opened the doors of the courtyard and allowed us to step into the inner sanctum of an urban brothel in the insightful '83 film `Mandi.' Boasting a superior cast containing some of India's best; Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil, Saeed Jaafrey, Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri, this is surely a film worth viewing.The acting is excellent, the camera work and sets superior and the music alluring. If that isn't enough to keep your attention for 163 minutes just set your gaze on the enchanting Shabana Azmi or the lovely Smita Patil. If you enjoy Indian films and what to go a little deeper into the culture than what's usually provided in most recent Bollywood films this one is definitely for you."
4,Great movie on disappearing world of courtesans,"This is the first film I've seen from Shyam Benegal and I am adding him to my list of great Indian filmmakers now, alongside though below Satyajit Ray (but I have yet to see his other films). Anyway, I loved that movie and I encourage all to see it. It also contains a few gems, like ubergorgeous Neena Gupta singing ghazal ""shamashiir barahanaa maa.Ng Gazab"" (written by the last moghul of India, Bahadur Shah Zafar) while dancing gracefully and oh-so seductively in the enchanting Kathak style. Aaaaah, I'm in heaven..."
2,Not that great,Had seen the movie based on this book and loved the movie. Figured I'd love the book and read more that needed to be left out of the movie. I was very disappointed to see there were a ton of discrepencies between the two. Peter Maas really portrayed all involved very poorly!
3,I Have 1 Problem With This Book,"The book as a whole was pretty good, but I do have one major problem with this book. There were some instances where the book stated that Kenneth Taylor had probably faced some kind of sexual abuse in his past, and then at the very end of the book it quotes his mother as saying that she had heard that some mothers performed fellatio on their infant children to ease teething pain.To me this made it seem like the author was trying to imply that perhaps Kenneth's mother had been the one to sexually abuse him. Maybe I am just super-sensitive, but that's the way I took it and I was somewhat offended by it."
2,POSSIBLE BUYER BEWARE!,"While this group of films fits more in the theme than the last group (COPS AND ROBBERS), I would caution people before buying it. On a previous volume, the short HIGHER THAN A KITE was included. The print quality was terrible and grainy yet when this film pops up on AMC, the quality is pristine. Those of you who purchased that DVD, check out HTAK next time it plays AMC and you'll see what I mean. In addition, the previous volume that had THREE LITTLE BEERS on it was cut. Obviously nobody is taking the time to make sure these films are restored properly....I cannot recommend enough that people do not spend their hard earned money on any of these Stooge volumes. In many cases, the picture quality on the older VHS editions is superior..."
2,Contains Very Weak Shorts.,"I am a very big stooge fan. Therefore, I have seen every short, especially the Curly ones. The shorts contained in this collection are:1) Boobs In Arms (1940)2) Back From The Front (1943)3) G.I. Wanna Home (1946)4) Wee Wee Monsieur (1938)5) No Dough Boys (1944)6) Dizzy Pilots (1943)In my opinion, ""Back From The Front"", ""Wee Wee Monsieur"", and ""No Dough Boys"" are weak shorts. And another thing, when you see the cover of this DVD, you will notice a typo. The title is ""G.I. Wanna Home"", NOT ""G.I. Wanna Go Home"". There is no ""Go"" in the title. That is such a common error. I don't understand why it is that diificult to get a simple title right."
3,"Hey Columbia, Do You See What Everyone Else is Doing?","OK, every other DVD compilation is made up of entire seasons, so why can`t Columbia release the Stooge shorts by year & in release date order? Would it really be that difficult to do? Of course not. Columbia is just out to rake in as much money as possible. They don`t care what the quality of the product is. The VHS tapes shouldn`t look better than the DVD."
4,Must-have Eno,"This is more ""essential"" Eno, imho. From the truly pop-oriented brilliant round-like ""Backwater"" to the intensity of ""King's Lead Hat"", Eno adds great music throughout - some somber, some slightly eclectic, some dreamy, lots of interesting music on this album. Great addition to any Eno collection, and a solid example of his work. I started with the album way back when, then the CD... and now of course I'll have to purchase the remastered version."
5,"MUST HAVE,,GREAT SOUNDS","In 1977 this is the one that introduced me to Eno and my view of ""what music is"" was changed forever. A clasic that still sounds new to anyone who has never listened to it previously."
5,Essential one-of-a-kind thing,"This album is key. KEY. Seriously though, it's my favorite Eno album, unique among his own stuff (he called this one ""funk"") and unique among everything.Funk though... (thinking of one of the bass lines) okay, funk on a series of very lonely planets ""drifting at the edge of time"" with spiders for company, where that bass player drifts into a wild atonal solo only to be quickly called back to underpin the cowbell interlude.This is the one with the ad for prints of Peter Schmidt paintings and Oblique Strategies card decks.This is the one where all the titles are supposed to be anagrams (at least ""King's Lead Hat"" is) of Eno-related people and things."
1,Elmocize,"I was not at all impressed with Elmocize. My girls love Elmo, but were not in the least bit interested in this DVD. It does not get them to move around at all. I did, though, find a children's DVD that does get my girls to move- Tots Rock by joue joue. We watch it all the time"
2,One of the worse ones,"Apparently they hired their singers off the street without hearing them as they are terrible. No surprise in that Cyndi Lauper is horrible, she always was. My 1 1/2 year old will sit and watch it sometimes but she seems to find this one boring as well. It gets a 2 instead of a 1 as it has Elmo and my daughter will watch it sometimes, but other elmo videos you couldn't pull her away from. There are certainly videos out there more deserving of your money. Bleggh!"
3,"Worth adding to your Sesame Street ""rotation""","Ok, so I got this one because of the title. Anything ""Elmo"" will probably end up in our home. It's not my favorite, but, of course, I bought it for my daughter, now 17 months. She enjoys it simply because Elmo is in it, and she loves his voice. However, in the segments when Elmo isn't involved, she does tend to lose interest. As a teacher who is married to a former special ed. bus driver, I agree it's important to include children with a wide range of abilities; unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, Workout in a Chair is pretty bad in a ""grate on your nerves"" sort of way. We don't watch this one often, but it makes a good filler when we've seen our other videos too much in the last week.Not the best Elmo video, but if you're like me, and need to rotate your videos for your own sanity, go ahead and add it to your collection."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this DVD for my three year old who is in love with Elmo. I thought that it would be a sort of excercise video that would have the kids dancing around and moving instead of just watching another Elmo video, that way she gets to see Elmo but she is not just sitting in front of the TV. However, while the characters do dance sometimes, they stand around and talk about excercising more than actually doing anything. Essentially, the kids are just sitting watching another video."
4,Elmocize,"This is a good video to get you up and moving. It even has a chair exercise for those who aren't able to get up and move. After each segment there is a rest time with dialogue between Elmo and a Muppet news announcer. It encourages children to move and use their imagination to move. If you were looking for particular exercise moves that really is only in the chair exercise segment. The children I purchased it for enjoyed the airplane segment, however, the first time we watched it they just wanted to see what it was about. Second viewing they got up and moved"
3,"Not great, but my kid likes it","My son started to like this when he was just about 3; younger than that and he had no interest. He loves to follow the fairly unstructured routines and jump around with the Elmocizers.I'm pretty disappointed with it, though. I wanted something we could do together, but the little workouts don't do much for me. Also, the music is awful. Even though she's a peppy critter, the ""Workout in a Chair"" lady couldn't find the key to her tune for love or money. Cyndi Lauper also belts out more than her share of clinkers, and seems somehow remote from the proceedings. The tunes themselves are nowhere near the usual Sesame Street standard."
1,"Ugh...horrible music, horrible video!","Eventhough my 21 month old daughter loves this video, I cannot stand it. Not only are some of the tunes incredibly REPETITIVE, but the song with Cyndi Lauper is dreadful. I am not impressed with this video at all, and I hope my daughter grows out of it pretty quick!"
3,Not the Best Elmo Video,"My son just adores Elmo, so I got this video because it would have lots of Elmo in it. But, it doesn't grab his attention that much.I recommend The Best of Elmo for kids that want songs and lots and lots of Elmo."
2,"Fun to watch, but not to get fit!","I bought this video expecting it to help my 4 year old exercise more, but it it more of an entertaining video ABOUT exercise. The songs are designed to get children moving but the breaks between songs are too long, so the momentum is broken. My daughter who is great at following directions, had a hard time following it. She likes to do things ""the right way,"" but the children are frequently all doing different things(rather than moving in unison)...so she gives up and just watches. It is okay, but I'd say there are better Sesame Street videos out there for your $$. This one tries to be both entertaining and good for exercise, but it meets neither goal very well."
1,Terrible Elmo DVD and terrible exercise video!,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this Elmo DVD. My son absolutely loves Elmo, so I purchased this to add to his vast Elmo DVD collection and get him to have fun while learning to exercise. This is the absolutely WORST Elmo DVD! It does nothing to get kids moving, it is only 30 min and, while I am a fan of Cyndi Lauper (her 80s music), she was terrible. Do not waste your money on this one. I only have it one star because I don't think there's an option for ""no stars."" Happy Healthy Monsters is a better DVD to get the kids moving and has plenty of Elmo in it for my little Elmo maniac!"
3,Usually works pretty well...,"but sometimes the camera won't turn on. It has a little door that covers the lens. Once in a while, after turning on the camera, the little lens cover doesn't open correctly. Often it takes several tries to get the camera to turn on properly.Aside from this irritation, the camera works great. It takes great pictures."
5,"Simply Super, easy-to-use","I'm a camera and cell-phone maniac to begin with and this product has satisfied our needs impeccably. The film quality is quite good outdoors though the indoor quality isn't marvellous. I didn't buy the dock and I find it quite easy to transfer with the USB cable. The picture quality is exceptional. Indoor and outdoor pictures, you get far more than you expect. And talking about safety my camera easily survived a 2 foot fall 1 and a half weeks after it was brought and the batteries just came out, thats all. The zoom is not enough to be precise, but o.k. I have'nt experienced the battery problem that many users are talking about and I am quite happy without the charger(mind you, I'm on my 1st set of batteries.) though I off the camera whenever I finish using it. This camera is marvellous."
2,Kodak DX3600,"This is a nice camera with very good features for the price, however there seems to be a very long delay in the picture taking process. If the subject is moving at any speed at all, it usually is out of the view finder by the time the picture is recorded, unless you try and follow it like a video cam. Another problem has been the on/off switch. At least 50% of the time the camera will not turn on, and on some occasions turns off before the timer feature is activated and will not turn on again. This appears to be a fault with this unit and not a funtion of the camera in general. I have read others have had the same problem, which leads to a suspect quality control issue with Kodak. I will return this camera and try another unit, because I do like the features, however the long term sevice contract may be something to consider for the Kodaks at the time of purchase."
1,Save yourself the trouble,"Kodak put all of their emphasis on the Easy Share software and none of it on the camera itself. I bought 17 of these cameras for use on a scientific project. After two weeks, 6 of them had to be returned to the vendor with non-functional lens motors. I'm sure it won't be long until the other 11 break. This camera is cheaply built with substandard parts. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA."
4,Excellent Quality for 2.2 meg. but battery life bad.,"This camera surprisingly prints great quality pictures in 3x5 to 5x7 sizes. The only problem I have with this camera is the rechargeable battery life is poor. The camera dock and the rapid charger does not adequately charge the batteries and I own 3 batteries and have a problem with all of them. I own the Kodak DX6490 now and do not have a problem with the battery keeping charged, so I believe they fixed this problem with later models."
1,Poor design,"I bought this camera recently and added also bought a padded carrying case for it. During a football game, I returned it to its case, latched the cover, and set it on the seat beside me. I stood up, and brushed it off the bench; it fell approximately 18 inches - in a padded case. This short and padded fall broke the camera! Kodak refuses to repair what appears to me to be a very fragile product. If you buy this product, treat it like an fresh egg (or a rotten egg as far as I am concerned. So much for buying American.)"
1,Not happy with Kodak,"I have a different model Kodak camera, however they all use the same EasyShare software. Running Windows XP, I could not get the software to work properly. After several hours on the phone with Kodak tech support, they couldn't get it working either. They said they are aware of the problem. It is now several weeks later and they still don't have a fix. They don't really seem to care either.It might not be a bad idea to consider other brands, instead of Kodak. Since, if the software won't work properly, then what good is the camera?"
1,Big letdown so far.,"The day I got this camera I tried taking some pictures indoors and noticed the flash was not working. I called the Kodak company, and they walked me through some procedures to make sure I was operating it correctly. Needless to say, the flash does not work and I am sending it back to Amazon.com for another one. I just hope this doesn't happen again or else I will never buy another Kodak camera again. Kodak said I could send it in for repair.....yeah right, no way! I paid for a new one that works, and that's what I'll get."
1,junk,"this camera looks good online, but it is made of cheap plastic. The lens has trouble sometimes so pictures have to be retaken. I DO not recommend this camera to anyone!"
2,"Slow response, okay for point and shoot and in bright light","This camera has a very annoying problem- when you push the button to take the picture there is about a half second delay before the picture is actually taken. This is really NOT good if you are hoping to take pictures of kids, candid photos or pictures of anything in motion. Other cameras are less expensive and don't have this horrible problem.Aside from this problem, if the picture is taken in bright light and at close range, the colors look wonderful."
2,Not Kodak Quality,"After one year of use, our camera acts very finicky about taking pictures. About 50% of the time the camera will not turn on, but will give the ""battery low"" red light--even though it has been sitting on the charging dock. After repeatedly switching on and off, it will usually turn on, but by then the photo op is usually lost. Also, although the pictures are easy to send over the internet, they do not print out well at the receiver's end."
3,"Good Camera, battery pack problems","Excellent picture, with great features and user-friendly software. I have had to return the camera several times due to problems with battery back and docking station. Because this was one of the first models with the docking station, I recommend buying a later model DX3700, 3900, 4900, etc. Hopefully they have worked out the kinks."
2,Camera is great when it works..On/Off does not function well,"This camera would rate a 5 when in working condition. The pictures are clear and it is very easy to use. However, I had to return the camera 2 times for having the same on/off switch problem (I will be buying a different model after the 2nd return)...Problem is that it does not consistantly turn on when you turn on the on/off shutter..A red blinking light comes on and the camera does not turn on....I'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem..."
5,The best yet!,"I'm 11 going on 12. I have had much experience with cameras, especially Nikons. I take pictures for a local skate park, so I do know what I'm doing. Anyway, so I'm opening my presents on Christmas morning, and I get to the Digital Camera. I decide to test it without even looking at the instruction manual! It was so easy to use and the picture quality is amazing! It's picture quality is as good, possibly better, than the heavy duty Nikons I'm used to working with. The KODAK DX3600 has a darn good zoom on it too and it captures every single moment. It stores up to 50 pictures on its Internal Memory alone! It's wonderful. And the amazing part is that I never had to read the instruction manual to learn how to turn it on/off. I recommend this camera to everyone from novices to experts! Take my advice, get this camera!"
3,Great looking pictures/movies....sometimes.,"I really really want to like this camera! I started off with the Dx3500 and then I found out Kodak released an updated version of the same camera, I traded my Dx3500 in for the Dx3600 model. They both are pretty much the same except the Dx3600 has a 2x optical zoom and can make movies complete with audio. As long as you dont use the 2x optical zoom, your pictures come out very nice. It is when you start zooming in is where you run into problems. Every picture that I have ever taken with the zoom has been out of focus. The movie mode is picky. Sometimes it gives you a nice clean movie, other times it is out of focus as well. If all you need are nice pictures, I would stick with the Dx3500. The Dx3600 is just way to picky! If anyone has any better luck with this camera, I would love to hear about it!...."
4,CHECK FOR PRODUCT MATCH,NICE PRODUCTCOULD NOT MATCH CONNECTORS WITH MY OLDER COMPUTERI COULD USE MORE TECH TRAININGIT IS NOW ON A SHELF
2,Dvd players/Laptops have trouble finding chapters and playing first couple disks,Bought this a while back and just getting around to watching the series again. My laptop and DvD player have trouble running the first 1/3 of the season. Sometimes the dvd player and or the laptop will scan and scan (the laser moves back and forth so much it sounds like a printer) till it eventually will just fail to play. Will be buying a different vendors set
3,War is hell,forgot that this was all about that. still a classic though. But its all about the gundams so thats why i like
4,Don't get this confused with 0079,"Many gundam purists will dismiss the alternate continuities, and this is a shame, because as they go, Wing is actually pretty good. It is miles better than G-Gundam, and I would say even better than 0080 (UC continuity). The characters can be a bit weak at times, but they work well as a cast. If you want a good action anime with great mech design, you could do worse than Gundam Wing."
2,"Great series, not so great set.","I got this (along with collection 2) for Christmas, and most of the DVD's didn't work (in multiple players). So I had them both replaced, only to realize that I had the same problem with the replacements. I don't know if Amazon recieved a bad batch from the company or what, but I'm going to try and find another set.As for Gundam Wing itself, it doesn't get much better as far as animated series go."
4,Not the best gundam out there but ...,Its good enough with awsome ms action that all gundam fans love its good. But theres a bad side to it the final fight scene was to close to Chars Counter Attack its not even funny. And sometimes the battles could of been aviod. But what keeps this series up is its Charactor building . Like Heero becoming a nice guy and Quatre becaing less gay its. All in all if u like gundam get it but if u just stared watching pick up Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory.
5,awsome show.,"this gundam is just plain awsome, any gundam fan should get it immediantly as it's awsome and well done and the story is neat too."
2,Bad Collection,"While Gundam Wing is one of my favorite anime's, this collection is horrible. I had to order it a total of 3 times due to scratches on many of the discs. Because of these scratches, many of the episodes would freeze and skip. Overall, while Gundam Wing is a great classic anime, this collection was very poorly made and I suggest that anyone looking to own the series should wait until a different set becomes available."
3,if you like gundam wing then u should read this,"i love the cartoon reminds me when i use too watch it a long time ago but some of the cd's mess up when you put them in the dvd player,The dvd starts to make a shaking sound but some of the other cd's from the set are ok they dont make that shaking sound .other wise one of my favorite cartoons gotta get one of these collections!"
3,GOOD AND BAD AT THE SAME TIME,"this is a really good,no, great seires,but it also spelled doom for the gundam name and ruined its originality and creadibility.in defense of gundam wing, it has a masterful well laid out story line and it is one of the best gundams shows made, but this is also what made gundam commercial, a household name, gundam lost its cult status after this and all of its originality. basically every gundam after this became a rehash of fancy pretty boy main characters and overblown, overbudget animation where looks and animation where more important then story or characters. the biggest offender of this is gundam seed, its basical another 0079 regurgitation whith brainless pretty boy main characters. this is the last real gundam seires in my opinion, before the series catered to american audience whith pretty boy main characters and a overblown half hour toy commercial, and just told an epic story."
1,10 Disk set is DEFECTIVE!,"Twice I've received this, ordered as a gift for my son. In both cases the set was defective. Disk one had the identical problem. Episode 3 appeared to be mis-recorded and repeated segments, and episodes 4 & 5 were unwatchable. This 10 disk set is definitely defective! The identical defects appeared in both sets. Thanks, I hope someone takes care of this."
5,Gundam Wing-Can't get enough,"Okay, I got this set for Christmas, and man, I love it. I was greatly saddened when Gundam Wing was removed from Toonami's Programing. This was the first anime series that I really enjoyed, and I still hadn't seen all the episodes. Well, I have finished them all, and I am very pleased.Lacking the silly faces of Tenchi or Trigun, and not as outrageously ""extreme"" as Dragon Ball Z, it has a very serious animation style. No pink hair here! And the plot takes place in a future without alien invasions and hyperdrives, which is refreshing to me.The character developement is interesting, with a wide cast of characters, each with their own feelings and motivations. The plot flows quite well, and the characterization is such that all the characters' actions are believable. While it does have some flaws, I couldn't in good consciene lower the score. I loved watching it."
2,Series average - Manufacturing quality terrible,"I give the series a three start rating, but only one star to this specific box set. I've never had so many defective discs in a single box. They seem to be warped, and when stuck in a player that spins up to a decent speed, they start vibrating like crazy. In by box, discs 1, 2, and 5 all share the issue, with 2 being so bad my main DVD player connected to my TV refused to play it. Only my 5.5 year old PowerBook with a low speed DVD-ROM was able to play it.I found similar problems with the second set of Gundam Wing as well."
2,"Awesome Series, DVD Set No Good!","While the series itself is great this set isn't! Bandai as of lately has decided to repackage the shows in cheaply made cases, and cheap disc art for the DVDs... I have the first 4 volumes of Gundam Wing... All were in good cases and the disc art had a foil effect... For this set the disc art has a faded look and plain looking... The case is horrible... The first tab that holds dvd 1 in the tray has come apart... Resulting in me having to glue and tape it together again... Same goes for the tab that holds dvd 5 it's now coming loose... Sloopy job... And it's worth the $40.00 price now...Take my advice get the series in the separate volumes!"
1,Bad Customer Service,I received the item and one disc was broken then I emailed a complaint they only responded to say we got your response about a week later
4,Brings back Memories of a Great Anim'e,"A very intense, Productive, and realistic Anime.Politics, War and of course, GUNDAMs to shine the light, and ones who shed darkness.You can't Really go Wrong with this set.No Extras Though.Overall, This anime is more story oriented than action.You are NOT a fan of ANIME or quality programming unless you seeMOBILE SUIT GUNDAM WING"
2,Not worth it,"The original Gundam TV series, not the movies, with Amuro Rei, Char Aznable and Lala Sun was a serious drama of troubled adolescents forced to join a cruel war robbing them of their innocence. It was done with realistic characterization and personalities. Even the mecha tried to be realistic. Then Gundam turned super mecha with cool but irrational robot coloring and designs, and worse yet, included poser personality-type heros (perhaps with the exception of ""War in the Pocket""). That's all fine and good if there is some entertainment value, but even Gundam Seed does a better job than Gundam Wing. Perhaps the only thing worth it in this series is Endless Waltz, but that doesn't make up for much. Shop around and there's better to be had in the Gundam universe."
2,With all the hype about MS Gundam Wing...,"Gundam Wing didn't do much for me. The storyline is as slow-paced, and the action sequences didn't impressed me as well.There wasn't any character build up throughout the series, they are more like a tool to me compare to the Macross Trilogy or to Neo Genesis Evangelion. I enjoy the air-to-air combat on Macross as well as the one-on-one barbaric fights on Evangelion."
2,Watch Real Gundam for Crying out Loud!,"I'm a Gundam fan, okay, I'm a Gundam junkie. I collect models, build them, I own every DVD, my room is decorated with wall scrolls... you get the picture. So I was obviously very eager to get my hands on this, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT ...^_^)Okay, this game has decent animation. It did however, come out in year 1995-1996 so I was sort of expecting that. The characters [are weak], the storyline is [also weak], Zechs is an [imitation] of Char, the whole thing's just bad. Do NOT waste your money on this (Altron Custom however is great, but in the OVA series Endless Waltz). If you are a hardcore gundam fan however, it looks good on your shelf.Oh, but it has a good soundtrack, worth purchasing soundtrack. Only Operation 1 however is worth it.Only buy this if you are1. A person who likes to see heros who always win2. a person who knows nothing about Gundam3. if you're a collector4. If you want to see if I'm speaking true."
3,IT'S GOOD AND APPEALING IN MANY WAYS,"This is the first gundam series I saw and I personally liked it. Wars are mostly political problems with the use of force to basically force your opinion as a truth. The reason why I gave this series a 3 star rather than anything higher is because some factors in the series were a bit way too out there. The idea that just 1 machines can easily take out over 50, is just pushing it to me. As well as 5 young teenager being just super soldiers at such a young age. At least in Gundam Seed & Seed Destiny you got teenagers who are genetically superior to the point where they have the capabilities of an adult. Either way, I think it's still a good animation just too pricy if you ask me."
1,"Too unrealistic, and doesn't stack up.","It is true that North Americans do not get enough good Anime. Most people know anime as Pokemon, Yu Gi Oh, and things like that. Needless to say, Anime does not have a very good reputation in North America. Gundam Wing is better than Pokemon, but that's where it stops.As soon as I saw it, I saw a problem. Five invincible super-gundams. No matter how badly outnumbered, they would always win. Character development is minimal, and the main character is the most annoying character in the history of anime.With the release of Gundam SEED Coming up, I see no reason ANYONE should buy this. SEED is a far greater series than Wing."
5,Lucky I guess for one of the BEST Gundam Series' ever MADE,"Apparently I got lucky when I bought this set at Best-Buy when it first hit shelves. I have never had any problems, I was even watching it 20 minutes ago and it still works great. This show is probably one of the best gundam shows created, the REAL legend of the whole franchise, you have never seen a real gundam series' until you watch Wing."
2,Good series not so good dvds,"I bought this collection recently and so far its played all the episodes up to episode 18-20 basicly last 3 episodes on disc 4. The funny thing is i was watching this on my xbox 360 and it played fine, i tried watching it on a regular dvd player and it wouldnt even read the disc, i then tried to play it on my dvd player in my computer and again wouldnt even read the disc. Hopefully i can buy operation 4 by itself and just watch the missing episodes."
3,Set good but not great,"forgot how fun this one was. gundam wing is one of the shows that got me into anime so highly recommended. the set itself, likes others have said, has no extras to speak of. the disks all worked though."
2,Not very practical,"If you are looking for a book about 'debating' or 'logical argumentation', then MAYBE, this is the book for you. In general, the book goes ad nauseum into the author's past debates.Often, the author makes a great effort into explaining some concept with debating situation examples and then closes off the chapter with a comment like ""and this can also be applied to everyday arguments etc"". I became quite frustrated reading this book and found others with much more praticality.The author doesn't seem to understand that in reality, most arguements are not carefully planned debates but often arise from 'emotions' and cannot be easily won through 'logic' alone."
4,"Kaiser Bakeware Mini Springform Pans, Set of 4",These worked great but I was disappointed that the outer ring had rust spots after one washing in the dishwasher.
3,Coating peels... Just for once-in-a-while use!,"Great size and they make a 10oz. cheesecake. Easy release tabs, but you should flash freeze your cakes after time in the fridge. They'll release easy when frozen.HOWEVER, there is a 1"" strip of non-stick coating all around the entire inside length of the pan. I am now at 40 of 42 pans that the coating has COMPLETELY stripped off. Do you know what a cheesecake with non-stick coating pieces on the sides tastes like? Like a health emergency.If you will use these from 2 - 6 times a year, they will ROCK for you. If you use them a few times a month, like I did, you'll get 6 months out of them, tops."
2,it leaks,it leaks. i have to clean my oven after the baking. i wish it could be made sealed. not recommend
1,Bad out of the box,"Ordered one of these in July to have as a backup, because toner seems to run out at the wrong time. Finally needed to install it today, and it prints smudges on the left and right sides of the paper, spaced about an inch apart all the way down the page. Seems like something is wrong on the roller. Won't buy this again. I thought I could trust Verbatim over some of the other lesser-known brands."
4,cool New Jack swing jam,talk about a feel good new jack swing jam that still hits home. R.Kelly and Public Announcement had a jam with this cut. R.Kelly was vocally riffing like nobody's business and he nailed it vocally. a feel good new jack swing jam that still is a cut. a summer jam on the sho nuff tip.
4,Hilarious Anime,"Jungle de Ikou is a very colorful and funny series. This particular video is filled with many jokes, some suggestive, therefore this anime is not directed towards younger viewers, rather it is directed at teens. Also, the subtitled version is much better than the dubbed, as you may know, dubbed anime is not always the best. The plot centers on a ten year old school girl named Natsumi, who is given a magical pendant by her achaeologist father. Whenever she does a certain dance with this pendant, she transforms Mii, the Flower Goddess. The proportions of Mii are what make this series so funny, notably her amazingly large chest. She is joined by Ongo; a mischevious child spirit, Ahamu; the old and decrepid God of Soil, and Rongo; who is the Goddess of Water. So in conclusion I suggest you watch the hilarious escapades of Mii and her compatriots."
3,"fun, but...","Most people, I know rave about this show, but several flaws come close to ruining it. The two male leads may be interesting in their own right, but they're really too similar to one another for either to stand out. Add to that the mildly racist characature of the African-American lead, and you've got a considerable problem.The female leads are fairly typical super-hero type characters, but although stereotypical, it's pulled off remarkably well. Slapstick humor is the main draw, but it gets just a little repetitive after awhile.Still, I shouldn't downplay the positive aspects. I really laughed a lot, and if you're willing to overlook a few flaws, the anime is pretty enjoyable. Plus, the DVD has good picture quality, and the extra features won't make you scream too much. If you have the option to rent then do it, but if you're looking to expand your anime library, you could do worse."
3,One of the weaker volumes,"Hitomi has surrendered to the fortune enhanced Naria and Eriya. The side effects of their treatment end their lives though. Afterwards, Van is summoned to meet his brother at the ruins of Fanelia. Folken has decided to join the alliance and fight along side Astoria and it's neighboring countries. However, it's hard to trust a man that has already abandoned his people and killed in the named of a madman.This volume is my least favorite. Nothing of consequence really happened. I definitely think that volumes 6 & 7 are the worst. The series as whole is great though. You can't miss any of it, or you'll be lost. Even though this is a slower moving section, you need to see it. It's worth every minute of it in the end."
4,Shoegazing Foundation,"Ride's ""Nowhere"" is quite possibly a couple steps behind My Bloody Valentine's legendary ""Loveless"" album. While it has all of the elements of the wonderful shoegazing genre, it lacks the compelling intrigue and mystique that bands such as MBV and Slowdive created from.Though ""Nowhere"" starts off brilliantly with one of the greatest wall-of-sound attacks ever recorded, it loses steam quickly through the middle of the album. Some are quite tame compared to ""Seagull,"" while some are a bit tedious and even boring. As a whole, however, ""Nowhere"" is a (insert generic shoegazing terms like ""shimmering,"" ""sonic"" and ""crashing"" here) ""ride"" through the classic shoegazing experience.In my pecking order, ""Nowhere"" is a lagging third behind Slowdive's ""Souvlaki"" and, of course, ""Loveless.""Note: Check out ""Souvlaki"" for a more sensual approach to this style of dreamy music."
4,Amazing,This is a highly recommendable album. Some of the songs are better than others but they're all at least listenable. Nowhere features several of Ride's best tracks ever.
4,A decent example of early 90's dream-pop,"I borrowed this from a friend several years ago and it didn't grab me on first listen. I recently bought it and again it wasn't something that took hold right away, except for ""Vapour Trail"" with it's pretty melody. But after a few more listens it does offer some rewarding moments like on ""Dreams Burn Down"", ""Here and Now"" and ""Paralysed"". So, all in all , a very good album but still, I think there are better bands in this genre like Lush, Slowdive, Swervedriver, Moose and Pale Saints."
3,"A nice ""Ride"".","I'm not going to say that this is the essential album of the genre, but it is one of the better ones. I think it takes a few listens to get into, and no particuliar songs really stand out, but as a whole it's very good. I like the cover art, because it really does reflect the sound of the band. In short, if you're into the ""shoegazing"" sound at all, you should enjoy this. It could be 4 stars."
4,Another sonic landscape straight out of Dreamland,"At first listen, this album seemed simply good to average in my mind. Then, I found myself listening to this disc unfailingly for three straight days as the rush of spacey guitars and foggy vocals slowly burned their way into my psyche. While the album begins with the fairly straight-ahead ""Seagull,"" the rest of the tunes shimmy into a cascade of entrancing sound that completely (if not subliminally) sneak into the listener's consciousness.The dream-like elements are all in place: dense, rapturous, guitars, strategically placed and often delicate drums, tight rhythmic pulses, and distant, angelic vocals. Hypnotic in every sense, tracks such as ""In a Different Place,"" and ""Vapour Trail"" wash over you like a cool blue wave. Do yourself a favor and take this ride."
5,A classic from end to end...,"Few times can you think of albums recorded as recently as fifteen years ago as classics, but Ride's ""Nowhere"", with its emblematic cover and its load of anthemic tracks, constitutes just that: a classic album, from end to end. Influenced by the likes of Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine, the album kicks in with the distortion-heavy ""Seagull"", leading into songs as huge as ""Dreams Burn Down"" and as deep as ""Paralysed"". The end result is an overload of shoegazing material that turned out to even influence Radiohead's very own Thom Yorke, who was a fan of the fan before he scored his later successes."
2,The only redeeming quantity are the nude scenes,There is an opening shower scene with one lover. And a closing bathtub scene with a third lover. The middle lover didn't get a nude scene. The nude scenes are the highlight (the only highlight) of this movie. The cinematography is good so a star for that and another for the leading lady's charms. You have to wonder if they made up the script as they went along. It is worse than mundane. I cannot believe anyone talking like these people do. I cannot believe these people work at a television show. There are scenes where she makes faces at a bus stop. I don't know why she dumped the shower guy. But the bathtub guy playing a horn along with nude Hannah playing her horn was worth the $1.17 I paid for a used copy. But don't waste your life watching the middle of this. How did it ever get into blockbuster?
2,Only so-so,"I read this book a couple years back and then completely forgot about it until i saw commercials for the new movie with reese witherspoon. i thought it looked familiar.like others review-writers, this book was an easy read. i think i finished it in an afternoon. The writing wasn't great, the story was alright, and the ending was not-so-surprising.but overall, it was tolerable and at some points even interesting.i'll say this in closing, the book was enjoyable enough that i'm looking forward to seeing the movie. but save your money, and borrow the book from a friend or a neighborhood library...it wasn't anything special."
1,If Only It Were Written Well,"The story's improbable premise had so much potential: The hero (Arthur) finds the very real looking ""ghost"" of a young woman (Lauren)who is actually across town in a coma. The doctors are ready to pull the plug and she asks Arthur's help in kidnapping her body so that she can stay alive.I purchased the book thinking that this might be another ""Ghost"" or ""What Dreams May Come."" It's not. The characters are flat; the dialogue is wooden; the story line approaches the absurd. (How many practicing architects do you know would be able to take an extended leave of absence whilst they (a) steal an ambulance and (b) con a hospital into releasing a patient who's been in a coma?)I give the book a star, because I believe it has potential to be a reasonably entertaining movie. It was as though the author had written the book with that thought in mind. Perhaps Spielberg can do something with it."
2,A Question of Title,"Patty Engelmann in Booklist says ""Levy has managed to make the improbable seem possible"".I disagree, being too grounded in reality,but Levy would be pleasedwith her review since an accurate translation of the title is ""What if It Were True?"""
1,If only it weren't true that I read this!,"Part one of the book was interesting but went way down hill after that. I found the personality of Lauren to be very annoying! The dialogue between the characters sounded as if they were reading off of cue cards and their reactions to their situation were so unrealistic, even for a ""fantasy"" type of story. I ended up skipping from chapter eight to the last page just to see how it ended. I was so disappointed that I found it hard to believe anyone enjoyed this book!"
3,Movie Deal,I don't find any mention of it here by name but the Reese Witherspoon movie Just Like Heaven was based on this book.
4,Fun reading,"I don't usually read this type of book but it looked interesting and so I picked it up. I loved it. It was a funny, lighthearted book that made you feel good. Not deep reading, just relaxing. I passed it on to my sister who loved it also. I read it a long time ago and now I see a movie is coming out. Can't wait to see it! Read the book and then see the movie,a fun kind of movie. Romance and humor."
1,"If only if it were mediocre, even","This book was so badly written that, if the author were in my critique group, we'd have insisted he take some remedial writing courses. There was nothing original here, and this plot has been done much better by many who've gone before. The only positive I could find in reading it was that it taught me to appreciate Nicholas Sparks' writing skills, which is something I never thought I would say."
4,Cute,This is a very cute book and quite a fast read.My only problem with this book was the fact that there was such a lack of character relationship development between Lauren & Arthur; their romance felt rushed.Other than that? It was a pleasure to read.
3,Sweet Dreams....,A valentine .........a fantasy.......a summer read...or on an airplane... pure escape......no classic but leaves a smile on your face.
1,wasted potential,"The idea behind this story is a good one. However it could have been so much more with a more accomplished author. The love between Lauren and Arthur is not believable. There's no foundation for the depth of commitment it would take to commit the crime and therefore run the risks that he did. The friendship between Paul and Arthur was not believable. Again, why would Paul take the risks he took. Relationships are not well built, dialogue is strained. Past memories are just thrown in to accomodate the next chapters. The tough cop ends his role out of character. So many things wrong that, with more planning, more thought, more devotion to character development, could have made and awesome trilogy."
2,Hope the Movie is Better Than The Book,I am an avid reader and I was really looking forward to this book because the story line looked cute. The book was written so that it was hard to relate to the characters. I liked the storyline but the writing was hard to endure. I am hoping the new movie coming out will be better than the book.
3,Paranormal love story,"Paranormal love story written by first time French author, Marc Levy. Story of a young female doctor who is involved in a car accident and ends up in a coma. Her ""spirit"" is discovered by Arthur in a cupboard in the flat that he has just rented from the girl's parents. He is the only person who can see and touch her. The story goes onto to show them falling in love and then Arthur has the task of preventing her life support machine being switched off. There is a twist to the ending and whether you find it a sad or happy ending depends on your interpretation.I liked the idea of this book but I felt that it could have been written better. However, not bad for a first time author.""Where are you?"" and ""Seven days to Eternity"" are his latest books but as of date have only found them in French."
4,"very good book, but is it too magical?","Basically this book is about a girl who got a bad accident and when her body's in a coma in the hospital, her spirit's dating a guy. Cool huh? And the story goes on about how much the guy wants to save her from dying and everythin'. Everybody knows that this book has an impossible stories. But if you just let urself get into it and enjoy the book, I guess its gonna be a perfect book for you! Cause this book has a magical plot. sometimes, however, when you get into the real world, ur gonna think its ridiculous. So i suggest this book to those people who actually can imagine things and drifted into the dreamworld!! Have fun on experimenting...."
4,"great story, okay writing","If the book were indeed written in french originally, I can understand why the writing seemed a little flat and akward, especially in the beginning. Sometimes the scenes jumped a little too much to make too much sense.But the plot was very good and there were a couple one liners that were very memorable. A story on the theme of ""living every moment"". The writing settles in after a few pages and I was hooked till the end.I think it'll make a great novel if someone like Jude Deveraeaux wrote it. The book needed to be a little longer and the characters a bit more developed."
2,Descent into sentimentality,"It's a good thing I had a supply of insulin on hand to counteract the saccherine of this book. I was willing to suspend disbelief - I knew from the blurb the nature of the story. The book started promisingly enough - I particularly liked how the hero's friend and partner made sure the hero saw a psychologist once he (the hero) had reported a ghost in his appartment. However, the ease with which the partner was persuaded to break the law (and break it seriously!) was scarely credible. But my main problem with the book is the descent into sentimentality in the second half of the book. What a disappointment from such a promising premise and beginning."
5,A wonderful experience,A wonderful story that completely envlops the reader. Hope we will soon see more from Marc Levy.
5,A BREATH OF FRESH AIR!,"This book is a wonderful change of pace from the usual storylines. It requires the reader to use some imagination in joining Arthur and Lauren in a love based on faith and trust, and belief in the spiritual side of life. It is a blend of humor and impending tragedy that is met with unfailing courage and a message of hope that miracles can, and do,sometimes occur.If you enjoy delving into the supernatural, and you want to get involved in a mood lifting type of book, pick this one up and experience the beauty of it!"
3,Fairy Tale With Little Conflict,"If you are in the mood for a fairy tale type love story with very little tension or conflict, then this novel is for you. It reminds me of Segal's ""Love Story"" except this novel goes the happy route. Like ""Love Story"" though, this novel is simple and digestible in one gulp. I can see it as a popular movie. I can't account for why this was such a huge success in France. Maybe they like pink cotton candy, like one gets at a carnival. That is what this novel most resembles."
2,Didn't sparkle,"I just finished this book, and though it may have been terribly innovative to the readers in Europe, it seemed like just another formulaic American romance novel to me. Formulaic, but without the sparkle of the best of the romance genre...Spencer, Phillips, Mittman, etc. The story didn't seem to make the unbelievable believable. The premise and the potential were the, but the characters never grabbed me, I knew the ending all along, so I wasn't terribly motivated to turn the pages. If it hadn't been so short, I'm not sure I would have finished it at all. However, the author has potential, and I would not discount further works by him."
4,hope and spiritualism in a time of unbelievers,"There are good books, bad books and original books. I have never read a book like this before. I do not read romance novels, nor did I think this was one, as another reviewer did. I believe in ghosts, and in the spirit, the soul. I intimately know life and death.Although not a romance novel, this book is about love. About sharing and compassion. About an obsession about life. And retreiving one's life. It is about death, and the fraility of humans.If you have a curious mind, if you are open to the different realities, if your soul soars, you may love this book, and you may cry. It is a walk I am glad I took."
1,WHEW! WHAT A STINKER!,"DON'T DIVE INTO THIS ONE - VERY SHALLOW. I bought this book from Amazon thinking the premise was a good one and I still think it is. This author just could not write - poor character development, cliches galore, unrealistic dialogue, etc., etc. Hollywood has a long way to go to salvage this one. I'm still wondering how this author? got a publisher for this trash. It's very seldom that I cannot find something good to say about a book, but this one is the exception - I just couldn't see any literary value to this book whatsoever."
3,Much better in French,"After reviewing this disappointing book for a small local magazine, I called the publisher and had them send me a copy in the original French. It was much better. Editors for the English version (employees of Pocket Books, I assume) had deleted dialogue, rearranged scenes and destroyed Marc Levy's surprise ending. I found the French version a very interesting, very beautifully written book. Unfortunately for those who only read English, reading the translated substitute is like eating Cheez-Wiz instead of Brie."
4,Cheerful bubbles,"An excellent one-night read for those not bothered by reality, this book contains a nice blend of emotion and laughs. Do not read if you want a serious book. Main characters were good (though the hero's mother seemed rather trite and unbelievable). Poeple really do go off on whims like this! A happy book after a hard day's work."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"This book had been on my ""to read"" list for a while, because I was intrigued with the concept. However, the book did not meet my expectations. It was obvious that English was not the writer's first language - his sometimes cumbersome word and phrase choices took me out of the fantasy. And I guess that's the bottom-line for me. This book requires the reader to suspend his/her disbelief a great deal. I can usually do this *very* easily, but wasn't able to with this book. Therefore, I never really ""bought"" the story."
2,Promising but disappointing,"I really liked the sound of this book, being a romantic myself. Boy meets ghost, boy falls in love with ghost, ghost nearly dies......you can guess the rest. But it failed to deliver, there were huge jumps that occured in their relationship without being explained which really annoyed me and huge events like Lauren (the ghost) being able to feel things are skimmed over. Sadly, could have been a lot better than it actually was. Although, still perfectly acceptable for a beach read."
1,Not sure I want to finish.,I really thought I would like the idea of this book. Getting through the first hundred pages has really been tough. I keep hoping it will get better. Someone wrote that it seems like it is a movie script for Meg Ryan and I can't help but agree. It does remind me of City of Angels but this is just plain silly. I keep thinking of I Dream of Jeannie or Bewitched. I will try to finish it. Hopefully I will be back to say that it was worth it.
2,It could be worse...,"Summary: An okay book that eases away a few hours. Although the story and writting is substantially better than Nicholas Sparks' ""Message in a Bottle"" it would still make a poor movie.Strengths: Moderately interesting storyline. Nice touches of San Francisco.Weaknesses: The writing is trite and uninspired. The relationship dynamics between Arthur and Lauren are largely superficial and left me wondering why they were so much in love. Many key details were incorrect, e.g. a 1961 Ford ""Woody"" station wagon? with a V-6? Woody's were made 10-20 years earlier and V-6's didn't appear in Ford until many years later, bringing into question the integrity of other aspects of the story. Simple research would have tightened up the facts."
1,Painfully bad writing,"I picked up this book because the premise sounded interesting. I wasn't expecting great literature; just a fun, summer read. But after only two pages, I was already cringing in my seat. Maybe the writing lost something in the translation -- one can only hopes so. Regardless, it was stilted and self-conscious, the sort of thing one reads in a freshman writing class. I slogged through about 50 pages, but finally had to give up. There's only so much pain a person can take in the name of an interesting premise."
1,Boring and stupid!,"Part one of the book was interesting but went way down hill after that. I found the personality of Lauren to be very annoying! The dialogue between the characters sounded as if they were reading off of cue cards and their reactions to their situation were so unrealistic, even for a ""fantasy"" type of story. I ended up skipping from chapter eight to the last page just to see how it ended. I was so disappointed that I found it hard to believe anyone enjoyed this book."
3,Book cover slightly damaged...,"First of all, the book itself is a good story that catches your attention from the very first page. It's a worldwide bestseller,surprise. Highly recommended pageturner !!!"
5,If I wanted something serious I'd turn on the news,"...my title says it. If I wanted something serious I would turn on the news. This storyline is silly, but somehow it works. This is a great book to read on the beach or your comfy couch. Just don't take it too seriously and you will enjoy it."
5,My Sunday..,"Bought this book Saturday evening an read it through in one go on Sunday. It had me happy, sad, an hooked until I turned the very last page.. Read with an open mind an enjoy it :)"
2,Ugh. But I finished it.,"The author's repeated word-for-word use of the ""you won't believe this..."" speech reminded me of schoolkids' 100-word essays: ""I had a very, very, very, very, very, very, very fun summer..."" Did he have a page count to reach, or what?Nor do I understand the bizarre late-book interjection of the police-chief-character-avec-paramour and the exciting new info on Arthur's mom (how is this relevant?).The prose was so stilted -- I don't believe anyone speaks like these characters (translated from la French, eh?).So many problems with this book, maximum 1,000 words in my review...And yet, I finished the book, which to me means that I wanted to know the ending. I'll just never read it again or recommend it.Here's an open plea to excellent contemporary romance writer Judith McNaught -- please publish soon!!!"
2,"""Translation"" ruins the story","Before the movie's release...I read Just Like Heaven. I can now say the movie has to be better than the book. I know it was originally written in French and published there, but the American/English publisher seems to have commissioned a literal French to English translation with horrible results. There is a complete lack of understanding for spoken American English and general American life. The errors make it seem as if the author ""just doesn't get it"" and would have been much better off setting the book in France with French characters. Street intersections are ""crossroads."" EMTs are ""doctors"" who answer calls from the hospital. Doctors and technicians are interchangeably referred to as ""medics"" (although no one is in the U.S. Army in this book). I could go on.... If only a decent translation had been done, reading this book would have been much more fun. The twist at the end is sweet, but it's painful to get there."
1,If Only It Were Good...,"I don't get this book. I too was sucked in by the coverlines that hailed it as an international bestseller and I thought it must be a sweet tale with something extra, maybe like The Little Prince, a book I loved. But this book was so bland, so amateurly written, so obvious that it's hard to believe it was published. Yes, I can see it as a movie with Julia Roberts, as someone else here suggested, but only if they hired a really witty screenwriter who could make this leaden prose sparkle. I like sweet stories but please give me some originality with my sugar. Yuck!"
2,What a disappointment!,"I ordered this book because the plot sounded so promising, and because it supposedly was a best-seller in Europe. Perhaps it was translated from the French -- that would explain the plodding, dull prose. The conversations had no hint of the speakers' personalities. Much like Mary Higgins Clarks characters, they all spoke with the same tone. Real people don't speak in long paragraphs. The characters were flat, the setting seemed more of a soap opera set than real life, and the story was unconvincing. The ending was the predictable happily-everafter stuff of a Harlequin Romance. Are you sure this book wasn't written by a precocious fifteen-year-old girl?"
3,Not True Enough,"This book was so so. Only after I started reading it did I realize I'd seen the movie a while back. I did find several parts of the book comical, but it was all too mushy and goody goody, no conflicts between the main characters Lauren and Arthur. I felt the book going off into Arthur's life with his mother didn't quite fit. Good lessons and all, but I don't know, it just quite didn't click for me. I also didn't care for the parts where dialogue was replaced by summary. It just seemed like the author got tired of dialoguing and then just summarized the rest of what was said. The book wasn't terrible. There was some cute parts in it. But truthfully, I preferred the movie, which is rare for me."
3,not sure,"I don't feel anything from it. things like this need to be taken for a while to be absorbed, and I'm not willing to take it anymore"
1,itchy scratchy uniboob.....,"this bra is very itchy, uncomfortable and a bad buy all around. i am a 48 F and can't find a bra that will support me comfortably. wish someone could make a bra for us bigger breasted women..."
2,Would not recommend!~.........,Would not recommend runs small....stick uncomfortable pointy...everything you don't want in a bra.....it is not something I would ever buy again!~
2,Triangles not circles,"This bra may work for those of us with bullet or more pointy-shaped breats, but if your rounded, like me, this bra is ENTIRELY UNSUITABLE. Even ordering a cup size down, I would have had to stuff something in the nipple area just to fill out the pointed front of the cup. Weirdness! And even if it had fit, the front seams are so obvious and unsightly that tee shirts are out of the question! Let the Madonna jokes fly. This one went promptly back."
3,Average buy,My wife says this just an ok everyday bra but does not give the support it claims to give. Also the value for the cost just isn't there. If it wasn't for Amazon's good price you would feel cheated.
2,Could be better,"The lining falls apart too fast. The 'uplift' band crumbles over time. I ended up cutting the material under the arm and trying to empty it out. The straps are too short for a tall person, so the back keeps riding up and the gel shoulder pads position in front of the shoulder, not on top. A lot of money for such a poor fit."
2,MagicLift by Glamorise,"I was pleasantly surprised at how well this bra fit when it arrived... great coverage in all the right places and very comfortable. However, after having worn it for a few weeks now, it really has ""let me down"" in the support department. It feels more like a sleep bra. I agree with other posters that for larger cup sizes, they should be using non-stretch straps for support. Also, the mesh netting on the back feels very thin and cheaply made, not offering the support it could. I would not buy this product again."
3,Okay Bra,"This bra is not as comfortable as I expected after seeing the video, etc. The below breast band rolls easily and then becomes uncomfortable. I do like the wide straps."
4,Great non-underwire with seams.,"I ordered a 44H normally wear a 42. Should have ordered a 42 because the band is true to size. This bra is very comfortable with padded shoulder straps. Lifts very well for having no underwire. Washed well. Plan on buying another. Not good to wear under T-shirts but with a jacket, scarf, or sweater it provides nice sillouette for such a large cup size."
3,Glamorise Magic Lift full figured bra- is just ok,"I did not find that this bra, although very nice and well constructed, gave me any more lift than the Playtex bras I've been wearing for years. It is a very nice bra, I just didn't get the ""Magic Lift"" I was expecting."
2,Fits funny,Cup size not as generous as others I have had by glamorise. Returned another that was similar to brand slam. Looks pointy under garments.
5,Super Bra!,"Keeps the girls upright and fully operational! Not for lowcut tops, but wonderful for feeling secure and held in place for the larger busted women."
1,Gives no hold for larger busted women,I am a 40F and this bra although it is pretty does not hold or lift the girls up. I will be sticking with Goddess. This bra is good for night-time lounging around the house.
4,A Nice Bra,"It's a nice product, but it seems to run big, which made it a good bra for around the house, but less so for wearing outside."
3,wierd shape ?,"I bought three bras to find a good match for me, I'm a 40D. This is the second best for me. Manly because the cups seemed to make you ""point"" in different directions, I haven't had this before, so I don't think it is me.The straps did stay up , barley, and it left deep marks in at the end of the day. Not a comfortable fit or pleasing shape."
1,No support,"Not strong enough to hold up this size cup. Need stronger material.The woman said ""no support."" Woman said bust not held up."
1,Horrible,Not worth the 25 plus s&h paid for this. Bra is very uncomfortable!!! The cups are very separated making your breast very far apart. Also very pointy making breast look like cones. Did not like one bit
2,should of bought hogue,never will i substitute any gear for the best . I should of bought the hogue grips .which i wound up doing .the grips are not hogue and i will never settle for anything else .EVEN IF I MUST WAIT FOR A MONTH
3,Their first post-Cobra release,"It broke my heart when I heard the JC & BB song on the Cobra soundtrack because I had a feeling that anything and anyone connected with that garbage movie was about to fall into a black hole. I was almost right. This isn't a bad album. Several of the songs, Bound For Glory, Song And Dance and Penetration, work well as fillers for a hits collection, but most of the other songs never quite get off of the ground. Not a bad buy if you're a big fan, but a little thin compared to the previous two albums."
3,not what I expected,"good, but not what I expected...the movie was suggested to me, i didn't know anything about it.but, I love Julian moore"
3,Attack of the cleaning things...,"Another one of those films that i couldnt get on netflix that i just had to see.Julianne Moore is a suburban housewife who endures giving her weasely husband pity sex, having a bratty-know it all son, while existing in a dull,hollow, but safe environment until her body starts to become allergic to her surroundings.I can only imagine one of the reasons this film hasnt been released on dvd is due soundtrack cost...it features some pretty popular songs and could get expensive real quick."
2,Absolutely nothing happens.,"I gave [SAFE] more of a chance than I would anything else, because I hoped and prayed that after 118 minutes, there could somehow be an ending that made up for the silence, the tension, the depression leading up to it. I was impressed by only a few things in [SAFE]. The acting by all involved, most importantly the completely different looking (and sounding) Julianne Moore, is simply excellent. It's understated and drab, just what the film succeeds at best. The music, the clothing and the sets evoke the '80s, the time of the film. The single biggest problem is that you desperately want the plot to lead to a huge ending that wows you, especially after sitting through such a depressing ride of a film - and it does not happen. I just don't get it."
2,Not What I Expected,"As an individual who suffers from some chemical sensitivities, I purchased this movie, thinking that it was really going to be an eye-opening movie for those around me who do not smell the off-gassing carpets, particle-board furniture, or fabric softeners. Instead, I found a movie that begins with a woman who suddenly becomes environmentally ill, but ends with her entering a ""safe haven,"" do nothing for her community instead of a true environmental clinic that would actually assist her in improving her health. I was very disappointed in the movie. And, yes, there are some of us who have been over-exposed to some chemicals that truly become environmentally sensitive!"
4,One to ponder,"I liked it. It's disturbing 'cuz there is no escaping this world... something incredibly sucky always lies at the heart of it no matter where you are or what you do. There is no ""answer"" but people continue to make themselves sick by searching in vain for one."
2,Less is not Moore,"Perhaps my expectations were too high considering how hard this title is to obtain. I ordered a copy from Amazon UK. Todd Haynes' other films - Poison, and Velvet Goldmine - are visually striking, and the framing of Safe reminded me of artwork. This formality however distances us from the narrative, and seems to highlight the miscasting of Julianne Moore. Moore's previous supporting roles showed a tartness which was very appealing. However it is perverse of Haynes to cast her as a bimbo. She may have the skin for her character but she really isn't believable, and Haynes strands her in his huge long shots. When she is called upon to give a speech near the end of the film, it is almost embarassing. The story behind Safe is interesting enough but I think it could have been much more than the curio that it is, if Haynes had used Jessica Harper in the lead, rather than giving her only a few minutes of screen time in a supporting role."
5,not meant for one interpretation,"The best thing about this movie is that a viewers' reaction to it probably tells more about him or her than the film itself. My friends who have had this movie foisted upon them by me have had a variety of reactions, from utter frustration to a rather disturbing identification with it.For myself, I found it the most realistic (or maybe the only) depiction of psychosomatic illness in film. I felt sorry for Moore's character's psychological problems, but I also was amused by the darkly funny satire worked into the critically underappreciated last half of the movie. (Viewed in this way, it's like a Saturday Night Live spoof of a self-help clinic.)I do wish that the studio would price for sale. All thirty people who actually liked the movie would buy it."
2,Falls flat,Gets off to a great start that is eery and weird. But then it morphs into something about people who are allergic to the environment. That's when it gets very boring indeed. You keep expecting something scary to happen. It has a Stepford Wives quality that never pays off. Not worth the bother.
3,SAD,"J. Moore's acting in this movie was quite good.On behalf of this movie I think it is quite profound and very SAD. It just shows how some people with their needy, selfish, attention starved and easily manipulated personalities, can so delude themselves. I thought the charcter of Carol White was pathetic and I felf very sorry for her husband and son. Her husband should have been stronger and gone to stronger measures to get her the REAL help she required (physchiatric treatment) not just an appointment. I also agree with someone's review , that she was more closed in and prison held, then she ever had been at her home.This movie was Sad, but some how holds you to keep watching, and waiting for the character to snap out of it."
2,I agree with Leonard Maltin,"This video really doesn't gel and for me had that ""made for TV/based on a true story"" feel. I could never connect with the main character Carol enough to care about what happened to her and the ending seemed abrupt and pointless. I was very disappointed, I usually like Julianne Moore."
1,"Visually pleasing, but what a waste!!","I wanted to like this movie, I was intrigued and it was visually beautiful, but it was so heavy handed and asked too many questions without giving any answers. How many shots of car exhausts or aerosol dispensers does the director need to make his point? Why is everybody around the main character so devoid of any emotion or compassion? Why is her life , so full of material possessions, so empty? Why is everyone at the retreat either crazy or entraced by the charismatic figure who runs the place? Surely there are people affected by this disorder who don't end up living like the bubble boy. I like Ms. Moore, but she plays this role with a ""deer in the headlights"" look. I don't understand all the rave reviews, I give this turkey one star."
2,"sick,sick,sick!",This is the sickest film I have ever seen. If that is the object of the film - fair enough. It left me feeling unwell and with terrible nightmares! Such a grey depressing movie it is a wonder that there are people that have actualy enjoyed this nightmarish insight into the life of a depressed and totally sick woman. SLOW paced and devoid of any life whatsoever I recommend this movie only if you want to see just how depressing a film can make you feel.
1,my face hurts from slapping it,"I'm sorry, I just didn't get it. I know people like this movie, but I don't like it at all. It's by far the slowest movie I've ever seen. It was beautifully shot, and a slightly interesting plot, even a tad eerie, but just [was bad] right up until the end when absolutely nothing happened. Nothing happened the entire movie! She gets sick from everyday chemicals that are everywhere and seeks refuge from all this pollution in a New Mexico retreat run by a swindler/preist guru type. That's it. Call me spoiled expecting an ending too. Village Voice called it the ""greatest movie of the decade"" and the New York Times said it was ""unnerving"". It's not ""darkly comic"" either. All lies. The movie's one redeeming factor is that it is in fact, original."
5,JUST TO SAY...,A WELL ILLUSTRATED AND INSPIRING COLLECTION FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN ALTERNATIVE PROCESSING. NICE LAYOUT AND EASY READING.STIRS UP THE CREATIVE SIDE AND APPROPRIATE FOR BEGINNERS AND PROFFESSIONALS ALIKE
5,Brain Fracture - -,"Most of this stuff was recorded live and ""The Great Deceiver"" box set has ALL this stuff. But back to this album - when this came out I knew I could never come back, knew I'd never be the same.And now , three bankruptcies, two divorces, 51 jobs and tens of thousands of dollars in mind altering vitamins later, I blame these guys for twisting my life into a pretzel. I still listen to this album. Most call it noise , but to those selected souls with minds blasted enough to hear the delicacies of a smashed viloin held together with duck tape running through 400 watts of Marshall stacks turned up to 11, well there's nothing more sublime--------------&^$%^"
3,Crimson leaves listeners in the dark on Starless.,"Probably the weakest of the Larks' Tongues/Starless/Red trilogy of albums by this revamped Crimson line-up, Starless And Bible Black doesn't quite measure up to the potential that had been established on Larks' Tongues. The shorter songs (The Great Deciever, Lament) seem rushed and under-explored. Worth the price of admission, however, is the brilliant Fracture - a glorious excercise in Robert Frippian guitar weirdness and subtle syncopation, ending in a head-bangingly heavy riff that's sure to take the plaster off your ceilings. The remastering on this CD blows away the sound of previous CDs or the LP."
4,A Great Album But Not the Best for This Lineup,"While being perhaps the weakest of the '72-'74 lineup, this is still an incredible album and a great showcase of the immense talents of Fripp, Bruford, Wetton, and Cross. This album, I feel, contains some of the finest and best improvisational music of this period (""We'll Let You Know"" and ""Fracture"" are perhaps the best live tracks released at the time), but this album also contains some pointless improv (the title track seems to be going nowhere then has a really cool piece then fades out with pointlessness-although I would still recommend listening to it at least once in a while). My only other gripe with the album is that some of the lyrics seem a little weak."
3,FRACTURE!!,"I'm recommending this album for one song; fortunately it's thelongest track here and that tune is FRACTURE.Plainly and simply,this is the most exciting song KING CRIMSON have ever done! thelast four or five minutes of this song are alone worth buyingthis album for!! For the longest time, i had problems distinguishing the guitar from the violin! ROBERT FRIPP has neverbeen better and KC rock out heavier at the end of FRACTURE thanthey ever have, before or since! I don't find the rest of thisnearly as exciting, even tho it has it's moments, like THE GREATDECIEVER and WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. BILL BRUFORD and JOHN WETTON arevery impressive throughout the entire album. I don't like thisalbum as much as i like the first four CRIMSON albums, but istill dig it nonetheless!"
3,Almost There....,"-This album, along with the previous LARKS' TONGUES IN ASPIC, is Crimson's run-up to RED, which is the only truly great Crimson album prior to their 80s masterpieces.With Bruford added to the lineup, TONGUES sets the stage for the transformation, and STARLESS nudges it to the doorstep. Listen to ""The Great Deceiver"" and ""Fracture"" and you will see the door nudge open just a bit, allowing a tantalizing peek into RED.-"
3,Stripped-down King still superior..,"As most Crimsonites know, the group's early first seven albums mostly belong together (e.g.-'Crimson King' and 'Posiedan', 'Lizard' and 'Islands' etc.). With that in mind, compared with it's predecessor, the marvelous 'Lark's Tongues In Aspic', this is largely the inferior album. Perhaps that is an unfair criterion and perhaps not. It is basically the same band, same lyricist, even the mad percussionist whose name escapes me turns up again. But some of the jamming and experimentalism points toward middling-land, and Fripp's riffs never crunch with the same sinister satisfaction found on Lark's. But songs like the rousing 'Lament' are the best the band ever offered up. Basically, it's your call."
2,a failure,"Starless in Bible Black is the worst Crimson album I have heard. The first two tracks are annoyingly satirical, sounding like a bad collection of art-school clichés. Most of the instrumentals are drawn-out, tedious, unnecessary pieces of filler. The only good songs are the surreal marvel, The Night Watch and the grinding, melodic 11-minute instrumental, Fracture which flows with such natural radiance. Not a satisfactory follow-up to the astonishing Larks' Tongues in Aspic."
4,Well it's okay,this was not what I was expecting it to be. It is a good product but smaller than I needed. Holds two gameboy sps and some games.
5,A great movie,"This movie was directed by Mario Bava and and stars Boris Karloff. The movie consists of three short stories: The drop of water,The telephone, and The wardalak. All three stories are really good and are a little creepy. Be warned however, if you want to purchase this movie, there are two versions, the american version and the ittalion version. The ittalion version of is dubbed in ittalion with english subtitles and does not give you the option to hear it in it's natural english but the picture quality is better than the english version.Overall a very good movie."
3,Es mucho horible,"The only good thing about ordering this cd was that it got to me pretty fast only to be very disappointed. The sound quality is why it is so horrible, the person who taped it must have used a tape recorder that was kept in their pocket the whole concert. I'm sure being at that concert would have been great, but the cd is pretty bad because of the quality, you can't even recognize Bob and the I-threes. What more can i say, what should i have expected from a japenese import"
5,"It is the same recording as on ""Live 75""","Yes, this is the same concert as on LIVE from 1975. It has an extra song, Kinky Reggae...A great CD to own from a wonderful concert."
3,Blue LED Switch Non-Functional...,"Sorry to be the naysayer for this product, but the neat 'sunray' switch with the blue LED that indicates charging froze solid after four months. I have had several ICP solar panels and the LEDs always seem to give up early - it's very annoying.Apart from that, it's the best quality product that I've EVER seen that's Made in China..."
2,A book about successful collaboration,"This is a book about a collaboration technique that is packaged as a book about leadership. Although good leaders collaborate, I felt cheated by what this book turned out to cover. Although the book presents sound principles and correctly advises readers to apply these principles personally before using them in groups, I felt that these principles were obvious, low-level stuff. I wanted something more advanced."
1,The title ought to be different,"I read the book carefully, i kept looking for triggers on leadership, i found none that i felt effective. It is an alright book on collaboration but not on leadership. The topics were not stongly emphasized, basically i gained no knowledge out of reading this book. I kept feeling bad i did not buy getting to Yes."
3,Not 0.5 inch diameter,"Sturdy enough rod and nice enough quality, but it's spec'd poorly on Amazon's web site. It is not a 0.5in (12.7mm) diameter rod as suggested by the dimensions provided. I was looking for something directly equivalent to Gibraltar 12.7mm rods. This item is more like 3/8in (or maybe equivalent to Gibraltar's 10.5mm) diameter- I haven't measured exactly because I'm likely returning it unopened due to the diameter surprise. So just beware."
5,Penn-Elcom H1053 Surface Mount Handle Black,Works great . Very strong . Spring loaded . Nice grip around the rectangular handle for comfortable carrying . Great Item !
5,Very well built and sturdy!,"Not really much to say about something straight forward like this. It's a good price, well built and sturdy and has plenty of screw holes so that it fastens well to the cabinet. I'm using 2 of these for a modified guitar speaker cabinet that I own. I needed something strong and easy to grip that I could put on either side for single person transport. 2 of these fit the bill just right. I would definitely recommend these for any cabinet application, easy to grip, durable and because they're spring loaded they never get in the way!"
3,"Good, but not as good as the others","My daughter and I have played four of the games now, and this was our least favorite. It is still a high quality game, and was fun to play, but it was a step backward in the series. Our main complaints are that there are not enough places to explore and items to manipulate, and far too many lengthy dialogues on the phone. Many of the conversations are all passive--the program directs both your speech and the person you're talking to, leaving you to just watch and listen to a long, pre-determined conversation. The game was also shorter to play than the others, and the puzzles were rather easy by comparison.Even with these drawbacks, it is still a higher quality game than so much else that's out there, and I'd buy it again if I had to do it all over."
4,A Great game for all ages,"This is a good game, and for once I can actully say that it is good for any age. It is fun, and sometimes a little tricky, but after a while of fooling around you can usally figure it out. This game is also good because you dont need a super good computer to use it. You only need 16 mb of ram(memory), which is considerably less compared to other games. The graphics are good, and highly detailed. And overall I would very much recommend this game."
1,"Nancy Drew: Final Scene, by HerInteractive","This was an ok game. It wasn't as good as the other games I have played. It had a fun plot, but it got kind of boring as I continued to play it. The ""3-Days"" idea got a little annoying after a while. But, still this game pretty good."
1,boring,This game is so boring. All you do is try to find things and get the mystery solved before it is too late. It's hard to even get a few clues and the person who got most clues were my baby sistter who is older then me!!!!!! Plese do not waist your money on this game.
1,Couldn't get past first Chamber,"I gave this as a present to my Wife, but shecouldn't get past the first level, running under WIn 98SE."
1,I am extremely annoyed by this game,"I was hesitant about buying any of these Nancy Drew CD-ROMs because I was never any good at solving the mysteries in the books. The only reason I finally decided to purchase one of them was because the package said that the game had built in hints if you wanted them. That statement is completely misleading. The only built in hints the game has is Bess, Ned, and George telling you to question all of the suspects. I'm not so stupid that I can't figure out on my own that I should question the suspects. The hints on the company's website was of no help to me. I was able to do on my own what the website tells you to do. The stupid company doesn't give hints to the harder clues because they want you to buy their solution guide. Which I admit I'll probably end up buying it, if I don't get mad and break the cd first, but I know one thing. The Final Scene is my first and last of their products that I will buy."
3,It's OK in my book!,"This is the first Nancy Drew game I've ever played,and I do plan on playing some others in the series, because this is a high-quality game, and I'm sure the other games in this series are,too. Any one who is considering buying this game, I say to go for it. It is totally worth your money. But...I did see a few minor problems. First of all, the screen kept on going black, and I kept having to move the cursor around to restore the picture. Also, there was a dialogue error too, when I read a word in the dialogue box, but the character was saying something else. But, I still like the CD, and the people at HerInteractive did a really good job! I actually wouldn't be surprised if boys started playing! I just don't think this one will be my favorite game. But keep up the good work HerInteractive!"
5,AWESOME,"I love this game series! It's over the edge excitement where you get to intervine with the characters. It did not interest me before I was 10, but now that I'm 11, it's the best. I absoloutley love The Final Scene. It was my first ND mystery. So far I have also done Treasure in the Royal Tower(ok), Haunted Carousel and Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake. I love how you get to go outside in Ghost Dogs, it's creepy, it's great! What can I say, I'm hooked!"
4,Totally Awesome,"This game was just awesome! The music created an eerie feel and the plot was very intersting. However, the puzzles were not that challeging and the graphics weren't great. But any ND fan would want this on their shelf!"
3,Fun to play but way too short!,This was a fun game to play. I did love the hidden rooms and the feel of an old theater in the game. The end is intense with the time limit and the scary music. My biggest complaint is it was too short. A good quick game. Still recommend for Nancy Drew fans.
3,My Review,"I thought this game was OK... not nearly as good as the first Nancy Drew game I played (Treasure in the Royal Tower) I knew who the kidnapper was from the first time I talked to them... and it became pretty boring after that. The theater is way too dark and it's really hard to see around it. There aren't enough places to explore like there were in Treasure in the Royal Tower. Overall, it's a pretty good game, but not as good as some of the others."
2,Not as good as TRT or MHM,I found this game to be a big disappointment. There weren't enough puzzles and the game was too short. I also found the identity of the kidnapper to be painfully obvious from Day 1. It's worth buying if you're a huge fan of these games but I can't recommend it very highly to those who aren't.
4,Entertaining for all!,"My 7 year old daughter and I played this together. The graphics are great. The object is to find your kidnapped friend. There are two levels - junior or senior detective. We played as senior detectives. It was challenging at times, there were no clues at what to do next. I found myself searching the internet for clues (the manufacturer actually provides a bulletin board for the game if you get stuck). If you make a mistake, the game ends, but there is s second chance button you can use (more than once) to continue where you left off.I found it hard to move where I wanted to go at times. The cursor has to be placed just so and it limits your view.I liked the game, but I liked Message in the Haunted Mansion better. My daughter liked them both. With the internet help, our total play time was about 7-8 hours, and the time we spent was fun and entertaining."
4,A Great Mystery!!!!!!!,"In this ND Game, Nancy is visiting her friend Maya in St. Louis. The mystery takes place at the little old Royal Paladium Theater. The theater was built in 1925 originally as a magic show building and was turned into a movie house in the 50s. However, the last screening movie ""Vanishing Destiny""s star, Brady, is to be interviewed by Maya 3 days before the theater will be torn down. But when Maya is kidnapped, it is a race against time as you (Nancy Drew) have to find her in a mere 3 days!!!!! This game is challenging, and involves you using your best detective skills. This game is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good but not the best.,"This is the second Nancy Drew game that I've played (Treasure in the Royal Tower was my first) I thought this game was good, but not nearly as good as the other one. There aren't nearly as many places to explore, and I finished this game pretty quickly, while the other one took me days and days. It's also not nearly as exciting as the other one. Overall though, I would reccomend it... but it's a letdown from the previous game I played."
5,NANCY DREW CRACKS A CASE OF DANGER BEHIND THE CURTAIN!,"The fifth Nancy Drew Interactive Mystery, 'The Final Scene,' was very entertaining and challenging; 10 times better than the book. Nancy's mission, however, is much more desperate: A friend of hers is kidnapped. But what did the kidnapper want with Maya? She was just interviewing the star of 'Vanishing Destiny' at the Century Cinema, but then she disappeared! What secrets does the theater hold? And why-who?-kidnapped Maya? It's all up to you as you step into Nancy's shoes and make your move against a kidnapper who's determined to keep Maya until the final scene!"
4,"I Like Theater, so i definitely liked this game!","I got this as a Christmas gift, and at first I thought it sounded good, but I didn't know if I would finish it. I finished it, and I played it again! I liked the way the music sounded, very jazzy, old-fashioned and carnivalish at times. The 3D graphics were good, the theater looked realistic, the characters were flavorful. It's rated E for everyone, but it says ""ages ten and up"" on the thing. And rightfully so. I'm almost thirteen and I thought some of the parts were spooky or tense and my heart was beating fast. Still, I liked this game."
1,"Agreed - this is junk, but also not as pictured...??","I have to agree with other recent reviewers that this is junk. My 2 1/2 year old received this as a Christmas gift. Our cover does not have the mesh sides that are shown in this picture above - perhaps that is the difference between the good reviews and the bad ones. I think if it did, the seat cover wouldn't pop off and it would help to keep the seat in the proper position. Ours just flops back and is pretty much *the* most useless toy we have in the house. Unfortunately I've already tossed out the box, otherwise I would definitely be seeking an exchange. Very disappointing."
1,Huge Disapponitment,We purchased this for my 27 month old daughter who LOVES to play with her babies. We assembled it very carefully and it worked great until she moved it. She carried it from one room to the other and the next thing we knew the thing quit working completely! She was so sad & it made us very frustrated. Fisher-Price should test this thing with children before putting it on the shelf. Sham on you. We will be returning this for another brand & kind of doll swing. Deserves 0 stars.
1,The Worst!!! Do NOT Buy!!!!!,"This is the first review that I am writing. I bought this toy from Toy's R Us for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas. She was so excited to get. The first time she put a doll in it, the back part of the seat immediately collpased!! I thought hat maybe this one had a defect. So, I went back to the store and sxchanged it for another one. Well, the same thing happened. Not only does the back part of the seat collapse, but the seat itself comes snaps off all the time and the seat cover also comes off. I am so disappointed that Fisher Price would put their name this product. Do not buy it. It's a waste of money. I will try to go back to Toys R Us and return it all together, but we threw away the box!"
1,"Big Disappointment, Save your Money!","The cloth seat cover will not stay on and the ""adjustable"" seat fell clear back to the floor on the one we received. I paid more for this swing, thinking I was paying for quality, I was very disappointed."
2,Disappointed with purchase,"I purchased this swing for my 3.5 year old for Christmas. Easy to assemble-was hoping for as good an outcome with my daughter. Unfortunately, every time she puts a baby (17""-Baby Annabell~Zapf) in the swing, the seat comes unattached from the swing itself. The seat was removable for a child to play with it independent from the swing however, it comes off every time my daughter tries to put a baby in the swing. To reattach, is a true hassle (the brackets that hold the seat are hard to snap into place w/o bending the swing itself). My daughter is already mad with the swing and we've only had it one day! This toy will be going back to the store ASAP!"
1,CUTE BUT NOT VERY STURDY,"I bought this as a gift for my two daughters, ages 8 and 4. This toy looks very realistic and seems to work really well as a swing. The problem is that taking the seat off and putting it back on (to convert between swing and booster seat) is extremely difficult and cannot be done by a child. If you are buying this for a young child to use as a doll swing then I would recommend it, but if you are buying it for the 3 in 1 ... I would not recommend it. It is not made to be converted back and forth."
4,My daughter enjoys this swing,She recieved this for Christmas and she is 3 1/2. She has been enjoying this toy every day. She can pick it up and bring it into other rooms.The issue about the swing part popping off happened to us until I saw that where you snap the swing part onto the base has a little plastic bump and the swing part has a little hole in the that the plastic has to meet up with. Since then it hasn't popped off once.She has been using it with her Baby Alexa doll and a 20 inch Lots to Cuddle doll. The 20 inch has to squeeze in but it still fits.
4,Good advice on how to listen,"Pros: This is a good book about how to listen to people and accomplish your goals. The author provides information on how you can improve your listening and communications skills when dealing with people with an end goal of creating a [win-win] (my words, not the authors) situation.Cons: The language is dated at times, and I question some of the ""facts"" that he mentions (there are several ""psychologists have proven..."" type of lines used here and there); mostly due to lack of adequate citation and my own rudimentary knowledge about the field of psychology.All in all, this is a great book and a short read! Spend a weekend reading it and put some of Les' advice into practice!"
5,"This is my very favorite ""success book"". IT WORKS!","I started reading self-help books 25 years ago. I have built up quite a personal library. This book is easy and fun to read. There are no wasted words-every sentance is filled with practical substance. If you wish to really be successful and happy at work or with your friends, you must get this book!"
4,"""A lot of great advise--but a bit of a bore.""","I've owned this book for some time, but have only recently read it. Many other authors have recommended it, as well as quoted it. For a short book, (less than 200 pages) it took me too long to read it. It is definitely a book worth reading and re-reading, but with other books which are better written, this one may sit on my shelf for some time. Again, this book does contain positive information, so I do recommend it."
4,Old but relevant,"This book was written some years ago, but it is relevant even for today.I haven't read all of the book as of yet, but it is very good and useful so far."
2,"Good book, but not readable!",When someone buys this book he's expecting not to know how to put it down but I did! The content is good but the way of telling is is a bit boaring. The best part about this book is that it has a written plan of action to change the character you hate most about yourself.
1,Stopped reading by page 13.,"""Unless you believe that there is a Creator who has endowed men with unalienable rights, with an innate worth, you cannot very well believe in people."" - Giblin p 13. I stopped reading right there. Those who don't believe in a Creator (capitalizing the ""C"" cracks me up) are, in other words, incapable of believing in other people and more importantly, themsleves. I believe self confidence can be achieved by anyone regardless of race, sex, and culture. If a book throws ultimatums around like frisbees, especially about religion, undertones or not, it is ignoring a particular demographic and what makes one person more capable than another person? It damn sure is not religion."
4,The key is being genuine,"The principles in this book are sensible for most instances and easy to understand. Relaxing and being yourself are key and this was echoed in Psychocybernetics by Maltz. However, I do caution the reader that many, many people do the exact opposite of a lot of Giblins suggestions and are extremely popular and successful. If you have nice tendencies and sincerely can follow Giblins suggestions, it might well work. But if you have sincere, genuine tendencies that include selfishness, putting others down and backstabbing, that can work too (people do seem to likee that). The key is finding out who you are and what way works for you. Good luck!"
4,A very Aussie stuff,"A show of debilitative male teens in recent feminism-swept Australia embeds a contemporary world trend of sexualisation and infantilism this work parades in Australia, the USA and Japan particularly.As understood, the same male artist performed different film characters of various genders, ages and behavioural patterns hardly making a reviewer laughing at this kind of transvestism.Rude, sexist, stupid as environment is by itself the Australian producers know surely the best while having successfully targeted a public attention to their opus.No offence so far."
2,Not Actual episodes,"I did watch the series when it originally aired. These DVD's were ""cuts"" and repetitiveplayovers. Not as the original episodes. Loved the original but not this rendition."
3,Worth a look,"There is a quiet charm to this movie, it worms its way into your subconscious and even as you sit there watching and mentally making notes of all the inconsistencies (not to mention all the predictable clichés and resolutions) it still manages to entertain you so that you just don't care after a while.The actors manage to rise above the mediocre treatment of the material --the editing seems choppy at times and the continuity suffers because of it-- nevertheless it is a solid couple of hours of entertainment, and I'm sure highly enjoyable to hopeful romantics everywhere.The DVD itself is nothing special. No special features at all. The image and sound are good but the frame froze a few times during transitional scenes. I don't know if this is because of my DVD player or the disk itself. Overall, it is a worthy addition to any A&E/BBC collection."
2,Dissapointingly below my expectations...,"I discovered this DVD at my local library, and curiously decided to rent it because of A&E's renown classics (Pride and Prejudice, Les Miserables...)and the synopsis on the back which made it seem like a very captivating movie. Unfortunately, this movie seemed very poorly produced (if you notice, though Karver is at least 10 years John's senior, he doesn't seemed to have aged from the moment he kills john's father when john was little to the moment he is out to kill John as an adult...)with weak and trite dialogue spoken by obvious amateurs. The plot was fairly good (though very cliche in some aspects), and I won't totally discredit the book for all of the imperfections I have pointed out in the movie (though I have not read it), but I do think that the book probably deserves more credit than the movie does."
2,Watch it if you want a good laugh,"I am a huge fan of BBC period drama and have nearly exhausted my library's supply of miniseries based on the works of Austen, Gaskell, Dickens, and Eliot. But I would have to say that the BBC struck out this time. The direction was bad, the acting was mediocre at best, the music was obtrustive, and the screenplay was just plain awful. After the first half-hour my sisters and I survived the rest by poking fun at one cliche after another. I have not read the book so I don't know how much of it is from the source material. Makes me curious to read it, though. The costumes and some of the scenery were good; I'll give it that."
2,lornaDoone,I enjoyed the movie as is.. was disappointed that the actors voices were'nt more Scottish sounding since that's the area where the play originated from...The maiden Lorna seemed inexperienced but I gave her initial credit..melissa
2,Not A&E's Usual Great Productions,"I love A&E's high quality entertainment movies; sadly this movie is disappointing. The movie doesn't flow, and it's hard to relate and become involved with the characters because the movie doesn't flow. It's watchable, but you wouldn't want to waste your time watching it again."
4,jeff returns,"well this was very well filmed and acted, but i couldn't get over the fact that john ridd was jeff from coupling! i kept expecting him to make a dirty joke..."
5,This is the best version of Lorna Doone.,The actor and actress were generally unknown to me but I have come to appreicate and enjoy their acting styles. It's a great movie and I have enjoyed it many times.
5,Unbelievable,"One of the best movies that I have ever seen. The acting is fantastic and the storyline is great. Romance, suspense, turmoil, tragedy, sacrifice, this movie has it all. Not your typical action or romance movie by any stretch of the imagination. It will not disappoint viewers."
2,Very Mediocre,"The script was overwraught, the direction was predictable. Even the casting was a bit wobbly. Aiden Gillen was enjoyably evil as the villain, Carver Doone, and Jack Shepherd and Anthony Calf are always good. But I found Richard Coyle made for a pretty lifeless hero, and while I think Amelia Warner is a good actress (see Quills) I thought she seemed far too smooth and polished for someone brought up with the likes of Carver. It would have been more fun if she'd had just a little bit more spirit. The film dragged on far longer than was necessary, and was generally not cohesive."
1,Lorna Doone,Bought it as a present for my fiancee but half way through Christmas Day afternoon it just stopped. Was not happy !! Some of my purchases were available at amazon on line to watch on tv but of course not Lorna Doone ! Just my luck !Not much you can do as once opened I cant send it back!
5,Simple but good,I was looking for flashcards that have the problem on one side and the answer on the other. These fit that description and are just what we were looking for.
4,Flash Card Review,"These are much easier to use than the dual sided cards. They were a bit pricey and for the price I would have expected a little thicker. That being said, I would definitely buy them again."
3,A Reviewer With Ears,"All right, first off. This album is AS GOOD AS ""I Didn't See It Coming"", but it's certainly not better or worse. The main difference is the raunchier, murkier mixes of ""Kick Down The Doors"" and ""Little Boys In Blue"", but I personally prefer the poppier versions on the larger album.Besides, along with the re-recorded mixes of these songs, ""I Didn't See..."" also contains a number of b-sides and covers, though there are a few more rarities missing. ""1-2-3"", ""Join The Professionals"", ""Kamikaze"", and ""Mods, Skins, and Punks"" all sound identical to the other album.If you're thinking of which to buy, it's not really worth buying this one if you have the other."
4,Convenient,Easily installed with my Liftmaster opener. At times you must repeat the code if you we're tentative with one of the keys on the first try. Pressing ENTER takes getting used to as my other opener did not require that.
5,"Easy to mount, matched up with my Lift Master 1/2 hp operator on first try","Easy to mount, matched up with my Lift Master 1/2 hp operator on first try. Very reasonable cost. Easy to program, and it will accept a second ""temporary"" code for visitors."
1,Know Your Learn Button Color!,"I'm giving this item 1 star because of poor documentation in hopes of keeping others from making my mistake.I have a Liftmaster 1245R garage door opener and the documentation explicitly states that the 976LM/977LM works with it. I even confirmed this with Liftmaster customer support.Well, it doesn't.I have a GREEN learn button and the 977LM documentation states you must have an ORANGE learn button.I ended up having to get a Chamberlain KLIK2U.And returning the 977LM wasn't practical because of shipping charges and a $10 restocking fee."
3,Good but could be better,"I had to buy one as a replacement because the original died from ice infiltration after a few years. Although this unit works OK there are some features I don't like. One is that you have to enter in the code to close the door. Doh!! A code to open, yes, a code to close, stupid. The other thing I don't like about this is that you can only have one primary code. You can enter a temporary code but it will only be good for either a period of time or a number of entries (255 hrs or 255 times) so, theoretically, you can have a secondary ""permanent"" number but you would have to reset it at some point(yearly, every two years) so this is also a stupid design."
2,does not work with my garage,"I know that this is my fault, but I failed to ensure that this opener was universal. It only works with the same brand motor. I am going to see if i can return it."
4,High tech for a low tech lady,This product provides 'lost key' access for a security residence. First product failed after the warranty period but I consider this to be a fluke. I have reordered the same product.
3,Buttons are not great,"I find the buttons (thick rubber) to be loose and flubbery, and it's easy to miss registering a number or even have a button get caught under the edge of the opening. I'd prefer something firmer and more tactile, as would my wife."
1,Bad range of the system,"Bought a replacement Transmitter and receiver system from AAA remotes, CA . Problem was the Liftmaster 9* serie transmitters is work on 390 MHz and that frequency is currently jammed by the military. The range of the transmitter gets very small that you have to physical touch the door before it recognizes the signal. AAA remotes is aware of this and keeps on advertising the 9* series as an good replacement system and does not put any disclaimers near the 9* serie products. AAA remotes did not want to replace/exchange for the 315 Mhz models. They are really horrible at their customer service and this policy. I definetly recommend never buy from this organization."
5,"Simple to program, Worked first time","Our LiftMaster wireless keypad failed after a repairman damaged it while making repairs to the frame around the garage door. I ordered this unit based on the positive reviews from many, many Amazon customers and as usual, the crowd has nailed it.The unit was delivered in great shape. It came out of the box with a battery installed (nice). And the instructions for programming it to open the garage doors were so simple and easy to follow, I had the thing working in less than 15 minutes. That was a good thing since it was cold outside when I installed it.Important - We have LiftMaster garage door openers so getting this wireless device seemed like a no-brainer. The ease with which it all came together proved me correct.Highly recommended for anyone looking for a LiftMaster compatible keypad."
5,Garage door opener,"I initially purchased an incorrect product. The company was great. The exchanged it for the proper keypad, no hassles. To program the keypad took between 3-5 minutes, very, very easy. Two screws to put it on the garage, worked from moment one. Great keypad very easy to program"
4,Garage Door Opener,Happy that Amazon offers items that are not easy to find in stores. Easy to program and easy to install.
5,WORKS PERFECT,"With in five minutes of receiving my new remote, I had it programmed and installed. It work perfect. If you have a lift master, not sure you could get a better remote"
2,Item Received Not as Advertised,"The item advetised is the 976LM/977LM Garage Door Wireless Keyless Entry Pad. It was a good price, s0 I ordered two. Surprise! I received 2 940CBs instead. The Liftmaster website recommended at 977LM for my garage door. When contacted, the seller stated it is an older model and that 977 was listed on the package. I looked and, you guessed it,it didn't. The package said 940CB only and a typed label added to the package mentioned 976, not 977. The advertised model is white. These are grey. While the 940CB does work with our door, it is obvious on our white garage door frame. I might have purchased an older model at this price, but would have appreciatd the opportunity to price-compare it and make the decision myself. To avoid any further waste of time, I have decided to keep the units, but would not do business with this seller again."
5,Perfect,Just what I wanted. I have always had these type of units on the outside of my garages. This unit is made well and easy to set up and operate. Has nice red lit keys when operating for visability.
3,Nice if it works.,"Overall, it seems worth the money as far as material quality. The one I got wouldn't connect to my 635LM receiver. After digging for quite a while I found a number for customer service for LiftMaster and they replaced it after testing a few things with me over the phone.Customer service, once reached, was friendly and knowledgeable, and I received my replacement quickly."
1,Cannot get product to work,My son has this same pad and he or I cannot get it to work. He took it to his home and it would not work there either. We are still trying.
4,Must have for every Garage...,"I have used one of these for more than 10 years. They work great. The only problem (other than having to change the battery every couple of years) is that eventually the code stops working. This has happened several times to me over the years. Apparently something internally on one or more of the buttons wears out or fails. The solution to fix the problem is to change the code to one that uses numbers that are different from the previous code. I think I am on my third different code at this point.We use our keyless entry pad many times everyday. It has served us very well over the years... Highly recommended and a ""Must Have"" for every garage."
5,Replacement Keypad a perfect fit,Not often can you buy something 10 years later that is an exact replacement for the item that has worn out. I purchased this Liftmaster 976lm keypad on amazon and recieved it 2 days later and it was the exact part that I had used for 10 years before it finally broke. I used the same single cement screw that held the previous keypad in place and was finished installing and programming in under 5 minutes. A good deal all around.
4,Works Like a Charm..,Product came in its own package box and even had a battery already on it. It configured very smoothly no issues with my Garage opener.
1,Bad advertising,"The determining factor for compatibility of these door openers is the frequency of the transmitter/receiver. It is not the ""orange-red"" button on the opener. Compatibility should be determined by the color of the remote transmitter. Open door remotes claims that the orange button is the compatibility test. It is not.The color of the transmitter buttons indicates the frequency. Then, after an entry pad is shipped, there is a ten dollar restocking fee. Be careful of this outfit."
2,garage door opener,"Opener will NOT function on side by side garage doors. Will only function for ONE door. In order to return this item, which costs just over $18.00, this company charges a $10.00 RESTOCKING FEE plus you must pay your own shipping. Certainly a rip-off, particularly for a product not advertised clearly. Would never purchase another item from this company."
5,Works as advertised,Easy to install and setup. Works fine. Will need a ladder to reach door opener to sync device opener and keypad.
5,"great, simple, reliable, and easy to use","There is not much to say in addition to what the others said. works great, very easy to set up and install. One more thing - I wish the length of the code would me more then 4 digits."
2,Buyer Beware!,"While the description says the running time is 110 minutes, this is actually the edited version which is 80 minutes at the start of the credits. The picture quality is poor (like a copy of an old VHS) and the sound is not much better. Not bad for 5 bucks, but if you are a true fan of the film, keep your eyes open for a full length copy of Phenomena which is harder to find."
3,A good movie,"Creepers deserves more credit then it actually gets. It's an italian movie, and parts of it seem like it's dubbed, but I really thought it was done very well. Donald Pleasant actually was great, it was nice to see him in another movie besides all the HALLOWEEN movies. Jennifer Connenly (sp?) gives a great performance to, as a girl who is sent to a boarding school. She has a very weird, but special talent. She can call and communicate with insects. There are murders happening all around the school, a killer who is after young girls...mainly tourists. The movie keeps a good pace, and the end has a great twist. This movie is worth checking out!"
5,Digital Camera,"This has to one of the best digital cameras on the market. As an employee at a community college I had the use of this camera at all activities that we needed recorded. I found it so easy to use, download the pictures, ease of transferring to the printer, and lightweight. The picture quality is so sharp/clear that you would think you were using a very expensive model. I purchased this camera for my personal use and would recommend it to everyone - it's that easy to use and you would not be disappointed."
5,Jesus & His Miracles,My sons 3 & 6 really enjoy these Beginners Bible VHS. They want to watch them weekly.
3,review for listen now,"Well, I had to order this cd twice. The first time it arrived, the cd that I ordered was not inside the cd case, a different one was instead. The second time I ordered the cd, the same strange cd (not listen now) was inside the cd case. However, upon listening to the cd enclosed, I discovered that the cd was indeed listen now with a different cd's label on the front of it. A bit of a mess...."
1,What are they listening to?,"I don't know what the other reviewers have been listening to but it can't be the cd I just got. It is a dreadful, limp, dated piece of prog-jazz fusion. While 801 Live is highly recommended you can best avoid this turkey."
3,You will receive a random color,"These are very cute and work great but you cannot select the color you want. I got a pink set that says Daddy's Girl. Also, you can find these much cheaper at your local dept stores."
4,Does the book have a CD with it?,"I am kind of confused now, the book says there is a CD included with the book, but my book came alone without any CD? Did the seller make a mistake or it has other way to access to the CD?"
2,Not what I would call an Introduction.,"This does not appear to be a true ""introductory"" text. I would not recommend it as a first text on time series.A good bit of the text is spent walking through derivations of formulae, and many of the exercises do not use actual data, but are directions such as ""Derive the recursions for the Burg estimates..."" or ""Derive a cubic equation for the maximum likelhood estimates of..."" There is too little information on how to proceed in analyzing actual data.The book is not well-organized, but appears to have been thrown together hurriedly, and lacks any connecting flow. Coverage of topics is more brief as you get to the later chapters, which is another indication of rushing something into print."
2,What is an introduction?,"The term 'introduction' is odd for a book bristling with mathematical symbols. Some academics don't always understand that people without mathematical training still need to use concepts taught in universities.This book is excellent if you've had that training and want to expand your knowledge. It's really an introduction at the top floor of the learning edifice, not the front entrance!More positively, the software that comes with it is excellent. The examples are clear enough and you can bypass a lot of the deeper mathematics by letting the program suggest the best models. But the only way to get the full benefit of it is to understand the accompanying discussion. This I tried to do by looking in other books (and the WWW) for a more straightforward approach directed at 'dummies'.For an introduction to the complex area of time series analysis a lot less maths would have made this book much more readable. But I will keep at it."
2,Horrible,"This was such a mess to try and put together. We ended up taking it back and getting the graco pack in play, which thankfully is already put together!"
1,Breadth without Depth,"As an undergraduate student taking an upper level wireless circuits course, this book was mandatory and severely disappointed both the class and the instructor. While the book introduces several topics relevant to RF engineering, it goes nowhere in developing central ideas and providing adequate explanations for equations. The logical flow is broken throughout the text, and it would only make sense to someone already familiar to RF engineering. To any engineering students familiar with thin texts covering expansive subject matter, and offering no concrete insight, this book fits perfectly into that category. The one section that developed a little better than the others concerned a review of resonant circuits, however, other texts are available that offer much better coverage."
4,Great behind the scenes stories....,"I lived in Memphis when Andy Kaufman and Jerry Lawler had their infamous ""feud"" and I thought it was one of the funniest things I had ever seen. Andy Kaufman was at times a comic genius with unmatched ability to get under your skin. Zmuda spends a little too much time putting Andy on a pedestal for my tastes, but I enjoyed the book and the behind the scenes stories. The stories about the experiences of Tony Clifton are especially entertaining.As an aside, Andy had really some severe emotional problems."
5,There goes my hero,"Before reading this book, I had a mild fascination with the man known as Andy Kaufman. After reading this book, I live, breath and think Kaufman. It has changed my way of thinking. I am only 16 years old now. But, this book has given me inspiration as to what to do with my life. Finally, I am sure what I want to do thanks to this great book. This was actually the first book that I could not put down. If you love Andy, you will love this in depth book."
5,Wow great sushi recipes!,"I never tried making sushi like this before. It's so hard to get a firm grip on an eel. But now, it's all clear."
3,A good read but only for Andy Kaufman fans.,"If you're an Andy Kaufman fan as I am, this is worth the read. Zmuda makes Andy less mysterious and less strange. But mysterious - the book isn't really revealing about what drove Andy. The anecdotes, however, are interesting, particularly the Tony Clifton saga. Zmuda is not a great writer but he's a good source. For Andy fans, it's a necessary read. For others - you'll want to pass on this one."
5,"A wonderful, first hand book about a fascinating artist.","I've always been fascinated by Andy Kaufman, but never realized what a wonderful, funny, brilliant and terriffic artist he really was. Bob Zmuda's compelling first hand account of his partner and friend is heartwarming, informative, and touching. He really lets you in on the secrets, and makes you miss Andy and wonder what could have been had he not passed at such an early age. I loved it."
5,"screamingly funny, joyously lewd, profoundly moving","If you think you know something about Andy Kaufman, you have to read this book. If you know nothing about him, you absolutely have to read it. AKR not only leaps off the page but runs around your living room. You'll feel as though you lived this genius' too-short life right along with him. Screamingly funny, joyously lewd, profoundly moving. The definitive book about this legendary icon. Read this book... now!"
5,EXCELLENT BLEND OF POIGNANCE AND HUMOR,"Extremely funny and (at times) very sad. Bob Zmuda has created a highly readable biography, while including a few interesting digressions and personal anecdotes. A real winner!"
5,Hilarious! Couldn't put it down.,"This book rocks! I'd only heard about Andy Kaufman's legendary live shows, and reading this book is the next best thing to being there. Funny funny funny, with the biggest surpirse -- a moving ending that brought me to tears. Get three copies -- one for yourself and two for your friends."
5,Who is Mr. X?,"Loved the book. Don't usually buy hard backs but in this case it was worth every penny. Read the book because I am 21 and Andy was before my time. I want to see the movie Man On The Moon, but wanted some insight into Andy before I did. The book not only gave me insight, but made me laugh out loud many times at stories of Bob and Andy's adventures. My only question is: Who is Mr. X? Does anyone have any idea? Please e-mail me. I really want to know. (If only to know when to stack the furnature in front of my door in case he ever shows up at my doorstep. :)) tysherif@inreach.com"
5,One Of The Best Books I Have Ever Read!,"Kaufman and Zmuda were geniuses, and this book is the proof!We'll never see another artist like Andy Kaufman. He truly was one ofa kind, and it's too bad that he had to leave us. Bob Zmuda is a wonderful story teller, and has done an excellent job writing this book. I was never bored for a minute. Zmuda is highly under-rated. Buy his book!"
2,"Should be called ""Andy & Me""","Zmuda should have called this book ""Andy and Me,"" with the emphasis on the ""me."" For instance, we read five pages about what Zmuda was doing while Andy was getting started (one page). And pretty much anything Andy was doing sans Zmuda is ignored. This is actually Zmuda's memoirs of his life, with and without Andy; it's not a biography."
1,"""Zmuda Revealed"" or "" How to take credit for Kaufman""","Why did this guy waste my time in making me think the book was about Andy Kaufman. I only hope he doesn't have any other ""friends"" to write about. I know more than I care to know, about Bob Zmuda. Like he lacks humility.... John O'Hara was right on the button with his review."
2,Watch the movie. Skip the book.,Love Andy! Hate the book. The used bookstore won't even buy it back. I think someone is trying to cash in on Andy one last time.
1,Why now?,"This book is poor. It really doesn't cover Taxi, because Zmuda wasn't welcome on the set. Kaufman's past is retold better by Bill Zemhe. Zmuda spends little time on his(Kauffman's) childhood, and a lot of time on himself. The only thing you can't get anyone else is firsthand accounts of his caurousing, which I can live without.The book beat Zemhe's book to the presses. If Zemhe's book had been first, I never would have bought this one.Zmuda is just a friend who is making a quick buck or two. It's obvious that he never cared about Taxi, and considering the astounding lack of depth concerning Kaufman's childhood, it's clear to me that he was never really known, but less liked by the Kauffmans. Buy Zemhe's book. Unless you want R-Rated Kauffman exploits, don't waste your money on this."
1,Avoid This Book if You Have Fond Memories of Andy Kaufman,"I can't believe I read the whole thing. By the end I felt queasy from immersion in Kaufman's unhappy life. Zmuda's main points: Andy Kaufman was sick, sick, sick and he really liked me, me, me!"
3,A quick entertaining read.,"If you want to know about Andy Kaufman, this is the book to read. Kaufman's good friend, Bob Zmuda was there and saw everything first hand. The book is plenty funny and goes a long way to showing how eccentric Kaufman was. It's definitely from the perspective of a good friend who wishes to lionize the comedian. Maybe more interesting than the Kaufman story is Zmuda's description of the insane screenwriter he worked for. The guy and Zmuda would travel around the city with a wad of bills looking for dialogue. The story is just as preposterous as any act that Kaufman ever pulled off, but it is so fun to read. Whether Kaufman will be considered a comedic genius in 50 years is anyone's guess, but this book is a good witness for his cause."
3,Filled with inaccuracies!,"Zmuda's and his writing partner's account of his Andy Kaufman is filled with inaccuracies that make a lot of the less easily verifiable information harder to believe. There are many so-called quotes of Andy Kaufman from when he made guest appearances on various shows. I have some of these appearances on tape and it is clear that Bob Zmuda did not particularly care whether he had his facts straight. But I still enjoyed the book. And Zmuda, while not precise, seems to have contributed to the understanding of Andy Kaufman."
2,it's been awhile since i read this book,"but i remember my thoughts while reading it. i came away feeling that the author (zmuda) was making a WAY bigger picture of himself than what i had ever heard before. i'm a huge andy fan and have read, watched, listened to everything andy. when i read this book, i was truly surprised how much of what i had already (known) wasn't true, according to this book. so i'm left to wonder...do i believe this book and the author of this book who claims (virtually) that he invented andy, or do i trust what my eyes and ears tell me. i'm gonna go with andy on this one. and all of the seemingly sincere reviews that support the author of this book, are, in my opinion, fake. go ahead and blast this review with your negative ratings: i'm quite sure, andy would love it if you did!"
2,Bob Zmuda pats himself on the back,"I bought this book the day it came out and read it in a day (a miracle for me). I liked the stories about Andy, but found myself annoyed almost beyond tolerance at the ""Andy and I"" prose of Bob Zmuda. He credits himself over and over for Andy's act and paints a picture of the two as inseperable comedy equals while still trying to make Andy look like his own completely original ""comic genius."" Too much Zmuda, too little Andy. Buy a video instead."
1,This book has to be Andy's greatest joke,"Here's the joke:An Andy biography that is really an auto-biography of Bob Zmuda(Who?Exactly). Well, I fell for it."
3,"Good, not always satisfying","A comparison with Bill Zehme's ""Lost in the Funhouse"" shows the weaknesses of both books. Bob Zmuda's book is a fun read, but it does give short shrift to Kaufman's formative years. (On the other hand, Zehme's account seems more speculative and given to fancy.) For being Kaufman's ""best friend and writer,"" Zmuda seems somewhat distanced from his subject, which may be the way Kaufman wanted it. Andy is a fascinating subject. Perhaps he would be best served by a video anthology of his work on video."
3,Interesting,The stuff about Kaufman is great. Unfortunatly Zmuda muddies it up by repeating again and again about what an impact he had on Andy's best bits. It's his constant love affair with himself that takes away a lot from an otherwise fascinating story.
2,a plodding read,"Don't let the title fool you...this book is as much about Bob Zmuda as Andy Kaufman, if not more so. For someone who's supposedly written for Kaufman, Dangerfield, and others, you'd think his story telling ability would be more compelling...more exciting.But it's not, and I find myself more scanning the book for Andy parts than actually reading it. Zmuda is, dare I say, just feeding off his best friend's success, trying to make us feel that he was truly an integral part of Andy's genius. I woulda believed that before reading the book...but now, well, now I'm completely indifferent. Zmuda's writing is like listening to a long-winded bore at some party you don't really want to be at.In true Kaufman fashion, however, Zmuda has the last laugh. For, no matter how good or bad this book might be, regardless, Bob's got my money.Andy would be proud."
5,Trekking poles require training for optimal use.,"Trekking poles, used optimally, can provide a complete body workout while adding strength, endurance and stability to hiking. Many people assume poles can be used intuitively. They can't. Hiking with poles is a sophisticated athletic activity that requires intense training to develop muscle memory in many muscle groups. Jayah Faye Paley has produced the only comprehensive training DVDs for using poles.""Poles for Hiking, Trekking and Walking"" demonstrates a range of skills for using poles for recreation and conditioning. ""Poles for Balance and Mobility"" provides training for those with mobility challenges. I have a PhD in backpacking and have been a Sierra Club outing leader for over 30 years. Paley's training revolutionized my hiking. Using her methods, I can hike longer and harder trails. These DVDs change peoples lives. I recommend them for anyone who walks.

5,EXCELLANT DVD,"This is a very comprehensive teaching program for the use of hiking poles and their benefits. There is so much information on how to use hiking poles correctly that my husband and I watched this DVD several times. Great tips on how to use, how not to use and the benefits of getting a full body workout. Beautiful, awesome scenery. This DVD is definitely worth purchasing if you are interested in using hiking poles correctly and getting the most benefits from them. Thank you Jayah for this excellant and helpful video."
2,Warning - Sparse Content for Nordic Walking,"This video was ripe with information on trekking and hiking with Nordic poles. However, the segment on Nordic Walking itself was very sparse in comparison. Almost an after-thought. The content was so brief in quantity (not quality) of Nordic Walking instruction, that I ended up purchasing another DVD. However, I will keep this one in case I ever decide to take up trekking or hiking."
2,size runs small,Bought size large. My cat weights 10 pounds. I was very disappointed at how small it is. Can not believe it is a size large!!!
2,Not a good purchase if your cat is declawed,"Saw a cat sack that had both back and front zipperPockets. This product is good if your cat is notDeclawed. I bought this product because myCat is very hard to handle and thought it wouldMake trimming her back paws easier, but guessWhat? No frigging back pocket zippers!"
1,Misleading,"I purchased this product because I have a cat that does not like to have his nails trimmed. I received my Cat Sack today. There is suppose to be a zipper on the underside of the sack to access the hind legs. ""This nylon sack features a quick-close collar, two-way main zipper for front or rear access, an additional underside zipper for easier rear leg access, and zippered front paw openings."" It's very disappointing that they would mislead the prospective buyer about an important feature that plays a pivotal role in deciding if this product will meet their needs."
1,It's not working!,"I bought this bag to restrain my cat for Sub-Q treatment purpose. I got the bag on time from one of the Amazon sellers at the right size; but the bag didn't work out as the other reviewers' words at all. It's extremely hard to get the cat inside the bag, and after get in, he still can roll inside the bag and pull back his legs, so the treatment cannot be performed at all!!!!!! This bag is worthless!!!!! Plus, the material is not comfortable for cats at all, too hard! We don't like it for sure."
1,Buyer beware. Company doesn't honor satisfaction guarantee,"When the cat sack made my elderly cat more agitated, I figured I would just return it. Enclosed with the product was a postcard with a satisfaction guarantee(see image above). I called the manufacturer (Four Flags Over Aspen) for a refund, and was so disappointed. The customer service rep tried to give me the run around by telling me to return the opened item to Absolutelypets. Shame on them. I can not recommended this product or company to anyone based on my experience."
1,No underside zipper as stated,"The company was not very helpful when I contacted them about receiving a Cat Sack with no underside zipper, as was stated in the description. A Cat Sack with an underside zipper does exist, but apparently, this company doesn't sell it. They blamed the description on Amazon. I don't see how Amazon would've published a description that was wrong without it somehow being the company's fault. Now I have to pay for the shipping to return this item. I am out at least $10 for the company's error. I will never order from them again."
3,Too small for my larger breed cats,"I does work fine for most breeds of cats. However, by the time the Ragdoll and Maine Coon cats are a year old, the large is way too small."
1,Really?,I didn't experience any relief. Won't bother with this again. Not much else worth saying about it. Glad it worked for others.
5,Loving this YAM cream!,This is a great product that I continue to reorder again. It has relieved my night sweats and can now enjoy a good night's sleep uninterrupted. I will continue to buy this product again and again.
5,It really works!,I've used Wild Yam Gel now for 2 or so years. My peri-menupausal symptoms are minimal. The best part is its all natural and been a proven aid for centuries.
