1,Doesn't come with everything you need!,"I just opened this product and am already irritated with it. Epson did not include a USB cable with the printer! Had I known this, I would not have bought this printer. What a hassle."
1,Horrible Product,"Have had this printer for about a year, scanner works great, printer worked great. Until now.Now it says the color cartridges are out and refuses to print in black & white without the color cartridges. Except the color cartridges aren't actually out. They're about halfway full. Wonderful.Will never buy from Epson again."
1,Trash Can Enabled,I don't know what to say - but I've bought Epson printers in the past and have good fortune with them. This one however - as other reviewers stated needs all 4 colors to be filled for it to work at all. You can only buy the cartridges from Epson now since they sued all the after marketers. A typcial price for all four colors cost over $50 now. I would not even by this printer dirt cheap - I plan to throw mine away and get another brand.
1,LAME,"This printer came free with a notebook purchase, so I am at least thankful I didn't have to pay for it. As previous reviews have stated, Epson really rips you off in the ink department. You can't print in black ink only when the color cartridges are out of ink, even if your black cartridge is FULL! And with three different color cartridges (yellow, cyan, magenta) it will cost a pretty penny to replace them all. No wonder they give it away free, that's where the profit comes from! For $50 (cheaper than replacing the color ink cartridges) I went out and bought an HP all-in-one printer brand new that comes with black and color cartridges. After my experience with the Stylus CX4200, I will not be purchasing an Epson product for the first time...lol!"
1,My Last Epson Printer,"I have purchased a number of Epson printers over the years, but this one will be the last one I buy. I bought this printer because it had different carts for the inks rather then having a single color cart and a B/W cart like my prior printers. I figured this would make it more economical to print, but it actually made it more expensive!The cost of operating this printer has been very high, the ink cart's (original Epson) have failed if I don't replace ALL of them at the same time! To add insult to the injury, the printer will refuse to print in B/W if there is no color ink. You can't even make a B/W photocopy even though there is a dedicated B/W copy button.This printer is nothing but a piece of junk and I imagine that all recent printers from Epson are the same."
1,The Most Insulting Printer Ever Made,"I can't add much more to the chorus. This Epson is not only worthless, but actually offensive to the user. This made me change from having no opinion on Epson to despising them. Great strategy, Corporate Dudes!If you would like to know what people think of it, check auction sites where these printers sell for fifteen bucks. Positive(s): at least the scanner doesn't require ink (but I bet they fixed that with the next model). What a joke."
3,Ok printer/scanner,This is a good printer/scanner when its working properly and you have ink. Its user friendly too. My first one quit working all of the sudden for no reason. It wouldn't produce any ink. My second one is starting to die as well and I just bought it this year (although it was used). The ink is pretty expensive too and it won't work unless you have ALL the colors.
1,Not economical.,"This printer ends up costing a fortune in ink. It always prints with all the colors, even if you select black only, and it does not print if any cartridge is removed or empty. It always tells me my cartridges are empty when they are not. It runs out of ink after printing about 20-30 pages of low-quality, black-only. It never seems to have ink when I need it most, which is frequently very inconvenient and has caused me to decide to buy a new printer even though technically this one is still functioning fine. Perhaps mine has some kind of problem, but I would certainly not take the risk and buy it again - nor will I be buying any Epson for my next printer if I can help it."
1,Ink ripoff,"Yup, if it wasn't for the ink glitch, I will be giving it better...Because of it, this product doesn't even deserve to have one star!"
1,Do not buy this printer.,"The printing only works when ALL the ink cartridges have ink - including pages that only require black ink. Here is how I found out:I just got a great deal on black ink for the Epson CX5400 that was clearence priced at Staples. I even bought an extra cartridge. After installing the black ink and then trying to print out a text document, I found out that the Epson company wasn't going to let me print text (black ink only) documents unless I also buy the cyan and magenta ink cartridges too. What a screw over! So I threw the Epson Stylus CX5400 in the garbage and will NEVER buy from Epson again."
3,WHY CAN'T I PRINT B&W DOCUMENTS WHEN MY COLOR CARTRIDGE IS OUT OF INK?,"My CX4200 is OK after 8 months. Just thought I'd add my 2 cents on why manufactures prevent printing when a cartridge runs dry.As print quality improves, print-head nozzles get smaller and clogging becomes a major problem on inkjet printers. If you're printing a black & white document a small amount of color inks are used to prevent clogging. Severely clogged print heads on Epson's are a PAIN while on some Canon printers ""heads"" may be replaced and on the HP you can just swap out the cartridge (heads in each cartridge). I've contacted the manufactures with the following scenario: If I print only Black & White documents how many B&W; cartridges can I go through before I have to change the color cartridges? I've NEVER gotten a response except those ""swarmy"" canned answers.I do use Epson printers for their photo quality."
5,Love it1,It's a Christmas tradition for us to attend a BE Taylor concert each season. We bought this dvd wanting to relive the experience of an inspirational concert--the dvd did not disappoint us. Thanks!! Will purchase more as gifts.
3,Would've been 5 stars but..,Got the poster in the mail had some wrinkles down the middle. Went to get the product lamenated and the wrinkles didn't come out. Disappointed due to the fact that the wrinkles where in the middle of the poster which means they where handled poorly at the warehouse and whoever shipped it could care less about the product they're selling.
4,Excellent chart for students,"We have used this as one of the primary charts for the Amma Therapy program. Clear and accurate, excellent for therapy rooms and students alike.April Crowell"
1,Does not work,I'll start with - I know how to sharpen knives. I purchased the Knive Care Kit to take care of my Wüsthof collection and I now have to take my knives to the hardware store for re-sharpening. The Wüsthof kit made my knives dull and even chipped a section out of my wonderful Chef's knife. I expected much more and ended up disappointed with somethin I can't use...
1,"If I could give it less than one star, I would....","My beautiful Grand Prix Wusthofs are the best knives that I've ever owned, and I've persuaded friends to buy them as well, just by letting them borrow one. Even the cheaper stamped Wusthofs that I had for a while are worlds better than any other knife that I had before. So why did Wusthof put their name on this damaging piece of hardware? I used it on one knife, and knew after that that it would never get near one of my knives again. It dulled it so much that I had to take it in to get professionally sharpened. Don't purchase this set! You will regret it!"
1,wusthof long term knife care kit,"Ive owned my wusthof knife set for about eight years nows, stillworks just fine for me,so I decided to add the wusthof long term knife care kit,but after reading the reviews on this set,Im sending it back.Ive always been happy with shopping amazon,and will keep shopping with amazon.It helps to read reviews from others.I did add the 7-inch hollow edge santoku knife,and a few others to complete my set.really happy with that for sure.Thanksrhonda"
5,Great TV!,This TV looks awesome even when it's not turned on. The blue ray player from my PS3 is crystal clear. It will make regular DVD's look like VHS. This is one of the best buy I've made.
2,there are better mattress pads,"I bought this at the same time I purchased an ambient pillow. The pillow is amazing and made a believer out of me.Ambient Holofiber Standard PillowI didn't start using this pad right away so I was able to see if there was a difference with just the pad. I didn't notice any benefit to the ambient feature. The pad itself is comfortable and adds a nice softness. Unfortunately, it slides around easily on my mattress so now it and my sheets won't stay put. I have to re-adjust it often and I don't like the movements while I'm sleeping. edit: I bought a non-slip rug cushion (that keeps rugs from slipping on the floor) and placed it under the pad. It has solved the slipping problem, although I do have to straighted it each week."
1,Nothing special,"I wish I could say it made a big difference in my nights sleep, but as commmon sense should have told me: it's just a plain mattress pad, nothing more nothing less. The one star rating is due to the cost, otherwise it's as comfortable as any other."
1,Bad design - slips and slides all over the bed,"I've had this mattress pad for about 6 months. I don't notice anything different about sleeping on it - no special qualities of the Hollofiber.It's very poorly designed, though. The mattress pad itself is fine. But the skirt that is supposed to hold it in place is made of a very flimsy stretchy nylon knit. The skirt does nothing to hold the mattress pad in place and it does not stay put. It bunches and moves whenever you do!Unfortunately, I bought this from another vendor who doesn't accept returns so I'm out of luck.If you like to sleep on a bunched up mattress pad and want to remake your bed a couple of times a night, this is the product for you. If you prefer a comfortable bed with a mattress pad that stays put, pass on this one."
3,Maybe too soon to tell....,"I just received the Ambient Full Matress pad and slept on it one night. It is a beautiful pad but results after one night are not great. I have lower back pain/soreness as well as the inability to sleep the entire night. I woke up during the night (as usual) and also had the same morning back pain. Possibly this will improve over time but I could not find any info.from the Ambient makers that give purchasers clues to how long it takes to get results from their products. Also, I have found that the Ambient pillows are cheaper on other websites than the Amazon Ambient pillows."
1,Holofiber hooey,"Whether this mattress pad is comfortable and improves your sleep or not, the fact is that the ""holofiber nanotechnology"" is a bunch of garbage and not worth any extra money. The only way to oxygenate your blood is by breathing (!) and the description of the ""lenses"" in the mattress pad reconfiguring wavelengths etc. makes absolutely no sense if you have any scientific understanding of biology or physics. This is not a magic mattress pad, just a normal old overpriced one."
5,god product,anyone looking for a cheap good splitter this is it. Very well made and does great! I highly recommend to others!!
4,Five Hundred Answers to Bee Questions,Got a lot of questions answered for an older book on beekeeping. Somethings never change when it comes to nature. Good information.
4,Easy as pie,"I bought these to install some nice hooks in our kitchen so my wife would have some hanging fruit baskets. I didn't want something ""industrial"" looking, so I was attracted to the antique brass hook.The hook took about 5 minutes to install with a basic drill. it came with toggle bolts, so screwing it in tight was a snap. The swivel piece then slides right in and drops into place.Yes, a little more expensive than a plain hook, but they look great and the swivel option means the chains on the basket don't get tangled."
4,"Too much melodica..>! But, a great recording nonetheless...","I found it to be a recording that runs together.... Not much stands out....Until one plays the songs in a shuffle with other albums. Then one hears the fact that each song is good, some are great..... The melodica track from one song plays through too many tracks, but I love the CD.The packaging of the version I picked up in Europe is a book, no jewel case, very beautiful. That was what drew me, besides the fact that anything from SeneMaliGambia is worth a try, IMHO>...."
3,Where IS Mali anyway?,"Ok, I guess it's in Africa, but it doesn't matter anyway. I stereotype World music into one category: Boring. That said, this album isn't world music in my opinion... At least the part of the album I am interested in. The good bits in this album reek of Albarn's trademark touch, and simply represent a continuation of his incredible talent for creating moody melodies that embrace instruments other than the guitar. I loved the ""Ravenous"" soundtrack with Nyman, and I hear a nice amalgamation of that and Gorillaz in this album."
5,umm good... no need to say more.,"yes I think this is a darn good piece of work. I think you should throw away the reasons for Albarn doing this record and just add this to his career in being a part of some of the best music to come out in the last 10 years. I can't give him all the credit for this album the other memebers of this artful work fill in their roles nicely. This album has a vibe that is probably unmatched in the year of 2002. its good, probably better than good, ok, it's better than good, but no need to bog it down with silly sayings. it has great instrumentation and a wonderful feel along with glorious texture to it. done."
4,Nice angle on world music,"I like this album a lot. I first heard the song ""Sunset coming on"" off a compilation CD. The music should be considered world music but not in the vain that they try in push all the musical culture of Mali through your head in 12 songs. It flows nice and varied as any album should in my mind. If you like world music with a new twist then you should enjoy this CD."
4,Mali Falcon,"Two years ago Albarn leaved for a country with population ten times less than his albums sold. Where Niger flows and scorching Kharmatan blows. Himself! Hats off!Note that Mali music attracts foreigh perfomers as a merry-go-round. Eminent Taj Mahal has released corresponding album three years ago; and Toumani Diabate was there, here and everywhere.From all brit-pop stars DA is more sober-minded, but light on his feet: Gorrillaz, Island electronica, Blur sound experiments and Afrika now.It is understanded that more Damon's music IT IS, rather than Bamako city's as a result of his trips, plays and records.First six seconds sound like Salvatore Adamo, but after certain special electronic effects all adamisms desappear. Less authentic, but good. Saxophone, violin, electro-guitars, melodic, kalimba, etc. even griots are there.And last, but no least photo of Damon himself in alboms's booklet. You have to own it!"
3,"good, but not great quality","The fire truck was very easy to put together, and moves and turns well, my 1 year old and my 5 year old love it. If you are looking for an heirloom toy, then don't buy this truck, the fenders, grill, steering wheel etc are all cheap plastic and look like they will break down in no time. However if you are looking for a fun relatively inexpensive toy, that probably won't last for generations or rough play , then this is the toy for you."
4,Very Cute!,"I got this fire truck for my son when he was 18 months old and he thought it was great! It is alittle difficult to put together so you'll want to make sure you have time to put it all together. It is also very heavy. Which is good that it won't tip over, but being very heavy also makes its hard for my son to turn when he is sitting on it. It is very cute and shiny and the little bell on the front works. Now that my son is 2 he still can't manage to turn it very well and gets frustrated with it even though he will still sit on it and play with it. Overall though, I'm not sure I would buy it again."
3,Not As Pictured,"The picture in the ad (with the silver rounded handles in the back) is of the current design but what I received is the old design (no handles, where the ladders just hang from hooks & are not bolted, with a black hose, ex:[...] ). This was very disappointing. We received this as a gift and my husband had already put most of it together before we realized this. Without the handles & the ladders being bolted to the truck there is a risk of the ladders getting lost & our baby possibly hurting himself if the ladders come off while he is trying to push it. The added hose is very nice & will be good for play but the loss of the look & safety of the silver handles is not worth it. Also, the steering wheel looks cheaply made & the seat is hard plastic (was hoping for a leather padded one for the price). Over all it is still very cute & our baby loves it, but I worry about him playing with it when he gets a little older."
1,Schylling Metal Speedster Fire Truck,this fire engine came not put together - i plan to return it after the holiday - very disappointing to my 2 year old grandson - we opened the box and could not believe it was not ready to ride. No notice given on the box or invoice.Shame on you!!Eileen Varriale
1,Packing Error,"I ordered this fire truck for a Christmas gift and was really excited to assemble it for my nephew. Unfortunately, two major parts (891.005 & 891.006) needed to attach the rear axle and anchor the steering wheel were missing from the packaging. The truck is fulfilled from TJD Toys so Amazon was unable to exchange the item as they usually do. I'll end up scrambling to find something like it locally tomorrow morning (Christmas Eve) or getting the truck replaced after the holiday. Either way, it's a really disappointing experience as this is the first Christmas my nephew is old enough to open gifts on his own."
1,Very bad WWII Chronicles,"Horrible set. A waste of money. Coverage of the conflict is very simple, and most of the content related only to the American intervention. Very bad image reproduction."
5,Breyer horses,The child was thrilled with Misty and Stormy and parents will read the book to her no more words anyway
5,Great for kids who love horses,My daughter really enjoys reading the story especially since we live so close to the location. She also loves playing with the horses acting out the story.
3,Jazzy Horns,"This is NOT bossa nova. This is 95% jazz - heavy on the horn section - 5% Bossa Nova. That is, bossa nova that is submerged under the horns. These are all good musicians coming from McCoy Tyner's band, the Yellow Jackets and other quality ensembles. Very progressive jazz is what you get."
3,"Great pictures, but a tad weak on details.","Excellent, excellent pictoral history of the NHL. Not much depth in writing, but it does give you a glimpse of how the NHL arrived to where it is today.Would be a great coffee table book to have sitting around. It is a blast to thumb through."
3,Missing Very Little,"Mario is Missing, and it's up to you and Luigi to find him. Play the game as Luigi and friends, venturing through Italy's Colosseum, Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel, and more in this educational game from THE SOFTWARE TOOLWORKS.I believe that it is very important for children of ALL ages to learn about history, and I believe that this game does just that. You travel to many historic places around the world, attempting to find clues as to where Mario has been taken by the Koopa King himself, Bowser.Though the graphics are minimal, I think that they are right for the game. They do not distract you from the plot and storyline.. thus perfect for kids of 7+, all the way to adults. It is perfect for these ages because you can change different aspects of the game based on your age and comprehension level.I would recommend this game to anyone with children."
2,oh heck no!,"child's reviewlet me just say this; nobody likes an educational mario game!i mean this is just like mario's time machine, you have to go around the word collecting artifacts from the past.these artifacts will help you get closer to finding mario. for a game thats supposed to teach you something this sure is stupid.even the title art is stupid, i mean, Luigi look behind youit kills me to say this; but this time mario should stay missing"
3,"Old, but very functional for young child","I bought this specifically for my seven year old to use. It was a used item but in great shape. The software that was pre-loaded on it was worth far more than what I paid for the used laptop! Wasn't wireless capable, so that was a slight drawback."
4,Chicachatta,"Woodworth is a first-rate writer with an impressive command of the material. The campaign is complicated one and he deals with it well, although not in the detail that Peter Cozzens offers in his landmark books. I have two quibbles: There is no map with the Chickamauga chapter, a battle of mind-bending complexity. Also, Woodworth deals very lightly with Gen. John B. Turchin, surely one of the war's most colorful characters"
4,Much better than I expected,"When a Civil War historian names his son Nathan you would expect a one sided biased account. However, Woodworth is surprisingly even handed in his treatment of the six armies that fought over Chattanooga. He is at his best in describing the backbiting in the southern leadership and the incompetence of Longstreet. This is a thin book. Perhaps too thin for those who would like a little more detail. We still await an indepth look at the Tennesseans who fought for the north."
1,Wrong on Bragg and Wrong on Longstreet,"Ugh. Another rehash of the generals under Bragg should have listened to him. Bragg got a huge help in the arrival of General Longstreet, who broke through the Union right, and would have demolished or captured the entire right wing (and maybe the left) if he got the reinforcements he asked Bragg for after the breakthrough. Bragg did not listen, and lost the Chattanooga campaign because of it. Nothing new in this stuck on incorrect Lost Cause thinking about Bragg."
5,Chickamauga and Chattanooga,"Chickamauga is a Confederate victory, a Pyrrhic one. The Chattanooga was a triumph for Grant and Sherman. When the pros from the west, Grant and Sherman ,came in after Chickamauga the south ran away in the end."
3,Good performances. So-so sound.,This CD captures Maurice Chevalier in his prime. I suspect it comes from tracks laid down in the 1940's. It's apparent someone made a serious effort to do a good job of restoration. But still the sound is not up to recordings made in the mid-1950's and later. For diehard Maurice Chevalier fans only.
3,"Works fine, but annoying to use","I bought this to cover ourBaby Jogger 2010 City Mini Double Stroller, Green/Grey, because I didn't want to spend anther fortune for Baby Jogger's mosquito netting, and this netting is advertised as working with most double strollers. The price is right, and it does it's job. However, it is minorly annoying that it has to cover the stroller's handle to work. Also, there are several spaces that are not fully covered by the netting, although the mosquitos do not seem to have figured this out yet. The most annoying part is that it is so loose that my toddler can easily grab it and tug on it, making it quite difficult to keep on. If your toddler is more sedate than mine, this might not be a problem."
3,I thought I was buying Angel Innocent - oops,"I like the smell of Angel Innocent better, but the regular Angel is okay, it's kind-of musky."
4,Yum,Loved the smell on my cousin so I had to try it on myself and see how it worked with my pheromones.
2,Very difficult puzzle.,"This is a beautiful puzzle but very challenging. The colors are not distinct enough to distinguish which pieces go where. Having put many puzzles together before this, this one has been the hardest ever. You can sit for an hour and only find a few pieces. Yes,it is that difficult. It is a large puzzle so be prepared to have a large working area occupied for a good length of time. The pieces do fit well together but do not fit as you might expect. The shapes are very different. If you want a challenge then this is the puzzle for you."
5,Truth in advertising,"The mistake a lot of people make when approaching these kinds of discs is that since they don't use ""complete"" works they're somehow less authentic. There's certainly a lot of merit in sitting in concentrated listening to a ""serious"" piece of music, but there's really nothing wrong with using music to accent a mood. Background music is great!So, strip away all attempts at pretension and you're left with exactly what you have here--the ideal accompaniment to a crisp early morning walk through the woods. I know because that's exactly how I used this a few days ago. The music brings out the beauty in your surroundings, and vice versa."
4,Good for a Fall Afternoon,A pretty good compilation of music for a fall afternoon. I wish there were more.
4,Combo,"The Guitar Amplifier combo from Behringer is a very good buy, from the perspective of the Valve amplifier in the Vintager Pack.The Amp sounds great, very loud from a very small amp.Great Tube resonnance and sweet harmonics. The guitar is a little mundane in comparison, yet another strat type copy.If you like Fenders you will like the guitar. I found other guitars sound better with the Amp.The sound was a little thin from the Behringer Vintager guitar. A guitar with twin humbuckers through the Amp is absolutely classic Heavy Metal.From a purchasing perspective overall its worth it just for the Amplifier."
4,Stylish little organizer,"While the drawers' flexi construction took me a little by surprise, it fits nicely into the limited space that I had for a unit and enables me to fit 2 pairs of shoes in a drawer--great depth! If you're looking for something that will have heavy-duty wear and tear, look elsewhere, but for my purposes, this is pretty perfect."
4,Chop Shop,I like the book. I am having a hard time understanding some of it but the more times I read it the better I get it!!
3,"The Ultimate Board,","I have owned several different types of BBoards. This one is the finest EVER produced. Its shaped like no other board, wide and stiff. Handles big surf with confidence and speeds you out of the pit in Safety.This board ripps. Depending on on your style, conditions at your local break and preference in tails. This board is stiff and takes off like a rocket. As soon as you drop in your gone. I am a larger rider? 205lbs and 6'. It works for me. Because it is stiff it does not rotate as well for spinners like a non-stringer board. ITs really fast and will rip the top off on rollos and cut backs. Jarring ride. The hand grips on the front are the best.If your serious about riding big waves, get this stick. Its the most real BB ever produced. Worth the bucks."
3,OK product,"Did not see any dramatic difference in skin tone after start using this product, but again I have a very tight, smooth skin to start with. Also maybe it just does not ""click"" with my skin type."
4,Restful and relaxing,"Heard this CD at a Japanese Zen Tea Garden and found it on Amazon. We weren't disappointed. It's unusual music, very restful and relaxing."
2,Comfortable and Entertaining,Using this slumber bag duffel is comfortable and entertaining . My son love it very much ...
4,it's a nice cd,"yeah, just nice. nothing incredible, but no bad songs either, and some cool guest features. The one thing I didn't really feel were the hooks on this cd. He'd have a perfectly good song and then he'd mess it up with some random hook. Oh, and skip that song with Wyclef. But it's good."
4,Westside Gold,"What can I say, but DJ Quik has done it again. This CD has tight beats and features many great artist. A must for any persons collection."
3,CD review Verdi / Price,It is a classic recording. Unfortunately the technical quality is a little outdated. This is the reason for my rating.
2,"fantastic singing, shame about the camerwork","This is an example of what happens when the enthusiasm of the director gets in the way of the art. A simple basic rule of filming singers is that the camera stays on the singer all the time they are singing. On this dvd Henri-Georges Clouzot constantly moves the camera off the singers half-way through the phrase. It's distracting and makes it impossible to focus properly on the music. Given that in this instance the singers include at least two of the greatest of the great, it's particularly distressing."
5,RIP Luciano Pavarotti,"I watched this 40-year old performance in honor of Luciano Pavarotti, who sings the tenor role. He looks young and is thinner and clean-shaven.The performance is an amazing spectacle and Leontyne Price and Nikolai Ghiaurov are particularly wonderful.Rest in peace, Luciano!"
5,Impressive,"Seeing the life of this women in the book is incredible, seeing a daily basis of what she encountered and how she faced it is amazing."
4,My review of the book,"The book is very descriptive and direct in its dialoge. The book is written well and the story follows through the whole book. It's about a 18 year old girl, named Jennifer, whose best friend is accused of the crime of killing her own mother. Jennifer sets out to hire a private investegator to help her discover the true criminal behind the case. The only thing is, she has to prove it to the police in time before her friend is convicted of the crime."
5,A real suspence!,"This book was an awsome book. I could not put it down. It gave me the chills after reading it. It was a good paced plot, and the ending was a little weak, but it was still a thriller you will want to read over and over again. I recomend this book to everyone. even adults. It will keep you guesting until the end. It is one of the most bone-chilling books you will ever read."
4,Great Mystery!!!,"This is a great and very exciting book. Very trilling, and exciting mystery book~ Better read it"
1,The WORST,"This book is the worst because first all the books i've read, the main characters all have boyfriends. Secondly, the characters i've read so far are girls. Thirdly this book looks so old because it didn't actually have the same look as the two other books i read which were The Weekend was Murder and A Candidate for Murder."
4,chris smither CD,"Great guitar player, singer and songwriter. Some of his stuff is kind of repetitive, but most of it is lovely."
3,Video Quality of Harley Show No Match For Their Bikes,"The VHS jacket states ""Official Licensed Product."" So this must be the true story. Believe me, the content is wonderful and should be of great interest to all Harley entusiasts. In fact, this 73-minute version is a director's cut, totally re-edited and much improved from the 50-minute prequel or sequel that aired on TBS in the early 1990's. Content should get five stars.The three-star rating is the result of ""Quality Duplicaton in Extended Play Mode"" (direct quote from the jacket). EP (6-hour) speed, not 4-hour LP or really good 2-hour SP, but the bottom of the barrel ... and the enjoyment level suffers from it. Why Cabin Fever, the releasing company, took a great show and turned out horrific dupes to save a few cents in tape costs is beyond me. However, if you do not mind watching through the generally marginal picture quality and episodes of tracking error, it is definitely a worthwhile video."
2,Not the best Dibdin,"I like this author. This book I don't like or dislike, and that's a problem. It did not make much of an impression. The plot is standard conspiracy stuff, and while there are highly literate moments and great insights, they are fewer than in other books. I think the author is tired. I was, after reading this. Pick up an earlier work to see the heights Dibdin can achieve."
5,An excellent addition to the Zen mysteries,Medusa is an excellent addition to the Aurelio Zen mysteries. A faster pace than some of the others but a rich story in this brilliant series that takes us through the heart and soul of Italy. May there be many more to come.
1,Not Always in Style,"This book was very disappointing. The advice is ridged and out dated. I found much better advice in a few magazines rather than this supposed ""expert' expressed. If you want to find up to date and cutting edge fashion advice read a magazine and save your money on this."
5,Premiere,Yes Premiere is now known as Honey Luv you can check them out at www.honeyluv.com and their official fan club is www.groups.yahoo.com/group/honeyluv
2,NOT Tony Hillerman,"I have read every word Tony Hillerman has written because he has the ability to develop characters and tell his story without the use of obscene and/or foul language. I am reading ""Stolen Gods"" for a class on mystery writing and find the subject and plot development to be very interesting, however, the liberal sprinkling of obscenities is so distasteful to me that I am finding it difficult to continue reading. I look forward to other reviews to learn how this book is rated by other readers. Thanks Amazon!"
4,Good eye cream,"Although expensive, this cream last for MONTHS and I use it daily. I have noticed much younger-looking skin around my eyes since using it, and using it together with an anti-puffing gel around my eyes, I look vibrant and young. I love this product!"
3,"Nice strap, however","Comfy, looks great. Be mindful, the strap fits very loose on the strap nuts of the guitar. Not very secure. Can easly come loose. I bought a fender patchworks strap along with this and the fender strap holds secure."
5,Gibson strap,"This strap is well worth the money, looks real nice with my les paul and very soft and comfortable around the shoulder. Very quick and reliable service from the seller."
1,Falls Short w/ potential for greatness,"Jessem generally makes great ""stuff"". They blew it here, especially for the price. It is hit and miss as to the quality of unit you will receive. Unfortunately the tolerance / attachment method on the miter attachment portion (changing angles) is NOT very good. The unit purchased from Rockler had so much play in it, that it would not maintain any semblence of accuracy with setting an angle. Jessem or Rockler were of no help except that I would have to dis-assemble and send the whole unit back.That brought up the assembly ........ cumbersome and time-consuming at best, not to mention having to essentially destroy your table saw; and, commit to ALWAYS having to use this.I've actually gone back to using the Incra universal sled with a Jessem Miter Excel hooked in ...... cheaper and works a whole lot better.Jessem needs to totally re-design this thing.Oh yah, and it takes a tremendous amount of patience-grabbing time to adjust this thing so it ""works""."
2,Difficult to align,"I purchased this unit two years ago hoping that it would be accurate and it did not appear to take up a lot of space since I have all of my tools on mobile bases in my garage. It is substantially built, but I have spent hours trying to get it to cut accurately. Overall I have been very dissapointed with this expensive assessory. My biesemeyer fence is spot on and my table is correctly aligned with the blade. I have not used this cross cut table to cut a piece of wood, other than trying to get it aligned. Not only do I not use this device, but I can not cut on the left side of the saw blade because I had to cut off the fence rails to install the mast-r-slide."
3,"Advanced programmers should by a ""faster"" book","I have found this a between bad and reasonable good book.I have already a few years actionscript-experience and was looking for a book that could help me in the ""whats new departement"". Actually it has helped me to find out what is new in AS2.0 however the book is to slow for me (and I haven't done the actual lessons, I have only read it) What I mean is that when you have some actionscript experience I think you are better off buying another more advanced book (like object-oriented Actionscript) that helps in the ""whats new departement"" while you reading it without loosing time on endless explanations of things that speak for itself.In this book there is one chapter on Object-oriented-programming (which by the way I found to be interesting). So again if you feel up to moving your programming to OOP than don't buy this book.If you have no or very little experience with AS : buy it, its written for you!"
2,Unnecessary book for the experienced user,"If you already have some experience with ActionScript this book won't teach you the fundamentals of AS 2.0. The examples are boring and the way they are programmed is rather poor. Don't expect to go through all the magic and efficiency of AS 2.0. The best you can get from this book is picking some intersting advices sometimes, but it's definetly not worth the price. The only piece of code beautifully written is the chat server class written by Makar, and you can easily download it on his website ;)"
2,Not a brilliant book,"I baught this book hoping that it would be an guide,overview and dictionary of AS2.0 in the same way that ""Actionscript for Flash MX. The Definitive Guide"" was for Flash MX.After paying and reading this book from cover to cover, I was very dissapointed with it's depth. It doesn't even touch on extending current static classes, most of the examples are just excuses to use what you have just learned and don't really have any real world application and most of the content is more about the application than about the actionscript behind it.I was hoping that this book would be an offset for Macromedia's hopeless documentation, but alas it wasn't. It's probably good for first time flash users, but I'll be waiting for something from Colin Mook now."
1,"Waste of time, effort and money","I bought the book thinking it would be a great resource for actionscript, but I can not even get through the first project. The exercise is not explained well, and it has some inherent internal problems.I tried to contact the author via his online forum, but to my surprise the author had not personally answered one question, and he wrote the book; needless to say that was a bust.All-in-all, I do not suggest buying this book as it is a waste of time, effort and money"
2,No Flow to the Material whatsoever,"I bought this book for a flash course I am taking. I have been programming for over 8 years, and I still found this book extremely difficult to follow.This book comes with a CD with several graphics, and the author takes you step by step on exercises to perform with those specific graphics. I didn't follow ""exactly"" what the author wanted me to implement with the his/her graphics on the CD the book comes with, but why should I have to?? I wanted to work towards implementing what I'm learning towards MY own site, not his/hers. I thought I could follow the book and see how to easily add animation, behaviors, drop down menus etc. I found that the author jumps totally off course from chapter to chapter, you find yourself flipping back to previous chapters all the time, trying to decipher what the author is trying to get across.I just think this book flows very poorly. I would look at other books on Flash before purchasing this one."
4,"Pretty Good, but better if you have the Professional version","I'm not a beginner, so it's hard for me to judge if one can become proficient in ActionScripting through this book. But it has been a useful reference for me as one moving from ActionScript 1.0 to 2.0.What I would like to highlight is that while the book in the introduction claims that it is useful for both the Standard and Professional version of Flash, I personally find that the user will gain more using the Professional version. A Standard version user may get pretty frustrated as early as the 1st chapter when they are asked to create a .as file, without being told that you can't open .as files in the Standard version. This is perhaps the greatest flaw in this otherwise decent book."
5,great screen,"This is a great screen to use for manual focus. Hardly any difference in exposure, works like a charm. Attaching the screen is easy to do."
5,Great Insight for Current & Future Leaders,"I was very impressed by this book. It's a pretty quick read, but it hammers home the key aspects of leadership using a forgotten source - the Civil War. I was surprised at the parallels that can be drawn from situations 150 years apart, but the key requirements for success in the new internet economy: speed, decisiveness, use of technology, changing the rules, etc., are even better understood by giving them a little space from current affairs and comparing them to mid-1800s history. This is a great book to give to a management team of a startup or a big organization alike - it's as inspiring as it is educational."
1,Historical Stretch,"Tom Wheeler applies American Civil War history to modern day business practices. The results are interesting. The basic conscepts about leadership, teamwork and risk-taking can be applied to business challenges. Some of the examples are taken out of context. For instance General Jubal Early is honored for his risk-taking as he galloped toward Washington and created panic within the citizens and army. That event was the high point in Early's career. He was a miserable failure throughout the remainder of the war. That's the challenge of such a book, finding historical figures that consistently made the right decisions. Wheeler's book provides interesting reading and it may be especially valuable to readers with limited understanding of the Civil War."
2,"Long on History, Short on Business Strategy","Mr. Wheeler is an obvious history buff on America's Civil War and a particular fan of the South. However, in his attempt to marry his love of war history with lessons for business management, he scores few victories. The structure of the book is to review a war general's strategy and use it to emphasize a particular point he is trying to make regarding strategy. However, he fails to tie it in effectively with the then business world analogy he tries to conclude each chapter with. The reader is then left scratching one's head wondering how one can employ this in one's business which, after all, is what one is supposed to be taking from this book in the first place."
2,No Divx subtitle support is BIG LETDOWN,"I have the Lite-On LVD-2001 and now this Norcent DP-220. I mainly watch Korean, Taiwanese, and Chinese Dramas and the fact that it doesn't support divx subtitles is a big reason not to get this if you're planning to watch foreign films/dramas. I bought this at Fry's and now it's going back to Fry's. My Lite-On does subtitles and I know the Philips also does subtitles so I'm gonna give the Philips a try. This player also skips and freezes a lot on the Xvids videos that I had but the Lite-On didn't have a problem w/ it but my Lite-On freezes on Divx 3.11 so I was hoping to get a player to played both dvix and xvid w/o any problems. Hopefully the Philips will solve this problem or else I'll stick to using the TV-Out option on my computer for Divx 3.11 files."
5,Better than my $180 Panasonic DVD player,"I have Panasonic Progressive scan DVD player which I paid ~$180 about 3 years ago. It had no problem paying burn DVD with Sony burner, but I started to have issue with DVD+-R burn with cheap Emplex (bought the burner for $39). I was looking at various player and this one caught my eye. Playing DVD and Divx!!! for $25 !!! So I went and bought one about 3 hours ago (sorry not from Amazon.com, but from local computer super store). Amazing! this player plays everything that I put it in! What's more cool is that if you burn multiple Divx movie in one DVD, you can select movies that you want to play! No need to burn each CD for each Divx movie.Only thing I don't like about this player is that it has no front face LCD indicator...."
1,Worthless piece of sh**,"You get what you pay for. I gambled and lost. You don't have to repeat my mistake if you don't want to. It worked OK for a month and than began stopping, starting, stopping again, starting again, stopping and not starting.Oh well...fifty bucks down the drain"
1,Good while it lasted,"Got this player for the bedroom a month or so after getting a Philips DVP642. Norcent worked fine for about a year then it started freezing up where the only solution was to unplug it (couldn't even get the disc out). Now it doesn't read anything at all, not even music CD's. My Philips continues to work great."
1,not a reliable player,"About six months into using this player, it started freezing during dvd playback. Now, it is junk. Picture quality was great when it was working. I would not recommend it."
2,Doesn't support DTS,"This player doesn't support DTS sorround sound. Even the cheapest DVD player supports it but not this one. which is kind of odd. If you don't care that feature, this is a good player"
1,NO DTS !!!!,Plays 80% of the Divx stuff I have downloaded from the internet. Some stuff just doesn't play.. can't figure out why.The worst part is that it doesn't support DTS ??? What the heck. My 3 year old CHEAP DVD player supports DTS... but this one doesn't. Ugh... I have to give 1 star due to the DTS feature.
1,Defective Merchandise,I ordered with high hopes given the positive reviews at Amazon but when I set it up I found the door would not open. So I am sending it back dissapointed.
1,Never received Product,I never recieved this Product. It was sent to the shipper broken and damaged and leaking out of the box. The shipper called me to tell me and i told them to send the Product back to the Company. I never received an apology from the Company or a credit until i stopped payment on my cREDIT cARD. sTAY AWAY FROM THIS cOMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Good singing, shame about the visuals","I bought this opera because it has Italian subtitles, 10 points here. Its great to be able to follow the singing. I thought the singing was really good, clear, and there were nuances that I had'nt heard before. I've seen and heard Figaro many times so this was good. Orchestra is great too. The big problem with this one was the visuals. They are pretty poor. The film quality is poor, and the stage minimalist. Unfortunately Brian Terfel as Figaro ends up looking like a smurf in a nappy, with a strangely contorted face. The whole set along with the cast looks like a cheap cartoon. I'll have to watch it more to to hope it grows on me. This is a pity because there is alot of emotional content to Figaro and the ludicrous set/makeup/costumes means this production loses the emotive force that in other Figaro's have brought me to tears."
2,"As a whole, Well...","Singing is good but the picture ( settings rather empty and over-simplified ) is not as good and the orchestra is not so good. The tempo as a whole is fast, particularly the overture. Yes, the audience then preferred a faster pace, but certainly not rushing.The orchestra was not supportting the singer(s): outpacing or else eclipsing the singers here and there--few conductors except Toscanini would perfer such a tempo. The odd accentuations added by the conductor totally failed to dramatize but were quite enough to scare the comfort and peace of the audience off. There is little drama, nor poetry, nor lyricism. The whole opera is chopped up into pieces. One gets the feeling that this is just a rehearsal instead of any serious performance save and except some great individual singings. The result: it sounds a mixture of Mozart's metal-scraping giggling and the noble music he promised us!"
2,Very disappointed,"I sold it for half of what I spent the second day after I watched this DVD because I was expecting a better performance when I saw all actors/actresses wearing old-fashioned costumes on the cover of the disc. However, all the soloists, except Rodney Gilfry (Count Almaviva), are just too annoying in the whole play. I wish DG would release James Levine's Metropolitan version sometime."
5,Mozart's Marriage is Magnificent,"I've been a lover of this opera ever since I heard it for the first time about 15 years ago. I bought a CD version, made cassette tapes for my car and must have listened to it at least 40 or 50 times before the tape broke. I've never seen a staged version of it and this is my first purchase of any opera on DVD. I was very pleased in spite of some of the adverse reviews about this version available on Amazon.The staging is sparse but does not detract from the overall dramatic effect. The singing is luscious and the acting is absolutely sensual. I was in tears with delight and passion at many points and will watch it for many years to come.Thank you Mozart."
2,100% in TAB,"This mandolin method has a pretty impressive reputation if you look for comments about it here and there, but it's hard for me to understand why.The entire thing is in TAB, no standard notation whatsoever. It actually gets pretty advanced, which is kinda funny: you'd think if the student were serious enough to study at this level, he'd have the patience to learn standard notation so as to increase versatility with scales, modes, etc.Certainly the most advanced TAB-based method I'm aware of."
5,Great book for beginners!,Awesome book that is used by my mandolin teacher. The CD's that come with the book are a really big help after you go home from your lesson!
2,Did not receive both disks,"I ordered this for my father, and according to him, there was only one disk in the package. Very disappointing. He didn't want to bother with sending it back."
1,The description is labeled wrong,Dorman OE Solutions 741-640 Oldsmobile/Pontiac Front Driver Side Power Window Regulator with Motor.....this is for the passenger side window....item 741-643 is for the drivers side. Very upset to have taken my door apart all together and try to put this in the drivers side...just to have to put the old one back in because it was wrong item.
5,Quality replacement,"Dorman makes good quality replacement parts. This was quick and easy to replace. No problems with the product. My son says the driver side door is going now, so we will be getting another one soon..."
5,Outstanding,"Excellent reading for serious students of Lutheran theology/doctrine.Layout is excellent, with translation of German text opposite that of the Latin. Footnoted material provides additional historical material.A great read!"
4,Lutheran Book of Concord,"I find this book to be an excellent reference for Bible studies and learning more about Martin Luther. The book contains Luther's small and large catechism which defines in detail the meaning of The Lords Prayer, The Ten Commandments, and the various Creeds of the Lutheran Church."
4,required reading,Book is on the heavy side but has much information in it. The type could be a little bit bigger to make it easier to read but if that happened the book would be even heavier.
2,Read it at home but don't use as a guidebook,"This is a well-written book with a lot of interesting information about history, flora & fauna, local culture and cuisine, etc. It is this background information that Davies and Cole excel at. I would recommend reading this book before undertaking the Camino de Santiago, but I would not recommend it as a guidebook to carry with you. I felt like I was ""walking blind"" with this guide.The book does not include maps, only very rough sketches with lines before cities. It offers no help in keeping you on the trail, should you lose the waymarkers. The elevation charts likewise are very basic and not very accurate. There is very scant information about albergues and accommodation options, and they are not clearly marked on the sketch ""maps""."
3,basic guide,Basic guide for use on model if you have a standard . Any upgrades and manual really is no help.
3,It'l do,"I've never been a fan of reverse engineered automotive manuals. That being said it does make a nice companion to a factory manual, because of the actual photographs. Although Haynes manuals are geared to weekend hobby ""mechanics"" they can still get you in over your head if you do not have a bit of experience with the car you are working on to begin with.My recommendation? Skip this one and go for a Factory Manual, then perhaps reconsider the Haynes Manuals later for the pictures."
4,Nice stuff,"If you are into watching beautiful women smoke cigars, then this is a nice video to own. 1 of the 3 women doesn't exactly look like she's enjoying it, as she turns green about half way through her shoot on the leather couch. LOL. But, a nice adult video to have if you, or you and a loved one, enjoy playing around with a cigar together."
2,Arguably the best film ever on naked ladies smoking cigars,"This is sort of a strange sideshow act, featuring three models who light up and peel off. Who thinks of these things? The pretense of educational content - that is real information about cigars - is about as scanty as the leading ladies' lingerie."
3,Pleasurable Time with this video!,"My girlfriend and I usually cuddle by the fire place (nude) exchange kisses and of course smoke cigars while watching the movie, it is great."
4,I REVIEVEWED IT! LiSTEN UP!,"Go across the lands of COLORADO. Just hike, boat, climb or ski. This book has it all, JUST READ IT!"
2,Be Careful!!,"this is not a remaster of the old hits. it is the old guys trying to recreate some of their hits and it doesn't work at all. they really can't reach the notes and the harmony is way off. don't buy this cd!!! if you went to a country fair that said the delfonics will be there, this cd is what you will hear."
1,The audio quality of this CD is horrible,I am a Delfonics fan but I did not recognize the Delfonics on this CD. That's how bad the audio quality is. Horrible.
3,Can't Knock A Guy (or Group) For Trying!,"The Delfonic's Thom Bell produced, Philly Groove label sounds are decades long since passed here. If seeking to hear that level of great music, one must seek elsewhere. That being said, as a Delfonics fan, the purchase of this cd was a foregone conclusion. I found it interesting enough not to discard. It would be nice to see if there could be a ""reunion"" album produced by Thom Bell, using real piano, drums, etc. William has enough left to help pull it off."
1,fool me once......,this shipment really made me feel ripped off. this is not EVEN the original delfonics (with eddie holman). it isn't even a good remake of these tunes. very dissapointing.
4,Excellent,"This is a amazing piece of software. If you have the right hardware, this software will do whatever you need it to do."
1,Poorly written book - very disappointing,"I purchased this book and was anxious to read it but I must say I was very disappointed. The book contains an appendix which is just a report issued by the Pentagon to Congress regarding the Chinese military. The report is interesting - but anyone can download it for free from the DOD website. Wasted pages to make the book seem more substantial than it really is.The various war scenarios with China are very poorly written and somewhat juvenile. Imagine a bad made-for-TV movie and you will get a good idea of what this book is like.People can debate about whether or not China really wants war with the United States, but this book is not the one to start the discussion.Don't waste your time on this one!"
1,Sensationalism and scare tactics to feed paranoia,"This whole scenario seems highly unlikely. The USA seems much more likely to escalate a military conflict than the Chinese are. The Chinese are already cleaning our clock economically, why should they resort to military tactics? It's not in their best interests. The economic battle is being won by the Chinese. That is where we need to focus our efforts."
2,Wrong way to compete,The Chinese economy is growing. Our economy is sliding. We have a crumbling primary school education system that performs poorly. Our prison population is exploding. The institution of marriage is falling apart thanks to insane divorce laws. And our currency stands at the brink of a meltdown.The only way we can compete on the international scene is to get our own house in order and create jobs. Not bomb everyone that acts against 'our interests'. Should we start bombing Venezuela if they decide to sell oil to China instead of the US? Is Taiwan really worth starting a global thermo nuclear war? China taking over Taiwan will be much like China taking over Hong Kong. China's incentive will be to keep their economy moving. This book is xenophobia to the extreme.
2,Where's the Money?,"The authors present some interesting scenarios that may interest wargamers (and cause chuckles among those who do not admire HR Clinton), but as incisive analysis, the book fails badly. We are told that China is spending billions on high-tech weapons, but so are we! However, the main failing is the total lack of any reference to America's huge debt to the PRC, something now over 500 Billion dollars. If readers are to believe in some impending US-China war, they need to know why China would go to war with a nation that owes Beijing such an immense sum. In failing even to acknowledge that question, the authors prove themselves lacking as analysts. One also has to wonder how the publisher allowed so vital an omission to proceed in such a book."
1,Education please,uhhh... That's all I can say about this bookWhich country overthrew the most sovereign countries in the last century? And which country overthrew no country essentially in its history?The Chinese aggression. wow.The biggest build-up since Nazi Germany? Very subtle association. Too bad history can't even make comparisons with US's build-up with another enclave of humans
1,Awful,"The seams were coming apart, tiny holes, looked crooked and blew over in 24 hours. The only thing going for it was the hex shape. Do NOT buy this gazebo."
5,Simply spectacular,"This is a spectacular production in every way. Not only is it well sung and well acted out, the sets are also marvellous and the direction is excellent. Brian Large's videography is exemplary. Both the picture and sound qualities are good. (I've heard from friends that it's a significant improvement from the video versions previously released.) I can recommend this with great enthusiasm!"
5,Splendid production of an operatic masterpiece,"I found this DVD production of Wagner's epic Ring Cyle to be hugely enjoyable. It's in many ways a splendid production which keeps the viewer riveted to the drama. On the whole, it's exceedingly well directed, too, even though there're a few minor flaws (which is unavoidable for any production on such a scale). The acting deserves special mention because this production boasts some of the best acting that I've ever seen on the operatic stage, whether in the opera house or on video. The singing is generally very good and every one seems to have given his or her all.I have slight reservations on Boulez's conducting, which is comparatively lightweight when compared with performances by other seasoned Wagnerian conductors. Yet, such an interpretation somehow fits in with the production concept, which is finely realised in the Bayreuth Festival Hall. It all makes an unforgettable viewing/listening experience."
3,Comfortable Seat. but vibrates too loud.,"I loved the look and feel of this seat, but after I bought it and placed the batteries in it, I realized how loudly it vibrates. So make sure before you throw away the box, that yours does not vibrate very loud."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"My wife and I registered for this item after carefully searching for the best bouncer on the market today. Our newborn just loved it at first, he sat comfortably and even slept in it occassionally. However, after about 2 months, the vibrator stopped working and the joints broke (where you can change the reclining position). It was very unstable and wobbled a lot. IN addition, my wife washed the cloth seat according to the directions on the tag. The entire backside of the seat shredded and had holes all over it. I can't believe this cost $50. Please don't waste your money! (I only gave it one star because I had too on the website, otherwise, I wouldn't have given this rating any stars at all!)"
2,Broke after 1 month,"I begged my hubby to shell out the $50 this bouncer cost because it looked so comfy. My son who never slept anywhere but in my bed and in my arms actually napped here. I thought it was the best thing ever! Then after 1 month of use (nap tme) it broke. One of the plastic parts of the reclining feature snapped and now we can't use it. You can imagine my dismay as this was his favorite place to nap. I'm currently trying to take the seat apart and repair it but it's not likely to work...boo, don't by this one."
5,Saved me plenty of times!,"I have to say, I loved this bouncer seat for quite a while. My daughter is 8 months old now and she still uses it once in a while. As a newborn she used it constantly. It was the place where she slept the best, you could tell that she was very comfy! I just wish they had this in pink sooner. I would Recommend this to anyone. Actually, I have."
3,toy bar dangerous,Up until now my son has enjoyed this seat very much. The problem is that the toy bar can come off very easily. It popped off while my 3 month old son was in the seat and the plastic end hit him right next to his eye! This could have resulted in a very serious injury! Also the loose pillow isn't a very good idea either.
1,Carter's -- can you help?,"I am glad to see I'm not alone! I also purchased this bouncer for our baby girl. I thought it looked so cozy. Not long after bringing it home (and throwing the box away, as well as the receipt) we found that the vibrate mode doesn't work -- only music.I see that I'm not alone here. Hopefully someone from Carter's will see that there are some defects with this product and will help us out with a replacement or something. Please?"
1,many problems,"I did not like this bouncy seat. My son is 8 weeks old and suffers from reflux. He is not able to sleep flat on his back. I wanted to buy him a bouncy seat that he could sleep in. I was excited about this seat because it has a reclined as well as flat positon. In the reclined position, his body sinks into the softeness of the seat but his head hits a ""harder"" spot. Therefore, his head was pushed forward to where his chin was touching his chest. It looked so uncomfortable. He hated it. So we took it back.Also, the pillow is not ""detachable"". It is a LOOSE pillow! IT does NOT attach to the seat at all. This is not safe for an infant. As well, the toy bar came off too easily (even with the new design).The only nice thing about this seat is the color. I like the green and blue."
3,Nice for newborns,"I have to say that I registered for this bouncer because my mom liked it. I thought it was cute and cozy looking. I received it as a shower gift, and when my munchkin was born I put her in it shortly after. IT was perfect for when she was small, never had any problems with the vibrating or anything. I do feel that it is quite boring, so once she got older and more interested in playing I got the kick n play bouncer. We still use this bouncer when we're eating fruits or veggies, but I will be lending it to my aunt when her baby arrives. I found it perfect when she was small and I needed to take a shower but she would not go to sleep, put her in, turn on the music and the vibrate and it worked like a charm! Not recommended for older kids for play, kind of boring."
2,Beware of Defects,"I registered for this bouncer for my baby shower after seeing it in the store. Since none of the floor models were working, I went by how the seat looked alone. By far it is one of the more attractive bouncers I thought and looked so cozy I'd want one for myself. I was so excited to put it together and have it all ready for when my baby arrived, however, the vibrate did not work at all, only the music. I was soooo disappointed because I really loved the seat itself and the hearbeat/womb sounds. I was forced to take it back since I thought paying $50 was a rip for something that didn't even work right out of the box. I took it back heartbroken and purchased the aquarium bouncer that had the vibrate mode and still looked somewhat entertaining and comfy."
4,Great bed,"I love this bouncer, but it has one drawback, it doesn't rock. The word cradle made me think it would rock, but it just bounces. My newborn ended up using it as a nice travel bed. I can take it all over the house, and it makes a nice little bed. She also had hated her crib when she was first born because it was too big. However, she would sleep in it in the crib because it was more compact.Unfotunately, the sounds are unimpressive, and she hates the vibrations. If I turn on the vibration, she screams.This would be perfect if it rocked like an actual cradle."
3,Nice Seat But Would Not Recommend....,"I chose this seat for my baby for the looks and comfort of it; however, I would not recommend because the buttons on the side do not work well at ALL. It is very hard to go from the reclined to seated position. Very disapointing."
2,Mine broke,"I decided to get this bouncer, because while I was registering I placed my nephew who was about 6 months at the time and a very well built baby on the demo one at the store. He seemed fascinated with everything and fit very well inside. So thinking this would last me a long time and be able to fit my daughter for months to come I registered for it and received one during my baby shower.But when my daughter was only a month old we picked up the bouncer and noticed one of the legs had come off, we tried to snap it back into the base, but couldn't. Since I received this bouncer as a baby shower present I couldn't get a refund or an exchange, because I had no receipt and no box."
5,I love this bouncer!,"I looked at every bouncer in the store and when I was about to give up I decided to let my son lay in each one. I instantly could tell he loved this bouncer best. I actually bought this to use as a bed. My son hated his craddle and his crib because he was uncomfortable sleeping flat on his back. He spits up a lot and it only got worse when he was laying flat. Anyway, I love this bouncer because it is extra soft and plush. It has a headrest and two positions. The variety of sound choices is nice as well as the vibrating feature. We have used this bouncer every night since week 2 and my now 18 week old has always seemed comfortable."
4,love it,"We love this bouncer. After looking at all the other ones, we decided that this one was so much softer and the fact that you could lay it back for a newborn made us really happy. Our son seems to enjoy it, the only time he doesn't is if the vibration is off for a long time. The only thing we had to change about it were the toys on the hang bar. For visual stimulation, they are not the greatest colors for new babies. We ended up putting a sassy rattle and one of those car seat clip on animals that chime and he loves it. He will nap in it for a few hours at a time also."
4,I Love This Seat,"This seat is so wonderful. Our son is 3 mos. old and we have used it since the day he came home. I love that the seat reclines for easy naps, although we did not use this feature much because our son needed to be on an incline due to his acid reflux. I gave it only four stars for a few reasons. The toy bar falls off quite easily and the toys on it are not much to look at for babies who like bright contrasting colors. Also sometimes I have trouble pressing the buttons to recline the seat. For the uses I got this seat for it is wonderful. I even take it along when we go visiting for naps."
4,My Baby Really Enjoys It!,"This bouncy seat is great. It is really plush and my little girl seems to be really comfortable in it. She enjoys the simplicity of the toys, but she is also only one and a half months. We will probably supplement them later with more entertaining ones.My only complaint is that the detachable toy bar clamps were not designed very well. Until we rigged the bar to be a semi-permanant addition, it would spontaneously collapse and fall right onto our little one."
2,Pick something else,"My son is very comfortable in the bouncer. The music is good, it has 2 different choices fast or slow, and some nature sounds.The vibration sucks. I don't think that he can even feel it, I know I hardly can! I have a big boy (9lbs 3 oz 22.5inches at birth!!!) and he was over 3 months old before he could reach the very boring toys!Unlike other bouncers that bounce with babies movement this one is designed more so that you have to bounce it with your foot. It is however very sturdy.It isn't terrable I just would pick one that offers a bit more entertainment. I let him play in my neices ( I don't know the name but I believe that it is by fisher price and has birds as toys and its yellow) he LOVED it!"
4,cozy and room to grow,"I registered for this seat and my 6 month old has loved it from the start. He even slept in it for a couple of weeks when he had pretty bad reflux. There is a nice variety of features-vibration, music, nature sounds, toys. It is nice and large with a very soft suede-like cover and soft rubber feet to protect furniture."
4,"Great place to ""park"" baby!","This is the only bouncy seat we have and we love it! It is light enough to carry from room to room and even upstairs and downstairs easily. The vibrator batteries last a long time and the seat seems very comfy for baby. The toys weren't all that interesting and I have attached larger more entertaining toys for my 4-month old to play with. Toys are easily interchangeable and removing or attaching the toy bar is a snap. My baby has enjoyed this since birth and continues to do so. The seat is easily removed for cleaning. What I like best about the seat is that it isn't an annoyingly ""loud"" baby print fabric that an infant won't see from their vantage point anyway nor does it rely on flashing lights and other gimicks to distract baby."
3,Average bouncer,"It is a cozy seating design and my baby loves to nap in it. It was especially good for her as a newborn. Now when she tries to play with the toys however, the bar that the toys dangle from repeatedly comes unsnapped and falls down on her. It does not seem to matter how securely I seem to snap the bar back into place, it always falls down. I have not had problems with the vibration completely malfunctioning, but the vibration does seem weak. I would have chosen another bounces if I knew then what I know now."
4,Great for newborns,"This was 1 of 3 bouncers I received for my newborn. I kept them all. This one is especially good for newborns. It's so comfy and cozy for them and seems to make them feel like they're still in the womb. But, it's boring for any child over 3 months. It's too small at that point. Or it could just be my butterball who made his intro at 8lbs, 10oz. A keeper for newborns, if you can afford to have more than 1 bouncer...otherwise, pass on this and go for the Fisher Price Kick & Play or the Fisher Price Infant to Toddler Rocker"
4,Great bouncer!,"This is a great bouncy seat! It does not bounce on its own, though.It vibrates (which helps soothe a cranky baby) and it has music and it also has the sound of the womb.The toybar often pops off and the toys are not that colorful but I just switch them with other toys.I was going to get the Baby Papasan but after comparing the seat to this one I knew this was the one to get! The baby papasan's seat felt uncomfortable, as if there was a bar underneath it. This seat is so soft and snuggly."
3,Okay for use in the beginning,"I bought this after returning the Baby Papasan thinking it would be better. It's a good place to put the baby when you need to do things, but it didn't keep his attention for very long because there aren't the so called ""bells and whistles"". The toybar seemed to scare him because when you attach it, it is so close to the baby. I will look for something else now."
3,ok but not great,"I researched every baby item I registered for and spent a great deal of time on this. This bouncer was the only thing I was disappointed in. It was stable but it just doesn't bounce. Now that my son is 5 months and 20 pounds he can get it to bounce but he is almost outgrown it. When I needed the bounce he just didn't have the power to make it go. I would recommended something with a little more spring. I like everything else about it, it is easy to clean and easy to pick up and move."
3,no in between,"This bouncy makes the child's chin touch their chest and they just look uncomfortable in it. Also, you can move it from a level position to an upright position, but there is no in between. The upright postition is too upright, unless you strap them in each time, they could fall out. Sometimes I just wanted an in between position so they wouldn't spit up, but also wouldn't fall out."
2,not so great,"I got this seat for my shower and while it worked okay with a newborn, my two month old has outgrown it. I also had problems with the buttons on the side. I never could get them to push in so I could change the position of the seat. Also when my son would lay in it in the flat position, his head would be lower than the rest of his body. It was almost like it was broken but it wasn't. I don't really recommend this seat."
3,"Cozy seat, but toy bar falls off.","I wish I could rate this product higher because I do like many things about it.On the plus side...-very cozy and soft-great music and sfx-easy to bounce-attractive-can easily change toysNegatives...-toy bar constantly fell off when our son was just old enough to swat or yank on it. We had to constantly snap it back on.-two of the three toys my son had no interest in so we swapped them out with other toysWe do have a friend who has no problem with the toy bar on their Baby Vines Bouncer, and it looks like they changed the design on the pink version, so that the toy bar would not fall off."
4,"My daughter's ""nest""","When my daughter was a newborn, this bouncer was one of the few things she would sleep in. We called it her little ""nest"" because she looked so comfy. When she got a little older, we put it on the next level, so that she could sit up more in it. The toys on the toy bar weren't very interesting and too small for her to reach, so I put some different toys on the toy bar. My daughter is 4 months old now and doesn't like it anymore. She outgrew it somewhere between 3 and 4 months old. Now she likes the Flutterbye Dreams bouncer. It sits up better and has a lot more interesting things to look at and grab.Bottom line... absolutely wonderful for the first 3-4 months!"
4,Good Seat - What I expected for the price,"I liked this seat because of the upright and recline position as well as the softness of the fabric. The toys are a bit boring but there are tons of toys outthere that come with the linking rings that you can attach instead. The vibration does not seem to be too intense but I would not want it too intense as my purpose for the seat is to soothe my baby girl and not for play time. Overall, the seat is what I expected it to be and think it is worth the $'s."
4,Great little baby seat,"This seat is some comfy and cozy for baby! He's five months old and still loves it for short periods of time. It's only downfall is it doesn't sit up enough or have enough entertainment. My little guy gets frustrated because he's sitting too far back and he's starting to get really curious about his surroundings. As a matter of fact, I'm going out tonight to get him an exersaucer due to the fact that he just needs more activity. But for newborns and young infants this seat is wonderful. The fabric is super soft and easy to clean. The batteries are easily accessible and the toy bar stays on no matter how hard baby bats at toys."
2,Boring..,I bought this for my newborn son because it looked so comfortable. I stood in the aisle at the store trying to decide between this one and a bouncer that was very colorful with alot of toys. Well I wish I chose the other one because this bouncer is so boring. My son hates being in it. It's not entertaining at all. The toys are incredibly boring and blah. Im going back to the store today and buying the one I should have bought in the first place. I guess I will give this one to my mother or someone to keep at their house.
2,"Bad Bouncer, Good chair","I read the mixed reviews on this bouncer before I regestered for it. I decided to get it because I liked how soft it was, and also the way it looked. Big mistake!This bouner is so boring, it barley even moves. I had a big baby and I thought that maybe the weight of her body would make the vibration more evident, but i don't think she can even feel it. The whole thing is made really cheap. A friend of mine got this and she said her daughter hated it too so she returned it for the aqua bouncer. I wish I had got that...I did end up getting a the Aqua swing though, and my daughter Loves IT! so check that out"
4,Great for tiny babies--but toys are boring,"We use this bouncer all the time with our son, who is now 6 weeks old. I LOVE the fact that it has a horizontal setting for naps that makes it kind of like a hammock, good for tiny babies who are not yet able to control those big, floppy heads! The vibrate feature is great, too, very quiet, and the seat cushion washes well if you follow the instructions. What I do not like about this bouncer is that the toys on the toy bar (which is detachable) are not stimulating at all. They are pastel in color, which makes them pretty for us to look at, but pretty boring for him. Also, the buttons that you press on either size to adjust the position of the seat are sometimes hard to work, especially with Baby in the seat. Those are small issues, though, and I would definitely buy this bouncy seat again."
2,More bad than good,"We put this on our registry because it seemed so cozy...and our newborn did sleep in it. Nature sounds were also a nice feature. If you're just looking for a place for baby to sleep in another room...this might be it.However, the headrest does NOT keep the baby's head from falling, in fact, it pushes the head down into the chin! It works better if you put the headrest behind the shoulders.Also ,it doesn't bounce with the baby's movement, the vibration is barely noticeable, the swaddler is cumbersome to use, and the toys never interested my baby at all. I had to change them from day one.Our boy is now 3 months, and was in his cousins Fisher Price Flutterbye bouncer and had a BALL! So we are switching."
2,"This IS great for newborns, but that's pretty much it.","I registered for this partly because it received a high rating from other parents and partly because it wasn't so ""circusy"" looking. I liked the colors and it went well with my son's theme for his room.My son actually took many naps in this as a newborn. However after he became a bit more alert, this bored him. AND he is only 3 months old and a bit small (38th percentile for weight and 50th for height) and yet he seems to have outgrown this. He no longer looks comfortable and he does not like being in this bouncer.If you are looking for a bouncer to entertain and stimulate your child, I recommend the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer. My son LOVES the sounds and lights. He watches the fish and squeals with excitment when he see/hears the bubbles."
3,I like it but...,"At 3.5 months, my son is first appreciating the toy bar on the bouncer. As an infant, he wasn't into the whole vibrating thing, so the seat was never a huge favorite but, it served it's purpose as a comfy place for him to be when I took my speed shower. He doesn't care for the harness and, he's a big boy so the fact that it's not very tight around him is disappointing, expecially since he's doing a lot of stretching, bearing weight on his legs (i.e. pelvic thrusts). It's the only bouncer we have, so I can't compare it...it's not bad, but it's not great."
2,"The title should be ""XHTML for highly motivated dummies""","If you're a true dummy (as I am sometimes), this book really is not for you. You would need to be a ""dummy who is highly motivated and has lots of time to learn XHTML."" You would want to be a ""dummy who already has some familiarity with HTML but wants to get to the next level"" or a ""dummy with an extraordinarily high IQ but low self-esteem or garbled speech or dilated pupils, hence the (misplaced) dummy label."" If however, you have the intelligence, the patience, the time, energy, motivation and personal ambition to wade through this long and highly technical (but written in plain language) book, you could conceivably learn XHTML, make lots of money as an XHTML programmer, and nobody, I mean NOBODY, would call you a ""dummy"" again."
3,good referance material,"After purchasing another Xhtml tutorial (Beginning Xhtml by Frank Boumphrey ) I decided to purchase the XHTML for Dummys hopeing it would not get to advanced so soon in the text. well the dummys book does explain every concept in detail, but I found it did not have enough hands on examples to develop my coding skill. if you are a complete beguiner like me look for a diffrent book. if you now know html and need to upgrade to XHTML this is the book for you."
3,Good intro to XHTML,"Don't even bother learning HTML 4 - XHTML will replace it eventually so you might as well go with the wave of the future.XHTML for Dummies is a solid INTRODUCTION to XHTML. If you have already reached the intermediate level, then this book is for you. However, if you want to design websites and don't know where to start, then give this book a shot."
4,Fun,"I use this with my Kindergarten group. We play different games.Not only good for phonics work, but cut and glue practice."
1,AMISH COOKING COOKBOOK,"TOO DIRTY!! I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED BRAND NEW INSTEAD, ESPECIALLY THE COST WITH POSTAGE!! OUTSIDE COVER VERY DIRTY! PAGES VERY DIRTY!!"
4,I love my Amana,Great refrigerator with all kinds of little niches for all your different types of foods and liquids. The ice dispenser is a little rough at times and breaks the ice cubes even in the cube position but it's a frig purchased for a man...I love it.Update: A couple months later and I still love it. The ice dispenser jams from time to time and I have to shut off the automatic ice making function to let the amount of ice thin out to get at the jam. Also the door handle to the refrigerator came to me loosely fixed to the door and I forgot to mention that earlier. Minor issue for how great it's been.
3,Amana Fridge,"The refridgerator is fine. The space inside is great but the ice dispenser drives me crackers!!! And that's the main reason I bought it. I was so excited about getting a water and ice dispenser. I love that it has a light on it that tells you when you need to change the water filter but ice goes flying everywhere whenever I use it-cubed or crushed. When the repairman came out he said ""You need to hold your glass up closer"". That's not right. I've noticed other peoples' ice dispensers and they don't do this. Even when it's on 'cubed' some of the ice gets crushed and goes flying. Very annoying and should happen for the amount of money we paid."
3,More of a gentle storm,"I have two others of Dan Gibson's Thunderstorm CD's, Thunderstorm in Surround Sound, and Thunderstorm in the Wilderness. I like these two better than Rolling Thunder, because in Rolling Thunder it's more like gentle rain storm, with very little Thunder. It's a very good CD, but I think that it should of been called Gentle Storm. If your looking for stormier weather get the two others I've wrote about.I have over 40 of Dan Gibson's Solitudes CD, so you could say I'm a big fan. Thank You Christina"
5,Enchanting Story,"I have read hundreds of romance novels since the age 11, and I can honestly say that this is my best romance ever. I read it about five years ago. This a beautiful story about a lady Ghislaine who sets out to revenge a really BAD man Nicholas, who she holds responsible for the loss of everything she holds dear. When I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING a lady could possibly lose. However, her revenge plot backfires, and she is at the mercy of this blackguard who is actually the hero of the story.What I liked most about A Rose at Midnight is the hero. He was just so incredibly bad, (and good-looking)that he was wonderful. There is nothing like a romance novel with a wicked hero, who gets reformed by the heroine. I love Anne Stuart's books because she really knows how to create a devilish hero with the face of an angel. But this one is just her best."
5,very good,I just loved Ghislaine and how the author was not afraid to have her character do watever she had to do back then in order to survive.
2,Not as good as I was expecting.,"This book came to me very highly reviewed, which might have been part of the reason I was so disappointed. The book started quite interstingly, with Ghislaine plotting to kill Nicholas, but after the first few chapters, everything went downhill. I didn't feel for any of the characters; their stories just didn't move me. I didn't think Nicholas had a good enough reason to be a ""wasted life"" and although Ghislaine's prostitution should have been heartbreaking, I just didn't care.Tony and Ellen's story felt contrived just to add enough pages to the novel to suplement Nicholas and Ghislaine's weak story. The story dragged with no forward action in the relationship for hundreds of pages. Even the end didn't feel quite right, lacking a great sense of completion. It did not make me feel like everything was going to work out between them and everyone was going to live happily ever after.I'm just annoyed that I bought this one."
2,Dexter is not playing very well,"There are alot of marvelous musicians on this record. Herbie Hancock does a wonderful job as music director. It is a real treat to hear John McGloughlin play standard, traditional jazz guitar. No one can doubt his chops, but some if his playing on his Mahavishnu Orchestra is just noise to me.The movie that serves as the inspiration of this record is good to see and interesting for the story. Dexter's playing is some of his worst. I do not know if the point of the story is to tell the last years of a broken down jazz musician or if not, but that is how he sounds for much of this soundtrack.If you want this record as souvenir of the movie, so be it. If you want this record to be an example of Dexter Gordon's playing, forget it. I probably have most if not all of the compact discs commercially available of Dexter Gordon's music--both live dates and studio recordings. This is not one of his best performance."
5,Very real looking,"These have wonderful color! My 12 year old daughter saw them and instantly wanted a pair. My coworkers thought they were real. I have purchased other ""gemstones"" because I liked these so much."
2,Loved them and lost them.,"Beautiful as advertised, loved the color and cut. One flaw however, post is way too short. Lost one of them the first time I wore them. It was a love hate thing."
3,quality for money,"I purchased these ear rings from amazon. The quality is good . I gave them to my daughter,she loves them, they are not too small or large, just right for dress up and the casual look."
1,Buyer Beware,"These earrings are supposed to have one carat stones. In reality, the stones are about 1/2 carat each...much smaller than advertised."
2,"ditto, plus WAY too many errors",My students have also asked me to change books. It does contain some good information if you can wade through the mistakes to find it.
3,Book review,"Received the book in a fare condition, but 6 pages of bulding plan that was attached at the end of the book was missing."
3,commercial wiring text book,"This book is based around a set of blueprints for a small commercial building. The prints provided are somewhat abbreviated. I suppose it was for space and to force students to look in the textbook for answers, but a real set of prints doesn't come with a textbook. The text uses all the new 2011 NEC codes for commercial wiring, it covers how to read prints, spec books, calculations, conduit fill, codes, and more. It is a good book for new students and could provide a review for the more seasoned electrician. I would like to see this and the NEC provided in an electronic format that could be used on the go, such Ebooks, Kindles, Smartphones, ect."
3,Commercial Wiring,"It is a very good book for electricians. This book is the textbook for a trades school. The NEC, National Electrical Code is one of the principal subjects in the book."
5,TOO TIGHT FOR WORDS,"I carefully select the albums that I review because I am pretty picky when it comes to music. I have this CD for a few months, when it first came out I didn't know anyone who had ever heard of Lisa. But that didn't last long. This album is spreading like WILDFIRE! I espcially love this album because she classically mixes the songs that you can jam to and the others that you just want to turn up and listen to while you read, type, or just to get you in the right mindset for worship. Not only does she have a beautiful voice, but the beats are all great on this album. If you are looking to get switch from secular artists like Lauryn Hill, Jill Scott, and so many other Neo soul...THIS ALBUM IS A MUST!!!! You won't regret it. BIG UPS LISA!!!!! Praise God for you."
5,My Diary Your Life,"This cd is worth $20.00 easily. The production, the message [which isn't compromised] and the hip style are to be commended. Can't wait for ""Soul Music."" Peace, Brian"
3,Dialectical Behavior Therapy in Private Practice,"As long as the reader recognizes that Marra is not writing a book about protocol DBT, his ideas are a just fine adjunct to the library. The clinician needs to be ready to recognize the differences and make informed choices."
5,Capone's Cornfields,A fascinating and funny book about mob connections in a section of Downstate Illinois. The author made good use of irony and dry humor. An enjoyable read.
5,book review,I really enjoyed this book. It is local history mixed with people everyone would recognize.
4,Works great,I have this fan for 5 years now and still works fine so is my xbox 360. The only downside is its a little too loud. This fan does not work with all xboxes though.
1,Poor service,I ordered this item in January. I have made multiple attempts to contact this seller to no avail. I still have not received this item or an email letting me know what the problem is. I would NOT recommend this seller to anyone for any reason. If I could give less than one star I definitely would.
2,Nothing can hide from time,"Bought the Nyko Intercooler a few days after buying the 360 in October of 06, hoping to satisfy the fear of the red circle. Everything looked to be working. The fans rotated and my system wasn't dying. Although you can't really tell if the fans are working or not to cool th system down. And the power cord wasn't fully connected -even though it did ""click"" to represent that the cord went in as far as it could go- which required that I couldn't move my system while it was on or the 360 would shut off.By the time May came around, my cooler shut off; it wouldn't work. I tried everything possible to revive the product, but nothing worked. And I wouldn't have minded this problem so much if it wasn't for the fact that the day prior to it stopping it was working excellent. It didn't even sound like it was dying.Based on reviews of other irate buyers, this product has no consistency. It can die anytime from 1 month to a year from buying the cooler."
4,Nice garage/disco/house compilation,"This is a fun compilation in the Disco Kandi series. The songs are the perfect soundtrack for a Saturday night, or any party. Keep you moving, the songs will stay in your head. Disc one kicks off with the funky Love Theme (Party) by (Love) Tattoo. Deepstar's ""Sugar"" is a highlight as is ""That's How Good Your Love Is"" by Il Padrions feat Jocelyn Brown, ""Do 4 Love"" by Fuel, Fac 15 feat Cathi Ogden on ""Haven't You Heard"". Disc one is closed out with the excellent ""Dove (I'll Be Loving You)"" by Moony, which is a highlight. Some highlights on disc two include ""Because"" by HiFi Serious, ""Galaxy 2000"" by War, a great cover of Prince's ""I Would Die 4 U"" done by The Space Cowboy, ""Fire"" by Mousse T feat Emma Lanford and many others."
5,"Sexy, Dangerous, Romantic - All of Gayle Wilson's Touches!","This book was wonderful! Sexy and Dangerous, Romance with adrenaline! Gayle Wilson never fails to entertain me with her prose! Recommend this book to anyone who loves fast paced, danger packed romances! The characters are as strong and as real as the danger they are in! Buy it today and you'll not be disappointed!"
3,"Reads Quickly, but Doesn't Really Work on Any Level","Ummmmm...what was this book supposed to be again? As a mystery tale, it falls flat since there's really only one person who it could be and...surprise! That person did it. As a love story, it doesn't really work, since the protagonists only have a couple of encounters. Thorne is unable to leave his house and Kate is running all over the country. There really isn't enough interaction to see them falling in love, yet there they are in the end, apparently set to live happily ever after. Five run-ins and sex do not a happy ending make. And as a suspense novel, it doesn't really work, since there's not that much tension to push things along. Wilson's usual writing flair is present, giving the proceedings a slight boost. Too bad she didn't come up with a story worth bothering with."
3,Couldda been a contender....,"There are some great ideas and insights on this DVD, some real meat, but the instruction is lacking, the production quality very poor, and I don't think the ideas come across clearly. The examples are gone in a flash, never really fleshed out. Never any tablature on the screen. The booklet contains many mistakes. Pete's mic often cuts in and out as he turns to the drum set, very annoying. No real opportunities to ""play along"". For example, Pete mentions the Elvin Jones style and plays about 15 seconds worth...it would be better to lay out four part tab and provide a minute or two of musical example.My guess is they rushed this in one take. Too bad, because there are no great jazz instruction DVD's out there. Maybe Tommy Igoe or Steve Smith (and Hudson Music) will make one. I can't believe Hal Leonard let this out the door."
3,CD case was broken,"Unfortunately the CD case was pretty banged up by the time I received this item, and I had purchased it as a Christmas gift for someone. I don't know if that was due to it getting crushed in transit or if it was insufficiently packaged in the first place."
1,Wasted money!!,"I ended up returning this item, as the music in not worth the vinyl it is printed on! Amazon should not even carry this item!! This is not music but music related racism!!! Pure Garabge!!"
3,For High School Teachers,"The premise behind this book is great. I was hoping to have some instant lessons to use with my fourth grade students. While some of the lessons are adaptable to that age, the activities are really designed for high school classes."
5,Very comprehensive and practical,"A very comprehensive book for those who are interested in using literature circles to boost their students' interest in reading and speaking skills. It can surely help you to gain a very good understanding of what literature circles are and the ""tips"" provided after the description of every lesson are quite helpful. However, the lessons described in the book are for first language learners and you will need make adaptations if you want to use the ideas with your EFL students."
4,excellent resource,I was looking for a fun way to do some interventions in the classroom and found this book very useful and an excellent resource. Why invent the wheel when someone already did a good job. I would reccomend this book for beginners. Worth the money
3,"Not a review, just an opinion","As an individual that currently works in athletics I would like to expand the discussion to include a much older paradigm than modern college athletics. I do see student athletes as employees but not in the sense being reported here, I would have to say it is much more medieval in it's purest form and refer to it as indentured servitude.Do not fool yourself into believing that this servitude is solely for those on scholarship because as a past DIII student athlete I can tell you that I was told more than once that I better do what I was told or I would not be on the team.The only reason I rated the book is so I might be able to post my thoughts. I will be ordering this book to better educate myself and then I can leave a real review but after reading the post I felt compelled to add my input."
3,"Pretty good, but basic and bland","Covers all aspects of academic publishing thoroughly. Provides extensive documentation from other sources. Not particularly inspiring, but good if you don't know the basics."
1,doesn't come with a back strap like picture shows,sent this shoe back because it had no heel strap like it shows on the picture.
2,a general essay,"Perhaps this book is of interest to historians, but in general is a very dry technical essay. Illustrations are black and white and of extremely poor quality. I was very disappointed and but for the fact the invoice and packaging for it and 3 other books purchased at the same time disappeared, I would have returned all 4."
2,"Has its merits, but doesn't explain enough","I had to use this book for French 101 in college. I don't recommend it, if you're not being forced to purchase it. The culture sections do contain a lot of helpful and interesting information about France and the other French-speaking countries, but the book has a nasty habit of not explicitly defining the vocab words it introduces. Many of the nouns come in the form of little drawings, with the French underneath. If the picture is unclear (which they tend to be), you'll have to check the French-English dictionary in the back. Most of the words they use are there, but not all of them. In those cases, grab a bigger dictionary or Google Translate. I got my book used, and the person who I bought it from wrote many of the translations next to the words, which helped me out a lot.I understand that a foreign language textbook can use words that it doesn't explicitly define, but it shouldn't be doing it when introducing the basic chapter vocab words."
3,Good book,"Good book, in good condition. A little overpriced because i expected the workbook to be included but oh well!"
2,not a book for French beginners,"I don't like this book, actually i am taking French in college now, this is the textbook for my elementary course. but i don't think it is a book for beginners, there are too much infor in one chapter. and it never makes it clear the grammar points/pronunciation, the CDs read very fast to catch up with."
3,O.K. skull cap,This skull cap is O.K. for the price. It's made a little small. I use it for under a motorcycle helmet and for mountain biking. I have a under armor cap too that is made a little better (better/wider elastic band) - but for 5 bucks more.
2,pump filter,Disappointed with this. This is really only good for SMALL INDOOR pumps. Won't fit over most of the pumps. Doesn't work well in dirty water.
2,Weird,"Even though it's supposed to be a Western, I would rather categorize it as a Cartoon.Only in Cartoon's people are able to endure soooo much without expressing pain.The basic story is good, but how the movie was made is just to weird.Wil"
2,One Cent,"I bought this used on Amazon.com for one cent...a penny. I must admit, it is worth much more and even though it is choppy and dissected from start to finish, it has its moments. The acting is extremely good...I believe the script and editing were fine, too...but there's something about this film that didn't hit the target. Maybe you'll like it more than I did. Give it a try."
4,Awsome movie!,"This is an awsome Western thriller that kept me excited with suspense and terror way up untill the shocking climax and stunning conclusion.I don't usually like westerns, but I love Dances with Wolves and especially this movie! The ghost crusader guy was creepy and menacing!"
3,I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This,I choose this book because I have enjoyed Bob over the years..II was good to learn more about his personal life. A good man.Title: I Shouldn't Be Doing This! And Other Things That Strike Me
5,Great Bio of Bob Newhart,Easy and fun reading. Loved the old routines of a great comedian. He is truly a gifted and unique writer with such a dry wit.
3,Relaxing fun!,I found this book to be organically funny. Some quips made me laugh out loud! It was refreshing to learn about how he worked hard to get where he is with an extreme amount of integrity and amusement.
4,I shouldn't Even be Doing This,"Not a rib splitter. But a good, relaxing read. Lots of fun stories about Newhart and his celebrety friends. If you like Newhart's sense of humor, you will like this book."
3,Not my kind of book,"This isn't the type of book I usually read, so it seemed slow in comparison, but I read the whole thing. I enjoyed it overall. If you are familiar with Newhart's humor, you already know he's very low key, and the book is similar. But the stories are interesting and the Newhart humor comes through at times."
2,Disappointed,More like a rehash of old comedy skits than any insight into the life of the writer. Would not recommend to anyone.
2,I thought the book was boring and did not read the last quarter of the book which is very unusal for me as I enjoy reading very,"I thought it was a very boring book, slow and dreary, felt like it was a drag every time I picked it up and did not even read the last quarter of the book which is not like me because I love to read. I can't even imagine who would enjoy this book but everyone has different tastes."
3,"Decent , if only for the humor",Standard bio stuff. If you are familiar with Newhart's delivery you can almost hear him deliver the comedy material he includes. That makes this an enjoyable read.
2,A dissapointment,This book was basically boring and not worth the time it took to read it. I was expecting it to by really funny but I can only say that I laughed reading one paragraph in the whole book.
3,Newhart Bio,"This is a nice autobiography, but Bob's humor is not as funny in print as it is from Bob live."
4,Newhart Review,"I have been a fan of Newhart since ""The Button Down Mind"" days. Book just about covers the history of Newhart."
3,Disappointing,"Newhart's life story is not that interesting. The book rambles and is only sometimes funny. If you've already heard his phone routines, there's nothing new in here."
4,Quintessential Bob,"This autobiography of Bob Newhart seemed to capture the quintessential Bob Newhart... down to earth, dry humor. His comedy routunes don't translate all that well to the printed word, since his delivery has a lot to do with the humor. However, it was an interesting biography and I enjoyed reading it."
2,Disappointed,"I like Bob Newhart, but this book was not as good as I was hoping for. It was not a quick read."
5,Bob Newhart,I grew up watching Bob Newhart on TV. I remember watching him on the Tonight Show and on His own sitcoms. He tells how he got started and background information. I always liked Bob Newhart and I liked this book.
5,Newhart Fans Need to Read This,"I listed to ""The Button Down Mind"" when I was a kid and my parents had the album. I've been a Bob Newhart fan ever since. This was a great book that led me down memory lane."
2,Maybe I expected too much....,"I love Bob Newhart ... so when this book was offered for $2.99 I grabbed it. The first 10 pages were really funny but the remaining was a lot of ""fill in"" with old routines and conversations that just didn't come across very funny in print.I was really disappointed. When I first saw the title I laughed...... AFTER I read the book, I thought ""how appropriate"""
5,I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This,"Being a long-time Bob Newhart fan I could hardly wait to buy this book. As would be expected, Bob tosses out his genteel type of humor in his telling. It's hard to put down."
5,This is a very funny book,Bob Newhart is one of the funniest people alive. We have been laughing at his droll humor and perfect timing for forty years. His hilarious sketches are delivered with a superb talent and an almost inexplicable gift. His humor is honest and is not delivered at the expense of anyone. This book conveys a real sense of the stage performance that we all love.This is a very funny book.
5,Very funny!,It was interesting. I enjoyed reading about different events in his life. He has a unique since of humor. I would recommend the book especially for fans of Bob Newhart.
4,Who is Bob Newhart!!,What a good book. Have enjoyed the experience of learning about Bob. So glad this book was offered. So hard not to laugh as going thru his acts. Puts a smile on my face at each page.....
1,Hurried through it.,He's much better to watch and listen to. The printed page does not communicate his humor. It desperately needs his physical presence.
3,newhart is easy to read,can be read in between other books.cute at times;very funny at timesinteresting to read of his childhood experiences
3,Okie Dokie,"It would be much better if it was read by him at his rate of speech and with his pauses. I tried to picture him delivering the stories, but it was difficult to do. The book was flat without him delivering it."
2,"Interesting, mostly if you're curious about Bob Newhart","I'm not as negative as some other reviewers, and this is light reading you can pick up when you have free time and nothing else Kindle-ish to read. I'll probably finish it, but it's not interesting enough to keep me bound to the pages. It has some insights into Newhart's life -- some of them not very complimentary although he seems to think providing phoney government travel vouchers for auditor work is amusing rather than shameful.The book doesn't do much to enhance his reputation and lessens his image as thoughtful humorist observer."
4,Great read,"Very funny, made me laugh out loud. Talks,about a lot of famous people but never trashes anyone. A very. Classy guy"
1,Boring.,I'm sorry I wasted my money on such a boring book. I got it for my husband & he thought it was boring.
2,Droll,Droll from beginning to end. Did not bother reading the last four chapters as could not help but to become very bored by it all.
2,ZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,mildly to hardly interesting biography that name-drops and re-hashes the routines that those of us who would buy the book already know. you'd be better off buying the CD's of his from the 60's.
5,"Smart, Funny and a pleasure to read!","Bob Newhart's I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This!:And Other Things That Strike Me as Funny, is a delightful book.In it Bob tells his story, including his youth, early careers, entry to professional comedy, and his life after becoming a household name.The book is not cronically arrainged, as a formal biography might be, but arrainged by topic-- like conversation over a cold beer, or warm cup of coffee.This book brings Bob Newhart over for a chat, and gives you a real feel for who he is.This book is a great read for any Newhart fan, or anyone who appreciates a good (and funny) story!"
4,Newhart is funny,"This is not a true bio. It is about Newhart, but, different parts of his career. The early part of his career is interesting. Lot of little tidbits about his various TV programs. Some things were very funny in the telling. I found out things I did not know about him personally. I was a fan of his first two TV series, but not the others."
3,I Shouldn't Even Be Writing This...,"Bob Newhart is a funny, funny comedian and actor. No question. But as a writer of books...not so much.I could listen to/watch Newhart routines all day long. However, his humor doesn't appear to translate well to the page - could be his writing?If you're a Newhart fan you'll find some laughter in some of the gems in this book and you'll be one step closer to knowing Newhart the man. If, on the other hand, you're not familiar with Newhart and his deadpan delivery I'm afraid you'll find this book dull and only moderately funny.If you're exploring Newhart, start with his recordings and/or his TV shows. Only once you get a feel for his timing, facial expressions and intonations will you begin to appreciate what's in this book."
5,Great book!!!,I don't read a lot of autobiographies but saw this and couldn't resist getting it. I'm glad I did! This is Bob Newhart at his best! With bits of his comic routines woven into the stories of his life this book is highly entertaining. Read it! You won't be disappointed!
4,A little scattered but a good read,"This is classic Bob Newhart. He lost me a few places because he seemed a little scattered, but you can just hear his voice while reading it. There were many things I just didn't even realize about him and it was fascinating."
2,"Umm...Hello, better said than read!","Listening to Bob Newhart is much better than reading him. I tried imagining him doing the routines, but it just didn't work for me!"
4,I like Bob.,Bob Newhart is one of my favorite comedians. I have watched all his TV shows and really enjoyed them He has done a good job of explaining his career.
4,Funny,Nice insight into a life of some one I have enjoyed thru the years. I never thought he intended to be a comic.
3,"Uh, uh, well....","Always loved Bob Newhart's low-key comedy. Some funny stories in this book, but maybe Bob needs to vacation wayout in the country, perhaps at an old inn, to work on his next book; maybe after consulting with a psychologist.."
2,Should Have Been Better,"This book could and should have been a lot better. It's very small and an easy read. Bob jumps all over the place in it and there is no structure to the chapters. It is at it's best when he talks about how his career began, what he did before entertainment, how he met his wife and the other celebrities that he knows (like Don Rickles). Too much text is devoted to jokes that don't work as well in print as they do when you get to hear his voice and his way of telling a story. I really like Bob, but this book seems like it was quickly put together and I wish that I would have waited for it to come out in paperback because there's not enough in it to warrant the $23.95 cover price. I hope that Bob writes a longer and better book. I'm looking forward to buying the 5th season of The Bob Newhart Show on DVD!"
3,I needed more stories about his TV days!,"This was an entertaining book, but there was too much about his early show-biz days, and not much at all about his career in television. This was a disappointment, because I am primarily of fan of Bob's through TV. He even seemed somewhat disconnected, or disinterested, when he did finally mention his series work. For instance, talking about George & Leo, he mentioned that he had a daughter, whereas he actually had a son, in that show. Still, Bob's fans will probably enjoy the book."
2,Left Me wanting more.,"Didn't care for it. Not enough personal details. Nothing about life in the fast, hollywood, lane. Left me wanting more. Always liked Bob Newhart shows."
3,Bob Newhart,"I enjoyed his comedy routines, T.V. series and movies. The book has no shocking revelations, hes just a nice guy remembering success"
4,A Funny Read,"If you like Bob Newhart, then you'll enjoy reading this book. A lot of funny stories. A little insight into his personal side."
4,Bob Newhart; the guy that has given button-hole genre a new twish,"Love it; love him. He is very funny. Not sure why I would have to have so many words here. Just wanted to say ""love it; love him."
2,Stick to the verbal Newhart - it is much better than the written!!!,"Back in ""the day"" I enjoyed Bob Newhart and even own several of his recordings. His delivery was wonderful and produced laughter among many of us. It is not very funny without his delivery. I have not finished the book, but it has so far, left me wanting to hear Bob deliver the lines."
4,I'm a fan!,"I have long admired Bob's humor--never any blood and lots of fun. I liked also, getting to know him as a real person. Thanks Bob Newhart!"
1,destroyed my lawn,"i've used this every year in the past, so used it again this year without fear...what a mistake. my formerly dark, emerald green, lush St. Augustine lawn now looks like brown swirls. You can actually tell where the fertilizer was spread by the circular shapes. My neighbors have all asked ,""What happened?"". I wrote to the company , which sent me a five paragraph canned response, the end of which (after they got past proselytizing about phosphorus) said water my lawn a half an inch every three days and at the end of a full month send them pictures and a proof of purchase from the bag (discarded three weeks ago) or an itemized receipt (ditto..why would I hang onto that?)I won't be using their products again. I've used the same spreader and the same product successfully in the past, so the only thing that could have changed is their product."
3,A Bit Disappointed ...,"Maybe its because I plan events or not, but I felt like this book was limited. For the price, I expected to receive more helpful tips and tools of trade. I don't have any other books to reccomend, but I don't know that this one is that helpful to the masses. I suppose if you truly know nothing about planning events it might be helpful."
4,well...It's original,"I played this game when I was about 10 years old, it's like an RPG for the kids. it's good fir kids, I dont remember enough of it to really tell much about it, you can find it on many rom sites"
5,Love This Movie,This is a great movie. I was hoping there was a DVD. I try to watch it every Christmas. Love the actors and the story. Good movie for all ages.
4,behind the bedroom wall,I like this book. In the beginning young Korina was a Nazi and she hated Jews. Then Korina finds out that there are Jews in her house and if you hide Jews you die. I recommend this book because there's a lot of action throughout the book. I also recommend this book because at the end the Nazi's almost find that they were hiding Jews but Korina saves them. If you like action you would like this book.
4,Hiding the Jews,"This book gives you a whole new perspective on the holocaust. There's a family secretly hiding Jews behind their bedroom wall, the thing is Korrina, the active Nazi of the family does not know about it. When she finds out she is furious with her parents and thinks of them as traders, but as she gets to know the Jews, her whole perspective changes. Find out what happens to the Jews and see what Korrina does to help! ""...if you're not free to love whom you wish, what good is love...""Author Laura Williams uses many inspirational quotes and messages in her book that can relate to your everyday life, such as this one here. I really recommend reading this book. It teaches you a lot about history, it is fun and exciting to read, and it teaches you good life lessons. What more could you ask for all in one book?"
2,My opinion,"Everyone has a different opinion about this book. Some people think this book is good, some think it's But to me I think this book is definitly interesting based on the characters' opinions. For example, when the main character says to her mother "" Isn't He (Hitler) great? I mean look at all the things he has done for Germany. When he is finshed this country will be just like it used to be!"" Then the mother replied "" Yes, he is a wonderful man"". And in most of Americas' minds he is a terrible man. We look at all the innocent people he killed or hurt. To me, this is a book for people who are interested in history."
2,Voice is strong Material is Boring,Kelly Price can Sing but most of this material doesn't do anything for Her range.pretty much just there&if it weren't for Her voice I'd stopped half-way into the music.I dig Her other stuff better.
5,"Great Vocals, Deep Lyrics!","Kelly never dissapoints me! She came through with yet another exceptional album. I can listen to this album from beginning to end and love it all! Even her Introlude is good. My favorite tracks are 1) ""How does it feel(Married Your Girl)"" - I dedicate that song to my ex, I have to stand up & sing along everytime i hear it! 2) ""He Proposed"" -That is a beautiful song & will always be a favorite of mine 3)""I live here now"" - Powerful! Those 3 songs standout, but the entire cd is wonderful! ""Priceless"" is exactly that."
3,"Not ""Priceless""","I must say that this CD is OK. It is not Kelly's best and after waiting sooo long for this CD to be released, I am a little disappointed. It's not as strong as I thought it would be, but I have to give it to Kelly. She has one of the best and strongest voices out there today."
3,"Solid, but not her best","Compared to most other R&B efforts, Priceless shines. Price masterfully blends old school beat with modern styles to fashion a nice album. Three songs that stand out are ""Sister"" with Faith Evans, ""Again"", and ""Back in the Day""But compare to her last two albums, this effort seems sub-par. Kelly seems to scream more than sing, and none of the song are as excetional as her previous efforts.R&B fans will love it. Kelly Price fans will feel unfulfilled."
1,Another Sad Display of a wasted voice.,"Kelly Prices latest effort is a prime display of a Superior voice with inferior material. First of all Kelly Price should not be singing pop songs or anything close. She is one of the very few singers around today that has enormous talent however that talent barely presented itself in a long album of ""quiet"" singing and annoying pop tunes. This is a singer with the capability (as weve seen in the past) to tear the house down and take it to church with her powerful, unfaltering vocals. However she does that on only one, yes one, of the song son this album and that song is ""He Proposed"" which in my opinion is the only song on the album worth listening to. Im sorry Kelly I wish i could have revied this better but please stick to relying on ur vocal ability and not catchy tunes to sell ur albums. From a truly dissapointed fan."
5,Kelly is back and damn am I glad!!,"This is the best Kelly Price album ever. This cd was well worth the almost year wait. I am so happy that Kelly is back, and her songs on this cd are just way too good. My favorite track on this cd is Sister with RnB Queen Faith Evans. So everyone go and buy this album and see how hot and ""priceless"" this RnB Diva's album is."
2,Good characters; not much of a story.,"This is a very intriguing look into the lives of Southerners at the beginning of the 20th century. The characters are authentically human, and the reader will connect with them easily. That's why it's such a shame the author had to waste this carefully constructed setting on a story with virtually no plot whatsoever. The story toys with several relational conflicts as it plods along, but there is never any gripping suspense, and I didn't pick up an overarching theme to tie the story together. The novel as a whole often seems fragmented, jumping from one group of characters to the next, especially toward the end. I read all the way through the book because I became attatched to the characters, but the end of the story left me with an incomplete feeling, as there is never any satisfying resolution. I would only recommend this book if you are studying what it was like to live in the South a century ago, or if you're into tragic soap operas."
3,big buildup--disappointing ending,"The description on the cover of Sunday Clothes intrigued me since I am a Methodist and was very curious about the plot of this book. As I read Addie and Zeb's story, I found myself anxious to get to the end to see how and if everything worked out. As an avid reader of Christian fiction, I am always wondering how the characters work out their spiritual problems. The title of the book also interested me, but even that part of the book did not pan out in the end. The characters do attend church every Sunday, but, other than that, I saw no meaning behind the title. Although Sunday Clothes had some interesting plot twists and sub-plots, I was extremely disappointed that the spiritual conditions of the characters are never referred to. In addition, the ending was a huge disappointment in that several of the plot lines were never tied up. This could have been a great book with a little more work on the ending and on the ""Christian"" part of Christian fiction."
2,future home builder,"This book is too basic with not enough real substance. There are certainly valuable points, insights, and recommendations, however there isn't enough ""meat"" in the book compared to other books on the market. I would not recommend this book unless it were only going to be used to add to an already well-read library on the topic. If you're looking for ""the"" book on building/designing your own custom home, look elsewhere."
2,Not recommended on a regular Kindle!,"I think this is a pretty good book, and I would recommend the print version. It sounds like the Kindle DX version may also be good.However, the whole point of the book is the worksheets. I suspect you'll want to photocopy these and play with different options as you figure out how to build your house.The worksheets are pretty much illegible on the original Kindle (1.0 or 2.0), and even on the DX, I think they would be awkward to photocopy.Other than that, this is a reasonably useful book, content-wise. I also recommend Building Your Own Home for Dummies (Brewster) and Designing Your Own House (Hirsch). Both of those titles are fine on the Kindle (no worksheets)."
2,Not that great,"This is actually a pretty dull version of the game. I think there's a 64 version too, pick that up instead"
3,The cards are not beautiful at all.,"The book might be okay, but I really don't like the cards. I don't like the way they're colored. They look quite rough. Perhaps the colors and simplicity in the clean-cut ""Tarot of Marseilles"" is better."
4,A Funny Tale of Friendship,"3-8 yrs. Children will enjoy this story of Tom and Dom, two Iguana brothers who contemplate such issues as whether or not to eat bugs, their realization that they are dinosaurs, and having friends. They speak english with occasional spanish words reflecting their locale & habitat. A funny story."
5,This is off the chains!!!! Quiks first instrumental ever!!,You get to really hear how hot the beats are and mix the hell out of it too....this is a must for any dj worth his saltHes way ahead of most cats in the game....right up there at the top
5,Our All-Time Favorite,"This is now our all-time favorite children's book. My three-year-old son loves this book. He laughs so hard he runs out of breath, and when Sid's dad begins to fly at the end of the book, he is so relieved and absolutely elated. Not only is this an excellent book, but the looks on my son's face are absolutely priceless and one of my happiest memories."
4,Dreams and Miracles,"With a simple story this book gives a poigent lesson on miracles, hopes and dreams. An uplifting tale about a young dog who comes to realize that miracles do happen and not to let other people (in this case dogs) drag you down with their own disbelief. A book that rhymes with large colourful illustrations will interest even toddlers."
5,Sweet and meaningful,"This is a great story about believing in yourself that manages to get the message across without lecturing. The rhymes are outstanding and the illustration are beautiful with lots of detail to discover. Both our [...] love the book. The language is simple enough for a first grade reading level, by the way. Jez Alborough hardly ever misses, and this book is definitely a score."
5,Great Story and Illustrations,"My 16 month old LOVES this book and I don't mind a bit reading it several times per day. The text is simple and originally rhyming, the illustrations are very cute. Sid is the star of this heartwarming tale that fills the imagination of both adult and child. I look hard for children's books that I enjoy reading and my son enjoys hearing and looking at the illustrations and this one fit's the bill perfectly."
5,A Big Hit with Twin Toddlers!,"We found this book at the library, and were taking it out so often we ended up buy it ourselves (which we NEVER do). Our twins fell in love with Sid when they were about 18 months old. The illustrations are wonderful, the rhyming is adorable, and the story is so positive. We've talked about emotions, friends, family, and a bunch of other topics based on the reading. A GREAT read aloud for little ones, and a good early reader for older kids."
3,"Nice movie, but completely not believable","A hooker with the heart of gold, but that's a complete cliche and the movie just doesn't feel like it's grounded in reality. Nice escape, though."
2,Milk Money Movie,"I purchased the movie ""Milk Money"" because I learned that it was filmed in my hometown. I am disappointed in those in authority to allow such a movie to be filmed in such a wonderful community. The theme of the movie does not fit with the moral standards of the location the producers chose."
5,Excellent Movie,One of her best - everyone should see it. Great price. C'mon guys I don't understand the word limit - as long as I tell what I think of the product I think that should be sufficient.
5,dealing with seedier side of life this movie does it well,"Love the way the movie handles the age of wondering about sex, where it takes 3 boys, and how each of them handlesome issues that real grown up life has in it. Melanie Griffith is beautiful and delivers the lines in a way you wishyou could've heard for real when you were growing up. Definite must watch movie with your kids ages 10-12 and older."
1,Dopey,Dopey film about a kid who befriends a hooker. Full of bad acting and a ton of cliches this is one to avoid at all costs.
1,Lame!,"I agree with the reviewer who said ""avoid at all costs"". Melanie Griffith's limited acting skills aside, the script is pathetic. This type of film about the 'hooker with the heart of gold' has already been done (and better) in ""Pretty Woman"". If the boys in the story had been a bit older, this might have worked as a teen-sex comedy (a la ""Risky Business""), but the result is just plain dumb! The scene in the classroom where Frank (the main kid)gives a sex education presentation using Griffith as a visual aid was downright offensive - did he think he'd get an 'A' on that? Frank is supposed to be the hero of the movie; do 'good' kids (how old is he, 11 or 12?) go propositioning strange women on the streets of Pittsburgh with money they've obtained through selling porn magazines? Meanwhile, the scenes of his best friend's father seeking out Griffith for a tryst were not funny at all and just added yet more sleaze to this already repugnant flick. To sum it up in one word: Pass!"
2,Just doesn't work out,"The movie is supposed to be funny, but just doesn't cut it.No, I'm not getting up on some hypocritical high horse of holiness and accusing the movie of ""immorality"", what turns me off to it is that just doesn't come together.The kids are too young, the premise too lame, it just doesn't work out.Spend your milk money elsewhere!!"
1,More Like Milk of Magnesia,"A 90 minute visual laxative. Complete with stool softening and bowel cramping. Last time I saw a plot this thin was at Karen Carpenter's gravesite. Seriously though, this movie sucked hoof. And not like horse hoof or donkey hoof. We're talking moose or maybe even hippo hoof.Ay, mi estomago!"
4,"Good movie, at a great price.","Do not turn this movie down. Melanie Grifith is at her best as a hooker who gets thrown into a diffrent life, and is very charming in her roll. Harris lights up the screen yet again, and shows he knows which movies to be in. Milk Money is a great movie, that believe it or not, is good for the whole family. You won't regret seeing this movie!"
5,Milk Money,"I thought this movie had everything,it was funny,romantic,and had some drama.I don't think Melanie Griffith looked any better,she was absolutly cute in this movie,she played a fantastic role in this movie.As did Ed Harris,I feel they complimented each other in this movie,and I would recommend this movie to my friends and my family. ABSOLUTLY TERRIFIC!"
3,Not what I expected,Image clarity is somwhat lacking in clarity and there is more image distortion than I had expected. Color is good but the sound system quality is not good.
2,Burn-In,"My girlfriend bought one of these at Best Buy and she's taking it back. It's got burn-in with a distracting vertical line about 4"" in from either side."
3,Sound system IS NEEDED,"I have CableVision.I agree with Brenda,something is wrong with the sound. When you change the (regular non-HD)channels, it takes about 10 seconds for the sound to come on. HD channes are aok. I guess I have to purchase a sound system or something. I also agree that ""Image clarity is somwhat lacking in clarity and there is more image distortion"" than I had expected too. Color is good but the sound system quality is not good. Ambilight is terrific!"
1,Wouldn't do it again.,"I purchased a 42"" Philips Ambi Light Plasma TV Model #42PF9631D/37, during the last week of September 2006. The TV stopped working the 1st week in November 2006, 6 days after the 30 day return policy expired. The 12 month warranty means they get to keep trying to fix it. We're going into our 3rd month now, and the TV still is not working. 36 days it was working, 66 days it has not. You do the math. It is now January 15th, 2007, and I still do not have a TV that works. I would not recommend purchasing this TV . When it worked, it had a great picture but now it has no picture. If you like to gamble, I say go for it! But if you don't like to pour money down the drain, then don't do it...I won't do it again."
3,Not as good as its title,"When I saw the title of the book, I thought it would be a good aid for me in my highschool physics teachings. Some of the demos are not explained in detail, and it is hard to find (at least for me)some materials that are listed by the author for the demo. However, the ideas have been serving as the starting points for me, after some modifications (and spending a few minutes to understand the setting) I could use them in my class. Alright, it is not a tough job, even may be helpfull, but be aware of the fact that you might find some demos hard to implement."
5,"yeah, it's great!","i didn't write it, i only bought it, but it's still great just like the other reviewer said. darn fine soundtrack, WELL worth the going price."
1,This book was a disappointment,"There were many contradictions to the Gospel . The book describes the mother of Jesus as an elderly lady at the crucifixion . Mary was probably in her 40's . Mary Magdalene is described as stating that it is Monday morning and the Lord has been in the grave 3 days . ( Easter Monday ? ) On finding Jesus in the garden , Mary is described as embracing him tightly where the Gospels state Jesus forbid her to touch him . The Bible tells the stone was rolled away from the tomb . The author has Jesus walking through the stone . The author has Jesus and the 2 others crucified with him being hung on 3 different sides of the same tree rather than being nailed to 3 seperate crosses . This book was meaningless to me ."
3,Worth reading,"If you want to know the facts about how and why Jesus Christ was crucified and rose again, read the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in the Bible.But author Gene Edwards creatively tells the story in this book as if from Jesus' point of view. I found the book thought-provoking because it gives a new perspective to the story.In the second part of the book, the four gospels are combined to tell the full story, from Jesus' betrayal to his resurrection."
2,"Insightful, Weird, Bad on Kindle","I have enjoyed reading many of Gene's works, primarily the First Century Diaries. I found this book to be a good read, full of interesting insights, up until the strange emergence of a girl from the tomb. I'm sure this is Gene's metaphor for the bride of Christ, the church, but it was still weird.The Kindle format of the book is very poor Odd line breaks abound (mid-word, mid-sentence, and mid-paragraph). Chapter headings show up in strange places and many chapter headings are missing (the first chapter heading I saw was #21). Finally, the title of the book appears in the midst of paragraphs throughout the book. All in all it makes for a difficult read."
1,Do I have to give it a star?,"This product contians LYE... so much for the benifits of olive oil. It leaves your skin feeling dry. Also not the shipping: twice what you pay for the soap! Oh and they guarntee the product, if you return it unopened, it'll cost more to return it than you paid for it. Now I remember why I stopped buying things on the internet."
1,2 days,Read this book in two days. Pretty bad when all these fathers and mothers have to write books like this to establish their belief. To be arguing over God with your child is a twisted idealism that reeks of narcissim. This should have been agreed upon before the relationship and if two adults cannot agree or do not agree on worship then why did you have children? Books can seem immature and childish and this book was both.
5,Finney was a Christian who was not afraid to be responsible for his own actions as those who slander him seem!,"I read the autobiography of Finney and found him to be a man who loved and served God and did not buy into the calvinistic lies that a Christian should not be responsible for his own actions.... for others to tear Finney apart as heretic is disgraceful from a so called believer! .......... examine your own heart... as for the slandering review of Finney.... you show no grounds yet you slander a brother!?!?!?! I am sure ""Michael Horton"" or the one hiding behind ""a customer"" are not one of those humble CALVINIST who declares ""GRACE TO ALL!"" and who would NEVER tear apart another brother (but build them up) if they did not agree with their theology....or burn them at the stake as ""Saint Calvin"" did....or would they.... as a good calvinist once told me when ask if God sends babies to hell ......the reply..... ""only God knows"".....????"
1,Finney does not belong in this book series,"The Heroes of the Faith series has proven to be a good introduction to the lives of historical saints. The inclusion of Charles Finney in this series is nothing short of embarrassing. ""No single man is more responsible for the distortion of Christian truth in our age than Charles Grandison Finney."" -Dr. Michael HortonHe's a heretic plain and simple, and I do not understand why many modern Christians continue to place him on a pedestal. This biography does not even touch upon the controversial nature of his unorthodox teachings."
2,Alternative opinions - Alternative book.,"This book has become something of a 'collectors item' in recent years, albeit, in my opinion, not through its content matter. Holiday cleverly produces anecdotal evidence to support his 'giant slug' or 'paranormal' theories, but, in many instances, research into some of this evidence produces no such incidents to support his case. Holiday was very much part of the 1960's campaign to find any 'hitherto unknown creature' which may lurk in Loch Ness, however, this work seems to lose the plot midway through its pages, and has, in truth, created greater ambiguities in recent years through its lack and inaccurate sources of reference. As a reading volume, not recommended, as an alternative theory, recommended."
2,Nessie isn't a worm.,"I made the mistake of trying to read this entire book and to understand what the author was getting at. Honestly, while the idea is definitely 'alternative'/off the wall to other ideas about Nessie, the idea is ridiculous. I regret wasting my time reading a book by someone who is convinced Nessie is some sort of giant aquatic worm/slug."
4,Excellent!,"This book describe elemental and deep skills of dyeing in plastic bags. Is not theoric. I'm sure the author has dyed in his home whith the skills explained. Moreover the book talk about organitation of dyes, fixing olours, tye-dyeing, etc..."
5,great book,Have been tie dying for years but this book adds a new dimensionwith lots of new ideas....Joyce K.
5,Perfect Vacation Planner,"On 5 trips to 4 of the islands, I've consistently found that this guidebook steers me in the right direction, and leads me to some out of the way places. The listing of B&B's & condos is extensive, if you are more interested in hotels, the Fromers guides have better listings. This book provides directions to some sights you would almost definitely miss otherwise. For example, on the drive to Hana there is a lovely swimming hole (with waterfall) about 30 meters from the road but with no signs leading to it. I would never have found this, and it was a higlight of the drive. Numerous other examples (this is one of the few books with details about Molokai), but the bottom line is that while most of the guidebooks list identical sights, this one goes into much more detail. If you are looking to lose the crowds and find some quiet places on your own, you need this book."
4,Great CD,"I know that they looked a little stupid, but there music was great. They came in the era of the Hair Bands, that I love! I enjoyed there musci and still do."
1,What were they thinking?,"Nelson brothers are not talented, and they are just pretty boys trying to be Metal. I am sorry but there more pop then Metal and a bunch of 'Posers""(I hate that word), they try to be metal cause of the long hair, but it neevr worked, there just pretty boys, its garbage."
5,great book,"This is truly a great book. It may not be great as in deep and spiritual, but great as in really, really fun to read. It is too bad that this book is out of print. It deserves to be a bestseller."
3,Good Game...but VERY tough.,"This game does play out alot like Contra.The graphics are REALLY good,especially for an NES game.The storyline was a bit weak I thought.I just don't understand how Joker can come to life,after being killed in the first game.For those of you that don't know,this is supposed to be a ""sequel"" to the first Batman ""movie"" NES game.It doesn't make much sense to me.Other than that.The music is good,along with the sound effects.The main problem I found with this game,was it was just too dang HARD.The first level is pretty easy to get through,but after that,it is VERY challenging.Give this game a try,only if you're a TRUE Batman fan and a HARDCORE gamer."
4,great motivation,"Plenty of great cadences, these should get anyone motivated while jogging or running....even working out. Will bring back memories to those who served in the armed forces. A good spread among the services, the cadences are great motivation."
2,"Not a useful book, but not many alternatives either...","This book is fine for explaining Unicenter to a Manager/Directory and for getting an overview, but is USELESS in trying to gain deeper understanding of the product from a systems engineering point of view. The number of good quality screen shots is a nice touch, although the material is hopelessly outdated.There don't appear to be many titles available on Unicenter, which is unfortunate because it is an extremely powerful and scalable enterprise management tool. Still, I would only recommend this book for managers and directors, not for systems engineers."
2,"Extremely ""Salesy"". Not In-Depth At All","This book is okay to read in your spare time if you lack ANY other material. But I would strongly advise against purchasing it as a reference. I normally hold high expectations of QUE books, but this one totally missed the mark. Almost half the back is one long advertisement for the various outside options available for Unicenter. It would be like buying a book on Microsoft Windows where half the pages were devoted to advertising other Microsoft products. Hopefully, major improvements will be made in future revisions."
2,Unicenter Starter Kit,"This is a VERY generic beginning manual for Unicenter. If you are looking for explanations of how to do something, this is not the book for you. This book for the most part tells what the application can do but does not give any examples of how to do it."
4,Good High Level Conceptual Review with Examples,Well organized chapters. Good basic information. Color graphics and screen shots a plus. NT Centric vs. other platforms supported by TNG. Limited coverage of the many TNG Options. Highly recommended as a TNG primer.
1,Superficial; typical Que publication.,"Until O'Reilly comes out with a UniCenter book, this is sadly all you will be able to buy. Typical Que coverage of a topic; lighthearted, outdated, whimsicle, and very worthless. I have reviewed many Que ""Pulp-Computer"" publications and this one is on par with what they have produced in the past. UniCenter is a complex topic and this book completely misses the boat. If you are studying for a UniCenter designation or are implimenting UniCenter at your site, you will surely fail to find any meaningful answers in this worthless waste of trees. I have both implimented CA UniCenter and have taken the certification exams and can tell you that you will find no help in this book."
1,In The Mood - Big Band's Greatest Hits CD,Typical repertoire played by most every high school and college big band in the world. Boring.
4,"Uneven Collection, Beautifully Illustrated","Like the other reviewer, I picked this one up for ""Thurnley Abbey"" which is one of the scariest ghost tales going. While I was disappointed (at first) that it was the straight story with a few illustrations, I will say the illustrations were well done and I am glad to have the story permamently in my collection. The other stories varied wildly. My favorite was ""Gone"" which is subtly creepy: no gore, no blood and NO EXPLANATION. You are left to your own devices as to what happened and the story is the more bone chilling for it. On the other hand, that story in which a man tells a young boy a story about a haunted house was ho-hum while the Tattoo story was disturbing. (And, in a perverse way, quite amusing.)I'm not a fan of all the styles of artwork here--some of it was too dark and hard to look at. On the overall, though, if you like ghosts and the creepies, you'll want this in your collection."
3,"AWIT is good, but the others are marginal","To be fair, AWIT is refreshing in some sense. It is also quite dated. Read the other reviews for the good points. Maybe the books were written during the cold war or maybe the author grew up during woodstock - to her love solves everything. Well, it mostly works in the first book AWIT but the meaning of love has become trivialized in the second book, AWITD. ASTP deals with men's violent and greedy nature. There are many things I don't like about ASTP, esp. the ""eyeing her greedily"" part. Books for 9-12 year olds can do without such references... Such references worsen in the 4th book, MW.Read the first book and maybe the second. Third and Fourth books not recommended at all. If you end up getting the set like I did, save the last two books till your child is over 15."
1,A terrible disappointment,"After buying and reading this book to my son based on approving reviews, we were terriblly disappointed. Anti-climatic, shallow, and incomplete are some of the discriptions that come to mind. What a horrible mix of science and myth for a young mind, or any mind for that matter. The potential for this to be a excellent work of science fiction was lost on several occasions. The author tried to bridge science and religion without any supported charater developemment. The notion of absolute evil and absolute good was also just put out there for the reader to presuppose without reason or development. We felt this book to be a great dissappointment."
3,"Loved them then, not so sure now","A librarian recommended these books to me when I was pretty young - I loved them and searched for and read all of Ms. L'Engle's books. I reread them in the last few years and found some of the assumptions disturbing. Essentially they are about neglected lonely children who have great regard for their brilliant parents (whose brilliance I suppose excuses their neglect.) When I read them, being a lonely neglected kid myself, these books struck a chord in me, but I found them painful to reread."
4,not to shabby,This cd really surprised me. The sticker said sounds like thrice and saves the day. Well i thought that could be a good combination. But as i listen to the album; it sounds nothing like thrice and very little like saves the day. It more like story of the year but with more talent. This cd has some great breakdowns and great hooks. Not the most original cd i've ever heard but if u want good emo than this cd is for you.
3,An OT Commentary with the NT in Mind,"A decent commentary considering the task of trying to commentary the Old Testament in one volume. Although this could have been two volumes or more and been much more thorough, there are plenty of references to the New Testament which is helpful."
3,Decent Reference,I bought this book with the expectation of certain areas in the old Testament that would give me more insight but it did not. Whenever there is something that you come across in the OT that does not make immediate sense this is a good book to have clear explanations but not too in depth.
2,"John Walvoord's ""The Bible Knowledge Commentary""","This is a must for any Christian wanting to get the most out of Bible study. Written in layman's language, easy to read and absorb. A definite good buy."
5,The Bible Knowledge Commentary (Old Testament),"This is an excellent resource book for anyone who wants a sincere understanding of God's written Word. I have used this book for years and wanted three of my close friends to benefit from such a wonderful source of information. You really do want to also purchase The Bible Knowledge Commentary (NEW TESTAMENT) also. You will not be disappointed in this investment. I highly recommend this book, not based on price, but my own personal experience with these books. Five stars and more!!!"
5,Awesome quality - like new,"Used books are the only way to go, especially if you are on a fixed income. I will continue to buy in this manor for all future purchases"
5,May be best commentary set made.,"This is the 4th or 5th set I have purchased. It may be the best commentary set made. I am not a pastor, but, rather an encourager and supporter of pastors. One of my former pastors, a very scholarly man, rated this set very high. This set, as have several others, will be taken to a pastor in the country of Fiji in January, where several other sets have been distributed in the past. Besides being of high quality, having only 2 volumes makes it reasonable to pack in my luggage."
5,A must read for any manager,"Great book. The book contains some great ideas which are presented in an easy to read manner. The central idea is actually quit simple, but you'd never think of it. This book changed the way I approached performance management systems."
4,good jams,"Brick was one of those bands that brought the goods from the studio. dusic,ain't gonna hurt nobody and feelin happy are still bumping jams. Brick had a feel good funk vibe that they had there own bag. they made the flute jams funky and the Grooves were tighter than a Pimps Money Clip. strong arrangements,grooves and vocals that were crisp and sharp."
5,Love these,"These glasses always produce many smiles and giggles at Christmas. Adults and children love them. They are great fun. I rated the toy 3 stars for educational and 3 stars for durable, but I didn't buy them to be educational or durable. I bought them for fun and they are very fun."
4,"Oh, what fun!",I purchased the 3-D Holiday Glasses as a Christmas Eve surprise for my young nieces and nephews. They wil get such a kick out of looking at the Christmas tree and seeing the shapes. The glasses fall into the cool category. I will let you know the responses of the young ones after 12/24/11.
4,Fun for everyone put down your tech toys,"This is just plain fun. We shared them at several holiday parties and the adults as well as kids of all ages enjoyed these simple but fun specs. I was really surprised to see the kids put down their new tech toys, DS, itouches, wii, to go exploring with the specs on. It just goes to show some of the simple things in life are the best. These magic specs are a great value in today's world of hi tech high priced gadgets. We plan on using them for years to come and we have several other image specs we are planning to use for an upcoming dinner party..."
3,Christmas lights glasses,very cute glasses! make those Christmas lights even more magical with these glasses- my kids love them! A great stocking stuffer or class gift. They aren't very durable since they are made of paper and tear easily- fortunately we had back-ups with the 12 glasses but be ready for some tears and to go through several pairs.
5,Das Rheingold,A wonderful introduction to the Wagner Operasfilmed at Bayreuther Festspileunusal sets but beautiful music and production
4,A pleasant book for the intermediate birder,"The hard core will find little new in this book, but intermediate birders looking to improve their skills will enjoy and profit from the short essays. The author's style is easy and pleasant, reminding me a bit of Milton White's low-key (if not low-affect!) ""Listen, the Red-eyed Vireo,"" a work Newberry cites several times. The final section, on leading successful bird trips, is likely to be the most practically useful (perhaps even to more advanced birders), but the sections on field craft can also be read with profit by the ambitious and the befuddled. The central section's ""philosophical interlude"" is no less well written, but not as incisive as, say, Levine's ""Lifebirds"" or Alan Powers's fine ""Birdtalk.""I was particularly pleased to see the American Birding Association and its publications praised and recommended.A good book for birders on the cusp of advancement!"
3,better books out there,"This one was a little boring and rambling, sort of like listening to your grandfather's stories about birding in the ""old days"". Pere Dunne's book is a lot better."
1,Patronising book!,"I was greatly cheered when I initially started to read this book, as I felt that it may well offer insight into my mother-in-law's strange and passive agressive behaviour. But, as I read on, I discovered that a man should never try to write a book about a subject that he obviously cannot relate to. It was very black and white, not allowing for differences in personalities.I think the crunch came for me, when Dr Joseph Morris stated that women should be raised to look after the home and family and make good wives! NEED I SAY MORE!If you are a daughter in law after answers, help, coping mechanisms etc, then I HIGHLY recommend ""Toxic In-laws"". Written by a woman and with a practical, no nonsense approach. It helped me immensely!Dont bother with this title, by Dr Joseph Morris!"
4,TOO BAD THE MOVIE LOOKS LIKE A PILE OF...,"but the soundtrack is like a little indie slice of cuddle-happy niceness. i can't believe THIS music was attatched to this movie. how weird. oh well. this is a nice selection of popular ""indie"" bands. the postal service song is soooo great it hurts. this soundtrack is like the musical equivalent to an outfit composed of: converse ""chucks"", a vintage t-shirt, polyester pants, a cardigan sweater, and unwashed hair. oh, and a messenger bag covered in band pins. but like, in a good way. kind of. i guess."
3,music,"It was fine but I was disappointed that original soundtrack by Cold Play was substituted by a diff artist/group although they didn't do too bad,"
4,Nice variety - very indie for a soundtrack,"I enjoyed this CD very much. It has some great ""sex"" music too!"
1,depressing,"it makes me feel very hopeless to find that múm is on this soundtrack. i am willing to sacrifice mogwai, +/-, sure, but why did they have to defile múm? WHY?"
1,Sounded all the same after awhile,Liked it the first go around then after awhile all the songs sound the same. Get the Garden State CD....a bit better.
3,Not bad if you're open to new things,"This cd, after Garden State, was kind of a let-down for me. I don't know if it had anything to do with the fact that I didn't see the movie, but I don't plan on seeing it anytime soon so I guess we'll never know.Anyways, like I already said, if you're open to hearing new things you'll probably like this album alot. It is a fairly good soundtrack, the Postal Service covering Phil Collins is awesome. I'm also a fan of Mum's We All Have A Map of the Piano, which is an awesome song. Mum is an awesome band though, so it should be expected.Well I may not be the biggest fan but again, if you're open to new things, you might be a fan of this album, so give it a shot. What's the worst that could happen?"
5,Great Product,I have always had good luck with Desenex products and will always buy and use them. I recommend them to anyone.
2,Still itching...,"People rave about this foot fungus product, but the itching were the burning are still an issue. I've moved on to other treatments, which are working much better for me..."
5,Informative yet accessible,"As someone who has felt rather hopeless about the world economic and environmental situation, I found this book eye-opening. The author draws on an extraordinary number of fields of knowledge to craft a story that is wide-ranging and profound in its implications. It really changed the way I think about our planet's future. What's fun is that it delivers all this information in a way that's not textbooky; Nuess creates a story that is touching in a very human and individual way at the same time that he addresses global concerns most lucidly. I recommend this book highly. I'd like to see everyone read it, as it's a book that gives you hope and gets your brain moving in new and exciting ways."
5,Rewarding Journey,"I really like the setting of an informal family gathering, which takes place just after 9-11, that Nuess uses to forge together so many important themes. I like the characters and enjoyed traveling with them on their heartfelt journey through today's turbulent world. Through them, Nuess develops perspectives on ecology, science and technology, human and social relationships, the history of critical world events, and the impact of globalization. He weaves these themes into a rich, complex but clear and sensible world view. The journey took me through daunting, hope-defying scenarios and helped me make sense of them one-by-one until the whole puzzle came into focus. I really value the solution-focused thinking that helped me build a sense of direction and optimism. I understand how a Global Plenty is both achievable and necessary for lasting peace. This book is carefully crafted, quietly passionate, and deeply invigorating!"
5,"Almost 1,000 pages of detail","While only specialty collections will be able to justify the expense of this lovely reference, those with strong studies in science and nature will want to include Raptors Of The World in reference or university collections: it covers the raptors of the world, with each species receiving small color illustration by adult, juvenile and selected immature plumage. Almost 1,000 pages of detail on habits, habitats and raptor classification pack an intriguing guide."
1,Kindle version is low resolution,"As a falconer I love this book and recommend that for all my friends, but I was very disappointed with the Kindle edition, the plates are scanned in low resolution and you can't see the details of the drawings and reference numbers even in a new iPad with retina display. Paperback version is the best raptor identification book and deserves five stars, Kindle edition is worthless. If a new high resolution version become available let me know."
5,"If its not in here, then its not known.","This book is full of excellent colored plates as well as biological and ecological information. Also, the distibution maps are easy to read and often available with both the plates and the text. Highly recommended for the general birder to the seasoned ornithologist. The only drawback to this book is it's size...it's not field friendly."
3,Buono (quasi),"La sovracopertina del libro si presenta parzialmente rovinata perché il libro non è stato imballato in modo adeguato. L'orribile ordine di spedizione è stato INCOLLATO sulla sovracopertina e le tracce sono andate via solo con molta fatica (e parzialmente rovinando la sovracopertina).Per il resto, il volume è in ottime condizioni."
3,Raptors of the World,"The book is very specific abour hawks, falcons, vultures, etc and very good. However I am a owl lover. The book did NOT haveanything about owls. Are owls not raptors. Yes, they are!the book is titled Raptors of the world but DOES NOT have anything about owls. I will keep the book for ""hawk"" information but I am also looking for a book about Owls of the world."
2,paid full price for broken spiral binding,"Broken spiral binding on top & bottom of book, therefore pages keep falling off as you turn them. If it was half off or something, I could live with it. But when it is full price and described as in perfect condition but not, then that is not fair."
3,I don't understand the ending...or the plot,"Firstly, congrats on finishing it.The visuals are decent and the quality of effects are expected. I don't understand the ending and I really don't understand the story, but it's a decent endeavor. I found it worth the $1.00 are paid.After Googling, I found out that it's the 3rd installment of a 3 part story, but it really doesn't hold up on it's own as a story. It's very much a film school-like project.Additional Comment: My wife and I didn't like the fact that they stepped on bug for a film project. It was a roach, but even the film industry finds other solutions than killing on film. Hire a cg person next time."
5,Great Book,If you like Drizzt books you will love this books - I have read over 100 fantasy books.It stars a Dark elf of sorts that uses a sword.
1,"Listed ""Workbook/Lab Manual"" to Accompany Insieme","I was VERY disappointed with the service from this Amazon member. I purchased a listed item for over $40.00 and received an item that was totally different than the one described. Instead of being sent the Workbook/Lab Manual, I was sent the TEXTBOOK (which I had already purchased). I have since decided to sell the textbook at school, but it was a huge hassle to find another Workbook/Lab Manual. I would suggest only purchasing items that are accompanied by a photo from this member."
1,Adobe Should Pay the Reader to Sell this Book,"This book as a self help self paced guide to learning the program falls far short of teaching. The book and the lesson plans leave out important imformation about GoLive. If you're using a PC, even if you unlock the lesson plans 2 of the chapters don't work. If your following their Steps 1-5 process they forget to tell you about steps 2 or 3 in more that one instance, leaving you to figure out the process. Adobe's technical writers wrote this book, but it's obvious they never had to use it. In several of the chapters you need to defer to the users manual or online help to decipher what they want you to do. I'm using this book in a college classroom where my opinion is shared by all in attendance. I've used a lot of self help books, this one I wouldn't recommend to anyone! I think Adobe should owes me a refund!"
5,Step By Step,"Adobe software, the cornerstone ofthe desktop publishing industry, has issued a superior product and this is a superior instructor. Follow these step and create easy, sharp and FAST web sites.The interface with this book is so precise that there is little to no room for error."
3,The Doctor caught in political turmoil,"A decent adventure, filled with lots of descriptive action and gory expolsions. If you liked the television stories that were focused on Earth, with the Doctor working with the British government to stop an alien takeover, then you will most likely enjoy this book. The political strategizing by the Prime Minister and the Soviet Priemere gets in the way of the sci-fi aspects, but I will admit that I was never a big fan of the Doctor/UNIT stories. (If I wanted a James Bond story I'd go elsewhere!) Mr. Richards does do a good job of characterizing the 4th Doctor and Harry. (I wish Sarah Jane had appeared in more than the first few pages). If you prefer your Doctor Who stories to center around lots of time traveling, foreign places, and mythology you should check out Richards' missing adventure ""Sands of Time""."
2,Ripping yarn but badly written,"Richards describes overmuch, tends to use all of his research, isn't all that good at characterization, and, frankly, isn't all that good of a writer - his supposed article by (professional journalist) Sarah Jane is something she'd probably be ashamed of. That being said, he does know how to write ripping yarns, and particularly climaxes. So I'll forgive him a lot for that. However, Sarah Jane makes but a cameo in this one, which is disappointing since that's why I bought it.Basically another largely pedestrian novel in the series, though at least more straightforward than the full-of-itself Interference, which I read previously."
3,More of the same from Spillane,"Private Dick Mike Hammer is on the case of the murder of a safe cracker who left behind an orphan. Hammer shows his softer side by adopting the boy and is rewarded for this altruism in the end. In his search for the killer Hammer enlists the aid of a beautiful blonde, a beautiful brunette, kills several people, butts heads with the DA, beats up others and is in turn beaten up.Hammer is a detective, who is very ruthless, stubborn, always sleeps well after sending someone to the mourgue, and unlike Phillip Marlowe, gets to sleep with all the girls.."
2,"a rather poor, confused effort by Spillane..","'The Big Kill' by Mickey Spillane simply drowns itself in a hopelessly complex plot after starting off so promising (.. a young father seemingly runs off to get himself shot by thugs, leaving his orphaned child into the care of Mike Hammer, private investigator and overall studpuppy). Beyond this Spillane's profuse use of tough guy talk is so over the top it's almost laughable.In many ways 'The Big Kill' is a poor imitation of what a 1950s crime novel should be. If it wasn't for the popularity of its author the book would not have made it past the first printing, assuming it would have been published at all."
4,Good Stuff!,An enjoyable and 'manly' scent! I am about halfway through the bottle. A little bit goes a long way; three sprays does it for me and it lasts through most of the day. Will purchase again.
1,Keep in stock,It would be nice if this seller would make these more available. I have signed up for more then 3 months and have not gotten notification that they are available. I would say what is the point in having this item here if you can't get it. Kinda of like false advers.
2,Couldn't Finish It,"There are very few books I've started and not finished, and this was one of them. I gave it two stars because I did make it halfway, and because I am an adult who was previewing it for her preteens. The age group for which it is written may enjoy it, but if they have read the Percy Jackson series, or the Gregor the Overlander series, I don't see how this could be of much interest."
5,excellent book worth reading,It is a great book for all ages. I especially recommend it for young adults/ teens. it is hard to get into at first but then you cant put it down.
5,The Shadow Theives. Elli Burns,good book with some good laughs and suspensfull moments. Good for the younger ages and Greek myth fans all around.
1,Please.,Awful. That's the only way to describe it. There are a 100 other books in the same genre that are a million times better. She talks down to her reader. It insulted my intelligence.
1,The Superficial Deleuze,"There will always be a need for good readings of Deleuze, but not for one that glosses his philosophy with as many commonplaces, cliches, and indifferent remarks as this text. The key to explaining Deleuze, like the key to Deleuze's philosophy itself, remains in the examples, which are utterly lacking here. Readers can, and should, do better than this."
1,A Superficial [mis]Reading,"Screw this chump, read Brian Massumi's book instead (Capitalism & Scizophrenia: Deviations from Deleuze and Guattari). Massumi translated 1000plateaus and is so much more than a preeminent French translator: He is a righteous theorist himself and seems to be just about the only person who understands Deleuze's thought well enough to treat it in this capacity.I cannot overemphasize what a despicable, disappointing, and reductive book this is. It was a waste of my money and time."
5,Khachaturian Concertos - Unjustly negelected.,"I've been listening to a lot of Khachaturian lately, and I'm amazed how beautiful his Violin Concerto is as well as his cello and piano concertos. I'd only heard the Leonid Kogan recording of the VCKhachaturian: Concerto for violin in Dm; Prokofiev: Alexander Nevsky, Op. 78and I treasured it, but Mordkovich's performance is excellent and Jarvi's support is exciting and well-captured. The cello concerto with Swallisch/Thomson is no less captivating. And if you don't know it, take a chance and listen to the Piano ConcertoKhachaturian: Piano Concerto; Gayaneh Ballet Suite; Masquerade Suite. It's time to stop of looking at mid-century Russian composers as victims/adherents of Socialist Realism and listen to their music as **Russian** music by Russian composers/artists."
1,Doesn't work,"First, let me just say that this item is a good idea. However, this particular product should be avoided at all costs. I received it as a gift.... Put batteries in it, and noticed that it would try to squirt at random times. The instructions, which are very minimalist, say not to put it near bright lights or a window. I tried it in several different places in both my bathroom and my kitchen and it would attempt to dispense randomly on its own. Not a good sign.My husband suggested I try loading it with soap anyway to see if it would make a difference. So I did. The dispenser won't dispense anything. Referred to the instructions again which suggested that the liquid loaded in it might be too thick and to try diluting it. So I did. It still won't dispense anything. The little motor goes but nothing comes out....even after trying to get it to dispense for about 5 minutes.I'm going to empty it and it's going to be returned. Save yourself the frustration and don't buy this product."
5,The Best Nintendo Game Ever Made!!,"I love this game. It is very addicting and exciting. I could play for hours and hours. This is definitely one of nintendo's best games. If you love classic car racing games, this one is for you. It is simple but fun."
2,Hopefully they've improved it...,"Just returned from Thailand this week. We used this book (although the cover photo is different, so perhaps we had the previous edition). Some of the bungalow info was different (i.e. unrecognizeable from the book description), but they change so fast that's to be forgiven in any guidebook. What really irked me was the crazy light orange text colour for headings and numbers - trying to read in dim Asian lighting or the back of taxi was extremely difficult. Also, I found the maps oddly placed. Good size, though, and the transportation info was accurate."
3,Charge is good until it's not,"This battery works well for so long as it's able to hold a charge. Memory issues arose after only a year of use, however, and I had to purchase a new one. I love my camera, but it's power supply leaves something to be desired."
1,Very Poor Quality,"Air cleaner worked for approximately one week then began to rattle extremely loud and night light failed. We purchased 2 units, one for our upstairs bath and one for a bath in the basement. Both units worked for only a week. If I could rate this product at 0 stars I would but the scale starts at 1. Please don't waste your money on this product!"
1,cheap yellow lights from a shoddy company (Viatek),"I purchased three sets of these to use during an indoor/outdoor party. I think rechargeable LED candles are a great idea, but these LED lights are made very poorly. There was at least one candle in every set that didn't work at all (a total of 4 candles from 3 sets that didn't work) and then a couple that keep very short lived charges and flicker out (within two hours) much sooner than the rest. I called an emailed Viatek with no response. After, the third call, someone picked up the phone and said that they would send replacements. They never did, and a follow up call went unanswered as well. Also, the yellow light emitted by these candles is very yellow compared to a real candle flame, it isn't natural looking. If you plan to mix yellow LED candles (like these) with real candles, the difference will be glaringly obvious. Go for a -warm- white LED candle as opposed to the yellow LED candle (they do exist)."
1,Good as a nightlight. Does not work.,"Let's just say that the flies in my house were not at all intimidated by this gadget. Nothing has changed, the flies just fly right in front of it and dont seem bothered by the ultrasonic waves. A fly swatter works better... Dont waste your money on this."
3,robs review spiders,"So far, I haven't seen any spiders around my house! or centipedes for that matter.ROB"
1,"Terrible Results, all three died...","This product seemed the ideal ion generator to use by my desk as I worked at the computer. However, the first one I got died within three days. The seller graciously refunded me my money as they had no more in stock. I ordered another from another seller and this one died within three weeks. When I told them what happened, they also graciously sent me a replacement without my even specifically asking them to do so. This third one died within 48 hours! I either have the worse of luck or this is just a bad product. I took apart the first one that failed but I could find nothing wrong on the inside, not that there were any consumer replaceable parts. At least, I could confirm that it had real looking insides! Well three strikes and I am out, I won't even try any of this product again and would be hesitant to even buy any of that brand."
5,Holiday in Israel music CD,"This is a wonderful Cd, very ""Jewish"" and uplifting! I love it!I had the audio cassette for many years and needed a CD, rather wanted the CD. i was very, very pleased with this product!"
3,Yup!,"First off, I beat this game's monkey ass on the day i got it (in just under 2 hours, if i would of played seriously i probably could of beat it in slightly under an hour). That being said, as a kid of 8-9(if i was still 8-9 years old)this game would of probably taking me just under a month. Its a very average platformer w/ medium-low difficulty and its certainly not nintenhard (if you want a platformer thats nintenhard and more, try the awesome Yo Noid (it took me 2 weeks of sporadiac play to beat). All n' All this game is cute & colorful & pretty fun and will provide a decent challenge for the kiddies and the novice platformer alike, i would recommend it.Grade: 3 stars (Good)"
5,A trip to the past,This game was my favorite when I was little. I remeber spending hours playing it. When I found the retro duo I had to get this game again. It is just as fun as I remember it! I definitly recommend to anyone wanting a fun game that children as well as adults can enjoy. Games were much less violent then.
4,Chip n dale nes,The chip n dale nes game is very cool it reminds me of the show I use't to watch I love it
5,Ok,"The product is really good, it was exactly what I expected the product is. I can recommend it to all who are interested in purchasing this item. The people should buy it because it's reliable..."
1,Not a good workout,"I bought this since I like the TV show. I thought it would be fun to dance and to learn Latin steps. I was soooo wrong! I thought the instructors were extremely boring. They lacked any enthusiasm. I couldn't wait for the DVD to be over. I even tried giving it a second chance, but I couldn't make it through. To stay motivated with exercise, I need something that keeps me excited and keeps things fun. This hardly even gets my heart rate up. I've purchased exercise DVDs where I'd like to turn the instructor's excitement down a couple notches, but this one nearly put me to sleep. I wouldn't recommend it at all."
3,Fun but not much enthusiasm,"I used to dance and I understand when you're a professional dancer how sometimes they teach as if everyone knows what they're doing and they're just providing the moves. However, for a widely distributed and commercialized work-out/dance video, they could've put on a better face. The moves were fun and I learned quite a few steps. Afterwards, I would actually have to do my other workout videos to feel like I exercised. Definitely great for beginners but if you have background in both dance and are active, this is not for you. Cheryl and Max could've provided more enthusiasm overall, though I'm still excited to watch them on the actual show...they seem to provide more enthusiasm there."
1,Boring,"I am so glad I only rented this video, because I can't image watching it again. It was so boring. The instruction is stilted and the music belongs in an elevator. The steps are shown separately and just repeated over and over, but never put into a routine. There is no sense of flow or cohesion. The dancers are pretty to look at, and obviously can dance. However, there is a point when the instructor says ""lets have some fun"", and the camera cuts to one the background dancers: her face is as animated as a corpse. She was just as bored as I was. The Dance off the Inches title is a much better DVD if you are looking for a ballroom flavored workout."
3,dance video,"It goes a little too fast for me, I am a total beginner. It seems like once I get the hang of it the work out will be good."
3,Harder than I ever thought it would be!,"When I watch Dancing with the Stars on TV, I admire how quickly the celebrities learn the steps and sometimes multiple dances in a week. I didn't think learning the samba or mambo would be so challenging. I didn't find the instructors really knew how to lead an exercize video. You don't get enough warning when it comes to the steps and it is hard to be motivated by their voices because they are reading off of cards or something.I also didn't find this to be a great cardio workout. It was fun but I'm kind of disappointed I bought it."
3,definitely not for people with no dance background,"I love the video but I have extensive dance background so I'm able to follow along well. My husband tried to do it with me and was totally lost. Though I love both Max and Cheryl on DWTS they are very boring as teachers and give awful directions. It's a great workout if you are familiar with dance and dance terms but otherwise it would be very frustrating and you'd probably just throw it on a shelf to collect dust. I'd say the only real positive for anyone that uses it is that it is incredibly customizable. You can select exactly what dances/warmup/etc you want to do which is really nice. Bottom line, it's decent for a dancer but not too good otherwise."
3,Haven't used it. Forgot I had it.,"This looks like a fun way to get exercise, but I haven't taken the time to learn it yet. I think I bought it mostly for my daughters."
2,good but fast,product is good but hard to follow because i think you get lost focusing on step and movement that you cant be loose like you should be when dancing
1,Would not give even one star.,"It is horrible. There is no cardio (it's not an exercise, so you would not get any results out of it) or dancing; only marching"
3,Disappointed Customer,The product arrived in great condition and there was no problem with quality. But the service was very poor. It took several weeks to get this item. I will probably not purchase here again because it took so long to get this item.
3,a bit too mild,"The music was OK, not really wonderful. I did not work up a sweat. I'm 64, and this was almost too easy."
3,Nice Instruction but very boring,"I was hoping this video would be a nice cardio dance video. I liked that it was very helpful in explaining the dance moves, but they never really danced to a full song. I would have liked it better if they had split it up with instructional and the actual dance."
2,"Fun moves in theory, poor execution by Cheryl and Maks","I really wanted to like this DVD for many reasons - learning fun latin dance moves, great cardio, and DWTS favs Cheryl and Maks. The moves/dances they are showing in and of themselves are fine. I did break a sweat and I could see how this would be a good variation to a workout regime.But Cheryl and Maks had NO ENERGY, they were monotone, and that on-camera enthusiasm that makes workout DVDs fun was just not there. and the dancers that were behind them looked like they were bored and wanted to leave. My enthusiasm slowly dwindled as the DVD went on....and on.The silver lining is that there is an option to show the routines with music and no commentary. I think I will learn the routines better and do that instead, just for the added workout boost."
2,Put them out of their misery.,Wow was this not only boring but just bad. The energy is so LOW it's like if they were forced to teach against their will.I am sorry I even bought it.
2,They are kidding right?,"I purchased this at WalMart.....waste of money. These people are professional dancers and if you have no dance experience you won't be able to do these excercise dance routines. Also they dance on a hard floor (not carpet) and the women are in HIGH heels. After a few days of attempting to follow these people, I put on 2 inch heels and followed a little bit better, but still got mixed up and couldn't follow, changes are too fast and like I said, no dance experience.....don't waste your money. Unless you want to spend most of your workout marching in place or stepping from one foot to the other. Definately not for the beginner or someone with two left feet."
2,Misleading,"If you want an acutal cardio workout, this is not what you want. Yes, it will get you off the couch and moving, but it will not make you sweat nor will it get your heart rate up where it should be for a cardio workout. I bought this to supplement my cardio routine and it will most likely just sit on the shelf. I discussed it with my trainer and she agrees that this is NOT a cardio workout, it is more of an instructional video."
3,Dancing with the Stars Latin Cardio Dance,"I think that this video is really fun. However, I think that it is kind of fast pace in some parts and extremely difficult to keep up with. If you have latin dance experience this would be a great choice for you."
3,maybe to old?,Love the video but had a hard time dancing with cheryl...she's way to fast... max is a little slower and i could follow along without any problem.I'm in shape but always looking for a new way to stay that way-I'm a young 54 but i think this video is not for all ages -They need to address this issue.
3,Lacking,"It wasn't what I had hoped, the energy level was low. The music was quiet and the instructors lacked energy- almost seeming unprofessional. ""Now I'm tired, so here's Maksim."" What??As mentioned there was alot of stepping from side to side, not enough to get my heartrate going. It was fun to learn the steps, but not hard enough work to qualify as even a rest-day workout for me."
3,Dancing with the stars latin cardio,"Overall I like the dancing aspect of the video, but I feel that the section of the video, when Cheryl is instructing needs more work. I think she is not clear enough, it feels as though she expects everyone to be a dancer. For example ""replace"" means nothing to me and should be explained before instructing the viewer to ""replace"", because I have no idea what that means in terms of the steps."
1,"All Instruction, NO sweat!!!","I do not think this video should be considered exercise. Of course, if you have never exercised, it is a good place to start. I did not even break a sweat with this video and it did not work my core. It did work my thighs, though. This is for beginners, intermediate or advanced would not get any benefits from this except to learn a few dance steps. I do, however, Like the instructors very much. Their ques are off from time to time, but over all they are decent instructors. The only reason I gave this a 1 star is because of the instructors."
2,Dancing with the Stars Cardio,"Not really cardio, I consider myself pretty active, I jog and play tennis and I wanted a CARDIO workout and that is not what I got."
4,highly recommend!,This is an awesome dance DVD for the beginner. If you love to dance and not feel like you are exercising this is a good one. If you know the dances and are physically fit you might be bored with it. I love it because I love to dance and I love Maks and Cheryl. It will be a while before I am bored with it as I am still trying to get all the steps down. I am sweating by the time I reach the really good cool down. I feel great afterward and look forward to doing it again. My only complaint is that there should have been more dances taught by Maks and Cheryl.
2,Quite disappointed!,"I'm a bit dance challenged and was hoping this would not only give me exercise but would teach. It was hard for me to follow for some reason. Anyhow, even if it's b/c I've got two left feet, they were not enthusiastic and it was even awkward at times...it felt very hurried and boring for them. I'm giving this two stars b/c of my left feet (my problem) and b/c I did like the very last segment. Still, I'm quite disappointed that these pros couldn't do better for something the non-pros will be doing at home. :("
1,poor cueing and couldn't wait for it to end,"I found the video to be poorly put together, have a lack of enthusiasm and horrible cueing. Coming from a fitness and aerobics background of over twenty years it was very frustrating to listen to the bored instructors not cue early enough to prepare the participant for change of step. Don't waste your money."
3,Not your typical workout video,"Most workout videos guide you through the moves so that you get them right and get the best workout. This one, however, just has a very rushed explanation of a few dances and then you're there trying to keep up. I'm a pretty decent dancer and I learn quick, but even this was hard to follow. Even some of the background dancers kept messing up and looking a bit confused sometimes. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad workout and I sweated like crazy, but you could get pretty much the same kind of workout just putting on some music and dancing like a fool. If you want to learn some basic latin dance moves, then this will be good. If you want an entertaining, good workout, go for Hip Hop Abs or something."
2,"Fun, but not a great aerobic workout","This workout is kind of fun to learn, but it's not a great aerobic workout for people that are in shape. Probably good for beginners though."
3,"Okay, but not spectacular","The Latin Cardio Dance DVD is so much better than the other ones from Dancing with the Stars that I decided to buy it. Unfortunately, it doesn't feel like an adequate workout. So, I only do it now when I have exercise time left over. This rarely happens. Seems I can always find a better exercise DVD to workout to."
2,"Too lame, terrible music","The DVD was disappointed. I just don't understand how anyone can be energized to ""dance"" the cha-cha or mambo or merengue if the music is so boring & repetitive!"
3,Not a great workout,I was so excited to try this when I bought the workout since I love dance workouts but something with this exercise DVD didn't quite work. There was a very akward feel to it and it just felt kind of quite and dull. I started this right after having a baby and I was very out of shape and not once through the whole video did I feel short of breath or like I was getting a really good cardio or muscle workout. In all it was just too easy. I lost interest very quickly and regret buying it now.
2,Not what I expected,"When I first watched a preview of this DVD, I thought ""great, now I can workout at home."" It was not what I expected. I do Zumba in the gym for an hour and by the time it's finished, I am sweating bullets! With this particular video, it is a slow progression and the breaks in between cause my momentum to decrease. It should be revised - take out the segways and really go for the gusto! I give it a 2 - I can workout for 30 minutes at home if I happen to miss a day at the gym."
3,move those hips,"Overall a pretty good product. It's a good cardio workout, but at times hard to follow. You won't get all these moves on the first run through, maybe not the first several run throughs. But Latin dance is a lot of fun, and I really like the fact that you can customize the workout, choose the dances you want to do.I like it."
2,Didn't love this...,...as much as I wanted too. The instruction from Cheryl is not great. Max is a little better.
3,Not my favorite...liked the original better,"I liked this DVD because it was customizable (you can choose 40 minutes of dancing and/or 15 minutes of toning with a 5 minute warm-up option) and I like a longer workout.I did not like this DVD because:1. There was a lot of standing and stepping with arms close. My heartrate monitor never made it to a full cardio workout.2. I thought that the instruction was just okay. Not enough advanced warning as to what was coming up next. Now we'll do a cha-cha and ""GO!""3. I thought the instructors were not as ""fun"" as the first DWTS DVD. They were monotone and almost boring. Not quite, but close.I really wanted to like this one because of the funtionality of it, but it didn't work for me....maybe for beginners?"
2,Lack Luster! Very disappointed!,I give this 2 stars instead of one because it does get the heart rate up and you do burn calories! But not at all what I espected! Cheryl and Max are not very good with their instructions. They both lack enthusiam about this work out. It's almost as if they were going through the motions because their locked into a contract or something! Especailly Cheryl! The Samba is the worst work out of all! At one point she goes entirely too fast like she's out on the dance floor with a partner and not instructing others! They both should have watched some other professional work out videos and learned how to instruct a dance class!
3,not as good as expected,"I have been fan of dancing with the stars, and really liked Cheryl. For me, the instruction was so-so, and the workout wasn't all too fun and engaging. As far as my background goes, I am a musical/dancer-type who has taken some ballroom although I am by no means a professional. I love ballroom, and was expecting much more from this DVD. Overall, I did get a good core workout, but the instructors were not as enthusiastic as I would have liked. I purchased Fitness with the Pros as well as the DWTS original video. I hope those better meet my expectations. Guess I'll have to find out!"
2,Skip it.,"Skip this DVD. It does not get your heart rate up unless you've done nothing but sit for a couple of years. You'll get the same amount of cardio walking to the fridge. The instruction is poor at best. The ""Samba"" section is the worst -- impossible to do on carpet. I am a seasoned dancer with a knee injury and found that particular section so frustrating I turned it off. Not worth a penny."
3,OK - Not able to do the moves on carpeting,The best part of this video is that Cheryl and Maks project their voices very well. They make it easy to follow the moves. However I have a carpeted home and doing these moves on a carpet does't work well. I even tried barefeet but that didn't work either. You need an uncarpeted area to really formulate the moves. These are a good workout but you need to have the right floor in your home. If I had a nice dance studio that would be perfect but I don't. That is my biggest disappointment is that I just can't do them in any room of my home - which was the whole idea of getting the DVD!
2,it's OK,"Not much cardio in this one. I thought it was too slow going. I was not a fan, although I like Maks and Cheryl in the video."
2,Not good,"I got this video to see if I wanted to order some of the other Latin workout/zumba tapes. I was pretty disappointed. The instructors don't seem to understand the nature of a workout video - you have to warm up, workout, and cool down AT HOME. Not everyone has a ballroom complete with wood floor to work with. The female instructor went way too fast to follow the up tempo steps. She acted like she was being judged on the show or something. The male instructor was better but all those spins are hard on the knees unless you have flooring like a dance studio.You do break a sweat (hence the 2 stars), but there are better videos featuring more competant instructors out there. Keep looking!"
3,Okay but hard to follow,This DVD is hard to follow and I do not really feel like I get a good workout.
2,"Dancing = no workout, Toning = some work","I dance salsa, meringue, and bellydancing, and can't afford a gym membership anymore so I thought a dance work out (like they do in the Zumba class) would be a nice addition to my jump rope and pilates videos. Not a work out at all! Didn't even break a sweat. The segments are too short and its boring. I still have the video though, because the the very end is a toning work out that I do with my jump roping workout. The toning workout is nice, I am sore the next day, but in general SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,No real instruction,"Although I did work up a sweat, this is not a video for people who do not know the dances. The ""instructions"" are given once, no close up on the feet, no direction about weight shifting, no walking through the steps. The steps are demonstrated once from a distance (ie: you can see the entire body of the instructor), then almost immediately they are going into up tempo and it is up to you to follow along! It is pretty obvious the instructors do not know much about instructing. You could work up the same sweat just putting on the samba, mambo or cha cha music and doing your own thing."
2,More and more compilations,"Get Smashes, Thrashes & Hits instead of this. Smashes is more balanced and it also has songs of their early years.If you LOVE their eighties' period, then get this album.If you already own the kiss' collection or the box set, there's no reason to get this. Don't waste your money on a cover."
4,Kiss without makeup were still producing great songs.,"There is some pretty good songs here.These wre the days when good old Eric Carr was at the skins.Man did he thump those bongo's to a T.When he was there Kiss had a different sound,and it gave what i think was new life,and a different energetic sound to this band.I quite liked Kiss in the 80's,but i'm as diehard as you get.These days there is nothing new,but reflecting on there old music,its realy good to hear this era of Kiss.I would of given this Cd 5 stars if it had of had more than 12 songs.There is lots of songs i could of added to this collection from the same era.They picked 2 songs from each of the albums from Creatures through to Hot In The Shade.It was a realy good era for music from this band,which battled back after Ace and Peter left as well as removing the make-up.It appeared that their careers were on the line,but creativity stepped in and this is a partial reflection."
2,worn-out methodology,"The authors of this book begin by asserting that ""we fly no philosophical, political, or methodological colours."" They then immediately give the lie to this claim by launching into an attack of postmodernism and the work of Shapin and Latour. Such high-handed critiques of postmodernism would be a little more reasonable if the authors could display at least a small amount of evidence that they had read and understood the works they were attacking. Make no mistake, this book definitely does fly philosophical, political, and methodological colors, and those colors appear to be fairly conservative ones."
2,Not enthusiastic,"I bought and then returned this book. From the description I expected a guide with detail about the different schools and programs, as well as inside information on the schools. Instead, the book contains a couple pages about audition procedures (a much better description is in the Performing Arts Major's College Guide) accompanied by basic information that is easily available off of the school websites (location, number of students plus number of students majoring in the discipline, teacher/student ratios, etc.). It was impossible to tell which programs had a good reputation or better quality. Save your money, and get the information off of the school websites."
2,Robin Hoodwinked,"As an avid RPG fan, I had hopes of some pleasant times with Robin Hood. If you have seen the movie, you know the game. There are no hidden secrets, nothing to figure out, and not much difficulty to this game. Only beginning RPG players will enjoy this game. There is nothing memorable here!"
4,good practical and informative,"A real good book with a lot practical advice, but I am not 100% sure if the claims made will work. I will try to build some of his antennas.Can only recommend this book"
4,Three excellent books repackaged as a new novel.,"If you have already read many of Patricia Wrede's novels you may want to skip buying this one since it is really a repackaging of three previous novels: Shadow Magic, Daughter of Witches, and The Harp of Imach Thyssel. (I discovered this the hard way.) The novels themselves are quite good. Wrede's depiction of magic is very creative and succeeds in evoking a sense of mystery that sets it apart. The cultures of ""Lyra"" are intriguing and her characters have plenty of depth; her heroes have flaws and some of the villains aren't all evil. Each story is different, but each skillfully combines political intrigue, diverse personal motivations and significant cultural clashes to create a gripping, fast paced plot that operates on a number of levels. These three stories are well worth reading."
1,"depends on what kind of ""beginner"" you are...","i bought this video for my 63 year old mother who was interested in a ""beginner"" video that had weights. my mom is very agile and active but hasn't really ""worked-out"" minus a weight class at our local community center. i watched it after she attempted and failed to do many of the exercises herself. i thought that the intro was really good, explained the importance of working out, lifting weights, etc but the video itself was poorly executed and should not be advertised for ""beginners"". it was really fast paced and having so many people in the video was confusing. in videos i have done that are more advanced, they have people doing different levels which would have been more helpful here. if you are looking for a video for a beginner, especially in the over 50 range, i would recommend any of the videos by mirabai holland."
4,Didn't love it at first,At first i hated this DVD because Kathy Smith makes you work HARD. Over time as I became more familiar with the routine i really started to like it.You get two DVDs with workouts for both the upper and lower body and there's a hard version and a standard version of every move so you can tailor the workout to your skill level. You also need a few sets of dumbells and plenty of space to get the most out of the workouts.With this DVD I'm getting good tone in my arms and legs and I really enjoy doing the workout.
3,Good work out but VERY annoying instructor,The video is good at teaching you basic moves for weight training. However the instructor is very annoying and basically yells at you and hoots and hollers the while time. Not a motivating yell but just obnoxious and irritating. She also has a difficult time instructing transitions between moves.
4,Good beginner workout,I enjoy Kathy Smith's workouts. I am very happy with my order. It arrived on time and was the quality I expected.
5,Wired trumps wireless,I bought both the wireless and wired remotes for my new D80. Assuming you're close enough to the camera the wired remote works better...you don't need to tell the camera each time you want to use it.A small square of plywood attached to the button with double stick tape lets me activate the remote with a foot or tooth when I need to have both hands in the picture.
2,Worked fine at first but not anymore,I needed a cheap alternative to the more expensive shutter releases so I choose this. It worked great for awhile and then just started giving me the most grief. I would go with the name brand if you need reliability.
1,MA-G (118 inch) Remote Control for Nikon,I used this device for about one month before it failed to work. I guess you get what you pay for - cheap price for a cheap product.
5,Great cd,"This is one of the best cds I've ever bought. I'd say there is one superb song in jungle, one great one in that, and a bunch of very good ones. Great CD. Nickatina has been gaining popularity at a crazy rate, check this cd out. Bay area at its best."
5,Andre and Equipto tear it up,"Andre and Equipto are great together. this is by far my favorit cd out of all of andres. song #2 is the best song ive ever heard, and there arent any bad songs on this cd. this is a must buy for any rap fan, especailly anyone from the bay (thats where Andres from for any of you uneducated people out there). Andre and Equipto threw it down on this cd, its worth every penny."
1,"Use ""Database Design for Mere Mortals"" Instead","This is the first of the ""dummies"" books that I've used, and probably the last. The author introduces a lot of jargon and complicated models early on and then proceeds to use terms interchangably, leave models abstract that would have benefited from metaphors, and produces examples that he fails to adequately explain. When things become complicated, he demures, reminding the reader that this is, after all, only an introduction.Perhaps I would have put my inability to use this book up to my own inadequacy when it comes to things technical, but after reading Michael Hernandez's Database Design for Mere Mortals I realized that the dummies' book was needlessly technical and theoretical."
2,Ambiguous at best,"If your only interest is to gain a cursory understanding of database development than this is the book for you. If you are relatively unexposed to the world of database management systems (DBMS), database architecture and planning then this book will provide some insights, but in my opinion it definitely stops short of really helping the novice gain practical knowledge into the complex and somewhat confusing world of database designing. It dwells mostly in the lofty theoretical aspect and does not bring it down to earth. To few examples and the section on interviewing and creating a database profile is just plain vague as though based more on theory than experience."
3,Learning about databases,"I found this book to be useful for conceptualizing building a database. However, I found some sections about the constructing the ER diagrams and normalizing the relations to be less than clear. I would have like more examples and more diagramming of the process.SQL for Dummies by the same author is a better tutorial for DB development."
3,Quest,Pretty easy read. I was expecting more spiritual depth or contrast between western Christianity and native or hindu concepts than what was presented.
2,A Real Disappointment,"I liked the other three video productions in this series but this one was cheap compared to them. I like the fact the other videos had an integrity and obvious benefit to veiwers and the fact that the models were nude added to the sexiness of the videos. In this one the women introduce themselves and pose while doing some of the exercises. To me , that cheapens the production and takes away the value of the video. It's more like a porno. If they would maintain the standards of Nude Yoga, Nude Tai Chi, and Nude Stretching videos, I would have been much more impressed."
2,Zombies on Camera,"While the production quality is good, the females act like zombies following some forced script. There is no sense of their being present or spontaneous, so for me this fails as either provocative entertainment or useful training."
5,Fascinating mystery,"While this is not an exceptionally long book, there's a world of intriguing plotting going on. Inspector Lloyd and Detective Sgt. Hill have to do some clever interrogating and careful thinking to discover the one who took the life of wife-beater Graham Elstow."
4,Snowstorm murder,"I really enjoyed this British ""cozy"". Tight and plausible plotting, likable characters--I'm planning to read more of McGown's mysteries. Something not mentioned in the other reviews is that this story takes place during the Christmas season, during a snowstorm; there's a real wintry atmosphere. It would make a good Christmas gift for a mystery fan."
4,"Great product, strong scent","I used to buy this scent all the time and used it with the Tide Mountain Fresh scent and together, it was wonderful. However, for some reason, this fabric softener seems stronger than it used to and you get that ""Oooh, her clothes' scent entered the room before she did,"" look from everyone around you. It really does smell up your clothes that much so I have to put water in it before using it. Other than that, you can't beat the quality of Downy. Been using it for almost 30 years now and wouldn't have it any other way. Highly recommend!"
5,"Fantastic optics, period!","I have a set of $2,600 Zeiss binoculars that are only a couple of years old. These Carsons are better. Optics are just as good to the naked eye (and I've got pretty good eyesight), light gathering is comparable, and they are significantly lighter weight. Throw in a lifetime warranty and about 1/10th the price and you absolutely cannot beat these binoculars. I'm ordering another pair with a higher magnification because you can afford to do so at these great prices."
2,A big disappointment,This book needed an editor. It takes a long time to say anything. The writer doesn't seem very clear what he thinks about any of the big questions so he settles for remaining aloof and sounding vaguely superior to other critics.
4,my review,The book is good however the paper is to thin and it tears from its binding at the drop of a hat.
2,Mystery of...,"The title alone shows how careless this book is. Feather attempts to connect the Copper Scroll to Qumran. Even though the cave sits above the main highway linking Jerusalem and Dead Sea, and would have been an obviousplace to stash anything before fleeing south. In several places he actually encourages the reader to go""treasure hunting"". Calling artifacts ""treasure"", is not something a legit scholar does. ""Treasurehunting"" is also destructive.Its my opinion Robert Feather is a dangerous anti-semite."
3,Is Ahkenaten the founder of Essenism?,"This book details Mr. Feather's research into the Copper Scroll. He builds a fairly strong argument for considering the Amarna period as the background for the rise of the Essenic tendency in Judiasm. Overall, I think his case has merits. There are a few errors, such as how he gets the name of Ahkenaten out of the Greek lettering on the scroll. His conclusion that the ""g"" is a reference to Mt. Gerizim, however, is unique and helpful. He should follow up on how the other Greek letters function as section headings, rather than how the name is embedded in the sequence."
1,CAUTION: Not for XBox 360 SLIM HD,"This only works with the old style XBox 360 HDs, not the newer SLIM HDs that fit inside the XBox case. That wasn't clear to me from the product description. I sent this product back."
1,XSATA produced red-ring of death,"I strongly recommend against purchasing this product. I bought XSATA to transfer files from my old xbox to my xbox 360; after installing the XSATA, the first time I booted my 360 it had the three flashing red lights (red ring of death). My 360 no longer transmits audio or video of any kind to the TV.I have repeatedly called their help line, but no one has ever answered, and their ""automated"" support for the 360 is broken. I have emailed their support email with no response as well.I had no history of problems with my 360, and the red ring appeared BEFORE I tried transferring any files between my 360 and the computer.Simply put - this product may destroy your xbox."
4,love the LED,"I don't think I ever used it for it's initial purpose, but I keep it on my Xbox cause it's freakin cool looking! Blue LED is my favorite color, and the Blue LED that goes around this has amazing color. Not dull at all. The LED display this provides really adds alot to the xbox and makes your xbox seem like it's custom. My girlfriend's brother walked passed me in the living room, stopped dead in his tracks and turned around and said ""what's that, my xbox doesn't look like that!"" Like I said, this really adds alot to the xbox and makes your xbox stand out from everyone elses in the world. The only thing I didnt like was, even tho I said LED blue is my favorite color, it was blue. It didn't go with the theme of the xbox green. I ripped off the blue LEDs, and soldered on green LEDs to match my xbox and now it's perfect."
1,XSATA ISSUES,when i opend my xsata outta the box got it installed and what not i turned my 360 on to find that mine for som reason has green leds no i thought w/e but now i dont trust it since it cant find my hdd and i doubt it even works resolving my issues with customer support from crazygamershop as we speak i hope it works if it doesnt probably wont get another 1
1,a public service,"I don't usually write reviews, but just a public service that might help a lot of other people.Getting this product to work is a chore (although mine worked fine at the end) and removing it is impossible. You're better off with the memory unit transfer kit instead of this one.Though the memory unit doesn't have enough space for backing up videos you've downloaded off the marketplace. But using the XSATA for this particular reason is no good either cause almost all marketplace downloaded videos are digitally signed.This means, you won't be able to play them unless they are on your X360.And it's even more convenient to delete movies from your hard drive and redownload them again from marketplace when you need them than using the XSATA to backup and restore them.Hope this helps"
2,Bosch water pump,"Does not include the back part of the casting (Beck Arnley does). The one I received, several of the smaller mounting holes did not line up with those of my 2006, 3.5 liter Kia Sorento so I had to return it and buy elsewhere."
2,bad video quality and does not mantain what cover promises,"Prehistoric technology (80s) for expeditions that find only, after 2 hours of enough annoying movie, only a propeller blade.. and a really bad video quality.. maybe ants have eaten the original film ;)"
1,Don't even look at it! Even if you're a simpsons fan!,I could not believe how terrible this game was. The controlls are sloppy and the gameplay is horrible. You cant do anything. If you pick up a weapon or something you cant do anything with it. Avoid this game!
5,Perfect prep for the test!,"I used this book along with the Exam Prep & Exam Cram Network+ books and scored a 92% on the test! The tests are really good, and make sense especially the very helpfull explanations as to what was right and what was wrong. I wish Coriolis had a i-Net+ practice test book on the market right now, I could really use one!"
2,Terrible.,"This book was completely useless. Each of the four exams that come with it is really all the same exam, just with the questions in a different order. The exam on the CD-ROM contained a couple obvious errors, and didn't function properly. A waste of money. The Network+ Exam Cram study guide itself is completely seperate from this product, and was quite good. This book shouldn't bear the ""Exam Cram"" logo."
3,To be used only as a supplement to a better study guide.,"I took the exam last friday (6-22-01), and the exam was by far much much harder than the sample items presented on this book. Most of the questions were very simple, and on every set (there were 4 sets all in all) some items were repeated almost to often.Its a good thing that I bought the Network+ Study Guide from Sybex before actually using this one. Although I was able to pass the test, I would recommend that you people should find other materials and make this purely as a supplement! Best of LUCK .....!!!!"
4,Good book for final prep,Good questions.You will get alot of situation questions on the exam.This book will help you alot with those questions.
5,a must for the exam,this book is really great. there are 3 tests plus one on the cdrom. there are many questions that are actually on the exam.
2,Not very helpful,I used this book as a final review along with the Network+ Exam Preparation Book. I scored in the 90s for all the tests. On the real test almost a third of the questions had not been covered in this book. Some of the concepts asked about were either not even discussed or had very little emphasis placed on them in either of the books (I looked it up afterwards). I was lucky to pass.
2,82% Pass Mark to High for this Book,Now that the pass mark is 82% for the N+ exam this book does not provide enough realistic questions.
5,Great Signing DVD for children!,I first taught my daughter to sign when she was 6 months old. This was one of the DVDs we used to teach her (and us) and she is now almost 4 years old and still loves to watch it over and over again. Her little brother (19 months) loves it too. The movie has children teach the signs along with an adult teacher which I think holds my children's interest. The songs are catchy too. A must for those teaching sign language to their children.
3,Sign A Lot,I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old mildly autistic nephew for Christmas. He is learning how to sign as he has been slow to speak. He seems to like the DVD pretty well but there wasn't an overwhelming interest in it.
5,A 13 year old likes it too!,"I am 13 years old and I babysit for a lot of children. I first saw Sign-A-Lot at one of the houses I was babysitting at. While Sign-A-Lot is directed to a younger audience, I as a 13 year old found it enjoyable and learned a lot. Sign-A-Lot is a fun way to learn sign language. I recommend it to all the parents I babysit for and my mom and I give it as a gift to all my younger nieces and nephews."
5,"sign-a-lot, ""the big surprise!""",I had a lot of fun watching this DVD. I learned a lot of words in sign language. And it is a DVD that I can watch with my little cousin and we can both enjoy.
5,My class is crazy about this DVD!,"My preschool special education class is crazy over this DVD! Probably the best video I've ever shown them, they want to watch it over and over again. The songs teach them food signs, feelings, and actions. The kids start randomly singing and signing the songs during circle time, snack time, and even recess, and want to see the DVD again and again. I hope this company will make many more DVDs like this because I plan to buy every one of them!"
4,Not my favorit,"Ok, I love Anne Stuart, and I liked this book ok but I didn't love it. It was just a little out there for me.... but at least it had a happy ending."
3,Ok,Unlike many of her other stories this one did not immediately grip me and I ended up just skimming the book.
1,Very disappointing!,I found this book to have very few original ideas and really did not feel it was worth the money. You are better off to purchase Strategies That Work by Stephanie Harvey for ideas that are easily implemented but long lasting.
5,where am i?,"Amazing album of sonic fullness and alt.electronic bliss. Left-of-center hooks and minimal beats, and dang, what's up with these album titles? This album veers off through some portal of space & time and slips you into an electronic pop coma by the end."
1,Here's one way to save wedding money -- don't buy this book!,"To be frank, this book was a total waste of money. In all the 1000 Bargain Tips, I don't think I found ONE that I haven't already thought of, read about in a magazine or seen online.Among the wonderful tips:--Serve a less expensive meal to guests--Order fewer flowers--Buy a non-designer dress--Borrow your ring pillow from a friend--Get a photographer to cover just a few hours of the reception instead of staying the entire timeWow, thanks for the insight!How about, Save yourself $12 that could be used to buy your unity candle by NOT BUYING THIS BOOK.I stupidly bought it in conjunction with 1000 ways to make your wedding special. Can't wait to crack THAT one open."
5,"Witty, wise and nod-your-head fun","This is about as smart and witty as pop music gets these days. Think Randy Newman or John Hiatt with a fine voice and a woman's sensibility (albeit one who'd like to grow a pair). Like Hiatt at his best, Amy writes about family and relationships in a way rarely touched upon in music. If you like artists like Aimee Mann, Rosanne Cash, Caitlin Cary or Hiatt, you'll revere Rigby. She ought to be a household name.While this is a fine collection, her three solo discs are also worth tracking down."
4,"""ALL I WANT"" BEST SONG ON CD!!!","I love Amy's song, ""All I want"", it's great and I really enjoyed listening to it."
5,Great Educational Book,"I got this as a follow up to ""It's Not The Stork"". My son is 8 years old and is capable of reading this by himself. I see many reviews say this is not the kind of book you give your kid and walk away. I did just that to give him some privacy. I asked after each time he read it (or parts of it) and he proceeded to ask me questions. It does include brief descriptions of STD's and abortions. My son seemed to skip over those parts as he was not ready to understand those things. I personally think it is very important for children to have the correct information and be able to ask questions, this book will open that door to education and communication."
5,Excellent. Good for a wide range of ages.,"This book is lovely. It is gentle and kind and sweetness and light. It is direct and clear and very nonjudgemental.This book discusses body parts and differences between the sexes. It uses proper terminology at all times. It discusses How babies are made. At all times it is tactful yet very clear. The drawings are cartoons and they add to the text rather than distract or take away from the text or add too much information.It is NOT about how your body changes through puberty. It is about how your body works, looks, does it's job of growing new life.I strongly suggest this book to my friends when they are a bit freaky about talking to their children about sex and babies. THis is a good place to start, even for older children."
5,Fantastic book,"As a former health educator, I really appreciate how well done this book is. I recommend it to all my friends to use with their kids. It is VERY important to note that this book covers abortion and alternative lifestyles. Parents should read the book themselves before reading it with their kids and decide how they want to present that information. However, those pages are easy to skip if desired.While this book explains thoroughly and in great detail the reporductive process, it is not a book you should get if you are not willing to read it with your child and have an open discussion."
4,Some of the pictures seem too graphic.,"The book is good. I just felt the narrative was a little silly and drawn out at times. Also, there are a few pictures that are more detailed than I think was necessary."
4,Great Introduction,"This book is clear, concise and easy for children to understand with appropriate pictures to help answer their questions.Unfortunately, as someone who believes in the Bible, I noticed one segment that is contrary to my belief in marriage as a requirement for sexual relations.The book also makes a point of explaining homosexuality and tells children that this is another form of love. It promotes acceptance of all, which is nice, but some of these concepts parents may wish to explain in their own way or according to their personal beliefs."
2,Explicit,"This book was quite explicit. Quite a bit more than what I expected by reading its introduction or reviews. Way too advanced, I feel, for our 7-year old..."
1,"Great book... except when you get to the ""politically correct"" parts","Just a heads up for conservative parents, there is a section with a discussion about sexuality and alternative choices (like homosexuality) and abortion is mentioned as a birth control option.You need to be aware of these sections before sitting down with your child and having ""the talk."""
4,Great way to broach controversial subjects,"This book contains lots of information on body science, as well as a loving view of different lifestyles. I used it as a way to open a dialog about sensitive issues such as abortion and homosexuality.I am a Catholic mother of three daughters. I want my children to model what Jesus taught-LOVE OTHERS and DO NOT JUDGE. I feel that there are many ways to love others and many ways to create a family. We need peace and understanding in this world. I read this book with my girls and we discussed (and I even made my own notes on the pages) all of the issues and where I stand on them, as their mother and guide. We also discussed that people have different views on these personal subjects, but everyone deserves repect. Good book!"
5,Highest Recommendation,I started looking for a book like this when my 6 year old daughter was asking me questions about sex. It was recommended to me by her school librarian and it is the best I have seen. We read it together and she was fascinated. I bought 4 more copies for friends with kids.
4,A good enough parenting book,"Why it is a ""good enough"" book, not excellent? This book is good enough to provide great ideas/concepts to both me and my child to start the subject. It's not as formal and serious as majority books in the market regarding this topic, but it's good enough for me to initialize the conversation with my child. My child would learn more and easier, if he learn in a fun way.Generally I think it is a good parenting-aid book, at least for me."
4,questions children ask,I bought this book for my 8yr old nephew and his father( my brother) because he was so interested in my pregnancy this year. My brother said it answered a lot of his questions and will be very interested to see if my nephwe uses the book later in life when he wants to know more.
2,Let Down,"Delivery was prompt but I guess I was expecting something nicer than what I received but I should know that you get what you pay for. This figure has big, old feet. It's packaging is better looking than the figure. This is a gift for my nephew who is a huge Tom Brady fan. I'm not for sure I'm going to give it to him now. It's more of a toy looking figure than a collectible."
5,A real eye-opener and great read,"This book is filled with interesting but very disturbing true stories of westerners (and others) who must fight in the courtroom to protect their liberties and rights guaranteed by federal law. Although the author is an attorney, he writes for lay audiences and makes a very compelling case that government is much too big and powerful and its lawyers do not care about justice. The willingness of ordinary Americans to go to court for years and years is inspiring. All of the book is very well documented. I recommend it most highly!"
5,a true western warrior,"A thought provoking and revealing study on some of most significant and successful legal challenges to the Federal Government's ever-expanding reach into the lives and land uses of those uniquely American Westerner.Who better than William Perry Pendly, a true ""western warrior"" in every sense of the phrase, to bring us these inspiring stories of the men and women he has led and the court battles they have waged in their noble yet unsung effort to preserve true Republican ideals and the Western way of living."
4,Fun clothing,"Good ideas, simple construction techniques, nicely illustrated. Triggers creative ideas. Want to try a couple pieces myself this summer. Recommend."
1,Que decepcion!,"Ojo! No hay por que comprar este producto en espanhol - es solamente musica, lo unico que encontraras en espanhol es en menu. (Gran cosa, verdad?) Ahorra el dinero demas y compra no mas en ingles..."
2,"Too Rigid, Not Ergonomic At All","I bought this chair thinking I was going to get support and comfort. It is absolutely rigid and hard there is little comfort. The supports are solid, but not fit to the body. When they say molded, they mean hard and inflexible. The seat bottom and back design is just straight. So your butt is annoyed and your back is not supported but encased and bangs around in it's container (the chair). After the first paddle with it, I was so annoyed with it I just wanted to throw it away.I spent a good bit for this, and am going back to the seat that came with the boat. The best I can say for it is the flowers are cute and the little pocket in the back is a nice touch."
4,Universal Lessons,"With so many books on leadership, it's rare that one stands out as both comprehensive and new. I was skeptical that a book on ""women's leadership"" could effectively speak to both genders. I was surprised. While, I don't necessarily agree with all of the authors, I do appreciate the common theme that the best leaders do more listening, collaborating, and coalition-building. We can all get in that boat!"
1,"Carly, a leader???","I was actually interested in this book until I got to the 'Carly Fiorina' part. It was stated that she was successful at HP and the merger exceeded critics' expectations. As an HP (female) employee, I have lived through the Platt, Fiorina and now Hurd years. And, believe me Fiorina was the worst kind (and most HP'ers will agree with me). She ruined this company!! She was visionary alright --- only about making millions for herself!! Please do some REAL research before making any assumptions on the successes of any CEOs (especially Carly)."
2,Too difficult to get on !!!,"Purchased these boots because of the side zippers and supposed waterproof capabilities. They are great looking and might even be well made, but I really can't say for sure since I was not able to get them on and wear them. Fully unzipped, I wasn't able to open the shaft wide enough to allow me to put my feet into them. Seems that unless one has very narrow and/or extremely flexible feet and ankles, they might be very difficult to get on."
2,Too much spanking NO PLOT,"I am a fan of 50 Shades and also read Bared to You....loved them immensely. I was looking forward to this series. I had no problem with the S&M element and I thought the premise, initially, was pretty cool. The problem was the story never, ever developed. The S&M was focused on constant paddling with no progression or resolution and very little actual sex. The most important thing that disappointed me was the complete lack of plot development. The relationship between Beauty and the Prince never developed and they never really engaged with each other. The book started off with a bang and basically completely failed to deliver. I won't read the remaining 2 books."
3,I beleive this to be a hard game.,"The greatest redeeming value of this game is that it's full of mini games. There are a series of levels in this game and each level has several of its own mini-games that give rewards towards your player. The category of games differ from level. Some have Simpson Trivia, the slide puzzles, Pick the right cup, games of that nature. But the first couple of levels are easy to beat. I cannot get past the Ice Cavern. It's like they purposely made it hard by giving smaller platforms to land on and so forth."
2,Schenker please leave Varney,"Michael Schenker is hands down one of the greatest guitar players ever to walk earth. I may be way out of line and totally incorrect, but the teaming with Mike Varney and Shrapnel records in my book has been absolutely frightening. Mind you I have been a Schenker fan for many years and love and respect all of his work. Arachnophobiac has potential to be very cool, the recording is at best, terrible. The Mids are so low, you need to [turn] them to hear Schenker. The drum mix is so muffled and buried by compression. If mixed by a professional and not some intern from an audio tech school this album would possibly be excellent.Again, not bashing Michael Schenker or his engineer - for Michael is an awesome player and songwriter. Michael, Please finish the contract with Shrapnel and get back to quality-recorded music."
3,The Michael Stryper Group,"Hey look,I am a big time Schenker fan. I own every single ""solo"" release he has put out. I buy his stuff for great songwriting and great guitar playing.This CD is at least very good, and I was really excited to see that Stu Hamm played on it. It seems that no matter who plays in Schenker's lineups, it's consistently good.There is one problem with this CD though... I don't like the fact that each album is getting more like Stryper in terms of preachy ... lyrics. If I wanted a Stryper album, I'd buy it. Perhaps Mr. Schenker could warn us that the CD contains preachy whining lyrics... Maybe a big crucifix on the cover would be an accurate representation of the content of the album - or better yet - if this is what MSG's CDs are going to be like from now on, have them placed in the Gospel section so that unsuspecting MUSIC fans won't waste their hard-earned money on a sermon they don't want to hear."
3,A little better...,"You know, I'm now 42 and have been listening to Schenker since I was 15. Used to be (at least for the first ten years) I could buy one of his albums, race home absolutely certain that I was gonna love it. Those days are gone. I almost didn't buy this one in light of some of the dreck he has put out lately, but old habits die hard. I did it, and it was better than I expected. It's hard not to smile when you here the title cut. But the truth is, while there are some good licks on this album(especially Jeff Watson's) the simultaneously blistering AND melodic sounds (you know - the ones that give you goosebumps when you here them) of the UFO and early MSG era aren't here. And while I kind of like the Christian overtones (it's refreshing to hear something different), I just don't care for Logan's voice. The good news is you won't hate yourself for buying it, but you probably won't pick it up a year from now..."
5,excellent resource for us over 35 ladies!!!!,I had my first baby at 19 and am having a second now at 36 - what a difference age makes!!!! This book is very informative and answered many of the questions I had.
2,Informative but scary,"I did not particularly enjoy this book. I found it to be full of frightening ""what-if's."" I would reccomend it to anyone over 35 who is expecting their first baby as is contains a lot of info on the developing fetus etc...but I thought the overall tone was too doom-and -gloom for me."
5,Dr Shanahan is a Women's Health Hero,"I have had the opportunity and pleasure to know Dr Shanahan personally for a decade. She has devoted her life to improving women's healthcare on the borads of innumerable women's health initiatives. She does this for free because she cares. Her personal (and successful) journey through infertility to motherhood inspired her to write this wonderful book. I recommend it to anyone who wants the medical facts from an expert Ob/Gyn, with a good dose of ""Mother's love"" and understanding thrown in.Roberta Speyer, President"
4,20-20 Hindsight,"While I have not finished reading Dr. Shanahan's book in its entirety, I was most impressed with her ability to express herself with sincerety and humor. The items from her journal made the book so much more personal. I have loaned my copy to some of my co-workers and they too felt the same way about her ""personalization."" One of them read the dedication page and the tears rolled down her face. I hope to obtain further copies for friends I think would benefit from this book.Thank you, Dr. Shanahan."
1,Read this book and get paranoid,"I hid this book from my wife after 15 weeks. Each chapter covers something catastrophic that can happen to baby or mommy - a new thing to freak you out each week - how fun!Even though the chances of these things happening are extremely small, so much time is spent covering them that you cannot help but become paranoid about how many things are already wrong with your baby.Do yourself a favor: get a book like What to Expect While You're Expecting, eat healthy and see you Dr. regularly. You will learn enough about what to do, what to avoid, and what is happening in your unique pregnancy. Reading this book will just cause stress for the mommy to be and that's not good for her or the baby. I can't say it enough: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!"
1,Wrong kindle edition?,This book appears to have been updated in 2011 but the version that was delivered (kindle version) was the year 2000 original. Luckily I could return it -- I'm sure enough has changed since then. But Amazon needs to fix this issue. I'd consider repurchasing the real 2011 version if it exists.
4,you learn something new every day,"after 4 kids, I should know it all, but I've never been almost 40 before, so I bought this book. it answered my questions about the diabetes I have this time. I wish I had had the book when I was having the amnio, because my doctor really didn't answer my questions very well, and I didn't know about the option of earlier testing. I didn't get to finish reading it because my little sister ""borrowed"" it as soon as she found out she was pregnant."
4,Aramis Splash,"THIS IS A Familiar Product, i HAVE USED IT BEFORE. AND PROBABLY WILL AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. eNOUGH SAID.."
4,Stil Great,"After 50 years of use, still one of my favorites for the library, the gallery and Sunday afternoons. Such a distinctive punch, not as delicate as Grey Flannel but marvelously elegant."
5,I consider this My Scent,"This product is getting very hard to find in my area, so I was delighted to discover I coudl still buy this through Amazon. This is a great scent."
3,Not sure if it was the real stuff.,"My husband only uses Aramis and in all the years of buying at the department stores, never had a complaint. This product however does not smell as strong nor last as long. Wondering if it the real deal."
5,My man smells wonderful!,Bought this for my guy. It's his favorite and I love how it smells on him. We'll keep buying it.
3,"Ho, Hum...","This is, I take it, suppose to be a guerilla manual for finding a job via the resume. It's main advantage is the collection of unconventional advise regarding resumes and job hunting. Unfortunately, very few of his suggestions are really very practical. It's main value is a morale booster for those whose job hunt has not had much success. After all, if all else fails, you might as well try some of the methods the author suggests. I do not recommend this book, except for those who are having problems with a resume-based job search."
1,"Trite, Shallow, Banal and Essentially Worthless","On the plus side, although it was a complete waste of time, this book can be read in under an hour. On the minus side, if you ever looked for a job at some point in your life, about the only practical use for this book is to prop up a wobbly piece of furniture. It contains such ""helpful"" hints as ""dress nice for interviews"" and ""don't drink alcohol at lunch."" Wow, truly Earth-shattering! I'm surprized there wasn't an entire chapter called ""Change Your Underwear."" I can't believe there were so many positive reviews of this book. You guys must all be new grads or something."
1,wow...,"This may have good content, but its not a book! I ordered from this site and received an audiocasette!. The old ones that no cars even have a slot for anymore. Nowhere in the review does it specify that and the reviews all talk about the book... don't buy unless you want some tapes to listen to."
4,very good,"Next to using the Vault.com website, buying this book was the best thing I did for my recent job search"
3,One Good Piece of Advice,"I got one good piece of advice out of this book and it was worth what I paid for the e-book. Don't buy the hardcover! I'll share: Keep points for what you do in your job search and try to get to 5 points per day. Great motivation tool and it works! So, assign points like 1 point for company research and 2 points for sending resume and 3 points for an interview. Keep a log of what you do each day and add up the points - goal is to get to 5 each day. Has kept me on track and moving forward.The rest of the advice isn't backed with many concrete examples or success stories. He has a unique approach, but much of the advice I don't agree with and didn't make sense. I gave it 3 points because it's not all bad and there are nuggets of good info like I shared above. You can probably do much better. The e-book is the best way to go on this one if you really want it."
2,Poetry book misses mark,"Some have likened the work in this book to all that poetry should be--retelling and presenting for the reader images and tales of the grand themes in human existence. Unfortunately, I want to say to this proverbial ""Mr. Sir"" or ""Ms. Ma'am"", you missed the boat. The poetry only obliquely touches on these themes, and when it does, tells them in only a manner that an ex-patriot could love. Won't you come home, Jimmy Dean? Jimmy Dean? With these simple words one can portray more than all the stanzas in this book put together. While the language is at times beautiful and haunting, the substance could use the real work. And so I urge other readers to leave the la-la land of ""overseas"" and ground themselves in the real and now."
2,The Republican Playbook,"The author is known for his comedic writing, but I did not find this book to be that entertaining. My review has nothing to do with the political aspect of this writing. It just wasn't up to Andy's usual standards."
5,The Republican Playbook,One of the most hilaruous books I have red. It is very up to date and easy to read. The graphics and blue pen handwritten side notes are a real kick.
5,Brilliantly Funny!,The Republican Playbook is HILARIOUS! Andy Borowitz ingeniously blended the past political events with razor sharp humor; it is one brilliant political satire.You can't put a price on all the laughter you'll get out of it! It's definitely worth reading.
2,Disappointing,"Perhaps I expected too much but the book's humor seemed labored. The author's daily ""shockers"" are usually more spontaneous and on the mark."
1,Typical Left Wing Drivel disguised as bad humor,"Much like SNL has done over the last five year, which can account for their low ratings, this humor is predictable and not based in any truth. Humor needs a tinge of truth to be funny. I also have the CEO's Guide to Prison by the same author and should have learned my lesson with that book. The writing is solid, but the humor fails."
2,Not very quick.,"I'm a huge fan of PeachPit's Visual Quickstart Guides.They allow me to quickly learn how to use an app.When Flash MX 2004 came I was supprised.It is 3-4x times the size of a normal quickstart.It has almost 700 pages.It has some good info, but it not a quickstart. I'd have preferred a 150 page option. In my busy life it is just to daunting.In PeachPit's defense, I'm sure the product description said it was almost 700 pages, I assume it was quick like the others I've purchased.Thanks.om"
2,Very simple approach,"This book might be good for people that have never opened flash but for anyone that even knows a bit of flash stay away. It is a real boring read, well for me anyway. It did more of just explaining icons in the program, which is cool, but if you bought flash, you can open the help file for that.The writer doesn't seem extremely proficient in Flash which is scary to think. Flash is a complicated program, and for a book being close to 600 pages, it might get you past the toolbars.I ran through this book in about a day with it really teaching me nothing new or anything for that matter."
4,A good place to start,"Adobe and Macromedia both write excellent software but both have two things in common - the lack of being user friendly and intuitive.This book is a boon to those who are willing to put the time in to learn Flash MX 2004. The explanations are clear and the examples allow a user to actually create Flash projects rather than just reading about them.Flash, itself, is a monsterous program, and so the book cannot cover everything - Flash scripting for instance is only touched on lightly but if you are looking for a book that will give you a solid beginning, this is a good place to start."
3,Green Peace Flag,They sent the wrong color. Now I guess I have to ship it back at my cost. Wish the color had been right.
3,Flag,"Quality not bad for the price but color was a completely different shade than what appeared on line. Bought this for my husband and he is giving it to a niece because the color was too ""girly"" once he saw it in person."
4,Soft & Warm,"I no longer have cold feet. No, I'm not about to take a trip down the aisle. Soft and warm; a good buy."
3,The sock eaters.,"This slippers work well for comfort till they start to eat-up my socks. As I walk my socks end up getting lower into the slippers, have to keep pulling them up. Other thing is that they are difficult to slip on. There should be some type of elastic material that will help put on the slipper much easier. The warmed and comfort is good, keeps the cold out, I just like to put them on and keep my sock up where they belong."
5,Warm Feet,"I am a diabetic with nueropathy and my feet are kept nice and warm in these slippers. I often have to run out for a minute to take my children to school, and these work as a great alternatives to a pair of shoes for a quick trip to the store. The bottoms seem to be oil resistant to a point, unlike a previous pair I purchased from another company (those bottoms disintegrated almost immediately). Overall I am very happy with these slippers. They work for my lifestyle."
5,High quality beautiful sleepers,I bought one pair for my son and then I had to order a second pair for my husband who is not so fond of sleepers. But this pair is truly comfortable.
5,Comfy and a great value,"My feet seem to always be cold during the winter when I'm downstairs. These slippers fit well and are super plush and comfy. The rubber sole hasn't slipped on me yet, even on wet cement."
2,After 5 Mos. a hole in the heel.,"After 5 Mos. a hole in the heel. Daily indoor use, but I am not a heel dragger. I would not buy again."
4,Slippers,"I purcased this pair of siz3 13 slippers. They are seeming nice, but they are slightly shorter than size 13. I hope they may strech out in length a bit. In the past I have purchase other brands that fit very well."
3,Nice slippers but size runs very small,"I got these for my husband for Christmas in his regular shoe size 11. They looked and felt great out of the box, but when he tried to put them on he could barely get his bare feet into them. He did but they were way too tight to wear . They are not men's size 11 in US sizing. We would've exchanged them since he did like the style and materials, but there were no larger sizes available. Very disappointing."
4,Not made in the U.S.A.,"The slippers are nice and comfortable, I would feel a lot better if the slippers were made in the U.S."
4,"Nice, warm and cozy","For the price, very nice boots. They won't win you any man cards, if that matters to you, but they are warm, comfortable, and easy to slip into hands-free."

4,Dryer Lint Removal Brush and Extension Rods,The dryer lint system worked great in cleaning the dryer hose. But the brush to clean out the lint filter area and/or under a refrigirator was not threaded and could not be used. Have been unable to get a replacement from either Amazon or the manufacturer.
1,Buyer beware...very poor quality,"Normally I don't write reviews, but I felt obligated after using this product. After watching the video and reading the directions, I connected one of the 4ft rods to my drill and inserted into my dryer vent duct. After a minute, the rod snapped. Assuming the rod was defective, I used another and connected the other 2 rods. After a few minutes, the rod broke *again* and this time it was deep within the vent duct. It took several hours to fish out remaining pieces, which I promptly took back to the store. Please be aware, the quality of the rods are cheap plastic that can break very easily. I would highly recommend looking elsewhere and avoid the frustration."
4,"good set, need to read tip/warning","I have tested this set and it works very well, as long as the rods don't break or become detached inside of your dryer vent. I have a professional setup that I use to remove these kits when they become lodged in the vent by improper use or over spinning by the inexperienced user. If you have experienced such a mishap, feel free to contact me at andrew@amerovent.com I will try to help you out.Two good tips for this set:#1 don't spin it counter-clockwise#2 don't spin it too fast or for too long in one spot. rod will overheat and break off.Good Luck!"
4,Linteater performance,"Product removed buckets of lint that had built up in my vent hoses over 12 years. Two important things to know before attempting are that the drill must be in clockwise motion or the brush can come off. Also, if the hose system you're cleaning is made up of more that one hose the hoses must be firmly and securely attached or you can separate them and depending on where that happens it could be a problem."
5,"Works Great, everything included.","Worked great in my situation, every since we moved into our house almost 3 years ago the dryer would take at least 2 cycles to dry the clothes. I tried using a shop vac to clean out the vent before, but since it is over 15 feet long I did not have any noticeable improvements.I used the lint eater with shop vac attachement and removed and huge amount of lint that was in the ducting. After cleaning out with lint eater a couple of runs, I hooked up the dryer and just ran it on air mode and it blew out the lint that was knocked loose, all total I filled up a 6 gallon shop vac about 1/2 full with lint. Now dryer takes one cycle like its supposed too.Wish I would have done this years ago, lots of money wasted on electricity over a couple of years because of a clogged dryer duct."
5,Excellent product,"The Linteater was very easy to use and removed an amazing amount of lint from within the duct. I was not able to negotiate a sharp ninety degree turn, but was able to clear the remaining section of duct from the inside. Air flow has nearly doubled. And the flexible rods can also be used to fish wires through walls! Shortly after this purchase, I came across a coupon for dryer duct cleaning for around $150."
5,"Great, easy and effective!","Easy, fast and very effective. It took me about one hour and a half to clean a 16 feet long dryer lint duct full of twist and turns. When done, I ended up with a grocery bag full of old accumulated lint, and noticeable shorter time dryer cycles. The only problem I encountered, is that the vacuum attachment that came with the system does not fit my shop back, so I decided to use the dryer blower attachment instead, causing the lint to blow everywhere. I was very impressed with the workmanship of the product and the reusability. Generally speaking, a product for this purpose at that price, can only be used once due to poor design and workmanship. The system also works on gutter draining pipes, but I did not used the product for this, and expect not to have the need to do so...I highly recommend this product, having a professional do the job, could cost the same or more than the product itself."
5,LintEater System and Extension Kit,The system worked exactly as discribed and was very easy to use. It quickly cleaned out the vents 15 years of lint. The worst part was all the dust and lint blowing out on me.
5,lint eater system,worked the way the manufacturer claimed and made a difficult task alot easier and since the run needed to be cleaned was over 25 feet the extra extension rods did the job and it was not difficult to use and i was able to remove twice as much lint from the duct than i initially expected
3,"works as advertised, but no difference in dryer performance","This device worked very well, removing quantities of lint from our dryer vent. After inserting the brush, I stuck the nozzle of my shop vacuum into the opening and then cleaned the dryer vent as directed. Make sure that you use a drill with variable torque! The plastic poles that thread end-to-end and drive the rotating brush are not very strong and have no internal reinforcement (fiberglass, etc). I don't recognize the plastic, but it looks like a 3-foot long ""hot glue"" stick. Set your drill for the lowest torque that will keep the brush spinning nicely. It would be very easy to shear one of the poles and turn a half-hour chore into a half-day one.I also took the dryer apart and cleaned the lint from there. But, after all was done, the dryer worked the same as before! Oh well..."
4,This thing is fantastic,Easy to use. We have a 20 ft run that wasn't cleaned in 20 years. There is nothing more satisfying than cleaning that thing out. We vacuumed from one end and cleaned from the other. Filled an entire shop vac. How did our house not burn down. Well worth the cost and cheaper than a service.
5,Worked great and very sturdy,I ordered the linteater along with the additional extensions. My dryer vent is vertical with one slight bend (vents through the roof). I had no idea my dryer vent was so incredibly clogged about a half gallon of water had actually collected in the venting hose connected to the dryer because the moisture couldn't get through the vent pipe. The linteater did a great job of cleaning the vent pipe from the dryer all the way to the roof vent. It pulled an incredible amount of lint out of the pipe. I'm sure I've been paying big premiums for my electricity since our dryer almost always took two cycles to dry clothes; now our clothes are easily dried in one quick cycle.Using the linteater was also very easy. I was sure to use duct tape on the connections between the extension rods to ensure they didn't come apart if I mistakenly reversed the drill while they were in the pipe (I had no problems).
3,Check Outside vent,"The product worked as advertised, but I didn't have much lint in my system. I did however have a huge blockage where the vent came out of my roof. I removed that by hand, it was like paper mache so the brush didn't help much."
4,Easy to Listen to and Keeps your feet tapping,Really good CD. Has some great songs that I was surprised that haven't made it to the radio. It's fun and interesting. It won't be that 'classic' CD that you have to have but you won't feel that you wasted time or money when listening to it.
4,Out of the ordinary,"Interesting treatment of voices and instruments, it's much more than a simple R&B CD, this is further more I really recommend it."
4,Crazy....the best song ever,"As a 67 year old woman, I thought I would be turned off by the rest of the songs on this CD, but only the first one got on my last nerve. The rest I really enjoyed. But Crazy really got me going....."
5,Awesome,"Sky Shark, a game you should be buying right now, ever since i got it, I've been play Nintendo all day. Get it Today!'"
3,A Circle Of Two,"Came a little later than promised, but that could be the mail. Very good movie and the dvd was okay."
1,Don't buy this item,"The picture on this amazon.com website is NOT the item they ship to you. What I got was a nylon sling, not this metal attachment for the sling. I've requested an RMA for my purchase and have requested that Amazon change the product info on their site."
3,Long Wait - big assembly project! - but nice piece,"After it got lost during shipping - and a 3 week wait for my item - I was happy to finally have it in hand. When they say ""assembly required"" - they are not joking - so be prepared for a LOT of assembly - even the drawers come flat and have these little holes in it that you have to push many, many pins through to hold together. That being said - if you have the patience and the time - the piece is very utilitarian - nice look and useful around the house."
4,One of the best (and only) works on Petrosian,"I haven't been able to find any other books on Petrosian's chess, and in any case 'Petrosian's Best Games' does justice to the master player. Clarke handled his work on Mikhail Tal quite well, and despite the fact that Tal and Petrosian had vastly different styles, he manages to write on both with the same quite high quality.The book progresses through his career in just the right, methodical way for a subject who was known for his dedicated climb to the top, and resolute retention of the world title. The anotation is excellent, and although I can see how the notation may be slightly dense for those a little unfamiliar with works on chess, I think this book easily merits 4 stars. I would have preferred a little less focus on the very early years, but otherwise the high quality publishing would have earned it a fifth star as well."
3,OK/Descriptive notation,"Clarke's analysis is a bit superficial, and the games are all in descriptive notation (when will they stop publishing chess books with that clunky method?) The games are exceptional; it's hard to find books on Petrosian's games, but it could be better."
2,Not much going for it...,"I realize that Morand is considered one of the most brilliant French writers during the high modern period, but this is really pretty thin stuff. I don't know if Gide will ever be taken so seriously again (as he was a couple of decades ago), but his reputation will come to no harm when read alongside Morand. Oh well, there's still some Genet I haven't looked at yet"
4,Ghetto breaks :),"We all love baby Anne- shes great at what she does and as far as ghetto florida breaks go, shes the bst. But in all honesty I was a bit dissapointed in the track selection this time around. Though Im not sure thats really her fault, Florida breaks have kind of been lacking for a few years, in my own opinion.Also, I wanted to quickly state my opinion about the review before mine...to the ""club dj"" who cant say who he is...what are you doing mixing already mixed cds? And why cant you name the names of the tunes, and not call them by numbers? In any case, I do not think you are for real and next time you shoudl at least try to write a more convincing review :)But, back to baby anne...if you like this, then I recommend grabbing her bass queen in the mix cds. Both are absolute gems and she absolutely shines on both disks."
2,"Not the best, but still good","I bought this after buying her Mixed Live in Las Vegas CD and I truly feel spoiled by the Las Vegas CD. ""I'm About to Break,"" lacks the intensity that Las Vegas has right from first track all the way through the whole CD. I.A.T.B. does not really get going until about half way through the set and when it does get there it feels like it still has not quite hit that peake you would expect from mid-point of the set. For me this CD is good for backround music because it just does not make me want to move my a** like the Las Vegas set does. But it is still a good set of tunes to hear while you are already preoccupied with something else. Avoid this if you are only a casual breakbeat/techno listener. I Highly reccommend the Mixed Live in Las Vegas release to anyone remotely interested in any type of high energy dance music. This one is really only for devoted Baby Anne fans."
2,Hillman and Alexander (4e) isn't a good choice,"This out of print text is pretty bad. I am a professor of mathematics, and teaching out of this text is a drag. The organization is dubious, and the examples are shallow. I recommend Gallian's or Fraleigh's text instead."
2,Disappointed,This Crossway book on Proverbs is so completely condensed that it should not have Charles Bridges name on. I was also disappointed that the information given did not tell me that it was a condensed version. I wasted my money.
1,painful,"There are 13 buttons per drawer that you have to push in with your fingers, and it is not easy. It's causing me a lot of pain with my fingers. Plus, there are brackets you need to screw in on the corners. Also, there is a teal metal bar that lines the top of these drawers that doesn't appear in this photo. In my opinion, it's not worth the pain and effort."
5,Excellent but DENSE!!!!,"I am currently working toward a Ph.D. in Management Science and used this book for a LP course. If you can get past the matrix algebra (which isn't too terribly difficult) you will find that this book contains more practical LP information than any other resource available. However, those looking for a ""how to"" book on linear programming might want to try a more elementary text first. This book is geared toward those interested in the more advanced computational aspects of LP (e.g., revised simplex method, LU decomposition, product form of the inverse, bounded variables, etc.). The chapter on sensitivity analysis is particularly well written and thorough. But beware, this book packs more info per page than I have ever seen!!!"
2,Unnecessarily complicated,"I used this book for 6 months and got nothing out of it. Ultimately I understood all the contents in 6 hours aften follwing a similar book by Puthenpura and Fang. However, this is very useful if you have a fairly good grasp of the subject and is useful for honing the skills."
2,This book is only useful if you already know about linear programming.,"I am using this book for a linear programming course. The most flagrant problem with this book is that it is filled with typos, making reading through proofs and examples very frustrating because you're never sure what is supposed to be written. The book is also not very good at explaining concepts and leaves many steps out in the development of new ideas. If you can avoid it, do not use this book to learn linear programming."
3,studying on the book as a student,I am having OR lesson in a university of Turkey.The problem is to solve the problems of this book.And it is very awful for me trying trying but even the results are not known.
1,Poor Rendition,"This book was supposed to be printed via OCR technology in order to make it affordable. It is neither affordable nor readable. The mispellings and punctuation errors are numerous, averaging one per paragraphy."
4,A good science title!,"I heard from this title here in Mexico some time ago, but the cost of this book is EXPENSIVE, in terms of the material and size of it.Nevertheless, I was glad to see it in AMAZON, in a much lower price (including shipping to Mexico!) so I have no doubt...The science themes that are in the book are several, well explained set of themes, and also are a little cryptic for those who dont have a clue on science, but the author tries, with a good bit of success, to explain them all. I recomend this title to everyone who likes science and similar themes."
1,Wrong Language,"The book was fine, I guess. Except it was in Spanish instead of English. I'd like to return it and get the English version."
5,I WILL NEVER SEE THE WOODS THE SAME AGAIN,After reading this book I will never view the forest the same again. It shows me how to look for clues to the past at every turn. At first I was skeptical then began to see the patterns described in the woods right by our cabin. Even when I drive the clues are there. If you have any relationship to a piece of land this book will make it richer.
3,"It's OK, I suppose","The concept of reading a forested ground to understand its history is a great idea, but I don't think it was carried off as well as it could have been. I got bored after reading about half the book and never finished it. I think there were too many assumptions made, leaving open possibilities not mentioned."
4,An enjoyable book,"I enjoyed reading this book even though it is very New England oriented. But much of the observations can be applied to Ohio. (except stone fence rows)I bought this book after I received the companion book (""Forest Forensics - a field guide to reading the forested Landscape"")as a gift."
5,seeing the unseen,"I thought I knew the woods. ""Reading the Forested Landscape"" allows you to see what is in front of you, but not seen. I will never look at a woods in the same way again. Tom Wessels does a masterful job of showing you how to ""read"" the landscape. The book is a ""detective novel"" of information. I will read it again and visit the woodlands and do a bit of detective work. Great fun."
1,The price tells it all,You get what you pay for. My daughter played with this for a total of 10 minutes. The biggest problem is that there isn't a volume control. It's just loud and the earphones didn't even fit her 6 year old head (too small). It would have been a better toy without the radio also.
4,value more than prices!,I bought this textbook more than 7 years ago. But I just read a little bit!.But recently I found that maybe this book is important for my research.I still don't know why we usually use Laplace Transform to analyzed transistor network to plot frequency response. But use inverse Fourier transform to plot spectrum of the signal in frequency domain. Maybe I will find answer in this book.
2,unusual and rare symbolism to be an engineering book!!!!!!!!,"Too confusing...it does not use standard engineering symbols, like for tables, you just need a week to get use to it. For starters...I don't recommend it."
4,"Good book on practical, fourier analysis, excellent problems","This book is an old classic in fourier analysis - it emphasizes intuitive understanding and uses images a lot to convey information, e.g. the book includes a pictorial dictionary of fourier transforms, and recommends using the method of dragging a strip of paper to get a better understanding of convolutions. The problems are challenging and very interesting, e.g. one problem asks the reader to explain the differences in spectra when reconstructing a signal by linear interpolation vs. sketching a smooth graph between the sample points by hand. (there are also easier problems for to begin with, before one tackles ""engineering"" questions as the one above) Highly recommended!"
2,Good intuitive description but loaded with errors.,"This book has a nice ""intuitive"" description of the Fourier integral pair and provides matching graphical representations/examples. With that being said, the book is loaded with typos when it comes to the equations, and the notation is not a standard mathematical or engineering notation; something in between. The author obviously understands the subject better than most, and provides reasoning for most of the notation, but there are so many errors ( in critical places ) that, in many cases, you must completely toss aside the provided explanation, and rework the examples from scratch ( probably not a bad idea with any book ). Long story short, if you're pretty familiar with the standard fourier integral coursework, you may find this book useful. If you're just learning the basics, go somewhere else or you'll regret it."
5,very good,this is a good product to bye thank you the shock r very good i like tham so much i love it
4,Great addendum to his show.,"Morbid, twisted, and a lot of fun. If you don't like his comedy, you'd be a fool to buy this. Andy's a decent musician, a daring comedian, and the Anticrooner. I rate this album 4 stars rightfully, because it delivered just what I expected, and slightly better than I expected. I bought it to listen to once. I've played it four times so far. Good job, Andy."
3,Same As Premiere 5.0 Classroom in a Book,"The Classroom in a Book series is great. It's a perfect starting point for beginners and is a great stepping stone to other books that teach you advanced things, a.k.a. layered basics that you didn't think of yourself.I read Premiere 5.0 Classroom in a Book cover to cover and it is the exact same as this ""updated edition."" Everything except for adding audio/video effects, which just changed from a drop-down menu to drag-and-drop. I believe the book is well-versed and it taught me everything I need to know to use Adobe Premiere."
1,A Disappointment From Adobe,"I assumed that since this book was written by Adobe, it would be terrific. Boy was I wrong. The exercises in this book are so convoluted. They make concepts that I later found out were quite simple seem unnecessarily complex. I walked away from this book not knowing much more than I did before I read it. Whoever designed these excercises definitely doesn't use the program professionally. It's too canned. In addition, this book was very expensive. Anyone want my copy?The Visual Quickstart Guide for Premiere is 100 times more usefull than this book and half the cost."
3,Does anyone proof this stuff?,"I've been using Adobe products for about ten years, but I'm new to Premiere. I usually enjoy Adobe's Classroom in a book series, but there are a couple chapters where the instructions don't work. This is my most common complaint with technical manuals. I've been through the labs in Chapter 12 (the last chapter) three times now, and I can't get it to work the way they say it will.Are they so busy they can't do the job right? I hate how much time I've wasted trying to make sense of their examples. There must be a better book somewhere."
1,Not much information,There was very little technical information in the short film clip. If I had been able to preview it I would not have purchased it.
4,Very Pretty Dish,"I am very pleased with this sugar bowl. The lid is substantial enough to withstand long term use. The bowl is very pretty with beautiful patina on the edges. The only disappointing part about this item is the color. Mine is more of a pale robin's egg blue than a green shade. It is a pretty color, just not what I had expected."
4,Liked storyline,I have always been a fan of venom so when I read vs carnage I was intrigued I also liked the artwork for the book and found toxin to be a interesting character all in all I liked the comic(s).
3,Okay,The story was good but I was disappointed with the art it looked to me like a bad anime drawing.
3,Ignores previous continuity.,"This book is all right, but not spectacular. There were just too many goofy continuity errors for me to really be able to enjoy it. The biggest error would be Black Cat not knowing who Carnage was; she was one of the major players in the maximum carnage saga. I don't know how an author could reasonably write a carnage/venom story and not have at least looked at Carnage's biggest story arc.Also, the whole Carnage having a spawn, and Venom's reaction to it seem kind of off. I mean, Kassady's Carnage manifestation isn't really a symbiote; it's just a part of him, so there's no ""we"" when he talks. His actual symboiote was destroyed in the first carnage storyline, so I am surprised he would be even be able to spawn, let alone against his wishes.Overall, bad-story, but nice art."
1,Poorly written 90's tale in 2005,"This tale was very poorly written. Most of it was a dispute between Venom and Carnage over a the newest symbiote's survival. The verbal dispute becomes repetitive and annoying even though some of the art is very good to look at. The chapters all have anti-climatic, ""trying too hard"" endings. The character development was poorly done as well, and quite unrealistic. Also one reason why I like Marvel books is their ""realism"", their major attachment to NYC. I grew up around cops and the NYPD doesn't go home to their family in uniform [and then run around the city with no weapon screaming for help]. But I guess the writer dropped the ball on that one [a little research goes a long way].Overall the story felt like a poor left over from the 90's and was not the symbiote interaction I was hoping for. I would much rather read an actual Spidey retro story like ""Spiderman vs Venom"" or ""Torment""."
3,Wow,"I don't know what the artist was thinking when they did this but they really have a thing for pointy chins. It can be more than a bit jarring and even a little distracting. Story wise it was decent. Toxin was interesting and had some kinda funny interactions with his host. It shipped faster than I had expected it to which was awesome. It was also in good condition when it arrived. I would have rated this higher if it hadn't been for the ""Attack of the Chin's"" aspect of the comic itself. I am glad I read it thought. You should too if your a fan of either carnage or venom."
3,Battery doesn't last long!!,I have had this for a couple weeks now and the battery life is terrible..I can only use it one time and then it dies!I would not get this one again.
2,Ipod was shipped on time but died 2 weeks later,"It came in the mail really quick. Unfortunantly, it died only a couple weeks later and I have not been able to fix the problem. I didnt even use it the first week, and by the second week when I finally got all the music that was previously on it off, it just went black and hasnt turned back on since. Reseting it does not work either. The seller is quick to respond but unfortunantly does not do full refunds even if the problem is not the new owners fault. This is what to expect when buying cheaper used products online. The two stars are for how fast it was shipped and the sellers quick response"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM EGEARS,"This poorly refurbished(if it even was refurbished) ipod died within a month at around April I believe. It's been so long, I don't know for sure. I tried to get a replacement from this incompetent company. Nearly half a year later and I still didn't get a replacement.Now if it really was refurbished, one would imply it would last longer than something that was used. I've had a used ipod from a coworker for 2 years, but a refurbished ipod dies in a month? Obviously it was not refurbished at all, it's merely used and dishonestly claimed to be refurbished."
1,Not happy with product,I was not happy with product because it was scratched and did not work as described. I would ask vendor to describe product more accurately and not describe it as very good.
1,broken,_I sent it back the board was fryed. they sent me another one and it was locked and could not get into it. sent it back.Been waiting on another one that was supposed to of shipped Aug 17th have not got it YET and this is the 25th. HOW MANY STARS WOULD YOU GIVE IT?
4,Cool Product for Music...Small screen for Video,"This is my 2nd Ipod. I had the earlier for about 6 months.I really love this based on the Quality of Sound and Design.I never noticed any hardware problem. The Screen is little smaller to watch a movie, but gives crisp quality when plugged to a TV.I had only tough time loading the existing songs and videos on to it as it has be converted to it's native fomat.The good part with Ipod is we get good amount accessories in the market."
3,Whats the difference?,"I just bought the 5th generation IPOD in october for a christmas gift, hasn't even been unwraped and already out of date. What is the difference between them. Should I return it for this one?"
4,a little heavy,upgrading from a 4gb nano to the 80gb ipod video and was surpise how heavy the ipod video were compare to the nano. at 11oz it's liked carrying a can of soda with you all the time!.because of the weight I don't take the ipod video out too offen. it's just to heavy carrying it all day.
4,30 GB ipod video Black is pretty cool,"I recently received this 30GB Ipod for my birthday. I would say it's great, it has good sound quality, and it has a lot of memory space on it.I highly recommend purchasing this ipod if you want to have a lot of songs, etc on your ipod."
3,"Great Unit, LOUSY BATTERY!",This is a fantastic unit and it does all the great things mentioned on this page and in the reviews so I won't go into all of that. What I would like to warn all potential buyers is that the battery life is absolutely horrible. I've had portable cassette and CD players (w/moving parts!) play for far longer than this unit. Apple says it has 14 hours of battery life when playing music; that's a complete lie! I'm getting 2.5-3 hours and I have the screen brightness all the way down! I doubt that you could even watch a whole movie on here with the screen lit properly and if you did the battery would surely be dead soon after. This is a major flaw that needs to be addressed and has left me a bit disappointed.
5,"Ummm, duh, I should have bought one of these the first time I bought an mp3 player","What else can I say that hasn't already been said? Ipods rule! Anyone who disagrees is wrong. I've owned two different players from Apple's competitors and there were always limitations to those players. The ipod does what I want and sounds awesome. If you are on the fence about spending a little more for an ipod, consider this your push... just do it!"
5,Excellent,The product was exactly as described. Shipping was free and relatively fast (especially considering that it was free shipping)
3,Don't believe the hype,"As we all know, Apple has revolutionized data/music organization. Aside from that, the iPod is just an expensive mp3 player with easy to use controls but definetely not an ideal video player! Who can watch a movie on it's tiny screen without squinting? Not fun... I can tell you that. The generous 30gigs come with some issues as well. The drive mount is not meant to protect the drive from drops, but we all knew that. Apparently it is not suggested that you jog with it either! So, you might just need a flash player, with no moving parts that will stay true to it purpose."
5,Love this i-Pod!,"I have had this iPod for 2 weeks now, and at first the only thing we had to complain about was my Dad's software for his iPod was already on our computer, so when we downloaded my software for it, his songs were already in my iTunes.....but we fixed it. Before i had this iPod i had the iPod shuffle (1st generation) and it wouldnt store enough songs and i wanted something bigger, so me and my parents decided to split the cost for this one! I already have 234 songs on it, and ALOT of pictures! Today i am going to put videos/movies/tv shows on it! All in all I love this iPod!"
2,"I haven't been able to operate this system , where is the software ?","I bought this item with great expectations , however I still do not know how to operate this , I can not find the sftware that makes it work"
5,Everyone shld have....,"Its really cool, i don't think zune or any other product can reach upto ipod. They are far far behind"
5,Love the IPOD,"This is the best IPOD! It holds so much without being too huge. I play it in my car the most (I use the Monster ICarPlay 200) and is comes in crystal clear, better than a CD! Love the ease of use and it is not so small that I lose it! Definately a great buy and this is the best price around for it!"
1,Just Buy a Zune...,"I got this as a gift and have had nothing but problem after problem...the screen is horribly small, it scratches easily, it is limited in features, it breaks easily(trust me I know...). When i talked with the people at the mac store they told me the life expectancy of a IPOD right now is around 9 months! 9 MONTHS!??!!? For and MP3 player that costs this much?, that is Apple for you (I used to be a die hard apple fan). I recently bought a Zune as a replacement and it turned out to be A LOT better than I thought (despite what apple fan boys will say without actually owning a zune) and its software runs well on the windows side of my Mac Book Pro. Plus the new Ipods are REALLY feminine looking... they look like they are made for women only. Do yourself a favor...even if you don't get a Zune...there are so many better MP3 players out there than this paperweight."
1,The worst purchase of my life.,"Uploading songs to the iPod is a pain, you cannot place DVD movies onto the iPod with ripping assistance that takes hours... It is just a waste."
1,Why does Apple do this?,"After spending nearly $250 on an MP3 Player I must ask why Apple feels the need to nickle and dime people to buy an FM player. Creative and Sandisk both include this. However with an Ipod a $50 add on, clunky headphone is needed to get FM reception.Obviously Apple knows they could easily and inexpensively add this to their Ipods, but I suppose since Ipods are selling like hotcakes, they feel that they can slap the cost on to the consumer.I like the product overall but it does irk me that they do this, because in effect, Apple feels it can."
5,Fantabulous (fantastic/fabulous),"This is best most awesome totally radly righteous thing ever!!!!!!! The only thing they could improve on is no FM tuner. I don't know why people say the headphones aren't very good, because they rock!!!"
5,I'm convinced that the ipod is in a whole different arena,"I bought this ipod after having another brand mp3 player for a few years. The ipod is much easier to use and itunes has really ramped up their store. There are many movies, tv shows, music videos and songs to buy and they automatically sync to your ipod after they are downloaded. The only negative I've found is that if you buy a movie or tv show through itunes to sync to your ipod, you cannot save that movie to your own dvd. So you are paying $15 for a movie you can only watch on your ipod. Though I did find that you can then use cables to hook the ipod into your dvd player and watch through your tv... and with 30 gigs, there is plenty of room to keep movies and songs and videos. I'm very impressed!"
5,Perfect ipod,I was very uncertain when I purchased a refurbished ipod. But then I did some research and found that they are perfectly fine to purchased and have been fixed with brand new parts . My ipod works great and arrived very quickly from this company. Packaging was great as well. Well done!!!
1,Don't Waste Money on Refurbished.,I purchased this ipod and the first time the middle dial popped out. I returned the item and asked for it to be fixed only to receive another ipod that didn't function properly. The second ipod's battery wouldn't stay charged and the screen continued to show the apple icon when playing music. I recommend buying a brand new ipod versus refurbished anyday.
4,Good iPod,This is a good product but you get what you pay for. I bought two. One is still doing fine after about two years and the other the headphone jack lost one of its channels. I had to trade mine to my son because of this. It is worth taking the chance to save the money if you can't afford to buy refurbished from Apple. With Apple however you get the same warranty as a new one and it looks great. It is also refurbished by Apple so you know it is done right.
5,"Amazing, as expected.","I researched a lot of MP3 players before i bought this one so I know that this is the best thing out there on the market compared to the dysfunctional Zune and the other off-brands. It's everything it says it is. easy to use, has everything, plus solitaire =). Wonderful. I'm ready to see what apple comes out with next. =)"
4,I finally gave in an got one........,"Really easy to use, good sound, an much much smaller than the zune........pretty good buy.Updating a review.... Even though I liked it, I wasn't so happy with the battery life on it. It also wasn't something I want bouncing off my waist while running, so I returned it. I still think it is a good buy, but for my needs, it didn't work out."
1,Revised turns out to be broken.,"Bought this one from freund5373 as a revised working I-Pod. Unfortunately the sad face keeps showing up, after synchronising and resetting no luck what so ever. Because this was a christmas gift for my wife we where too late to return or write a review about freund5373 better know as fiend5373. Well no more revised electronics through amazon for us."
1,Not Happy Yet!,"It has been 30 days and I haven't received this product, not sure what the hold up is but still waiting."
1,never received item,"I received an email saying the item was mailed, then two days later, I received a notice the seller cancelled sale. It took 2-3 emails to the seller and amazon to find out why, which I feel is an excuse. Supposedly my post office returned. I live in a community in a city where we have never had a problem with mail. I emailed the seller right away to ask if they could review they had the correct address and try again since I had paid. No response, but I did get a refund. I am very dissappointed and will not purchase on amazon again."
1,Item didnt work at all.,The item was in non-working condition upon delivery. something was loose inside of it. In my opinion this company needs to inspect their products for functionality before sending them out.
1,...no...,"it doesn't play. it doesn't even turn on. ordering this was a waste of time. i would have rather paid for a brand new one and saved all the hassle. and i'm still waiting on a refund, a replacement, or some type of resolve."
4,Great Gadget !,"I had not been excited about an electronic product in a long, long time, but this one has me dancing, literally. I can listen to all my 60's music, hear my books, etc. There's even a daily podcast download for yoga !! Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that separating different items in different folders is rather complicated, at least for me an aging baby boomer."
2,Better hope it will go out in the first six months,"I originally bought this IPOD due to the fact that I am in the military and would like to be able to have the options of watching movies when I'm deployed, or listening to music at the gym. And it was great at first, but now it constantly freezes up, will not turn on, and if I would like to get it fixed, I am going to have to pay up to $100 dollars plus tax just to ship/diagnose it since it is older than six months but less than a year. I think that if I'm going to pay a couple hundred dollars for a product, they should at least have full warranty coverage for the first year. Oh and in case your wondering, after researching it, I have found out that my hard disk is shot and the whole IPOD needs to be replaced. So unless I decide to pay the shipping and handling fee, I have a $250 paper weight."
1,I Never Recevied My Purchase....even though i paid for it,I ordered my product and never received it. It has been almost a month. I would suggest using another seller. I email Lennox216(the person selling it) and i never got an email back. But Amazon is going to handle it.....
4,great,this is a great ipod! i use it for running and it holds plenty of songs when i run my marathons!
3,Apple 30 GB Ipod,"Little disappointed . . . got confirmation that the black was going to be shipped and was contacted by dealer that they no longer had it. Yet, they had one in white.--I said fine and they shipped.The black had little wear from its description on Amazon and the white the screen is very scratched as well as the back. I will double think next time to make sure the condition is what I had hoped for.It works fine, plays great----"
5,Sweet but Slow,Pretty awesome product. It's no where as bad as I expected it to be. It did take a little while for it to come but then again I'm not the most patient customer. I would most def. buy from them again.
3,like my white Ipod,really liked it came fast but the center button sticks and doesn't move sometimes have to really press hard and move it till it connects to where you what it to go.
1,Having problems,when received the refurbished IPOD the center wheel was loose and hard to manipulate. I am now unable to turn it off. Plan to request either a replacement or a refund.
4,Music collection in a small device,"I am satisfied with the product, my only complain to Apple is that it should provide a A/C charger with the IPod and not make the buyers spend more on its accessories. It seems that once you buy an Ipod you are forced spend equal amount if not more on necessary accessories. This pinches."
4,Apple is the best,Apple makes the best music players. The only issue I've had is that mine seems to attract scratches.
5,Just as the seller described,It was exactly as the seller described it to be. I got it for my husband to take to the gym with him and he loves it. No problems at all. Thanks so much!!
1,Didn't Work.,"I got my ipod quickly, it seemed great at first, but it was in pretty bad shape as soon as I tried to use it. It quickly started to freeze and kept needing to get restored. Now I'm not sure what to do, it won't work at all, it keeps making clicking noises, and even hooking it up to my laptop won't work. I've only had it for 2 weeks and it is totally busted. It was a real waste of money, and it was supposed to be ""like new"". Do not buy."
5,like new,"arrived very quickly, charges well, looks nice, the handwriting on the box was really nice too. no complaints at all :)"
5,Perfect transaction,"Every thing went well,product arrived on time and as described, I got this Ipod for my brother, he was so happy with it and it worked perfectly with him. thanks a lot"
3,Good,"This product was delivered as stated. It is in good condition. The only slight concern I have is for its battery life. It dies pretty quickly. Will I need to start looking for a new replacement battery soon? Otherwise, great service and product."
4,Solid iPod,"I finally joined the iPod generation and am very pleased with the item. Great deal (TuneFlex bundle) Only gripes would be the cheap earbuds and non-functioning case. Otherwise, it is a very cool item."
5,iPod from Apple,"I bought this iPod for my granddaughter, her comments after using it for a few weeks, it's awesome, enough said..."
5,Nice iPod. Fast shipping,The price is actually slightly lower than the MSRP. Best I could find. Unit is nicely finish but sure will be scratched up in no time. Had to buy a case for it.
4,Apple 30 GB iPod Rocks,I hesitantly ordered this iPod after a year of debate. My kids had previous generations of the iPod and experienced freezes and some annoying glitches so I was a little nervous. I finally took the plunge and am glad I did! I have to say that so far I have been extremely pleased with the performance. The controls are easy to use (even with the eVo iSkin I purchased for it in place) and the newly designed earbuds are comfortable as well. The only drawback I have noticed is that the sound is somewhat tinny at increased volumes. That would not be enough for me to not purchase this iPod. I LOVE IT!
5,What a great iPod for the price!!,"I am very impressed with the function of this iPod. I would highly recommend it to people who are thinking about buying a new iPod, although I would recommend the 80GB for those who love to watch and download movies through iTunes. I couldn't ask for more in a $250 iPod, although the price of the charger was kind of steep. Keep up the great work Apple!!"
3,"nice, but broke after 2 years","This was a great ipod...for 2 years. It stopped working almost 2 years to the day i bought it. I've had this experience a few times with Apple products. As much as I love them, none of them have lasted beyond 2 years.That being said, this is a nice ipod when it does work. Great sound, just enough storage to hold my entire mp3 collection, it's cute. I used it primarily to hook up to my car stereo, which plugs into the headphone jack. Plugging and unplugging it a few times everyday did wear out the headphone jack after a little more than a year, and it needed to be replaced, but I wasn't too upset about that. I worried about leaving it in my car so I would disconnect it every time I had to stop somewhere, so it did get more wear than it would from someone who left headphones plugged in all the time."
1,Don't bother,"I expected much better from an Apple product. The company does not stand behind it's products and woe betide the unsuspecting consumer who pays a lot, only to find his/her iPod broken just days after the warranty expires. Hard luck on you! Look elsewhere for a personal jukebox that is much easier to put your music in and which will last longer, and give far more value for your dollar."
4,Expectations covered,It is what I expected but it would be really good if the battery would last longer. But the rest of it... Excellent
1,Apple 30 GB iPod,I have never purchase this product or even use one so I have no idea why I am being ask to review it
5,great product as usual from Apple,Once again I am not disappointed in any aspect of the product. Everything is great.
1,I hate this annoying little thing,"I received this as a Christmas present. At first, I thought this would be nice to have. As I started to set this up, I realized why I never wanted one. First you have to download iTunes. Then you have to import all the songs you want into the library, then sync the iPod. And the ""Do Not Disconnect"" never goes away. Then trying to delete songs off the iPod takes a miracle from God. The control dial is so sensitive, the earplugs are cheap and don't stay in your ears. I hate this thing!!! Give me CDs any day."
2,Are u Kidding????,"I was looking forward to buying an ipod for myself,until my niece asked me to help her load music on hers. She had a $25 dollar gift card for music and video. The design was light weight and modern 1 star. The functions were excellant video and music at high quality 2nd star.I Think that sums up the pros.Cons- You have to PAY ( even with the gift card) to subscribe to a sight to download music. After paying $280 I was expecting a month or so of a free subscription. YOU STILL HAVE TO BUY THE MUSIC AND VIDEO. Which I puchase from Yahoo and (Walmart 88 cents)* You don't even get a nice discount for your paid subscription. At this point, I knew I would look for a media player with more options then their (monopoly-like loading options). I could not tranfer or convert music to transfer from my PC. I'M BUYING A CREATIVE ZEN OR iRIVER!"
1,Broken,"I bought this, and when it came in the mail my dog bit through the packaging and broke it. It made me really mad. Amazon wouldn't give me a new one (they said they weren't liable for my dog) so I sent them angry emails to make me feel better. It didn't work. So basically, this is a really bad product because my dog broke mine."
1,Battery Died in 12 hours,"Bought this for my son for Christmas after much research. Opened it, downloaded music. Got up next morning, it froze up, said battery very low and then got the sad face ""contact support."" Haven't decided when I get my refund to try again or do something else. It is just very frustrating to spend that kind of money and have that kind of problem. From the looks of things, I don't believe I'm alone."
2,5 th Generation IPOD 30 GB Poor to Lousy,You can not delete a song. You have to delete everything. You can not take any music from the IPOD to your computer. ITunes is very invasive. Very dissapointing product. Way over priced.
5,It's Amazing !!!!,"I've had this for a day, and I just can't stop fiddling with it. It has so many options and things to do !It's not just an iPod it's an entertainment machine !But what's better is the fact that you can get it for literally next to nothing. (Approved by the likes of BBC and Amazon)Free-Apple-iPod.co.uk(copy and paste)Just sign up (no need to enter your credit card details)And complete one offer. I would suggest STAMPS.COM, because it's a FREE TRIAL, and you won't pay a penny.(The website gets paid for every person that completes an offer - and that's how they can afford to send you your TV)Approved by BBC and The Times !Enjoy and thanks for reading !"
4,Still the head of the pack,"iPod has always been innovating to create a whole new...blahblahblah. Okay, it plays music well. Great audio quality-simple straightforward (but aging and sluggish) interface. Great screen (although its small). iTunes is great-easy to use, simple. Also, the games that are offered for download in iTunes are quite impressive. It plays music better than the Zune. Software is better than the Zune. The rest - the Zune does better (design: i prefer the iPod's minimalism, but that's subjective). Still a scratch and fingerprint magnet, still no radio, still no voice recorder, etc.Bottom line: if you want the BEST music player - go with the ipodif you want a mediocre music player with extra bells and whistles - go with the zuneif you want a video player - get a portable media center or something**UPDATE** Over one year later: still working as new. Very reliable. Very impressed. Not planning on upgrading to the newer line anytime soon"
1,RIP OFF!!!!!!!,"Apple just released the next 6th generation iPods at a press conference yesterday dropping the prices, introducing new features and expanding the memory and now on Amazon the prices of the old iPods have gone up. What is going on??? There is no way a 30GB iPod sold for $500 before yesterday (actually sold for $224.99 from amazon a month ago). Don't be a sucker buy the new iPod Classis (80GB $249 or 160GB $349) or the new iPod Touch for either $299 or $399."
1,Are these IPods designed to die after two years?,"I bought an IPOD a little over two years ago and obviously loved it: User friendly, convenient, an amazing way to store and listen to music. Two weeks ago I went to the apple store because my IPOD wasn't starting up. I was informed that a general check and repair on an IPOD is $250, so I might as well buy a new one. When I asked the repair man if it was normal to have a $249 IPOD die after two years of careful, drop-free use, he skirted the question by telling me that the internal mechanism is very delicate. So I asked around, and it turns out that I know 6 or 7 people whose IPODS died after the same amount of time. Due to an onslaught of billboards and advertisements, and the sheer power of fad, perhaps my efforts to warn customers are in vain. However, please understand that this investment is likely very short term and going to cost you again just as you're getting used to the convenience of your otherwise awesome product."
1,Not ready for Prime Time?,"Bought a 30G for my daughter's birthday. It lasted about 3 weeks before giving up the ghost. One day we just couldn't get any response at all from the unit. We went through all the reset procedures on the Ipod (excuse me, iPod) support site to no avail.Amazon came through and paid the return shipping on the dead unit and sent us a new one before receiving the old one. The new unit got here 3-4 days later and probably lasted a whole 30 minutes dying exactly the same way as the first one.These units weren't dropped or mishandled in any way; so I believe the failures are probably due poor design or quality control on Apple's part.I've had an Iriver 20G for a couple of years now. I've traveled extensively with it and no problems. So it is apparently possible to produce robust HD based units.Anyway, I feel badly for my daughter because I think she really enjoyed it while it worked but this product appears to be a triumph of marketing over quality.."
4,Nifty,"I love my 30G iPod. I currently carry in the neighborhood of 5,000 songs with me wherever I go. Rating songs and making smart playlists on iTunes really allows me to enjoy all my music in a way that would be very difficult to pull off any other way. The Pod itself is well-built, the menus are easy to navigate and the screen is nice.Why not 5 stars? There are a few things that I don't like or understand. Not only can I not transer songs/playlists from one computer (home) to another (work), I can't hook up my iPod and play them through the second computer at all. Yes, you can transfer them over like a jump drive but why do I have to go through the extra work of rating songs and making playlists when I've already spent a ton of hours doing it once? I can also only acquire songs to my library via the first computer."
4,Lives Up to it,"I bought this for my son as a birthday gift and now six months later, gotta say it seems to LIVE UP TO the hype. So far, so good. Also bought care package...just in case."
5,My 17-yr old LOVES it keeps thanking me PROFUSELY.,"Perfect IPOD. Has ALL the things and then some, that any mp player could have. Excellent product from excellent company. Worth every cent and every effort. Great price for the high quality product; delivered ASAP.VERY PLEASED."
5,Love this!,I recently bought this ipod in place of my 8GB and I couldn't be happier. It runs smoothly and efficiently. It's built like a rock! And the 30GB is also great to have.
1,Ipod nightmare,"This iPod never even worked from the day i recieved it. No matter how long i charged it for or how hard i tried to turn it on...it wouldn't. Fortunately, i was able to send it back and recieve my money back, but i never got a return for the extra $20 in shipping. Thats the only thing that made me upset!"
1,Did not start!!!!!!!!,"This was my second return from this vendor!!The first one worked well, then it stopped working and returned the ipod.When I received the replacement it would not start up??I dont understand why these vendors dont even test the product before shipping it to their customer."
4,iPod - iTunes,"I like my iPod and I like iTunes, but I really don't like them when they are around each other. I always end up needing to unplug and re-plug my iPod several times and/or restarting iTunes a few times before the two synchronize data. Overall, it doesn't deter me from enjoying the iPod, it is just a tedious frustration. The iPod itself is a solid player; I've had no problems at all once it is detached from my PC. If you are on the fence about an iPod, I say go for it, because no other player can match the amount of cool accessories and peripherals that the iPod has. To me it is worth the 3-5 minutes of annoyance of getting iTunes to play nice with the iPod."
5,video IPOD,I've had my video IPOD for a few months and I LOVE it. I use it everyday during my commute to work. I download my favorite shows that I can't watch late at night and I watch it on the train/bus to work. Often I wonder what people are thinking when I'm trying to hold back a laugh or giggle watching my Ugly Betty show or latest The Office episode.
2,not a multiformat video player,"nice apearance but...Only play one video format. have to convert almost all mi video collection just to play in the ipod. Change it for the creative zen... much better!!!it plays avi, div-x, wmv, mpg, mp4. fm radio incorporated, and voice recordingmuch better choice."
3,Its nice to have but the battery died,"I like the size of the ipod and that I can populate it with all my music but it ends there. After only about 4 months my battery stoped working correctly. I followed the recomendations from Apple about the battery. I never expected my battery to go so soon. Also it scratches easy. I bought a case but it still gets scratched up. I like it but it has been a headache. Thank God I bought a protection plan, but now I have to wait two weeks to get the Ipod back."
3,Bad battery,"Everything as advertised besides battery life, it would die every 30-40 minutes of use and I had to get the battery replaced. You should take the time to better check your products before you say that the battery is in excellent condition as you indicated on the description."
4,ipod 5.5,"Great condition, just as described. The wheel isnt flush against the ipod though, maybe this is normal. Its raised a little."
1,better get a zune...,"I owned an Ipod video, its not worth the money!its battery life is poor, it has a small screen, the click wheel might be slick but cannot be worked out while running or with gloves, the user interface is annoying and the sound quality is not that high.when you switch to another player, like the sansa or better yet - zune - you will see ad hear the difference!"
1,It locks up every other time I use it.,"I've had it for about a year. It worked fine for about 6 months-only locked up occasionly. Now it locks up every other time I use it, and I've tried all the recommended solutions. I leave it, and in about 3 hours it runs the battery to the red zone and is unlocked. I let the battery charge, and it will play. Then the next time I try it-it's locked up. I haven't used it much-maybe twice a week for a couple hours. Expensive junk for me. And I only have 4 gig of music files on it."
4,great,"if you have heard about this then it will probably everything you expect and maybe a bit more. Videos,music,audio books and more. IF YOUR NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTERS YOU WILL HAVE TROUBLE ADDING FILES! i am fairly educated with technology and had a very hard time adding anything and still am! if you aren't planning on using video and the other things that are on the ipod, do yourself a favor, buy a regular mp3, save yourself $200 or so bucks and save yourself the headache of adding songs. other then the difficulties this is a great product"
2,Problem with Playing Music,"I just bought a 30GB iPod video for just one week after having 2.5 years of hassle free ownership of an older 20GB iPod. More often than not when I start up my iPod and press ""PLAY"" it does not, in fact, play, though the PAUSE symbol changes to PLAY. I need to turn off the iPod and back on before it will play. Considering returning this unit in light"
2,"Music Yes, Movies No","I bought this product so that my 4 yr old daughter could watch videos on a plane. It seemed more sensible than a DVD player for the same $$, though the screen is small. She didn't seem to mind the scale (kids love ""baby"" things anyway) but I DID MIND when the video froze and I had to wait for the battery to die in order to get back to the menu etc.Also, I did not realize that I would have to buy my own software ($50)in order to ""rip"" my own DVD's (Avex). I was able to copy my own music CD's to the ipod with iTunes, but not movies.Am I a total scrooge not to love my cute little iPod like the rest of humanity, or just a fool for thinking that an iPod would manage videos?"
4,video ipod,"The video ipod is very nice and has a huge capacity for music, video, and pictures! It is quite simple to use and alot of fun to own!"
4,Apple 30 GB refurbished ipod,"The ipod is descent. It had hardly any scratches, it looked fairly nice. It works well, except I'm still having trouble loading videos on it. Either I'm not doing it right or the sound just doesn't work. Overall it was worth buying."
2,Apple Device,"Screen to small, Sound quality not so good but very friendly user. Too expensive for what it is. You can find better quality MP3 for less money."
4,great mp3 player,"i had a mini before, but i left in a class and never saw it again. now i have this ipod and i love it even more then the first one. it has very good screen, the color is amazing, i played a show on it and for a small screen the quality seemed to be better then my small tv! the battery life is decent, considering its a color screen and the navigation is great. sure there are other mp3 players that might be better or less expensive, but once you get an ipod you fall in love and you don't want anything else!"
5,Great Product!,"I was very satisfied with this iPod. I held off for getting one so long because of the price, but it works better than any MP3 player I ever had. It was worth the $250 because now I do not use CD's anymore. I recommend getting a power charger to plug into the wall because the power runs out fast."
3,Battery on iPos,"As a commuter with a 2-hour daily trip to and from work, I love having the iPod with me. Although I haven't investigated the Pod Casts or the other posibilities and accessories I love the sound and ease of listening to music. One of my two complaints is that I have to make sure I keep the lock button on all the time. If not, I have found that my iPod has played itself out and has lost it's entire battery power. The other is that the battery drains quickly. If I don't make sure to recharge it every evening I don't have enough battery charge left for a second day (approximately 2 hours) of round-trip commuting. Perhaps I was expecting better battery life especially since there are so many options given within the iPod. That is a major disappointment."
2,I miss my Creative,"I Bought this thing because of all the hype. I felt like it was time to upgrade after enjoying my Creative Zen Micro for almost 2 years. Well guess what... I'm going back to Creative Labs. The first thing I noticed is it doesn't sound as good as the Zen.The battery life is horrible compared to the Zen. I don't like the click wheel and I hate the I-tunes software! Creative's software is straitforward compared to the Apple's. Every time I sync the Ipod I don't know what to expect.The last time I did it, it erased all of my songs, but it kept the podcasts!I've had it with this thing, I'm going to get the Creative Vision:M 30 GB which can do more and better for the same price."
5,great gadget,"this is great,unbelievable,only problem is did'nt come with any software.Downloading is little hassel.They should make it easier even with appleweb site."
4,Nice but easily scratched,"I am completely satisfied with my iPod. It sounds good (especially if you change those horrendous stock headphones), it's easier to use than my dad's MP3 player, and the iTunes interface is second to none. I also like being able to use it as a flash drive. Useful for lugging essays and projects around (I'm currently an undergrad in college).I only have two qualms with the iPod video. First, watching video on the iPod is completely impractical since it seems to drain the battery within a few hours. Not heart-breaking since I bought it for music and not movies. Secondly, though, the faceplate for the iPod video is VERY easily scratched. It's almost rediculous how easily it can get scratched. It also got damaged from the case I bought. Still working but I'm almost embarrased to take it out of the case now. But it's something I don't mind just as long as it provides me with good quality music."
2,sticky buttons,my pause button stick sometimes to the point that i have to wait for it to die to turn it back on
4,Hangs sometime!,I like the product except for the fact that it gets stuck sometimes such that it wont play ahead which is very annoying.
1,IPod Quit Working after 3 mths!,"The IPod I purchased on June 26, 2010 quit working about a month ago. So I got about 3 mths (?) worth of usage out of it. Does that sound about right for the quality of the products that you send out?! When I received the IPod I noticed the wheel was not flush with the IPod, but it worked. After about a couple mths or so the audio quit working completely. I took it to an Apple Store and they said it was completely messed up on the inside due to wear/tear and it wasnt worth fixing. Seriously doubt the 'wear and tear' is due on my part since I only had it for a few mths."
5,adequate,"So far I havent had any problems, It has done everything I wanted it to and expected it to."
5,30GB iPod,"es una opción excelente para aquellos que quieren disfrutar del diseño, tecnología y capacidad en un dispositivo portátil de mp3, yo he comprado dos ipods en Amazon y estoy contenta con la compra!"
4,honest considering that you buy cheap,product ok.should be more specific about the defects of the exact product you are about o buy
5,The best,As always apple products seek to please and this one is no exception. Buy without hesitation!!!
3,ipod not that great?!?!?!,i would not say this is the best mp3 player around. i had this one for about a year the 5th gen ipod i got it when it came out and i was impressed at first but then the interface and itunes was so boring. Its just bland always white now if you dont care for that kind of stuff then dont worry the ipod will be fine for you. But the only thing i did not like about the new ipods was they scratch so easily i mean you pay 250 for a mp3 player you would expect it not to scratch in 48 hours but with the ipod u better buy a case which will probably run u about 30$ for a decent one but even with the case it still scratches that i found to be very annoying.So if u like the ipod get it if you dont than look around i recently sold my ipod for a zune which alot of apple fanboys will be mad at me for saying this but i love the zune its just a lot better looking and more interesting yes its bigger but at least it dosent scratch so easy .
1,Refrubished ipod,I bought this as a gift for my college-aged daughter. She told me the battery only lasts an hour or so. That is terrible! If I can't replace the battery I have to buy a new one. I'm not happy.
5,ipod,"ipod works great, however we did not receive the installation disc to put software on our PC. Fortunately I had ordered another unit from someone else and there was a disc included."
3,"AAC, MP3, WAV, WMA ,WTF?","So far not really fond of trying to get 2000 songs off our pc on to our new MAC, and ipod."
1,iPod Died 34 days after Warranty Expired!!!,"And Apple refused to fix it for me. I can understand if I did something wrong, like drop it or get it wet, but all I did was use it for music listening? $300 and now I have nothing? That just does not seem fair. But the first thing all the Apple Customer Service Rep's said was that I should have purchased the extended warranty! For spending $300, you would think you could at least get a product that would last a few years!! Thanks Steve Jobs! Make sure that stock price keeps going so you can exercise some more backdated options. Criminal----just like Martha Stewart."
2,Buyers beware,"My wife and son went in on a 30G Apple I-Pod for dad's (me) Christmas gift. I was elated, having wanted one of these forever. I'm a professional musician and the idea of being able to store my entire CD collection as well as hundreds of my own studio recordings certainly appealed to me. Well, my Christmas was ruined by getting a gift that was totally useless without I-Tunes. My computer's operating system won't run I-tunes 7 which I learned too late is the ONLY way you get anything on or off an Apple I-Pod. I understand the reason for I-Tunes and I'm sure Steven Jobs is a hero with the music industry. But it's almost like buying a PC and expecting to run it without Windows. I have hundreds of mp3 files in my computer that I wanted to be able to take with me. I was dumb enought to think I could transfer those directly into my I-Pod. No way. If you're looking to do same, the I-Pod is not for you unless you have a Mac running OSX and I-Tunes 7 installed."
4,Great Product,Don't particularly like the iTunes software. The iPod is great. Headphones are incredible.
2,Wish it worked,"I'm sure I would like this ipod if it worked, but there is something wrong with it. It is a supposed to be used and in good condition, but doesn't work properly. I have to return it."
1,Rip-off.,"Ipod shipped on time. It was listed as minor scratches to the back, but the screen was cracked, the back was dented, and it would not even turn on. Most of all, returned the item within 30 days and was not refunded my money at all, and was never given a reply. Overall horrible transaction. Would give no stars if I could."
5,"Apple 30 GB iPod video, Black (5.5 generation)",I love the ipod. I think the design is sleek and very easy to use. Each button has multiple uses. It's very fast and the sound quality is clear.It doesn't skip like how old portable cd players do. I use mine at the gym all the time now.I loaded all my music straight from my Itunes on my computer at work. It was very easy.I would recommend this iPod if you have a lot of music!
4,Great but...,This is a great iPod the screen is great and so are the movies and games. The only thing is that it comes with really crappy headphones. Maybe Apple should think about putting better headphones with the best MP3 Player out there.
3,Ipod,"Great MP3 player but with numerous drawbacks:-1. Inconsistent battery quality. Have charged it 5 times, once battery lasted 8 hours, then 4 hours and now 3 times 2 hours, sometimes even less....using sound only not video.2. Can only charge ipod via USB on computer so when computer goes into sleep mode Ipod is not charging so will probably affect its charge. This problem could easily be overcome if Apple would provide a DC charger straight from the mains...however they do not because they want you to buy one...upwards of $30.3. Frequently stalls or freezes for no reason.4. Earphones are a nightmare...always falling out especially when running or cycling...I now use ducttape!!!"
2,Can't watch videos on it?,"the ipod looks great, the sound and the equalizer SUCKKKK, i would say buy s series sony walkman instead of this, they dont have no speakers, the alarm is so freakin' lame, the calender suck, the worst thing is that i cant watch videos from itunes either, what the hell, just wasted $100 on cheap but good looking ipoid :( I tried to convert the videos but still I CAN""T!!!"
3,"ipod ..(ok Mp3 player ,nothing great about it .)",i tried other mp3 Players but bought Apple i-pod beco of the ease of use ..specially the click wheel feature and the sleek look and feel . Otherwise its ok product .As usual apple ties you in with its product. Also it doesnt provide extra accessories etc. like charger and features like recording is missing.
3,Just Good,Apple 30 GB iPod AAC/MP3 Video Player Black (5.5 Generation) is better than Apple Ipod Nano and Shuffle and it is not even expensive.I think Apple 30 GB iPod AAC/MP3 Video Player Black (5.5 Generation) worth the prize of $200.
2,Buyer Beware.,"IF YOU BUY YOUR iPod ON AMAZON, APPLE WILL NOT AUTHORIZE YOUR WARRANTY.My 11-month old iPod video broke two days ago, and when I called Apple about getting it fixed, I was told that they can't authorize warranties on iPods purchased on Amazon.File that under things I wish someone had told me a lot earlier..."
1,Refurbished/Any Warranty,"My daughter bought this refurbished item several months ago, and it's been acting up--sometimes it plays, sometimes not. We'll have to take it to an Apple store to see what the problem is, and I don't know if any warranty is applicable. Have to check with Amazon."
4,Engineers need to work on the battery!,"I have been using the 30gb iPod Video for several weeks now.Everything is awesome but the battery. that is why I gave 4 stars. By the time, you need to convert your video's format to be able to watch them. And it takes forever. While you are watching a movie, the battery is playing 2.5 hours at most. And while you are listening to music, it is 10 hours at most.Even though I am pleased with other things, the battery makes me disappointed."
1,If you Buy it to Fly with It - Just Say NO,"Little known fact: Tech specs say the environmental limitations are 10,000 feet altitude. Good luck finding that nugget of information before buying since it's buried at the end of the tech specs sheet. And, what reasonable person would think that the 10,000 foot altitude limitation applies to the pressurized cabin of a commercial airplane?Apple just told me by phone that ""some people are just lucky"" but most iPODs (new generation) freeze up when you're in a commercial airplane. I've had mine freeze on regional jets, Boeing 7X7's, MD-88's. . .while people around me are not having the same problem. Apple said their Tier 2 support rep had his freeze up on a plane too (that's supposed to make me feel better?) But, Apple says ""nothing we can do about it"". Oh and by the way do you want to buy an extended service contract. I smell CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT on this one."
1,Refurbished or Broken?,"I bought the 30 GB iPod in June and despite some small glitches it worked well for the most part. However, by December the iPod no longer functioned anymore. When you pay $100+ for something, you expect it to last longer than 6 months. Very disappointing"
5,"Intuitive, easy to use...","just what you would expect from Apple. It worked right out of the box. I use itunes on a PC so there was a good connection there. I store most of my music on my laptop and space is getting limited. I would love to add music to my ipod WITHOUT putting it on my laptop, but I couldn't figure out how to do this. The ipod syncs with the computer - whatever is on the computer mirrors the ipod and vice versa. But this is the only drawback I found with the unit."
4,Made more fun with downloads...,"The iPod video is a great device. I bought it because i killed my mini and i wanted the video capability. It a nuisance that it doesn't come with a charger, but i had the old mini one so...i like the device overall, it's just frustrating that you have to download 3rd party things to put DVDs you already own on it, but it's not so bad. the battery life is decent and i charge mine every other day. i do use it every day so it's to be expected. The back is easy to scratch so that's the only major complaint"
5,Vietnam Air Losses,Book is a must have for any aircrew member who flew in S.E.A. Lists losses by dates and aircrew names. Not a dry treatise but with enough of a story for even the non-flyer who is interested in aviation history. Introduced to the book by a gentleman who has visted Vietnam looking for the remains of a lost F-111 crew member.
3,"""Future Perfect"" is better","I am a HUGE fan of Dara (i've seen him spin live regularly all over NYC, even his obscure Techno gig!). However, on ""Further"" I was a bit disappointed, as i was expecting a smashing followup to ""Future Perfect"", an album chock-full of hard-hitting jungle that was so driving, rolling, dark, soiled, and heavy that it thickened the very air you breathe.""Further"", on the other hand, is a bit lighter and sweeter - less of a heavyweight. And it's less powerful. I would say it's got hints of a classic drum 'n bass vibe as opposed to true jungle (Sorry to classify but i had to describe it for u folks!).I prefer Dara's live sets and his past albums--but this one is no dog either--I still like it and listen to it. If you're comparing Dara to Dara, sure this one isn't a 5 star. But if you're comparing Dara to anyone else---Dara wins every time. (oh, maybe Dieselboy would give him some hard competition, but Dara has less of an ego.)"
4,great new author,"I very much enjoyed this book. I pocked it up in a hurry while in the UK & read it fast, then had to reread to fully grasp all the clues the author gives. She develops very likeable characters in a nice Dublin setting, but makes them with unique difficulties - which is what made this book special. She made me think about what it would be like to live in a different person's shoes & to be more aware of other people's issues - plus it was a great book!"
2,Women's adventure novel trying to be more,"With a bit more research, this book could have been a political thriller; with a bit less, it could have been a romance novel. As it is, it has a mostly-implausible plot which needs far too much coincidence to save the day. The villans are given some depth, which I appreciate, but the main characters are so good and clever (and lucky) that they are not terribly interesting. The political and religious commentary was heavy-handed.This book worked for me as a sick-day read (from the library), but overall I was unhappy with it."
4,Smart Character,"Yes, I too found some of the story to be ""over the top,"" but I kept reading because I really enjoyed the main character. I loved the fact that she was always intelligent, which made me really want her to succeed!"
5,As advertised.,I've already used these several times. Great so far. The way that they're piled into the case is not that great. Makes them kind of hard to get in and out. Not a big deal for as much as I use them.
4,Git the job done!,"Like the case, not to bad getting the bits out and back in. They have worked fine so far and time will tell the tale as to how long they will stay sharp and function well. I have no reason to believe they won't continue to perform well."
3,Technical,"This is a technical review of the subject, probably more suited to scholars than to the casual dreamer. But it has one good chapter on ""how to"" - it actually did work for me once, but I think it takes consistent practice."
4,Interesting book,"This is a small (just over 70 pages) textbook like book that guides the reader through exercises into learning lucid dreaming. It comes with a cd with some more exercises and techniques. It's all very interesting in theory, but I'm not sure how many average folks will be able to do this. I know that I've tried, following the exercises, and I still can't do it. But maybe that's just me. :) If you're interested in the subject, it's a quick easy to read book that will offer some good ideas to get started."
3,You may wake up in a dream,"The book explains lucid dreaming and why you may want to learn how to become conscious within your dreams. It includes a CD that uses suggestion to help you remember to wake up in a dream, and remember the experience. The CD session worked for me once. I think it will work again. Give it a try."
1,Don't Buy This Book By the Original,"I bought this book not realizing it was just a condensed version of the author's book Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming. There is nothing new here except a CD you don't need. If you are new to ludid dreaming you want to stick to Laberge's previous work. If you have already read that, you won't need to spend your money on this. It's like the cliffnotes version with pretty packaging and a CD thrown in to make it sound worth the money. It's simply not."
4,"Difficult, but it can happen!","I think that it is certainly possible to be 'lucid' during the dream state, but it is hard work getting there. I did not use the disc provided (cool though), and I plan to explore this more in the future."
2,Meh,"This book/cd somehow managed to make me less curious about lucid dreaming as I used it. I was hoping this wouldn't be too goofy, because lucid dreaming really is a fascinating subject. But after a spending some time with the book and cd, I just didn't want to return to it, which is never a good sign for a product."
5,Dream on,"This is is the bible of Dream books. I haven't been able to catch any of my dreams and was growing frustrated with the whole process. Then I bought this book and I wouldn't say it was a magic bullet. But when I started to practice the principles of the book, I now can honestly say I can recall my dreams 95% of the time. This book in combination with the lucid dream supplements book I go lucid at least 6 times per month. I would say that is a complete turn around."
3,"Get Laberge's ""Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming"" instea","A good book but try ""Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming"" from the same author. Much more comprehensive written after this book."
4,"An Excellent ""Concise"" Lucid Dreaming Guide","This book is indeed a newer version of the original, and is concise, as the title suggests. If you are new to the subject, this book is a great starter. You will be able to get through it quickly and understand the fundamentals. The CD is also a nice touch as people new to Lucid Dream may not be familiar with some of the techniques. Others have pointed out that the original work is more detailed, and indeed it is. If you enjoy reading and are fascinated by Lucid Dreaming, then I would encourage you to pick that one up either in place of this or afterwards. I think this book is just the right size and depth to inform readers about the subject without boring them with tons of details they may not find interesting anyway. Yes, I agree with others, if you want more details and background information about Lucid Dreaming, you need to pick up his original."
3,Not everything I hoped for,"This is not the pick-up-and-play whip-thrashing game I hoped for. The fact that each enemy needs to be hit 2-8 times makes it really hard when enemies are coming from both directions. There are also a lot of dead ends that make things confusing. (There are no in-game maps, either.) It has good graphics for being an earlier NES game. The music is also good. Another positive aspect is that there are many terrains and areas to explore. Overall, the game is just pretty good."
2,Great Dust Jacket !,"The dust jacket is beautiful, too bad the rest of the book doesn't follow through. Most of the photos are boring, and most are not typical examples for the type of jewelry described. The text is sketchy, trying to cover too much diverse information in too few sentences."
5,the rocketeer,"the rocketeer for the nintendo is alot of fun to play it is not too much based on the movie you get to fly with your rocket, shoot & punch bad guys the game has 6 levels you get a password to continue where you left off"
4,request for help,I would like to buy this book and others related to it as I am reading MSc Agriculture at University and I am doing my thesis on pesticides residues. Could you possibly help by supplying addresses to buy mobile pesticide test kits to conduct tests on fields directly?
5,great for everyday kitchen use,"I have used these knives daily for about a year now and have had zero problems (except for slicing my finger on a knife blade facing up in a sink full of soapy water). I use the Santoku knife almost daily, it cuts through veggies like butter. The other 2 large knives are equally as useful. The paring knife is sturdier than others I have owned and I use the serrated knife for slicing homemade bread. The steak knives are used most often at the table, they easily cut all meats. I also really like having the shears readily available instead of having to dig through drawers looking for a pair. The only thing I have not used is the sharpener so I cannot comment on that.I am by no means a professional chef, in which case I would have probably gone with Henckels or Wustof brand . This KitchenAid set is a good, solid value and used daily in my kitchen."
4,Excelente producto lo recomiendo 100% (OJO Tijera calidad 60%),"- Excelente producto lo recomiendo 100%, relacion precio valor muy bueno, la tijera no es tan buena pero si hace su funcion.- Excellent product I recommend 100%, very good price value, the scissors is not so good but if its function."
1,Dull and dangerous,"Received this kitchenaid knive set as gift, the blades are so thin they bend trying to cut a apple, did I mention TRYING to cut, tried to cut vegtables for a salad, the knife got stuck in the middle, can't believe kitchenaid would sell such an inferior product, they better stick to their expensive mixers."
4,"Relevant, but repetitive","The author has a very good point, and makes a serious and deep analysis. But she is too repetitive, she praises her own book too often, she points at her sources (Halliday and Vygostky) virtually in every chapter, which in the end turns out to be rather obnoxious."
4,pretty good,"everything is ok about this book and there is only few drawing in the book, which help grasp the main idea."
4,off the heazy fo sheezy,"the mix of songs was so unique it made me want to get up and dance!!!!i used it at my last pool party and every one was ""completly with thier knickers upside"" just some brity humer"
5,What a lovely addition to the front door!,"As was stated in other reviews concerning this Fleur D' Lis Door Knocker, this is a relatively heavy duty decorative, as well as functional, piece. The primary reason I purchased it was so I could safely and attractively attach a Christmas wreath to my front door. With the help of a few strands of golden floral ribbon, mission accomplished--and beautifully done, I might add!!! Even when going solo, the brass door knocker adds an attractive detail to our front door. It came very well packaged with complete directions and hardware. Love it!"
4,Door Knocker,This is a huge door knocker so I hope you have a huge door. It is heavy and looks very nice and well made. I would recommend it. It is easy to install.
3,Not quite what I expected!,"I thought I was ordering a new book at the price of $38....but instead got a used book whose original sale price on the back of the paperback book was $12.95. I guess since Andy Griffith passed away, the book must be worth more. I most likely would have returned the book if it wasn't for my son needing it for a class ""Penny Arcade"" project."
2,No Photographs,"I was disappointed to find that this Bio didn't contain one single 'photograph' of any kind (only crudely hand drawn illustrations). Also, the copy I purchased from another seller was advertised as being a 'Signed' copy. Unfortunately it wasn't Andy Griffith's signature, but that of the guy who wrote it. I mention this only to warn others who may be hoping for a bio that contains photos, and to also be cautious as to 'who' the person is that actually 'autographed' the book, if it's being sold as such."
1,Refill the activated carbon by yourself & save $$$,I just bought a Eurocave Perofrmance V183 and noticed dealer recommend to change the carbon filter every year.As one reviewer (J Burke) pointed out the activated carbon can be refill by yourself easily.My additional info here is you can buy the Marineland Black Diamond Carbon Media Activated (440ml = 14.88 US fluid ounces) from Linen & Thing for under $5.Why let dealer rif you off like this? Just take care the plastic cover and you are go to go.
1,The cost on this item is OUTRAGEOUS,"It is a charcoal filter! I think I am going to talk to a buddy of mine who has manufacturing done in China. The cost of this thing is what $1 (probably 25 cents before overhead, shipping etc.)The only thing more OUTRAGEOUS is the shipping. They charge you $9.95 and it takes over a week to get to you. How do they justify the shipping???? They put a filter that is the size of large Champagne cork in a 6""x6""x6"" box... What a joke!Buy it if you have to...I did because mine cracked and I could not REFILL it. Yes that is right save yourself $39.99 and refill it. You will see how easy (cheap manufacturing) it is. Take a cardboard cutter and cut the top off; dump out the charcoal and discard the paper; buy some activated charcoal(pet stores or aquarium supplies); put the charcoal with the coffee filter (it replaces the discarded paper) back in the plastic container and glue or tape the top back on."
1,"Poor value filters, extra poor service from Wine Enthusiast","I am just going to set aside the fact that these are a terrible ripoff in the first place and focus on the additional ripoff that is wine enthusiast service & shipping. I was charged roughly 15% of my order price for shipping and handling, and the best they could muster was a padded envelope and UPS ground. In said envelope, the filters were packaged in simple plastic bags (very thin and clearly not airtight), and half of them were torn open! What good is buying a 4 pack of these (i.e. a 4 year supply) if they aren't properly sealed!2 stars for the product (Can't blame Eurocave for wanting a little extra revenue I guess)0 stars for Wine Enthusiast packaging and shipping"
1,Unfortunate neccessity,"I'm pretty dissapointed. This is my second filter purchase. $40 for a neccessary accessory that you can't get anywhere else. Additionally, they charge $10 for shipping which is absolutely preposterous! At least try and make the consumer feel better by charging $45 for the filter and $5 for shipping. I just hope this is ""made in America"" but I wouldn't go to Vegas on it..."
3,parakeet bites,"I thought they would be just like La Faebers Nutriberries but they aren't. My lovebirds will not eat them, I have to crush them up and put in with their seed."
2,I can't get into it,"I heard a lot of hype around this book, but it's hard for me to say anything positive when I am not sucked into it at the beginnning. It's very dry, at least at the beginning. I've had it for months now and have made many attempts at reading it and pushing past the first chapter, and just can't. Reading this is like going to the dentist. I really feel like I should read it and don't want to anymore. Sad, because I began the book really excited for the information supposedly contained within. Oh well. Maybe I'll be in a different place later on. And perhaps a fellow business owner and coach will find value in borrowing it."
5,Wonderful gift for our grandson.,We bought this for our 3 yr old grandson and he absolutely loved it. He started playing with it right away and was so excited to be like his daddy and papaw. Thank you for making that little boy's day. Deborah
4,Good Book,"I thought this was a good book. Until I got to the ending. I thought it was a dissapointing ending! If I could rewrite this book, I would change the ending so it's more exciting. The characters are cool. It's about a boy who wants to find his dad who work's in Candlestick Park (now 3com park) Or so he thinks. On his trip from Seattle to California, he runs into all kinds of obstacles. He has to find food, money, and his cat foxy, who runs away in a place that he's never been to before. I loved the book! I reccomend it to anyone who likes Baseball or if you've ever run away!"
5,"Beautiful, Hypnotic, and Authentic","Pure and authentic chanting by Tibetan nuns of ChuchikjallNunnery in Karsha, Zanskar. It is a live recording made insidea one-thousand-year-old temple dedicated to Avalokitesvara.The beautiful and hypnotic voices bring one into a state ofpeaceful upliftment. The occasional sounds of coughing, peoplewalking, etc., actually enhances the listening experience, asone feels like being right there in the temple with the nuns.Anyone interested in Tibetan Buddhism and especially prayerchants by nuns, will enjoy this CD. As there are so fewrecordings by Tibetans nuns (compared to monks), I found itespecially a treat to discover this CD. Interestingly though,on one track #9, there are also male voices (the first 6 minutes,than it changes to all female for the rest of the chant). Thisgives a wonderful opportunity to experience the difference ofsound and harmonies between nuns and monks."
4,FABULOUS PRODUCT!!!!,"my son started playing on the computer when he was about 1 1/2 - doodling in the paint program. i bought him this learning game to get him to do something a little more challenging on the computer and he LOVED it!! 2 years later, he still plays it often. it has taught him about matching and counting, also spelling and rhyming words. i am very impressed! i would recommend this product to anyone who has a toddler or preschooler who is interested in playing on the computer - it really is an excellent learning tool.also, the dvd was a great bonus. it teaches the sounds of each letter in the alphabet. my son learned all those sounds almost overnite!!! it makes teaching children basic phonics almost effortless.this was a great investment and i highly recommend it. the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because the intro with Steve did not have a good quality picture. other than that - the actual games and and dvd were excellent!"
3,Great potential but falls short.,"You know you're in trouble when a two year old complains about the graphics. Why does Steve look funny??? Steve is barely watchable. He was inserted into the program with terrible resolution and many visible horizontal lines. I would be embarrassed to sell this product if it were my company. The programs are on 3 disks and only load from the disks, so if you have a noisy cd-rom/Dvd-rom, the noise is not condusive to learning. The box was also missing the page of stickers. This product has great potential but falls short on many different levels. It will be returned. A much better solution, albeit smaller in scope, is the website Starfall.com."
2,"Classic Mac, not Mac OS X","Unfortunately, this application includes only a Mac OS 9 (not the Mac OS X as advertised) version. I cannot review the cds in general, as I cannot run them. Why did they re-publish the 1998 software in 2006, again in Mac OS 9? Frustrating!"
1,So let down with this purchase,"Perhaps I should have read more about what I was buying, but when I put this disc in and punched in #8. All I wanted to hear was Paul singing Let It Be..... not some bad piano version of the song. Save your cash and get the real deal. Just so sick about this."
1,bullspit.,I thought I was ordering actual Beatles music not lame muzac. If I could give negative stars I would. It's absolutely dreadful.
5,"Symphony Music, very relaxing.",Would recommend the The Beatles' Greatest Hits to all that enjoy a symphony version of the Beatles music and like to sit back and relax.
5,Fantastic kit!,"What a great item. I admit is was a little nervous at first, using this on my 1937 Gibson L-5 but I tell you, it worked so great that people thought I had the guitar's finish restored! I highly recommend it!"
3,Stand 'em up,"It's hard to rate this product as I've only used the fret oil so far - which seems to be fine. One caution is that once you open the oil you need to keep the bottle upright. I kept it in the plastic packaging laying down in a drawer and some oil leaked out, but stayed in the plastic but now everything is oily."
5,Excellent product,"I've used these expanding files for my income taxes for years. I run a small rental business (about a dozen rental homes) and find this type of file exactly what I need to retain and store all the invoices and records during the year that I need at tax time and it also provides room for my final copy of my completed taxes. I can mark the completed records for each year and then store them securely for the required three years before disposing of them, being comfortable that, in case of an IRS audit, I've got all my records well preserved and ready any time I might need them. These expanding files are durable and convenient to keep next to my computer for ease of use. I find ordering them through Amazon more convenient that shopping at the local stores and buying this file when I order my tax software for the new year, I can usually get free shipping and no local sales tax. What a deal!!"
5,Annual necessity,"Been using these as way to file paid bills. Eliminates paper clutter, makes end of year tax prep easier and then just close the flap to store for the requisite tax doc requirements."
5,As advertised,"I've tried several storage options for important papers. This, Letter sized encloable files that fit into file cabinets themselves are perfect. At the bottom of each slot it does not open to the other file slots so coins (not that you should) would not move between dividers.Sturdy"
5,Great condition,Book in great condition. Speedy delivery. My son enjoyed reading this book and using it as a resource for his black history month project.
1,"Without a doubt, the worst language book ever written","The title says it all. I don't know what to add. Long, turgid narratives, exercises that either use or require words that are not defined or glossed, obscure usages that are nowhere explained, and a vocabulary that was out of date years before the cold war ended. Burn your copy, if you haven't already, and let Yale University press know that the 21st century is here."
2,Warning for Mac users!!,"The ""system requirements"" stated are not accurate. The ""Where in the USA"" game is not Mac compatible. This is clearly labelled on the bottom of the box--although the front says Mac compatible.So a Mac user ends up getting a 12-year-old, 25-minute cartoon on the DVD, and only a one-disk game (""Where in the World...""). Given that disk is available for $9.99, this seems a poor value."
2,Only one disc of the three was worth the price,Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego is great. The other two discs kinda sucked.
1,Something's Gotta Give?,"I was disappointed in this book for all the reasons mentioned by Ms. Janis. All of her comments ring true, everyday. I too remember articles about losing at tennis or ""50 ways to make him happy"" published in magazines of my youth. I also remember being told that if I wanted to find a man, I had to be less-smart and ditch my glasses. Well here I am, new to the 50 Club, still wearing glasses and smarter than ever! If my only chance for finding romance with a man who may have ED, looks as bad as Jack Nicholson did in ""Something's Gotta Give"" and is hooked on Viagra - I'll stay home and watch old movies on TCM. In short, why should I sacrifice who I am and bother with the face-lifts, new teeth and other false-hoods that society still fosters when all men over 50 want is a younger woman who will boost their image and ego. Amen!"
4,Takes skill,"This was my favorite Konami game next to the Contra & Gradius series. It takes trial & error & patience for sure. When I finished it, I felt like I accomplished something. Not sure I ever one man solved it like Contra & Gradius but I got pretty proficient at at least solving it."
3,one of those games you forget about through the years,"But that's why I'm reviewing it, to make you remember it!It's an incredibly hard game. I only made it to the second stage. You are a guy with a knife and you walk to your right stabbing the people who get close to you, but it's hard because a lot of people come at you. In the first level you get a nice moody, and extremely catchy melody while you do this. What a hard game, like many NES games. I better not make this review any longer, since I doubt anyone's gonna read it.Final word, buy this game if you want a challenge. It's a fine game really."
5,Thicker than Water,"Melissa Gilbert and Lindsey Wagner, two of my favorite actors. Good movie, about strong wills, compassion and falling in love. This Hallmark movie is worth watching. Oh, and if you're a horse lover, you won't be sorry."
2,"Too much Rebecca Cole, not enough plants!","Lots of little anecdotes about Rebecca Cole, but as an inspiration for container gardening, this book is a bomb. If you like cute, this might be your cup of tea, but if you want to create a garden that's something special, this book won't help. Lots of marigolds and petunias in cast-off containers, but nothing new or noteworthy in the plant department. Try Gardening without a Garden by Gay Search or 50 Recipes for Container Gardens by Richard Bird."
5,Gardening Made Easy--and Fun!,"With two semi-black thumbs and not much of a penchant for backbreaking work in the garden, I was hesitant to try my hand once again at container gardening--even if it would be for one last time. But POTTED GARDENS opened up a whole new world of gardening to me! Rebecca Cole finds unique and often humorous containers everywhere she goes--and now so do I! I see containers in old coffee pots, and buckets, and boxes; in wooden shoes and tin watering cans. You simply need to open your eyes to Ms Cole's vision of what container, terrace, patio, and potted gardens were meant to be. I recommend this book to weekend and serious gardeners alike."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I bought this book when I decided to start a container garden on my deck. I returned it the moment I got it. It just didn't have what I was looking for. Although it has some stuff that is pretty to look at it didn't provide the instruction that I wanted and needed. I wasn't impressed in the least. I found a book that outshines this one in every way. It's David Joyce's Complete Container Garden. A huge book with wonderful ideas and photographs. The best part is that it gives step by step instructions on how to duplicate A LOT of the arrangements. I am very proud of my new deck and it is because of that book. I learned a lot. It has all of the info a beginner would need yet it is interesting enough for someone who has gardened forever. Potted Gardens, by Rebecca Cole can't compare."
3,gay rights from a global perspective,"This anthology is similar to many books on gay rights from an international perspective. I found it particularly useful for its article on the founding of a gay rights group in Bolivia. Those interested in international human rights may find this a useful text. Development studies scholars may like it as well. There is better stuff out there, but this is a pretty good book."
4,Amazing Album,"This is a great album. I was first introduced to post-rock through Explosions in the Sky (though both bands reject this label) and was impressed with their work. This album rivals anything that Explosions has put out. It has a slightly warmer feel than Explosions--in that the riffs have a slightly more upbeat quality. Young Mountain also holds a solid melody throughout each song that creates a theme within the song without getting lost too much in the jamming-out chaos that is prevalent in some post-rock (although this album does have some great jam sessions in it as well!) The melody does become a little repetitive in some songs. My friend thinks it's too repetitive, but I don't mind. This is a must-have-album if you are at all remotely interested in post-rock music. And if you are new to the post-rock scene this is a good album to wet your feet with."
4,Could be sheer brilliance.,"There's something trying to get out here, but something about the climaxes of these songs aren't...powerful. Their crescendos are pulled off quite nicely, but what these guys are trying to do with the peak point of their songs isn't quite working. The climaxes are lacking melody, but there are some truly beautiful guitar riffs during the crescendos.With some more work, this could be absolutely brilliant. TWDY just has to work on their execution and finding a sound that truly defines them.4/5 stars."
3,Start climbing,"Predictable but pretty all the same, the debut EP will rest comfortably in any (budding) post-rock enthusiast's collection."
1,No.,"This album is garbage. It sounds like a group of high school kids getting together after school and ""jamming."" I'm not trying to attack these guys personally, but they just sound like they need work, plain and simple. Save your money."
2,horrible,doesnt filter the water just dont nuy it its not good and you will be disapointed i was also i so like the i forgot what its called but it works as a bubble stone thingy rjkvf rkejv jkrewv jkreb hreb krw
3,Not really one of her best...,"I don't believe in love at first sight so this book didn't actually blew me away. They start off fighting and hating each other. Then all of a sudden they're inlove. The author did not give enough details of how they actually fell in love. Overall, the story was mediocre. Not too boring and not too exciting."
4,very nice book,"Good book, many different plants, but pictures could be larger. Good book for the price."
2,Hmmmmm - ok I guess,"Not my favourite book of its kind on the market . some photos leave a lot to be desired in particular. On the otherhand a reasonable, brief, compendium of the usual tropical plants.Sorry I don't think this is special or a ""must have"""
4,VERY INFORMATIVE,"I was searching for a book like this one. I'm originally from the Washington, D.C. metro area, retired, and moved to FL. I have acquired several tropical plants and the information in this book gave me tips to keep my tropical plants thriving."
3,Rushing to an ending.,From the title you guess the ending. However when you get there it is quite rushed and unsatisfactory. The doctor and his trademark clothes can be seen in this sleepy village and UNIT plods on in its never ending fight for....... I miss a bit of character development and all within seem shallow and thin compared to other books about the doctor; 3rd or 4th. But then it's the perfect book for a rainy Saturday afternoon. Jelly Baby anyone?
5,Best pencil ever!,"My son says the following about these pencils he researched and bought on Amazon:This pencil is unusually comfortable, very easy to use and refil. Often, because i'm left handed, the lead can smudge but here it never does. The eraser is excellent.Good for writing long essays, the lead doesn't break and writes really smoothly.I'm going to buy more of them!They will become my lucky charm for tests.Edited to add - they do go through lead fast, buy refils. And he needed to get refils for the erasers as well. But he is still very happy with them."
4,Very nice!,"These are very comfortable to write with if you like a thicker barrel on your mechanical pencils. We bought our first pack 3 months ago, and they are all holding up well. My only complaint is that you don't know what they will look like. My first batch looked like the picture, except it was an assortment of colors. I ordered more because I liked them so much, and the next batch had a different look and texture. But they still are good to work with."
5,great pencils!,"I prefer 0.5mm lead, but bought these pencils because they are comfortable in the hand, easy to use, and my husband prefers the 0.7mm lead."
1,Lasted a year and now its broken.,Purchased Oct 27 2008. Here we are November 3rd 2009 and its broke. That pretty much says it all.
1,Dodge owes a lot a people a lot of money,"I have had to replace this part several times. If you go on-line, you will see that I am not alone. It's an annual replacement. I'm not bagging on Amazon. You are my friend. Dodge wanted to charge me over $500.00 to fix this. Amazon was about $50. and I did it myself. I feel that Dodge should do a recall and start refunding money.Have a nice day."
3,Decent but wish it moved faster,"It works, but I wish it pushed the window up 1-2 seconds faster. The slow speed is definitely noticeable :("
4,Better than original,"Since I have been through three window regulators for my Dakota, two from the manufacturer and one generic replacement, I decided to try the Dorman.So far it has worked great. One reviewer has mentioned that it is a bit slower to power the window but it is not that noticeable.Installation was easy, they do include a template if you had to drill holes but all holes matched perfectly. This was the second time replacing the regulator myself so it was an easy twenty minute job.The hardest part was that I forgot to put the lever for the door opener back in place and ended up having to crawl out the other side of the car to open the door.Definitely recommend this product over the other one that I purchased and broke within a month."
4,Dorman Window Regulator w/Motor,"Received and installed a month ago and seems to be working just fine. I had no problems installing the unit as the mounting points matched up perfectly. I have worked with other Dorman products and find them of good quality. I would certainly recommend this product. Although its only been a month, I hope I am not being to generous with this review. Oh, and the price was right with free super saver shipping. Thanks Amazon..."
5,"Great price, easy install","Dorman 741-649 Dodge Dakota/Durango Front Driver Side Power Window Regulator with Motor (Purchased on 04/08/2011)If you know how to use a socket wrench, screw driver and a roll of tape, you are an expert at installing this product. A perfect match for the stock bolt holes. If you're still not sure there are utube videos showing how to do it. Don't give your hard earned money to the dealerships for something that will take you a half hour to do yourself."
5,Great!,This item arrived quickly and was a perfect replacement for the old one that had seen a few too many drive up windows!
5,Durango Regulator,"This power window regulator was a great purchase! Once I received the part, I put it on right away and it worked perfectly. The included instructions were right on the money too! The dealer wanted twice as much for just the regulator. Amazon had the regulator and motor for only half the price. Hopefully I can look forward to more great deals from Amazon!"
5,Amazing!,This product was so easy to install and my window works like new. It got here in two days! I would definately purchase the same product again and order throught the same person. Thank you!
3,Your run-of-the-mill Dixieland CD.,"Not much real ""impressive"" stuff on this album. It's pretty much run-of-the mill Dixieland standards. If you want really good Dixieland, ""Our Man in New Orleans"" by Al Hirt is a great album. ""Louis Armstrong of New Orleans"" is also another great Dixieland classic. I'd recommend buying those two before you get this one."
4,Yin and Yang - She's got it right,"I've just gotten the book and haven't had a chance to read it yet but I did want to respond to the person who said her boyfriend told her Christina Pirello had her Yin and Yang mixed up. Your boyfriend is incorrect, Pirello's classification of Yin and Yang is the standard in Macrobiotic diet/philosophy. Your boyfriend might want to read one of Michio Kushi's books for more detail."
3,Okay advice... unless you eat animals.,"There was a lot of interesting advice, and I enjoyed the thoughts it provoked. However, I got the constant feeling that becoming vegan would solve all of my problems. It seemed like every condition was because I was eating animal products. I know that some people are vegan and that's fine, but I'm not for health and taste reasons, and so I found myself at sort of a dead-end with this book. Also, the self-diagnosis was a little difficult; there are only so many ways to describe bumps on your face."
5,excellent,This book was full of excellent information. It was an easy and enjoyable read. The recipes are also great the only downfall is the cost of these recipes but in the end health and beauty are worth it.
5,Tasty recipes!,"This book has a lot of interesting things to think about as far as listening to what your body is telling you, and reminds us that you are what you eat! What I love most about this book is the recipes, though. Mmmmmm! The Mushroom Bread Pudding, Lemon Poppyseed Poundcake, and Crispy Tempeh with Sweet Mustard Sauce (among many others) are must have recipes for anyone who wants to eat well and live healthy while indulging in deliciousness!"
3,Not much new,"Pirelli does a nice job recycling the standard macrobiotic approach to health (and beauty as a by-product). The complaints about the yin and yang classifications aren't Pirelli's fault--they go back to Georges Ohsawa and his dharma heir, Michio Kushi, who changed the old Taoist classifications to suit their agenda, and possibly simplify explanations. Pirelli's a little looser and more fun than Kushi though--easier reading."
2,Sad excuse for a game,"I've had this game for years and yet I've never been able to beat it. Made by Toy headquarters (Whose reputation has gotten better over the years)It is one of the many games that followed an obscure series of Bullwinkle and rocky. The game has several flaws including Control, Poor sound quality and the inability to avoid taking damage.Controlwise, Your character tends to slide and jumps are very difficult to land, especially if you use Rocky's ""flight jump"" move.The sound is another big problem that I had. It is somewhat bland. In one level, there is an attack that enemies can use that causes the music to go high pitched and distorted.In most games, when you take damage, you flash which gives you time to get around an obstacle that damaged you, in Rocky and Bullwinkle, you don't get that temporary invinciblity. This makes the gameplay extremely difficultOverall scoreControl:1 starsound:1 starfun factor:1 starNot a very good game."
1,Bad listing,This product was listed in the LPs section (meaning on vinyl). When I received it it was a CD. Bad job on Amazon's part not putting products where they should be.
4,One man's development,in the world of sexual submission and masochism via the services of professional dominants. That is the first part of this novel from Grant Antrews. It is a detailed account of Jeremiah's arranging a session with a professional dominant and then the session itself. This is a well-written piece of fiction. However the second part of the novel is less well structured. It jumps back and forth between time periods in Jeremiah's life without clear markers either in the form of dates or verb tenses or even clear signal words until paragraphs into a chapter. This second part is more about this one man's past and how it affects his vanilla marriage until it becomes something inline with his desires. The emotions are especially raw in part two and while I can't say I like Jeremiah as a person I can say I understood him a bit better by the novel's end.
5,The Young Man and The Sea,"The Young Man and the Sea is a wonderful book by Rodman Philbrick. This book is realistic fiction. I would rate this book with two thumbs up! The main character in this story is a boy named Samuel Skiff Beaman. Samuel is twelve years old and lives with his dad. They live in Spinney Cove. Samuel's Mom just died from a disease. Samuel is a boy who never gives up. One day riding home from school, a rich kid named Tyler Croft, bumped in to Samuel. Tyler Croft is a mean boy that always says mean stuff about Samuel's family. Samuel never believes the stuff Tyler Croft says. When Samuel got home, he saw his dad, Samuel Skiff Bea-man, was sitting on the couch holding the T.V. remote. Samuel just found out that the Mary Rose had sunk at the dock. He needs all the help he can get to catch one of those big blue fin tuna to fix the engine."
5,The Young Man and The Sea,"The Young Man and the Sea is a wonderful book by Rodman Philbrick. This book is realistic fiction. I would rate this book with two thumbs up! The main character in this story is a boy named Samuel Skiff Beaman. Samuel is twelve years old and lives with his dad. They live in Spotter Hill Harbor. Samuel's Mom just died from a disease. Samuel is a boy who never gives up. One day riding home from school, a rich kid named Tyler Croft, bumped in to Samuel. Tyler Croft is a mean boy that always says mean stuff about Samuel's family.

Samuel just found out that the Mary Rose had sunk at the dock. He needs all the help he can get to catch one of those big blue fin tuna to fix the engine."
4,I Had to Finish It,"When I first started reading this book I thought it was very boring. When it neared the end at the part when Skiff is trying to catch the bluefin tuna, I couldn't put it down. On an overall basis in words it was a good book. I don't know if I would suggest it to other readers though."
4,The Young Man and the Sea,"Rodman Philbrick has done it again with his stories of finding strength and character in a young boys life. Skiff Beaman refuses to be bullied or live a miserable life which seems like what his father has done since the death of his wife. He sets a goal for himself and rises to the challenge in a wonderfully told story. I loved Freak the Mighty and loved this book. I would highly recommend this ""feel good"" book."
1,Laughin about what ...,"I choose this book due to this review ""The best cartoon book for Spanish students remains 'Laugh 'n' Learn Spanish : Featuring the #1 Comic Strip 'For Better or For Worse'"". My guess is you need to be North American to fully enjoy this. Definitely you will learn something. But when it comes to the laughing factor I had a much better time when watching ""La fea mas bella"". That time for me was true to the sense laugh'n learn Spanish. The book will be sent back. I hope that ""The Oxford Spanish Cartoon-strip Vocabulary Builder"" will be a much better choice."
2,Not all I expected!,"Based on all I'd read about this kit, I was prepared to love it and wear it throughout my pregnancy. Boy, was I mistaken! I have used some of the pieces some of the time, and some hardly at all. While I'm convinced I bought the right size, the dress and top fit fine, the skirt is okay, and the pants are ridiculous. The biggest issue is that the pants and skirt have no extra elastic in the waistband, nor are they higher in the front/lower in back like many maternity clothes -- so the pants just have this huge band all around that is the same width as the pants... I'm in my 37th week, and still am not big enough to keep the pants up...and they come up all the way to my bra. I would recommend buying the pieces as separates, and probably skipping the pants."
2,Not the APA guide I thought it was,This book is not quite what it is portrayed to be. And the CD-ROM is so general in nature that it really is not that helpful. If you need information on APA-style then by the official APA guidebook.
2,music review,i must agree with some people on here that this film is a classic and the music/lyrics are great... but they have cut out those little intumental scences which made the fil so great.. been looking for the composer who made the music where carrie and the boys are playing in the libary.. can anyone help
2,I am a little disappointed,"I couldn't get the automatic feature to kick in. The pump works very well in the manual mode but not in the automatic. To be fair, I misplaced the installation directions- but there are after all only 3 wires."
2,this is not a automatic pump should be recalled,"this pump should be taken of the shelf,should not be sold as a automatic pump, it is a pump that starts and stops every two and a half minutes"
1,Will not pump.,"Bought this item expecting it to be an automatic float switched pump. Turns out it is not. It is a pump that turns on every 2 minutes and 30 seconds to check if there is water then pumps, does not operate with traditionally float switch.I thought that this could work to my advantage so wired it up and placed in bucket of water. The pump clicks but does not pump. Will work in manual mode with Brown and White wire connected, However with just the brown wire connected it does nothing but clicks every 2 mins or so.Very Disappointed."
5,Ready for boating season again,"The bilge pump came quick and helped out a lot, the old one froze up over the weekend and we had to bail water with a cut open water bottleThanks"
4,"An anthology that wears well, very well","This collection begins with an old standard by the Cox Family setting a familar tone which is quickly broken. ""Wayfaring Stranger"" is the only other standard Gospel number but its execution with a bluesy clarinet is anything but standard; bluegrass clarinet works splendidly. Hazel Dickens provides a mother/memory piece in ""Faded Pressed Rose"" - she delivers an intensely emotional piece without ever sounding sacchrine. The Stevens Sisters' bluesy rendition of ""In My Time of Dying"" balances death and faith in well balanced close harmony. And OlaBelle Reed cuts us all down to size in a riveting performance of ""Six Feet of Earth Makes Us All of One Size"".This anthology provides the high quality variety that allows one's favorite to change with each change in your mood, providing a good introduction to several of Rounder's bluegrass women."
4,Good Collection,"I'm not a diehard gospel fan, but something about it calls me. This collection is mostly strong, with a few I don't like, but that's what you get with any collection. I enjoy this collection nonetheless."
3,It's okay,"As with any CD, there are some great new songs and some not so great... It's ok for listening as I drive."
3,overpriced...,"I was disappointed with this watch for the price. It is very heavy and plain. The hands barely light up at all--not enough to tell time in the dark. No indiglo. If you're buying this watch, you are buying the name. It is a Wenger and looks nice on my husband but his eyes did not sparkle when he opened it."
3,D & D Third Edition,"This is compatable with third edition D & D. A number of new classes such as the knight and its variants like Knight Templar are given. It is a campaign setting based on the Arthur mythos (ie Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, Ravenloft). Boosts up existing classes such as the paladin who has a number of powerful spells. Overall I would recommend it, but IMO it lacks depth."
4,Very nice psycho drama thriller,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a very goodpsychological thriller. Good story line and well acted. Cristina Brondo playsa psychiatrist working in a hospital for the insane. Her life comes undone asshe can not tell fantasy from reality. The plot line of this film is very muchlike that of the film SHUTTER ISLAND. Brondo is a lovely and talented actressand is very good in her lead role. This was very much worth the VOD rental price.
5,hipnos,"A fine psych-thriller. Cristina Brondo tears this up, with BichirTodo el Podergiving it the edginess it needs."
5,Great satire,"I caught the tail end of the Li'l Abner series as a child in the 1960's and remember loving it. I recently started looking for some collections in libraries, but couldn't find any so I looked on Amazon and found this volume and bought it. I've had a great time reading it and even though the things it satirizes occurred before I was born, I'm familiar with much of them through my study of history. Much of what is satirized is applicable to any time and is still fresh.I've recently been reading some of the classic satire of Voltaire (Candide) and Rabelais (Gargantua and Pantagruel) and this seems to fit right in with that style. I guess I have a warped sense of humor. I wish today's comics were this good.I enjoyed the artwork and appreciated the explanations at the end of the book highlighting some of the items that someone born after that era may have missed. I highly recommend this book. I will probably order more volumes."
3,Predictable Family Fun,"We have five boys, so I am always on the lookout for movies we can watch together. I want movies that will hold the interest of my younger boys, have enough jokes that my older boys will not be bored, but not be so 'dumbed down' that my husband and I are asleep in the first 30 minutes. Not always an easy task...But ""The Gameplan"" was close enough. Dwayne Johnson was a pro wrestler, not sure of all the details, but that is a fact that caught my older boys'attention. We all enjoyed him in ""The Scorpion King,"" and my younger boys just thought it looked like a funny movie, and it was. Many of the jokes are recycled from other, similar, films and it is a rather predictable ending, though I was caught off guard by 'the twist.' But it is a sweet story, with a lovely sentiment. It's a movie you can enjoy as a family, and movies like that always rank high in my book."
2,"I wanted to like this movie, but ...","I've watched this movie twice.I very much agree with Erica J. Dymond's review, where she said:""Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson extends his considerable talents to this family-friendly film. Though the premise is a familiar one (a self-centered playboy discovers the joys of fatherhood), Johnson's charm and sincerity make it worth the watch. Likewise, Roselyn Sanchez does a tremendous job in her role as ballet-instructor Monique Vasquez. Her real-life dance-training is showcased in a poignant performance with Johnson and the children (this is one of the more enchanting scenes in the film ... it is guaranteed maintain your attention).""I'm not a dancer, and I found the dance performance scene very much ""enchanting,"" as Ms. Dymond said.Otherwise, this movie very much fell flat for me. Wildly unrealistic, sexist, and classist. A very manipulative movie on Disney's part.My daughter loved it ... so it gets two stars from me."
4,Good,"The movie was good...I have never seen the little girl in this movie play in anything else, but I thought she did a good job as being a mischievous child trying to worm her way into her father's heart. It was cute, predictable but fun to watch. I got it for my dad as a birthday gift and he liked it alot, so I would say don't worry...nothing bad, alot of cute humor and jokes, a good family film!"
5,Wonderful Movie!!,"I bought this for my daughter, who absolutely loves bulldogs, and we all fell in love with this movie. We loved the idea of a movie with good old humor and feelings for one another. It came across as very genuine, not put on as most movies today. Would recommend this to everyone."
4,The Game Plan is a good plan for a family,"I watched this movie with my wife and kids and they really enjoyed it, there were no curse words from what I could remember, of course it's a Disney film so that's always good. The characters were well acted out and the situations are funny. The Rock did a good job playing this roll, I think he was born to play this, considering he is a former football player. We really enjoyed the ""Elvis"" themes in the movie, my family and I are huge Elvis fans. Overall a good movie, heartwarming and fun. Heck even my brother who is overly critical of movies liked it. Just sit back, relax with the kids and don't expect something epic or something overly done, just simple family fun. We enjoy it always and never get tired of it. A great buy."
2,Movie was okay,"The movie had a great idea but it was not a good movie. Some of the actors could not act and it was really boring. I could not finish the movie but some of the smaller children might really like it. But as far as it appealing to children, teens and adults that is questionable. If the movie is intended to make smaller children such as 3-7 year olds laugh then it is a good movie for them. But for everyone else, bring some popcorn and a gameboy because you might need it to get through the whole movie."
5,Very good movie,I'd caught bits and pieces of the movie on tv but wanted to see it in its entirety. I ordered it new and it arrived in brand new condition. Thank you
4,"Cute, light humor","This movie works despite incredibly stiff acting by The Rock, mainly because of the cute little girl who plays The Rock's daughter looking to connect with her ""father."" The Rock plays Joe Kingman, a self-centered quarterback, who is more concerned with his image than his team or his ""newly"" found daughter.The movie moves along in a fairly predictable manner but because of the light-hearted humor and the supporting cast, the movie is still enjoyable to watch."
4,The game plan..,"A nice family movie with lots of laughter and drama.Thanks Disney, for giving the family something decent to watch!"
5,Family Favorite,"I have an 8 year old son, 4 & 5 year old daughters, and they all love this movie. There are some adult situations and content that I could do without, but they are not gratuitous and not much different than what my kids are exposed to at parties or gatherings where adults are involved, especially during the holidays. My kids are a little more interested in football, thanks to this movie. It was not my intention but I'll take it!"
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson showcases the low-key charm that will keep him in the film business for a while, but The Game Plan is so spectacularly unoffensive, unambitious and formulaic that even its well-meaning tone can't make me give it a begrudging recommendation."
4,Irresistable,It's really hard to dislike these types of movies. It's your typical boy becoming a man scenario. Peyton is adorable and their relationship is hilarious. I thought the movie was very cute. Nothing big to dislike about this fun family film.
3,Good Family Movie,"Dwayne Johnson continues to rise as a star, in this Walt Disney production movie. You and your family will surely enjoy this movie..."
4,Better Than I Expected,"Being someone who prefers to buy most movies vs. going to see them in a theater, and I'll buy kid's movies vs. renting them... this movie was better than I expected it to be. We enjoyed it and recommend it. If you're not into owning movies, it's worth renting and seeing once."
5,funny movie,"A funny family movie. A little corney,and predictable but, it's entertaining. Got to love the Rock! The little girl in the movie is cute. My preteen son loves the movie."
3,"Good ""kid"" movie","A little ""cheesy"" for adults, but good kid movie. Humorous side of a very serious situation that happens way too often in real life. Good, but predictable ending. This movie could probably help kids relate that are in situations where they do not know one of their parents. It shows that things can work out for a happy ending."
4,great condition,"this arrived in record time, and was is the exact condition described. my daughter is really enjoing this one over and overs again."
3,bad disc,"I bought this blu ray (used) and I had hoped that I got a good deal. Overall it works well but it pauses several time throughout the movie. Sometimes the disc stalled for a few seconds. I'm a little bit dissapointed with this purchase. However, the I'd give a 4 stars for the movie. It is quite entertaining."
3,it was ok,Good but way to predictable if I could I probably turn back time I probably would not buy this movie
5,The Game Plan,The Rock is a great actor and this movie is a cute comedy. Amazon always has what I need and want and the companies that provide them are good companies with good merchandise...You would enjoy this movie. A good family movie...
1,Never received,"Since I ordered this on dec 10 and still have not received it over a month later, I really can't review it. I will never order from Amazon again. I have sent them 3 emails telling them I never got the movie, but they have ignored them."
5,THE ROCK ROCKS!!!!!,"I have missed The Rock in wrestling,but he has done a couple of movies that have been great! I forgot just how funny the man is!"
2,A little uncomfortable,"While it had some minor redeeming qualities, I would say pass on this movie if you're planning on watching it with your kids. There are a few too many sexy girl party scenes for my taste -- I guess to establish the story line of the dad as a playboy -- but if you ask me, it was just creepy. Totally inappropriate for kids (mine are aged 9 and 6). Rock is a little weird to look at too -- super white teeth, giant greasy muscles. Ew. I didn't like it. But, the little girl is cute (that's the redeeming part)."
3,Meh,"I liked Dwayne Johnson better when he was in 'tough' roles like in the Mummy movies as the Scorpion King. This movie isn't terrible and it's not without its cute moments, but it's not a great movie, either. it's about a football player who enjoys his bachelor life who suddenly finds out he has a daughter. So daughter moves in and he has to get used to it, especially after she wreaks havoc on his swinging bachelor pad and lifestyle (including making his hot girlfriend mad) It's fairly cheesy, but has a few funny moments and an okay if a bit cliched ending. I saw this on TV, wouldn't have seen it otherwise."
4,3rd and Goal...,"As a lover of Pro Football (not to mention ""The Rock""), this film was worth a try for me. What a delight to find myself laughing out loud, rooting for the game scenes, eyes watering at times, and thoroughly liking all the ensemble characters.After seeing it myself a few years ago, I recently purchased it to share with our grandsons and they hooted! Tender, funny, heartwarming, a real feel good. Do yourself a favor: get in a huddle, and HIKE! ~"
4,The Rock Rocks,"The Rock proves that he can take on most any role that Hollywood throws at him. A very entertaining, family film!"
2,Don't bother reading this book.,"I think ""Bert"" is a brilliant man and a terrific author, but most (if not all) of the essays in this book are really dry and uninteresting. The best part of the book was Bertrand's discussion of what the word ""should"" means. He concludes that ""should"" in most instances mearly means that if you do x, someone specific would approve. For example, ""you should be kind to others"" means nothing more than ""if you are kind to others, those people will experience a feeling of approval regarding your actions."" Other than that, the book was pretty painful to read. I recommend Why I Am Not A Christian or Unpopular Essays instead. I give this book 2 stars because nobody should ever give Bertrand Russell one star (if you did, he would disapprove!)"
2,"Many Broken, But Still Taste OK","2/3 of the Necco Wafers were cracked even though they were packed well and the outside shipping container showed no signs of mistreatment. They still tasted fresh and are a relatively low-calorie, fat-free treat."
1,Shipping costs,The shipping cost for these Necco Candy wafers is $18.50 almost the same cost as the item. No thanks!!
3,Okay Early Wordsound Release,"This is an relatively early release on the Wordsound imprint. It is a typical lo-fi dub workout experience with Middle Eastern flavors. It is out of print and in general hard to find. Listening to it after years of searching was like many hyped releases; disappointing, however, not bad either. If you like Bill Laswell, you may like this release. The previous reviewer stated that there's rhyming on this CD: nope! That's the wrong Scarab; he's referring to the MC in the Living Legends crew."
3,Eh. It's was okay.,"I'm with the reviewers below: I love these authors. They have proven time and again that they are top notch and worth every penny. Night's Edge seemed like a hurried effort. I admit, I'm not a big fan of anthologies. I find the stories to be too quick: quick on romance, quick on character development, and quick to tie up all the loose ends created in the plot. The writing in these stories is excellent, but all have the above three problems. I initially bought this book for the Charlaine Harris story. While the concept was excellent, the story seemed to crash and burn at the end. The only thing I can say is if this is the first time you're reading anything by these three authors, be assured that their full-length novels are the real draw and these stories are just to tide us over til the next one comes out."
2,Pretty Bad,"Another collection of crappy supernatural stories, the only exception being the Charlaine Harris story. Save yourself some money and just read the Charlaine Harris short story at the bookstore!"
1,Night's Edge is a reprint,It's a shame no one mentioned this is a reprint from 2004 with the cover work and author names rearranged.
3,"3, too short stories","1) Vampires and dancers, 2) ghosts and psychics and 3) ghosts and dancers. These three short stories drew me in and i didn't want to put them down. I've recently starting reading Charlaine Harris novels and never thought I would be a vampire story addict. The truth is these books are quick paced - an easy read with enough twists and turns to keep you coming back for more. I didn't want any of these three short stories to end!"
4,Creativity,"This card pack, along with the accompanying book was both fascinating and useful. The cards provide a way to move along in the creative process when you are stuck. I am really enjoying both."
4,Think pak cards are very good,"Excellent Companion to the Thinker Toy book , I would hope also to have it as a smart phone application also as it could be excellent in group brain storming sessions. if you didn't read thinker toy, I wouldn't recommend that you purchase them alone as the message will be of lesser value."
4,Published in 2001,"HOT SPOTS is a beautiful and useful book, but it has gotten a little long in the tooth since Kalmbach published it in 2001. Time for a revised edition IMHO."
4,Good for those interested in firearms and their nuances.,"Bought this book a number of years ago. If you're interested in firearms this can be a good read. It often has more practical thoughts about the weapon under test, from more of a grunts perspective than you might expect. Numerous tidbits of trivia, history, and especially nuances of the weapon and it's usage history exist in the text. If you're interested in such things, worth the time go through it. Perhaps also worth a glance if you've an interest in using any of the covered weapons for home or boat defense.Some readers may find it odd that many of these weapons are more classic, rather than modern space aged military ordinance. It's also organized by country/date more than anything else I guess. A newer version covering more recent equipment could be most interesting."
1,A.D.D. and Creativity in 60 Seconds,"A rambling autobiographical swamp of crystal-power feel-good-isms mixed with the author's unresolved issues with ""the man.""Highlights include: a 10-year search for a cliff glimpsed in a dream, how ""they"" should take drugs to be like us, and an unintentionally amusing section where the editor chides her for writing a whole book without actually giving any practical suggestions for living with ADD.* * *I recommend Driven to Distraction instead."
4,Quiet examination of the little things,"Mrs. Taber's worries in 1959 are, surprisingly, true for today: our need for ""busy-ness"", concerns about the possible aggressive actions of other countries, the world's focus on change.But the charm of this book is Taber's quiet examination of the little things that make up her life at Stillmeadow Farm."
2,It's okay,There are no dimensions for some of the tools. And several of the tools on the cover are not in the book.
3,Not Very Interesting,I own several of the Workshop Practice Series books and this book is not interesting. Not alot of helpful tooling description. I would not waste time making most of the tools depicted in the book. Not because they are not handy but I have picked up most of these elsewhere for less than the cost of the material to make them. I you are looking for pratice then the projects in the book maybe worth you time. Book was delivered quickly and in better condition than indicated online.
5,For grown ups and kids!,"Right along with Codename: Kids Next Door, a cartoon that adults and kids will enjoy. Very original and very funny!"
3,meh,"I got this and havent worn it yet. It is that enchanting.It doesnt fit well, I would be scared to wash it, and doesnt look that good on me."
5,Premiere has the potential to be one of the best R&B groups.,Somethin' About You is a great song and I recommend it to everyone
4,Flexible closet organizer,"I liked the idea of getting one of these closet organizers because every piece of hardware, every bracket, every screw would be included, and there would be no extra trips to the hardware store because you didn't get the right equipment, or you forgot a piece...that always seems to happen to me. It arrived quickly, everything in order. To install, you should have a stud-finder (unless you're one of those super cool people who can find a stud by knocking on the wall), and a 1/4 inch drill bit. My husband had some frustrations, but overall it wasn't too bad. I do really like all the options you have to arrange your closet, and you can store a lot of stuff with this system. One thing I would like to note: I don't know how it could fit in a 5-foot closet. I figured the two top brackets would slide into each other for smaller areas, but it didn't. It fit in our closet, but that's just something to think about."
5,can't go wrong,"easy installation... and presto chango, cheap closet organization. It takes 10 minuets to screw in the initial bracket, and then from there its cake. You just need to figure out how you want it laid out. that's the hard part :)"
5,easy assembly and great organization,"This is an awesome organizer, it was super easy to put together (do have a drill handy) and has worked wonderfully for my daughters closet. It gave us so much more storage space! Truly nothing bad to say about it, thinking about buying another for our guest room closet."
1,Poor customer service,"We bought about 1200.00 worth of closetmaid products which came to about 16 boxes. In about half of those boxes items were missing. Among the missing were bags of hardware which made it impossible to put it together. All the time our closets were emptied of their contents and spread around the house. We called customer service and were told to go back to the store and ask them to open other boxes and take the missing parts from them, of course they would not do this. We were then told that it would take 5 to 10 days to ship the parts. This type of treatment is unacceptable but they seem not to care. An e-mail was also sent in complaint but no response was received"
5,Quality shelving,"ClosetMaid 2897 shelftract is much stronger than previous units I've owned. Also all the pieces were included and extras. It was an easy assembly. I did adjust the top rail so that I could hit studs all the way across and then ran the v erticle braces along the stud also, making it so sturdy that my wall will fall down before this unit does.Very satisfied."
1,why switch a good thing,my wife cant stand the new downy smell.it irritates her skin. customer service at proctor and gamble no help at all.take it or leave it attitude.30 year customer downy the drain.
1,New scent pearls = epic fail!,The new scent is so strong and foul that I will be forced to find a replacement product if P&G doesn't return to the original formulation. It's no longer April Fresh. I've used this product for over 30 years and I'm very disappointed!
5,Very good for baby clothes,My wife has nasal allergies and very sensitive to scents. She has used several types of softners but this has been the BEST she's used. She even uses a small amount on our baby's clothing.I highly recommend it!
1,New formula smells toxic,"I just hate what they did to Downy. The new formula is a piercing, tart chemical imitation of the original. It also irritates our skin and makes everyone feel itchy and red. In addition, it doesnt perform any better than the original. They must be insane to change such a classic product."
1,Overpowering scent! Nasty!!!,"I have used Downy April Fresh for years, but this new version has me switching brands. The scent is SOOOO overpowering it made my entire family nauseous and gave us headaches. BAD idea, Downy!"
1,"new formula, bad smell","Downy has reformulated its scent with the new ""scent pearls."" The new scent is biting and unpleasant compared with the older, more subtle version of April Fresh. After decades of loving Downy, I'm looking for an alternative that is not so overpowering. If you read reviews of this product, and if you care about scents, keep in mind whether the review is dated before or after the introduction of ""scent pearls."""
1,New April Fresh Downy With Scent Pearls,"New April Fresh Downy with scent pearls is horrible. I've used Downy for years, and I always loved it. It was subtle and smelled great. The new scent is overpowering and very strong (perfume). For those who are ordering April Fresh Downy, if you end up getting the older version, you will love the smell and most likely will have a very positive comment/ review. But for those who end up getting the new scent, you will find that it is very strong (perfume), and will probably give it a low rating. When ordering April Fresh Downy, you may be shipped the original April Fresh Downy without the added scent pearls (since the old batches are mixed in with the new), so be careful- it's hit or miss. Too bad they changed the smell. The new smell is really bad, and I would not recommend it."
1,"Zero Stars! New ""Scent Pearls"" smell is nasty! Don't buy it!","I can't believe P&G; changed the smell of Downy! I've been using it for years. The only reason I use the liquid fabric softener in the first place is because the original scent is so awesome, but this new ""Scent Pearls"" stink is nasty! It perverts the smell of the original to the point where I've actually gotten a headache from it! It's horrible! I never noticed the new packaging because it's pink like it used to be, but now it stinks! And I can't find any of the old bottles anywhere, so I guess it's back to Bounce dryer sheets for me. It's sad. It's like changing Coke to New Coke and adding a little bit of extra melted plastic taste to the New Coke, then not bringing back Coke Classic!Actually, I think that's the smell that's giving me a headache: It's a chemical, slightly melted plastic smell. At first, I thought I was imagining it, but it's really bad!PLEASE! Bring back the old scent! Kill the 'Scent Pearls!'"
1,SCENT PEARLS STINK!,"I cannot believe how offensive the Downy ""scent pearls"", well...scent, is. I have contacted P&G to advise them I would no longer purchase the product because of it. It filled my laundry room with such an overpowering odor, I still can't get rid of it. My family HATES it; even the dog ran from the room. If you are at all sensitive to fragrance (believe me, this does not rate as a fragrance), do not purchase this product. Too bad P&G didn't adhere to the adage, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". There was nothing wrong with the lovely, gentle ""April Fresh"" scent, period. They have ruined half of my laundering experience; hopefully, they keep their mitts off my Tide."
2,Does not work,"I got a really good deal on this from Amazon. I had not tried it before and that was my mistake. This stuff has no fragrance but it also does not work. I used twice as much as the regular Downy, and it still did not soften my clothes. I should have bought one bottle locally for trial before ordering a case."
4,Saved by 5/4,"I have been eagerly awaiting this release, and was even more excited when I learned that 5/4 was an instrumental track, which is something totally new for Rammstein. However, the rest of the single isn't worth much, because the remixes are rather bad, and they make the song ""mutter"" lose all of its luster and meaning. But getting this is worth it for 5/4, which is one of the coolest tracks rammstein has ever recorded"
2,Inferior Product Support,"At Fry's Electronics I bought the GH5850 phone and 3 GH58 additional satellite handsets to wirelessly tether off it. I wound up at Amazon hoping I would find some clue as to how to get the satellite handsets to register with the base phone. I followed the procedure in the handbooks, but the satellite phones didn't recognize the base phone. There was nothing relevant in the troubleshooting section of the handbook. When I went to SWB's website, the *.pdf version of the handbook was ""temporarily"" unavailable. When I called there product support line, I found that they were not open according to the hours listed in the handbook. I will have to wait 2 days to talk to anyone. I have never found a phone of this type as inexpensively priced. Perhaps I am getting what I paid for?!?!"
5,Can't complain,I got the base unit for about $30 when it was on sale at FRY'S + 2 more handsets for $10 each. I had no problem at all registering hand sets with the base at all. It work right away at a first try. I was looking for 5.8GHz unit as I was trying to avoid interference with my wireless network at home. Got the phones for about 7 months now and all units work well and I can even go out of the house to the mailbox and not loose reception.
5,Do you remember the forests?,"I am struck by the other reviews of this important book: The reviewers from the West coast (who are watching the forests fall) give it high marks, while the mid-west reviewers (where the forests fell long ago) are more concerned with the tone of the book. I invite those midwesterners to come visit their western woods while some still remain. Then reread this book and see if you can share some of that anger."
1,Pass on it,"Catchy title, but you'd do better without it. The only thing hidden in this book is the information. Try finding, for instance, the Garden of the Gods using this book; you'll be hopelessly lost and lucky to find your way back to the hotel. Same for several of the beaches, waterfalls, and so forth. One has to wonder whether the author actually visited the places he's written about or just looked them up in other books. There are some good guidebooks for Hawaii out there, but, unhappily, this is not one of them. I'd pass on it."
1,this book was terrible,it was very unorganizedmaps were almost non existent throughout the bookreviews were bias towards EVERYTHING IN HAWAII IS GREAT when in reality many things in hawaii are not that great but the author doesnt specify which ones are or are notvery hard to read non preciseBIG WASTE oF MONEY you are better off going there and getting the free brochures they will tell you a lot more
4,Sophistical review and summary,"This book was recommended to me by a friend and I found it to be very educational and insightful. The book arrived from the seller promptly and in very good condition. The author is very knowledgeable of her subject matter and writes well. The subject matter is not especially easy, though. The material requires carefull reading and maybe repeated readings for it to all sink in.A note on perspective might be important for some readers - this author appears to write from an agnostic or athiestic point of view. That's the fashional perspective for intellectuals who want to become successful in politically correct academia, and so it's easily understandable. However, the author provides essentially no insight into concepts like redemptive suffering, conversion of heart, eternal salvation, and other mainstays of Christianity (and much of Judaism). For someone seeking an enlightened Judeo-Christian insight into good and evil, this book might NOT fit the bill."
5,Timey Context to Discuss Evil,"There are already many books about 9/11, but I have read nothing that manages to be so relevant and so historically sharp. Evil in Modern Thought puts 9/11 in the context of three centuries of thinking about evil, and revitalizes our thinking about both of them. This book is not only deep and informative; it gives you courage."
4,Great Jeans,Very cute and fit my daughter perfectly. When she out grew them I handed them down to my god-daughter. She loved them as well.
2,How to spoil your grandkids,When I finished it in.less than 10 min I was highly disappointed!!! Seemed more like a kids book. There were lots more ideas she could have given and should have given BitTorrent she's charging for sure!!
3,Comedy Grandparent Book,"My friend found it mildly amusing. She said it was clear that the person who wrote it did not have grandchildren or much insight in children. She said she felt the humor was contrived and ""strained."""
1,don't waste your money,"after reading some other posts, i thought i'd buy this for my 5-year-old daughter. at the very least, i thought we could grow a few cultures of bacteria and mold from her hands, feet, the sink, etc. i'm a former biology teacher so i thought it would be a fun experiment. well, after following the directions to make the gelatin, the solution still was too watery. we tried it again, doubling the gelatin, and still encountered the same problem. (by the way, one petri dish came cracked) the other ""experiments"" are a total joke--mash up bread and vinegar in a balloon and squeeze it out on a plate? that's supposed to show you about digestion? mix gelatin, water and a drop of green food coloring to make snot? really, i can't believe some of the other reviews that talk about doing this with their class and learning vocabulary?! the vocabulary i saw was ""eeeewwwwwhhh! grooosssss!"" and it really wasn't gross. i'm at a loss for how this thing gets so many stars... big waste."
4,Great Fun for 7 and 4 year old,"Yes, the price is a bit much considering what comes in the box - that's why 4 rather than 5 stars. However, I don't know that I've ever come across guar gum or valerian root powder in my routine shopping or otherwise. So you pay a few extra bucks for convenience - big deal. The kids have an absolute blast and they are loving learning about science with hands on experiments. Bacteria, molds, snot, gag, digestion, blood - what's not to love? We've completed all but two of the experiments and they've all been easy with results as described. We're waiting for our cultures (snot, dog slobber, toilet rim stuff, and a little girl mouth swap) to grow out so we'll have to wait and see on that one. Unlike one of the other reviewers, our prep of the gelatin for the petri dishes went beautifully. Plus, there are enough supplies to do all of the experiments more than once if you are willing to rinse out the balloon and a few other easy things. We all highly recommend."
4,"Good, dirty fun","My son is a science lover and this was a cute little kit. Requires supervision, and a tolerance for mess."
2,disappointed.,"nephew was disappointed when he opened this for christmas. not enough fun stuff to play with, and it seemed like the product is geared toward adults to prepare everything and have the child watch. boring."
2,science kit,wasn't impressed with this kit. The plastic petry dishes break easily and the tubes do not seal well. The kit is messy and my 10 old daughter needed a lot of help to do the projects. She lost interest in it quickly.
4,Great Gift,I bought this for my nephews for a Christmas gift and they loved it. They played with it for days on end.
1,Waste of MONEY!,"Saw this on Amazon & wish-listed it, went to store because it was cheaper by $6, opened it up before I left store, THANK GOODNESS. Household junk I know is in my kitchen somewhere. Put it back on shelf immediately. Don't be fooled by cute box."
2,"Great fun, great teaching opportunities, but little in box","This is a fun and convenient kit containing some gelatin, sugar, yeast, a balloon, four petri dishes, a magnifying glass, and some red and green food coloring. Also a few pages, perhaps 6, of projects/instructions.The kids and I are having fun with this, but then I am in education and was a bio major. So that helps.For this to be really worth it, it would be nice if it came with a few more projects, or perhaps an actual book for the kids to read."
4,review,I got this for my 10yr autistic son.He did mostly by himslef. Direction are easy.Had good materials. Not a lot of educational info tho.We had to use web.
2,Lame,We have tried several science kits now and this one offered nothing that we couldn't do with minimal internet research for project ideas. My 5 year old was very excited at the concept that it would be disgusting.
4,Fun and Educational,I purchased these science kits for my 2 oldest grandsons and they are having fun with these and learning without probably knowing that they are learning.
3,The hero is an idiot!,"I simply couldn't stand Hunter. He was so rude! He treated Elyssa with no respect, called her Sassy even though she hated it, thought she was a flirt and reprimanded her in front of other people. My favorite part of the book was when she ignored him and he felt bad about it. I don't know what she saw in him and why she fell in love with an idiot who mistreated her all the time. After they made love for the first time the story got a bit better. But then, all the gunfighting got in the way of the story. Well, if you can stand a hero you want to strangle, this is a book for you ;)"
3,June Nolen author of In Reverse Time,"A western romance set in Wyoming right after the Civil War.The character of Hunter was very hard to like. Yes he had had a bad marriage and didn't trust women because of his now dead wife.His assumptions, of all women, carried over to Elyssa, the owner of her own ranch. He makes remarks about her clothes and treats her as if she's inferior.They finally fall in love and there is a happy ending but it's bitter sweet. Somehow I think Elyssa was just fine on her own."
3,NOT A VERY GOOD BOOK,"I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE ""AUTUMN LOVER"" WHEN I BOUGHT IT, AND ACTUALLY IT WAS A GOOD BOOK IN THE BEGINNING, BUT WHEN I GOT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOK, I STOPPED LIKING IT. I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY HUNTER HUMILIATED ELYSSA THINKING SHE WAS NOT A VIRGIN. THE REST OF THE STORY DIDN'T GET ANY BETTER EITHER. THEY KEPT HAVING SEX, BUT NOT OUT OF LOVE, ONLY FOR LUST. AND DESPITE HUNTER HUMILIATING ELYSSA, SHE STILL LIKES HUNTER AND WANT TO BE CLOSE TO HIM!I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
2,"Started Good, But!","Started out holding my interest, but as the story progressed, I became quite tired and bored with Hunter's constant opinion of Sassy as a flirt, etc. The level of writing became intellectually simple, a story more for the adolescent population. It was a reminder of how women were, and are still to some extent, blamed for man's lust, desire, physical reaction, etc. Men, all of us, need to be more accountable for our behaviors and feelings and stop blaming things outside ourselves. I have Winter Fire and I hope it's better than this one."
2,Good songs.Not originals.,"This albun contains Kaoma's songs (Lambada,Dancando Lambada,etc),but sung by a Latin group (in Spanish/Portuguese). Is not as good as Kamoma's,and Brazilian band's."
3,fun but it dont work in my yobo,the game is great but if you own a yobo (nes knockoff) dont buy this game cuz it dont work in that machine. i tried 2 or 3 different cartridges.
5,Big Improvement,"I really love Jamie Oliver's style of cooking; simple, easy, and food that anyone can create..."
2,The recipes don't turn out right,"I don't know why the recipes in this book don't turn out right. Every recipe I tried has been a disaster, not to mention required an extremely expensive list of ingredients (porcini mushrooms and arugula anyone?). Jamie Oliver puts on a great show, but the food just doesn't seem to live up to the ""easy peasy"" hype. His ""My favorite curry"" with ""Lemon rice"" took almost 3 hours from prep to finish and tasted horrible. I won't be buying another Jamie Oliver book."
5,Just what we were looking for,We looked for this rare video for many years. There it was on amazon.Quick delivery and excellent service. thanks.
4,Captivating,"Nat Willis-- a man of his times, a man for our time? I loved this roguish tale! Baker has slavishly peeled away layer upon layer of this most American onion, this slice of the American pie, this antibellum antihero whose antics and excesses are still a hoot in our 'modern' society. Couldn't put it down. Expensive, though-- and too bad the pictures weren't bigger."
1,snarky smarty-pants,Existence may be inexplicable. Consciousness is an inexplicable miracle. Time is our enemy because we will inevitably lose our consciousness. Wise people will try to use the time they have to seek out and create love and beauty. The author is a snarky smarty-pants who belittles people for the choices they make in trying to live responsible lives.My reaction to this book (stupid windbaggery) will no doubt kick me off the high intellectual plane of the other reviewers.
2,Not Up to Par,"""Millennium People"" pales in comparison to ""Empire of the Sun"" and ""Crash."" In addition, the book's characters and premise are not believable and the ending is incongruous"
2,no good,"When I tested the perfume I really liked the smell, but once you use it, the perfume turned out that the smell is not persistent, ie fades very quickly, do not know why, but it's pretty disappointing."
1,The perfume was broken,"when we received the box was opened, and the perfume is leaking! i would like to receive another one or my money back!"
1,Breaks after a month...stay away,"My grandson loved this toy because of the sounds and the lights. A month later it wasn't working at all. We thought it was the batteries and changed them, but sure enough nothing was working. We called Tonka and then they passed us off to the company that manufactures them...P.S. I still haven't heard from them and it's been almost 5 months. It's not worth the money! I highly recommend you buy some other brand of firetruck for your lil'firefighters"
3,Simple and fun,"It's a nice starter firetruck. It seems durable enough to withstand child play. The doors open and close and it comes with a little fireman. The ladder also slides up and down. Be careful though, the ladder doesn't feel very durable.My daughter likes it!"
1,I am a dinosaur when it comes to toys.,"I just recieved this toy in the mail. It has been a long time sence I have bought a Tonka toy. Not at all like theone I bought for my son in 1973. I did not think it would be the same, but the degree of decline in quality isa let down."
2,Never worked at all,"My three year old grandson got this truck as a gift from his great grandmother. It wasn't working so we thought that the batteries were dead and changed them, but it still doesn't work. Although he has fun playing with it as is, it's not what we expected."
4,No DVD,"I bought this toy as a Christmas gift for my 4 year old nephew. The main selling point for me was that it came with a DVD - however, the fire engine I received DID NOT come with a DVD, so that was kind of dissapointing. Overall though for the price it is still a great toy for a 4 year old little boy - his eyes lit up!!I just don't reccommend it if you are banking on getting the DVD. If not, but it up - it's great!"
3,toddler firetruck,Overpriced. Fun for a 2 year old. Tonka used to make a better firetruck that also squirted water. This one is a ladder truck but you have to lengthen the ladder by hand.
4,Snitchin!,"I hate to run my big mouth , but I have to tell you about Ex$pendable! This movie takes you right into the streets of Philly. And not to mention the violence and crime feels real. There's a good combination of action and drama. Gary Sturgis and the cast took to their roles very well. I don't wanna give up all the goods,so be sure to check it out for yourself."
2,Not very fun,"I bought this game because I saw that it was one of the few NES games which went four player and I wanted to utilize my four score and have a few more cool multiplayer games. Unfortunately, this game is a big disappointment. I wanted to like it, I really did! But compared to similar games, this one is just lacking. It reminds me a lot of Might and Magic, but the gameplay just doesn't work as well. And the multiplayer just doesn't work either; additional players can only attack when it's their turn during battle. In short, they occasionally get to push one or maybe two buttons every once in a while.I give the game two stars because it seems like good effort, but in the end it just doesn't work as an enjoyable game."
3,Maxine almost maxed,"This is a nice, if underwhelming overview of Maxine Brown. Her biggest hit,""Oh No Not My Baby"" has been covered by such disparate artists from Manfred Mann to Rod Stewart. She stills sounds best. Others here have complained that is there no duets w/ Chuck Jackson. I say leave it to Chuck on his complilation. Maxine Brown might always be just an elbow nudge, a lamp lit low, a sweet semi- out of tune songstress...but it winks like a grin half sinned oh now what next.."
4,Good Unit,"This is a very good cordless drill with plenty of torque. Itis however a bit on the hefty side and does not have an attachment location for keeping a screwdriver bit. This can be inconvenient for some applications. Overall a well made and reliable tool. It has come in handy for many jobs already, and I have only had it for a few months."
5,Enjoy learning in group programs,"I have seen this program in action and it's a joy. Everyone is cared for, enthusiastic,included,having fun and learning. As a bonus, these principles are equally applicable to coaches of any sport and even valuable for corporate training. A real winner!"
2,Good Drill -- Expensive Batteries!,"This lightweight drill performed well, but the batteries did not last long and and too expensive to consider replacing. I'm going with a different brand next time."
2,Case can't handle its own torque,"I would not recommend this tool. I used the drill with a 3/4"" auger bit and as I used it the plastic handle cracked open along the rubber backing pinching my hand pretty badly in the process. Additionally, the chuck doesn't seem to hold onto bits very well in hammer mode. Once you really start pounding away with a masonry bit, the chuck loosens itself and the bit falls out regardless of how tight it was when you started."
1,Complete utter waste.,I don't know what else to say besides for the title. This is beyond a waste of time. The first couple of chapters keep you going into the utter waste of time of the rest. Can't believe I wasted my time reading this. Don't even bother unless you like awful writing along with a bad story.
5,Golden Retriever,"The Golden Retriever is awesome. You'll have to practice a bit with it and go ahead and tie on the bigger string or get yourself more string you'll need it trust me( and sure its strong,nylon preferably."
4,DiscDiver,"Product really works well if you can see your disc. Easy toss and it will pull it right out. Blind throwing doesn't work too well, but it helped to get someone else's disc back to them.I was surprised how sturdy it is. I caught is on an Xmas tree someone threw into the pond, and it took two of us to pull it back, but we reeled the tree in from about 20' and it didn't bend the retriever. Am going to buy a second one so we can have one with the long string, and one short. HIghly recommend!"
4,disc golf retriever,"Love this retriver, does just what its supposed to do, i have used it for disc in 30 foot creeks and got em back with little or no problem. Great product!!"
5,This device works great and has saved me lots of plastic.,"This retriever is so small and light weight and works extremely well. It is actually fun to use. Sometimes I throw my disc in the water just so I can use my retriever. OK, maybe that isn't true but I do use it often. It is amazing how far you can throw this thing and how easy it is to use."
4,Good to own,"I've lost a few discs in the water and usually ended up in the water to get them. Now, I just whip out my retriever and throw it in after my disc. It's a great disc gold accessory to own because it has saved several discs."
5,The prof can tell a good story...,"Allen Ballard knows how to tell a good story. His characters come alive as we accompany them through the tragic events in 1864-1865 western Mississippi. Both white and black characters come across as real people, and I was sorry to leave them when the book was all-too-soon finished."
3,So long forever!,"This CD features the Top 20 finishers in 1990's annual barbershop quartet competition. This is a live recording from The Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America 1990 convention. The Top Five quartets get two songs each on the CD, while the rest of the Top 20 get one song each. The songs are flawlessly sung, and if you enjoy this time of music, you should get this CD."
5,Great artist,"Jon is an exceptional guitarist, singer, songwriter, and overall musician. This is the better of his two CD's (the other is ""Missing Ewe"") by far. Every track has a great groove, and each has its own message that can apply to just about everyone. Most of all, he is real. His music is stuff from him, from his heart, not just stuff he pulled out of nowhere to please a crowd. My dad used to play with him and his brother decades ago, struggling for gigs and such. Now Jon is the only one still playing (though it's not without good reason). He deserves to be a big name, but his albums are barely avaiable anywhere and he's pretty much only known locally (upstate New York).Perhaps if there's interest on Amazon he can get more sales!"
5,Rummy Squares & Yacht,I thoroughly enjoy these games; plan to try to learn the other games on this disc later.
2,Not much has changed,"If you don't have a previous version of board & puzzle games I suggest you pick this up, there's lots of fun stuff to keep you busy. For those that do have earlier version I don't recommend it. The new games aren't even built with the normal Hoyle interface (just other companies games launched from the Hoyle menu) and there's much better versions of those games elsewhere."
3,OK,"This set of games isn't too bad. It gives me something to do when I am bored, and that's the whole point. Some of the games are a bit tedious, but I think that relates more to personal preference than anything else.The word games are a problem, though. They were clearly not created by someone who actually speaks English. Some of the words are misspelled, and fairly common words are not accepted as words. Also, the clues in hangman and the crosswords are strange, obscure and sometimes just plain wrong.If you like word games, find something else. If you're just looking for a mindless way to kill an hour or two, this is your kind of game."
2,Backgammon is ridiculously biased toward the computer!,I enjoy playing computer backgammon but this game is ridiculous! The computer ALWAYS gives itself doubles when it really needs it and the player hardly EVER gets doubles! Also you will NEVER get a certain roll when you really need it (unlike the computer player). I counted FIVE doubles for the computer player to my ONE in a game! Ridiculous!
5,dominoes,software was easy to install and the games are quite enjoyable......we just learned dominoes and are having a blast playing it with the different opponents.
1,Not worth the money,"Dull, slow, poor graphics. One game quit working. I finally removed the all the software. I love my other Hoyle games (solitaire and word) but this one is not up to Hoyle's standards. Perhaps I should have purchased an older version of Puzzle and Board Games. Save your $ and don't buy this version."
3,Warning for Vista users,"Microsoft Vista users should know that, although the games work perfectly well in Vista, the help files do NOT work - they're apparently written in a very old Windows help format that is not supported in Vista. So, if you already know how to play the games, this is a lot of fun. If you need instructions, you're out of luck.You can go to the Hoyle site and download the help files in pdf format. But then when you want help or instructions, you have to exit the Hoyle program and open acrobat reader to read them...not very convenient."
4,Bravo!,A truly wonderful experience. Many old favorites and a few new ones to tempt you. Thank you Hoyle!!
5,the mitford years,"these books were a gift for my mother. she had the rest of the series but couldnt find these, so i told her i would look on amazon because there hasnt been a book i have looked for i couldnt find on amazon. i love my kindle and use it every day. i had stopped reading for a long time and my kindle brought that pleasure to me."
5,"Thank you, Amazon.","Thank you so much for a fast delivery and easy to order web site. It is hard to find Large Print books for my Mother. She loves the books that I ordered for her here for her Birthday.Thank you again,Mary Chandler"
4,From the Mountains to the Sea!,"Father Tim was wonderful in the latest book; I thoroughly enjoyed it. Although I missed the town of Mitford and all its characters, I came to enjoy the island community of Whitecap too. The characters at the book and bait shop were ALMOST as enjoyable as those at Percy's Main Street Grill. Barnabus' romps continued to thrill the dog lover in me. I, like many other readers, am awed by the ending. I don't quite know what to make of it at this point.....guess I'll be eagerly awaiting the next book to explain it all. All in all, a great read that, as always, leaves one waiting for 'more from Mitford'"
4,What did I miss?,"Wholesome, and down to earth book, maybe not as developed as the previous four, due to the opportuntity to build on the history established at Mitford. However, I must have missed something along the way, was the man at the end of the book in the white shirt Morris, or the outcast choir leader, who abandoned his family?"
5,"Oh so interesting, yet didn't abuse the spirit in its unfold","Jan Karon has done it again! Loved the Mitford series and thought A New Song did not disappoint me. It was a book to enjoy in the evening after a hectic day, knowing that while the happenings to the Kavanaughs were realistic,as the story unfolded it did not complicate the mind. It was a vacation away for a few hours. I looked forward to visiting with them after a hard day at work. Sure hope Karon keeps it going. We need more books like these. It's amazing that in this intense world Jan Karon can write so interestingly about simple uncomplicated people and it isn't boring in the least. I truly recommend to all readers who are fed up with the excesses and intensities and dramas of everyday life."
3,I miss Mitford!,"Reading one of the Mitford series books is like curling up in a blanket next to a warm, cozy fire on a winter's evening! I read through Jan Karon's first four books with ease and thorough enjoyment. However, I really struggled with ""A New Song"". I was becoming more annoyed with each page- wanting to get back to the beloved Mitford and the characters we love so much! I do hope the next book does just that, and the icing on the cake would be to see Father Tim and Cynthia spend a lot more time with Dooley! Thanks to Jan Karon for presenting a small corner of the world in such a heartwarming way."
1,This book was a waste of time like the others,"Two thumbs down for Jan's book. It severely disturbed my eating habits. I would recommend that all who feel inclined to buy this book, don't. Stephen King writes better than this."
3,Just not quite up to the past books,"I enjoyed A New Song --- but it just didn't come up to the standards of her previous stories. I couldn't follow the characters through the story -- found myself leafing back to refresh in my mind who they were. I did not connect with the characters in this book, as I did with the others. The story just seems to float along without much substance or ""meat"". I was just a bit disappointed."
3,I did not find this book as intriguing as the others,I have read all five of the Mitford books. This book was my least favorite of them. I found that I did not care about the characters in their new town the way I did about the people in Mitford. I hope Father Tim and Cynthia are back in Mitford for the sixth book.
5,She's done it again!,"I have read all four of the Mitford series so many times, my books are almost worn out. I wouldn't even lend them out to any of my friends for fear they wouldn't be returned, but they all bought their own and love them just as much as I do. Now I finally have the fifth one and Fr. Tim and Cynthia are just as lovable as ever along with their new parishioners. I'm on my second reading already. Please, Ms. Karon, don't ever stop writing about my special friends."
5,"The best of the series, yet.","I have thoroughly enjoyed each of the books with Out to Canaan being the best, until A New Song came along. One of my greatest pleasures is sharing them with, so far, a dozen friends who are now hooked. And I DID find the Marmalade Cake recipe in one of the Mitford Series Greeting Cards at our local Hallmark store."
1,Did not receive correct item,I ordered the used Audio CD and received the cassettes. The item only cost $6 so it was not worth my time and postage to return it. I just donated it to my local thrift store and hopefully someone that still owns a cassette player will find it. It is a wonderful story! But it is frustrating to not receive what you ordered. I won't be trying the used products again!
2,very unplausible stories,"With each passing book, the story lines seem to get thinner and thinner, which is why, I suppose, Karon decided to uproot the preacher and his wife and move them to an island 600 miles away from Mitford. A change of scenery to introduce some new people and stories. Still, it seems the main character spends most of his time either praying or saying ""consider it done."" The characters seem to lack depth and almost everyone is perfect. And the people who aren't perfect still get to have happy endings. The things that make for a good story - a character who wants something and is trying to get it against all odds, a plot that has a climax, a believable antagonist and protagonist, etc. - are lacking in this book."
2,A New Song,The Mitford series was recommended to me. I just finished A New Song. It is a bit more Christianity that I would like. I doubt if I will read other books in this series.
3,New Song Breaks away from the delightful Mitford Series,"Jan Karon's Mitford Series, Books, 1,2,3,& 4 were a refreashing delight to me. The people in Mitford became like family as I read each book. I could not wait to read the latest book in this series, ""A New Song"". However, I felt that Jan Karon should have ended the series with the fourth book. In a "" New Song"" the author has not made up her mind whether to write about the people of Mitford or those on the small island of North Carolina, thus she was unable to give substance to any of the new characters and cheated the reader out of new antics from our beloved characters of Mitford. The ending of the book was quite odd, almost making the reader think one had gotten a hold of his clergyman's Sunday Sermon. If there is a sixth book, I hope Father Tim is back in Mitford, and Jan Karon is once again focused on the Mitford Flock."
5,This book was the best one yet!,"I have read all 5 of Jan Karon's (Mitford Series),and I can hardly wait for the next one to come out. It is very hard to put her books down. Susie Carr"
5,I really enjoyed this one~,"To me, this was the most satisfying of the Mitford novels. Father Tim and Cynthia are stretched, much as we are in our everyday lives. I found myself just curious to start each next chapter. Not like a mystery page turner, of course. But I just had to know the outcomes of everything. Life isn't sugar-coated. I believe this story actually happened, which is a sure sign of a good novel."
3,Missed my old friends....,"Have been waiting for this book. Even preordered it! Found it very slow and missing the charm of the last four. Will there be another? Maybe ""Back at Home in Mitford?"" Sure hope so."
4,Such a pleasant read.,"Karon's lovingly drawn characters continue to charm, and the change of scenery in this novel adds a little life to the series. Her narrative threads get away from her a bit in this installment, but it's still a wonderful read and I will look for the next one - they're especially great on the train.I also feel compelled to point out for the benefit of those who might be misled by others' remarks that I am a 30-year old attorney - and a non-Christian - and I still find much to enjoy in this entire series."
