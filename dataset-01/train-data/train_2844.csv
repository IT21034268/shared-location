5,SO MUCH FUN!!!,This DVD is a blast...I've never seen an anime with all this behind the scenes footage!!! It is SO FUN to watch for anime fans! And gives us a real glimpse of what happens in the dubbing process. I am glad they added all the footage due to the short episode...made me feel like I was getting my money's worth!
2,Only thirty Minutes?!,"For the price I paid, I expected there to be more than thirty minutes of anime and over an hour of ""behind the scenes"" outtakes of the dubbing voice actors. The outtakes left much to be desired, and my husband & I were left wanting when the anime was over after thirty short minutes. The storyline is funny and interesting, and our heroine, Kocha spends most of the anime wearing absolutly nothing."
2,Pretty weak,"This is not a great video. For one thing, it is only one half-hour episode. Worse, it is basically a rip-off of Devil Hunter Yohko (which cannot be a surprise, with a title like that), only not as good. It is not as funny, nor are the fights as good. About the only thing going for this video is that it has a healthy dose of nudity, more than Yohko. I don't regard this title as a complete waste for that reason, but there are videos that succeed in that department and also have more going for them, like Cutey Honey. Get that before you bother with this."
5,cats love it!,i have 5 cats so i go thru scratching posts like crazy.when i saw this sisal duplex i just knew my cats would love it and sure enough they were trying to use it while i was putting it together.i'm so happy with it i ordered another 1 less than a week later.very easy to put together and your cats will love it!
2,Poorly made...,"This cat furniture is poorly made - the holes are drilled to big on two of the posts to connect on both sides. The hanging toys are on elastic strings which my cats promptly got wrapped around them and it could have been a disaster if I hadn't been at home. I cut them off.On a positive note, the top is well sewn and my cats love to lay on it, so it isn't a total loss."
2,Flimsy cat furniture,This is a very cheaply made cat play item. The carpet has no nap and seems hollow on top. The toy in the middle keeps coming off. The sissal posts are already falling apart in just a few months. I don't recommend this company at all and I have purchased many over a 30 year period.
3,Not heat-resistant,"Bought this to put in the bottom of a cooler to make a mash tun for brewing beer. On first use, threads stripped and it started leaking like crazy. Not suitable for that use."
4,One tough bumper,"As with all RPM products this is one tough bumper. I bought this for my Traxxas T-Maxx 3.3 although Traxxas products are somewhat tough enough ready to race right out of the box the kind of off road racing we do breaks parts constantly we push ours to the outer limits so far I have yet to break any parts made by RPM and have replaced all my factory parts ""A"" arms,shock towers and bumpers with RPM products. Traxxas part just don't cut it in the real world. Actually I think they're made to break so they can sell you more parts"
5,Another Great Book,"First of all, the soul of the author is very much reflected in the forwards in both of his books. Then he gets down to ""brass tacks."" This book is thought provoking, straight forward, well sourced and well written.I really enjoyed the cultural perspectives and the analysis of both classical and modern systems. It's a must read."
4,Interesting,"It is a book which will make you stop and think about your training. The history he covers is not so long that you get bored with the read and his linking of modern military to ancient warrior traditions is a new trist I think in Martial Arts writing. The sources he quotes, Draeger, Ambrose, Shelby Foote and Keegan bring a depth to the book you normally wouldn't see. I do give it four stars though simply because I'm not so sure that I liked his attitude taken towards modern training. He seems at times overly critical, but still it is a book worth reading."
1,Reds Strike The blues,"A good live album by the left wing punk/soul band the Redskins.However, I'd look out for an original copy on the Dojo record label rather than buy this reissue by the German label Mad Butcher records. As Mad Butcher records didn't pay the song writers fees and the Redskins never saw any money from this release. That's why I've only given this release 1 star."
3,"good selection, but lacking a few","A great selection in a number of ways, but missing a few major writers. Probably the most significant is Richard Powers, whose Galatea 2.2 is a major work of postmodern fiction. Bruce Sterling as well...and Cryptonomicon is a much more significant postmodern novel than Snow Crash."
5,A Text Book On Arts and Culture,"This book with it's lucid chapter introductions offers an anthology which could be useful as a textbook for a class on arts and culture in America in the second half of the 20th Century.Also, it is a good read, a nice collection of literature."
1,I would not recommend this one,"Want rockin' curls? Then DON'T use this mousse! You don't get curls in the true sense of the word, you get twisted strands of hair in some places and matted down waves in other places. I've never had a problem getting my hair to curl pefectly until I tried this mousse. It was greasy and that was reflected on how my hair looked. Greasy hair = little control, frizz-prone strands and is not voluminous."
1,Not good enough,"L'Oreal Springing Curls Mousse gave me ugly hair. After using, my curls were too big and heavy. I would have preferred a mousse better at shaping curls, better at holding curls and better at controlling curly hair. This mousse didn't cut it, not by a mile."
1,bad hair day,"Don't buy it and don't use it!! It would be a hard challenge to find a worse mousse than L'OReal Paris Studio Line Springing CUrls Mousse. Yours curls won't get volumized, your frizz won't be controled and the hold will be nominal. I could not be payed to use this mousse again."
1,change is bad,I liked this mousse better before the ingredients were changed. I used to use this mousse everyday but now I can't use it at all. It doesn't hold and it doesn't enhance curl and it takes hours for my hair to dry fully after using it. Change is bad! L'Oreal took one step backward by changing it.
1,skip this if you know what's good for you,this mousse should ideally get only half a star. it was easy to use and reasonable priced but aside from that it has nothing going for it. it didn't tame my curly hair enough and made it poof out way too much. it didn't hold enough so my hair poofed even more as the day went on. it made my hair feel nasty (it feels like it has been loaded up with moisturizers). skip this if you know what's good for you.
1,I hate this mousse!,"This mousse smells bad and the stink won't go away! This mousse takes a very long time to dry on your hair! This mousse allows your hair to frizz! This mousse gives clumpy, lopsided curls! This mousse loses its hold after a short time! Get the hint? This mousse is a piece of junk and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone! I've never reviwed a product before, but this one was so bad I just had to warn people."
1,--------Hair Scare-----------,...didn't like this one in the least....my curls were way too limp....my hair stuck out all over the place because this didn't have enough control.....had issues with frizz....
1,Stay away from this mousse!,"I couldn't believe how much this mousse stank! It made my hair really ""blah."" The texture of this mousse was very strange and it made my hair strange: my curls didn't spring up as they normally do but instead felt kind of slick, as if I had put too much product on (although I used a tiny amount of mousse). I also had real problem in that after using this mousse the ends of my hair curled slightly but the hairs on the top half of my head seemed to dry together so that my hair didn't really curl up there. I attribute this directly to the mousse because Ive never had such a thing happen to my hair (and I've used many products).I recommend staying away from this mousse! Not only does it not deliver what it says it will, I don't even think this product should be on the market at all. It doesn't in the slightest do what a traditional mousse should do, much less do what you'd expect a mousse named ""springing curls"" to do."
1,bah humbug!,"This mousse totally bites! It doesn't deliver - plain and simple. If you're looking for something to do normal things that a mousse does, like give control or curl, then you're barking up the wrong tree."
1,Worst Mousse EVER!,"This mousse has got to be the worst mousse ever. I used it in order to get some control on my curls and to enhance my curls. I did not get either. This mousse made my hair an absolute mess! The curls I got were twisted together and not defined: my hair looked as though I had one big curl. Also, the mousse didn't offer much in the way of staying power so my hair became loose and what little curl I got did not stay around for long. Finally, this mousse does nothing to prevent frizz. After my hair dried it was rather frizzy and once I went outside my hair frizzed up even worse.The bottom line is that this product made my hair look REALLY BAD and it did not do one tenth of what it advertised."
1,Infinitely Forgettable,This mousse is forgettable. It smoothed out my curls a bit but it did not enhance them. It held for only a short time. And in the humidity it made my hair frizzy and just a bit slimy to the touch.
1,Not what I expected,"Not true wurlitzer, but an import compilation that has been jazzed up or something. While there may be 50 songs on it, there are not 50 tracks, at first I thought I had beeen gyped."
2,Train wreck,"Wow. I can't say enough about the first two DVD's in the Key series. Good music and video quality, as well as interesting characters, and several wonderfully animated scenes. Many of the sequences are breahtaking, and the developing mystery is involving.As is typical in so much anime, however, the parts far outweigh the sum. By the time the series wraps up in a muddy climax where, literally, the entire audience falls asleep, I found it hard to even remember how good the early parts of Key were. Do yourself a favor, skip this disc and write your own ending. I assure you it will be better."
4,Different But Amazing Series,"By the way this applies to the KEY DVD 1&2. Like I said before Key: The Metal Idol is not your average Anime series (and a small series. Only spands 4 DVDs), but its a good one. Its one of those series that you might have to watch a couple of times before you understand it. This especially is true when you've watched one of the DVDs and then about a month later get the next one. You'll HAVE to watch the previous again! But after you get caught in the shows flow, you'll begin to love it. So what I'm saying is ""GIVE IT A TRY""!!!!"
3,Great music...shame about the show,"Key is a robot who wants to be human... for her to be human she needs 3000 friends... (sounds like a more convoluted version of Pay it Forward if you ask me)The animation is of a high standard that is for sure, but the story is slow moving and sometimes extremely hard to get grips with.However the highlight of this show is the opening and closing sequences along with the songs that accompany them. The opening theme 'In the Night' is probably one of the best songs I have ever heard in a long time, a good beat and an almost hypnotic melody. It is in fact my second favourite anime theme song, it is that good.So if you are tired of big robots and hentai, this is a good title to rent. But do yourself a favour and pick up the vocal album to Key the Metal Idol. I swear even if you dont know a word of japanese, its a good buy"
3,Short But Sweet,"This was an impulse buy for me because I really like the cover art, so I wasn't to sure about what I was getting. I am truly dissapointed because Gestalt has an interesting story with only 2 episodes on the dvd. The animation is very smooth and vibrant and the dubbing doesn't suck so its a real let down when you get to the end of the dvd and it ends just before the story really begins. I really enjoyed it so I wouldn't say don't buy it but you might not want to waste your money on it."
5,Hey hey!,"Give it a try! This is almost a new genre, considering it's Action/Sim/Strategy combo. Anyway, it's worth the (money), and is a great addition to your game collection, escpecially you Trekkies! The characters, ships, and story are somwhat tedious however, in that the Enterprise is not in it, neither are the Borg, or many Klingon and Romulan ships, oh yeah, there isn't really a story. Hmm, a good game anyway."
2,Buggy but fun,"First off a caveat: This game is riddled with bugs! If you're using old (as in more than 6 months old) drivers for your video card, sound card or even (in my case) your microsoft keyboard then prepare to have a really bad time with getting this game to run more than a few hours. However, with some effort (and a phone call to Interplay's UK tech Support hotline) I've been able to work around most of these and when it works I think it's great fun.I like the older (movie) style vessels and as a player of Star Fleet Battles (the board game) in the 80's it was like a trip back to my sad, geeky youth. If it had been shipped in a better state or if a decent patch was available I'd have given it 3.5 stars.When it becomes a budget (10 quid) title then pick it up and have a go!"
1,A star trek maniac,Hardly worth my [money]! I thought it would be a great SFC game but I thought wrong. The first two SFC were spectacular but ORION PIRATES went wrong in everyway possible!
4,Orion Pirates,"A great game with more features than I was expecting. You don't have to play the pirates, you can join any other original empires in the game. There are dozens (hundreds?) of ships available so the game never gets dull - there is always something new to try."
3,brick of knowledge,"Highly informative, highly relatable, and highly dense. Today was the first day that I read out of this book without falling asleep-- I actually use this book when I have trouble sleeping. It isn't written in a very engaging way. Last year for AP European history I read every word of Jackson J. Spielvogel's Western Civilization (5th ed) but I just can't get through this book.The language isn't tough or anything like that, it just takes tons of time and motivation to get through it. My strategy is reading the related review section in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0768918243/ref=pd_sim_b_3/104-6362718-0022321?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v;=glance&n;=283155"">AP US history review book</a> and highlighting that down, and then attempting to skim this text.So in general, I'm mixed, but it's definitely boring for the most part."
4,My latest book.,"This book is not my first Shadow-run novel, and it'll not be my last, that much is sure. Great plot, cool way of telling the story in couple o'short stories, this book seems great, but the ending leaves a bad aftertaste in my Brain. Sure, nobody wants a totally happy ending in a Shadowrun book, that would'nt be right. But finishing this book makes me long for a sequel, probably because I'm a bit Lycantrophic myself, or because I really enjoyed this story around Wolf Kies and Lynn Ingold. Maybe the ending would've tasted better if SHE became a shadowrunner herself, but thats just he way it is...you still here? GO BUY THE DREADED BOOK ALREADY!"
5,A must for any fan of ShadowRun,"This book brings all of the fun and adventure of the previous books and games of ShadowRun together. The book is a series of adventures by the same characters similar to a role playing game itself. If you enjoy high adventure in a setting that the reader can believe and understand, then this book is for you."
1,Disappointing,"This was easily the most disappointing Shawdowrun ""novel"" I've read. In fact, it's not a novel, it's an anthology prettied up to look like a novel for purely commercial reasons. (The author admits as much in an Afterward).Because the chapters aren't really linked, the book is more of a collection of gaming scenarios than a novel. The thing I like about the Shadownrun books in general is that they build towards revealing some deep dark secret at the center of a conspiracy of powerful evil forces. You're trying to figure it out yourself the whole time, just like a good mystery. This book has none of that. The stories are mostly just minor mysteries that are easily solved by Wolf and Co. blowing up everyone who gets in their way. Those who are really into Shadowrun gaming might feel differently about this book, but I didn't care for it much at all."
2,Disappointing,"This is the worst Shadowrun novel by far. Buy it and read it only if you are a Shadowrun fanatic like myself. It really is not a novel, but a collection of short stories, which I think the author states were written for a magazine before the Shadowrun game was even made. Even so, the stories, except for the first one, are very corny and if you have read and enjoyed other Shadowrun novels in the past, you will be left with a very bad taste in your mouth when you finish reading this book."
1,Worst Shadowrun novel,"It seems to be a trend in Shadowrun books to make the main character nigh invincible and Wolf and Raven is one of the worst at this. This book does not focus on a single plot, but a collection of idiotic stories. Join Wolf, an irritating adept with the wolf spirit living in his head(? ) and his buddy Raven, a bodybuilding Elf mage(yeah,okay) as they play professional baseball, battle a boat and help little homeless kids. Or don't, and save yourself 6 bucks."
4,An early collection of columns,"Although definitely not as good as his later collections, this one is worth at least four stars. I would have given it 4 1/2 if it were possible on Amazon.com. Recommended, but if you're strapped for cash, I suggest purchasing a later work first, as you will probably enjoy it more. Also, the typeface (font) used in this edition is annoying, though quickly gotten used to."
3,good for what you pay,"I bought this to use on on my spare rod. It is a fair reel that costs very little...exactly what I wanted.Originally the reel was broken (the handle had snapped off in shipping), but, as usual, Amazon replaced it for me immediately. The replacement reel seemed to have better line on it...this was a surprise that it would not be exactly like the first one, but it worked to my advantage.The reel is a bit noisy and the drag is either on or off-no adjusting. But for the price it works just fine and it included line!"
4,God for the money,It is grate for the money! I got it to fllip fish for bass you need a soft touch and feel.
2,Capt. Dave,"The drag system sucks. Either NO drag or FULL drag. Also try to switch it from right bhand to left hand, EASY if you are a mechanic or engineer."
3,Not if you are just starting.,"I am just getting started composing/arranging on my computer using MIDI and this book was of very little value to me.It is intended as a course text book and will be of value to those who are more interested in the engineering, programming & other technical aspects of computer music.Contains lots of general technical information and appears to be written for those who have a fairly large studio at their disposal such as a audio/computer lab."
2,Misleading and inaduquate,"All of Stephen Hayes books have left me feeling disgusted and used, this book is no different. Documentation of technique is in aduquate, leaving many gaps and holes.The only Stephen Hayes book worth getting is ""the Ninja and their secret art"" which has 8 pages (out of 154) that covers very well the silent steping techniques...Mr. Hayes should write pamphlets instead of books."
1,A word of caution.,"While Steven K. Hayes likes to make many claims about himself and Ninjutsu, one should be warned that much of what he says about Ninjutsu is simply incorrect. And i dont believe i can stress the this point enough, that is that contrary to his claims in this and his other books he was far from being Hatsumi first foreign student, neither is he or will he ever be the ""Foremost Western Instructor"". When reading this book one must keep in mind that much of what Hayes says is in conflict with what Hatsumi has taught so just to take it with a grain of salt."
2,The Mystic Arts of the Ninja,"This book wasn't very good!! I'd much rather recommendyou take a look at some Ashida Kim books!! If you want to learn about true Ninjitsu tactics then check out Ashida Kim's books!! Ashida Kim really knows his stuff, that's why he'swritten over 12 books on the Ninja!! I'd check out ""Secrets of the Ninja"" or ""The Invisible Ninja"" both by Ashida Kim!!In those books you will learn about stealth, weaponry, history,sentry removal, espionage, rigorous training, and secret techniques of the Ninja!! Some of the Language is in Chinese, but incase you didn't know, Ninjitsu came from China!! They are probably the best books on Ninjitsu I've ever seen!! Who ever says he's a fake is full of it!! I've also seen some of his demonstrations where he does things that other styles would be scared to try out!! He really knows his stuff!! So forget Hayes and others, get books from Ashida Kim!! He really is a TRUE Ninjitsu MASTER!!"
2,No Phil.....Just doesn't sound right......,"I'm a big early L.A. Guns fan, and with that said, I just couldn't get used to this new Guns incarnation without Phil. The songs were ok, not great, and without Phil....naaahh.Buy any and all L.A. Guns with Phil Lewis on vocals, anything else and it really ain't worth it."
3,L.A. Guns meets Steel Panther,Bad news: Phil Lewis does NOT sing here.Good news: Singer is Rapph Sanchez aka Michael Star of STEEL PANTHER.
4,Pretty good stuff,"I did a bit of research before my purchase, and I believe I may have asked too much from the the product in an attempt to save money. I used the product where there was not adiquate space for the product to perform. I believe it requires 1 or 2 inches of space I just did not have the space so it is being tore up under my truck and I will be replacing it in a few weeks with a more apropriate and expensive product."
4,"Difficult to Install, but worth the price.","My wife complained about how cold the toilet seat was - so I bought her this & gave it to her for Christmas as a joke. WoW, the jokes I made up after I gave it to her! She refuses to tell her relatives I got her that for Xmas. Anyway, it requires a GFI outlet in the bathroom and the wire is short. So I installed a new plug by the toilet, which meant running a line from the switch in the closet. Took two 3-hour days to do it.The reason I give it 4 stars is that the replacement odor maker (they call a vent) are 3-in-a-box for $15.35. I bet they don't last long. I'm going to look for something to use that will be cheaper.Just finished installing it, but it works great and looks good. Within a second after sitting on it it is fully warm - instant satisfaction. There are 3 heat settings.The instructions say it only functions when the seat is occupied, but they have a ""Power Save Setting"" that turns off the electricty for six, 9 or 12 hours. I wonder why. . ."
3,hubby did not like...:-(,Thought this was a great idea for our old house but we don't really have electrical outlet close enough and it just did not work with extension cord = a good idea but not for us....
4,Good Product,"Have had this pannier for about a month or so. Works pretty well for my purposes. It's handy for most items. I carry my tennis racquet bag in it with no problem. It's well-built, and that it can fold up flat is a plus when it's not in use. For general purpose use, this item is a good buy. I'd like the mounting to be a bit more secure, but it's not a big problem."
1,"Hello, Sunlite... towns are bumpy! Very disappointing","Why can't these companies put sturdy pannier hardware on the simple bags? This design doesn't account for the bumps, grooves, hills, and quick-burst pedaling that comes with living in a town. Bag fell off more than once. Sad - a few dollars more design improvement, and the design would be first-rate. As it is, it is unsatisfactory. I returned it after a week of whole hearted effort to make it work. Needs more robust rack-fastener mechanism."
1,Don't even think of buying it!,"As others have already mentioned, the hooks are terrible (you don't even need a curb, or potholes, a slight change in your speed, or turning will guarantee the fall of the bag)... you could just as well simply put your grocery bag on top of your rack. Too bad that I ordered two of them... Otherwise the bag wouldn't be bad... if you planned on carrying it on your handlebar :) So take my advice, and stay away from Sunlite products in general. Now I have the Wald 582 wire basket. Doesn't look that fancy, but works perfectly, and no one would try to steal it :)"
4,Sunlite Grocery Getter Pannier Bicycle Bag,"Well made with lots of space, extra pockets for small stuff and a case for your phone that can be detached. The bag can be a bit bulky when filled but folds up nicely when not in use. I would recommend this product to a friend."
2,Does not hold onto rack,"2 stars for the material and the nice size. No stars at all for safety.It does not take very large bumps to come off the rack. As it does notfully close (no cover), on my first ride everything in the bag spilledonto a major 4-lane road when I hit a small bump. Not good."
1,PARTS MISSING AT DELIVERY,"I ordered my 418 last week and it got here in several days. However, as soon as I moved the heavy box inside and opened everything up, I had wrong screws, missing screws and washers, etc. Of course, it is not 9:45 p.m. and customer service is closed. I am very annoyed, to say the least."
5,Excellent Design & Quality,"First the negative stuff.....Amazon said we would receive the shipment on 12/27-12/29. Someone tried to deliver the machine on 12/23 but we weren't home. There was no prior notification nor did the driver leave a note. Finally we had to contact Amazon to find out where the shipment was. Now the positive. The item was very well-packed. It took my wife and I 3 hours to assemble it but that was with breaks. The instructions were adequate once you figured out which nuts, bolts, and screws to use. The assembly was pretty easy and the parts all fit well and were all there. The operation is smooth and quiet. From a fitness standpoint, you will get a good overall workout on this machine. The price $799 was a great deal and the shipping was only 1 cent. This is a practical piece of equipment--especially if the weather prevents you exercising outside."
5,Great Product!,"I received my 418 on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. I order a few days befor T-day, so that was fast. No notice before delivery and no one was home but they did call and re-deliver that afternoon. Driver also brought it into the entry of the house. I unboxed and took pieces one at a time upstairs. Took about 3 hours to assemble with breaks. Everything works great.When you have it put together right it is a quite workout. The only thing I'm sure about regarding accuracty is the heart rate. For a few workouts I checked my heart rate with the grips and a Polar strapped on me and they were the same. It does not read the Polar transmitter, though. I use the AC adapter only and have had no problems. I bought the excercise mat to go underneath it and I also bought the on-site service. I have no need for service yet. I also paid $799 then and $50 for shipping.LCD TV on the wall in front of the Eliptical made the whole setup great. Still using it!"
1,Awful Experience - Do Not Recommend,"We received this product for Christmas in 2005 and within two weeks the console broke. We contacted Schwinn immediately and was told we would receive a replacement console. It is now May 1st and the console we need is still on backorder --- 5 MONTHS!!!!! It is absolutely ridiciulous. I call each week and I get the same response.Unfortunately, we should have contacted Amazon within the 30 day period to get reconciliation from Amazon. Lesson learned there.The product when it was working was fine. But the pain since then is not worth it.I do not recommend this product."
1,BEWARE!!!!!,I loved the machine - until it broke. THERE'S NO FRIGGIN' TECHNICAL SUPPORT OR REPAIR OPTIONS from Schwinn. They don't care.
4,Arrived In Good Timing.,"Arrived in a huge box, i thought was going to take a long time for one person to put together, but actually took only 3hrs. Assembly was fairly easy, machine works great although I think the calories is off."
5,Best money I have spent recently.,"It took about 2 hours to assemble, but works great. Much quieter than a treadmill."
4,Look out god bod 2005,"I purchased this machine at costco ($699), thinkling it wouldn't be as good as the precor at the gym, but it would have to do as my scheule for working out is never the same.I absolutely love it.It's a real heavy box ( nearly 200 lbs) so you may want a friend around to help move the bloody thing. It requires assembly. My 14 year old daughter put it together so I imagine most people will manage.This is just as nice and effective as the precor we used at the gym; we have it at home in the living room as a reminder to take 30 minutes, watch a sit come and get our work out done.The stride is nice ( even for people with longer legs) and the programs have a variety of workouts for all levels of fitness.I would definately recommend this machine to anyone who is in love with the much more costly precor machine- or for anyone who wants to burn burn burn those calories"
5,The computer makes you feel good,"The good: It was simple to put together, and it runs smoothly. Before we made the purchase, we tried out a few models in a local bike shop and at the Dick's with prices ranging from $600 to $2500, and my 9 year old and I both liked the feel of the Schwinn 438 best. Once I confirmed that the mechanicals of 418 and 438 were the same, I put in the order.The not so good: The box did not include the advertised water bottle, and when I called the customer service of Schwinn, I was told that it was no longer included in the package; (...). When reading the feedback from the computer, it appears that the numbers are on the luxurious side: my 5 mile runs usually take 47-49 min, but on the 418 I logged nearly 6 miles over the same time span, yet did not feel as challenged. Also, the distance meter will chop off 0.1 after your first step on the machine. I am also skeptical of the calories it reports."
3,Good but feels a little rickety...,"I have been using the Schwinn 418 ellipical trainer on and off for about a year now, and I have been relatively pleased. When buying this, you have to consider the relatively low price you are paying for an exercise machine.That being said, I believe that the calories burned counter is off by over a factor of 2x. Further, some protective parts don't fit due to the the fact that the screws sent were too big for the holes.Ultimately, it is a relatively inexpensive trainer, and I believe that I got what I paid for..."
3,good buy but some warts,"I have used my 428 almost daily for 3 years and the motor eventually died. Customer support was efficient and friendly, but shipping was very slow. With the new motor in the resistance levels are all much harder. A workout that was at R13 feels the same as R9 with the new part. I think claims that the calorie counts are greatly inflated are true. I still love the workout, but weight watchers beware, you aren't earning as many points as you may think!"
5,Campbell Soup book,Precious book. Shipped quickly and in good condition. I was very pleased with my purchase and I would buy from this Seller again. Thanks!!
3,Tedious but I liked it!,"This book got off to a veeery slow start for me. The paragraphs and paragraphs of ""scene setting"" made me want to skim through them to get to the heart of the matter. If you like the scene setting style, Cramer indeed does a very good job of it!The story line is compelling and Mr. Cramer weaves a ""good triumphs over the evil"" theme throughout the book supported by a light dusting of Christian biblical references and experiences. He weaves this into the storyline without overwhelming you with it.Whereas the book held my attention, some of the story was a bit unbelievable. I was glad when I was finished with the book but mostly because of the ""scene setting"" slowness of it."
5,In My Top Five for 2004,"Cramer is a wonderful writer. In this, my first taste of his prose, I discovered bitter sorrow, sweet redemption, and tidbits of wisdom with dashes of humor.""Bad Ground"" begins with an orphaned teenager named Jeremy. He has his share of scars, but he holds onto an innocent faith in God. This faith is tried and tested when he ends up living and working with his uncle Aiden. Aiden, otherwise known as Snake, leads a crew of miners outside of Atlanta. He's a morose man laboring under guilt and physical deformities.Cramer fills his story with memorable characters, believable dialogue, and situations that defy description in this review. I was laughing out loud at points, wiping a tear from my eye at others.Like ""The Secret Life of Bees"" or ""Gap Creek,"" this story contains many riches wrapped around spiritual themes. Written with grace, ""Bad Ground"" demands to be read by the masses."
4,Late-1980s Brazilian samba-pop,"This is an album by Brazilian samba-pop/MPB artist Joao Bosco, originally out in 1989, on the Sony-Epic label.

4,Colin McRae Rally 2005,"This is the most amazing game! If only I had received the information that should have come with it. My general impression is this is a bootleg copy, while a well done one. The DVD case came shrinkwrapped. However, when I opened it, there was no booklet of information at how to set-up/play this very elaborate game. The DVD has also had some issues, and the game does not run properly. When I tried to download updates for the game, it was shut down entirely(sensing a bootleg?) and I had to uninstall and reinstall the game to get it working. The result? I highly reccomend this game, but make sure you are buying from a source that is selling a true new copy, with all of the information that should accompany it."
4,Wine rack review,"The rack arrived within two or three days, was easy to put together quickly, and holds a lot of bottles."
3,No room for the bubbly !?!,"If you want to store 44 bottles of wine, (or 1 liter soda bottles), in a no frills structure, this will do nicely..A few pieces of the unfinished pine had knots or other cosmetic blemishes. But it screws together quickly. The real shock is that the cubbies are so small, ONLY standard diameter wine bottles will fit. Sparkiling wine/champagne bottles are too wide, & need to be jammed in. It won't accomodate 2 liter bottles either. Otherwise, it's sturdy & light weight; good for a rustic wine cellar or closet, not on display in the dining room."
3,wood is a bit soft,"Overall assembly is very easy and this does fit my immediate purpose.The pine wood used is quite soft though and I am concerned that over time the softness will deform the wiine cavities a bit.Also, the unit needs to be balanced vertically becuase it can tend to shift/sway slightly.Two things that would improve this product would be to use a bit harder wood and add cross stays on the back side to prevent racking."
4,Easily put together,"After a little sanding and tedious painting, this wine rack was easily assembled. It would be better if not so rough and full of splinters! It did the job though."
1,cheap,"Very cheaply made. I thought it would be nicer and fit larger bottles of wine. I had to stain it and it looks ok, but made very badly."
5,Nice and inexpensive,"These wine racks are a little gem. I don't have a fancy cellar, I've got a cool room in my basement. I added a light, some paint and some old tile to the floor, but building a wine rack wasn't in the cards and buying an expensive one wasn't either. I bought two of these, they went together easily (less than 5 minutes) with a cordless screwdriver. Now I've got storage for 88 bottles. Nice.One comment made by other reviewers is that large bottles won't fit. My largest bottle is a white Burgundy, Chassagne-Montrachet, and it fit just fine. I image that large thick bottles such as a sparkling wine or an overly accentuated Burgundy styled bottle wouldn't fit.I'm very happy with my wine rack."
1,Poor Performance,"I ordered this wooden wine rack on January 6, it arrived all woods cracked and broken. I am still waiting for a refund. I will post pictures of this broken product tomorrow."
3,Easy to assemble. Useful size.,"This rack is very easy to assemble. (If you have a good electric screwdriver, or drill with screwdriver bits.) You should be quite aware that it is cheap, unfinished wood, and it will NOT be a piece of furniture that you'll want to display to you wine buddies. Mine is under the stairs in my basement. It's easy to get to the wine, and pretty much out of the way.There is one important point you should be aware of. The spaces for each bottle of wine are designed for you typical 750ml bottle, and are separated from the other bottles by small wooden spacers. They are not in what you'd consider separate compartments. I placed a bottle that was somewhat wider than normal in the rack, and when I removed it, it dragged the bottle underneath it out as well, which smashed on the floor.If you use this rack with any odd shaped bottles, be very careful inserting them, and removing them. This rack will definitely not hold 1.5 liter bottles, or any of my Chamoagne bottles."
3,ok but...,A good solid starter rack. The only problem is it only fits straight bottles. If you are a Pinot Noir drinker this is not the rack for you. Easy to put together. Price is right.
4,Tight Wooden Wine Rack,Fat bottles won't fit and no back so put it up against a wall or just be careful. Otherwise good deal for the money; less then $2 a bottle.
4,good basic wine rack,"Very easy assembly, and very sturdy. Only downside is that it only holds standard bottles. I have some whites in slightly wider bottles (similar to champagne bottles) and they don't fit. Also, be aware that you really can't use it horizontally, which was my original intention. Otherwise, I would certainly recommend this rack - a good value for the price."
2,wine rack review,"Definitely a CHEAP wine rack. Putting it together, I found that one piece was cracked all the way through. Also, most of the wood was pretty warped, so that when half of it was put together, it was totally off balance and not level at all. Even when it was fully put together (difficult considering the warping and the cracked piece) it was still not level. Too bad because it really looks pretty in the picture. Do not buy this if you want something nice and sturdy!"
1,Poor Quality,"My husband bought this for me as a gift. When I opened the box to assemble it, many of the pieces had cracks and fractures. While I know it is unfinished pine, many of the slats were full of knots and of uneven size. The pieces to hold the five columns together were cut off size and off center, as well as unsanded, very rough and full of splinters, so the rack could never be assembled in a manner in which the bars would be straight, not to mention many of the bars not lining up evenly within the columns. Needless to say, I am having him return it, as it is useless as it arrived to us, and unable to be properly assembled. When he contacted seller, they offered to send replacement parts, but as many things as are wrong with it, they would have had to replace the whole thing! Would not recommend."
2,Low quality but does the job,"If all you need is a wine rack to tuck away in a dark corner somewhere than this should do. However, the wood is low quality pine - furring strip equivalent. Mine came with a couple of splits at the screws and if you want to finish it off be prepared for some splinters unless you do so a good deal of prep work. Even then it doesn't take a stain very well. The picture is better than the actual rack."
3,Good basic rack but it can't hold larger bottles,"This is a good and solid (though very basic) wine rack. It's perfect for a simple cellar like ours in a basement closet. Our only concern is that we tend to buy red wines, and many of the bottles of the Pinor Noir we like, do not fit in this rack. Those bottles are simply too wide to fit. Otherwise we're happy with this product."
3,cheezy,I bought this for my father in law for Christmas and when I went to his house a few months later he had it put together and I was emabarrassed to see the quality of the product. It looks flimsy and cheap. It wasn't cheap. That's the problem. I sure hope it holds all his bottles of wine safely. Disappointed. I guess I should have known better. It's made of pine which is a very soft wood.
4,Great for storage,My husband and I are very pleased with the rack. It was easy to put together and is quite sturdy. A good choice for beginning wine collectors.
4,worth the money,Good buy for the money - acceptable quality. Very easy to assemble and to stain (but stain before putting the rack together).Good fit for all regular bottels of red and white wine.
4,Satisfied Customer,"Was delighted with the wine rack, easy to put together and being unfinished gave the option to stain or paint a color choice. I optioned for clear varnish. Would recommend or order another one."
4,Assemble with care,Great bargain. I suggest using only hand tools to assemble because the wood is basic pine. Do not over tighten! I had to sand the grooves on two pieces to fit properly. The rack is perfect for our little wine closet/cellar.
5,Loven my wine rack,This rack is easy to assemble and very easy to install. The price is right and I will be purchasing more as I continue to build my wine collection.
4,Good for what it is,"The wine rack arrived quickly and was very easy to assemble. I am using it in a storage area of a garage so the fact that it is unfinished doesn't matter to me. If you are using it as a decorative piece in a living area, it would not be very attractive."
2,Wine rack,"The item arrived quickly. After putting it together I realized it is not very well made, but for the money I suppose it is functional."
5,Excellent Book!,"This is an excellent book! I liked it better than the first one because of the humor; all the crazy conversations the crew has, Lombardo's songs, and Nigel's belief in the Yeti. Some other things I liked about it were: the crew and Captain Barth get bigger parts in this one than in Journey to the Pole, Kosta learns to walk without his toes, and Nigel and Philip both reform and end up being pretty nice poeple. I think everyone should read this book, even if they're older than the suggested age range."
2,I really didn't think this product worked well ...,"I really didn't think this product worked well at all. I usually like Finesse products, but as a shampoo and conditioner combined, I really found it lacking. I couldn't comb through my hair at all, and I had to end up using a separate conditioner anyway. I did like the scent, and it worked fine as a shampoo, but I don't see at all where this should in any way condition your hair. I have shoulder length hair that's pretty healthy, so it isn't as if it just didn't work for me since my hair is so dry and dead or whatever. I wouldn't buy this product, nor would I recommend it to anyone."
3,Finesse Shampoo Plus Conditioner for Normal Hair worked ...,Finesse Shampoo Plus Conditioner for Normal Hair worked well. It lathered nicely. The smell was pleasant. It left my hair feeling soft and looking clean. It seemed to be an average product. It didn't seem to be significantly better or worse than similar products. I'd recommend this product if the price was less than that of another brand.
4,Good Reference Work,"This is a must-have reference book that is of great use to the jazz aficionado. It does have one glaring flaw, though -- not enough coverage of bossa nova and jazz influenced by Brazilian music (think of the hundreds of jazz interpretations of Jobim's compositions). For that I would recommend ""The Brazilian Sound,"" which includes 1,000 titles in its discography."
4,Read the Books!,"I rented this movie with some others because sounded different than martial arts and robots. I didn't know there was such a thing as ""yaoi"". Admittedly, the story was kind of lame, but I really enjoyed the characters! They seemed well formed, as though they had been snatched out of the middle of a series, so I looked into FAKE and Anime Turnpike. As luck would have it, the first volume of the manga was just being released by Tokyo Pop!I highly recommend the manga for this anime. The artwork far outshines the OAV, and the characters are wonderfully funny and real. The OAV really doesn't do Dee and Ryo justice (if fact they look a bit dispropotioned).Read the books! They'll become your favorite!"
4,Superb gay anime.,"FAKE is a stunning project. The movie presented is actually a bit of a compression of the SECOND issue of a manga (Japanese comic) of the same title. Although the movie attempts to show all pertinant background information of the characters involved, it leaves out some details. In all, however, it is an excellent movie, and quite a daring import, given the american attitude about homosexuality."
3,"shake it buddy, dance, dance, dance","Okay, this movie's deffinetly not gona win an award for best animation though it should win best song, just for the whole ""Shake it buddy"" thing. The story's really fun and fresh to any long time otaku lookin for somthin out of the ordinary. Though it's far too short, if it was only a few minutes longer I think the story would of done better. The movie does credit to the gay community staying away from the sterotypical flamers talking in lisps and acting... well like queens. Although its mostly slap stick comedy when the movie wants to be serious it gets its point across, thats the first time i've ever seen Peter Rabbit get impailed with a butcher knife. A word of advice if you're not familar with the manga series that spawned this movie don't pay much attention to the opening, it'll just confuse you."
3,Fake - no. Bizarre - yes!,"Perhaps the strangest ""cartoon"" I have ever seen. I find Japanese films pretty odd at the best of times but this is quite simply one that has to be seen to be believed. However that is a recommendation.The two main characters actually work quite well and apart from the face explosions (the catoonist can't seem to draw feelings very well) it's not that bad!This is certainly not for main stream viewing but at the same time is not offensive. It's apparently known as ""Yaoi"" so look it up before you buy or check the other reviews.Summary: Unique."
2,What a disappointment!,"So many people were raving over this movie that I bought it. the animation is fair at best, the script is more laughable than funny. Two of my friends walked out when we watched it. The main storyline, that of the murder mystery, is very underdeveloped, the relationship of the main characters is flirted with, but never really explored much.I base a lot of my anime purchases, and gay theme purchases in general, on reviews of fans and critics alike. I had much higher hopes for FAKE. What a waste."
2,Dissapointing,"My review may be harsh, but I'm a little demanding about my likes.For those content with BL in any form, FAKE may be a reasonable buy. However, if you require plot, beauty, and originality, don't bother with this DVD. I would recommend you to try the book version, since, from what I've seen, it is considered superior to the anime, although that shouldn't be too difficult.The plot is a weak frame to Ryo and Dee's non-existant relationship. There seems not to be any reason for Ryo's hesitation toward Dee's advances, other than the fact than the author may think that with the consumation of their relationship the audience may become uninterested in the whole baseless story.Mediocre drawings, mediocre plot, mediocre characters.I gave it 2 stars out of the kindness of my heart, but don't even bother."
3,Doesn't Live Up to the Manga =(,"The manga was a much more vivid portrayal of emotion; everything was just so bland and while it was comedial at the same time it was just so boring. With only an hour to introduce everything while in reality and in flashbacks, it leaves the watchers in suspense - what happened before they actually came to England for the vacation? What happened after Lieutenant Berkeley Rose was made Commish of the 27th NY precint? It just doesn't live up to the manga. But... if you're up for a laugh, give this one a shot!"
4,fake,"Fake is a mix of the manga but still is very good. It feels like there should be more to the store and leaves you hanging, I can't wait until the next movie comes out."
4,A warm hearted shonan-ai anime that did not quite live up the manga,"This is truly sweet shonan-ai anime. In New York City, Dee Laytner is a tough cop that does not have a problem expressing his feelings. His partner, Randy (Ryo) MacClean, is an introverted guy who is confused about Dee's feelings towards him, as well as his own feelings towards Dee. When these two decide to go on vacation together in the English countryside, Dee thinks its a great time to put the movies on his pouty partner. But their weekend is interupted by a serial killer out to get anyone who is Japanese."
2,Not As Good As The Books,"I didn't expect this movie to be as good as the book, and sadly I was right. It was difficult for me to enjoy the movie due to all the repeated yelling and over reacting going on. The animation itself stays very true to the books surpirsingly, which was nice. The story also stays very true to the books. If I were to recommend some Yaoi that I thought was a better movie, I'd have to recommend Kizuna... much, much better."
3,Not up to the standard of the books,"Its an okay yaoi manga, but the books are so much better. Its really a shame that they have shortend the story down to only 60 min. and cencured many of the good moments from the book.If you are very interested in the yaoi cartoons I would recommend you buy the books insted and if you absolutly want a yaoi cartoon buy Kizuna insted it is so much better."
2,Read the manga!,"Dude, I watched the anime and cringed. It looked like Ryo was being harassed by Dee. It was really sad because it looked like Ryo wasn't interested at all. In the manga, it's very different. It's clear from early on that Ryo *is* interested in Dee, even though Ryo is unwilling to admit to it ... much. I mean, the manga is absolutely spectacular, chock-full of plot and fun, realistic characterizations. The anime is just ... well, mediocre at best. Seriously, if you want strong, capable cops who are handsome and male and ... have a thing for each other, then go read the manga! Go!!"
4,A Crooked Comedy,I found this story very amusing. I have never read the manga based on this story but the plot was still easily understandable. I found the anime clever and its staying in my collection for good. The DVD doesn't have any interesting extra's besides dialoge switching. Nothings perfect.
2,As Fake As A Sitcom,"There is an implausible script and unanswered questions and an ending that's so convenient it leaves you emotionally removed -- much like a sitcom. Why is Ryo so ambiguous about his feelings for Dee? Is he a role model for frustrated gay Japanese youth who cannot be emotionally honest and decisive with anyone, especially themselves? Maybe I'm asking for too much, and maybe this was for younger audiences. This show offers a lot of colourful animation, the occasional humour, a graphic murder plot (not really suitable for younger audiences, eh?), and no shounen-ai (just a couple semi-romantic kisses). On the political bright-side, it has a positive representation of homosexuals (they are not the enemies) who are respected as normal people (Dee's antics and Ryo's ineptness aside) by the people around them."
4,Wear it backwards,"Wonder who the idiot was who put the ""nice pair"" on the BACK of the shirt. That's just WRONG."
3,"Entertaining, but ultimately disappointing",This is a good not excellent book. I would rather call it a filmography than a biography. Galbraith spends much to much time on critics re-hashed reviews and incomplete and sometimes inaccurate facts that do nothing but leave the reader wondering. One comes away with the feeling that perhaps Galbraith does not particularily like either of these two great men. Most of the positive comments on Mifune and Kurosawa come from other people. Galbraith seems to take pleasure in pointing out each mans short comings and skimming over their accomplishments. His writing style is rather plebian and I wonder if perhaps he got in over his head with this book. Hopefully someone will write a true biography on both these great men one day. I for one cannot wait! These two luminaries deserve much better!
3,A good introduction,"I would go along with the other reviewers on this one. This book, while good, does not do enough delving into the lives of these two men, their work habits or the forces around them. It only skims those, which is interesting since this book is about 650 pages long. It also gives no illumination on the central question of why Mifune and Kurosawa did not work together again after ""Red Beard."" Still, for the person wanting an introduction, this is a well-written, ably done book."
5,Identity Theft,"The item was fine, but as a result of this purchase my identity was stolen and used for computer games. I have identity theft protection, so it did no damage to me. Now I have to get a new card."
4,"jump on it , son!","had to find this used. when amazon says 4 to 6 weeks i don't know what that means (usually not a good sign of ultimate availability), but glad i got it! a couple of pieces they intentionally make a little jumpy looking, i think to go along with the lanois-type treatment of those 2 songs (eg, deeper well), but all in all a great concert with good camera angles and what a band! as tony rice would say, JUMP ON IT SON!"
5,SPYBOY DVD,"If my house burns down and I get out alive,I'm going back in for this one...this is my favorite Emmylou period,and contains material from Wrecking Ball. This disc led me to discover Buddy Miller. I cannot understand why this disc was discontinued.I found mine in the nineties in a Calgary Alberta HMV,and regret leaving Calgary without buying the other disc they had as a back up.Julie Miller appears to sing All My Tears with Emmylou,and that alone is worth the price,about $19.99 Cdn,at the time,though see it advertised on Amazon at over a hundred these days."
1,How Disappointing!,"As a long, long, long time fan of Emmylou Harris, I was thrilled to learn a live performance of hers was available on DVD. However, the sound quality is terrible and the song selections are uninspiring. After watching the DVD once, I have no desire to see it again, and I regret very much having spent the money for it."
2,A couple problems,"First off, I also get ""time drift"". Not always a bad thing as I seem to need an extra 10 minutes, but at the moment the clock is about 40 minutes fast. A pain to keep resetting. Also, only has one alarm so I have to keep resetting depending on what the next day is. Lastly, I returned my first one because the volume control doesn't work for the alarm nature sounds (which are loud!), only for the sleep sounds. Turns out that's the way it works. But good nature sounds. ""Coulda been a champ""."
3,Interesting...,"I thought this book would help me out a lot, but found most of the items listed are very hard to find. I'm enjoying the info it is providing, but it hasn't been too helpful in treating any conditions I, or my family might have."
2,This book is much to watered down.,"Herbal Healing Secrets of the Orient unfortunately does a great injustice to the public. It appears that the author has greatly underestimated the level of intelligence of Jon Q. Public. The result is that readers come away with a overly simplified view of what traditional Chinese medicine is, does, how it functions in relation to present day medicine, and so on. I write this as both a critical reader and an acupuncturist/herbalist. My suggestion is that readers purchase The Web That Has No Weaver, by Kaptchuk. IT is informative, intriguing, and a classic."
1,Wrong Book,"The book ordered was not the same book sent. The book had the same title, different authors and totally different ISBN numbers. The book received was a 40 year old library book. After contacting them they did say keep the book and issued a refund for purchase price. But, in the time it took to wait for the book I couldn't find anything cheaper than the local bookstore and purchased there."
4,ford probe repair manual,The book is what one would expect for a used manual. I like it and save 50% from buying new
4,Ten Offenses?,"Really, it's the Ten Commandments that are the subject of this book. 700 Club host Pat Robertson offers a history of the movement to remove the Decalogue, as well as anything that has to do with God or the Bible, from courthouses, schools, and public life.Robertson focuses in on the recent case of Alabama Supreme Court Judge Roy Moore, who defiantly disobeyed a court order to remove a monument from the Ala. Supreme Court Building, and eventually was removed from the court.Finally, Robertson focuses on each of the Ten Commandments, their meaning and relevance for each of us, and practical ways for each of us to get involved in defending the Ten Commandments and becoming more active in civic responsiblilty.I highly recommend this book."
1,"How about ""Thou shalt not ASSASSINATE (murder)""???","I haven't read this book. Don't plan on reading ANY of Pat's books. ESPECIALLY after his comment last night (8/22/05) calling for the assassination of the president of Venezuela! No wonder people hate us Christians so much!!!I am a Christian, and I STRONGLY object to what Mr. Robertson said! That was a COMPLETELY Un-Christian thing to say!In Matthew 5:44-45, Jesus says: ""But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven...""Apparently, Mr. Robertson needs to brush up on his Biblical studies... Last night, he sounded more like a student of Al-Qiaeda. On behalf of good, non-hypocritical Christians, I denounce, and apologize for Pat Robertson's un-Christ-like behavior. It was truly outrageous."
1,UnChristian-like,"I am so glad that Christians around the world have such a good leader (sarcasm). Mr. Robertson is obviously off his meds. Let's see, assassinate the leader of Venezuala and the Israeli Prime Minister is being punished by God which is why he had a stroke. This is obviously a sign that Jesus left Mr. Robertson in charge. But then again, at least Pat has yet to see a 50 foot tall Jesus in Tulsa, OK. God has a way of reconciling those who manipulate his words ... see Jim Baker and Jessica Hahn. When the Lord comes knocking at your door Pat, how are you going to explain yourself. I hope you have not hired Tom Cruise's publicist."
1,Junk,There were scratches in the metal and slight specks of rust. The wood handle broke after only a few uses. A complete waste of $25.
5,It Works!,"I've read Lisa's book a few times now. With my child, I've learned that traditional methods of correction don't usually work. When I start stuggling for something new, I return to Lisa's book. Helps every time."
1,"better titled ""How to Terrorize and Demoralize Your Kids""","Lisa Whelchel's Creative Correction is a terrorist's handbook for legalistic parents who are missing the boat on what God truly intended. Anyone spending that much time dreaming up ways to make children miserable is certainly missing out on a lot of opportunities for true JOY. It is loaded with devious and cruel suggestions for tormenting children and must appeal particularly to those bent on absolutely controlling small people. Children are a gift from God that we should appreciate and be thankful for every moment. Money would be better spent on anything by Dr William Sears,""Jesus on Parenting"" by Dr Theresa Whitehurst, or Parenting with Grace by Dr Gregory Popcak. PLEASE don't take Whelchel's advise and hurt your little ones! The damage of this type of parenting leaves long lasting scars and you will ultimately suffer with them for your mistakes. Melissa King, Attachement Parenting International of Upper Montgomery County Maryland"
1,Sadistic Wickedness,"This is an incredibly wicked book. It amazes me that anyone could advise treating children with such cruelty. The Whelchel has no qualifications at all and it goes without saying that it goes against everything that modern science tells us leads to happy, healthy, obedient children. If you want your children to grow up to be violent misfits with no empathy, go ahead and buy this book."
1,So sad,"It appears that my previous post along with many other negatives were removed because the rating was much lower... I personally am a mother of three and a national certified counselor that has counseled numerous children and their parents. I would never advocate using this book. Lisa Whelchel is not a child development expert and she really just offers advice on how to torture children. I can imagine what her children and their friends think of her. Please think twice before purchasing this book. Instead goto your local library and and flip through it, particulary the 140's thru 150's. This book is very belittling to children. :("
1,Negative and disrespectful ideas,"I counsel new parents and try to review all the parenting books I can get my hands on, so I know what's available. I would definitely *not* recommend this one. Children need to be allowed to listen to their own internal controls, not forcefully controlled by their parents through punishment. The child's thoughts and feelings must always be considered. Many of the techniques in this book border on abuse. I'm particularly concerned about the ones Lisa suggests using in privacy, so no ""misunderstanding"" onlooker will report you to authorities. Parents would be better advised to read _Parent Effectiveness Training_ or anything by William Sears or La Leche League International."
1,judge for yourself--is this good parenting practice?,"p.139 ""Administering real correction--punishing a child when she has disobeyed--has to hurt a little to be effective, but that doesn't mean it has to be boring.""p.208 ""Got any old hand or ankle weights in the garage? Have your child wear them around his ankles or carry them around for the day as punishmentp.203 ""Use a pair of toy handcuffs to join two siblings who can't seem to get along. It's really fun to watch them try to eat dinner like this, or read a book, or take the garbage out, tasks I'll often assign them.""p.207 ""If they are unable to cooperate with one another, they must play in the backyard, whether it's 30 degrees or 100 degrees outside.""p.75 Whelchel approves of filling a boy's room with manure!p.138 ""My favorite curve, however, is to say no to some reasonable request, like `May I go to the bathroom?'""IS THIS REALLY CONSIDERED GOOD PARENTING ADVICE?TO ME IT IS SIMPLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY UNFIT."
1,"A horrifying piece of neo-nazi ""literature""","This woman is insane, and all throughout this book she describes accounts of child abuse as if there's nothing wrong with it. There's nothing Christian about this, it's disgusting and should be reason enough to put her in jail. Never in my life have I been so utterly repulsed by a book until now. This woman deserves to have her poor children taken away and she herself needs to go to prison, and the same applies to anyone who agrees with her methods and has the nerve to call themselves a responsible parent."
1,Please don't buy this book!!!,"Lisa Welchel's book is a sanctimonious collection of reactionary, disproven parenting techniques. Many of her methods are abusive. The book is an insult to good parents everywhere. Her approach resembles Marine Corps boot camp in some ways too.Lisa needs to reasess whether Jesus would treat children her way.Highly doubtful."
3,Some Great Ideas but be aware.....,"I actually enjoyed the creative ideas for rewards. Children should learn to EARN. We adults earn our paychecks, and children need to be taught not everything is handed to them forever. She offers great ideas. I do not agree with the Bible as an instrument of discipline. I think this will only encourage children to resent the Bible, a love letter from our savior. Teach principles without a hell-fire and brimstone approach."
4,Helps you think through what works for YOU,"Being a mother of two young children I read everything I can on becoming a better parent. What I liked about Lisa's book is that she gets the parent thinking of multiple ways to handle various situations. Bottom line is all our kids are different. What compels one to obey doesn't always work on another. AND some discipline that is very beneficial for one child may be rather abusive to another based on their personality. It takes love, discernment and willingness to be consistent so your kids know you mean what you say. Bottom line, not all of her creative correction suggestions will work for you. Don't follow this or any parenting book religiously. However, it is definately worth buying and reading over and over--it has helped both me and my sister (who has middle school kids) be more effective with getting our kids to listen and obey--hurray! Thanks Lisa."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book with practical ideas. My kids aren't typical ""cookie cutter"" children, so time-outs & spankings don't work well. I highly recommend this book!"
1,Worse than a waste of time,"I did not enjoy this book at all and found it disturbing to read parenting advice that, in my opinion, supports the worst of parental instincts, rather than helping parents learn to support their children and build a strong and trusting relationship. The author admits that her techniques didn't even work on her own son and has a chapter about what to do in that case.There are many better books out there that support parents in living more joyful and harmonious lives with their children while helping children learn and grow. The approach of this book is meanspirited. By ""creative corrections"" the author seems to mean coming up with creative ways to hurt or shame her children."
1,Startling,This book is a disgrace to parenting. The author needs psychological help and is a nutcase.
1,Abusive techniques,"Yet again, Amazon pulled a negative review. I HAVE READ this book, and the BOOK is filled with ABUSIVE techniques. Apparently, someone associated with the author is trying to skew the reviews positively. I am not attacking the author--she may be delusional or she may simply be wanting to help others. The TECHNIQUES (which Amazon say must be critiqued alone) are abusive and horrible. READ this book, and then add your own review. It is offensive to any human being who care about young children."
4,Good ideas,Haven't read the entire book yet. I flipped through to a chapter I was having questions with and used some of the ideas! Good advice and helps you keep things interesting!
3,SOME creative ideas,"I have to say that I did find a few very different ideas from this book that I will be using. HOWEVER, this book is VERY religious and therefore deals with ""spare the rod"" quite frequently. I DO NOT agree with the spanking, hot sauce on the tongue and other demeaning punishments."
4,"This book will help you raise responsible, loving children",I am SHOCKED to see all the negative reviews on this book. Many of my friends and I LOVE this book. It is full of really creative ideas that will help you think out of the box on parenting. She has many positive ways to reinforce positive behaviours while not allowing the negative ones to continue.
1,Horrible book,"I would give this book 0 stars if it were possible. This book is full of ideas on how to abuse your children physically and psychologically. At one point in the book, Lisa advises not to spank your child in public because someone might call child protective services on you. If it's something you can't do in public then it shouldn't be done. Perhaps she should have titled the book ""Creative Abuse"". It's a pity someone like this can get an audience for her horrible advice, simply because she used to be a television star, and that she misuses scripture to justify it. Then again, people have misused scripture to justify all kinds of evil."
1,Advocates abusive punishments,"While she may mean well, and she probably loves her children, many of the punishments she recommends are better described as emotional and physical abuse. I was reminded more of techniques used by torturers than of loving parents.If you have reached the point where you feel that these ""punishments"" are the only things that will work, I suggest you try family counseling before causing irrevocable damage to your child."
1,Reading This Reminded Me Of My Abusive Childhood,"I'm 47 and feel the sting in my heart when I see these methods are still being advocated and used to bring up children as I was: humiliation, control, confusion, mind games, disrespect. Yes, it crushed my spirit! It really screws you up when one or another of your parents is constantly ragging on everything you do as if their main pleasure in life is watching you be miserable, all in the name of correction and discipline. You doubt everything about yourself, is anything real? And then using the Lord as your justification...I've managed to raise two lovely, upright, intelligent and productive daughters to adulthood by willingly breaking the cycle of emotional, physical, mental and spiritual abuse in my family that Welchel describes so vividly. You don't need Welchel's or anyone else's opinions; go straight to the source and read the Bible for yourself."
1,If You Love Your Kid Stay Away From This Book,"As a mom that's just getting into my daughter's toddlerhood, I am appalled that a book like this is getting the attention it is. The suggestions she makes for keeping your kids in line are not only mean they are abusive. The point of disipline is to teach your child right from wrong - not to humiliate them. All that will do is kill their spirit and make them insecure and unable to cope. Ms. Welchel comes across as sadistic in that she suggests getting out a video camera to record the fun results of one of her more severe punishments. It all kind of reminds me of EST that thing from the 70's where they would tear down your personality by not letting you have water or go to the bathroom. That group was outlawed and I think this book should be too."
5,"finally, some great ideas for loving correction","There's so many great ideas for loving correction for your children. You can implement the ideas you like and toss anything you don't care to try just as the author says. I've found many creative ideas in this book to help us correct our boys lovingly and responsibly. I have also tossed a few ideas. Overall, this is a wonderfully written book to help parents raise sweet, well-behaved children."
4,Raising Children With Christian Values,"As the mother of two school-age children myself, ages 5 and 7, Lisa Whelchel Cauble's book is quite a find! It contains many ideas on how to handle everyday problems that arise when you're trying to raise children with Christian values. Lisa, an actress who now homeschools her 3 children, shares stories, mostly from the Cauble household, that I chuckled over while reading (as many similar situations have occurred in our household, too.) She offers creative suggestions on handling behavioral problems that are bound to arise (perhaps even on a daily basis!) like lying, not doing chores, disobedience, arguing with siblings and that ever-favorite-in-our-household: whining, just to name a few. The suggestions are interspersed with humor that is very much appreciated! Here's hoping Lisa write another book in a few years that covers the teenage years!"
3,Cute -- not applicable.,I enjoyed the book for it's humor. However many ideas are not useful and a teacher in FL was arrested or using one of the ideas. I did find I throughly enjoyed all of the books written by Michael & Debbie Pear as well as their teaching on Romans.Ruthie.
4,Parenting facts101,"When you are just about to pull out your last hair this book comes to the rescue... I enjoyed the real life advise, as well as the antidotes Lisa shares. She reminds you parenting is not an ""exact"" sport. You realistically can't use all the ideas but you can pick and choose what works in your lifestyle and then get a good chuckle from some of the others. After,I can re-group and start again. No easy task with 3 toddlers under 5. I look for all the ""creative ideas"" I can find and Lisa gives some winners with real life Christian values as a bonus! Thank you Lisa and all those that shared along with you."
3,After filtering through all the religious filler...,"This is a good book on child-rearing. However, it must be said as a warning that this is a VERY religious author, and therefore a VERY religious book. I am not religious, and was surprised to find so much reference to God and to Jesus! I read this book much quicker then I would have originally anticipated due to the extreme and frequent nature of all the bible-speak. At the heart of this book are still some fantastic ideas, even for the non-religious person like myself. I would recommend buying this book, but be prepared to skim it quite a bit!"
4,Alternatives in extreme situations...,"I also am an RN who specializes in pediatric intensive care... I DO NOT agree with the former reviews though that speak of abuse.... Until someone has had to correct children with severe behavior problems then using such alternative means might be extreme, however sometimes extreme behavior calls for extreme measures... and as for hot sauce and the previous RN's opinon...please... it's a small amount not the whole bottle...Some ""people"" have to blow everything out of proportion... I personally haven't had to use any of discipline measures listed myself, but I have known several parents who have and they have gotten excellent results..."
1,It has nothing to do with creative & everything to do with abuse,"Putting hot sauce on your child's tongue? I bet the author wouldn't ever dare to do that to herself & look at all the hate spewing out of her mouth. As a born-again believer & mother, I'd never follow anything in this book. It's so unchristlike that it's sickening. There's nothing ""creative"" about her correction ideas - it's just plain mean & a newer version of old abuse tactics that our parents used to do.We can do better than this."
2,"Some good, but a whole lot of bad","I don't spank, personally, but I was spanked as a child and I don't think it damaged me a bit. To each his own. I checked this book out from the library after hearing all the press about it, and while I don't think I'd call Lisa Welchel a child abuser, I sure wouldn't want her raising my kids.How is giving arbitrary orders (like refusing to let a kid go to the bathroom, just to assert your authority) doing anything but confusing a kid? It sounds like Lisa's a bit of a control freak, and that's not a behavior I'd like to pass on to my kids. Disciplines IS important, but so is temperance, and so is age appropriate punishment. There were some creative ideas in here, but also a whole lot of borderline instability.I'd take this book with a whole shaker of salt, using a few of the more creative ideas and tossing the rest."
2,Not good tips for parenting.,"I am a Cajun from Louisiana and I guarohntee that that hot sauce on de tounge do not correct dem youngins one bit. Dey love dat stuff. What am I to do wit dem? Dis Bioque done wrote dis book and she say you hot sauce dem chilluns, but it no work. Poo-yee-yi!"
5,"A Creative, Fun , Informational Book!","I have had Moon Magick for a few years and I always pick it up and read some of it again. It has great information on the Lunar Cycle and Moon Goddesses.The back of the book has a very useful list of several goddesses from around the world. It also has great recipes, crafts and lore for every month of the lunar year. I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a fun informational book."
3,"Somewhat lacking, but not bad for beginners.","Moon Magick was not the huge disappointment I expected it to be. It does give decent rituals (although Conway should emphasize that a rapport should be established with any deity before they are called into ritual, and significant research conducted as well.) I found the recipies to be not at all to my taste, and her moon lore sections were mildly pointless. I can't say anything to the accuracy of the festival dates she gives for other cultures. But please do your own research regarding her mythology. And please make sure that all rituals you perform are done in a ""proper"" environment, as she does not describe that well. This book is not heavy reading at all, so if that's what you're looking for, do NOT look here. Not a bad book, but try and get it on sale."
1,What would you expect from Llewellyn & Conway??,"I can't speak as to the general accuracy of the majority of the contents of this book, but I can tell you that specifically in the case of Conway's entry for Freyja she informs us that one of her alternate names, Syr, means ""seer."" A simply Wikipedia search can tell you it means ""sow."" In addition, she erroneously claims Freyja was in charge of the Valkyries. With simple facts such as these not checked by the author or the editors and publisher, why would you trust anything else in the book? If you're a serious student of Wicca I suggest you don't even bother."
5,one of conway's better books,"this book has the chapters go by each full moon,and each chapter tells about gods and goddesses,spells,rituals and crafts. this book is very useful and it is one of conway's best. alot better than her celtic and norse magic"
2,Written for the Northern Hemisphere,"I wish I had known that this book was written for the Northern Hemisphere before I bought it. It was disappointing to read chapters, only to realise that the seasons etc were reversed.For eg: June holds information on the Summer Solstice, yet in Australia, we are experiencing the Winter Solstice. In July there is a ritual called a Call for Rain. In Australia it's the middle of Winter, we don't exactly need to call for rain (with the exception of the drought ridden areas who would probably appreciate it).Just things like that all through the book. Yeah, yeah, I know - I can go through and write in the correct dates etc but, for the $35.00 the book cost me, I would prefer to have had the correct dates there already. If I had known it was written only for the Northern Hemisphere I wouldn't have bought the book."
2,Poorly constructed,"I tightened my cold shoe too much, and the fragile plastic base broke. I will rather recommend the Hama HA-6950 Universal Flash Adapter which has a metal base for a cold shoe."
1,Poor Quality - Pro's Stay-Away,"The product is not good and suffers from a major design flaw. It's actually a liability. The problem is that the hotshoe's foot is made of the thinest, flimsiest plastic and is guaranteed to break sending your flash perilously crashing to the floor. I ""carefully"" broke mine within 10 minutes of use. I say carefully, because I was trying to be very gentle once I saw its quality. Luckily, my flash was contained inside a pop-up softbox when it fell or I would really have been sorry. Do not be led to believe the bracket comes with this product as the current image indicates. It doesn't. I'm on to find a unit that I can trust."
2,Doesn't work with 580 Ex II,"The design is clever, the screwlock is nice, but it doesn't work with my 580 ex II (it does work with my old 580 ex). I'm picking up a few more impact connectors. . .which aren't great either but at least they work."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this on price. When I tried to use it, it was a very snug fit, actually didn't appear to seat properly with the flash unit. It wouldn't work once I added a PocketWizard. An email to their tech support went unanswered. Ended up buying from Paramount Cord instead, and am happy with their product."
2,Music videos but no subtitles,"Be careful if you are ordering this video because it does not actually have any subititles even though it says it should. I contacted Right Stuff International after I got my copy and they said it does not have subtitles. The music videos are cool, but it is pretty lame not to have subtitles."
4,Great stories from an independent mind,"I grew up without the benefit of city living, so it was with joy that I came across ""Tales from the Street"". Ms. Sharbaan, with her unique viewpoint, brings to life, with laughter and tears, the strife and survival of everyday people in NYC. Enjoy!"
3,Nice Photos...Well Presented,"Unfortunately thats about it. A better title would be Caterpillar Bulldozers (and a few others). There is no mention of Euclid, Dresser, Allis Chalmers etc. Nevertheless, a worthwhile book."
3,Excellent photos and weak text,"I read this regular book, here in Brazil. This book has excellent photos. In fact, more than 90% of this book are its photos. The text is easily to read and even has some prices of just a few bulldozers, but any of the chapters has enough space for it. This weak text leaves me to give just three stars for this book. The photos are five stars, but the text sents me to give just three stars for it."
4,Satisfied customer,"I have owned my Schwinn 113 exercise bike for about a month now and like it more every day. It assembled easily and is extremely convenient to use. The display is clear and intuitive, and the drive mechanism is unbelievably quiet. My only complaint is that the seat is hard and uncomfortable."
5,For the goal-oriented,"This bike has been nicknamed 'Marky' because it has much in common with the Marquis de Sade.Nonetheless, I DO love it. It is absolutely silent, user-friendly, very efficient, and really motivates you when you watch the numbers changing on the screen.As other reviewers have noted, the fan is a waste of time. You'll never feel it. But my bike arrived in perfect condition and only took about an hour to assemble.I called Schwinn before I ordered this bike to ask if the a/c power adapter was included, and it was. The box also includes all the tools required for assembly.So far, I have only used the 'manual' function and have kept the resistance at 7 for 30 minutes per session. This burns about 340-350 calories per session.It is a taskmaster, and actually very mean, but I love it anyway. It gets the job done."
2,Bike great when it works,"I loved this bike for 30 days, which is all the time it took for the magnetic gears to break. Schwinn was great on the phone and sent a technician to repair, but replacement motor didn't work and replacement electronics part was back-ordered for another 2 months. (It had already been broken for a month by then.) Begging and pleading with Schwinn supervisor resulted in a replacement bike. But I've had it 2 months and am beginning to get a knocking sound which is what preceded the previous bike's breakdown. If the bike were trouble-free, it would be a wonderful model; but my experience has been awful."
4,Very satisfied,I am very pleased with the Schwinn exercise bike. All of the features it has meet our needs and it's well worth the money. It seems to be heavy and well built for the cost. This form of exercise is especially good for my bad knees.
5,Upright Schwinn exercise bike review,"I love the new bike. The box came looking pretty beat up, but everything inside was great.Great value for the money."
4,great bike,"I've had my bike for several weeks now. Mine also (like a previous reviewer) arrived with a cracked part but Brings Cycling called back the same day I sent an email about this part and sent a new one out immediately.The seat is a little uncomfortable but it just takes some getting used to. The variety of programs is great and the fitness levels are tougher than I thought they would be so this bike will offer great workouts for a long time to come since there are I think, 16 fitness levels.I'm impressed with how quiet this bike is too. I'm really loving it. Consumer Reports rates it a best buy and that's why I chose this one."
4,"Schwinn 113 Upright Exercise Bike: Excellent, but Overqualified!","I purchased this bike via a Sears After-Christmas sale online. Judging from the torn up box it came in when I picked it up, I was a bit worried about what I'd find inside when I got home and opened it up.But ALL of the parts were there, and assembly was quick and easy. Once I got past the trial and error of the initial workouts on it (seat adjustment,the most appropriate seating level,learning the basic controls, etc.),it's operation has been quite smooth & flawless, as well as VERY quiet!!My only complaint:TOO many Bells and Whistles for what it is. But I guess many users would consider that to be a GOOD thing!!"
3,Poor Delivery / One Overlooked Instruction / Otherwise It's Good,"I have just a couple complaints:1. The bike was barely in its package when it arrived via UPS. The bike is quite heavy and the cardboard/styrofoam packaging had nearly fallen apart. UPS said they had to tape it together and that I should set it up immediately to ensure nothing had fallen out. Thankfully, despite the holes in the packaging, it was all there.2. The set-up went quite well except that I spent TWO HOURS trying to screw the left peddle into the frame. Let it be known: ""Lefty loosey, righty tighty"" is not a universal rule. When you get to the left peddle, save yourself hours -- turn it to the left!Otherwise, the bike is solid and functional. It also looks decent in my living room. I'm a relatively happy customer."
5,Quality Product at Reasonable Price,"If you are looking for cardio equipment for your home, it pays to check out the ratings by consumer reports. This stationary bike was recommended for its performance and was priced hundreds less than other high end bikes. It delivers as promised. I also have a Schwinn eliptical machine that was reviewed favorably by Consumer Reports. It is just as nice as the eliptical machines I use at the health club. It was delivered timely and was easy to put together."
4,A Great Bike for Workout,"This is a replacement of my old stationary bike. It works well for me and it's quite, comparing to my old one. I like the variety of workout programs and levels. I have been advancing my level for increased result. The footprint of this bike is small which is ideal for my living space. My family likes it too.The only issue we have with the bike is the height. We are all about 5' tall. The lowest point of the seat is too high for us. I have to drill a hole to make the seat lower. The control panel is also not designed for short people. If it can be designed for tilting, that will be perfect."
5,Fantastic!,We've been using our exercise bike for almost 2 months and love it. We love the range of preset rides and all of the different variables within the presets in addition to all of the manual options. I can already feel the difference it's made in the short time I've been using it. It's a wonderful alternative to going to the gym.
4,Nice bike,"Like many of the reviewers before shipping did take its toll but nothing that was enough to call for replacement (a crease in the plastic in the back seam, and another minor thing or two like that). It's a solid well built bike with lots of bells and whistles. Pros: Nice display, very adjustable, very quiet Cons: included seat isn't the most comfortable (replaced it with a schwinn hornless), fan is basically useless unless you are leaning into it.Not the bikes fault but I'm wishing I would have went with the recumbent model now just for ease of use, but then again I am warming up to this one as I'm getting used to it."
4,Quality product,We have had this bicycle for a couple of months now. It's a great product sturdy and easy to use. We like it very much.
1,Were's the Beff?,I thought I was buying a book on Iraq that deal with thecurrent debate. I got fooled I should have knownwith the word Armageddon on the cover.
2,"well, we can see by your comment you are a kid","but try to do more than just stay in your home, reading your bible... world is really more difficult to understand than you fundamentalists think..."
3,Nice Irish Songs,the music was great but lacked diversification. Expected more. Hard to tell who was singing. Needs better programinginformation. Added it to my library.
2,Not the same movie described in the Leonard Maltin review,"Viewers should disregard the Leonard Maltin editorial review above, which is of a different movie. This one concerns the daughter of a bounty hunter kidnapped and taken to Guatemala. The film tries to blend noir elements with ""after dark"" - style soft core, but with only partial success. The unrated version I saw does contain some hot footage, especially the love scenes with Lauren Hays and Nikki Fritz. Overall, worth renting but not purchasing."
3,"good idea, bad gameplay","The idea behind Evil Genius is much like the idea behind the Dungeon Keeper series: build a base to attract minions and then try to take over the world by crushing the silly forces of good. Unfortunately, the game has way too much micro managing when it comes to the combat system and takes way way too much time. If you liked Dungeon Keeper and Startopia, this game will keep you amused for a few hours before you get fed up and want to strangle your own minions for setting off the bases automated defenses."
2,Borders on great but has fatal flaw - don't buy it.,"I was prepared to give this game a great review just as the others here have. I spent countless hours building up a vast underground base, gaining worldwide noteriety, and getting some good research going. Then, super agent ""Mako"" walks in and basically just ended the game. I had dealt with other agents but this character walked in as an invincible game entity. He fought and killed all but about 3 of my men (and still had full health), killed (got his 3rd and final life) my last remaining henchman, and destroyed about 50% of my base before I hit the ""Exit Game"" button. Strategy no longer applied: days worth of game play building this empire was rewarded by having it all ended by some extremely poor game design. As a result, I believe I'll be freeing about 1.3 gigs of hard drive space..."
1,Wait for the patch,"Fun game, but it has a number of bugs. Most important is one which corrupts the save game files -- your Evil Genius dies instantly on load. No reliable workaround yet. Very frustrating."
1,Bugged- can't even install,"I used to own a copy of this game back in the day, and it was better than sliced bread. So, when I saw Amazon had it, I had to get a new copy. Unfortunately, my computer wouldn't even recognize the disk, let alone install it. The workaround for it is to download a ""noCD crack"" from the internet. Thanks, but no thanks. While I would never recommend steam in a million years, apparently they have an updated copy available. So if nostalgia strikes, I'd actually recommend going with their version. I'll just chalk up this $12 as lost:("
3,Fun at first yet....,"Fun at first yet the gameplay gets tedious.Good for around twenty hours. Then you realise your just doing the same thing over and over.You build your base, someone destroys something, you rebuild it, then agents destroy it again."
3,"Had potential for more, but IMPRESSIVE nonetheless","""2000 A.D."", starring Heavenly King Aaron Kwok, boosted up Raintree Pictures of Singapore to a new level. Aaron Kwok, Richard Ng, and the bad-guy (forgot his name:P) all give the audience new perspectives. The editing is very original, and sound will blow you away. ""2000 A.D."" managed to bring audiences something new. With special effects brought to the screen from the team that worked on ""INDEPENDENCE DAY"", and with Aaron Kwok being the first to fly an F16 in an Asian film, director Gordan Chan never fails at surprising his audience. However, if you're looking for kung-fu, go look for Jet Li classics. If you're looking for something to blow-up and make the walls shake, ""2000 A.D."" is near perfect. Director Gordan Chan did well, and even though Aaron's acting was at times sketchy, overall performance and plot were well developed. - Priscilla"
2,Length not as stated.,"They are not the stated 3 ft length. Just 2 1/2 ft.This is not only dishonest, but held me up on a project."
3,"Somewhat flat, though often beautiful in its own way.","Jen Wood's songwriting has a problem with being highly repetitive, sometimes even monotonous. Her guitar playing, a low drone that suggests bass playing techniques, usually reserves itself to the low end, and her minimalistic arrangements (guitar/vocal) gets tiresome after a while.Given that, she does have a nice voice reminiscent of Suzanne Vega, good harmonies when she indulges, and the churning strums of her guitar achieves a kind of moody appeal. It's just a shame that she doesn't vary her performances enough to sustain an entire album. Getting Past the Static corrects somewhat on these flaws."
4,A delicate and subtle exploration of belonging.,"These stories read like the petals of a flower-come upon individually, scattered on the sidewalk or in a breeze, they tell of some unknown, casual violence, a tearing-apart- and, equally, of the unseen whole. Together, they become a thing of beauty, fragile and admirable- an evocation, in words, of places and moments that cannot be expressed in any less oblique fashion than longing and recollection. They are at once almost blindingly personal and philosophically universal, and will remain with you for a long time after you're done."
3,Hair Care,"Pros:-Shani's hair can never get tangled, because of the way it's made.-The clothes are okay. Not fabulous, but fairly satisfying. And they can't tear because they're made of real fabric.Cons:-The doll's hair isn't as easy to style as it looks. My friend just got this doll, and still doesn't exactly know how to style her hair.-The set has this cheap look to it. I can't decide if it really is cheap or not, but I know it LOOKS cheap.Worth:If you like to style hair (After figuring out how), or are a Polly Pocket fan, I would recommend this. If you want a set with neat accessories and a cute doll, I wouldn't recommend this.P.S. This review is my opinion, and no one's comments in their own reviews ""replying"" to mine can change that."
5,The best you can get.,"Smullyans ""First-Order Logic"" is the best of its kind. Easy to read, well-writen and with yust the nesesary formalism. A small book that covers a lot of subjects of first order logic. Get it while you can."
4,"Another Christmas ""Regency""","This book gave me an afternoon of pleasant reading and a fresh new story with familiar characters. I missed Rosa and Brand, but was happy for the dialogue with Portia. The style is different than the other Malloren novels, instead Winter Fire reads a lot like Beverley's Christmas Regencies such as Christmas Angel and Forbidden Magic. If you want frequent juicy sex scenes this is not the book. If you want a sweet romance that is satisfying in plot and character development (still containing a bout of sizzling sex) this is for you. I enjoyed the book and will read it again before Christmas."
2,not what i expected,"i am a big jo beverly fan...love her books..but, this one was confusing for a few chapters which made it tedious to read....i'm familiar with the characters from her others books but the whole story just dragged..........i will not give up on ms beverly tho because i loved her other books"
2,Ash & Genova..,"This story wasn't interesting, and I'm not sure I believe 2 complete strangers who sleep together shortly after meeting can build true love. Especially when the question theyask each other is 'will you be faithful to me'.Rothgar was fabulous as usual. As much as I love this guy, I know he's never going to say the wrong thing because he's so darn formal All the time, even when he's supposedly relaxing.I didn't like the idea that Ash had bastard children, and I especially didn't like it when Ash flat out told Genova that even if he was Charlie's father, he would drop the baby at an orphange with some money and not look back.The Aunts were okay, I guess, but 'Grandy' was just an old biddy."
2,Quick and Boring !!!!,"This book reads quickly, which is good!!But I found it very boring, not what I am used to from Ms. Beverly."
4,Wow!,"This seems best used in conjunction with a therapist. I found it difficult to get started. The topics are very good, and will open one's eyes if done seriously. This one's not for those who just want to vent, but rather to do some serious self-work. Good luck, it's hard!"
3,Writings....,It isn't as I expected I wanted more space to write and topics to help me get going......
2,Terrible video quality,"Cute TV show, but the video transfer is terrible. Like watching something from the 1930's."
3,Fun Toy,"My 6 year old girl loves her new castle and describes it as fun to play with. We did have some trouble getting it to work in the beginning, but after following the directions exactly we can get it to work everytime now. The secret is to hear a click when putting the lever on the side down."
3,Small,The castle is very small in comparison to the figures that go with it. My grandaughter loved it just the same.
2,Piece of Trash,"My six year old daughter just got this for her birthday. After less than ten minutes, the castle broke and wouldn't launch the fairy anymore. I returned it, and the same thing happened. We just opened the third castle, and guess what- it won't work!! I'm done. Do NOT buy this!!! What a waste of money!!"
1,Piece of JUNK!!!,"My daughter got this for Christmas and the SkyDancer never launched. Ever. I finally got around to replacing it and guess what... the new one doesn't work either. I've read the instructions over and over - it's just a piece of junk, cheaply made, totally not worth the $30. They have the other SkyDancers too which should be called SkyDancer Missiles. They are dangerous!! Not too surprised this castle is no longer being sold at Amazon. Wonder how many complaints/returns they got?!"
1,This toy is not worth the money.,This toy is not worth the money. The fiber optic strings come out of the slot were the lever goes up an down and get stuck. It jams the lever so the strings do not lift all the way. The they get bent and stick out the side. I am sorry I wasted money on this toy.
4,Great CD but wait until Oct. 25 for a better one,"That's right on Oct. 25, 2005 Cowboy Bill will have a nationally released CD/DVD. Speaking from experience, you have to see him perform to catch the entire essence of Cowboy Bill Martin."
2,poor Anne,I was disappointed to see that thiz dvd was simply a transfer from vhs. Grainy and not even wixdscreen. $$$ was not worth it.
5,Excellent Movie!,"I highly recommend this video if you are looking for an uplifting, romantic, comical movie. Be ready to cry, laugh, and love this movie!!"
5,Meagan Follows gives an EXCELLENT performance!,"I think it is the best sequal ever! It gave a warm and romantic feeling and describes the real value of friendship. In my opinion, everyone who performed were unforgetable and brought the characters to life. TWO thumbs up for Anne of Aonlea!"
2,"This is not ""Anne of Avonlea"", the book!","WARNING! This movie is not Anne of Avonlea! They took vague portions of varying plots out of ""Anne of Avonlea"", ""Anne of the Island"", and ""Anne of Windy Poplars"". The truth is, this movie begins about where ""Anne of Avonlea"" began and skips directly to ""Anne of Windy Poplars"", but not even that. It is the most shocking cinematic reproduction of a great literary masterpiece I have ever encountered. I don't want to dis on the movie too much, it would be good if they had not pretended it to be ""Anne of Avonlea"". If you loved the books, do not watch this movie. But if you love this movie and haven't read the books be prepared for a shock. I just hope someone someday makes real cinematic reproductions of the ""Anne"" book"
5,Highly entertaining.,"This is my all time favorite series and even my husband loves it. Over the years, we have watched it many times and never tire of seeing it again. It is awesome family entertainment!"
4,Wonderful Story with great traditional values...A must for the family!,"Great Buy! I gave it four stars because the plot is not as heart wrenching as 'Anne of Green Gables'. This is the sequel to 'Anne of Green Gables' and it is very well done, but if you want to be truly blessed with a tender story, especially for the young at heart, no-matter what the age, see 'Anne of Green Gables' or read the book.We would also recommend the whole collection of 'Anne of Green Gables, Boxed Set' by L.M. Montgomery's. As usual, so much more can be obtained from reading this series.Received the VHS tape well before the due date and in great shape. More than happy with the condition of the tape and will use this merchant again when needed."
2,Not for Montgomery fans,"For fans of the Montgomery Anne series ""The Sequel"" can be very disapponting. I have read (and loved) the Anne series and I found the movie sequel disappointing because the characters such as Davy and Dora I had grown to love were absent from the movie.I do like the movie, but I think if you have read the series and adored it you can't help but be disappointed by the numerous changes. The events in the movie are extremely different to the chronological sequence Montgomery intended them in. I adored the movie ""Anne of Green Gables"" which had changed slightly from the book but the movies following seem to lose the Montgomery style. For fans of Montgomery I would not recommend the movie; however for those just getting into Anne the movies would be a nice place to start."
1,Format Transfer Ripoff,"The Canadian company that transferred this sequal from VHS toDVD should be ashamed. This, for the price, is the worst qualityDVD I have ever viewed. It is worse than a VHS time-shift recording at the slowest speed. I feel like I have really beentaken! DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Misrepresented,"I purchased this for my girlfriend, who is deaf, and don't be fooled by the information presented above, my copy was not subtitled in any way shape or form."
1,wrong material,"I had read that in the boxed sets the wrong DVD appeared for the continuation story, so I specifically ordered them separately. Unfortunately I had the exact same problem! Instead of the sequel, the box contained the original Anne of Green Gables series. Very disappointing!!"
1,Sacrelige,"Being an avid Anne fan, I found this movie to be sacreligious in the sense that it tore her story to bits. I understand that it is necessary to cut out bits from time to time, but creating characters that never existed in Ms. Montgomery's stories seems wrong somehow. Megan Follows makes an ideal Anne, as much as she did in the first film, but that is about all this movie has going for it. If you truly enjoy the Anne series of books, I cannot reccomend this movie."
5,Revisiting Old Childhood Favorites,"This is one of my favorite films as a child and I was beyond excited to get it on DVD (while being outdated, my VHS copy has actually worn out). I bought a copy for myself and a copy for my mother (and of the first film). I'm looking forward to sharing this amazing adaptation with my nieces. I will not, however, be purchasing the third film (Anne of Avonlea the Continuing Story) as it was a horrendous adaptation, didn't follow the books and the storyline was horrible. I'm glad to stop at these two, although I wish they would have adapted the rest of the books as well - and kept the storyline the same."
1,Poor Quality,"I found this DVD to be of poor quality it was grainy quality. It was a good thing I kept my VHS copies. I don't recommend this product. It is a shame too, I love this series."
5,Another Favorite,I love this writer. I have read all of her books that I could get my hands on. This movies brings her writings to life.
2,Biting off more than it can chew,"What were the filmmakers thinking? They had made a wonderful screen adaptation of the first book in ANNE OF GREEN GABLES, but in this movie they have butchered some really good books.They totally misinterpreted the character of Anne when they got her involved in a pointless romance! What was that about? -- making Anne in the image of a daytime soap opera?Apart from that is the fact that they try to patch together three of the novels into one movie. Where's the sense in that?However the movie isn't a total loss, with good acting by Megan Follows and Colleen Dewhurst and some good supporting characters.Altogether, I say this is a rather disappointing sequal to an extraordinary first film."
1,Disappointing!,"You got to be kidding with this movie. In no way this has the same feeling as the first two movies. First, it doesn't even follow the books (Gilbert in no way goes into WWI) second, there is no ""warm feeling"" you get when watching Anne Shirley. It was a plot that was poorly put together. The original characters barely have a scene with Anne. I would say though the last half hour was not bad but in the whole it was a disappointing effort. Please if you're going to do a movie of Anne stick with the books. You can change it a little like they did with the first 2 movies but still it kept with the plot of the books this movie was an atrocious effort. I hope they get it right if they want to make another movie, please can we at least have Anne's and Gilbert's children in it!"
1,No Comparison For the Book,"I'd like to say that while I thoroughly enjoyed Anne of GreenGables I think that Anne of Avonlea really butchers the story. This is probably only because I've read the Anne books, though. I think that by combining too many stories into one it kind of makes Anne of Avonlea boring. After all they left out some of the best parts and richest characters in the books. And I could cry tears over how the Christine and Gilbert angle and the Roy Gardner ""mysterious unknown"" character are butchered. This however has no reflection on the first movie, Anne of Green Gables, which I consider to be a true classic."
3,"Great movie,[bad] DVD transfer","I love Anne of Green Gables the Sequel (actually Anne of Avonlea). Megan Follows did a great job as Anne Shirley the temperamental redhead who aspires to be a teacher and writer. The movie itself is one of my all-time favorites and if you want it on DVD, it's worth it to get it.That said, the transfer is one of the poorest I've laid eyes on. It comes in only a 2.0 soundtrack, doesn't even make a virtual center channel or subwoofer like other 2.0 DVDs do and the picture is a bit grainy and I detect a pulsing in the background. Also it's in fullscreen pan and scan format instead of anamorphic which reduces the resolution to about that of a VHS. That said, it does have a good menu with extras including some deleted scenes.Overall, if you're looking to get it on DVD go ahead and get it, but don't expect great DVD quality."
5,Anne of Avonlea,"If you ever fell in love with Anne of Green Gables, then you have to see this movie! Megan Follows was so moving she kept you glued to the screen! This movie really does justice to the book, it might even be better!"
4,This is not that terrible third movie!!,"That said, I'd like to point out that many people on this side (that being North) of the U.S. border found this particular story *much* more endearing than the first movie. Anne goes beyond being charmingly clumsy and becomes a headstrong (very admirable) woman.I found this movie much more engaging than the first one -- with Anne Shirley's competition with Gilbert Blythe evolving, and a glimpse into her inspirational life as a teacher.This movie is, of course, incredibly saccharin, but uplifting and really very deeply moving. It's one of my personal favourites.The *only* reason I would give this 4 stars, as opposed to 5, is the relative lack of extras (which is understandable, since no one at the time would have thought to document any ""behind the scenes"" moments or anything). Still, when I'm dealing with DVDs, I like my extras."
1,Worst DVD encoding... EVER,"As good as the content of the movie is, the current DVD release should be avoided AT ALL COSTS. The compression (the way that the picture information is stored) is EXTREMELY POOR. While the source material is terrific, it is completely undermined by a picture quality that, while more colorful, is far more distracting and ugly than even VHS tape. My advice is to call or email Sullivan Entertainment until they decide to release a DVD version of this show that does not rip the customers off."
5,Anne of Green Gables,"Fantastic movie!Wonderful scenery, very moving. It is a story to watch over and over and over again. Highly recommended for everyone."
4,The Sequel,"I enjoyed Anne of Green Gables the Sequel. I read previous comments about poor video quality, but mine was just fine. I enjoyed the story and I'm anxious to read the books (they're on my Christmas list) to see how the movie varied from the books since I read a lot of comments about how they are so different."
5,Anne of Avonlea,"I loved this movie so much, and I already had it, but wanted to give it to a friend also as a gift and she loved it too! Thanks for the great, fast service too!!"
5,Anne of Green Gables The Sequel,Once again Kevin Sullivan has transformed our Anne from paper to the screen without leaving her spirit out. Megan Follows continues to shine in her portrayal of Anne. The DVD a most have for Anne fans with bonus material that only Avonlea fans can appreciate.
5,Outstanding entertainment!,Loved the values taught in this series. But where is Megan Follows these days? Is she not in the field any longer?
5,Just as good as the first.,"This sequel will not let you down. It is heart warming and inspiring. Keep it in the library, it is worth watching over and over."
5,Love this movie!,"This has always been a wonderful favorite of mine!! I love to put it on and watch (directly following the first one, of course)!! It's perfect for those days when you're snowed in and have no where to go (like today)!!"
2,I Hoped for Better,"I am a huge fan of the Anne of green Gables books, but in my opinion, this movie really really needs to stay much more faithful to the story. The first movie puts this to shame. It didn't even include Davy and Dora the twins that Marilla adopted. The most and only impessive thing about it is the performance by Megan Follows. It was really quite uninteresting as opposed to the books."
5,A really good movie,"I loved the movie almost as much as the books. I recommend it to everyone. And allthough the movie is great, the books are really better, so if you watched the movie, and liked it... PLEASE!! Read the books!!!"
2,Like waking up on Christmas to find you have gotten socks...,"I remember finding an Anne of Green Gables website, and reading that a third movie was coming out. I was extremely thrilled. I knew that the third movie would not be based on the books, but I had loved the first two movies so much, that I was sure the third movie would be wonderful.I waited for months and months for the movie to complete filming, then several more months for it to be played in the States. It was shown in June of last year (I believe) on a public broadcasting station.I came away from watching the movie feeling very flat. There was nothing charming about the movie. Of course, it was about the WWI time period, but the story line seemed like a soap-opera-meets-a-one-hour-television-war-drama.I thought I might purchase the movie anyway, because I have the other two on video tape, but I will probably wait until I spot someone selling a copy for (dollar amount)."
1,How depressing!,"I grew up loving the first two movies so I was very excited when I heard about the third installment. After watching it, however, I was aghast! How completely horrible. The storyline is depressing and contrived. It was very predictable and second rate. I can't imagine the author Lucy Maud Montgomery ever conjuring up such a depressing storyline. She would turn over in her grave!"
5,simple wonderful,wonderful and sweet. Although adapted from the books - this movie brings me a good case of the cozies every time I watch it.Gold stars all around.
5,Live Wild America!,"Like a lot of people, I'm a pet lover. However this dvd set has turned me into an eager wildlife student. I originally bought it for my nephew, who would live at a zoo if he could, but I was surprised to see that there are many more animals in American wildlife than I could've ever expected. This series has just the right amounts of spontaneity and humor from the host and the animals. My nephew and I loved it!"
2,Not To Be Taken Too Seriously,"MYSTERIES OF THE BIBLE is a small book which attempts to give brief overviews of fifteen biblical mysteries. Three examples of the latter are the exact date of the birth of Jesus, the identity of the Queen of Sheba and the present location of the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The author does not attempt to give definite answers but instead describes the various competing theories about each mystery.The book provides at best a shallow treatment of several complex questions and probably about one hour's worth of light entertainment for the reader."
4,Not a bad trip to Sesame Street,"This video is fun but has the new Sesame Street feel. Clips toward the end of the DVD are my boys favorite part while the main story is long and have bored most of the 5 and under kids that have watched it in my house. Good background play noise. Look for ""Cookie Monsters Best Bites"" it is much more Cookie Monster and much more fun."
4,Definitely not white but still a good deal,"This is a well made dresser and is a nice size for a small bedroom. Like the other items in this line the color is not white, it is really more of a cream color. The antiquing looks good for RTA furniture though and the drawer knobs and feet add a nice touch. I recommend this item but if you are looking for a whole set, just pay close attention to the dimensions of the other pieces. The bookcases are nice, the desk with hutch is huge as well as the larger armoire. The smaller one with just doors is ok but is quite a bit bigger than this dresser. I think a lot of places show the 5 drawer dresser under the youth sections, where as the other pieces are not."
3,Strong Start But Sputters Near the End,"This movie gets off to a great start. People in the town of Antioch have visions of three men who perform miracles in their lives and announce that ""He is coming."" The town is stirred with excitement.The leader of the three is Brandon Nichols, and his charismatic persona, his miracles, and his nail scarred hands have followers filled with frenzy. Could this be the Christ?But a chain of events and second thoughts move an ex-minister and a veterinarian to pursue the truth about Brandon. The conclusion of the film is somewhat less than satisfying and maddeningly leaves a few loose ends behind.But it was definitely a thrilling, scary film, especially the first half."
3,Little strange,"I bought this because of the fact that Randy Travis was in it. The movie is very unbelievable and somewhat out of character for Randy Travis. If I had known now what I know about this movie, I would not have bought it."
1,I've seen horror movies that are better than this!,I don't see how anyone can say this is a good movie. This is a terrible movie. If you read the book you would see that this movie does not do the book any justice. I can't believe how awful this movie is. I am disappointed that I wasted my money on this awful movie. I think one star for a rating is being way too generous.
2,"Should be called: ""The Disappointment""","I really like the movies that I've seen where the creative genius of David AR White and Kevin Downes are involved - at least up until this one.I also thought that being based on a novel by Frank Peretti might give it a redeeming quality - but I was wrong.I don't write ""spoiler"" type reviews, so I'll just say that this movie presents Christianity in the dark and twisted ""Stephen King"" style and leave it at that. This movie is tagged as a ""Supernatural Thriller."" I think it would be better tagged as ""Christian Horror"" - if such an oxymoron of a category could even exist.I gave this a (generous) rating of two stars based on my expectations of a David White / Kevin Downes production, but in fairness I should say that I would give it a five star rating if my expectations were along the lines of a Stephen King work."
1,Neither entertaining nor encouraging,"At the end of this movie I asked myself ""What was the point of this movie?"" It pointed out that people can be easily deceived and led astray, that the devil has power, and that a ""Christians"" (the main character's father) was terribly abusive! This video was neither entertaining nor uplifting."
1,Disappointed,"I read the novel ""The Visitation"" about a week ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I couldn't put it down until I was finished. I was excited to discover that the movie would be out on DVD this week and bought it on release day.Although I was not expecting a big budget film like ""The Passion"" or ""Narnia"", I was hoping for a lot more than I got for my $20. I did expect the movie to be a condensed version of the book but there was little in this movie that resembled anything in the book save the names of the characters.I wanted to like this movie so much because I want to support Christian films, but when they take a really good book like ""The Visitation"" and make it into a really bad movie, I can't help but be disappointed.If more movies are made based on Frank Peretti novels in the future, I hope they will be as worthwhile to watch as the novels are to read. This one was not even close."
4,Scariest Movie I've ever liked,"Most of the time I don't like watching scary movies, but the great Christian theme throughout the movie tied it all together well and made it a hair-raising watch. I read the book before watching the movie, so if you liked the movie, you should definitely read the book--it was even scarier! but sooo good."
3,Too scary for younger kids,"The Visitation was ""enjoyed"" by my 12 y/o, and as far as the rating goes (PG-13) it is a bit too scary for the younger ones. There are some graphic scenes which may be too much for younger eyes to see. The moral message (beware of false prophets) is one that would benefit from having an adult believer watching with preteens/teens to discuss during and after the movie."
2,Failed to capture the spirit of the story,"I found that the movie did not capture the essence of the book. The main villain, Brandon, did not enter the story as an even remotely convincing Jesus. He looked more like a college drop-out dope addict. The plot had one character or another screaming every few minutes, as a substitute for genuine intrigue.While reading the discussion boards for a similar movie, ""Thr3e,"" I noticed that many of the participants referred to this movie as an example of what a movie should not be. They would say, ""I hope this isn't another Visitation,"" or, ""It wasn't what I was hoping for, but it wasn't as bad as The Visitation."""
2,Boobs all over the place,"I just purchased a set of these to wear in a bridesmaid's dress, as the bodice on the dress requires a C cup and I am a mere B. Well, these little silicone boobs are fine and they do they job. HOWEVER, get the adhesive strips to save yourself a lot of agony. They don't want to stay in place, much less stay in the bra. If you try to wear them alone, you will have - as the title says - boobs all over the place. Oh, and to all those women out there buying these things - send in your comments. I wish someone had been kind enough to let me know to use adhesive strips to keep these puppies in place."
2,Better Bridge Heads Available.,"This bridge head requires a threaded bridge stick, which makes it a little harder to setup. The limited range of available heights is not great for shooting over balls or shots with a lot of draw. Keep looking."
5,Simply great!,"I could sum up this entire recording in one word...WOW! Dark and brooding, intense and sinister. I simply cannot believe this came out when it did! Just buy it, for no other reason than to have something to blow away all of your friends Black Sabbath, Sepultura, or White Zombie CDs come Halloween time!"
3,Italian prog-rockers go to extremes on this one.,"Think of PFM on a bad acid trip, and you have a good idea what this album sounds like. A pummeling (some might say punishing) musical journey through instrumental dissonance and over-the-top vocals sung in Italian, the album leads you through the kind of nightmarish dirges you might hear after passing out from too much Italian wine and too many spicy meatballs. Not to say that these players aren't talented (a very high standard of musicianship here, typical of most Italian progsters), but YS lacks much of the beauty, depth and nuance of PFM's best early work. Still recommended, though, for the more adventurous '70s prog fanatic."
3,3.5 stars,"Contrary to other reviews presented below, I do not find this disc to be among the ""classic"" Italian prog-rock recordings. What made bands like PFM, Le Orme, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, Locande del Fatte and Museo Rosenbach (to name a few) so exceptional is that they were able to combine a strong melodic/compositional sense with stellar musicianship. Those bands also possessed strong vocalists which only served to further enhance the delivery of their collective efforts. Unlike those bands Balletto were not as strong compositionally. Their sense of melody is somewhat lacking, not bad just not up to the competition. The vocalist is also an acquired taste. The musicianship is quite strong throughout. This is a harder more disturbed sounding Italian prog-rock. Vander Graf Generator may be the best comparison one can make in regard to tone and scope. Not a classic, but still of interest...Simon"
3,This shampoo was just so-so for me. I ...,"This shampoo was just so-so for me. I really liked the fragrance and thought it was very pleasant and made my hair smell great!! However, I didn't think it was any better than comparable brands I already use. I use shampoos for fine hair that cost much less than Herbal Essences and probably will continue to use those. I just didn't find anything that impressive that'd justify spending more money to buy it."
3,I liked the way this shampoo smelled. It ...,"I liked the way this shampoo smelled. It left my hair feeling very clean and light. However, it didn't really do anything for my fine, limp hair. Actually, I didn't expect it to do anything for my lifeless hair. Since it was made for fine, limp hair, I thought it might do something, but no. However, overall, I liked the product a lot."
4,I liked the smell and how my hair ...,I liked the smell and how my hair felt after using it. I'd definitely purchase it and recommend it to my friends and family.
1,Fiction masquerading as history,"This is undoubtedly one of the worst books I've ever read on Australian history and I've read a great many including several on Mary Bryant by authors who knew what they were talking about.Almost everything about Mary Bryant in this book is just plain wrong. Or, to put it more clearly, most of it didn't happen that way. Don't waste your money."
3,Bought against my better judgement,"Bought a long time ago and borrowed it out. Coerced by a friend to get it again... so he could borrow it. Not happening, will give it to him. Not that great of a deal for a much older pc 'toy'... and instructions suck!"
3,Pretty good,some good basics and a couple of key pointers. A lot of info in the 1/2 hour video but could have been longer
2,Does NOT include real instruction from poker pros,"The cover implies you're going to get tips and secrets from Daniel Negraneau and Lee Watkinson. We're talking about 10-15 second sound bites, folks! There were also short clips from Chris Moneymaker and others... Most of this is just Vince Van Patten reading from a script. And sometimes he reads too quick (he seems to be reading from a teleprompter).You'd be better off with the Caro book and videos. However, the production quality is great, and if you don't have access to anything else, the information is decent. That's why I rated this two stars instead of one. I'm still ticked off by the false advertising, however. If you have the Caro book or videos, this video will just tick you off too."
4,service your own AC,"Seems like it works well, no problems yet. easy and convienient.also, it iis less harsh than bleech. I like that alot."
5,Soundtrack artist in the making.,"A striking, haunting, structure with moody melodies and poetic lyrics. This music is a soundtrack to the movie playing in musician Peter Feliciano's mind. There are some very interesting textures. He goes from dark, foggy, melancholy music beds, to funky upbeat rhythms, and everything in between. This guy should be scoring films."
4,Like a Glass of Well-Aged Wine,"Aquarium has the impact of a glass of well-aged wine: full-bodied, complex, and sophisticated. The album is too passionate and tangy to be relegated to background music. A thought-provoking blend of styles and themes, Aquarium defies traditional labels. It is worth a listen, and then worth savoring."
4,AQUARIUM REVIEW,"I LIKED IT! THE MUSIC HAD DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOUNDS THAT SHOWED THE CREATIVITY AS WELL AS THE TALENT OF THE ARTIST. I ALSO LIKED THE FACT THAT ONE SONG HAD SO MANY DIFFERENT TRANSITIONS IN IT,A PAT METHENY TRADEMARK.THE SONGS WERE LONG,BUT THE MANY DIFFERENT SOUNDS ARE WHAT MADE IT AN OUTSTANDING CD. A NEW TALENT ON THE BLOCK? COULD BE."
1,Errors in book,"This grammar guide has errors, e.g. Page 135: ""Le ho telefonato"" is translated as ""I have already phoned her"" -- but there is no ""gia'"" (""already"") in the Italian version, which should read ""I have phoned her""; this sentence was correct in the 1st edition. Page 231: ""Scusi"" (familiar) should be ""Scusa."" There are other errors, some of them correct in the 1st edition. It is inexcusable that a guide for those learning Italian is not 100% reliable."
1,Too many mistakes,This book needed more careful editing and proofreading--there are too many mistakes. Readers of this guide are looking for guidance in learning Italian and it is disturbing to find a grammar guide that steers you wrong. I found several incorrect examples and have no idea how many more I may have missed -- if I knew them all I wouldn't need this kind of book.
5,great tips,"this book was great many tips on cleaning, looking for pups,training... everything specific to pugs. if you are getting one read this book first!!"
2,Not That Great,This unit does not recognise all media. I had trouble burning dual-layer discs. I am going to buy a plextor to replace this.
4,Porcelain Water Dispenser,This product looks nice and assembles easily. The dispenser does not leak and is easy to fill.
5,Wonderful,"We had an electric water cooler for a number of years; however, it would leak from time to time and make a big mess; this water dispenser is not only attractive, but totally efficient and fits right in with our decor. We are very pleased with our purchase."
2,BENT,"REVIEW OF ITEM:Ames True Temper Eagle Square Point Shovel With 46-Inch Fiberglass Handle 1348300The Bad: The shovel I received has a bent and/or twisted blade. Rough handling during shipping is not likely to have caused the problem. The shovel blade is made in China.The Good: The shovel is light, strong, and easy to handle.Bottom Line: Unless you need a shovel that is straight and well-aligned, this shovel works."
5,thanks,this shovel was exactly what we were looking for. we needed to find a flat shovel for our brother-in-law and he loved it.
3,Not As Good As I Thought They'd Be,"I ordered these without seeing them first which was a mistake --The table tops were scratched and the laquer applied unevenly - there are rough spots all over that makes it really annoying to wipe down. I had to buy placemats. The upside is that the tables seem to be very sturdy.The stand that holds all of the tables was annoying to assemble. The directions were just pictures of the parts with arrows pointing to an already assembled stand (somewhat confusing). Some of the pieces did not fit and had to be jammed in.I thought the quality would be better than the less costly version, but I was apparently wrong. They do what they're supposed to, so I'm giving it 3 stars, but I would not buy these again."
5,Awe-inspiring book,"Reading this book gave me much hope. It is very honest and gives clear guideposts, all very well expressed by the author.There is so much in it, I need to read it again and again. It can be valued by people of all kinds of backgrounds."
5,Essential for happy living,"Cannot believe that anyone can survive in life without having read this book. For the first time after reading this book, I am able to really understand my true purpose as a child of God, and also to fully comprehend teachings of my own religion.This book has been the answer to providing me with a fulfilling and purposeful life. I am now able to truly love and appreciate God."
2,dissapointed,"I've been reading the book, and had a feeling it explained a lot.Finally, i could use it, but the code used is very outdated (01-2005). That's why i visited their website.as the book refers to the site often.http://www.xmlphp.com/check it yourself, no updates, the forum is closed.why did i buy this book?"
2,Out of Date,"I've been reading this book recently (6/11/2004). With regards to DOM and XML, it's very out of date given the current development of PHP. Would advise newer, more up to date book if you're interested in DOM and XML."
3,lots of nudity in some short scenes or clips,"this movie is just a bunch of short skits of women in differnent situations. now it does show some scenes whith some of the biggest breast in porn. like candy samples, ushie digard, and Roxanne Brewer. even though I cant rally call roxanne a porn star because she only appeared in one porn film where she has sex but the film was so choppy it might not have even been here in the sex scene just a shot of some couple haveing sex they never showed her whole body during that scenes. she is more of the stripper type and she plays short skits just to show her breast. all in all not a bad film but no sex just some R rated skits oh they didnt have a BJ scene with john homes and some sex which was the only porn type act in this film."
3,Oh dear...,Wow. This is one of Richard Franklin's first films who'd go on to do GOOD films in the ninties. He's probably the only director whose made the transition from porno to corporate thriller so smoothly... and he's Australian too... We all know about those AUSTRALIAN films now don't we? Crocodiles and... er... Bill Hunter... Anyway this film is really rank but some nice looking ladies in the first half.Watch it for Rene Bond.
5,Sparks of light,"Time is a funny thing. Sometimes it exists sometimes not. I love to spend times with Emmet Fox because time does not exist between us. It's the profound inner space that counts. This book was published 1938. It came out year later then Sparks of Truth. These Sparks originally appeared as weekly messages on the Sunday Programs. The topics are as thought provoking as they were 74 years ago. Perhaps even more so. Just think about the Great Depression... Good teachers have always had a simple and a clear way of presenting their ideas. Emmet Fox was a brilliant, influential and humble teacher. If you look carefully around, you realize that many of today's spiritual teachers are his 'children'."
5,a great overlooked film,"""Unmade Beds"" cleverly uses the motif of the dating game to take a clear-eyed, penetrating look at modern neurosis and how the myriad distractions of urban life mirror our fractured sense of self. The four characters are initially quite sympathetic in their quest for love, but as the film progresses they reveal a pathological sense of self-loathing and meaninglessness, in turn making them very unattractive. It's a very entertaining and vastly underrated film, and the soundtrack is in fact very witty and contemporary. Recommended."
4,real-life stories about finding love in new york city,"This dark comedy about meeting that special someone in the late 90's in nyc epitomizes the frustrations, schemes and nuances that most single people deal with. These are the real people, in their everyday lives. The movie shots around nyc and people in their candid moments inside their apartments add to the realistic nature of this story. The music is a nice compliment to the movie. I just wish ""Falling Leaves"" by Coldcut was available in the U.S. It is a beautiful contemporary version of this classic song."
5,Fabulous Book!!,"This is a lovely photo cum text book about the underground hit movie, ""Unmade Beds."" Barker's photographic eye which is in dramatic evidence in the movie is also reflected in the book. The accompanying text of the character's lines from the film are pithy and hilarious. Highly recommended."
4,What the hell is Rockgrass??,"Ok... I am no fan of Bluegrass or Country or anything that might even contain the possibility of a banjo being in the same building, but I do like good old fashioned Rock music and I have a sense of humour. Hence, I love this album and the band that spawned it from their twisted sense of humour. AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Co played on a banjo and washboard - excellent stuff. The band sound like they are laughing at themselves as much as anything and actually prove to be quite a versatile and talented group. The album is let down somewhat by the last track ""Let the Circle be Unbroken"" and their own two compositions, ""Corn Liquor"" and ""I'm keeping your Poop"" don't entirely sit well among the other selections. An entertaining album all the same, and particular note goes to the renditions of ""Walk This Way"" and ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" which really tickled me.Buy it for fun, don't buy it for great rock or bluegrass."
4,Lots of fun High energy,If you like hard rockin rock and roll like AC/DC and you like Bluegrass-What are you waiting for? Great disc.
3,Smells great but many other products work better,"Yes, it smells great. I love the scent. However, I have used a lot of different shampoos and my hair looks better when I use Pantene or Frieda shampoos. I found that even the moisturizing formula of herbal essence was rather drying to my thick hair. Generally the more lather you get with a shampoo the more drying it is to your hair and that is what i found with this product. This brand keeps coming out with new formulas such as for colored hair or volumizing and I keep trying them because I love the scent and hope this one will be better but i have finally given up on Herbal Essence. They need to focus more on how improving their product's perfomance and less on creating new scents. That said, there are worse shampoos out there. White Rain is a good example."
3,Not a Marine Corps flag!,"Title says ""US Marines Flag..."". But the photo shows a flag with ""Special Forces"" printed on it. I think someone goofed..."
4,Awesome looks but I feel the material could have been a better quality,"Don't get me wrong I love the looks and size of this flag, but do to the type of material it is it pry isn't the typical flag you would want to hang every day outside for long periods of time, it's more of a flag to hang inside your home on the wall!"
5,Not Your Grandmother's Harp Music,"I love this recording! The combination of three beautiful voices in great harmony along with three electric harps also with beautiful ""voices"" and great harmonies is amazing. The style isn't ""old fashioned"" or ""new age""....they have a style of their own with heart and drive. There's nice percussion, keyboard, and guitar backing the group as well. I especially like the song ""Falling Angel"". The three harp arrangement is intricate and dramatic and Midyne Spear's lead vocal is lovely. Other stand out tracks are ""Light of Sound"", the totally instrumental ""Velocity of Love"", the hard driving ""Higher Ground"" (definately not your grandmother's harp music) and the beautiful Celtic sounding ""Through the Mist""."
1,Needs a lot of work to be good,"Being a celtic harper myself, I was quite interested to hear this CD. Unfortunately it was not nearly as good as i expected. Obviously their inspiration is Scottish harp duo Sileas. However, these three women do not come close to doing with three harps what sileas does with two. The songs are trite, their lyrics are lacking, their vocals are weak, and most of all, the harp playing is intermediate at best. The arrangements are extremely weak, They do not even attempt such electric harp techniques as bass imitations(which the electric harp is basically built for), syncopated rythms, or innovative sound effects. The idea is good, the potential is there, but the band needs a lot of work before I'd ever buy one of their albums again. If your looking for great harp groups , do stick with sileas ."
5,The only guide you'll need,"This nearly 500-page guide is one of the best I've seen on Colonial Williamsburg, Jamestown, Yorktown and the surrounding areas. Everything you need is here - info on many restaurants and types of lodging, shopping, nightlife, daytrips to James River plantations and other attractions, museums, golf, parks, and ""kidstuff"". A wide range of price options is shown to accommodate all vacation budgets - yes, you can still find a good, clean motel room for around $60! A section entitled ""Myths and Legends"" discusses the spookier side of Colonial Williamsburg's historic homes and a few plantations. Sections on neighborhoods, healthcare, education/childcare, and retirement options are here for the many smitten visitors who don't want to leave. Informative and fun to read, this guide also includes many b/w photos, five easy to read maps, insider tips, and a comprehensive index. Great book!"
1,An old battery is an old battery,"If you've got an old Thinkpad, don't imagine that you'll be able to extend the battery life by buying a new battery. They haven't been manufactured in so many years that even the pristine ones are pretty much dead. If this were 2000, then I'm sure I could give it a much better review, but if you're using a seven year old Thinkpad, then you should probably just stick to keeping it plugged into the wall. The battery might save you when the power blinks off, but don't expect to get more than a few minutes of work done."
1,Hate isn't a strong enough word for this styling product...,"Hate isn't a strong enough word for this styling product. My waves weren't free to move after using this product. Instead, they seemed to be stuck to each other rather than being defined and free to move on their own as they should. I also noticed that with this mousse, my waves fell limp quickly; they usually stya quite well with other products. Finally, my waves didn't from well around the first few inches my hair near the scalp. I don't know why this should be, but it was so with this product. I cannot think of any benefits os using this product. I was very dissatisfied with it."
1,must miss mousse,no lift with this mousse. my curls just sank with it. my advice is to not try this.
1,Poor Product,"I have tried this mousse many times and have not been satisfied once. To begin with, it doesn't provide any control at all. Also, it only curls the ends of my hair. The mousse also felt like it coated my hair, making my hair feel dirty. Last, the smell of this product is very bothersome. I can't think of anything positive about this mousse."
2,Vtech Cordless Phone,I am not sure if it was this phone or the model of the phone that has the flaws. The sound quality was terrible. I purchased this model to replace another similar Vtech telephone model that is no longer made. The vtech gz5838 did not meet my expectations. Save yourself the money and look for another telephone. I ended up having to purchase another telephone.
1,Wish I had returned it when I had the chance!,"I purchased this phone 4 months ago and within the first week the individualized ring feature for incoming calls quit working entirely. A seemingly minor glitch, but one I couldn't remedy by returning it because my other phone had died completely. I too noticed a lot of static on the line and after a few weeks I found my talk time getting shorter and shorter, in spite of fully discharging the battery every time before recharging it. At this point it seems like every couple of days, when I try to answer an incoming call I get that annoying ""beep"" in my ear and then have literally about 30 seconds to finish my conversation before it dies. I'm not giving Vtech another chance after this dud."
2,Well...,"I had this phone before and it died on me after about a year of light use, but i figured ""hey maybe its just this one"" after all its ring-tones where awesome and its appearance ideal, however less then 5 months after i purchased my new one it too died on me now im stuck with a broken phone and looking for a similar type because as i mentioned before it looks and sounds good, but if you get this phone it'll be like throwing out money and who wants that Prez Obama?"
5,Great deal,"I spent a good deal of time researching these brake rotors - including going to the various auto parts stores in our area - and these were far and away the best deal, and the best rotor for the price. I bought cheap ones the last time and they only lasted about 12 months before they warped badly. These, so far, are working flawlessly. And, as a side note, they were made in Canada, not China, if that matters to anyone."
3,Some Good Information,There is some very good information in this book but it is much to technical...more like a research project. It the type of book you may want to read if doing thesis.
1,Don't waste your money,"I've taught English for several years, stateside and overseas and I have seen many books that are much better. Find a 10 year old to draw the pictures for you. They will come out looking better!"
1,Total Rubbish,I bought these awhile ago because at the time the price was very reduced and on receiving and using the product I was utterly disappointed. These do not light up steadily and barely light up at all. it creates no effect whatsoever. Even if it is was free and still wouldn't recommend this product to anyone
1,Save your bikes,I bought this item from a local bike shop. They mounted it on the car showed us how to Strap the bike on. I did everthing they showed me! Driving down the Highway at 75 Mph Look up at the mirror in time to see my $640.00 bike fell off and Tumbled everywhere. Traffic swerving to avoid hitting it. My bike is Distroyed. Only had the bike for 33 days. Had the bike rack for less then a day.What I got out of it A broken bike and a useless bike rack!
1,AVOID THIS RACK IT HAS BEEN A DISASTER,"Do not purchase this rack if you are using it with a swept back car and a composite bike. While the rack remained fully attached to automobile, Cervelo carbon fiber triathlon bike went sailing across the highway when weak rubber mounting straps failed. Bike was completely destroyed. Manufacturer tries to limit liability to cost of rack and hides behind the fine print of a warranty statement that you get when filing a claim. This has been a complete disaster. If I could give it a negative review I would as I am currently experiencing a $3500.00 loss. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS RACK IF YOU HAVE A COUPE-TYPE VEHICLE AND A VERY LIGHT WEIGTH BIKE!"
5,Best bike rack I have ever owned!,"Having gone through many permutations of cars, I have owned 3-4 bike racks in my lifetime. This has been the best so far. It was EASY to put it on our Ford Escape. After some fussing with the straps, it attached quickly and easily. It took my about 20 minutes the first time, 10-15 the second time. And it was *solid*. I hated previous bike racks that would sway back and forth. Not this one. Loading the bikes on was easy. The bikes did not rub against one another, nor did a wheel/pedal scratch up my car. Great design....The arms that hold the bike fold up when not in use. Also could still open the hatch on the Ford Escape with the rack in place.Lastly, our local bike store showed us that tying a knot in the straps below the buckle actually would prevent any slipping of the buckle. Also helps deals with any flapping straps. Also showed us to use some extra strap to tie TO the bike, as an extra measure.Highly recommend this bike rack."
4,"""Alright"" dvd for J.J fans","This is a really long movie(novela?). Great picture quality, the acting was, well no comment. Not all the actors had the guayaquil dialect(coastal ecuadorian) though; kind of a wierd mix, you'll probably only notice if your from there though. I would have preferred if it were in documentary style though (Buena Vista). They used J.J's original recordings for this movie, the actor (a relative?)lip-syncs to the songs. My favourite part was the last 2 minutes. I bought this dvd because I am a big fan of J.J. Its a nice item to have in a collection.The price was in-keeping with the production value, good effort."
5,DAMN: EVERYBODY'S GOT A LITTLE GHETTO FLAVOR!!!,"Dr. Berry will even have your saddity Aunt Geraldine nodding and laughing in agreement to half of the descriptions in this book. Some of them are enough to make you fall out from laughter, crawl under a table in shame or cry tears of sympathy for those who are too ghetto for their own good. If you ain't got at least 10 of these traits, you're in denial, lying or both!!! ADMIT IT: WE'S ALL GHETTO Y'ALL!!!"
4,Side-splitting good fun!,"I have come online to purchase this book after reading a friend's copy. These snippets are just too funny, and I've got to have my own copy! Sometimes it's ""sad"" that some of the things are true, and I remember them from my own experiences. But laughing at oneself is the best sign of passage. Try it, you'll like it."
4,Its about time!,"I waited a long time to get this. The second season was not quite asgood as the first season, but it was still awesome!"
5,Holy Moly,A surprise a minute in this crazy release. Not for the casual viewer. I see this as the ideal product for the kind of person for whom the post viewing pick apart conversation is half the fun. There is just so much to speculate about. I absolutely loved it. I am amazed that this was prime time television. How on earth do you pitch a show like this? I am curious why the release is from CBS DVD when the show aired on ABC. Odd.
5,FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been waiting for this for sooooooooo long, it's almost unbelievable to think that I'll finally be able to sit with cherry pie and coffee (damn hot!) to enjoy all 2 seasons, and Fire walk with me, alltogether, marathon style! :-)Counting the days like Cartman waiting for Nintendo Wii!"
5,What is taking so long?,"I have the whole box set of Twin Peaks on VHS as well as the Pilot, Fire Walk with Me and the First Season on DVD. What is taking so long for the rest of the set to come out on DVD? There is no reason for it to take this long! There is a demand for this the whole set out there and it needs to be met. Forget just releasing the second season - release the whole damn thing - Now.I will buy it if it is there and pass my VHS set on to some one who will one day buy the DVD set. Does some one want my money out there? It's sitting right here for the taking - Act now and I might even throw in and extra five bucks.Hurry up people - time is a wasting."
5,COME ON ALREADY!!!!,They gave us Season 1 on DVD and it ruled!How many more years do we have to wait for Season 2????RELEASE SEASON 2 ALREADY!!
5,Amazing... Our patience and their slowness beggars belief.,"Don't you just love it?The product has thousands of eager buyers waiting for it with bated breath; it already has a sales rank although you cannot buy it, it has five stars and reviews by people who never saw it on DVD. And yet - for some reason - they would STILL not publish it.Hey, what is the matter? What are they waiting for? Is Season One not selling well? Yes it is; as a matter of fact, it's ranking is similar to DVD edition of ""The Hunt for Red October"" (just an example from the same year of original release).Let's hope we'll at least be able to have this for Christmas."
5,A new fan that is wanting more!,"I was only 6 when ""Twin Peaks,"" first aired on TV. I remember hearing alot about it, but not knowing what the ...it was about. Then, a friend of mine introduced me to the first season and I was hooked. I watched all 7 episode of the first season on DVD last night and I crave more.This second season, however they chose, needs to be released post-haist. I keep reading about Lodges and characters I know nothing about, and I'm salavating. So, please, Artisan Entertainment, HURRY!... - BOB"
5,Putting financial reasoning aside...,"Release Season 2 because without it, who knows where Television today would be. All of these hot, recent shows like LOST, and even The Sopranos to a great extent, are nothing if not greatly indebted to David Lynch's TV masterpiece, Twin Peaks. It should be every fan's right to own this on DVD, and would be an enormous privilege for any avid TV fan unfamiliar with the series. It's like Rhino records, re-issuing obscure albums by obscure bands like Television, simply because of their importance and influence. Twin Peaks is the same; it's entirely crucial, and regardless of the financial reprecussions, Paramount owes its release to interested consumers."
5,hold on guys,"It's been a wait last I heard the second is going tobe released around the end of December- the beginning of January.The studio that released the first one, Artisan will not be releasing the second one. Your gonna have to do your own research as to who is going to be releasing the second season because I forgot. I do remember them saying that they are working on the remastering... it's just been a problem with releasing rights, and whether it's court or just product adoption by another company, those kind of shifts take time, be patient... I'll have to be too."
5,Release season two!,"Please, give us all our pain and sorrow and release the second season. The fans deserve that much at least."
5,Best TV Series,"What else can be said about this cult classic? I discovered it later, but my mother was a devoted fan. Before she died we shared the 1st season together, and it was a memory I will never forget. Unfortunately, the 2nd Season was after her death, but as I had not seen the original, it was all new to me, and I'm even more impressed with Lynch than I already was. Enough has been said; books could be written, but what a grand result of Lynch's transcendental meditation! I never tire of watching it, and find nuances with every view. Humor, pathos, quirky, great acting, and of course scenery. I visited the area in Washington where it was shot; beautiful, but as in the series, lots of unemployment. A metaphor for Lynch. Beautiful on the outside, less so the further you look. Thank you for the 2nd Season much waited for!"
5,It Always Happens,"TWIN PEAKS******Please hurry and bring out season 2, with All the episodes that were made. Also the series PILOT. As an avid fan of Twin Peaks, I thought it gave a little depth to TV where a person could just sit down and watch glued to thier seats, waiting for the next episode. Talk about suspense. This was one of the best shows. The opening was of beautiful mountains and the music was great. I even bought the Twin Peaks CD soundtrack when it came out. It never fails. When ever TV puts a series on that grabbs the people it gets dropped because of the ratings. Well try putting the little black boxes in homes where we appreciate good TV. Its not fair that EVERYONE doesn't get a vote in what we enjoy seeing."
5,At Last,"It's been a long time since I first the show on tv, and finally I got it. This DVD edition is awesome, not as good as the first season (not sop many extras), but it's pretty good anyway. Best television show ever, and an excellent transfer from the original, as all the others lynch movies."
3,Erratic,"I was a huge Twin Peaks fan after the first season, but did'nt like the second season as mutch. In and between it keeps the style and excitement from the first season. Can also maybe blame myself abit, since I peek'ed ""fire walk with me"" before the last season."
2,Twin Peaks The Second Season,"Too much to take in here. The Mystery remains however, and David Lynch doesn't let us down. Lots of imagery and metaphore, the last scenes for the season are over egged, and I felt that I was being taken for a ride. One has to view the whole thing again, and I cannot help feeling that something is missing, someone seems bored with the concept, thus leaving only die hard Lynch fans burning the midnight oil."
5,The Second Season at Last,"If you are a fan of Twin Peaks, then there is nothing more to say. It is one of the most visually appealing TV shows ever put to celluloid. It does well in digital with this release and should provide years of viewing pleasure. It's a record of TV's brief excursion into something more that the dim witted and banal. It lacks the background material found in Season One, but who really gives a toss about that?"
4,Twin Peaks--why did it have to end!,"I will forever buy the latest format version of Twin Peaks.....although second season was not as great as the first, it has some truly gem lynchy moments.....now on to buy the blu ray version......"
5,Perfect * Just What We Needed !!!,"Fans, please stop whining about the packaging. It's absolutely fine. What did you want -- multi-fold binding with 14k gold inlay and personally signed by David Lynch? I think we Twin Peaks fans have been waiting so long for this release and perhaps we were just expecting the red carpet treatment. Not necessary. It's no different and just as appropriate as all the other packagings out there. Perhaps the Complete Mystery Set will satisfy your packaging needs. The DVDs are perfect. Perfect Picture. Perfect Sound. Nice Extras! That's all that should matter. Rejoyce and Be Happy!!!"
2,The Season that Should Not Have Been,"Twin Peaks should have been a mini-series, perhaps 6-8 hours total. The longer it went on, the more absurd it became (and not in the cool way it already was). I remember watching the two hour season opener after the nail-biting cliffhanger and being completely deflated. Supporting characters in all their quirks rose to the fore, Lynch himself appeared as a caricature of his straight-arrow leading man and the focus on solving Laura Palmer's murder diffused into the vapor. Biggest. Letdown. Ever."
3,Wait for COMPLETE BOXSET...!!!,"Just a heads up for everyone out there that might not know: This second season release is for those who bought the Season One set way back when (such as myself). However, there is also a 'Twin Peaks' boxset in the works that's going to be released a little later that will contain both Season 1 & 2, plus the original pilot episode that wasn't included with the first Season One set (what was up with that anyways?!?!?) Something to keep in mind, although I'm sure most hardcore Twin Peaks fans will buy both - I'm sure Paramount is counting on it, actually. Don't be suckered!!!"
4,great and diffrent,david lynch and sherilyn fenn and a great script what more do you need/ i was moved when i saw the end of episode fifteen i almost cried actually and of course the rest of the cast were perfict the entire show should have went on longer than it did and its to bad the ms.fenn didint get the movie star fame she deserves she was hot as audrey horne and her acting is better than demi moores.
5,A Supernatural Work Of Art,"In my opinion, one of the best television series of all time. On a whim, I bought the first season on DVD. After watching it, got the second season without hesitation. The series follows Dale Cooper trying to solve the murder of Laura Palmer. The creator, David Lynch, does an excellent job portraying the events of the story as well as holding an artistic perspective on the lives of the characters in the series. The best part about the conclusion of the series is that it puts itself into a class all by itself in regards to theatrical development. This makes Twin Peaks a one of a kind series that no other has come close to matching in Hollywood. Beware, it will make you think, and you'll want to watch the show more than once to catch everything that happens."
4,"left in the Black Lodge, hidden under a red curtain?","I wish it were clear to whichever execs are responsible for deciding whether to release this that TP fans are both numerous and rabid. I'm not sure how Amazon ranks titles that haven't even been released, but...this nonexistent title is ""outselling"" a number of actually existing items here at Amazon.My guess is: if it actually existed, it would sell better. We'll have to consult physicists and philosophers on that claim, but I think it's true.Sheesh - there is an audience for ""failed"" TV shows - I mean, if _Harsh Realm_ can be released, surely TP2 can!(While we're at it: lawyers please straighten up the mess so a nice, cleaned-up version of the pilot can be available. The HK version is...fuzzy.)"
1,Survival Basics I & II The Adventure,"Some of the demonstrations given in the two videos was useful and could be life saving, and ofcourse that's the main point, but the quality of these obviously home-made tapes made them hard to watch. They were very grainey and it was necessary to keep adjusting the tracking. The presenter spoke in monotone and was simply boring. There are probably other tapes done more professionally that provide the same information. A warning is given at the beginning of Video II that it contains graphic pictures. Yes it does, and they are sickening. You definitely do not want children to watch Video II. I suggest you look elsewhere."
4,Great for Learning Scriptures to Assist with Biblical Counseling,This was a selected book needed for coursework. It's a great resource and can be used as a form of Bible Study!
2,not who you might think,"I bought this expecting the band who released an eponymous album (1st track: Who do you Love?) and a second one called COARSE earlier in the 90s. Alas, it's not them - this single is by a hardcore band. Pretty mediocre as hardcore goes."
4,Great Place to Start!,"I remember when the Tae-Bo craze came out but I never did buy the tapes. I figured it would be like every other exercise gizmo or fad that I would use for about 2 weeks and then give up and it would become another dust collector in my house. Recently, I quit smoking and have been putting on the weight. I decided it was time to get in shape. This DVD was my first purchase and I love it. The only reason I gave it only four stars is because I wish it had more cardio on it. The instructional video is actually longer than the workout but essential in learning the moves. The workout is about 26 minutes with about 15 minutes of actual heart pounding aerobics. I bought another workout video and it was so confusing I could hardly keep up. I have to admit Billy Blanks is a great motivator and I enjoy his workouts. As a matter of fact, I just ordered another workout of his and plan to buy his new Fat Blasting series in March."
5,New fans of Storyhill,"We are new fans of Storyhill having heard them on the Prairie Home Companion show. We first bought ""In the Shade of the Trees"" having loved that song when they performed it on PHC. Then purchased the self titled ""Storyhill"" cd along with ""Duotones"" for Christmas. We absolutely love listening to these 3 cds on our ride up to Maine from our Massachusetts home. Their voices blend so well and the lyrics and melodies are so beautiful. Would highly recommend these two performers to anyone. So glad we found them! Every time I take out the cd when it finishes I say to my husband, ""I just love those guys!"""
5,great product,"Tried other brands and the straps are much too short-an issue when the shoulder straps are already at their longest position and pulling in the straps further makes the straps feel shorter and renders the bra unwearable-I just needed something to keep my bra straps from falling off my shoulders when wearing tanks. This product includes two straps, one long and one shorter if you need to make your bra straps more like a racer back style. Once you position the strap you can wash the bra with the strap on and never have to reposition it(the longer version). To put the bra on you just pull it over your head like you would a t- shirt."
1,too slippery,The width is adjustable but the strap loosens off more and more as the day goes on - so it is useless. It is made of a slippery material that just slips back through the adjuster buckles.
1,Good Idea - Bad Design!,"I thought this was going to be the perfect answer! But no! How the heck do you get the strap holder around the second strap without someone else to do it for you?? Sorry folks, it just doesn't work! Don't waste your money on this product!"
2,Strap Connection,The concept is great but it is extremely difficult to use it if you are alone. You must have a second person to help.
3,Just one problem,"The product itself is fine and does the job as described and expected. But if you have arthritis in your shoulders or some other impediment to arm flexibility, it is nearly impossible to use this unless you wear a front closure bra or have someone to hook your back closure bra."
2,works if you can stand it,"This works okay if you can get someone else to put it on for you. The problems with putting it on yourself are that you can hardly get your arms through the straps when it is on, and it gets hopelessly tangled if you can get your arms through. It is not very comfortable, and can be visable with the wrong shirt. (You have to wear it fairly high up for it to do its job.) But it does work if you can stand it."
3,FIRST TIME CUSTOMER.,I WAS A LITTLE PUT OUT BY THE SIZE OF THE DECOY. EXPECTED IT TO BE A LITTLE BIGGER.PRICE WAS EXCESSIVE FOR THE SIZE & THE METERALS USED TO MAKE IT.SHIPPING WAS VERRY HIGH SEEING THAT THE 2 DECOYS I ORDERED WERE SHIPPED IN THE SAME CARTON.& WERE VERRY LIGHT WEIGHT.HAD TO PAY 2 SHIPPING CHARGES.NOT GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!
2,enviar transducer standar please,"I need that you send the transducer to me of the apparatus to fisfinder 400c because thus does not serve to me don't mention it buys, it complete and they send it incomplete"
5,Truly Inspirational!,"Making the Impossible Possible is truly inspiring! Jason's powerful techniques taught me how to better define my goals in life and how to chart the course to acheiving them. This book has increased my self confidence. With Jason's help, I've taken a giant leap forward in both my personal and professional life."
4,My wife looked sexy in this.,"It is pretty cheap, but it looks nice and it is soft. I was happy that my wife decided they were so comfortable, she would just wear them to bed instead of PJ's."
4,Decent Tool Stand,This is a decent tool stand. I bought it to use with a Delta Midi lathe. I bolted a heavy 1 & 1/2 inch particle board & laminate top to it which gave the whole thing a lot more mass. It is tough to get the unit to sit level without having leveling feet. I also bolted a heavy duty drawer to the bottom of the unit and I think that is when the whole thing went slightly out of square giving me a little tilt when the unit sits on the floor. A thin piece of shim stock fixed the problem quickly. The metal of the stand is not exactly heavy but sturdy enough so the unit doesn't move when operating the lathe. The lathe stand costs in the neighborhood of $175 so this turned out to be a much better alternative.
4,Good Product Just Misses Great,"Arrived fast. Packaging looked like it had fallen off the back of the truck - doesn't everything from Amazon - but item was intact and complete. Table is well designed and sturdy. Holds my DeWalt surface planer very nicely. Only complaint is the hardware; I would have preferred hex head screws rather than the phillips head. And I am no fan of nylon insert locknuts. Other than little BS like that, a good product and good value."
4,HTC HTT-31 Tool Table,"Well designed. Parts are precision made. I had hoped for more rigidity; that is, the table distorts when loaded horizontally despite my having tightened all the bolts connecting legs to horizontal members. I also reinforced the top and the shelf as I'm using it to support a cast iron jointer and the associated electric motor. I may add a cross piece or two. Good purchase, all in all, despite these things."
4,Agree with everyone else - it's great,"What I particularly like about this book is it's 'real world' feel - Logic Pro has vast functionality, but the author hones in on a few fairly simple ways of doing things, as opposed to going through every feature. I would like to have seen more emphasis on mixing/production, but that's minor - this book can't be everything.My only beef with with the book is the banal tracks you use with the tutorial. If you are into that kind of go-nowhere take-yourself-too-seriously rockpop that hasn't changed in three decades, fine - but this sort of music doesn't show off Logic's major differentiator - it's synths and the newer styles of music that use them."
4,"Teach us teachers, Mrs. K!","This book was very helpful to me as I developed a Writing Lab curriculum for 7th and 8th graders. The author gives a lot of insight about how to motivate and create rapport with reluctant writers. She serves as an example on how to make this type of student feel successful in an environment where he often faces nothing but failure. The advice on how to guide students to take ownership of their work and develop writing pieces of their own design was also helpful. Perhaps what I liked best was the honesty with which the book was written. The author never claims to ""know it all"", and shares many stories of her disappointments and failures."
4,Knight sabers and Votom?,"first of all the person who put this together either does not know wat they are doing and doesnt care or they just plainly dont care and is just hoping to make some extra cash!! Because 1st the figure that is on display is from a totally different anime from the equipment that is being sold with it. The figure is named ""Priss"" from the anime ""Bubblegum Crisis"" and the equipment is not and i repeat NOT from the same anime nor will the equipment be compatable with figure. But from a collectors point of view it is a good buy because of who the figure is. You cant find ""Priss"" easily!!"
5,Works great but not as easy to install!,"I gave this a 4 star due to the amount of labor to install. It works great, lifts my minivan right up and keeps it nice and stable when hauling a trailer. However, I will still need a stabilizer bar to reduce sway.Installation was not as easy as I had thought but that was based on some Youtube videos I had found saying each bladder could be inserted through the spring gaps. The instructions that came in the package had me lowering the rear axle, removing the springs and drilling 3/4"" holes through the bottom plate under the springs. This allows for the air lines to be ran without worrying about them getting pinched in the springs. I did not have a 3/4"" drill bit, the largest metal bit I own is a 1/2"" so I used that. It seems to be working fine.I've had them installed for about 2 months now and I've used them several times. Whether its towing my pop up camper or hauling 8 people in my minivan, it has worked above and beyond my expectations."
3,I WAS THERE,"I was at the Texas Jamm that night when Areosmith came on right after Ted Nugent i think. Its still hazy and I think it was 2am Sunday morning.this video is a truly nice piece of the past for me. I think the promoters lost a million dollars on the show , but it was heaven for the fans,"
2,view only if you are a drug addict!!!,"Well the "" greatest american rock n' roll band "", was pretty lousy in this video. I guess when you think your mic stand is a crutch I can see why. This video would be an excellent commercial for ""Don't use Drugs"", one look at the pathetic state of the toxic twins would hopefully make someone see the light."
5,Big ones,"The video is almost the best video from Aerosmith. You have all include: concerts, studio, at the Simpsons, musik videos and many more. Steven is very sexy and he had a great voice. The other guys were also very good. But one thing is not so good: the video PINK (my favourite) is not include. All in all the video is perfect and it is for anyone. your Annekathrin"
3,Mixed emotions...,"On the other hand, this video represents Aerosmith at their jamming and grooving best from the 70's. This would qualify for a 5 star rating. Sadly, I'll have to subtract a couple because of mr. Tyler's condition (he forgets/screws up lyrics, his voice breaks, and he yells out the wrong guitarists name during a solo).Still, interesting and entertaining, and I shouldn't complain about performers conditions... I'm a Johnny Thunders fan."
3,Joe's guitar is not always on.,"If you listen to some songs his guitar is turned down. When I read the book ""Walk This Way"" it mentions that during the concert Joe was so high he couldn't play the songs. In particular if you listen to ""Walk This Way"" the sound board man turned him off and The keyboardest played his part on the keyboard during the verses."
5,This Film Shot Me Through the Heart!!!,"For the plotline in a nutshell, I am quoting the ""Product Description"" as shown on the Amazon Webpage for this film. Here it is...""Two friends, each champion marksmen, are on opposite sides in war. One turns sniper for the enemy. One remains their town's last line of defense. In a terrible battle for power, two best friends must pull the trigger. Only one will feel the bullet - but both will feel the pain.""I was totally blown-away by the writing, the set design and especially by all the Actors. Linus Roache is always a favorite of mine. I have never been disappointed in any role he's played. Vincent Perez gave a slam-bang performance. Every cast member was absolutely perfect!Saying ""Goodbye"" to a friend is always a difficult thing to do, let alone how the ""Goodbye"" was delivered takes the finale right up and over the mountain.WOW! What a fantastic film. I am very impressed."
4,Almost excellent,"This is a great film about the battle in Sarajevo in the 90's. HBO did a great job with one minor flaw. If you have the original version of the movie, there is one scene where the DVD, was edited for some reason, and they took out like 2 bad words, which to me really had their place and meaning in that particular scene. It is rather comical to see the actor mouth out something other than what you hear. All-in-all a great buy and an excellent film."
3,good film worth 5 bucks,"set in Bosnia. 2 friends, one an olympic standard sharp shooter end up on opposite sides. Nice look at Bosnia war. Interesting characters and ending."
2,Not so good,"This movie didn't really portray the war as I had hoped because in Bosnia the Croats,Muslims, and Serbs didn't get along like they portrayed in the beggining of the movie. You couldn't just walk around on the street like they did. Also there was no way that the muslim guy could have gotten to the serb so quickly. It didn't really show the war like what happened. If you weren't there you might think it portrayed the war very well but it didn't. Its just another american film portraying something that didn't happen that way at all."
3,Not exactly accurate,I watched this film in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) with a Bosnian who lived through the 1992-1995 war (mother is Muslim and father is Serb). He could not stand the film because he said it is not realistic. The interior sets approximate how people lived in BiH before the war but are much too high class and more like a Californian version of the BiH. BiH is much more complicated and complex than this film portrays. The film is an interesting and entertaining approximation that gets across the point that war is a horrible thing and in the end utterly pointless.
5,Torn by the heart ...,"Two boys grow up as childhood best buddies in Sarajevo. Later they mutually develop marksmanship skills. Both become sniper/assasins in war-torn dysfunctional Yugoslavia. Each must pick sides in the conflict. Ultimately each becomes the target in the others crosshairs ... BANG! A simple movie depictng basic human decisions and dynamics, done extremely well. Great ending!"
3,Shot through the heart,"Obviously, not a high budget movie.Didn't really do the original true story-line justice .... and it was possible . Very weak ending. But still an entertaining movie."
2,are New Englanders all this mean?,Not my cup of tea because there wasn't one single likeable character. Everybody is so mean and nasty. It didn't seen real.
5,Mister Ed,"Ordered through amazon, but purchased this book from USED@BNEW in Lubbock TX. This book was ordered on Monday and was in my mail box on Wednesday. Hard to believe the quick delevery time from Texas to South Carolina. Apparently Barbara watches her business very closely and takes it seriously. Book was as advertised and came sealed protective wrapper before it was ever put in a mailer. I will use them again and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a used book."
1,Train Wreck!,"Can you give negative stars? About 1/2 way through the book I wanted to toss it in the garbage because it was very hard to follow & completely unrealistic. However, I managed to finish it thinking that it HAD to get better. Believe it or not, the ending is even worse. Don't waste your time! (PS, loved the Nanny Diaries though)"
1,Don't Waste The Gas Money,to even go rent this from the library. It's that bad. I can't put into words how bad...those words don't exist!
2,2 Stars Because I Like the Cover,"Buying this book was my attempt at trying something new. I've never read the Nanny Diaries, heard the buzz about it, and figured, ""why not give this one a try?"" Big mistake!Citizen Girl's main character is a 20 something that doesn't really seem to have much in the common sense/social skills department. The authors introduce new characters in the most awkward way and character dialogue is vague and all over the map.If anyone is considering purchasing this book, please read all of the reviews first."
3,A bitter pill...,"Citizen girl was smart, brash, and often funny. However, like the Nanny Diaries before it, there was little justice in the story. I loved the character of Girl. But every other character she encountered represented the worst of humanity. It almost became unbelievable how cold and mean the other characters were. However, this made me root for her even more. But this soon became emotionally exhausting. Girl was the only reason I finished this book and the big satisfying ending I was hoping for was no where to be found."
1,Pure Drivel.....,"I hated this book!! Having read (and enjoyed) the authors first book, I had great expectations for this one. The plot (albeit typical chick lit) seemed good but that is where the good ended. I hated the fact that the main character was named ""Girl"" and that the main male characters in the book were named ""Buster"" and ""Guy"". Please! It's no wonder young women today have identity issues. Now, I understand why the character had no real name - I realize that the authors wanted women to identify with her - to show her as an ""every woman"" but it was just awful. Girl was a very weak character. She can't stand up to anyone really and waffles around life. Her 14 year old brother Jack had more oopmh to him! I just didn't get where this story was going so I jumped book about 80 pages or so in. I wouldn't recommend it as even a library read. Save your time, money, and fuel by not even making an effort to read it. If I could give it no stars then I would."
3,That's It?,"The second book by these authors lacked much of what the first book did, content mainly. Up until the last 50 to 75 pages, I still found myself questioning what this book was about. I was thoroughly confused. Also, I felt like the F word was overutilized; I am sure they were trying to make a point; however, being the literary scholars they are, you think they could have used the thesaurus a little more. And the end, what happened to the end? I was like, is that it, it's over. It was as if they got tired of writing and boom, typing over and pen down. Who cares if there is closure. I finished it because I have to, if I start it I have to finish. But I would not recommend it to my other booky friends."
1,So. Not. Good.,"This book was a major disappointment. I read it with high hopes, as I LOVED The Nanny Diaries (I read it twice). The characters are annoying. Even their names are annoying ( I mean, ""Girl""? Come on!). The plot is weak yet confusing. I think this is the only book that I actually stopped reading about three quarters of the way through it. I stopped reading feeling, not curious about what happens to Girl, but annoyed that I wasted so much time reading this book in the first place."
1,DON'T waste your time.....,"You don't have to take my advice, within the first chapter you will realize what a waste of ink and paper this ""novel"" is. The plot starts out somewhat promising, but falters -QUICKLY- to a less than acceptable read. Plot and characters are weak at best. The most satisfying part of the book was the end.....it was finally over!"
2,Dumb on so many levels,"Like many others, I have read ""The Nanny Diaries"", twice, and I own it. ""Citizen Girl"" came from the library and it was just dumb. I'm so over the generic character names, and frankly Girl's relationship with Buster was just outright depressing. If that's what I have to look forward to, then I'll just be a hermit, thank you very much. Also, there were so many opportunities where if Girl would have actually grown a backbone, I could have rooted for her. But thank God she couldn't compromise her values enough to work for a porn company! She still holds true to feminist values!!! (Sarcasm dripping.) For better chick lit, try ""The Devil Wears Prada"", or things by Candace Bushnell."
2,Not my favorite book,"I just finished ""Citizen Girl"" and it is certainly not a keeper. I keep really good books to reread and this certainly isn't one of them. The story was interesting enough but many of the situations were nebulous and I was unsure of what the book was trying to say. I was glad Girl quit her job because that showed she was true to her beliefs, but I still couldn't figure out whether or not she and Buster stayed together. I thought he really liked her but in the end their values were different and they split (or at least I think that is what happened.) I think this is a novel you will either love or hate."
3,I really wanted to like it...but,"I LOVED The Nanny Diaries. LOVED IT! I wanted to love this book, I really tried to love this book. I just couldn't. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I really couldn't feel connected with Girl, or the other characters, in any way. The dialogue is fairly witty and the story was creative enough to keep me reading til the end, but the ending was so abrupt it left me sitting in my bed thinking that someone must have stolen the last couple of chapters out of my book. It didn't wrap anything up, just left me hanging. Keep at it Nicola and Emma, I really do like your style...I'm just not a fan of Girl's."
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping for a Bridget Jones like funny and smart novel, and instead I got a hard to understand dry story that I had to force myself to finish, if only for the fact that I wanted to figure out what the hell ""Girl"" did at her job! The ending was totally stupid and abrupt and did not even flow with the rest of the story. Read Bridget Jones again instead of wasting time on this!"
2,Dissapointed,"I couldn't follow the story line. I'm not sure if it just bored me so much that I skimmed past anything meaningful. I just didn't get where it was going. No plot, no significant character devolpment. A real shame as I was looking forward to it so much. Maybe that was the problem."
1,Not a good read for me,"This book is awful! I thought calling the lead character Girl, the boss Guy, and the company My Company was both annoying and distracting. After reading 105 pages, I give up."
1,"stupid, stupid, stupid",This has got to be the stupidest book I have ever read. Total mishmash of idiocy. Don't waste your money.
2,Trite,"I listened to the audio version of this book. From the beginning, my attention was captured. I was Girl. I have worked for bosses like ""Doris"". I could relate to Girl's, horrible, first job out of college. But as the book continues on, Girl's situations and opportunities broaden, but her perspective does not, she does not. I found the book mildly entertaining, only for it being a traumatic experince I could relate to. After the 5th chapter the story dwindled."
3,Not as good as Nanny Diaries,"I am a twentysomething new professional, and I can identify with many of the situations portrayed in the book, so I did enjoy seeing the main character's story unfold. The use of ""Girl"" and ""Guy"" and ""My Company"" as names in the book was quite cumbersome, though - annoying to the point that I almost quit reading the book. It was as though the authors were trying to make the situation and the characters so generic and so stereotypical that there wasn't any depth left, just flat stereotypes. The company and Girl's job finally started making sense during the last third of the book; otherwise, I would never have made it through. Overall, after having read The Nanny Diaries (which I definitely enjoyed), this book was a disappointment."
1,"Loved Nanny Diaries, Loathed Citizen Girl","The Nanny Diaries is my favorite book, and I've been waiting with baited breath for these two to write another one together. I was SO disappointed. The sharp wit and style that they are known for with Nanny was lost in Citizen Girl bc of the gratuitous swearing and bizarre sexual scenes. It could not be more obvious that they wrote this book with a different voice, one that says ""if we say &%$@ every other line, it'll sound cool and edgy"". They clearly fell into the trap of wanting to shock us and all they did was fall to the bottom of the chick lit pile. I was so disappointed and I really hope they read these reviews and bang out another nanny diaries super star again.Ladies, if you are reading this. . .go back to your old style! We need a Nanny Diaries sequel! :)"
1,Waste of Money,"I too was excited to read Citizen Girl because I LOVED The Nanny Diaries. However, after reading the book I was really disgusted, disappointed and appalled that this was allowed to be published. There are too many things to list that are wrong with this book-other reviewers have pointed out some.. The very worst and the ultimate low point of the book comes when Girl's boyfriend does an unmentionable thing to her and she accepts his apology for it. Was it even necessary to include that scene?? NO. Really horrifying in general. Don't waste your money."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I read this book for the simple reason that I liked ""The Nanny Diaries"" and figured that it would be worth the read, even if it wasn't quite as good. I was tremendously incorrect. I don't know how this book even got published. The bland names, ""Girl"" ""Guy"", etc, made the characters far too one dimensional for me to become invested in the story. Also, there were a lot of elements that simply didn't fit into the story and were too over the top. The funny thing is, the over the top elements were incredible uninteresting and so they didn't even add excitement to the storyline. The sole reason that I kept reading the book to the end was that I had myself convinced that the story was gonna pick up and get exciting ""any page now."" That simply didn't happen. What a huge disappointment. The authors, their agent, their editor and their publisher were sorely misguided on this one."
1,So annoyning!,"What a disappointment! I enjoyed reading the Nanny Diaries and couldn't really believe that this book was written by the same authors. I didn't like the naive heroine of the book, didn't like the story loaded with stereotypes and easy to predict. Forget about the language that is used! Sometimes I thought I woukd read the first writing attempt of a teenager. I had a tough time to get to page 120. I usually try to read every book to the end - couldn't do it here.I regret the time and money wasted on this book."
3,If Only This Book Were Their First Novel,"By the end of Citizen Girl, I thought ""This isn't a bad first novel."" The problem is that Citizen Girl isn't McLaughlin & Krauss' first book. That book had an emotional rawness that left the reader believing the authors had lived the experiences depicted in its pages (thus making the ""diary"" part of that book's title extremely relevant). With Citizen Girl, that deep emotional connection is missing. Thus, the book seems like it was written by someone relaying second hand information instead of a personal experience.There are some qualities in Citizen Girl that make it worth merit. McLaughlin & Krauss' sharp wit is still present (albeit infrequently), as is their empathy for the difficulties faced by women in today's society. But, without the emotional immediacy that made their first novel so memorable, Citizen Girl is far below what McLaughlin & Krauss are capable of producing."
2,Even if you loved the Nanny Diaries....skip this one,"I absolutely LOVED The Nanny Diaries and was thrilled to hear that Citizen Girl was coming out by the same authors. I bought the book and started reading, expecting great things...and was thoroughly disappointed. The plot is boring, the style of writing is suited more toward a younger crowd (15-17), and I found myself sitting there going, ""This is ridiculous; this would NEVER happen in real life."" So as excited as I was to read this book, the purchase wasn't worth it. Oh well...at least one of their novels is a keeper!"
2,Depressing,"I was thrilled to get my hands on this book after reading The Nanny Diaries, but I knew within a few pages of starting Citizen Girl that this book was different. In a bad way.""Girl"", the main character, ends one bad job, suffers a bout of unemployment, and then ends up working for a man oh-so-cleverly named ""Guy"" at the equally ambiguously named company ""My Company."" Her escapades at this job take up the majority of this book, as do her relationship with her boyfriend ""Buster"" that ends up in some type of weird S&M; sex scene complete with Girl being tied up and nearly unconsciously drunk. Her job at My Company ends up being sexually perverse as well, leaving you with a sick feeling in your stomach and wondering what goes on in these two writers lives.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book. It's depressing, twisted, and doesn't give you the interesting look inside the lives of the New York elite that the Nanny Diaries did. Don't waste you time."
2,Did I actually finish this book?,"I LOVED the Nanny Diaries so when I saw a new book by the same authors I couldn't wait to get it. WOW, I had to force myself to finish this book. Actually, I just skimmed the ending because I thought this book was so bad. It was drawn out and I kept thinking, get to the point. I couldn't stand that the main characters name was ""Girl"" either. I could see ""Nanny"" for the Nanny in the other book, but Girl just did not work. Nor did My Company. It was annoying. The only part I did like about the book was Buster. He was the only thing that seemed somewhat real. Otherwise, I wasted my time reading this."
1,Disappointed,I loved the Nanny Diaries and bought CG under the assumption it would be as sharp and witty. Totally disappointed. Not until the final sentence does the books message come out and even then it has been preceded by so much waffle that I no longer care. So many characters come and go but none of them have been developed to a point where the reader can care about them.I suggest you read the last line of the book and then put it back on the shelf and buy another one. As a well read person this is something i would never normally even consider but this book was tripe.I'm sorry to be writing this as i had really hoped the girls wold strike gold again.
2,Glad I'm not a twenty-something anymore,"I liked Girl's character and I thought Buster was cute but Girl's workplace and boss(es) were like a bad dream where you realize you've forgotten to study for a final. It made me so happy (and relieved) a. to be 48 yrs old and b. to have majored in Nursing in college where from the first second of my first job and my first patient I knew (in theory anyway) what I had to accomplish at work. Because I am so removed from a corporate life in NYC from a twenty-something (or any!) perspective I was definitely a voyeur-reader. The book made me a little dizzy though and at the end I'm not even sure what I finished.(or why!)Satire or not, the book was essentially shallow and the writing, well, (purposefully?) weak. I'm not sure but I think that was the point and perhaps it backfired on the authors."
1,So disappointed!,"I had to read this for my book club, and I too loved the Nanny Diaries, so I was really looking forward to this one. I would never have guessed it was written by the same authors. Poor storyline, too much ""f-word"", and a disappointing ending.I won't be waiting for their next book. Skip this one!"
2,(Sigh) and Nanny Diaries was so good...,I loved The Nanny Diaries and was so excited for thier latest novel that I bought it in hard cover...and....it blew. It didn't make any sense and it wasn't funny at all. Girl was not a likable character and the story just kind of went nowhere. What a bitter dissapointment.
1,Gratuitous vulgarity,"I understand that Krauss and McLaughlin were trying to make some sort of point by filling this book with four letter words and pornographic images, I just can't for the life of me figure out what it was. What might have been effective if used properly comes across as gratuitous and offensive. The book might not have been better written if the vulgarities had been reduced, but at least I wouldn't have cringed as much as I did while reading it. You can't take a boring, ridiculous plot, infuse it with swear words and images meant to be ""edgy,"" and call it a good book. Citizen Girl fails even to be entertaining. While I see other reviewers (friends of the authors, perhaps?) straining to explain the plot and the reasons why we women in our twenties who work in offices should like this book, it simply doesn't work. Citizen Girl is a poorly conceived, crude waste of time."
1,I Dunno.,"I've never read this book but based on what everyone else has said, I, too, would like to join the club and give this book a poor review. It looks terrible! The cover is vapid and unimaginitive. Maybe there are words spelled wrong. I dunno. But I hated the reviews of this book. Bad, bad, book."
1,la la la boring,"I started reading it and just could not get into it. I returned it.I loved The Nanny Diaries and thought this would be a great book. Guess not. And the whole thing about having the main character named Girl is a stupid idea. It worked calling the nanny Nanny, but not for this book.Maybe their next book will be worthy of reading the whole thing."
1,disappointing,"The only thing worse than working at a boring job is reading about someone else's boring job. The book focused too much on the details of Girl's work assignments, which were dull and confusing (even SHE didn't know what she was supposed to be doing). I would rather have liked the focus to be on inter-personal relationships and such. Overall, the book was boring, bland, and too vulgar."
3,Good Enough,"After reading The Nanny Diaries, I was thrilled that Kraus and McLaughlin had teamed up to write another book. While the second book is entertaining, it is certainly not the showstopper that the first one was.Girl is a fairly typical 20-something trying to live the single girl life. Her adventures through modern HR are very humorous at times, as any recent college grad can attest. However, the characters seem a bit dull (particularly her ""boyfriend"") and not all that memorable. There is no real synthesis and the book, as many other reviewers have pointed out, seems a bit disjointed in places.Overall, the book is funny and an entertaining weekend read. Just don't get your hopes up too high."
1,Citizen Girl,"Worst book I ever tried to read. What a disappointment! Plan to throw it away, unfinished. A waste of time. Not worthy of the 1 star I was forced to input."
1,So disappointing,"The whole time I was reading this book I was really annoyed. I couldn't stand the character, she really bothered me. It seemed like everything in the book was negative, except for Buster, who actually had something good to say. I just did not like this book, at all. It felt like an itch I couldn't scratch. I would not recommend it."
2,not what I expected,"I bought the book because I wanted to have a nice refreshing read just like what I had with TND. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected, there was lack of coherence in the issues discussed and I just thought it was extremely far from reality as opposed to TND's close resemblance to the Upper East Side culture. It was not that bad though, i believe that it conveyed it's message to the twentysomethings hoping to make it big in the corporate world, although in the most extreme negative type of way, not leaving anything to be happy or at least hopeful about."
1,Don't waste any time on this one,"I made the mistake of picking up Citizen Girl, thinking it had to be good since I enjoyed the Nanny Diaries. Although I can find some redeeming qualities in most books I read, I could find none here, besides being short (and therefore over faster). The story has a disjointed feel and an overall dark mood. Almost all of the characters are totally unlikeable, including the main character, Girl. Also, the language, and many parts of the book, are unnecessarily crass-- it's as if the authors hope to inject some humor into the story through crudness, although this plan fails miserably.Hopefully I've made my point--pass this one by. There are plenty of other books in this genre, so pick up one of those instead."
2,Big disappointment,"Don't waste your time unless you are a 25 year old professional woman living in NYC. That's the only way you'll enjoy this book, by RELATING to it. Even I, who was once a girl in a similar position to ""Girl,"" the main character in the book, only found it fleetingly entertaining when I could reminisce about similar professional experiences. But, I could not relate to the character, who I found to be an idiot, who continuously makes bad choices (with men, job, housing, etc.). I made some bad choices in my irresponsible mid-twenties, but no way could a girl as seemingly bright as ""Girl"" make some of the choices she does. I also skimmed to the end just to see how it all played out and was so disappointed I didn't even feel i needed to read the last 5 paragraphs of the book. Glad it wasn't a purchase, only a 7-day library borrow."
2,Huh? This is definately not their Style,"I started readin this book expecting a great novel by these two authors, similar to the Nanny Diaries. I, however, was obviously expecting too much. It had no visible plot. I am not one to put books down, in the middle of reading them , but with this one, I was tempted. It was a chore just to finish is. The main character, Girl, is a bit naive and a lot cliche. Spare yourself the 300+ pages, and read the Nanny Diaries instead."
2,definate let down,"i loved the nanny diaries and was really looking forward to reading another awesome book by these authors. boy, was i disappointed. i felt the main character, girl, took herself way too seriously and was considerably uptight. i also would have to agree with another reviewer in that the objective of girl's employer ""my company"" was never really specified. what the company actually did and what girl's role was was always lost on me. if you enjoyed the nanny diaries, great-i doubt you will enjoy citizen girl."
1,Disappointing read - get it from the library.,"I was so excited to read this book because I loved their first one, but I was so disappointed. Their style of writing is great and they created a likeable character, but I was annoyed with how she kept taking everyone's crap. I'm 29 and have had several jobs, but never would I or anyone I know let my boss be so ambiguous all the time. I understand that she was hungry for a job, but it just seemed so obvious that the opportunity at MyCompany was bogus. I'll still give the authors another try, but this time I'll wait for the book at the library."
1,Unfortunately bad 2nd attempt,"I picked up the Nanny Diaries audiobook when I started having a longer commute to work - it was great! I almost hoped there was traffic in the mornings! :) So naturally I sought out any other books by McLaughlin and Kraus and found this one. Unfortunately, it's terrible!!! The plot is all over the place, yet it's not interesting or intriguing in the least. The characters are either unlikable, underdeveloped or unrealistic. Things about the girls' writing style really start to get old, like repeating phrases or expletives 3 times (if you've read it, you know what I mean). And as far as the audiobook goes, the authors are the ones who read it, and they are terrible at it. Their voices annoy me to the point that I'd rather listen to a radio morning show with obnoxious DJs and sound effects."
1,HUGE waste of time,Books like this are why the feminist movement has been spinning its wheels in the mud for a long time. It amazes me that it took TWO women to come up with such drivel.
1,Expect to be disappointed.....,"Like the other reviewers, I too was anticipating this book coming straight off The Nanny Diaries. I have had the book for almost two months and still have 1/3 to go. Very disappointing and very difficult to read, not a page turner at all. Here and there you get bits of good writing, but the material is extremely boring. Another 'Girl' who is in a job that she hates and complains the whole way through. The other characters in the book are just as annoying and I fight every day trying to finish it. Rent it from the library. Don't spend a dime on it!"
2,Blah!,"I was very disappointed with this book! Was excited when I first got the book because nanny diaries was so good, but this one is not. Very hard to get into the book even in the first few pages. And someone tell me why they call the character ""girl."" Pass on this one."
1,Victim of a HORRIBLE READ!,"As I exited my flight from Seattle to Boston I left the book on the seat. A gentleman said, ""you left your book."" I looked at him with a blank stare and said, ""yes I did for the next victim."" This book was a sorry waste of paper, and words. Boring to the last page, as a college student I couldn't afford to not finish the book, having paid full price. Please save your money and DO NOT waste your time!"
1,"If you loved The Nanny Diaries, steer clear of this book","I really enjoyed The Nanny Diaries and was looking forward to the next book from this duo of writers, but I was EXTREMELY disappointed. The book and the characters in it are completely unrealistic; the main character takes a warped and perverse journey through a ridiculous corporate world. Nothing in this book makes sense, and it's painful to read. I highly doubt it even would have been published, if it hadn't been for the writers' earlier success. Avoid it at all costs."
1,Not good,"I love chick lit and read it constantly, so I was intrigued by this book based solely on it's description. Then I was even happier when I found out it was written by the chicks who wrote Nanny Diaries, which I loved. About halfway through the book, I just gave up. I couldn't believe how scattered it was - half the plot barely made sense, and I swear it was just one long stream of conciousness, blurting out random thoughts and sentences whether or not they were appropriate to the context. It's actually quite hard to describe what I didn't like about it (am I the only one who didn't understand why her 14 year old brother was sent into the city to take her to a nighttime job fair?). But I'm terribly glad that 1) I got it out of the library and didn't drop any money on it (I'd better return it on time!) and 2) I'm not the only one who feels this way, because for a while I was afraid I was just too stupid to understand it. Apparently such is not the case."
1,"So bad, I threw it in the recycling bag","I read all the time. I am in a book group and we read everything from popular fiction to the classics. Yet, one of my greatest pleasures is sitting down (or curling up) with some great ""chick lit"". Having liked ""The Nanny Diaries"", I eagerly grabbed this one at a book store when I was waiting for a train. I hated it from the very first word.The attempt at satire was lost on me. The story, though it tried to make a point, failed miserably. I could not get a handle on most of the characters and didn't like any of them (except maybe for Buster, the boyfriend). Most of the scenes were so confusing that I had no idea what was going on.Don't waste your time or your money. This one is so not worth either."
1,Disappointing follow-up from authors of The Nanny Diaries,"Although the first few pages of this book showed some promise, it soon disintegrated into a melange of silly plot lines, aborted dates and a strangely absent mother. This book is nowhere near as good as The Nanny Diaries which was imaginative, clever and had interesting character development to keep you engaged. If you actually make it to the end of this book, you will see how truly ridiculous the plot becomes. The only reason I finished this was because I kept hoping for a clever ending or twist...that never came.Maybe the authors drew on personal experiences which is what made their previous book so good, but this one truly misses the mark. I bought it for half price at Borders and still felt ripped off. If you haven't read The Nanny Diaries then I would recommend buying it, but don't bother with this one."
2,Disappointing read,"As many people have mentionned already, this book does not even come close to The Nanny Diaries. I felt the ""plot"" (was there really one?) was rushed, we were taken from one thing to another without knowing what was happening and the characters, even the main one, was unlikable. I finished it because I hoped the end would be satisfying, but it wasn't. In the end, the reader doesn't know what will happen to the characters at all. Not a clue. Very disappointing."
3,Kept my attention,"While far from a perfect novel, anyone who is young and entering the working world will be able to relate to the anguish that comes along with it: horrible bosses, encountering constant rejection, and learning the awkward art of balancing your work and your personal life. There's also a feminist theme throughout the book (the main character is a young feminist who aspires to work at a non-profit feminist organization) so anyone with an interest in women's issues might like it. Overall, it held my interest, but anyone who does not fit into the above criteria might find it boring."
1,From those wonderful folks who brought you Nanny Diaries....,"Oh, my. Where to start? Well, I can in all honestly say that this book is just about the most cardboard piece of fiction I've encountered in quite some time. The characters were so artificially set up to be representatives of all that is wrong with the workplace, that one could imagine Citizen Girl being produced for the screen -- as a cartoon!The heroine was unsympathetic, just as in Nanny Diaries, the authors' previous novel.Save your money, save your time. There's much better stuff out there to read."
1,The most disappointing second novel I've ever read,"I adored The Nanny Diaries, and so was thrilled to have some time this summer to read the second effort of the authors. Anyone looking for a similarly fun satire should run the other way if they see this book coming. There wasn't a single sympathetic or endearing character in my opinion, not even the ""heroine"", Girl. The quirky clichés of The Nanny Diaries are replaced with shallow, borderline offensive stereotypes. I'm a Long Island, New York girl- I have no problem with colorful language- but the over-the-top swearing and graphic, disturbing sex scenes serve no real purpose- they don't even make the book more interesting! I'm an English major, I inhale books every chance I get, but reading this was more painful than a root canal. Save yourself the trouble of seeking out this book, and just re-read The Nanny Diaries- your time will be much more well-spent."
1,Oh. My. God.,"I am speechless. The Nanny Diaries was so good - it was cute, and smart, and enjoyable to read. Not heavy reading, but better than most of the chick-lit out there. I can't belive that this book was written by the same people! Reading this book just made me extremely depressed. I read everything, and this is right up there on the list of the worst books ever written. It was bitter and cynical and the charachters had no real names - it was so confusing. I couldn't figure out the plot, and three-quarters of the way through I just gave up. I bought this in the airport and was so excited to see it - but that flight was just ruined by this awful, awful book. Save your money, folks. It's not worth your time."
1,Worst book I have ever read,"Save your money - this is the worst book I have ever read and had to read it, as it was our book club selection. The authors are a 1 hit wonder ~ there is no resemblance to the Nanny Diaries. This book sucked!"
2,"Unfortunately, I agree with the others ...","Like the rest of the world, I was a little let down by this one. I didn't think the characters were necessarily that poorly crafted; I just felt they were too angry, too bitter; I guess too much like real life! Also there were quite a few cliches in this one. We all expect some of that in this genre but there was just too much of it for me. Especially it was from authors who had such a fresh voice the first time out! That said, I'm holding my breath that they'll come up with something great again! I know I could use it!"
1,Whiny complaining citzen girl,This book sounds like every 20 something's complaint about how the world isn't handed to them on a plate.
1,Do not waste your time,"I bought this book based on the wonderful experience of ""The Nanny Diaries"". After a few pages I was ready to put it down. The story jumps all over the place and the ending is disorganized. Do not waste your time. It is incredible to believe that the authors are the same people that wrote the other book."
1,Huh?,"This book was extremely disappointing after reading the absolutely fabulous Nanny Diaries. I can't believe these authors could write such a distracted, bizarre story with no visible plot line. The main character is not relateable or enjoyable enough to care about. A waste of time and energy. Read Nanny Diaries but skip this one."
1,If you liked The Nanny Diaries....,"You will NOT like this!!I gave up trying to get into Citizen Girl on pg 85. V. glad that I did not spend my hard earned cash, but checked it out of the library!! The plot centers around ""Girl"" who is trying to get a job at MyCompanyInc with ""Guy"" - I never figuered out what this company did?!?From what I read, Citizen Girl is suppossed to be about a 20 something, NYC, single girl trying to find that perfect job. In a sea of popular ""chicklit"" novels, this one sinks to the bottom!!"
1,Easily the worst book I've ever read.,"What an uninteresting and ridiculous read. Although I had no vested interest in the book-ever-I continued to read hoping for ""the good part"". For the record, there isn't one.Why is the main character's name Girl? And without so much as an explaination (her parents were stoned hippies who loved the simpleness of it, or whatever)? And then her boss is Guy? Come on.Girl is not a likeable character. With no spine, she is quite simply just hard to like, hard to keep rooting for and hard to even care about.This is a *second* novel?? And some team read and re-read this book and thought this was the best version of it? Yikes.No thank you Emma and Nicola."
2,Boring...okay...and lost it,It started of as boring at most-too much detail not enough hype..Then It started to get better three chapters later but half way through the book sank. Maybe this co-authoring thing is to full of compromises and lacked organized direction. The last two chapter made no sense as if they just put it in to meet publication deadline.
1,The authors are trying too hard,"Each sentence is so overworked, you have to read slowly to absorb what the authors are saying. It's like being back in high school reading Shakespeare and you need the teacher to translate. The attempt at humor is lost when you feel the need to pull out a dictionary. The character is pathetic, and unlikeable. Don't waste your time, it's not ""The Nanny Diaries""."
1,a bore,"I barrowed this book from my sister, who said it was pretty good. More like pretty boring. The plot barely held my attention. Just when I thought it was getting better, the author goes off on unneccessary feminism rants. As a woman, I even found it a little over done. Just leave this on on the shelf."
2,Boring,"Bleh, Bleh, Bleh. After reading The Nanny Diaries, I was, admittedly, giddy to see that the two young authors had collaborated again and bought this book the minute I saw it. However, as I continued reading, I thought, ""Maybe TND was just beginner's luck."" This book is, quite frankly, slow. I could not get into it. Some parts of it were cute, and some parts of it made me laugh, but it took me about TWO MONTHS to finish and I read a couple of books in between. This book wasn't worth my time. I tried really hard to make it work for me, but it just didn't."
1,"Don't buy - if you must, get from the library","First of all - I get it. I do - I get what they were going for with the deliberate lack of definition - but it missed the mark horribly and made me stop reading about half way thru (after forcing myself *that* far).I understand feminism - consider myself a feminist - and I would NEVER consider ""Girl"" anything but Milquetoast. Her relationships are strange and passive and go nowhere, and never did I get the impression that ""Girl"" had a point of view. Which, is one thing a feminist would most definitely have.I could go on. I'll refrain. Don't waste your time... really."
2,Tending to agree...,This is a very disappointing follow-up. Citizen Girl seemed like the right book to buy... but it was rather flat and almost teenage-ish. I think I am returning this one to the bookstore... thankfully I kept the receipt.
1,Definitely not The Nanny Diaries,"I tried to read this book for my book club. I only made it to page 70. At my book club meeting I was told I had read the best part. If the first 70 pages was the best part, I would hate to know what the remainder of the book was about."
2,One plot wonders,"Halfway through Citizen Girl, I was struck by how similar it is to The Nanny Diaries. Young woman living in NYC really needs a job, and therefore becomes annoying doormat, putting up with incredibly abusive employers because she must. Citizen Girl is basically the same character as the nanny, just in a new situation.I actually didn't hate either book. Citizen Girl does have a bit of a funny twist at the end, but I probably won't waste my time or money on another book by these authors."
2,Huh.,"*WAY too much dialogue.*Didn't give a crap about the character--there was no background knowledge, nothing to make me feel empathy for her.*Because the story didn't appear to be based on something, it wasn't necessary to use another alias.*Couldn't wait for it to finish.Maybe nicola and Emma should have taken The Nany Diaries as it was--pure beginners luck!"
2,enjoyed it but got nothing out of it....,"I found this book enjoyable and funny at times, BUT it was quite unrealistic. The characters were so stereotypical it took a lot out of the book. I was hoping to see a little something out of the ordinary by the end but it never happened."
2,Didn't last the summer...,I bought these for the patio but they didn't last the whole summer. I've since replaced them with a string of screw in bulbs that are easy to replace when one burns out.
3,good but amatuer,"they have some good catchy tracks but the songs are just way too typical of emo/punk/pop rock. whatever you want to call it now days...this basiaclly sounds like some preppy pop rock you'd hear on the beach. and can easily be compared to at least a couple dozen other bands that have already been out. most noteably really similar to Cauterize, Matchbook Romance, etc.. they really lack definition and a sound for their own plus variety in their music would really help.no offense to them cause they dont sound bad for what they do, but if they had come out 2 or 3 years ago with theis cd then itd be different.. right now they are just putting out whats already been heard."
2,skip this one,"I found this uninteresting, and it dragged out so much. Too much detail, that I could care less about."
2,Second Hand Information Only,"Pretty comprehesive work, but most of the information comes from sources other than the band members themselves, such as magazine and music paper interviews. On the negative side, the author jumps around quite a bit with the sequence of events, as years and dates get quite jumbled. At no time during the reading of this book did I get the impression that the author actually appreciated the music of the Clash. An entire chapter was spent dismissing ""Give 'Em Enough Rope"", with ammunition from various English music paper's reviews. The author also spent a great deal of time pointing out that Joe Strummer's background was not that of a poor, illiterate yobbo. Recommended for the hardcore Clash fans who have already made up their own minds, but for the mildly curious, get a copy of the Westway to the World DVD."
3,Boring,"I got thi CD to hear David Daniels. He is nothing special on this CD (in contrast to later in his career where he is A#1) and I guess it's a nice CD, but did nothing for me."
1,Too Tight,"The shoes were shipped on time, but they didn't fit. It's hard to buy shoes that fit when you can't try them on first."
1,Useless.. just a BAD product!,"I've been using it for months, my scalp is getting worse and worse. It's even dryer and it seems to be some sort of rash. I hate it! btw, i haven't found a good product from Neutrogena, i've tried their face wash, sun block.. always bad experience. wonder why it's still a popular brand in US."
4,It works,"I used it, and it works better than anything else. The concentrated 2% tar is better than the typical 1% tar, but, I don't think it's necessarily worth the difference, unless you have a real bad case. The 1% T-Gel is comparable to a generic drugstore brand I've used; the main difference is that the Neutrogena shampoo base seems to be easier on the hair than the generic. Again, it depends on your hair, its length, and thickness.My main worry with coal tar shampoos is the health risk of coal tar. It's a VOC, and generally, putting VOCs on the skin isn't doing your liver any favors. Some people also say it's carcinogenic. Consequently, I've cut back on using this shampoo, using it for special occasions."
2,Selsun Blue works better,"I bought this product weeks ago at the advice of my dermatologist. I have sebborhic dermatitis (spelling?) and I get dry patches on my eyebrow and the side of my nose. During the winter, I also get it on my scalp. I knew that this shampoo did not smell pretty, but I figured if it got the job done I could handle it. Definitely not. My hair smelled awful all day long (it was as bad as a strong perfume, but if you were close enough you could smell it) and did not go away until I showered the next day. I continued to use it on my face though, as per the dermatologist's advice. It hasn't worked! I'm not sure why, because he swears by it and uses it for his dermatitis daily, but it just doesn't work for me. I was previously using selsun blue, and I will definitely go back to that. After one use, my dry skin is gone."
4,"Well, it works","It's kind of expensive, but a little goes a long way. I was surprised at how well such a small amount lathered, and it started to tingle and left my hair pretty soft. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it stinks, smells very medicinal. I guess that's how you know it's the good stuff."
1,Nasty shampoo!,"The smell is so bad and it honestly reminds me of moth balls, which I cannot stand. I was recently diagnosed with Guttate Psoriasis, and only have a few small patches on my scalp. Decided to try this stuff, bought it at a local grocery store because I had a $2 off coupon. It seems to help a little, but honestly, I just can't stand the smell. Along with the smell, the shampoo makes my hair feel nasty, not greasy or dry, just weird. When trying to style my hair after using this, I have really bad results. So if you have very short hair and don't need any body in your style, this may not be a problem for you. If you can stand the smell and the bad hair style, go for it. Would never buy this again and I try never to waste stuff, so I may try what one other reviewer suggested and mix this with another shampoo, to help hide the smell. I am doubtful that it will work, but may give it a try."
1,It Doesn't Work...None of them do,"Neutrogena's products are the biggest joke....they do not work for recalcitrant, stubborn dandruff cases. Coal tar has long been shown to be powerless against dandruff.If you have dandruff, you need to treat it with 2% sulfur treatments (you can buy the sulfur gel on here) and also VO5 hot oil treatments once a month. Then, use Selsun Blue. If that doesn't work, you can see a dermatologist and get cicloprox shampoo (very expensive - either be wealthy or have insurance cuz it's $120 per bottle) and antibiotics. I used Neutrogena's products for quite awhile in my teens (for hair and for skin), while seeing a quack dermatologist. I'm glad I wasn't paying for them, because they sure didn't work!"
2,smells bad,The t-gel stops my itching but dosent get rid of my dandruff. Also it smells like a mixture of horse poop and medicine.
1,"It's a SHOE cream, not a shampoo.","I bought this product about 30 days ago. The first thing that bothered me about the product was the SMELL. It smelled like a shoe cream. I wonder what kind of chemicals they use in this product. I assume it wasn't even tested.They market it as ""therapeutic"". But it doesn't help with the dry scalp at all. It makes the scalp very itchy and dry. Severe dandruff is the end result.I have to buy a different product to cure the effect of the 'therapeutic' Neutrogena shampoo."
1,not what I want,This product is not good. I felt no different after using it and it made my hair dry. I hate it!~
5,The best shampoo,THis shampoo is the only one which helps me.I have bought four bottles already and plan to buy again.
4,Definitely worth a try!,"Not a miracle product but it really helps. It has a strong odor but not to the point of being over-powering. I'd much rather have the smell than the flakes, crusty build-up and redness everywhere on my head."
4,Good..,"It a good product in terms of quality. It is worth the money that you pay. Healthy hairs... But , I was expecting little bigger bottle , it is less than what I thought ."
2,Doesn't work for me.,I was instructed to use this 3-4 times a week. It has Not cleared up my dandruff. In despiration I switched to Selson blue deep cleasning shampoo with deep cleasning beads. The selson blue works so much better. I am sticking with the selson blue. My dandruff is not an issue now. This coal tar shampoo didn't do anything for it. A waste of money for me.
5,It worked for both me and my son,"I tried this shampoo because my dandruff kept getting worse and worse and I had never had this problem in the past. I was deperate for something, and this worked great. It works best when I let it sit for a while, before rinsing out. It does make my hair dry, but I just follow with a good conditioner. It is worth the smell and I use it once a week now that the dandruff is under control. It worked on my son's hair too, when he used to get his hair cut, his scalp would be full of flakes, it was embarrassing."
5,Stunning book,"CopShock is a stunning book. Although it is focused on police officers, it helps anybody suffering from PTSD symptoms to cope--crime victims, victims of disasters, cancer, loss of a loved one, and all other emergency people like firefighters, emergency room nurses, doctors, and so on.The book is filled with excellent firsthand accounts, is based on hundreds of interviews of cops with PTSD, and is easy to read. The second chapter in particular clearly lays out the symptoms of PTSD as does the Appendix. The last chapter tells you what do do about trauma and PTSD, how to cope, manage the symptoms or to prevent PTSD. And the 6 years of research is amazing. This author did his homework. Many police officers complain that they have few or no resources to help them with their PTSD symptoms, making the hundreds of resources the author provides invaluable. This is the best book I've read on the subject."
5,Pottery Place,"My grandkids haave loved this book. The author uses a local women running a small pottery shop. She's shown demonstrating all aspects of making pottery to a local child. She demonstrates mixing the clay powder to her desired consistency. We learn the parts of a potters wheel & how to use it. They drink a cup of tea whild discussing pottery making. We also see a side view of a kiln & learn what it does. When the pottery cools, shse decorates each piece.Excellent book"
5,Good,I thought these speakers were great. They haVE AN Excellent dynamic range and are good for gaming and deep bass music.(nice bass) RECOMMENDED
1,Bait and Switch,"Not as represented, not as pictured. The photo shows a medium weight strap with a metal buckle. What I received was a paper thin strap with the cheesiest plastic buckle I have seen. Not worth my time to return. I am sure this is what they are counting on. Iwould not trust it to seal a garbage bag much less my luggage."
4,Good product,"I needed a new battery for my old laptop, which I gave to my sisters. The price was very good and they deliver it on time and the product was in excellent condition. As soon as I got it, I installed it on the old laptop and it is running perfectly there."
2,Fair at Best,This book was ok. I didn't really see the need after the previous books. Many of the information was vague and simply didn't really teach much the way Trump's previous books did. I recommned this book to read quickly. Then move onto his other books. They are more enjoyable with a more to gain.
1,Borrowed it to a friend.,My friend said he'd be doing me a favor if it burned it for me instead of returning it.Apparently it's full of egotistical crap like what cloths to wear and car to drive. He told me there wasn't the slightest insight into personal or business growth ideas.If you're into celebrity gossip or any of that BS then maybe this is the book for you. If you're looking to grow a business and get some new ideas worst book possible.Little discouraged as I think Trump is a really sharp guy and I'd love to learn a bit more about his insights. Apparently this book is nothing of that sort.
3,Good but could be better,"The Donald provides entertainment value alone in himself, have to expect that from him in his books, really a couple good pages with a lot of promotion in between, but those few good pages have value."
1,ONE STAR TOO MANY,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. RANDHOUSE SHAME ON YOU FOR PUBLISHING THIS JUNK. THANK GOD I ONLY PAID 50 CENTS FOR IT ...AND THAT WAS TOO MUCH !
1,Imperfect,"When I first picked up the book I believed that I would gain some insight as to what makes ""The Donald"" tick. What has motivated him over the years to keep going even though he overcame so much adversity ( i.e. when the real estate bubble decided to burst all over him). Instead I received a bunch of no-brainer advice such as which suits he likes to wear. He builds himself as a great perfectionist, but this book is far from perfect."
4,At it again.,"Donald Trump's book is divided in three parts. That's what the title refers to. The last part is about the Apprentice. Whether you like the book depends on whether you like Donald or not.Read <a href=""http://donald-trump.blogspot.com/"">this Donald Trump</a> website to see a true biography of Donald Trump.Donald is a reasonably good businessman, but he's a much better salesman. Ever since his emprire broke down in the New York real estate crash, he has traded more on his name than his fame as a businessman. The book is the same. Some good advice, a lot of Donald sales pitches.Don't forget to drink Donald Trump mineral water as you read this book."
2,Same ole same ole...,"Same stuff he has always said, different packaging! I would bet he doesnt even KNOW whats in this book!"
1,Content-Free Rubbish,"This is one of the worst uses of dead trees I've ever seen. It's complete dribble. Trump's first two books, The Art of the Deal and Survivng at the Top, were biographical pieces and were at least slightly interesting from that perspective. If a good editor were to tackle Think Like a Billionaire not a single word would remain afterward. It is complete and total crap. The majority of this book is devoted to a underwhelming discussion of the Mar-a-Lago diet, the Miss Universe and other pageants, and the first two seasons of The Apprentice. COUNTLESS times Trump congratulates himself on being the personal savior to NBC. At the beginning of the book he tells everyone not to take vacations and what lazy bums they are if they do. Later in the book he tells you how to pick a luxury hotel or resort. What? Oh, and when you leave the airport you should have your assistant call ahead to the hotel to let the manager know you're about to arrive. Yeah, I'll do that."
3,Good Reading for Apprentice Watchers,"This book is geared more to Aprrentice watchers than to the economist. Donald Trump is as much a TV personality as a business wiz, and that is why I enjoyed the book."
1,"Oh, what a junk...","He is boasting and boasting and boasting and, well, not much else. A lot of contradictory advice -- just in case something will fit your bill -- all made of trivialities like ""Count pennies"" and a moment later ""Don't be cheap"" and ""Billionairies wants everything best, do you know the best champaign?"" and ""Sam Walton was driving old Chevrolet"". And then a bit more boasting again, including instructions on where to buy expensive jewelry and what to eat for breakfast. This guy sucks."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"For someone that advocates no vacations and only sleeping four hours because work is fun, perhaps he should reconsider writing. This book was not fun and if someone brought this to him they would be fired. I do admire his loyalty to his friends. He spends too much time on his daily calendar and promoting The Apprentice and his resort. I like the show but not the book. Very little useful advice."
1,So painful...,This was terrible- just a long arrogant rant that borders on complete madness. I can't imagine why no one told him it was shockingly bad. You'd think the editor or one of his friends would save him from publishing something so incredibly embarrassing and valueless.I'm happy I borrowed this from the library and didn't actually pay for it. Skip this one! You might want to instead get one of these:- David Schwartz's The Magic of Thinking Big- Lynne Twist's The Soul of Money- David Bach's Automatic Millionaire- Adrian Slywotzky's The Art of Profitability
2,Copper-hued hair not included,"This McBook is worth a few chuckles while waiting for your $5.00 coffee in a Barnes and Noble, but it should stay in the bookstore.Donald's ghostwriter is pretty busy these days tranferring the wisdom of The Donald to the printed page so that masses of clueless people can get a peek into his world. With his sagely advice on tipping, as well as scoping out Elite Vacations magazine for his next yachting trip, Trump offers invaluable advice on succeeding in your pathetic, meaningless life.Of course, I assume he's writing a revised edition, since this one omits the chapter of 'thinking like a billionaire' that talks about writing a worthless, glorified supermarket checkout counter 'book', and collecting a few more dimes.Otherwise, the book has a shiny cover, and the paper stock appeared to be pretty standard. Shame there's no pictures."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this piece of garbage.,"All of Trumps pearls of wisdom could've been contained on a single sheet of paper. The rest is just dribble. Obviously, Trump & his publisher know that if they put a picture of Trump on the cover and give it a good title, the suckers will buy it. Several pages are spent on Trump's experience hosting Saturday Night Live. Totally useless. Several other pages are ""A week in the lfe of Donald Trump"" where mostly it's ""9:45am I got a call from my daughter."" or ""My friend Dirtbag Joe called just to see how I'm doing."" This book is 200+ pages of filler garbage to make money off his name from suckers.Trump's advisor, George Ross, wrote a much better book about the real estate business than Trump did. I do recommend the book by George Ross."
1,Not very interesting. I was expecting more from Mr. Trump,The book is way to shallow and doesnt offer any depth of advice for how to think like a billionaire. Its really a poor product that I would suggest not purchasing.
1,Why didn't I read the reviews first?,"This book should be titled Proverbs for Idiots, by the Chief Idiot!Don't waste your time and money. Full of nonsense and contradictions. He brags and bores.. Your favorite ice cream has what to do about being a billionaire?? His favorite picture is the one his daughter drew? Now that's some deep advice that's sending me on the way to financial freedom. My five year old son writes more entertaining stories. In fact most anyone could tell a better story.If you need advice to get ahead in life read books like Dale Carnegie's, How to Win Friends and Influence People, Rick Warren's Purpose Driven Life, or John Eldrige's, Wild at Heart."
1,Expected so much more from such a brilliant man.,"Very dissappointing! Each chapter is about a page and a half of material. I can sum up the majority of the book with the following: If you want to be successful in real estate find a good banker, want to get your finances in order hire a good accountant, etc. I think Trump needs to follow his own advice next time he wants to write a good book, he should hire a good author."
3,"Interesting book, but nothing special","Trump's book gives some easy to read advice about business and life in typical no-nonsense Trump fashion. He gives some interesting insights into his life, such as sleeping only 4 hours a day, reading over 3 hours a day, and some real estate advice.This book is certainly written in ""to-the-point"" fashion"". And in some cases, too much so. Some of his advice just plain stinks. Advice like, ""be sure to hire the right contractor/lawyer/banker"" but then fails to explain how one goes about determining this.However, he also goes through what a typical week in the life of Trump is like, which I found to be quite interesting. Just to see the amount of work he gets done in a short period of time was quite fascinating.So purchase this book if you are interested in the life of Mr. Trump, but don't expect any ideas that you probably haven't heard before. 3 out of 5 stars."
4,"Not a ""How to"" book, but overall a good book...","The Donald takes you on a trip into his mind. He lays out things that HE THINKS you'd want to know. (from a billionaire's prospective) He doesn't lay out any plans on how he became a billionaire or how he thinks one should go about being a billionaire. (which is what I think each reader is looking for based on the title) This book won't go down as the next ""must have"" for your self-improvement/motivation book for your library. It will, much to its credit, take you through his mind. It will make you believe...what the heck, I could be a Millionaire if he could be a Billionaire.I liked the book. My advice, don't buy it if your looking for the road map. Buy it, if you are looking for insight on what a billionaire thinks. (and I have to tell you, his thinking is not far off from most corporate executives or business owners. Billionaire or 100,000-aire)"
2,Not Worth Reading,"This was the first book I've read written by Mr. Trump but it was very disappointing. It's written more from a self promoting mindset. I realize it was after the success of the Apprentice but I didn't want to read about it in every chapter. Here's a recommendation, think like a billionaire and be more selective about your reading. Even if this book was offered free, don't waste your time on it. Sorry!"
2,Mr. Trump please stop writing these books,"You Know after reading this book, one thought came to my mind: I really hope that Mr. Trump Stops Writing these books to promote ""The Apprentice""Seriously... The only good things I can talk about this book is that it entertains you (for 2 hours) and it has GREAT pictures of Melania Knauss.It gives you some what encouragement to go out there and make money but really, you can learn alot more just by watching his show. (Plus his show is Free if you have a TV)want to think like a Billionaire? here is the first step, Save your money and Don't buy this book. (There are more books at Amazon.com that is MUCH MORE useful and cheaper)"
4,Practical? No. Fun to read? Yes!,"Think like a billionaire. Not that hard to do when you are one. More difficult for the average reader I guess. But hey, aim your arrow at the moon and you'll hit the mountain. I'll settle for a million or ten.Most of the reader reviews find this book a one-star crap thing. I strongly disagree, because you should know by know The Donald will not take you by the hand and let you make your first million.You want good advice? Better get his first book ""The Art of the Deal"" which teaches you some. But thinking like a billionaire is just like writing like a billionaire; he probably had two minutes to dictate per chapter.Despite all this, it was fun to read. What goes on in a billionaire's life and it just make you dream about being succesful as well, as long if you're not succesful already. Fun to read, crap advise. Four stars."
3,"Everything you need to know,but still I feel cheated","I was really looking forward to get this book. I'm a big fan of Mr Trump and I love his ideas on how to make business. When I started to read the book,I have to say,i was slightly dissapointed. He has good ideas but the writing is a bit poor and not clear as in how to actually follow the advices. I love however the way he points out people and how easily he seems to be aware of the enviroment around him. I give the book 3 stars as I think it has some good points,the topics are all you need to know, but as a business bible, it should have been more commands..."
1,It's easy to think like a billion-aire ... if you are one.,"I did pick up a couple of tib-bits and a few interesting facts from this book. You too will learn a lot about ""The Donald"" and how a billion-aire thinks, and when you're a billion-aire you can think like one. Don't expect to become a billion-aire by reading this book, but if you're really lucky you might become a hundred-aire."
2,"""Trump is full of himself again""","The first section of this book got me thinking...Maybe Trump is really going to give his readers some useful advise. Nope, I was wrong. I do start wondering just how the other half lives as I read his books. This book did make me think--thence 2 stars. Don't waste your time or money on this fine piece of self-indulgence. I think Trumps next major accomplishment is naming a God after himself."
1,What the hell...,"If you want to know everything there is about The Aprentice show, this is your book. Other than that, Mr Drump may have had a better time spent buying real estate. If you are looking to think like a millionaire, get the books on Rich Dad cause you will be waisting your time with this one. All there is about how Billionaires are, can be found in the Internet and some of it is mention in the book."
4,Didn't suck that bad,"Sheesh, after reading most of these reviews, I guess I disagree with you all. I actually liked this book."
3,Trump's talking,"Trump's book is OK. Some things are interesting, but many are boring. It is not as interesting as I thought it would be. I could find better use for my $15 (if you see it for $30, then it doesn't cost it for sure!)"
4,For the thinking Christian,"This book is a must-read for anyone who is looking for Christ-centered input while thinking deeply about the world around them. The book discusses everything from the ideas of Marx and Freud, to Huntington's ""Clash of Civilizations."" It elucidates clearly the effect of Modernism and Post-Modernism on the current state of Christianity, both positively and negatively. It also takes a good hard look at the alternative to the many philosophies and beliefs of this world that Christianity offers, and points out the idols that we often accept as substitutes for the truth of Christ. It is not an leisurely read, and familiarity with (even more so--interest in) basic philosophy, history, and current events is strongly recommended."
5,.,Great show. The acting is so good it makes it really easy to get lost in the show. Definitely worth the time.
2,"the ""okay"" book","By Thomas C. Hinkle This paper by, Jennie LaramieThe book I chose was Black Jack. There are many different twists and turns in this story. I picked this book because it is about dogs and I love dogs. Also, the setting is in the West and the West always sounded cool to me.One of the most exciting parts in this book is when Jack was fighting with Wild dog leader. It was that way because, the way they were describing that moment was so interesting!I only recommend this to people who enjoy lots of setting description. I personally didn't enjoy this book.The two main characters were Clark and Jack. Clark starts out as a young boy and after awhile he turns into a man physically and in his personality. Clark owns the do Black Jack. He also works on Jim Preston's ranch.Black Jack is the other main character and he is a wonderful dog. In the beginning of this story Bob Tail is the mother of Black Jack. In the book it said that Black Jack was the biggest dog in the West."
5,The bEST of all newer swingin' jump blues bands,"This cd is a classic, a jump blues cd for swing dancers and rockabilly nuts alike. Great hard rockin' feet stompin' finger poppin' picnicing and Sumemr BBQ-ing fun!!! AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Dance Your Yaz Off,When I get a Swing or Jump Blues album I am looking for dancing songs. This CD is loaded with a fine array of different tempo songs that will get you tapping your feet and jumping out on the floor with your partner. The male and the female vocals are great. Sound quality on my copy is good.
2,Déu/Disapointed,Je suis vraiment très déu par la mauvaise qualite de l'enregistrement. Le son est vraiment mauvais. I'm a french swing dancer and I have been very disapointed. The sound quality of this CD is very low & bad.
4,Garmin Fishfinder 400C,The unit works well so far and was very intuitive to operate. Only disappointment is that it does not indicate traveling speed.
4,Great reading,"This was a great book. However, the writing style made it difficult to read sometimes. There were some sentences with more than 80 or so words in them. This book does point out just how limited and how wrong psychologists and psychiatrists can be in providing 'expert' opinion. Dr Hagen is to be congratualted for writing this book."
1,"For an important topic, a disappointment","The topic is an important one, but unfortunately this book doesn't do it justice. It is relatively incoherent and sprinkled with anachronisms about modern clinical psychology. There are no well-thought through arguments explaining why psychology should not be used in its current form in the courtroom, because the information presented about such psychology is so simplistic and biased that it is a straw man's argument to refute. Find other literature on this important issue."
4,It's Barbie!,My daughter at 4 1/2 loves Barbies. She sings to the commercial so we know she wants it. She won't get it until Christmas but I am excited to get it for her. I went ahead and gave it four stars because it is a barbie and everything barbie is fun. Even if I won't let her put water in the washing machine she will have fun pretending. It will make a good addition to her other household furnishings. I don't know much about the durability yet but I think it is educational in a way because it promotes role play and she will learn the workings of a washing machine.
5,Quiet Thunder,"""Stronger Man"" is a CD worthy of a second look. I bought it as a gesture of kindness since I know the family. However, since then it has become my favorite music to relax with; it stands on it's own merits. The lyrics are refreshing-the acoustic guitar and back-up instruments are well-blended. It is a very ""finished"" piece of work, especially considering it is Kit's first CD."
4,I've used Neutrogena Shampoo for Permed/Color Treated Hair ...,"I've used Neutrogena Shampoo for Permed/Color Treated Hair this past week and have been quite pleased. It has a light scent and only takes a small amount to produce a rich lather. It rinses easily and left my hair with that """"squeaky clean"""" feeling. I have color-treated hair, so it often feels dry. I'd like to combine this shampoo with Neutrogena's conditioner. I think it would be an excellent combination."
4,I really liked the Neutrogena Shampoo for Permed ...,"I really liked the Neutrogena Shampoo for Permed /Color Treated Hair. It has a very nice fragrance to it, and when you come out of the shower, your hair stays smelling nice and is very manageable to dry. I like shampoos that have a lot of suds in them, and this one does!"
2,great idea poorly made,"I love this rake but the metal end is poorly connected to the handle & will inevitably separate. Somewhat fixable with duct tape or whatever, but you can't really yank the rake like you want to."
2,...a little disappointed,"I have seen this band live, and they put on a decent show, but I think the music itself is overrated. The sound is pretty derivative of 80s bands like Joy Division and Jesus and Mary Chain, even a little Sisters of Mercy. Those are all good bands, but I'm not crazy about yet another rehash of that sound. It's an OK album, but if it had been released 10 years ago it would have been classified as just another goth album. Now there is a lot of hype connected with this type of sound (like Interpol, for example), but in my opinion Revolver Modele is not very original, and there is more emphasis on image rather than substance."
3,So-So..,"After taking a close look at everyone's reviews for this product, I decided to purchase a size smaller than my regular size. I ordered a XS and it still came in a tad bit bigger. It comes with straps that you can install on your own, (which i did because I figured if i was going to be dancing at prom, i wouldn't want to keep fixing my dress in place because it was a little too big) But overall it was a nice dress, it's very cute for a short person, I have short legs and it didn't make it look bad at all!"
1,horrible!!!!,"the dress is absolutely horrible!!! I totally fell in love with it when I saw it on the pictures ... so I went ahead and bought it, 100% sure that I would dazzle everyone at the wedding I was going to ... but when I actually got it I was so shocked I can't even begin to tell you!!! The fabric is so cheap and horrible that in the best case scenario I can use it to dress up as a fairy for Halloween ... Total waste of money!!!"
4,Really pretty but a little weird,"I ordered this dress in ivory about a week ago for homecoming and it has already come in the mail. For the record, i live in Japan, so I'm not used to seeing such fast shipping! Its a very beautiful dress but from certain angles the puffy bubble parts look kind of weird. The back is a lot flatter than the front. Also, i ordered this dress in a medium (I'm about 5'4 and 115 pounds) and it fits pretty well but it slips down a bit but that might be because i don't have the chest to hold it up. It also comes with straps you can sew on and a really cute wrap thing that matches the dress and it makes me feel like a princess! Overall I really like this dress but there are some parts about it that look a little odd, such as the puffy front and the flat back."
1,"AWFUL AWFUL Dress,Do not buy! Very Cheesy","I hate this dress, I thought it would be way shorter and more bubbled up but it wasn't, it's unflattering dress and very long and the bubbles of the dress look unflattering.It has a disgusting polyester satin mix to it, polyester is the worst kinds of fabric it is cheap and does not look pretty.I regret buying this dress."
4,Homecoming dress,My daughter bought this dress for a dance at school. It was well made and fit her perfectly. A change that would have made the dress fit better would be to have the straps sewn in (and could be removed if not needed rather than sewn in if necessary) and some type of material to help the dress stay in place. She has other dresses that have a rubberized type strip around the top to help keep it in place.
2,"Pretty, but don't recommend","My daughter got this dress, wore it twice then the zipper broke. We had to take it to seamtress to get the zipper replaced."
3,It was pretty...,"The dress was pretty. Although, the sizeing chart was completely no where to being what it should be. I have a big bust, so i ordered a 3x just to make sure the dress would fit at the top, um yea i could have fit myself and 3 other people in this dress. Due to ordering the dress for a wedding out in Florida, i did not have time to send the dress back and get a new one. The shipping was very fast, but one thing i was not happy with is how it was shipped. It was shipped into a very very small box all scrunched up. Over all i ended up sending it back and getting a different dress somewhere else!"
3,"Very pretty, but smaller than sized","All of the pacific plex dresses are gorgeous, but seriously they are European sizes. I'm in between small sizes and I'd to reorder some dresses in different styles and sizes due to their appearance. If you order those dresses go ahead and pick one or even two sizes bigger, you'll see why!"
4,Wonderful Service,Everything was nice...the dress came really fast and it looked wonderful on me!! I would definitely order a dress from them again.
2,"Not as bad as Catch 22, but not as good as Hypocrisy","This was of course a serious relief after the disastrous Catch22. But Hypocrisy doesn't show a lot of personnality here. (Even though I always considered Hypocrisy hollow in fast songs, only in slow or mid paced song did they manage to make the emotions flow) Actually, if blindtested I would probably have said that it was nu - In Flames because it is really what it looks like.All of this is really formatted, but it s not unpleasant to hear..."
2,"Hypocrisy sucumbs to fan outrage, churns out more the same","You've heard this album before. Catch 22 was new and innovative. If you're tired of the same old, same old and want to hear music that tests the boundaries -- check out Hypocrisy's Catch 22. If you want to hear Hypocrisy retread an album from 7 years ago because the fans couldn't handle anything outside of the strict spectrum of death metal -- then buy this (or their 1998 release, what's the difference?).I almost hope Hypocrisy sticks to churning out uninspired crap just so their fanbase's brains turn to jell-o. That'll show 'em!"
5,Deserves more than 5 stars,"I can't get enough of this cd! Every song is amazing, different from previous albums yet retains that trademark Hypocrisy sound. The songs are slower and more contemplative yet pack a heavy punch, sure to get your head banging. The slower songs actually sound more hateful and extreme than the faster songs of the past. Makes up for the brutality in my view.Peter's voice is great on this cd, incredibly hateful and extreme. I have always enjoyed his abrasive vocals, but this is his best yet. My favorite song (though every last one of them is remarkable) is the title track. It has a bleak atmosphere that causes the hairs to rise, the multi-tracked voice of Peter on the chorus is perfect! Beyond words...Buy this masterpiece of groove-laden, hard-hitting, grimly atmospheric metal. You shan't be dissapointed."
4,very good basics book with lots of color pictures,"This book could be sub-titled ""A great way to your partners happiness - help save your marriage"" The pages are unusually thick paper for a inexpensive book today. There are many many color pictures all through the book. Just enough aromatherapy to get you started and more than enough massage concepts to keep you busy. My wife said after her first session ""Did you learn all that from reading the book ? """
1,Made hair fall out....,"This product combined with Infusium 23 Leave-in-treatment made my hair fall out. It also made my hair shiny, but than I had an allergic reaction within about two days after using it. Redness and inflammation occurred around my ears and head, then my hair started falling out where the redness occurred. If you start noticing redness after using this product, be careful! Your hair could start to fall off!"
4,I'd definitely recommend Infusium 23 Maximum Body Shampoo ...,"I'd definitely recommend Infusium 23 Maximum Body Shampoo For Fine, Thin Hair to my family and friends who have fine, thin hair. The shampoo has a pleasant scent, lathers well, and gave body to my fine hair. The shampoo worked especially great when used with my regular styling products!"
4,The Infusium 23 shampoo was adequate. I enjoyed ...,"The Infusium 23 shampoo was adequate. I enjoyed the light fragrance, it wasn't overpowering like some other shampoos. I also liked the fact that it took only a small amount to work up a good lather. I couldn't tell if the shampoo held up to its claims of adding more body or not, I don't have limp, fine hair, so it was hard to tell. I do have shoulder length hair, which I use styling products on. I noticed Infusium 23 did a good job of removing the styling product residue. Overall, I'd rate the product adequate, but not outstanding."
4,Nice!,I only wanted a basic piano (no special features) but good quality and as close to a real piano as possible. I read the reviews and bought this over the 500 or other models and am pleased. The 'casio' pedals aren't very big but they do the job. The casio stand and pedals would work best on tile or some hard flooring (I only have carpet in my appartment). I only mark this 4 stars because I don't have any other keyboards to compare to.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I bought this item & the transpose function didn't work - might be a problem w/ the product - I know someone else who has the same problem. So, I sent it in for repair per their instructions. But, Casio repair service is the worst I've ever seen. They're even worse than Best Buy & that's pretty bad. They rec'd my item for warranty work on 11/23/04. At first I was told the turnaround for the repair was 5-10 business days. Then I was told that starts from the log date. THEN, I was told that it's 10-15 business days from the log date!!! They didn't even get around to logging it in until 12/7/04!!! They had the product 9 business days prior to even logging it in!!! I may never see my product again. So beware, if you purchase something from them, I hope you never have to have it repaired!"
4,A good rendition,"Let's face it --- Bizet is very nearly impossible to screw up, no matter who incompetent one might be. Certainly nobody will accuse Charles Dutoit of incompetence when it comes to French music of this era. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that these suites are right in Dutoit's wheelhouse.At the same time, there is nothing in particular that makes this recording stand out from any other which I have heard. Also, the liner notes are virtually non-existent.In short, you won't regret buying this one...but it isn't as though you should feel the need to move heaven & earth to get it."
2,Low Photo Quality,"This book really covers a variety of arts & crafts style houses--in fact a few of them are houses in a different style which include arts and crafts touches. As the title indicates, they are new houses (including one major remodel).There are lots of great elevation drawings and floor plans. However, a few of those floor plan drawings are almost too blurry to read, and SEVERAL of the photos are blurry.It is this low photo quality that causes me to recommend against buying the book. They are literally bad enough to be distracting.I would, however, recommend that anyone interested in arts & crafts homes or ""nods"" to the arts & crafts movement in different-style homes get it at the library, like I did."
1,Amateur garage band,"I was so incredibly disappointed by this purchase. I bought it for my mother and knew she would love it. Rather then hearing songs reminiscent of the Abruzzo region I heard as a child, I heard what could be best described as screeching. The vocal and musical quality was non existent. Terribly disappointing."
5,exactly as pictured,I got three of these to go on the wall in my stairway. They are exactly as pictured and I am very happy with the quality of the product.
1,GARBAGE ALBUM BY JUVENILE!!,"All I got to say is this album is absurd and is straight trash. I can't believe Juvenile would make this horrid of an album. From the lyrics, to the beats, everything is just plain wack. Mannie's production is gettin really played out! I advise not to get this album even if your a Cash Money or a Juvenile fan...It's a waste of your money...trust me!"
2,PROJECT JUNK,"I bought the new CD by Juvenile which is called Project English word is that this piece of disappointment because tha beats and sounds have gotten a lot of weaknesses in the music, I should have saved my money for Mariah Carey's brand new Glitter CD or any other CD that would sell many copies and go platinum, double-platinum, multi-platinum or quadrudple-platinum ""Set It Off"" Hb HeadBusta, Sunshine (cause it got that reggae kinda beat), Be Gone, n The Nolia, and What U Scared 4 until that 80's type of rap beat came in. For some reason I really don't think Ju-Ju's not gonna make it in the rap game for 2001 cause 400 degreez and tha G Code were a lot better and a lot more tighter than this one so hate if u wana but i'm not taken any fricken advance of nobody, but don't get me wrong I still like rap/hiphop but not tha weak stuff to me. Turk BG BigTymers Lil Wheezey JUVE still continue to keep it real but JU yo cd is so wzzzack."
1,He needs to learn ENGLISH!!!!!!!!,"what's wrong with the world today when juvenile and master p can sell millions of cds that make no sense whatsoever? I've heard badd rapping but never like this. I don't listen to rappers that have too much gold/platinum teeth because they sound so uneducated with lyrics a 2 year old could write. If you want intellegent rap to listen to buy Jay-Z,Eminem,Ja Rule,Outkast Busta Rhymes ect"
2,"Juvey, I can't wait to see you on your own label!","In a world where artists leave their families to explore new options, it's evident that Juvey has focused his attention elsewhere. He has UPT records coming out, and he's saving his recclaim to glory for that. Comparing this album to 400 Degreez is like comparing Ready to Die to Life After Death, it's not fair because most of this isn't Juvey's work.Being a huge Juvenile fan, it would take a real sh**y album to make me believe that it only deserved two stars. Baby and Suga Slim dilivered one via Cash Money style. (I'd never give Juvie one star because he's got some catchy phrases)It hurts to say this, nothing against Juvenile, because he has a lot more to come, but don't look to get anything out of this album. Save your money for a year when the Real Juvenile RETURNS!"
2,Juve's Worst CD,"I am a huge fan of Juvenile, not to mention the Hot Boys. But this cd was just a disgrace. There are only 2 songs that are good on this cd and I can't even name them off the top of my head right now. The guy who said this cd is better than 400 degreez must not understand real dirty south rap. 400 degreez is not just the best cd juvenile made, it's one of the best rap albums ever made. So, if you're like me and keep every cash money cd in your collection, buy this cd...but don't expect to hear a chart topping cd."
2,The project failed,"Juvenile WHAT HAPPENED ??!!!! I really enjoyed Juvenile's ""400 degrees"" but Project English.......... I just don't know what to say. Its.....garbage.{I hate to say it} Juvenile was the ONLY cash money artist I ever liked. But this album only had a couple of songs I liked, but being truthful here, I don't recomend this album at all."
3,not his best work,this cd was definitely not his best work. the sing he released on the radio is the best he has to offfer do not buy this cd and think it will compare to 400 degress yoou will be sadly mistaken.
2,"PROJECT HISTORY,August 22,2001","I bought Juvenile's new CD Project english it was such a real big fat disappointment, I even told myself that I was not going to listen to no more after being bought from the record store. It shocked me when I was lisening to tracks like Set it Off HeadBusta Be gone In The Molia were the only tracks were worth listening to, so save your money folks cause it ain't worth buying if you want it so so bad. I think the problems about this CD were tha lack of beats and sounds were not like Tha G Code and 400 Degreez plus it sucks needs to be recycled at Cassh Money recycling center, so I am making a copy of the only ones that were sharp then sell it to sombeody who might like it, I don't care about tha haters but what I'm sayin' is really really true. To all my dawgs who are CashMoney millionare fans do not I repeat don't think about orderin' buyin' purcahsin' this CD for 14.99 because it's a waste of time!!Da-hey!!"
3,CMR runnin LOW,"Maybe you guys know this already. The beat for ""Set It Off"" is kinda old (like about 6-7 years I think). It was first used in a song called ""Drag 'Em in the River"" by a long-gone Cash Money group called U.N.L.V. This shows that Manny Fresh is runnin low on ideas."
3,Not as helpful as expected,"I purchased this book to help me get my own MomTime group started and I anticipated finding information on how to do that. There is a basic framework provided, but it's not as specific as I would have liked, especially on ideas for childcare for very young children. Much of the book (23 pages) is filled with recipe ideas for the group - these are complete menus for up to 12 weeks. Several of the other pages are full of topics & questions for discussion - I would find these helpful if starting up a group on my own.Overall, I didn't find it complete enough to help me start my own group, but others may find the basic framework to be just what they need."
4,This was a perfect product for me to ...,"This was a perfect product for me to test, because I have psoriasis. The product reduced flaking, relieved my itching, and left my hair shiny. They could improve the smell, but most tar products I've used have this problem. Also, the large bottle was too bulky and clumsy for the shower. It would definitely hurt if it fell on your foot. (I put some in a smaller bottle.) Overall, I liked the product. I felt it worked well and was a good deal. Most shampoos of this sort are more expensive. I'd buy it."
1,What a disappointment!!,"When we ordered this disc, we expected the movie ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" redone with puppets. It sounded hilarious but what a waste of money it ended up being. The puppets do look funny but the feature runs only 15 minutes and the disc is 15 dollars!! There are ""out takes"" included but they are so painfully bad that we took the disc out after only a few of them... and we actually enjoy Plan 9. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this disc. Plan 9 the movie is included as an extra, but you can but that on Ed Wood collections for about 10 bucks."
3,This item is an average ice scraper.,It good for the money. You get what you pay for. Just don't try to bend it in a hard snow bank.
2,atmosphere is not enough,"My first mistake was in deciding to tackle this book even after discovering it was a sequel, yet I did so after having been assured that reading the book's predecessor was not a prerequisite to enjoying the follow-up. The first 100 pages were wonderfully creepy and atmospheric, and I seemed to be piecing together the plot and filling in some of the blanks that came with not having ready ""Silk"". But the book shifts from horror to a rather lame SF/fantasy and the plot becomes increasingly intricate and confusing, and the characters' allegiances and motivations are all difficult to fathom. My second mistake was reading it to the end after suspecting that my time was being wasted, yet I persevered only to find the ending was hurried and slipshod. By the final page, I really didn't care about the characters and the fact that they all were dead (in this world anyway). The author is undeniably talented but this book just didn't do it for me..."
3,WHAT???????????????????????????,"Okay I got lost in the start of this book there was allot of whinning... I had to tell myself to read this book I paid for gotta read...Half way thru I was loving the twist and turns,thank god the whinning had stopped...Then here we go again, what just happened I was loving it...The end was weak weak weak.............So if you like weak start, great middle and back to weak end then this is the book for you...."
5,"No Aliens, No Whining","I never wear black (it makes me look ""washed out""), have a strong dislike of aliens, and don't even know what ""drad"" means, but I thoroughly enjoyed Murder of Angels. Like anyone working unconventionally in a conventional form (in this case, dark fantasy fiction), Ms. Kiernan is bound to perturb and even anger some people. Let them whinge, I say. This is a lovely novel that held me absorbed from start to finish. The literary techniques she employs certainly have classical precedents. Even if they didn't, where would be the problem? Isn't this sort of fiction about stretching or breaking boundaries - not seeing how closely you can stick to them?"
2,Well written but depressing,"Perhaps I needed to have read Silk, first. But I found that this book, while containing some excellent wordsmithing, made me unutterably depressed. Enough so that I gave up on the book before I finished it.The author has an excellent control of setting, character, storytelling... and she communicated the depression and despair of the main characters with skill. But I don't necessarily *want* to be depressed.I grabbed this book before a plane flight. By the time the peanuts and juice arrived, I had given up on the book, and I dragged out my laptop computer. (""Ah well, I probably should get some work done anyway"" is not my response to a great book -- ""just a few more pages..."" is more common.) And then I bought another book in San Francisco to tide me over on the way home.I'll make a point of looking for Kiernan's other novels. But this one didn't work for me."
2,"The word ""ripoff"" comes to mind immediatetly....","....Somebody jumps off a bridge into another world! WOW! This was done much better in the movie ""Kate and Leopold"" and Kate and Leopold were much more likeable than these characters, a drugged-out-stereotypical rock singer and her psycho lover. Sci-fi fans may be mildly entertained, but ""portals into other realms"" have been done much better in scores of other books. If you like entertainment, this is too dark - and dull."
5,A New Classic,"I'm an avid reader of the weird and fantastic. I come to a darkly fantastic story with a certain set of expectations. The author must, above all else, make me forget the world in which I am reading and transport me to the world of his or her fiction. They must make it real. They must make it tangible. They must make me see through their eyes.To say that Caitlin R. Kiernan is a master of this act would be an understatement.Murder of Angels is a feast for the imagination. Few authors of horror or fantasy can match her ability. Brava!"
4,Dark Fantastic,"A very dark bit of fantasy. This book is sort of a sequel to Silk but it's not necessary to have read Silk to enjoy this one. Mental Illness, lovecraftian monsters,substance abuse, love, betrayal, sacrifice and alternative lifestyles all play a part. This is not Keirnan's best but it is one of her darkest. I would start with Low Red Moon instead of this one but they are all very good. Be warned this is writing for adults with no clean endings or one dimensional characters."
5,"a new visionary, a great book","If I could give this novel more stars, I would give it ten.Eloquent commentaries on MoA have already been included in other reader reviews. I must say that realistic characters who find themselves in magical or mysterious circumstances make all of Caitlin Kiernan's works astounding. She is an author capable of creating such worlds, so that I can believe in these worlds, like no other. To me MoA is a story of love and hope. If you've never read her writing before, read this!"
2,THIS BOOK READS LIKE THE AUTHOR WAS ON LSD,"Please note that I have enjoyed every one of his previous works, and actually bought a couple of copies of DOMAIN to give out to friends, but RESURRECTION is nearly unreadable.Instead of the linear plot development of his previous novels, here Alten plays with the concepts of time travel, wormholes thru space, and other concepts derived from quantum physics.He might have amused himself and his best friends this way but the net result for me is that I was constantly annoyed - particularly the way the basic plot synopsis seemed to be repeated several times. Steve - piling on the B.S. so thick causes the reader to be unable to suspend his disbelief, something a work of entertainment should never do!"
3,Good enough to set up third,"This one isn't as good as Domain. But its good enough to make me want to read the third.Much less action, a lot fewer ""oh thats cool!"" moments. The furthest future setting, from the Twins maturity on isn't the best ""future"" I've read. Some of the ""swearing"" (in the future we combine curse words into longer, single, stupid words) is a real lowlight. So bad its hard to take the passion of the speaking character seriously. The mythology begins to involve a lot more Christian symbols, which is unfortunate because Domain's reliance on the Popol Vuh was fun. I've read a hundred stories about God and Satan, but only two about Hunaphu and Xbalanque - the Popol Vuh and Domain. Nonetheless, this book is good enough to recommend, but not as strongly as Domain."
4,Great book unusual story,I would have rated this book a 5 had it gone into more details on the Mayan and Christian myths and as Domain had. Domain was most definitely a 6 on a scale of 1-5. The story was unique and the ending without giving away too much may have been the way Adam and Eve started and the does not deny the existence of God. I hope the 3rd book will be as good. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MR. ALTEN!!!
1,"Resurrection ""Why I Should Not Waste Hard Earned Money?""","To date, I have read every book that Mr. Alten has written. They have been ""GREAT"" each and every one of them, until now. I purchased Resurrection and I'm about half way through the book and I am ""BORED STIFF!"" Mr. Altens other works were fased paced and loaded with Action/Adventure that took you into the book and had your blood pumping. Resurrection, on the other hand, can put one to sleep real quick. It would be nice if books like this came with a ""Money Back Guarantee."" I purchased Primal Waters last week and I'm waiting for the Postman to deliver it as I speak, I just hope it's nothing like ""Resurrection!"" Mr. Alten if you ever read this I hope you go back to your old style of writing!"
3,Resurrection,"A very good book if you like Steve Altens writing. A little too explanatory in a lot of places, but all in all, very thought provoking and a very good read. The only problem now is I have to wait for the third book to come out. Hurry up Steve!"
1,Absolutely terrible,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. There really wasn't a cohesive plot, the characters were all cartoonish and the mythology was completely jumbled together. If I could have given this negative stars I would have."
5,true page turner,"I have read this book, and many others from this author, but have to say, this is a true masterpiece of written science-fiction. A great follow-up to his Domain novel. The entire story will have you hooked from cover to cover, and you won't want to put this book down until you are done, and even then, you will want to get the final chapter to see how this story ends. Anybody who is new to science fiction or even a seasioned sci-fi veteran will enjoy this story. I highly recommend this book to anybody."
1,Waste of time,"When I read the first one I thought this will be good... But for my surprise... It was really bad!! After I read this one I decided NOT to read the third one, if this was bad, I cannot imagine how bad can be the last one"
2,Too Old For System,"I was disappointed. When I read the specs given in the ad, it stated that it can be played on Windows XP. Yeah it plays, but very slowly. When I read the package, Windows XP was not one of systems printed on the box. This will be last time I purchase any sofware that I can not read the specs for myself"
4,Great product,"I have yet to use this!!! But if it is like the previous version that I had, I'm sure that I will love it also!"
5,Better than that other big book.,Better than zittelli's as an atlas i think. more useful clinically as well.
5,My son is very happy!,"The perfect practical manual for making bassoon reeds! My son is a senior in college and has been on a mission to perfect his reed-making technique. His professor recommended this book, and has become a great reference for him. Seller did a great job shipping quickly."
4,Great but not as good as the first.,"Sue Limb has done it again, created a funny and quirky story about a British teen's insecurities and life adventures. This book is a nice fun read but not nearly as funny or surprising as the first. I look forward to the third installment all the same though. If your daughter liked Bridget Jones she would love this series."
4,Positives and Negatives,"My thoughts:Positives:* This type of book is always very funny to me.* Typical teenage girl in love behavior filled with jealousy and ""going to kill you"" fantasies.* Emotions run rampant and I understand that better than staying calm all of the time* When her father tells her that he's gay, it's the coolest thing that she can imagine. That part of the book is very inclusive and hilarious at the same time. It's a great way to bring up a sensitive topic.Negatives:* This type of book has a plot, but really the side stories distract you from it consistently. There is no ""point"" to this story.* She can be a little too dramatic at times.* Honestly, you never really find out what's going on between the family members. Perhaps I would have had to read the other ones to understand the problems between her mother and her."
3,"Was unable to see past ridiculous, needy, disgusting insecurity of the main character","Absolutely obnoxious. So insecure as to be pathetically whiny and ridiculous. I can understand how she would think her boyfriend would get sick of her, what with her CONSTANT NEED for reassurance and total absence of any comments including, about, or near to one or multiple girls. What a pathetic speciman of a human being, how utterly sad and unlikably. Shut up, stop whining, and get over yourself.Was occaisonally amusing, the story was good, I enjoyed the first one, but the whining was so ubiquitous that it really interfered with my ability to enjoy it. I am not the most self-confident person ever, but if I was ever that needy and dependent and insecure, well, I would not want to go on, so I did not find it amusing or identify with it or anything. Idiotic. Was a pretty fun story other than that, and it was funny in many other parts, but, god, that drive me to the edge....As you can see."
4,Choice bits and pieces from 1933-39,"Beecham was porbably at his peak before the war when he led the London Phil. and was extensively recorded. Thanks to the limits of 78 sides, the bulk of his output consisted of pieces that were less than 5 min. long. That's true here, the only longer work--Borodin's Polovetsian Dances--lasting 10 min. The state of recorded sound was variable in the Thirties, even more so when you consider that a company like Dutton must relie on surviving commerical disks. So one should expect everything from dim, boxy sound to surprisingly full and rich sound. All the surfaces are impeccably quiet, however, which makes it elatively easy to adjust one's ears. Beecham cnducts everything with great panache, but I'm not sure I am fond enough of light-classics snippets (15 in all) to care."
1,Very disappointed,"I know that this hoe cost about half of what I could have bought one at a garden center for, but I was very disappointed. After about three to four times of striking the ground in my freshly tilled garden, the blade on this hoe bent as if someone had put it in a vise. The blade is so thin and the metal so soft, I can take my hands and bend it. Not a very well designed product in my book. I am very disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Don't waste your money,"I used this one time, and the blade on the hoe bent. It's the usual cheap chinese garbage. A hoe blade should be tempered, but this one is obviously mild steel. Don't waste your money."
2,Not What I Exspected,"This is not what I expected. They were a little light for the work I wanted to do, so I was not as happy as I thought I would be."
5,Finally the most of the itch and the flakes are gone,"OK, I am re-writing my previously positive review. This product was great... for the first 2 weeks, then my hair went back to itching and flaking.I went to the dermatologist who suggested the tea tree shampoo which is very expensive on Amazon, so I bought it at a retail location called ulta. So far, a week has gone by and no itch... If I don't re-review this by October, 2012, it means that the tea tree shampoo worked wonders.All the best with your flaking, peeps."
1,Very dry scalp..,"I would not recommend at all! After regular use of product, my scalp did not clear up at all. Instead, my scalp became very very dry!"
4,"I like this product, but it is too expensive","I like this product, but the cost is too much. The scent is not over powering and the liquid has a nice consistency. The active ingredient is 3% Salicylic Acid. Other brands have the same active ingredient for much less. When I finished this shampoo, I started using Garnier Fructis Anti-Dandruff Clear Control Shampoo, 13-Fluid Ounce, with 3% Salicylic Acid, and only spend $5.29 here on Amazon. Neutrogena makes great products, but there are other options."
3,This product performed as expected. It isn't a ...,"This product performed as expected. It isn't a product that I'd recommend using unless you have some serious scalp disorders. Viewed as a medication, I would have to say that you could probably not find a stronger or more effective solution over the counter."
3,Ok,Not as great as expected. Its not as bubbly as the T-gel and the scent is very dry. i guess its just not for me.
1,did not work for me,"My dermatologist recommended this so I bought it, but I've been using it every other day for the last 3 weeks and it's not working :( still have a ton of flakes. Agree with all the other reviews that it smells nice and seems good for my hair, but it really does nothing for my scalp."
5,Barber said my hair was nice,The hair cuttery girl said my hair was really smooth and nice for a guy. Controls my dandruff well too. Definitely agree.Only downside is the size of the bottle is pretty small.
4,Good USB power adapter,"The box advertises that this adapter is for an iPod, but it works fine with my Sansa. I would assume that it will work well with any other MP3 player as well. The adapter is a little wide, so if you had 2 plugs side-by-side there could be a problem. My USB cord slid off too easily, but ths could be a problem with any USB adapter, and not the unit. It is nice that the plug folds in for portability. There isn't a light to indicate that it is active. All-in-all it is a decent adapter for the price (1 penny??)... the shipping is the ""real"" price."
5,Hours of fun,After a couple of years these items still are holding up. Initial assembly was a bit tedious but since then it they have been hours of fun for a very rough and tumble 3 year old. Great value.
4,Solid purchase fun for my nephew,My nephew is a 'hands on' kind of kid. I got him these building blocks to play with and build forts. The quality and durability I would range in the C (on an A-F scale) but that is what I expected for the price. I'm happy with my purchase.
4,Nice Product,"This is a nice product, and I do recommend it. But just be careful who or what you buy it from!"
5,"Moving, Reflective, Worth every penny","Mister Rogers was a regular part of my life as a child. I remember sitting in front of the TV everyday. Singing his ""It's such a good feeling..."" song along with him. His gentle nature and optimistic look on life rubbed off on me.Today, as I travel the country presenting workshops and seminars on the power of being positively passionate and defeating the ill effects of negativity, I think Mr. Rogers' words echo within.This book captures the essence of Mr. Rogers' work. Read it and reflect on his simple truths and powerful philosophies. I've already purchased several copies of this book as gifts to others.Mr. Rogers lives in every person who searches for the good in things and strives to make the world a better place!"
5,A wonderful book for kids and adults,"Like many adults, i grew up on Mr. Rogers and remember his TV shows and characters. This book is aptly subtitled- ""important things to remember"" and is a great collection of stories, anecdotes and thoughts on topics that matter like Love, relationships, individuals, respect and honesty. It help us remember what its like to be a good neighbor.There is a foreword written by his wife which is very touching and the book is easy to read--each short anedote/saying is printed on a separate page. It would be a good idea to read a page a day and use that as the basis for ""a thought for the day.""This book would make an ideal present for the coming holidays, especially for kids and for those who grew up with Mr. Rogers and didn't we all??"
5,Direct Yet Gentle,"The Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the StartI love Mister Rogers' writing style; his straightforwardness which was also gentle. This book is written in the simple language that he's known for -- even younger children will understand. Read it to yourself and dare, as he did, to be yourself. Read it to your children to encourage them in the ""important things to remember"" in life."
5,Excellent simple printer,"I got this printer because its cheap, the ink was affordable, and I trust HP. I've been using HP printers for 6 or 7 years now and have had no problems. I needed an affordable compact printer for a dorm room, and this fit the bill. The print quality is very nice, I find it to have a good print speed. I haven't had any problems with it like I have seen other reviewers complaining about, and I don't foresee any. I'd recommend this for someone that just wants something that prints with nothing fancy."
2,HP printer surprise - no ink,"The package has the black ink cartridge not included. Sort of a trick which I don't care for. Otherwise, the printer in OK."
2,5 Stars for printer.cartidge issue 2 stars!!,Installation was a breeze no problem prints fast with nice clear letters. but after printing about 90 pages of documents the printer notified me that i was running out of ink and i had the printer for only 3 days not good! how much money do you have to shell out each month if you print a lot.the previous printer i had the ink lasted me for many months even after a lot of use!!!
1,A terrible printer,I have been using HP printers so long I can't remember my first purchase. This printer is nothing more than a piece of junk. HP should be ashamed to be selling this flimsy trash.
1,Terrible Printer,"The pages came out crooked and the pictures came out different sizes than chosen. Pictures and text page imageswere off center- cutting off parts of the intended information and leaving blank areas on the other side of the page. I choose not to have the extras programs, because they are trouble, but the printer install disk put them in against my wishes. Took me 2 hours of hunting those files and deleting them. Most of those files were for ""upgrades"", so the installation of those files were spam to try to get me buy more- virus is a better word. In the trash is where I but this printer and I hope nobody else has to go through what I did. Do not buy."
2,HP sucks,"Bought HP Deskjet D2400 for minor everyday printing. Problems I have encoutered so far:1. The Smart Web Printing software interferes with Word and Internet explorer: when I'm trying to open a file or an intenet page the software starts installing and re-installing itself; - a bummer2. the paper port is so poorly designed, that for one,you simply can't fit a usual 8x11 sheet of paper in; for two, you have to really push it deep in, b/c otherwise the printer does not 'see' it; for three, when you do push your paper in deep enough the printer chokes on itthe only thing that was good about this printer - was the priceThe final though: when I am ready to invest into a good printer I'll go with somebody othert than HP."
3,The buying isn't over!,"This product does include the ink or the USB cable. I contacted HP and they wanted to sell me one for $24.99. I did buy one through Amazon for $2.04. It's a good deal, but I was not happy it wasn't included. How do you set it up to your PC without a cable?"
3,received the printer but no ink,"The printer is basic and simple, easy to set up. However, the ad says that a #22 tricolor ink cartridge would be included. There were cartridges in the printer already installed (that means used) and they were both dried up. So, expect to invest in ink cartridges. The cables were in the box. It's not bad for an affordable printer. I only need it for small jobs, so it will work for me. I think it will be fine with new ink cartridges."
4,good resource,"While translation websites are helpful, there is no substitute for a good book. The Berlitz Slovenian/English dictionary is well organized and contains phrases that will help you get around while in Slovenia.Unfortunately, there seems to be a lack of good translation guides (except for websites and/or learning the language.)"
3,"Finally, Marinetti in English","An interesting compilation of Marinetti's best texts and poems, translated for the first time into English. It will help us to understand why Marinetti can be called the founder of literary avant-garde."
4,Eine Gute Idee,"I got this CD two days after I saw the Puhdys in concert last summer in Frankfurt. It's great even if you don't speak German fluently - the lyrics are clear and easy to sing along with. There is something of a techno/disco undertone, but most of the songs are more like our rock oldies. Everyone I know whose really listened to it has enjoyed it, from my German teacher, to my sister, to my friends, who know no German whatsoever."
1,Video poison,"This DVD should be clearly labeled as the poisonous collection of falsehoods and distortions that it has been conclusively proven to be. The claims about drugs are specious and the whole effort to create a negative image of Shepard is really vicious and disgraceful,adding further insult to his mortal injuries. The producers of this supposed news magazine should be barred from ever presenting their work as journalism--it is fraud and lies."
5,Greatest book ever,"I was given this book by my great grandmother. She said it was the reprint of the book my great-great-great grandmother had used. My 3*great grandmother had been a wonderful christian healer and swore by this book. I do not used it, but love everything I have read in it."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY and TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I feel this was the worst possible resource and I am disgusted that I wasted valuable time reviewing its content. The author is clearly unaware of any of the current topics covered on the exam because there was not ONE question that I could answer based on her book. It was disorganized and full of blatant errors both in her use of grammar and in her incorrect answers to her own ""practice test"" questions. I think that Rose Reissman (the author)must be laughing her way to the bank! It makes me ill to think that she is leading people to believe that this will help them pass the Praxis."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"Ditto. The original 81' lp is an all time favorite, so much so, that I bought a 2nd spare copy. 5 seconds into the opening track, I realised that this is not that album. I have been fruitlessly looking for the original on cd for years. I picked this one up on release day. Sure wish I had seen these reviews before getting all excited. The vocals on some of the tracks are the same guy, but nothing else is original. So sad!My brother said he bought 'hot' on itunes recently. I wonder if it is this or the other? I'm going to keep waiting, or digitize the original I quess."
3,not what i expected,"Its my own fault really, I didn't listen to the music samples provided. This was suggested by amazon as a ""Best Value"" added to my purchse of a Pink Martini album. I assumed they would be similar. This album is nothing at all similar to Pink Martini. I wouldn't recommend it as an addition to one of those albums as Amazon is suggesting. its probably a really good album if you like this kind of music, just not my cup o tea."
4,Solid Family,"This one must've been made soon after Ric Grech left Family for Blind Faith, since they still had a song in the bag Grech co-wrote (""Wheels""). By the eclectic standards of Family, many of the songs comprising A Song For Me are fairly normal. Lots of them are loud (anyone familiar with Roger Chapman's vocals knows what that will mean). A bit of jazz dabbling on a song titled ""Hey Let It Rock"" just to throw us off. The title cut is long, loud, aggressive and a bit ragged, but they had the chops to pull it off.This would probably not be anyone's favorite Family disc, but it is solid & worthwhile."
2,Well written Fiction,"After being witness to many of the incidents that happened in Panama, I am shocked to read that the items printed are written as being true. I think that this book can help alot of women who might actually have been sexually harassed but can not be a guide to the military's judicial process. False information can only be regarded as lies and should not give other military women cause to fear the system."
4,Flawed DVD with essential film clips,"For Your Love - From Yardbirds to Zeppelin - is a flawed DVD of very good performances. Many of these clips are unnecessarily tinted blue. One video does not match the soundtrack. However, with all those problems, this (so far) is the best resource for these essential bits of Yardbirds (and early Led Zeppelin) history. You do, in fact, witness the very BIRTH of Led Zeppelin in the concert footage on the last four selections of this DVD. Even better than that, it gives us a wonderful original Yardbirds version of ""Dazed and Confused"" (in a live performance) with Relf on vocals.So as far as I know (as of 2011) this DVD is the best available for this material. I certainly hope that this material will be given a cleaner and better-documented rendering at some point in the future. The Yardbirds certainly deserve better than this DVD but, as flawed as it is, I am very glad to have these performances."
4,Glorified Bootleg,"The positive is that you just get the music. No talking heads and no incomplete songs.While the video transfers are sharper than my bootleg versions of the same songs, there is a strange blue cast to the black and white clips, making them more blue and white.It would have been nice if the packaging told you which shows the clips are from. Fortunately, the packaging on my bootleg DVD does.All in all, if you are a Yardbirds fan, this is probably as good a DVD collection as there is. It's not perfect, but these tracks may not exist in much better condition."
4,Nearly as good as the first....,"And that's saying something. The second volume in this series focuses more on straight-ahead jazz sounds, less on the fusion aspect. Richman is an intriguing soloist and he surrounds himself with the creme de la creme of LA musicians. A real treat, great soulful playing in a live setting."
4,Luck is what you make of it,"Book four of this series finds Ki and Vandien far to the South, trying to make a living as teamsters in unknown territory. Breaking their own rules, they take on passengers and find out more about this region than they wanted. If you liked the first tales of this egalitarian couple that started in the outstanding Harpy's Flight, you should enjoy this adventure. Characters are complex, alien races abound, conspiracies and oddities are everywhere, and Ki and Vaiden's relationship continues to change and grow. I only hope that the author, now writing as Robin Hobb, will one day return to the world of Ki and Vandien."
2,Fair,"Once again, the book was not very entertaining. I love the author but found myself more than a little bored."
2,Well!,My Family was involved in the Lindbergh Kidnapping and I was very disappointed in this DVD. It showed very little of interest and a very small amount of newsreal footage. I think I could have put together a better presentation.
5,my review,"arrived on time, as described and in excellent condition.a wonderful book, well organized for expansive review."
2,If the test is anything like this good luck,"The questions are convoluted like another reviewer states.If you memorize the book, you'll be in good shape. Theseobstruse answers are stupid and have no application to thereal world. The straight forward questions will be recognized by all. If the test is like Bratton's onemight stand a chance. God save family practice it it's anything like this."
4,Solid review,"I used this for board recertification and I do think it was very helpful and would strongly recommend it. My trivial complaints: 1) The wording of some of the questions was fantastically convoluted. Fortunately the board exam questions were straight forward and did not require sentence diagramming. 2) There is tremendous variability in difficulty between chapters. 3) They should jettison the humor as it is forced, unfunny and as a result of stopping and thinking, ""Oh , yeah, I haven't heard that one today,"" slows down the text. 4) I really hated the political and politically correct commentary."
3,OK,"the game itself is a bit on the dragged out side. Typical of the genre (RPG), but slow going. Item shipped quickly."
5,Best LOTR Game on PS2,"Simply put this game is easy to play, fun and challenging. LOTR story lines set in a well made RPG. Many hours of game play will be required to beat this game due to the length of the game. Give this game a try it is worth while and a fun title for your PS2."
4,LoR Third Age good for thumb clutzes,"LOR Third Age is and addicting game. The story gets a little cheesy at times, but it is worth hours of entertainment. It is great for those of us who like to be involved in the story of video games but don't have the thumb dexterity to hit x, o, L1, right left at break neck speed. It is fun to build characters' skills and abilities and decide how exactly to administer the process.I wish there were more fantasy or comic themed games that didn't involve super-fast fighting - where I could make intellectual decisions that impel interesting action."
5,LOTR for FF X fans!,"If you enjoyed the linear game play of FF X, then you will love LOTR: The Third Age.This is about the ""other"" hero's untold in LOTR world, it is a fun and interesting game.A must have for all D&D; or LOTR fans!"
1,The Most Boring Game! Get Other LOTR Game Instead!,"I never noticed that this was an RPG game. I thought It would be cool like the other LOTR games, WRONG! I hate RPG games because you just select an attack from your menu then attack your enemy then the enemy attacks you and you do this over and over again until your opponent dies! This game is so repetitive! Buy another LOTR game instead, or buy Battlefront 2 coming NOV. 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am both a SW and LOTR fan, but this game is very dissapointing!"
3,"Worth renting, not buying","this game was utterly captivating the first hour. but then it fell into the same routine: use an armor-weaking item and killevery1 in two seconds. you could do this the whole game. the storyline was ok, there werent enough things going on with the characters. only near the end did the party finally split up and the story got a tad more interesting. the fights were also VERY easy, even the bosses. unlike final fantasy, you could beat this game in a few days of casual playing. by the way, SAURON WAS UNBELEIVABLY EASY. worth renting."
5,This is the real Lord OF The Rings,"The new Lord Of The Rings The third age gives you the same pleasures of the movie,It gives you your special characters to help the fellow ship finish their quest to destroy the ring.Play As good or evil,Ride horses and walk around middle earth to beat the greatest lord of the rings games ever."
3,The Candyman knows games,"I'm the Candyman and I know what a good game is, now i will be generous and give this game 2 stars now i would suggest u make this game like the other lotr games but since you can't cause you already made it make another one and make it better. I'm not sayin the graphics stunk no the graphics were the bomb the action was OKAY but make it like the other lotr games they ROCKED!!!"
1,Not Worth Spending your money for,"This game is so bad. It doesn't have good graphics, I'm surprised. The whole idea is plain stupid. If you're going to make a game make sure people actually think it's fun! I've gotta say, the first day I got it they helped you along the way... but then they let you explore and the people would stop you anytime and talk about random things, even if you were in battle! Also when you are in different places orcs would come out of nowhere. You'd be looking in at a rock or something and then all of a sudden an orc pops right out. It's doesn't have very good battle arrangements either. People this game is not worth spending your money for, honest! If you don't believe me than you are making an awful mistake. Choose what's right.....choose not to buy the game."
1,"D & D, not an extension of the previous games","This game is not what you might think. It is well done. The graphics are fine. The characters are appropriate. The problem is that the packaging, timing, and makers (EA) implies that it is another swordfighting battle game like ""The Two Towers"" and ""Return of the King"". It isn't. It is like Dungeons and Dragons. You have hit points, moves lists, and stuff like that. It is turn based, making it not much more that a dice-based strategy game with good visuals."
1,A Poorly Made Game,"This game stinks to high heaven for many reasons. First of all people don't want to play a game like this one, because its like playing checkers. You have this guy attack this other guy and its boring just to look at that. The only impressive thing on this game is the graphics. To make this game more impressive is to make all the characters independent and let them have a little more freedom fighting. To make a well made game you have to think about what the player wants instead of how you make it. For instance, the player wants a game that has more exploration from a battle, ways to get a character stronger, and use out of this world imagination. To all who are reading this review I suggest you never buy this game."
1,Another Bad Lord of the ring Game,All the Lord of the ring games are stupid but this one was really bad. The grafics are ok and the controls take a while to get used to and by the time you do it gets boring. Dont buy anthing that has Lord of The Ring on it because in a couple years all of it is going to be worth nothing.
3,Okay but still fun to play,"In this game you are not any of the characters from the movies. You do fight alongside them like Gandalf for example. In this game you visit all of the areas that the Fellowship travled to like Moria, Helms Deep and other places. I thinl the story is bad that you are just following the Fellowship and you are not actually those characters. This game can also get kind of boring because you choose how to attack, or defend, or heal instead of running around and fighting people. This game was a little bit of a dissapointment but I still play it to relax and have fun."
3,Became bored too quickly,Graphics were terrific. The Balrog was particularly great. After Moria though I quickly became bored with this game as I ran around and fought the same groups of creatures over and over again. This game moved too slowly for me and I lost interest.This game is in no way like Return of the King and Two Towers for PS2. They were more action-oriented while this is not.
2,Lord of the Dissapointment,"I really love Lord of the Rings and i thought this game was going to be awesome. I was sorely dissapointed. The characters are bland and unless you read the books a few times you would not even know who they were. The graphics are ok but nothing spectacular. Now for the gameplay. There are relatively few enemies in the entire game because they could only use enemies from the movies. Even though middle earth itself is vast the quests and missions are fairly linear and you often run around just looking for treasure chests to update new armor.The only good part is the combat itself which is like final fantasy..exactly like final fantasy. To conclude, i only recommed this game to fans who cannot live without LOTR. Otherwise if you are an RPG fan like myself, skip this one or wait until its in the used bin for cheap."
2,Boring and Repetative,"I have all the LOTR games and play them with my son. The characters don't interact with their surroundings, you stand there waiting to be attacked and can do nothing about it and wait your turn. We like to hit all the buttons and do the combination moves in the older LOTR games. Since when do Dwarfs do magic? My 10 year old son won't even play in the co-op version with me anymore and I've only completed 10% of the game. What an expensive disappointment. I do like the music and graphics."
3,This is what a true RPG is people!,"First off I have to say: Where are all of you people critisizing this game saying ""This is not an rpg""...Ok people you forgot the meaning of ROLE-PLAYING-GAME. Basically an RPG is any FinalFantasy, Or other game like that. They are usually turn-based or they are real time. Real time is still you click the button and it says *Fight* and your character attacks. I guess what you are expecting is an ACTION/ADVENTURE game like The Fellowship, Two Towers, The Return of The King.I also want to say though...the thing says you can roam and it is an RPG...you can't roam and there are NO shops to buy things...Do you like chests? If you do then this is the game for you!This was an OK game...I was expecting more...but it was ok...IF you REALLY like the LOTR series...then wait untill this game goes GREATEST HITS and hits $30 dollars, or just don't buy it just because it says LOTR!!!!"
3,Very Dissapointed about this game.,"I scurried to the store as soon as I had the money to purchase this game. I absolutely adored The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. I am also a huge EA game fan.However, once I put the game in my Playstation 2, I immediately realized that this game had nothing to do with individual combat.Each fight is set up for you, per say. You are not the one actually making the moves on the opponent. You are telling the game which moves to make.While roleplaying is a nice thing--I was severely upset at the layout of this game. Had I known that I would be unable to play individual characters--who were doing more than running down a path, waiting for a fight, and then clicking on a series of icons to *tell* the computer what move to make (rather than actually doing the fighting yourself), I would have waited until the game was available for pre-owned purchase at about ten bucks.Fifty-Two dollars that I will never see again--and a severe dissapointment on this end."
1,What a joke,"I mean, c'mon! Did these guys ever play EA's LOTR: Return of the King? I guess the RPG aspect was lost on me, but I've played boardgames that were more intense than this tedious, repitative snore. I really missed the cooperative, actually collaborative, play of Return of the King. That two-player spirit is completely lost here as you await your turn to select an attack from a menu (exciting!) and sit helplessly as enemies attack you.Ultimately, this just a game designer's wet dream: you watch as they [...]graphically. Sure it looks great, but don't expect to be able to do anything: after each stage of endless lame battles, you unlock a ""scene,"" so you may admire the designers' prowess some more, as if the pointless cut scenes you endured during the ""battles"" weren't enough.Bah--thank God we rented."
4,Lord of the Rings: The Third Age...........,"I found Lord of the Rings: The Third Age to be a solid, entertaining RPG, personally. One that can best be described with elements of Zelda, Final Fantasy X, and Knights of the Old Republic thrown in for good measure. Yet, while it is an entertaining RPG, The Third Age has several flaws that make it an RPG that's just as easy to forget afterwards as many RPGs on the shelves these day. These flaws involve character development(there isn't any, basically) and the fact that your group isn't making history alongside the fellowship(Personally, I feel it would've been way better if you played as fellowship itself). These two things, alone, make this game feel more like a second rate retelling of the story. Even so, it's still a great game. It's definitely a very competent RPG that's played much like a FF game. The gameplay is fun, the graphics are beautiful, and it's cool to visit middle earth all over again."
2,Not Great,"This game is not what I expected it to be. I was really hoping for it to be an open battle game like the Two Towers and The Return of the King. I don't like how you have to go in to a battle similar to the Pokemon format. I also hoped you could be members of the Fellowship (especially Aragorn, Legalos, and Gandalf)But the graphics are unbelievable. Some of the best I've ever seen. I don't like how when your just walking and a battle comes up. Too much like Pokemon. I dont know about you but I hate Pokemon games. I am sticking to The Return of the King and The Two Towers. But then again I'm not a huge RPG fan. But whatever."
2,meh,"i bought this game used for [...] at gamestop and went home to try it. first i didnt know where to go and stuff but figured it out. then i got to battle parts and after a while i felt like chucking the controller through the tv! the game is SO annoying! you run into some enemies after like 2 seconds out of a battle! makes a constant pain when you also have to heal your dudes and stuff. i didnt like the combat system, as it was too boring.1) select a move2) attack3) repeat until enemies deadits annoying! i was hoping you could just get a sword and actually fight like in the return of the king.also whats completely stupid and pointless, is the 2-player co-op mode. its like this: one person moves; one person fights. its not fun at all!and also, its too confusing! especially in moria. you have to find these runes, and it takes too long because the of the stupid enemies who lash out every 5 seconds!so dont waste your money, and go buy the two towers or the return of the king"
2,great graphics...but the game overall stinks,I was so excited to get this game. when i finally bought it I was extremely dissappointed. here's the 411.Graphics: 9/10 in the game you visit moria and you get to have a lot of cool palyers. the graphics are better than return of the king which is in my opinion the best of the four.CO-OP mode: on the game the players can't attack at the same time to defend themselves from emenis.Attack: you can't attack the enemy while thier attacking you. thats the biggest problem in the gamethe game would be better if the fighting mode was like that of the return of the king. thats the biggest problem in the game. the game would be pretty cool if that little thin was fixed.
3,Wearever Allegro Set,"Of course I saw the infomercial 2 or 3 years ago and thought it too expensive. I had actually went with another cookware set. Recently, I had to move back home and put all my cookware in storage... Overall, even cooking and the drain capability is superior. But the only complaint is that the boilovers as claimed is false. The drain sometimes comes off. Since I have limited space it does store well. Have not tried it in the oven. I have used metal utensils and the coating does not come off. Although the outter portion has some stratches due to slidiing in and out of the cabinet. Happy with purchase."
3,"Great History, Not Great Literature","I have an interest in Somerset County history, and especially in the route of the rail line since I travel it a good bit. (I have a camp on Lake Moxie, and the road in is the old Somerset Railroad rail bed.) Being familiar with many of the areas the writer talks about is what makes the book fun for me, but I'm not fond of his writing style. It's rather dry and jumps about---I'm often confused by his changing subjects when I think he's continuing a story. He just doesn't transition well from one point to another; he doesn't seem to know how to wrap up a subject or tale.I recommend the book because of its historical value, and if you happen to drive the Old Canada Road (Rt. 201) between Fairfield, Maine, and The Forks, or know Deadwater Road between Bingham and Moxie and on up to Indian Pond or Rockwood on Moosehead, then this is fascinating stuff."
1,Dangerous,My mother in law owns about 9 kittens. The product fell over one morning and crushed the kitten. the kittens that knocked it down were between 5 and 7 lbs. My mother in law even took extra precautions by setting it up against the wall and a chair for two sided stabilazation. If you are thinking about buying this please reconsider for something with a wider base.
3,Linder balls,"These are excellent chocolates, just don't let them get warm (which happens during shipping :("
5,"Delicious, great value","They're Lindt and it's a great value - need I say more? Not for traditional/milk chocolate lovers, though."
3,60 pieces doesn't seem enough.,"When I got it, I thought this wasn't 60 pieces, but it was. I should have ordered 120. The candy is quite good for the price. Not fantastic, but ok."
1,Cheap,Sorry but in contrast to the other reviews on this book I found it woeful. I had wanted some analysis and context to German expressionist woodcuts but there is only a flimsy 2 page written article and the rest of the book is made up of poor reproductions of a woodcuts by various artists. The paper is very poor quality and the page finish is flat. The upside of this book is that it was quite cheap but on the whole I think its a dud.
5,Nathan and Olive Discuss Father Daniel Boone,"Nathan Boone and his wife, Olive van Bibber Boone, had the kind of memories most people wish for. They remembered virtually all of the early history of Commonwealth of Kentucky. When Lyman Draper came to visit them for two months in 1851 he found them full of the most interesting and detailed memories of Daniel Boone. Not only had the elder Boone lived with them and shared his own memories, they had also lived through many of the incidents themselves, and knew many of the old pioneers -- old van Bibber was one of the earliest settlers in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Enjoyable, highly readable. I highly recommend this book."
3,Not That Great. Ok For The Price.,"I thought for the price, and because they were limiting only one per order, that I was getting a good product for the price. It really isn't that great of a product. The wooden handle is bowed. If you don't want a bowed handle, don't get this, because they aren't accepting returns for this closeout item. I guess it's ok for the price."
4,good book a must for starting clowns,i am a kid who is thinking about being a clown i have been buying almost every book on the subject. this is a good book to teach you the fundementals of clowning but dosen't cover what it takes to be a real clown
4,This is a great book for starters!,"This is a great book to begin with but I am just starting out and don't see this book as being the only book for me. This book is, however, very well written and easy to understand."
5,Excellent sound and value,"I moved up to these Boston CR65 speakers after a long run with a Cambridge Soundworks Ensemble 5.1 system. I chose these as replacements for the right and left speakers in that system, hoping they would add body and depth for both music and movies, and they did just that. Although I goth them for much less than $100, I rate them an excellent value at twice that price.Playing music in stereo, they are full, rich, and detailed. I appreciated the balanced sound - not boomy or tinny like some small speakers, and the detailed bass is simply amazing for the price range! In movies, they worked nicely with my CSW center and surrounds, not overpowering but adding needed depth and midrange."
4,Bosch Alternator,I got this alternator as a direct replacement for the Galant 4G63T engine. The lower mount needed alittle filing down for it to fit properly. After installation the unit charged perfectly at 14.2 - 14.8 volts and peaked at 15.2 volts with the battery off. I prefer a new alternator than a referbished one.
3,close range scared deer,Used it bow hunting. Scared doe s big time. They did not like it. This was in woods next to corn. I haven't tried in in a while. Going to try now with distance with riffle...jury still out
1,disapointed,I didn't realize all I was getting was a piece of cardboard! The item came in a big box so I thought it was going to be a Styrofoam body on metal legs.
5,Fairy tail,"Fairy tail is an awesome anime. If you like wizards and magic, then this anime is for you. The episodes are not only full of action, but also contain humor. Although the dubbed version isn't too bad, I still prefer the subbed version."
5,Great Series,"I've watched this on crunchyroll since it was first released and it is one of my more favorite shows that are currently airing right now. This English dub doesn't surprise me as it's well translated and the casting wasn't too bad either. Funimation is definitely the brand of Anime that I like. Still, this serious is a mixture of hilarity and randomness topped off with a very serious story. This series is by far one of my favorites."
5,A Fresh new face in the Anime World,"Fairy Tail, by far, is one of the best new animes to come out in years. Fairy Tail started in Japan almost a year and a half ago. Since then, it has become one of the most popular animes in Japan and America. The Story is gripping, the animation is of the highest quality of any anime going these days, And this one is almost perfect for the whole family (I say almost because in Japanese, there are a lot of boob related jokes. I know that is not everyone's cup of tea so fair warning). If this is a random buy, you won't be disappointed. If you are a long term fan, IT COMES WITH BLU-RAY AND DVD!!!!! I already have this one ordered. I hope this helped your decision."
2,Not too good,"Compare to the last air bender this anime is not very good. The drawing is awesome, but the story is fighting and fighting. I got so bore I have not even finish the 1st one yet."
4,ONLY REVIEWING IMPULSE,"I am only reviewing IMPULSE, the nora roberts entry. I got this book out of the library, where it was a standalone large print.Thought this is early roberts, it is extremely charming and holds almost everything I love about her books. The heroine is strong, but doesn't know it. The hero is romantic, but diesn't know it.There is a wonderful backdrop in Greece. There's a bit of the 80's ""masterful male"" about it, but not too much.My only problem with the story was that it was short. Well, and they had casual sex. Can't do that these days. But for its length, it was a great read!!(*)>"
2,Only partially useful,"The Idiom Advantage promises fluency in Speaking and Listening. But the book comes without the CD, something that I consider false advertising."
2,Idiom Advantage,"The book has a lot of written pages; I thought that the product would be better, so I felt disappointed."
3,a bit outdated,"some of the idioms are good -- but there are always two or three in each unit that i have to tell my students, ""this one isn't really used anymore."""
3,(Not) Good,"Let me start with some positive points as the Merkin Dream guys seems to know how to create music. Its electronic, lo-fi music that will work best just for the background music.But if you are looking for downbeat / low-tempo jazzy lounge music kinda CD to chill out, then this is NOT for you. I'll define it as a Indie/Lo-Fi music that CAN have dry effect instead of chilling out feelings. Also the music is more electronic."
1,Scrap it,"Don't buy this album. You would have to have pretty drab music taste to like this generic, emotionless, tired, garbage. Merkin Dream is clearly ripping off any worthwhile downtempo group that they find fitting (ie. Massive Attack, Air, Everything But the Girl), plus there is no vocal talent in the 3 songs they actually sing in. Someone thought Track 7 was funny or cute because a robotic voice says, ""Does my hard drive turn you on?"" What is wrong with you people? If you want decent robo-pop music, try Kraftwerk, Figurine, or even Ladytron.My advice to Merkin Dream is to stop making music because you're brainwashing poor children out there into thinking you're something good."
3,"Good, but not classic","I expected a lot out of this album after reading the other reviews posted. The album is definitely good, but nowhere near great. A lot of it, to me, sounds like Radiohead's ""Kid A"" release, with many tidbits of sound put together to form a ""stream of conciousness""-type of recording. The journey the album tries to take you on is rather random, but the mixing of so many different styles and sounds is definitely worth a listen. Not my exact style of music, but a very talented duo nonetheless.If this genre of music is what you're into, check out Four Tet's ""Rounds"". Musically similar, but with a bit more defintion (for lack of a better word) in where it's trying to go. To really blow your mind, pick up Nightmares on Wax ""Carboot Soul"". One of the truly great albums of the past few years. Second only to St. Germain's ""Tourist"", really, but what could possibly compete with that release??"
2,Manipulative,"Though well made, the movie is manipulative, really leaving more questions than answers. The narrator is extremely vague, -- ""certain people"" ""they"" among other euphemisms -- refuses to include other points of view, making it ipso facto propaganda, and plays more on the viewer's emotions than anything else... Part of it is a pro-illegal immigration manifesto. The actual phrasing of the Geneva Convention is manipulated too -- in the actual document, it says that only those who fight under a uniform are entitled to it's protections. The documentary claims that all people are, regarldess... Overall, it's basically a documentary with some a few valid points but overall just well-made propaganda."
4,Unconstitutional - The War On Our Civil Liberties,Good movie. A must watch for anti-Bush crowd. Sad direction we're headed with this guy in the lead.
4,"Unbalanced, But On The Mark Nonetheless","As some others have correctly pointed out, not all things in this documentary are valid. For example, the Geneva Convention is taken out of context and there is a definite pro-illegal immigration stance -- not surprising for an ACLU project. However, the few factual accuracies that are included in the film do support the premise made that the Patriot Act is a sham. This film should be required reading and subject to debate in every high school civics class.After you've seen the film, give $30 to the ACLU. They deserve it."
5,Unconstitutional,"People, you need to educate yourselves on what your government is doing to you. This is the start of a great read."
3,Its OK...,"There nothing that I particulary disliked about it, but there are other recordings of these pieces that are much better, Celibidache and Solti realy stand out."
2,Not what I expected,It didn't cook steaks like I expected it to. Hamburgers did okay. I am now looking for a cast iron one.
3,Better sequel but...,"Unlike The Pretender that had a somewhat ridiculous plot, this story moves along at a brisk pace. The spy/intrique carries the story through and immerses us further into Celeste Bradley's misfit world.Unfortunately, she draws out the romance to equally ridiculous levels. The idea that these two observant people were not able to see beyond their disguises boggles the mind. Clara seems incredibly dim to automatically assume everyone wants her dead, especially Monty/Dalton. The characters never seem to ask the questions they should. And the romance resolution takes another useless 20 pages to tell. One would think Bradley was so in love with her world she refused to let go and made the characters stupid just to entertain her.Yet, I look forward to see what happens with James, Rose, and Nathaniel as well as the rest of this motley crew."
3,Average,"This book was just a average ok read for me. I just could'nt seem to care one way or another about the main characters. Usually while reading a great book I become so involved in the book that when it's over I am disapointed and wish I could read it all over again like it was the first time. I just did'nt feel anything about this book. It wasnt bad it wasnt great it was just ok. Dalton and Clara just seemed a little on the bland side for me. And when Clara was acting like a ninny around Dalton to prove he was not the real artist I felt like the author never really came through. It served no purpose. There seemed to be no background to the characters, no depth. Dalton seems so reserved throughout the whole book till the last chapter that I felt the story could have been so much better."
1,What a waste.,"I had too much difficulty getting into this story. There was verbage and verbage and by chapter 3, I tossed it. Too many good books out there to waste time on this mishmash."
5,Liers in Love,This was the frist book of Ms. Bradley's that I picked up and I couldn't put it down. I stad up all night reading it for a just had to finsh it right there and then. I is filled with thrills and romance. This isn't the frist book in her Lier's Club books it the second and I do hope that you will read the frist on in this serces as well as all of the others. Once you start reading these books you will be hooked. Enjoy The Imposter and all her other books.
3,I liked it,"Didn't like it as much as the first in this series, but liked it enough to make me want to read the next one. The story was good, but the romance in my opinion took forever. Its not until the middle of the book they finally get together, and when they do get together, It still seems to take forever. It was a little rough for me. To wait that long and then have it that fast without much kissing, was a bit much, and later it was even rougher.But I loved the spy story (was a tad bit drawn out but not to bad), was a very different read, taking you this way and that, with it changing all along the way. It is a page turner, you will read this one fast. I skimmed over the sex parts myself, except the fruit parts. What they do with fruit is pretty sizzling. Its not a keeper for my library, but it is worth reading."
2,There are better ones than this.,"""High Altitude Swing"" has some good spots, just not enough of them. If you just have to have every swing cd out there go ahead......otherwise let this one pass by. The soloists aren't anything special and the arrangements bring nothing new to the old standards. You're better off with Bill Elliott if you like originals or Ray Gelato if you like standards."
5,I love this CD,"I think that this is one of the best swing Cd's and i like the version of ""it don't mean a thing""."
2,"Poor Musicianship, Poor Arrangements","Of all of the big band CDs out there, this one is in the bottom ten. The standards here, are all well known - and very heavily Calloway-oriented. But with the poor singing of Warren Lovell and the caucophonous brass work, this CD cannot hold its own. Oh did I fail to mention they only have one original song?"
1,Yawn....,"This album just didn't click for me. I like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Indigo Swing, and some Squirrel Nut Zippers.On this album, the playing seems mechanical and not inspired."
1,Low Flying Flop,"Terrible arrangements, disjointed musicians. If you're at all serious about music -- don't buy this."
2,Easy to Read - Hard to Find Info in Book Quickly,"The reviews gave me a heads-up on the book and for the most part they were right. I actually read it cover-to-cover as night-time reading hoping I would just happen on the exact tip to break through some genealogy brickwalls. Excellent if your brickwall is after @1840 or 1850. Lots of tips. Not much if your brickwall is (as mine are) prior to 1840 or even in the late 1700s.The book is indexed but no surnames. One reviewer posted that it could use the title of each ""brick"" put into categories. I agree it needs something but couldn't come up with what category(s) I'd want to see.A nice read with a few gems here and there. Again, if your brickwall is after about 1840 -- then go ahead. If before then, you might want to look elsewhere. But I did enjoy reading it. Some really interesting info -- you wouldn't believe why SOME of these ancestors were so hard to find. :-) Requires out-of-the-box thinking. And some of the best stories in the book."
3,"Inspiring maybe but not a ""solution""","Filled with short stories about how other folks broke through the inevitable brick-wall, this is a nice source for some out-of-the-box thinking. It you are looking for inspiration or brainstorming for new ideas, you might find this book right up your alley. However, you are are looking for real instructions, you are probably going to be disappointed with it. It isn't well organized so the story titles won't help you decide which ones might help your particular situation. Is this a must-have book? No. But as a general interest read on the subject with the possibility of sparking a new avenue for your own research, it is suitable."
3,worth a read,This book explores end time events through a biblical Jewish worldveiw and interpretation of the scriptures. Whether you agree with the conclusion the authors come to or not it is still worth a read.
1,Terrible,I bought this online and it did not go into the shallow end of my pool which is a simple 16 x 40 foot pool. The dealer said that all the ones he sold last month did not work. The company made me try a list of different things that did not work .. The thing is a piece of junk and I lost my postage money over $60 (receiving it and sending it back). DO NOT BUY THIS!
5,Very encouraging and enlightening...,"The author gave many thorough and enlightening illustrations on how communication breaks down & what to look out for. After reading & self-examination, one could identify the areas for improvement & learn from the methods prescribed. The first part identifies the types of relationships within the family. The second on developing God-honouring relationships, dwelling mainly on the subject of communication. I was very much enlightened by the types of circuit jammers within the family. Part three expounds on sustaining Godly family relationships. It explains why families fight & how to turn discord to concord. I am very much encouraged & edified from the reading of this book."
5,Nice Lime Scent at a Great Price,Smells much like the old spice lime after shave which has been discontinued. Awesome product at a great price (compare to Trumpers Extract of Limes @ 50 dollars for 100 ml)
3,"One note, but limey.","This is a mild one-note aftershave which I liked. It smells EXACTLY like essence of lime mineral water (Crystal Geyser Sparkling Water Lime, 18 Ounce (Pack of 24)). Unfortunately, the price is way too high for something that compares with the Clubman brand."
4,Nice gift,"This set contains spoon, fork and little book. In the book are nice pictures of Mickey and his friend having breakfast, lunch, dinner... Spoon and fork are good for little hands. I've bought it for my 18 months old nephew as a gift and he likes it."
4,SporTube,"I used this case to transport shotguns on a Delta flight for a Regional Trap Shoot. It worked fine - no problems with the guns, Delta or TSA. I could also pack other accessories in the same case along with my shooting clothes. I bought the extra handle - which is a must - it has wheels, so I was able to pull it everywhere with ease. To my amazement - the Airlines didn't destroy it - in fact it still looked new after the round trip - and all contents arrived in perfect condition."
4,Great protection!,"This case is great - nothing else can compare with the protection that it affords your expensive ski equipment during travel. The optional pull handle that atttaches to the nose of the case should make a significant difference, as pulling the case by the handle that comes standard isn't comfortable.I agree with other reviewers that for the price of this case, the pull handle should be a standard feature.Recommend for airline travel and shipping. Note that new check in costs in some of the airlines."
4,GREAT CASE FOR A GREAT PRICE,"This case is perfect for the price. I use it for traveling with filmmaking equipment and it's sturdy, rolls easily, and is cheaper than any other type of similar hard case. The best thing is it's really light so I can fill it with more equipment and still come in under the 70lb weight limit. My only dislikes were I had to order the front end carry handle separately (you need it for comfortable walking, but it really should just come standard with the case), and the little cotter pin you use to lock the case together was promptly lost by TSA the very first plane trip I went on. Unless Sporttube changes their design by attaching a small cable to the cotter pin, I suggest you add your own before taking it on any flights or you'll be walking with a loose case."
5,This product is excellent! It makes my hair ...,"This product is excellent! It makes my hair feel cleaner, and I don't believe I've used it enough to say whether or not it helps remove oils from my hair, but I do know the smell is TERRIFIC! It definitely makes me want to yell out """"YES!"""""
4,I was honestly surprised at how well this ...,"I was honestly surprised at how well this shampoo actually worked. It has a wonderful scent that stays with me all day. It lathers great, and I only need to use a small amount. I will definitely keep using this product, and recommend it to my family and friends. Although I didn't experience anything like the girl in the commercial, I give it two thumbs up."
4,Quickly becoming the standard,"This book is quickly becoming the standard in the field of engineering and technical graphics. The book presents in a very clear and concise way, (sometimes in a longer manner than needed) both traditional and modern approaches to technical engineering design fundamentals and graphics: Hand layouts and drawing views vs. CAD software usage.The language of the book is provided in a clear and understandable way, which students can comprehend. There is also substantial instructor support materials for the classroom. At over 1000 pages, the book covers areas that may that be needed in a modern progressive engineering classroom, but they are available for reference. A big negative, the price for the students."
3,ConstructionManagementMajor,"This book is alright. I wished they had more examples of complex orthographic drawings with their isometric drawings because that is where I'm struggling the most. I use this book for our graphic class at University of Houston, Texas. It is a good reference book. Good luck."
3,Espresso cups,These are ok but I should have looked closer than I did at the discription instead of the picture. The picture is very big so I as-u-me d that they were bigger than the 4oz that they are. They don't exactly hold a full espresso shot. Silly me.
2,Missing a cup!,"This product would have rated higher, if it actually came with all 4 cups. I was surprised when the recipient opened this on Christmas morning to only find 3 in the box. Otherwise, these are nice cups and so far appear to be good quality."
4,Works Great,"I purchased these to go with myDeLonghi EC155 Espresso Makerand they work perfectly. Cute, perfect height.. the only downside is that the metal part around the bottom, attached to the handle, tends to slide around or come off during washing. Easy to put back on though, and I haven't had any issues with it during use. I definitely recommend these cups."
4,Awesome Espresso Cups. Just check for deep scratches.,These are very nice Espresso Cups. The sizes are just perfect and feels very nice in my hands. Handles are very sturdy and will not pop off unless you use lots of pressure. I had to return the first set cause two of the cups had deep scratches which looks like a small crack. They are easy to clean and hold up very well.I would recommend this to a friend.
5,"To be enjoyed, not analyzed","The depth of feeling and power of this music took my breath away and left me wiping away tears, sometimes of sadness and sometimes exhilaration. These songs, for me ""Press On"" especially, will hook you, make you stop what you're doing and touch your heart. No need to dissect the arrangements or analyze the artist. Just be nourished by it. The album is aptly named, in my opinion, since there is a difference between closure and solace, there often being no closure for lonliness and loss. This music conveys the distinction well. I would buy this one to compensate the artist for providing such an exquisitely beautiful way to get in touch with feelings of value."
5,What a Tremendous Talent,"This music is so soulful that it takes my breath away. Robinella's voice is full of feeling - pain, joy, loneliness, longing - it's all there. ""Down the Mountain"" and ""Whippin Wind"" are but a couple of the gems on this wonderful CD. I'll be seeing Robinella this week in Madison, WI, and can't wait! Buy this CD and hear for yourself how much passion and feeling music can hold."
4,All about the love,"This album is all about love/loves. The first few songs of this album surprised me as a shade dark. However, upon a second/third listen, I found them lovely and evocative. This is an album of honest worth, beauty, & humor. Though this genre (Americana?) is not my average fair, I found such resonance w/the stories/lyrics & complementing melodies/music, that I purchased multiple copies to share with all my far flung immediate family members, & a few long time friends, as a New Years gifts. No doubt this was an overshare on my part, but I suspect I will be reaping favorable rewards & responses through out the years to come. With this album I wandered outside my usual daily comfort zone w/an open heart & mind, and found a slice of a refreshing garden of another life."
5,Etherial,Robinella's performance on this work is simply wonderful. With the voice of passion and innocence Robin entrances the listener with a delightful mix of sounds not easily catalogued. Her faith background is fully incorporated with the mountain music of America very evident. I highly recommend a listen to this lovely music.
3,All polished up and headed in the Wrong direction,"Nice, but not special. Overproduced, overarranged (if that's a word) I guess this is a mainstream Nashville sound. Too bad. I liked her and the CC String Band's earlier recordings."
4,Pretty good,"This book is alright. It could give more updated photographs, as some of the airlines' colour schemes were outdated years ago."
1,"Interesting story line, but weak translation","While I enjoyed the musical history of Baroque opera in Naples, I found this book to be a tedious read. In part this was because of an awkward translation and weak editing. I grew tired of the poor grammar, misuse of words, and even a few misspellings. (For example, a character is named ""Vito"" but is mentioned in the next paragraph as ""Vico."" Such things are trifles, but they are distractions from the writer's intent.)This book was originally advertised as a novel, not as a romance. If you're looking for a period romance, you may enjoy this book. If you aren't a fan of bodice-rippers (I'm not), save your time and money."
2,The title does not reflect the ability,"This book reminds me of Suskind's 'Perfume' on many accounts. Both are translations into English. Both are set in Europe of the 18th century, and both have left me disappointed. The Virtuoso is the story of Italian noblewoman Carlotta and her love/crush on the male soprano Gasparo, whom she remembers from her village childhood. So far, so good. But i find that i can't feel anything for any of the characters in this disjointed book. De Moor is a trained singer, and fills the book with technical terms. A background of music study at tertiary level meant i could understand what she was writing, but i didn't feel that it added anything to the story. I couldn't help but imagine that someone without a musical background would find it outright annoying."
3,this is a good deal,"I am not English sorry for my language , Howeverthis is a good deal..but..there are a few consthis machin spends water really quickly....I have to refill water frequently.and makes much noise..other than this it ok"
2,Worked for a few months.,"I had a Waterpick that lasted over 10 years until the hose crumbled one day. The pump, etc., is working fine. So, instead of buying the replacement hose, I decided to purchase this inexpensive model. It worked fine for a while, but after a few months the pump lost all of its power. It still runs, but I would be better off using a water fountain at a park. Besides that and the small reservoir, which I expected, and the crow bar you need to detach the reservoir from the unit when you need to refill, it is fine. I will never buy this brand again."
5,Great product and service,"It's the best I ever used. It does the job in a less noisy manner, and a perfectly manageable size (while others are enormous!)."
1,The lid is easy broken,"Just received this product today and was assembling the lid (Reservoir cover) to the Reservoir of unit. I thought it should be very easy to do, but with a little bit push to let the connection part of lid sliding into the hold part of Reservoir and one end connection on the lid broke. Although it is made by plastic material, but should not be broken so easy."
4,Teeth Cleaning,"We have had this product before and bought it again, that is an endorsement right there.Mouth wash, brushing and flossing first, then you wash out all the little areas that are difficult to reach. A good product at the right price."
3,Works fine. Not as strong as the last one i owned.,I dont think this one's water force is as strong as the last one i purchased. I had it for two years and dropped it on concrete and it broke. Works Fine. Cheap.
1,Returning the unit,"I should have read the reviews first! Exactly as others had said it leaks out the bottom, on button is difficult to turn, so lightweight it vibrates and travels on its own around the countertop, and I suppose I don't need to go on. Cheaply designed and made."
1,BOOOOO!!!,"My old Interplak { more than 5 years old} was still in working order . The picture of the new one was identical to the one that we had . How was I to know that the ""guts"" had been replaced with inferior products . The new one will not ""self start"" ; it must be siphoned . It does not have the same power as the old one . Shame !!!"
4,Does a fine job - I recommend it.,"I've been using mine for about 5 years (pretty good longevity, I think) - anyway, I also have a Waterpik and use them both throughout the day depending on which bathroom is most convenient (I obviously cannot stand having anything between my teeth.) The Waterpik is about 4 years old and ready for the trash (leaking tank seal, cracked, on/off button on handle sticks) - so, I'm replacing the Waterpik with another of these Interplak units. It is a good buy, does a good job and comes at a good price. By the way, my dentist recommends about a tablespoon of Listerine and a tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide in the tank each time you clean your mouth with these types of product. The result is that I have flawless gums and I'm not exactly a spring chicken."
4,Interplak Dental Water Flosser,"Excellent unit, compact and powerful. Delivery as promised. Recommend the INTERPLAK to everyone.Using this type of dental cleaning system makes your mouth feel really clean. I like to use it before I brush, and again after. My teeth feel like they've been professionally cleaned every day!"
1,made cheap,I stopped useing after buying a Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet :):)conair makes junk !!
4,dental cleaner,"We received the product in a reasonable time, at a price we felt was reasonable. It works well. We had used this product before. It was very convenient to purchase this at home."
4,Interplak,"This is a replacement for one almost like it. The older one had a substantially heavier motor, which didn't run obviously labored. But, so far the new one seems to be holding up in spite of groaning. And it cleans teeth well."
2,Who designed this thing?,Purchased the Interplak Water Jet to replace a prior one that finally expired. One bad feature is the on/off switch. It is too small and the design is such that with wet hands (you have just brushed your teeth!) it is very difficult to operate the on/off switch. It is obvious the designer never tried it.
3,on second thought,"When I first tried the interplak it gave a very weak spray on high and a trinkle on low. The next morning I thought I would try it one more time. It came with a notice that said to prime it by turning the strength knob from high to low three times. I tried that that night but it didn't do any good. I don't know what changed but when I tried it the next morning it started to spray really good. The instructions don't say it but the unit needs to be on and spraying when you turn the knob.Maybe the first time you prime it you have to turn that knob more than 3 times to get it going.It wasn't very loud and didn't leak. Can be kinda messy and you have to go by feel, but what do you expect your spraying a concentrated jet of water in a relatively small area."
3,Interplak Dental Water Jet,"I am satisfied with the product for what it cost. My only concerns, and they are huge concerns, are the reservoir and the button that is suppose to stop the water. With the reservoir I find myself refilling 3 to 4 times. With the button it requires very firm pressure for a extended period of time which tires out the fingers. And when even if the button is pressed down all the way water still comes out the tip. This is my first water jet purchase so I will wait until it breaks to purchase another."
5,Does the job,"Small footprint, takes little space; very quiet, smooth operation; water reservoir satisfactory although could be larger; very pleased so far and much superior to other irrigators I've used."
1,Interplak waterpik,"This a very flimsy unit with a a very hard switch to turn on. You have to hold the unit with one hand while attemting to turn on the switch. Not very friendly. The water storage resevoir does not come off the unit so that you can fill it under the sink, requiring aanother cup or glass to transport the water from the sink to the resovoir."
1,"Whats wrong with this product, let me count the ways.","I am sorry to have to say that this product is a flop. Bought on Feb 24, 2010... not working as of March 29, 2010. Thirty three (33)days! A complete waste of money. I have had a couple of other inter-plak water pics & they lasted a fairly long time. This one has not performed well at all. It was said to be new but I have my doubts. The control nobs were difficult to turn, the water container is difficult to remove,and barely holds enough water. I am so disappointed, Don't buy the one with the square water container."
3,"Not bad, but...","This unit wasn't a bad little cleaner..as long as it lasted. After about a year (I think) the handled started splitting apart and I had to squeeze the two halves together while running it so that the water wouldn't leak out and run down my hand. At about the same time, it began developing a little leak at the bottom of the base unit, which always left a little puddle of water after usage.On the other hand, the unit had plenty of pressure for MY mouth, the water container was sufficiently large for the volume output of the tip, and the coiled hose was sufficiently long.Maybe it's not so bad that it falls apart in a year or two. When the handle started falling apart, I noticed all the brown yucky junk building up inside. Maybe it was time to buy a new one anyway. Got a Waterpik this time--we'll see. So far I've noticed it has a shorter hose, runs quieter, has higher pressure and volume, and a larger reservoir."
2,InterPlak Water Jet,"Pretty basic item, with several different attachments. The cup holds a smaller amount of water than expected and I find I refill it before it runs out the first time in order to properly cleanse. It does a good job."
3,Interplak,"This is my second Interplak dental irrigation device. The first one sprung a leak after 8 years! The new one seems to be much lighter and occasionally has some difficulty priming, but based on past performance I will struggle through till this one, too, shoots me in the eye...DW"
2,Not happy with this product,"We have purchased many water piks over the years and decided to give this Interplak a try. Very disappointed.Resevoir does not hold enough water and is very difficult to take apart to rinse or fill. Not enough power for irrigation.Very noisy. Just not as good a product as the ""Water Pik."""
4,Good.,This product was overall a good investment for me. It works fine for the price and it's compact. I don't like the fact that you have to keep the button pressed to stop the water flow. I think it should have worked the other way (press the button to get the water to come out). I like the product but I don't use it often (no time). I would recommend it if you want something simple and inexpensive.
1,Unhappy with this product,This product stopped working after only a few weeks. I would not suggest a purchase
2,Very less effective but price is cheap,"The price is cheap. However, the water speed is not good. I doubt whether it can help build healthier gums. It is soothing rather cleaning."
2,Problem Water Jet,Had nothing but problems with this product. Followed the instructions for getting the air out of the line but it still wouldn't work properly. Finally called Conair and they sent me a different model. I don't think they make this one anymore. Maybe they were just out of it. New one works fine. Conair was great to deal with. Actually got a real person when you dialed the customer service number.
1,Interplak Dental water jet WJ6RW,"This is the second WJ6RW unit that I have purchased. The first one lasted around 4 years before the handle split. This unit had great power and was used on the middle settings or slightly lower.The second unit, just purchased, does not have 1/4 the power. We have to operate it at the highest setting which is less power than the lowest setting of our original unit. They are the same model number and look identical. The power is usless even at the highest setting."
1,Quit working after a week,"I have used this same water pic in the past .The last one one I bought locally at Wal-mart , it lasted a couple of years ,it lost its prime ,compressor would run but would not squirt water.This i Had in use a week & the same thing happened .Itwont pickup & squirt the water.Lyndel Wayne Long..wayne429@ecpi.com"
3,Interplak pro & Con,"The reservoir is smaller then I thought, and it takes awhile after turning on for the water to start flowing. The one and off switch at times is hard to operate, I do like the compactness of the product."
1,not the Galaga I know,"If you want the old Galaga, this isn't it!!I wish I had read these reviews before I bought it. As some others said, it starts out like the old arcade game but then it morphs into a 3-D type game that I found nearly impossible to navigate using the keyboard."
1,Deceptive Advertising,I purchased this game thinking it was similar to the arcade game. Boy was I fooled. Starts OK but the game is not at all like the classic arcade game.
3,A little generous maybe,Maybe my 3 stars appear generous but i stae my point of view1) To bring forth a forgotten game2) to have enhance it with 3d effects3) More levels4) hey it is an atari gameOk i still have my old atari 2600 with 50 tapes and 4 joysticks that stll work amazing no...Yes the game was transformed with the 3d process and yes it is nerly impossible to play with the keyboard.. Hummm reviewers have you ever heard of the word joystick ????GhostRider666 the spirit of vengeance
4,everbody knows that jesus christ loves ravers!,"This mix swings off the hinges from the top and stays hot as it spins all the way down! If you want to large it on your way to work or at your next house party, then this is the one for you, I don't know if I could have done any better myself, well maybe but you can't have me in your living room now can you?Big ups and mad havin it, Adam Starr keeps it fresh like zip lock, buy it! NOW!!!"
4,Terrific!,"""Hero for Today"" is a wonderfully balanced collection from the US Army Band and Chorus. There was a good selection of patriotic music, both old and new. The balance within the chorus was well executed, as was the balance between the band and the chorus. Their rendition of ""Hymn to the Fallen"" was thoughtful, almost prayerful, with a subtle choral overtone. The ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" was a fresh and full arrangement of an old favorite. ""Here's to America"" was an upbeat expression of faith in America, in good contrast to the reflective ""A Hero For Today."" ""This Is My Country"" was set with a majestic tone, while ""God Bless America"" was an upbeat expression of an old favorite. I'd recommend this CD to anyone who would like to hear both traditional and new expressions of patriotic music."
4,Hero For Today,"I heard the title song first at the memorial marker ceramony for Paul R. Smith, the first Medal of Honor recipient of the WOT. I went searching for a CD and to my surprise, found it as the title.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have found the tone quality very good. My only 'complaint' is the lack of printed lyrics.While I'm not usually a huge fan of military music, I found the lyrics time appropriate for occassional use in my social studies classes. While we have many discussions about the US policies, many of us can use a reminder of those few that are giving up so much for the many."
2,The Low GI diet Revolution,Not a totally easy read. Would prefer charts or some way to more easily choose foods to total needs to meet the diet guidelines.
3,"Grossly over-rated play, perhaps better in performance.","I bought this play script because I read that the play received great reviews in Chicago and it was about to open in New York's Lincoln Center. What a disappointment: the play is very dull with uninteresting characters; the woman who is stalked is no better developed than the average character in a TV soup-opera. Yes, the dialogue is realistic and natural, but so what? How could this play be considered so good in Chicago? Am I nuts? Well, the play received mediocre notices in New York, so maybe my New York sensibility differs from people in other places."
2,Massively Overrated and Insulting,"I went to see this play at the Royal Court Theatre in London after having heard how good it was. When I got out of the theatre, I felt like I had been called a horrible name by someone who didn't know me at all. This play really seems to insinuate that men are all in some big club together and are all out to get women. It is cheap and easy to put sexist dialogue in a man's mouth. Lifetime does it all the time. This is another silly play that portrays all women as courageous victims and all men as conflicted and brutal. Gilman needs to put down the brush with which she paints such wide strokes and take a long look at something a little harder than racism or sexism. Get real."
4,REBT Easlily Explained,"It's not a very big book, but this slender volume packs a wallop by completely and easily explaining Ellis' Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy. This cognitive therapy can be a powerful tool for counselors or for individuals to use on themselves - to learn to challenge irrational thoughts that keep one looping in the same behavioral pattern. This book was written especially for therapists, but could be read by anyone."
4,Good therapy suggestions,"This guide is short and sweet. It has tremendous ideas delivered with great clarity. I will be using the new language of Irrational Beliefs, Disputing, and Rational Beliefs. I like the section that contrasts with other therapies. This stuff works!"
3,Okay read,"The story begins at the point where the leads have been working together for 3 years. They are already attracted to each other so we get a very limited love story focused mostly on sex.Author writes well but the back story is just not believable. Hero is assistant DA and heroine is crime lab investigator. Their professional conduct is highly questionable. For instance, she is allowed to handle evidence in a case in which her friend is the main suspect."
2,Not what I expected,"I expected the story to be about ""dreamy creatures frolic[ing] as a young girl awakens to a smiling sun, passes the day with various pixies, and eventually says goodnight to a moon enchantress"" as the review says. Silly me. Besides the pictures (most of which are quite lovely), the story had nothing to do with pixies or a moon enchantress."
5,It works,"My husband has chronic dandruff, and this shampoo clears up the flakes and stops the itch. It works exactly as advertised."
2,Decent shampoo but doesn't work for me,"I have oily hair and a scalp that gets itchy a day after washing. I thought itchy scalp was just something I had to live with until I tried a shampoo from Pytho that actually controlled the itching. Unfortunately that shampoo was discontinued. From then on I had went on a search for a shampoo that can tackle my itchy scalp.I tried Garnier Dandraff shampoo, Neutrogena T-Gel, Jason scalp therapy, and even some African black shampoo. None could control the itch in any reasonable degree. Neutrogena seem to perform better, while Jason performed worse than regular shampoo.Finally tried this one called ""Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength Anti Dandruff Shampoo"" and finally I'm back to having no itchy scalp.Of course, different shampoo works for different folks. My only advice is to try the cheaper shampoo first before moving up to ones that cost 15 or 30 dollars a bottle."
5,This works!,"I have been fighting with itching and flaking for years. Tried everything thats on the market, even stuff with prescription. Nothing has helped in the long run. Found this at a visit in USA and for 2 weeks now I have had no flakes or itching. All other products I have tried have helped maybe 2 or 3 days, but this rocks and I am amazed and hoping that it will work in the long run. I read other reviews here that talked about neutrogena schampoo helped them for years, so I am holding my thumbs. WELL worth a try and the price! Don't think about it, just buy and try as fast as you can.Unfortunately it seems impossible to buy this in my homeland, so I brought enough for perhaps a couple of years or less depending on how much I have to consume."
5,Charming Movie,"This movie is a sequel to ""Not Quite Human"" which is a story about an android that has human tendencies. It is a great family movie with excitement built in and romance too."
3,Not Quite Human 2,"I bought this movie for my daughter because she she has the first movie ""Not Quite Human"". She enjoy watching the movie."
4,Good Thriller With Waise Lee at his best!,"Unfortunately, many remember Waise Lee as simply a villain because of his roles in ABT and BITH. But he plays a hardened cop with a bad hand, pursuing a crime boss(The Killer's Chu Kong) and working with a young idealistic cop, who buys it at the end. Dont expect the best film Hong Kong has ever put out, but expect a good cop thriller. Waise Lee is good, but is still pretty calm. Chu Kong is slimy as hell, and it is a little gory. Good final scene with Tsui Hark will have you rolling on the floor. This film is widely available on DVD on several web sites, so check it out. By the way: excellent music from The Killer's Lowell Lo."
4,Inventive and Brutal,"The shootouts which comprice the action on display here do not have the bullet dodging acrobatic ridiculousness of the likes of Hard Boiled. Instead they are more plausible fair but equally as entertaining. The story involves four cops confronting a hugely dangerous conspiracy, with things made more interesting by giving the hero a damaged hand which means he cannot be sure whether he will be able to fire his gun or not. The picture quality is fine."
5,A Classic,"This book is a classic for anyone into cycles or swing trading. Some of the info is dated, and forget the complicated stuff (Fourier, etc), that's not the point. The point is get in for the upswing and get out near the top and into another trade. The more and faster you do this the better. This is a must have."
1,The mathematics behind this work are pure bunk!,"Hurst's premise is that stock prices are predictable because he found a line frequency spectrum in the data. This premise is completely false and cannot be proven mathematically. To be predictable there must be repeating components in the data. If you study prices long enough you can spot cycles that seem to repeat but after two or three appearances they change or disappear.Hurst's dominance principal is your first clue that his analysis is flawed. The so called cycles vary in dominance and come and go randomly. Certainly no predictive capability there.Your probability of success with Hurst's method: 50%. Same as a coin toss. Toss the coin and save the money you would spend on this book!By the way, I have a Master of Science degree in mathematics and have spent years researching stock prices. My conclusion: trading the stock market is gambling; but the odds are better than Vegas. Keep it a hobby and don't trade with any money you can't afford to lose."
1,don't recommend this book,"It's a technical analysys book that employs a lot of wrong assumptions in order to build a trading system. For instance, it says about 4.5 years, 18 months, and 52 weeks market cycles in order to time the market, which is impossible. Waste of time."
4,Great set but I want more,"I had this as a kid, and it gave me a love for classical music. I am now getting a degree in music education, and I can say that these recording are quite good (for a VERY large mixed collection). It is not the London Symphony, but like the other reviewer said, the biggest problem was coughing.My only issue with this recording is that when possible, pieces were shortened. For example the first movement of Beethoven's 5th on the Beethoven disc, is played with NO repeats."
2,"large collection, so-so quality","This box set has a fairly extensive collection of classical music for the casual classical-music-listener (someone like me who just likes to have classical music on when reading or studying). BUT I wouldn't call the quality that great (e.g. one of the tracks has coughing in the background - I guess it was recorded at a live concert).I'm sure that there's better out there than this, but if you don't care that much about the quality then it's not a bad deal"
1,False Advertising - No FM Radio on this MP3,"Look at the ad. It says it has an FM radio. Someone even wrote a review stating how good the radio was. I did not get the unit that was advertised. Below is what Buy Accessories sent me telling me that the MP3 with the radio was $60-$70. Yet when I checked the ad again it still says that it has a radio. They never bothered to change the copy even though they have known about this for over one month.Ray,I am sorry, I was under the impression that you wanted a refund.I checked with my warehouse and the MP3 players with a FM tuner are much more expensive around $60-$70.Mary StevensBuy AccessoriesCustomer Service Dept."
4,Great MP3 & radio,This little MP3 has good playback and is fairly easy to use. Have had problems with loading music only because my computer would not connect to it. You don't have to use itunes =-- you can load any music you already have stored or on CD and the RADIO picks up great I use it to listen to ballgames being broadcast.
2,Don't bother,"This is a good product if you are not crafty at all, or plan to use them for maybe miniature furniture for a doll house."
1,God awful!,"This was my first read from Ms. Brown after hearing an interview with her on NPR. On its surface, the basic premise of her work sounded delightful to this animal lover and mystery fan, and I immediately sought her out. But after having struggled through just over half of the thin plot and pointless yammering, I'm fished. The story fails as an engaging whodunnit, the pet sleuths fail as whimsical characters and Brown falls as a writer. How did she ever get this drivel published?!"
3,Disappointed,"I love the Sneaky Pie Brown mysteries (although I find the ""Virginia is best"" attitude a bit much to take at times). I found this story less interesting than all the others. It took a long time to catch my interest and the ending appeared to be an afterthought that was tacked on. I read it in a few hours simply because I skipped much of the book. I should have waited until it came out in paperback."
2,Who Wrote It?,"My 17-year-old granddaughter and I have been reading all the Mrs. Murphy books for the last 6 or 7 years, and enjoy trading the books back and forth and discussing them. But - the latest one, ""Cat's Eyewitness,"" was a disappointment. As other reviewers have stated, there was a lot of preaching and philosophical discussion between the characters, which are Ms. Brown's own opinions. And the lesbian love affair was unnecessary. The Mrs. Murphy novels have become progressively more sex-themed, be it [...]. What began as a good series for a girl and her grandmother to share, has turned into ""Should I lend her this one?"" Of course, she's a big girl now! But I am disappointed. The murderer's identity was very easy to spot early on. I wondered if Ms. Brown employed a ghost writer for this one. Or maybe Sneaky Pie did actually write it!"
2,Mystery or political statement?,"I've really enjoyed the past books in this series but this one was a big disappointment. The story line was severly lacking and the political and social issues the author included were misplaced. Even though I agree with most of the authors views, I didn't like the way they were forced into the story and were so out of character with the prior books in the series."
2,Below usual standards.,"This series of books usually are page turners, but I found myself a bit bored with this one, it took four days to finish. To much political talking. I felt like I was being preached at instead of being entertained. The basic story line was okay, but I didn't feel that it was up to Ms. Brown's usual standards."
2,Disappointing,"I am not going to do a re-cap of this book, as many of the reviewers already have. My feeling is Rita Mae Brown is simply out of ideas. By taking Harry out of the US Post Office, Ms Brown lost a great `meeting place' opportunity, with which she is struggling to replace. The story line is a weak one, with an obvious villain.What really bothers me is the way Ms Brown is steering her characters. From Boom Boom to Alicia, Big Mim and Little Mim, Harry and Fair, I feel as if the lack of true new ideas is the beginning of the end of a promising series.I truly hope Ms Brown can get back on track with interesting stories, plots and continued character development."
3,"Different, but not necessarily bad","This book is different from the previous books in this series in that it takes a much deeper, more serious look at human nature. In the past, Browns' books dealt with these issues in a more light-hearted way.This book does a good job of furthering the story lines of now known characters, but the plot was predictable. Definitely read this book if you are interested in the journey of the characters. If you are reading this series only for the plot, skip this one."
2,I couldn't believe,"that I was actually skipping over pages in a Sneaky Pie book, but I was. Very disappointing. Too much distracting yada-yada- yada. Even favorite authors deserve an off day I suppose. Hope the next one comes back up to par."
3,Soap-box derby,"Unless you are interested in Rita Mae's pet peeves her most recent books can be a bit of a bore. Be warned! For those new to Mrs. Murphy and family, best to go back to the beginning of the series which are just about Crozet's people, animals and strange murders."
1,Only if you like serious drama and hardly any mystery...,"This book was just awful. I was suggested this series by 2 family members so I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, it was blatantly obvious who the murderer was from the beginning, and perhaps only 4 chapters even discussed the murder, while the rest of it consists of, ""my husband is cheating on me *whine whine whine*"" ""nahh, giiiirl, I would know since my ex-husband soon to be husband again slept with our dear friend BoomBoom, nick-named after her large bosoms who, by the way, is now in love with our 60 year old, Angelica, a former actress who is so much more beautiful than meeee"". If you like unnecessary women drama, talk about who the town slut is, who isn't, and Monks who own computers and use them for their business, get drunk, smoke, and do drugs in the mountains, then, you may find this book enjoyable."
2,Cringe-Inducing Revelations,"I listened to this on CD in my car and by disc 4 I literally had to fast forward past the many political diatribes and cringe-inducing scenes with Boom Boom and Alicia -- egads. From which quantum left field did that particle fly in from? Hey, Rita Mae, people generally don't pick up cozy mysteries for Limbaugh-esque views and plot twists that seem to defy reasonableness."
2,"Too Many Plots, Not Enough Substance",This is the weakest book in her series. There are too many sub-plots that don't go anywhere. Any one of the sub-plots could have taken center stage. Perhaps she is just teeing them up for future installments?
2,A let Down,"I have always loved this series, Brown is such a fine writer.This book is however not in keeping with the series we have come to know. The writer has decided to take a turn in her story lines, and this book suffers for it."
1,Inedible,"This pad thai was a soggy, mealy mess, with no flavor at all. Perhaps the worst food-out-of-a-box I have ever eaten. I have to wonder if the Thai Kitchen company samples its own products before selling them. They must not."
4,An Inspiring Book,"Recently, my wife and I both read Tony Conza's book. We found it to be very informative, inspiring, and motivational.We THANK Tony, for taking the time to write his story of success and what it has taking him to get to where he is today. I agree it takes a plan, passion and a whole lot more of PASSION. I liked the fact that he not only wrote of success, but he took a chapter and wrote on failure, and the importants of learning from them, realizing they are stepping stones to success. Also I enjoy his personal quotes and the quotes he use from other successful men. If you are looking to be motivated and succeed at what you are doing in life. This is a must read. Get it TODAY. I must say, I have never eaten at a Blimpie's before reading the book, but now I've eaten there a few times since."
1,Innacurate Information,"This book could be so much better if it contained *accurate* information about all the animals mentioned! Conway needs to do adequate research before writing, and Llewellyn needs to do their editorial homework before publishing her books."
1,Disappointment Prevails,"If anyone is thinking of buying this book is a ferret owner, don't buy this book. Conway sites the ferret as having a ""keen desire to kill"", which is not at all true. Animal Magick does not live up to its potential by only providing a brief synopsis of each animal and an occasional historical fact or story. Very little information is included on 'how to further develop this connection for startling magickal results.' Animals seem to be grouped as either helpful or harmful with very little indication of why this may be so."
2,Not worth it,I agree with one of the other reviewers. This book was not really worth the money. It talks mostly about all the different animals that there are in the world as if the author just nedded to fill up space to make a book. It offers no spells or anything specific. I was kind of disappointed.
3,I'm not too good with wires!!,"I own a 1994 4Runner and this is the only replacement mirror on the web. It does mount very nice but the wiring is beyond me. The male/female clips do not match; even if they did, the wires are not even long enough. I was disappointed to find that there was no manual included to help decipher which wire was which. So I now have a nice looking, manual, side view mirror."
2,"Games just the ""old fashion style of slots and not the newer modern slots in the casinos today!","My wife just loves the WMS monopoly casino games but if you are looking for those modern and highly animated slot machine games they are not on this disk. This is a collection of older style slots and she simply didn't care for most of them. She is hooked on the highly animated video graphic slot machines when the bonus rounds are colorful, fun and interactive.She was hoping for better and the more modern style of slots machines that are really in the casinos today but this disk was just ""old fashioned"" in her words. It is unfortunate as she would pay 2 or three times the money for the games that are in the casinos and are her favorites.You may like this disk but for her it wasn't the best one she has gotten!"
3,Let's see some of the fun games,"OK, when will one of the video game creators come up with some of the nickel/dime type slot games such as are in Vegas and elsewhere that give you bonus games and put some fun in the game.Already had Once Around, etc. etc. on earlier Monopoly disc. Unfortunaetly purchased from seller that does not allow returns. Let's get the newer bonus games on disk, or even some of the older games - Cash Crop, The Adams Family, Jeannie, Diamonds, Battleship, Jackpot Party, etc."
1,Monopoly Casino Vegas Edition,"If you purchase this game and expect it to be like the Monopoly games you play in your favorite casino, you will be very disapointed. Even though several of the real casino game titles are listed in the description, they are NOT included on this game. You will not find any of the video slot machines, 9 liners or bonus games. I am very disapointed with this product."
2,Not a 3D version of the old Breakout,"As a fan and former addict of Breakout type games, I bought this thinking it would just be a new 3D version of the old Breakout/Super Breakout games, with nice graphics. Instead it had puzzles you had to complete, and you had to run from bad guys, and stuff like that. I was able to complete the whole game in a day or two, and had no desire to play it again."
1,"Wow, terrible","What a crap fest, simply taking the ""hit"" off the album ""9-5"" you know its pure garbage. Bad songwriting coupled with EXTREMELY dumb vocals and lyrics sign this one off to the garbage heap. Since the rest of the album is either that bad or worse, skip this band and look for something else."
1,This book was more about weapons than about arms and armor.,"This book isn't really about arms and armor-- it's about weapons. If you are looking for a book that is compleatley about arms and armor, then find another book, but if you want a book that is about the history of weapons, then this is the book for you. I was looking for arms and armor, and this book didn't really have that much information on it."
2,"The T-Gel shampoo made my scalp itch, and ...","The T-Gel shampoo made my scalp itch, and it smelled really bad. I've used other tar-based shampoos before, but they didn't smell this bad, and I found them to be more refreshing. One strange thing, however, was that my hair looks great afterwards ... so I have beautiful curls and I can't stop scratching. Not exactly the look I was going for, but maybe I'm just allergic to this shampoo."
1,"Smells terrible, made my dandruff worse","Even if this shampoo had worked like magic, I would probably still hate it because of the smell. It is very chemical-like and it made my eyes sting even after rinsing it out. I heard that the smell would go away as hair dries, but it didn't. If I had had time, I would have taken another shower and used my old shampoo to try to rinse the smell out! Also, my mild/moderate dandruff was made worse by this shampoo and it didn't do anything at all to help with the itchiness. Overall, this shampoo gets a big ""fail"" in my book."
4,It works! Now the drawbacks... 1. It smells ...,It works! Now the drawbacks... 1. It smells funny (but my hair didn't after I used it). 2. It takes a while to lather it into your hair because it's so thick. 3. It has to stay in your hair for several minutes. 4. It has some really scary warnings on the bottle. It seems to work as well as similar products but I'd really need more time to assess it.
2,The Neutrogena T-Gel Shampoo is a product that ...,"The Neutrogena T-Gel Shampoo is a product that I wouldn't recommend. I've tried other Neutrogena products and enjoyed them. This product, however, was too strong and seemed to irritate my scalp rather than make it feel better. It claimed to provide added conditioning, but I don't agree. The directions caution about using it more than four times per week. Perhaps if you experience psoriasis, dermatitis, or scaling to a large extent, then this product may serve a purpose. If your symptoms are severe, though, I wouldn't recommend using this product more than four times per week."
1,Beware! contains carcinogens!,I would advise against this product. Coal tar is highly carcinogenic and banned in many countries. I would limit use as much as possible
1,"Long-time t-gel user, hate the new scent!","I've been using t-gel for years and coal tar is not a delicious smell, but it's not noxious or overpowering either. And I've gotten used to it--fond even. It the disctinction of t-gel that makes me think it's doing something special to help my scalp. This new scent, on the other hand, is giving me a headache! I may have to return it and try to find an unscented version. Neutrogena, please try again."
5,love it,I love it. It does what it says its supposed to do. No issues here. The product works great. I never thought something would help but this definitely does.
3,I don't know if a week is long ...,"I don't know if a week is long enough to review this product especially since it can be used only every other day, but here goes. Every winter my scalp gets extremely dry so I wanted to give the Neutrogena T-Gel Extra Strength Shampoo a try. It did seem to help reduce flakiness somewhat on the days I used it. It really does smell awful though, and the smell lingers. It's so strong that it almost seems to last through the next shampooing with my regular shampoo. Another thing was that all the warnings on the bottle concerned me. I don't know if I would recommend this product to others just yet. I might use it for another week or so and then make my final judgement."
1,STINKS. tar smell + old lady cheap chemical perfume.,"BEWARE of the ""NEW SCENT.""before buying online, go to your local drugstore and test the ODOR first.I'll never know how this product works because I'll never use it again.The smell of ""standard"" coal tar shampoo isn't necessarily pleasant, but at least it's just one smell. I really don't mind it.This new Neutrogena junk smells like they tried to cover the old shampoo scent with CHEAP CHEMICAL PERFUMEY STINKNESS.It just doesn't work.It's like if you've ever tried to clean VOMIT smell out of upholstery with PINE-SOL.Or tried to get DOG POO out of shag carpet with SIMPLE GREEN.Or mask SKUNK JUICE with CHANEL No.5.One smell doesn't cover the other, you just get TWO AWFUL STINKS LAYERED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.ill.."
5,Great dandruff shampoo,"I was a little skeptical about this product and when it arrived it had a strong medicinal odor, but I have very bad itchy, flaking scalp. I have been using this for about a week and it is working wonderfully. You only have to use a little. Good product."
3,Somewhat effective dandruff control - if you can stand the smell,"I purchased Nutrogena T-Gel Extra Strength ""Clean Scent"" in an attempt to control some persistent postpartum dandruff that did not respond to Nizoral or tea tree oil shampoo. While it did not eliminate the dandruff issue, it cut down on the flaking by about 40%. I think different users will experience different levels of effectiveness depending upon the underlying cause of their dandruff, and so others may find it to be a more effective treatment. Regardless, this product has a VERY strong, industrial smell that will linger in your hair for up to 24 hours. My husband has complained loudly about my persistent ""aroma"" and has requested I cease using it for his sake. I question the ""Clean Scent"" in the product description; perhaps the marketer who labeled it considers the smell of diesel to be a ""clean"" and refreshing scent."
4,Works well.,I've been using this product on the advice of my dermatologist for control of seborrheic keratosis. Works quite well. I use it a couple of times a week and it keeps the condition in check.
2,T-Gel,"I bought this because the price was good. I was using a store brand for the same item, but since the price was good, thought I would try the name brand. I hated the smell! It is so bad! I went back to the store brand."
4,Pop Culture bliss.,"Before ""Anime"" was a household word, kids were tuning in to see the ultimate mecha, Voltron:Defender of the Universe every afternoon. A sort of Holy Grail of an episode is the ""Fleet of Doom"" installment, in which the the Golion (Lion Voltron)team and the DairuggerXV (vehichle Voltron)team up to battle an evil alliance between their respective nemesis, King Hazar, and the Drule Empire. I caught part of it once when I was a kid, and was never able to catch it again.I recently got this tape, however, and it does not dissapoint. Cheesy? Sure.Dated? You bet. Fun? YOU BETTER...BELIEVE IT!I could vege in front of this wonderful escapist fare for hours right now, just as easily as I did all those years ago. In fact, I think I'll order a few more tapes and do just that."
5,A blast from the past!,"Great to see good anim. again, with a PLOTLINE! None of the dumb lack-of-plotlines that you find in the ... ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers""(how I hated that show!)Voltron is right up there with He-Man and ThunderCats.A must buy for anyone who loves 80's stuff!"
1,"Great title, bad DVD","Shame on Media Blasters! You would think after months & months of repeated delays with the Voltron Box sets, the very least they could do to compensate fans is to add this as a Bonus to the 8th & final Voltron box set...but No... they want to gauge fans for all they can. I'll stick with my old VHS copy, thank you very much. But if you didn't get it on VHS, ot the ""exclusive DVD"" from teh WEP site previously, and cant live without it, I guess you have no choice."
3,Not bad but not great. Im a voltron fan so its a must have,Its just another voltron cartoon. turned into a movie. but hey if your a fan get it its cheap yo
1,DOES NOT FIT!,"I was recommended by Amazon's vehicle part identifier and package dealer, but in the end it did not fit my truck. Call Westin to get the correct part number because Amazon can't get it right."
4,colors galore,"daugter loved this poster it fits her well, and colored up the room like she wanted, she is all about the peace sign stuff now."
1,"Won't work on 1 3/8"" doors!","There is not enough space between tracks to take 1 3/8"" doors (as advertised). The plastic adjusting wheel (flimsy) sticks out too far on the front sliding door and hits the front of the back door. Doen't work! Now I have to get 3/4"" doors or different hardware. What a struggle! Update: I just ordered item #23-500 2 Door Sliding Closet Door Track Kit, 4ft, from swisco.com that is also for 1 3/8"" doors but this hardware has a top track that's 11/16"" wider than this one. Will update again to see if this one works."
3,Removable handle?,"The handle doesn't screw in or anything, its just sort of wedged into the head of the rake. It is easy enough to fix, but once you are out in the yard raking, who wants to stop to fix the brand new rake?"
3,"Decent, but assembly required...","I received only the plastic sweeper and not the wood handle, had to contact seller who shipped me the handle...the handle attaches by forcing rod into sweeper pocket...if you look closely on the back of the sweeper you will see a single screw that looks like it does nothing. You need to remove the screw and force it into the hole that is in the base. You will see a molded indentation in the neck pocket - that is where the screw goes. You'll need to force the screw through the plastic hole into the wood rod itself to secure the rod to the base of the sweeper. Once completed, the rod will not come apart from the sweeper while using the rake. Expect to use a power tool or a lot of hand pressure with a screw driver...once assembled, the rake works fine."
4,Be Aware of the Screw you Need to Attach,Good standard rake. Don't be surprised when the head falls off when you unpack it. Head and handle are separate pieces and there is a set screw in the head that you need to screw into the handle after it arrives. I thought I had busted it before I even got a chance to use it.
4,great cd for velvet acid christ fans,"neroblastoma is the 3rd full length disc by vac, but it a rerelease of older material that cant be found elsewhere. there are a few songs that can be found on the import version of church of acid (which was there 1st full length cd). there arn't any amazing dance floor hits on this album but there are still a lot of great songs. This album has the feel of church of acid because both are rereleases of older material but has a slower feel than church. A great disc for fans of vac and anyone who likes well made industrial. Brap on."
2,Tightest Slots I've Ever Played!!!!,"Graphics and sound are done pretty well. However, on Chairman of the Board and Once Around, I blew my $15,000 bankroll and only hit the bonus round three times! $125 is the most I've hit on any one pull, and that's betting $45! I thought Atlantic City's slots were tight, but these take the cake. In all honesty, this would be a pretty decent slot sim if they were loosened up a bit. It can get boring playing a slot sim when the machines are too loose, but it's REALLY boring if you never hit! I bought this game because I enjoy the video slots with bonus rounds. It's very disappointing to never get to the bonus rounds."
1,Slot machines are not like their Vegas counterparts,"I'm a big fan of the ""Once Around"" slot. The version on here is not like the original. First, there is no music. If you spin the bonus round, there is no ""Mo-nop-o-ly"" jingle either. Overall, all of the sound effects are lackluster and rather dull compared to the real thing. The bonus round is really boring without music. Second, you are forced to play 9 lines every time (the casino version lets you play 1,3,5 or 7 as well). Next, there is no ""Last Bet"" button, for quick play. You have to resubmit a bet and press the spin button. Next, the graphics are not the same as the slot. They are adequate, but they look a little odd if you're used to the real thing. Finally, the game is slooooooow. I have a 1.2 GHz machine and this software doesn't make use of it. It takes a long time for the 5 wheels to spin compared to the real thing, further detracting from the feeling you are playing the real thing."
2,A disappointment,"I collect Monopoly memorabilia and I like casino software, so this seemed like a perfect fit. What a letdown. A previous reviewer reviewed the slots, so I won't get into that except to say that I played each of the three Monopoly themed slots for 30 minutes each and I got each bonus round once. One of the reasons that someone would buy this software is to play the bonus round, so I would think it would be programmed to come up more often than in real (reel?) life. The other games are lackluster. Nothing to get excited about. If you're looking for good casino software, try Hoyle Casino. Hoyle's is the best software by far."
4,fun bonus rounds,"this game is really fun for me, because i like slots with bonus rounds... like chairman of the board, and once around. they could of made it easier to get the bonus round like the real casino game."
4,Monopoly Casino (Jewel Case),"The game is really a lot of fun, and you play and not lose a cent in real money. I just added this to my collection so when I want to play I just pop it in and feel like am in the Casino."
1,Complete Rubbish,"I tried this unit with two different iPods in different vehicles, and the only sound it produced was a bit of whiny interference no matter which station I tuned in to. The results were very disappointing.Do yourself a big favor and look elsewhere for auto iPod hookup. This thing ended up in the bargain bin at the Good Will."
1,Only lasted for a half hour,"We bought ours at a well known electronic/media store and overpayed for it. We plugged it in as soon as we got it. It sounded great compared to the last ipod trip we bought from Belkin. There was no static and the sound was good, but it stopped working a half an hour later and that was the end of it. It never worked again. Luckily we got our money back. Good thing!!"
1,Doesn't work - worthless,"Bought this for my wife's birthday so she could play her iPod Shuffle in the car. It never worked from the first try. We tried it in a different vehicle, with the same results."
1,Totally Useless,"I recently bought this item hoping to use my Ipod in my car since it didn't have an Aux input jack in the factory stereo. I searched through all the different offerings to find something specific to my Ipod Shuffle, since most of the other FM transmitters are specific to the other Ipod's type of connectors, whereas the Shuffle plugs in through a USB connection.Imagine my disappontment when after receiving and conncecting my Shuffle to the iCarPlay, when I got no sound. Nothing at all! Come to find out, this item is not compatible with the 4th Generation Shuffle. Would have been nice for that information to be in the description before I bought it. Now, I'm stuck with it because it would probably cost me as much to return it as it was to buy it in the first place! Grandma always said the Devil was in the details. This is no exception.Oh well, now I have a car charger for my Ipod, though."
1,Still waiting for results,When I received my Monster Cable Wireless Plus for iPod Shuffle it didn't work. Monster asked that I return it to them for replacement which I did. It has been a few weeks now and I still don't have the replacement unit. It is therefore impossible to review this unit. I think this is a long time to wait for something I should have been using weeks ago.
5,So touching and sweet!,The lessons and stories in this book are so inspiring. I recommend it highly!
5,Grams of Healing,"I had purchased this book from Dr. Oliver recently at a woman's tea she spoke at and she wrote a prsonal note in each book purchased that night. I liked the book so much, I wanted a couple for gifts. There were a couple 'nicks' in both of the book bindings and the covers were a bit bent on the ones I received in the mail. They perhaps could have been packaged a bit more carefully since they are soft covers. However that does not damage the contents!"
5,This is the best product for your hair!,I always loved this product to set my hair with. It made your hair so nice with no build up or sticky feeling.
5,Awesome book!,This was a really awesome book! I love horse stories and read them all the time. This was one of my favorites!
5,"Finally, a YA horse-book that's realistic!","I love Ellen Feld's Morgan Horse books. I love them because they don't ask the reader to believe that teenaged girls can solve crimes, stop the destruction of rural America, or take a half-starved rescue horse on Monday and win the KY Derby on him the following weekend. OK; I'm exaggerating. It usually takes them at least 6 months before they win the Derby.Ms. Feld's books are realistic in their portrayal of the human and equine characters, and accurate in their descriptions of tack, veterinary care, etc.As a once-upon-a-time horse-crazy teenager grown into a horse-crazy middle aged person, and both a bookseller and tack store owner in years past, I appreciate the fact that Ms. Feld's books aren't filled with inaccuracy and improbable fantasy. It has always seemed to me that many YA stories that are, presuppose that the readers are not very knowledgeable about horses.Five stars and a bag of carrots to Ellen Feld's books."
1,Chilton's Ford Pick-Up and Bronco 1976-86 (Chilton's Total C,This manual cost me more than the price of the book. Following instructions written in this manual for replacing rocker arms on a 300 in-line six also cost me the price of a mechanic to do it the right way. Incorrect information should not be published in these books!
1,Wished I didn't spend the money,So in buying this book for a comlpete brake job on my 1979 F350. I looked at every single page... Nothing in this book had the info I was looking for. I would suggest going to a local book store and seeing if the information that you realy need is in these books before buying saves time and money. Thank god I had the general knowledge to complete the job.
5,Chilton Repair Manual,"So thankful to find the real Chilton Manual, these are way better than Haynes manuals, much more information, much more detail in the Chilton"
3,More for the Shade Tree Mechanic,"I ordered the Chilton and the Haynes manual at the same time. I prefer the Haynes manual, it is more informative and user friendly."
1,I have not receive the item,I was promissed by the add to receive the title in 30 days. Until know i have not received the title. I want to know if ot is possible to send the subission confirmation stamped by the post office.Paulo Jordo
5,Wood handle & just like my old one,"I wanted a trowel that was just like my old one...wood handle & all. This ain't exactly the same but it's the closest I could find w/o going into BIG bucks. Rivets could be better (made in China). Recommend. Also bought the ""transplant"" version.Removing the stickers is an awful experience - blow dryer technique does NOT work. Use Goop-off (sp?) or dry cleaning fluid (Angelus)"
1,An antivaccine pediatrician peddles bad information,"If you're a parent looking for quality information on how best to protect your child from serious preventable diseases, Jay Gordon is a poor source.As can be judged not only by this video but by articles on his website and elsewhere, Gordon ignores the vaccine recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics and other leaders in the field of child and public health, in favor of his own claimed experience and antivaccine prejudices.Gordon acknowledges discouraging parents from taking advantage of vaccines and (as of August 2010) has a glowing tribute on his website to the disgraced researcher Andrew Wakefield, whose flawed research and scaremongering about the MMR vaccine led to a resurgence of measles in Great Britain.Listening to Gordon will put your child at risk."
3,"taste good, but why the high price tag?","I like Tung I's beef flavor noodles. As a matter of fact I also like the rice noodle with the same flavor. What I don't understand is, while trying to look for a deal on the web, I noticed these prices (not just here, every where on the net) are just so unattractive compare to the local Asian food stores. What is up with that?"
2,It is strange,"It is very strange. Price is high while quality is low, delicious, but different from China's own products. Acceptable."
5,Really useful,"Brilliant! Combines insight and compassion, and really understands the process ofnovel writing. Full of really useful tips"
1,Worthless,"Worthless. It seems like he read some of the better books on writing then hastily put together this sloppy,shallow book. I threw it away."
4,The Executive Summary for the Digital Age,"This first attempt at a v-book by HarperCollins is good. The author's points were succinct and well delivered. He was easy to understand, paced fast enough, and clear. I think the niche it fills is for those who want an executive summary as a video.I like that Amazon is keeping track of my videos, and the video player I downloaded worked easily the first time. The resolution at full screen was a bit fuzzy, but then so are many youtube videos at full screen. Makes me wonder if there is a plan for a Kindle 3 that will let me view my videos as well as read ebooks.I'm not sure the price point is right. It did make me want to read the full book but the plug at the end gave it the feeling of an infomercial. I'm not so sure I'd pay $9.99 to view another infomercial, but I'm glad I had this experience."
3,"Ok, nothing new really...","For me this 'we all share' mentality has been around a while and not some newly discovered gizmo the author hypes it up to be. For example, when they interviewed Waz in `Triumph of the Nerds'. The good part however was thinking about how to apply it to other scenarios. The video it's self was way to short for the price and I will not be purchasing any more. I'd rather have the audio mp3..."
3,A reference,"Caution !! this book does NOT contain an index !!Beside that, this book is a collection of papers, not for beginners.You should first read Oshler's other book ""Level Set Method and dynamic Imlict Surface"" or the Sethian's original book. After reading these and you you still want more, then move to this book.This book contains plenty of imaging applications of Level Set Method. Including history of Snake Deform Method which is not mentioned in any other book. Many advantage techniques, enough 3D example, practical pseudo code, plenty of reference, will push you up to an expert of Level Set Method."
5,A fine general text,"Jones takes a very practical yet comprehensive approach to the design of valve amps and preamps. I've built quite a few over the years and was skeptical that I would get much out of this book, yet every chapter had some nuggets in it that either I didn't know or systematized previously unconnected things I did know. Hours and hours of fun. And really well-written. Excellent work, and I've recommended it to everyone I know with an interest in the subject."
5,This book is exceptionally well written.,"Morgan Jones has done a marvelous job covering this subject. Almost all of the books on vaccum tube circuits were written over 25 years ago and are hopelessly out of date. Also, he has gone to great legnths to make his book easily understandable to amateurs. This book covers both the theory of operation of vaccum tube circuits and practical designs for builders. Morgan starts at the very beginning and explains the different classes of amplifiers, modes of operation and gives valuable practical advice on tube selection, layout, troubleshooting and design. I have read many books on vaccum tube amplifier design both old an new and have found that this is by far the finest book for both beginners and professionals alike."
5,Excellent ouvrage,"Highly recommended for those interested in the tubes.Although it is in English, is easy for it is written simply."
3,Really....small.,"OK, I like this little lantern but be forewarned....it's really small. And....it is NOT bright. I get more light from a single, large conventional candle. Gets very hot (DUH) and very easy to knock over, whether on the ground or outdoor (flimsy) table. It's fragile. Bottom is plastic. The top is supposed to act as a burner but it is useless. They should have created a better vent top like on a Coleman lantern or some kind of reflecting device to create a brighter light.BUT...it's well made in the US and a clever design in many other ways. It should not EXPLODE or need constant maintenance and parts. Easy to light. Soft yellow glow. You should check it out at a camping store before you buy.I would return it if I could do that easily. Some day soon we will have better lantern options...."
4,Funny! and an education in car buying,This movie is really funny and what you'll learn about car sales will probably save you lots of money on your next car purchase. Reggie (Daniel Benzali) is a gem!
1,not a restoration guide,"As a restoration guide this is a poor guide,if you want a book that is a year one sales catalog with better descriptions this is your book.If you are looking for a book to help you to restore your car it is only good for part numbers.As far as how to restore these cars or any pictures or assembly diagrams,you will not find it here."
4,Super Bee Restoration Guide Excellent Book,"I purchased the Restoration Guide plus Interchange Manual the for our 1970 Super Bee and they immediately became an outstanding reference source for our MOPAR muscle car. Pictures and diagrams are clear and easy to see. We are still researching parts for the project and have not started the restoration process. So far, the book has been very informative and should be easy to follow."
4,Worked great..install not so great.,"This same set fits an Isuzu Rodeo, which is what I installed them on. The install procedure is very straight forward, if you follow the instructions. The only real problem was with the mini clamps for the hose fittings. The clamps are a cheap squeeze type clamp that requires you to ""try"" and slid them over the hose fittings, without the ability to actually see what you are doing. Trying to fit a pair of pliers between the coils on the springs is just about impossible. Getting everything installed took only a few minutes, but getting the clamps positioned correctly took almost an hour. Air Lift should attach the hose to the air bag and then provide you with the hardware to couple the air lines outside of the spring.On the bright side, the air bags worked just as planned. I can now tow my boat without bottoming out the springs and shocks. Yes the ride is a little stiffer, but the results are well worth it."
5,Finally the truth,"Even though I claim to exercise to be healthy, the truth is I do it to look better. Finally here are exercises devised with that aim in mind. The author's background makes him one of the few that could successfully write a book like this. The advice is solid and the book is actually fun to read. The are no promised miracles or any re-hash of things I've read and heard about time and time again. There is however a well thought out and original concept that seems to be worth trying. Since Dr. Nadler is as familiar with plastic surgery as he is with exercise, there is even a chapter on options available if exercise and diet were not enough."
1,not for me,This book seems to be missing the main points that would help me get in teh shape that I desire.too bad.
2,Errors undermine a potentially good book,"After having used the first chapter of this book in my CPE 301 class, I have found a number of errors. For instance, the book says that the 8051 command MUL multiplies 2 bytes and stores the 16 bit product across the two registers. Unfortunately, the order that the bits are stored is reversed from what the book says. This is just one example of the errors that I have found with the book. I do not look forward to having to continue to use it in my class."
3,"I had hoped for more, and less","The ""scratching"" ala hip-hop was kind of a turn-off for me, I was looking for a deeper fusion of techno or trance rhythms and ancient vocals and instrumentation. However, I still recommend this. Maybe I need to give it more time."
5,Just what in the Sam Hill is going on here!,"I am getting sick of looking at that stupid ""Release date to be announced: The release date for this video has not been finalized."" Is it ever going to be finalized? Before long, we will be going into the second year of looking at that stupid ad without being able to purchase the DVD! I would like to say something good about the film, but I won't until I can buy it."
4,Worth better,"At least 'release date to be announced' has gone!Having tried to get this from the United States, England and Switzerland, every time waiting weeks to be ultimately told they couldn't supply after all, I bought a second-hand copy, paying much more than I ever have done for a new DVD.The films are unrestored, but in a reasonable state for their age; a car dealer would probably say they were in good original condition.The website of the manufacturer is www.visionary.co.uk, from which you will see that it is long deleted and also that this was way off the beaten track for them, so a reissue is not to be expected.Neither is a great film, in my opinion, but both are entertaining and the Island of Lost Souls is important. Both deserve to be released in restored form by one of the good DVD companies. How about it, Milestone or Image Entertainment?"
3,"Nice Color, But Not The Best Fit","I liked the red color. Fits very well with my LED lighting in my case. However, I found that the screws did not screw all the way in. Just a fair warning that they not screw in all the way."
5,Great Book,"I was so very pleased to read a book that I couldn't put down. With so many ideas that are in print today, not much out there can compare to Stephanie's Journey by Brad Thomas. Brad Thomas' writing style is easy to read and flows effortlessly from page to page. I was sorry to flip to the final chapter of this amazing story. The subject matter is full realism, along with new and restored faith. The main characters are well rounded and the imagination creates them quickly. I recommend this book to anyone. Male, female, high school students and up will read this book with ease and enjoy the powerful story. This is a book with conscience, heart and hope. I look forward to more work from Mr. Brad Thomas."
4,FABULOUS BOOGIE BLUES BAND - MUSIC SOUNDS MUCH THE SAME,"Girls Go Wild is a fabulous boogie blues cd. The Fabulous Thunderbirds, with their original band members, are truly masters of this one particular form of blues music, what I call boogie blues. The real question in my mind is: Why don't I rush out and purchase a second cd of the original Fabulous Thunderbirds? Maybe it's the boogie part of ""fabulous boogie blues band"" that makes me feel that one cd may be enough. Girls Go Wild is indeed fabulous, but all of the songs tend to blend together because they all sound much the same. All songs on Girls Go Wild are boogie blues. If you currently do not own any cds by the original Fabulous Thunderbirds, and/or desire to listen to boogie blues, I definitely recommend Girls Go Wild to you.John"
3,Les Boys IV,"Most people who have seen all four movies of the Les Boys series would probably find this the least enjoyable. That being said, I have to confess enjoying the movie regardless. The movie started off great but dropped off a little towards the middle. But Les Boys will be Les Boys and the usual gags and banter were present as they were in the earlier movies. A notable absence is Ti-Guy (Patrick Huade) though. But Pierre LeBeau as the chain-smoking Meo is ever entertaining and amusing. By far, Meo has been my favourite character throughout the series. All in all a must for anyone who have seen the first three movies."
4,GrandDaddy of modern American short fiction,"Sherwood's ghost and his readers may not like the ugly pullet on the cover, but inside is a collection of wonderful writing and story-telling. If you write fiction, read it and learn.Read ""I'm a Fool"" and see if Salinger was really so innovative after all."
3,"It ain't Scaramouche, but it's good.","Scaramouche the Kingmaker was written a decade after Scaramouche, and is a sequel that never quite reaches its predecessor's brilliance, but is quite satisfying to the Sabatini completist. The story continues where the original novel left off, with Andre-Louis Moreau now embracing the royalist cause to hasten his marriage to Aline. It's a good, rousing, adventure story, but it's no Scaramouche."
5,"A Brilliant, Readable Introduction to the Logic of Sociology","This is a beautifully written, clear and understandable analysis of the diverse ways of thinking in contemporary sociology. It is written to be understandable by undergraduates who are serious about the discipline and are about to undertake research on their own. Graduate students will find it indispensible as they make very important decisions about their own careers. Reading Abbott is much easier than trying to figure these things out on your own . The author's concept of ""fractual heuristics"" is an innovative and insightful way of thinking about the interaction of different kinds of ideas in the discipline. There is too much here for me to summarize in a short review, but it is well worth reading.Ted Goertzel, Professor of Sociology, Rutgers University."
5,Bought regular trowel too!,"I bought the ""regular"" version and saw this one - how could I resist? Bottom line: I like traditional trowels with wooden handles. This ain't exactly the same as my very old USA-made one but it's the closest I could find. Rivets could be better (made in China). Quite sturdy. Recommend.HOW DOES ONE FIND TRADITIONAL STURDY USA MADE ITEMS?Removing the stickers is an awful experience - blow dryer technique does NOT work. Use Goop-off (sp?) or dry cleaning fluid (Angelus)"
5,Excellent color photos and inexpensive too,"Books about fountain pens seem to fall into two catagories useful but outrageously expensive ($70 - 150+) and small, fluff books that are reasonably priced (less than $50). Happily, this is neither. This book is reasonably priced and contains 365 (small) pages of clear, large, in focus, color photos showing familiar and unfamiliar fountain pens from all periods of their production (with emphasis on the 20th century). The captions are shorter than I would have liked, but contain valuable information about each pen. While this book isn't a starter ID book for pen collectors, it is a useful addition to any pen collectors book shelf. Two thumbs up."
5,Belissimo!,"The song ""Che La Luna"" has been used on a commercial for the Italian Open in New Orleans for several years- many of Mr. Prima's tunes are very catchy. The way he swings it out- belissimo!"
4,Very interesting and even if you are sceptical you may like this story.,"I loved this book. This is the true story of Dr. Brian Weiss' patient who when hypnotised remembers details of many past lives she has had before this one. One fact that I love is that she herself is not interested in hearing about her past lives once she has ""come to."" It makes me happy that some people are so busy living their life today that they have no need nor desire to know about anything but the present. Kind of puts the ""Power of Now"" into perspective! I myself am fascinated by all of this and am glad anytime it is talked about as part of life and not as a strange and bizarre phenomenon. I found the author's own personal perspective and discoveries fascinating too."
1,Save yourself the time. Here's a summation of the book.,"Dr. Weiss had a patient he call Catherine. She had problems. Dr. Weiss put her under hypnosis and she talked about past lives. The more she talked about them, the better she felt. The doctor ends the book with the suggestion: Trust your instints. Follow your inclinations. There's a lot going on. Was it true? Or did ""Catherine' have an overdose of ESP? You decide. But look at the doctor's web site. brianweiss.comHe's one cool dude with the dark glasses."
2,Convincing best seller,"Brian Weiss wrote a very convincing book but Laurent Guyenot in ""lumière nouvelles sur la réincarnation"" (a french book) has the intellectual ability to analyze what the reincarantion can be making B. Weiss appear naive and his book weak. Very very weak!Unfortunaltely, the book hasn't been translated into english so no comparaison can be made with stories people need to colour thier life ( Weiss writes dreams for people) and what I consider a real work of research about reincarnation."
1,"Interesting read, but wrong path","Dr. Weiss should be credited for bringing so many people to become more aware of the journey of the soul, the law of karma, and the common thread of all religions.It would be useful to experience and understand all of this by becoming more awakened in our consciousness.However, hypnosis is the opposite of awakening.Under hypnosis, one goes through a vivid feeling as if experiencing a past life or even many lives, however, at a tremendous expense.Hypnosis depletes the body of a large amount of conscious energy, and the whole system becomes even more asleep!!"
4,"Many Masters, Many Lives","One of the best books I have read that adds a new dimension to the issue is there an afterlife. An amazing account of conversations between psychiatrist and young patient who descibes past lives with such detail that is hard to believe, but shows there may be multiple lives for all of us... a very hopefull idea that we should explore more fully."
5,A must read! Addictive and thought-provoking.,"This book absolutely has the power to change your ideas about life and death. A well-written story, it sucks you in and leaves you seeing life through a filter of what-ifs. I recommend it to anyone who has ever searched herself for the answers to life's rhetorical questions."
2,I believe in reincarnation but books deals with too many lives of a person,"I totally believe in reincarnation, guardian angels and masters but towards the end, the book was just too boring to read. The book talks about too many lives of a lady (more than 12 maybe). A few lives would have been interesting but who's interested in MANY boring past life stories of Catherine anyways....You can read it once maybe but obviously not worth reading again and again....."
5,Excellent,"I read this book a couple of months ago, and am still recommending it like crazy to all and sundry.This book only states what has been known by ancient Hindu sages and seers in India.May we all learn from this and be noble, humble and ""dharmic"" in our lives."
1,Should have been published in a tabloid,"For a man who claims he ""distrusted anything that could not be proved by scientific methods"", his book noticeably lacks hard evidence. His narration of Catherine's past lives quickly becomes repititous and downright boring. Despite being an extremely quick read, this book was a waste of time."
3,More like a entry level book for the newbie!,"Before I read this book, I had read Dr Michael Newton's ""Journey of Souls"" and ""Destiny of Souls"" at least two times each. Then I ordered this book to see the different view on the subject. I found some similarity but little too amateurish as the book is basically author's first quest on this field. The book is focused on a single individual's different past lives and that definitely narrows the scope of the knowledge. Also, I found that the masters that author mentions in this book were judgmental and little harsh to be a ""real"" ascended beings. To me they sound more like beings from astral plane/lower dimensions...I would suggest people interested in this field to read ""Journey of souls' first and ""destiny of souls"" by Dr Michael Newton, which are very well written and based on many subjects' account over the long time. When I read these books fist, I definitely felt "" finally I found the answer""."
5,Convincing,"I bought this book a couple of years ago and got this one now as a present for my friend. Dr. Weiss book gives you goosebumps just reading it. A great book for people who weren't convinced reincarnation exists, but who will be after reading the book..."
5,Different View,My best friends sister was only twenty when she past away. I gave her this book not to change her belief in dealth but to see it in a different way. She has never stopped thanking me for helping her see not only that difficult situation more clear but she has also passed it on to some friends that have also been thankful. Everyone should read this book.
3,"Well written, but a bit formulaic","The book is an easy read, but the level of verification of is heard is implied. For example, there is some level of verification against external facts (i.e. certain events are consistent with time periods) and internal consistencies (same facts are relayed across multiple sessions), but I have a feeling of being ""led"" into believing wholeheartedly what is reported. Is this ""fiction"" or ""non-fiction"" makes the book interesting.If you are even somewhat familiar with the tenets of the Buddhist religion, then the observations relayed in the book will be familiar."
4,A Very Interesting Read,"I just finished this book for the second time. Now, I'm not sure if I'm a believer in past lives or not, but I welcome different beliefs and ideas. This is different."
5,Moving....,"Amazing, moving book. As someone that believes in reincarnation, this book gave insight into the physical and spiritual worlds here and beyond."
5,Great step toward reincarnation proof!,"I am a Spiritist and I already believed in reincarnation, but it is very satisfying to see people who dont believe in such thing being transformed and advocating for the cause. Beautifully written."
3,Many Minds Many Masters,"A psychiatrist's experience in interviewing numerous patients under hypnosis describing former lives and experiences. In many repsects this book is ""out of this world"" as some sort of science fantansy but the possibility of it being valid keeps one's interest at a very high level. Far out but very thought provoking."
4,Unnerving,"This book was reccommended to me after talking of my experiences I've had with my 3 year old neice with a co-worker. My neice would share long past memories in detail of things that I had done as a child with my grandmother. She would say ""Remember when I was your Nana and your were my little, little girl and we did this..."". She's even told me that she'll be my ""nana"" again and I'll be her ""little, little girl"". It frightened me - especially as a skeptic. This book opened many doors for me and has in a way comforted my doubts in regard to religion."
5,Life Changing,"This book is a life changer. It confirmed an untaught knowledge that I've had since a very young girl. The messages from the Masters made my hair stand on end. I know that I will read all of Mr. Weiss' books, they will be a key to my studies in this life and the next. I am truly humbled and thankful."
2,Disempowering Psychiatric Witch Craft,"I am a Ph.D. Psychologist. I have been a professional hypnotherapist & past-life regressionist for over thirty years and have worked with many thousands of clients. Although this book is interesting, the author's approach to his client as described in this book is amateurish at best. His approach is that of a typical MD psychiatrist. By not letting his client remember her sessions and by not teaching her how to access the wisdom of her unconscious mind on her own, he did her a great dis-service. After a full year of therapy basically all she became was a more well-adjusted zombie rather than a truly empowered being. Certainly the practice of past-life regression is quite interesting but Brian Weiss's techniques and insights are Kindergarten."
3,One nagging question,"Although I'm not new to the examination of reincarnation, I haven't taken a look at the literature in years, and I found this an interesting read. I hit a stumbling block early in this book, however. Catherine quickly identifies a couple of the first lifetimes she enters as BC-- one was 1651, I believe. People who lived BC didn't know, of course, that they were living BC. This method of dividing time was devised about 500 years after Christ was here. At first I'm thinking, maybe this is her higher self or something, figuring this out somehow. But in other lifetimes, the psychiatrist asks her for a year and she is looking around trying to find a clue--once he suggested she look for a newspaper. What possible clue could she have seen for BC dates?Big question, because unless there is a plausible explanation for this, it casts doubt on everything that he writes--and there's not much point in critiquing anything else. I'm just going for the middle to be fair."
5,The beginning of a Spiritual Journey,"For many people, this book is the beginning of their spiritual journey. We reincarnate here on Earth with a veil that doesn't let us remember what is on the other side. Dr. Weiss offers us in his first book a door to that other side, a door that he opened for his first time in this lifetime."
5,"Many lives, many masters","""Many Lives,Many Masters"" has explained many experiences and stories that I could not understand before. The reincarnation and the wisdom passed on by the masters are very similar to the belief of Buddhism. I am not a religious person but born in a Buddhist family. I refuse to read religious books because I simply felt that they are written to sell their religious believes. This book certainly will help me understand the purpose of life & religions better.It is highly recommended for all. The interesting experiences of Catherine and the messages from the Masters will makes you think and help answering many soul searching questions."
5,Absolutely Awesome!,This was my introduction to Brian Weiss and it has been a wonderful reading experience! This has only made me want to hear more from this Psychologist...and to learn more about past-life regression!
3,I would like to believe,"The topic of this book wasn't unfamiliar to me. Many years ago I read a book by Shirley Macclein treating this same topic. Of course Many Lives, Many Masters was written by a psychiatrist wich adds scientific accuracy to the reincarnation theory. Unfortunately I don't believe in this theory but the book made me think better about this. So this is a point in favour of the book."
4,Pretty Good Book,"I liked the book.I found the writing style to be accessible, so book got finished faster. The concepts are good, I found them to coincide with Hindu teachings of reincarnations and many Gods and many universes etc.I would definitely recommend this book."
4,Changing lives through regression,It was an easy and interesting read. I learned a fair about about past life regression. Thumbs up.
4,Excellent introduction to reincarnation,"Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weiss is an excellent introduction to the area of reincarnation. It shows the conversion of a scientific based psychiatrist to belief in reincarnation, a faith based concept.Dr. Weiss provides us with his credentials, then proceeds to lead us through the unfolding of many of the past lives of one of his patients This journey starts as an attempt to provide therapeutic relief for a patient. It concludes with Dr. Weiss accepting that many of our problems today are the result of things that have occurred in previous lifetimes."
3,Past Lives in WWII,I was driven to this book as a result of reading a WWII novel called The Commodore. The Commodore could have happened and may have and deals with two past lives from WWII. The novel captured me to such a degree that I read this book and found it more than interesting.The Commodore
5,"Why we should make love, not war.","It's unusual to read a book like this written by an accomplished psychiatrist/professional. But I personally had conversations with a psychiatrist friend who was talking generically about his patients in a mental hospital. It was striking to me then that he wouldn't allow his psychic patients to touch him in any way because they frequently were known to 'see' negative aspects of one's future.Good story, fun reading and with a most important message.Rah-Rah. Great message and the right one to live by.Make love, not war."
2,Many Masters Many LIves,"This book is easy to read. However, I would like to believe what is written. I need more proof. For example, when Catherine talks about her past lives, why couldn't the author validate her past lives? She provided vague details during her hypnosis (I have brown pig tails, my hair is blonde...I see a building with marble floors, soldiers with black and gold uniforms with tassels...etc). Could the authour have researched through census or other means to validate if in fact, these past lives did exist?"
2,"Interesting, but Mr. Weiss do not give a chance to check it","It's so easy to write about somethig that nobody can prove. And it's worse if the person who wrote do not give us a condition to check if the experience and the changes on her patient really happened.Of course what Mr. Weiss tell us is very interisting and the message is too much confortable and beatiful. But wy so many misteryous? Why the doctor doesn't submit his experience on test by another specialists from many areas. Why he keep the analisys of this fenomenum only with him, his whife and his patient almost for a year?Mr. Weiss is a scientist, so more than just tell everybody his experiences, he must to permit the science check it or confirm its benefit unless."
3,"Fact or Fantasy, difficult to tell ..","I have just one question to the experienced readers on the subject. If you are living in the past, how on earth would you know that the year is 1800 BC? I believe the term BC itself was coined much later. I found the book to be a bit cheesy and not quite technical/intense as I had expected, esp. coming from a qualified psychiatrist. Blurting out your fantasy of being an Egyptian princess in a hypnotic state is one thing, recollecting your true past is another. The tough part is determining which of those is true."
1,I beg you to save your money. This deserves zero stars.,"Ridiculous. Unsubstantiated. Her comment on p. 27 about what year it is = 1863 B.C., was the beginning of the end for me. Absolute tripe.Incidentally, I believe that we have eternal souls. This book was terrible. I question the sanity of the author."
1,Present-Life Therapy,"Please people, get a life, and make it a REAL one. Read The Power of Now if you want open-hearted, practical wisdom. Read the Skeptical Inquirer, in which people with rational minds refute all the ""evidence"" for past lives, reincarnation, recovered memories and the like. Hypnosis opens up our ability to fantasize, to create myths out of our lives. But myths aren't facts, just as dreams aren't facts. When we believe them to be real, we walk down a very long path that leads us away from the truths of our actual physical-mental-emotional lives and towards illusions and false memories and often our Shadow selves. Be open-hearted, be open-minded, but please be rational and read books like this for the fantasy [and poor psychotherapy] that they recount."
2,Disappointed!,"Maybe I read this book a decade too late! I dig most New Age books and spiritual books. I think I had too many expectations from this book. The book is all about the past lives of one person and does not convey the expected dose of meaning for others (who read it).A good effort but not SO good a book, doctor. Sorry!"
5,Very enlightening book even for the true non-believer of reincarnation,A distant acquaintance told me about this book and its ability to convert even the faintest of reincarnation believers... She was right! Its easy reading that presents the content in an objective perspective - you don't feel like you should be wearing a tin foil hat while reading far fetched sci-fi tales. I definitely recommend this book. I think it has permanently altered my opinion about life and death.
5,Phenomenal,This is one of the most wonderful books that I've ever read. It inspired to me pursue past life therapy for myself to heal my chronic depression and improve my low self-worth. It made such a difference in my lfe that I became a certified hpnotherapist and I now do past life therapy with people so I can help heal others like I have been healed. This new therapy will definately change the world and the way people look at life. I've never known what true happiness is until now and I can thank Dr.Weiss for the wonderful change it made in my life and what an inspiration the book has been for me.
3,Many Lives? or Many Lies?,"through the book, the author keeps telling you how skeptic and scientific he is, and yet, this book seems to be the work of someone with an English literature rather than with a science background. How do the people from the 18th century knows that they are from the 18th century? how can the woman tell that someone were her friends in the present life, they look identical or what? The authors doesn't even ask questions like this , he simply keeps writing this book of fantasy. it's not a bad book, if the approach is has been more scientific."
3,It's OK,Don't go to his web site (brianweiss.com). You won' t want to finish what for me was a very nice book. It looks like the site of a cheesy astrologer . Diminished much credibility for me.
4,Any Answers?,"I would like to think that all of this is possible. Who the heck knows? I found the book interesting, thought provoking, and it made me think about reincarnation and my life's journey. I would like to know where I have been, where I'm going. Am I making a difference?Could this be the answer to deja vu? What the heck happens when you experience that ""I've never been here before, but I sure feel like I know about this place"" feeling that we all have had at one time or another?Who's to say that it's not what Dr. Weiss attributes it to? Who are we anyway? What are our purposes in this life? These are the ultimate questions - does this book have the ultimate answers? Read it for yourself and see what you think when you finish.I enjoyed the book and the possible explanations to questions I have in my own life. You may find it thought provoking too."
4,A breakthrough for relationships,"After reading this book, I finally got a good grasp on the why and how of relating to others. Brian Weiss's account of reincarnation is extremely inspiring, revealing and honest. The good thing is, he doesn't care whether you believe the events he describes or not. There's nothing to verify anyway, but I just knew deep inside that it was all true. My life is changed forever, for the better!"
3,"Good Topic, New to Author","I was first introduced to this topic via JOURNEY OF SOULS (Michael Newton, PhD). If you are interested in this book, you MUST read JOURNEY OF SOULS!! A friend that I recommended JOURNEY to, gave me this book. I learned a lot about the Christian background in regards to reicarnation thanks to Dr Weiss. His writing style did become annoying at times. But I am very grateful to him for putting forth this work. Currently, I am reading MESSAGES FROM THE MASTERS (Weiss, MD) - which is wonderful."
5,So interesting...,This book opened my eyes to another realm. It is amazing that one could have multiple lives and they are connected to each other like a puzzle. I would encourage you to read with an open mind if you are interested in this type of subject.
4,INTERESTING,"I totally enjoyed this book. It opened my eyes and gave me a lot to think about and the incentive to read more on this subject, especially by this author."
2,Hoped for More,"This book has come up in conversation or just popped out at me on a shelf multiple times. Finally taking the hint, I read this short volume over a few short days. Despite its fascinating premise, I didn't enjoy it very much. It seemed redundant and a little boring. I'm fascinated by the concept and I'm certainly a believer in the theory of past lives but I couldn't get into this book. There wasn't anything in it that created an attachment to either the author or his patient. It's a little like reading chart notes."
3,good,"I have read this book with the grate interest. It was my first book of Mr. Weiss. The theme is rather fantastic and if it is true, we have many possibilities to discuss the consequences of it."
5,Terrific!,"I loved the book, it was well written, intriguing and thought provoking. It conveyed what I always new to be true, love is all that really matters. The author had incredible courage to write on a subject that so many of us are afraid to face-the truth."
3,hmm.,"A truly fascinating read but where are the hard facts he keeps talking about? I don't disbelieve in reincarnation, but I wonder why the actual transcripts aren't in this book. Or verifications of dates, historical occurances, etc. that Catherine mentioned while in her trances. I want to see the scientific method at work here, doctor! It's absence is suspicious."
5,Great book!,I really liked this book. It changed my way of thinking about life. Now I would like to continue reading the next one he wrote after this one. I have a feeling it would we as good as this one.
5,MMM INTERESTING.,"this book is very interesting, I'm hoping that a lot of people read it and change.I recommended to all my friends."
5,The Gift that keeps on giving,This book will open up your world and literally bring Magic into your Life. For anyone that I know that has lost a loved one I've recommended this book and to no avail have I received rave reviews post read. I am extremely thankful to Brian L. Weiss for sharing the Wisdom and for all the lives I know he has helped when reading this book. :)
5,Excellent interpretation of a difficult subject.,"Dr. Weiss is a professional scientific writer who after coming accross a subject matter that he has not encountered in the past gives an articulate and accurate presentation of the experience.It follows very closely to other books on this subject but is much better written and with less editorializing. If you allow your perspective to be expanded, it nicely ties together a number of religious dogma which we encounter in our every day lives. You will enjoy it."
5,Something that finally makes sense,"Dr. Weiss' book is one of the most affirming books that I have ever read. It reveals to us what religions have decided to eliminate....we are all immortal souls! This does not relieve us of responsibility but affirms the need to be a student throughout our lives. This book reveals the ultimate truth that we are everyman and he is us. As the world grows smaller it is necessary for all of us to be compassionate towards every human being and to become caretakers of the earth that we all share. It is our University of Our Soul. We need each other and provide experiences for our souls to progress towards its eventual reunion with the universal SOUL. Dr. Weiss has been selected to help give us this message. How appropriate in this age of Science that the message comes to us from a physician, not a cleric or theologian."
5,a credible story about the incredible,"I try to read at least two or three books a month. But at the pace I read this book, I could go up to 8 or 10. I read Many Lives, Many Masters in less than 3 days, which for me is very quick. I read Talking to Heaven before I read this one so I was predisposed to many of the underlying themes mentioned in Weiss' book. Credibility was not a barrier, I have an open mind but not a gulliable one. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to challenge their everyday beliefs about life because this book will certainly do that."
2,"Who knew what ""BC"" meant in 1875 BC?","I read Many Lives Many Masters because of a comment made by John Steinbeck in his ""Travels with Charlie"" 35 years ago. He said something to the effect that if God would renew every leaf and blade of grass every year, why would he waste a human soul. I felt I was really going to enjoy Many Lives Many Masters and looked for validation of Steinbeck's remark. Then the author/psychiatrist takes the woman back in time and asks what year it is, and her response is ""1875 BC."" I would have believed perhaps ""3334 year of the dog"" or something like that. I can only assume that in the abridgement of the book for the tape, a definition of the time was simply converted to ""1875 BC."" The author lost all credibility for me with that one remark. I finished the tape but couldn't get past that. Plus I think if the author isn't an actor himself, he should hire one for the reading. It was very flat."
5,AMAZING,"This hands down is one, if not the best book I have read. I am actually reading it again because it was so great. This helped me understand more and more of what I knew and gave me clarity.Great book"
4,Honest beauty,"The beauty of this book goes beyond the subject matter. The beauty of this book is not the list of achievements in the world of science and medicine of the author, letting you know exactly what background he comes from. The beauty of this book is not its lucidity, or its conciseness, or its poetic completeness in less than two hundred pages.The beauty of this book is the heartfelt honesty of the writer you will feel on each and every page. Whatever your take on the subject matter, this man easily transcends the work of Shirley McClaine and much of his own antecedents who have studied the subject in depth and scientifically by giving you his heart and soul in its context, such that is all but impossible to doubt that this is the actual experience he has had--just as he describes it. Read it as a novel if you have to, but read it because it is true to him, and it will be true to you, changing you almost equally.This book touched me deeply."
3,Some thoughts,"I gave it 3 stars because its a compelling read, although I am highly skeptical of the Dr.'s conclusions.1) Catherine had a previous life in 1800 BC. World population in that time was 40 million. World population at the time of her treatments was 4.4 billion. If every soul in existence in 1800 BC continued to live on till till the writing of the book, those souls would comprise less than 1% of the world population. Dr. Weiss stresses that Catherines past lives were not remarkable (she was a servant not a queen etc.). But the fact she is such an 'old soul' is statistically highly improbable.2) People in 1800 BC didnt refer to themselves as living in BC, as they had no ability to foretell the AD times3) Dr. Weiss hits pretty hard wis his own special abilities as a highly intelligent man in this past and throughout history. Is this book really just a self love screed?"
1,Bunk,"This book is of the worst kind. It's author's credentials would lead one to believe that this is a scientific study. It is the most subjective, self absorbed accumulation of drivel that I've ever seen. I would have no objection to this, had it not been promoted as science. There are NO substantial or verifiable facts in the entire book. Please don't waste your time or money."
1,A Good Story,"My wife suggested I read this book because she found it fascinating to say the least, and besides I enjoy reading about this sort of phenomenon.Well I got to page 27 where the doctor says he is able to take down word for word what the regressed patient is saying because ""While hypnotized, Catherine spoke in a slow and deliberate whisper.""Catherine then goes on to describe a past life where she says, ""The year is 1863 B.C.""For those of you who don't get it, if you were back in 1863 B.C. you wouldn't know it was 1863 years before a future event i.e. the birth of Christ.From that point I knew I wasn't reading an amazing account of someone's fantastic experience, but simply a good story."
5,"Absolute BEST book I have ever read, period.","Fantastic book! I have given away 10+ copies of this book and each person has been blow away by the content. We would all be better people if we take this information to heart and lead a clean, honest life."
4,For those new to reincarnation,"Brian Weiss MD makes it very clear at the beginning of the book of his strictly scientific background and his need of scientific proof before accepting new concepts in the medical field. So it was undoubtedly a surprise for him in the course of hypnotherapy on one client to find the client regressing to previous lives, and further to hear voices of ""masters"" from the spiritual realm giving information on the lessons of one's lives on earth. This kind of experience must have been fascinating and his account of it is wonderful - as is the amazing progress his client makes through a number of regression sessions. Since I am already a believer in reincarnation I did not get as much out of this book as ""Only Love is Real"". However, for people who are new to the concept of reincarnation or are a little doubtful of it, this book offers a lot."
5,"Finding the ""Meaning of Life""","This book turned my life around 99%. I've lived in fear all my life. The biggest question, since I was a child, had always been ""why am I here?"". Not having this question answered has kept me from having any peace in my life. Now I know the ""meaning of life"" and knowing ""God Loves Me"" how can fear be a part of my life now? Upon reading this book many times and going to seminars to hear Dr. Weiss I am at peace with myself and have ""found my soul"". I shine from within and all who are in my space feel the warmth coming from me. Thank you God for bringing Dr.Weiss into my life. I am truly happy with this gift of life. How I live it will be ""my"" gift to Him."
5,AN AMAZING BOOK!,I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE THE MOST INTERESTING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. IT HAS BROUGHT PEACE AND UNDERSTANDING TO MY LIFE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
5,A Must Read,"This book is not some metaphysical hokey pokey stuff. This is based on a true story. I have read this book at least a dozen times and it is a fasinating read. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommended. Truly a must read. Dare to make known the unknown."
1,disappointed,"I have to say, this book seems very creepy.....as a christian I feel like this is satan rearing his ugly head. Not very well written and disturbing to read."
1,Stretches credulity to the breaking point,"This was a book group book - not my choice or my cup of tea. If you can suspend disbelief, or believe in reincarnation already, or have lost a loved one and long to believe that their spirit lives on, this book is for you. If you are a scientist past or present, an atheist, or a skeptic, you will find this unbelievably frustrating, as I did. Many in my book group loved it and took great comfort in it."
5,Changed my life.,"This book really impacted me. It certainly helped me improve my way of thinking and approaching certain situations especially those related to human interactions, death and the daily events we encounter."
1,forgotten already!,"I was given this book to read by a therapist a few years ago. She implied that it would really leave a lasting impression and be very helpful for my depression and anxiety. You know, it was readable and interesting I guess, but I don't recall any lessons learned or even what the book was about really. I do remember it wasn't particularly helpful or even believable. Give me a break! This book should not be in the self-help section, but the sci-fi section!"
1,Text to audio not enabled,I had been waiting for this book to come out in Kindle format...But will not buy it due to the fact that the Text to audio is disabled.
4,Breathtaking,"This book was referred to me by my friend. I am a person, who believes in past life, reincarnation and all that stuff, but this book was even too much for me. Its very good book and made me want to go though this hypnoses even more."
3,too repetitive,"I became bored after reading midway through the book. A question arised as to the validity of some of the statements of one of the patients. Such as ""winning all the races in one day."" Any proof here? Also, most of the regressed patients could have saved in their minds material usurped from television and other readings. I recognized many of the prior regressed years, clothing, community, area of the country, and geographies just from what I already know. Nothing new here. I found the material boring. Nothing really special in any of their regressions.Also, I paid for a new book and received a damaged front cover.Beverly Covington"
4,Is quite interesting....,"Actually, I haven't read the book yet.... but my mum did...... and she loves it. I don't fully believe what the book said, but i think it's interesting..... i'm sure that i'll buy the book and read it carefully.... The most interesting thing in the book is it explains you why sometimes you see some unknown places and people familiar..... (this very often happen to me)...."
1,Is the doctor true scientist?,"This book totally lacks of basic scientific methods. On top of it, It lacks of basic logic.It's sad to see a scientist go so far from science!However this is a chicken soup for people seeking comfort in eternal life when they face real life problems.If you seriously interested in reincarnation, I highly recommend Dr. Ian stevenson 's research. It contains much more convincing data for a rational mind."
1,Trite prose on a topic of such potential,"I first heard about this book while I was in college. My roommate came back from a Christmas vacation touting its originality. It took me over 10 years to finally get around to reading it, and what a waste of time. Given such a fascinating topic, the whole book focuses on irreverent tidbits of sage advice from ""Masters"" that are never identified, clarified, or placed into the whole context of reincarnation. For a patient that supposedly went through so many lives and interfaced with so many ""masters,"" she sure was devastated and plagued by more psychosis than the average schizophrenic. The prose was awkward and choppy, and the whole thing read like a transcipt of a really shoddy B-movie."
5,an amazing journey,"I should have ticked many more stars if was available. This is a book in which even one sentence has not been written for marketing and a higher sale. I highly recommend this book to whom like to step on spirituality. Regression can change every aspect of our life fundamentally. Therefore, for those who even prefer not to open their minds and have a critic perspective towards new thoughts, I absolutely invite them for this new challenge because if something is from the heart, adsorb itto the heart, as well."
5,Compelling...,"It's weird that when I first opened the package, I was ready to send this book back unread. But soon after I started reading it, I was hooked.Many Lives, Many Masters puts a spin on private thoughts,deja vu, anxieties, feelings or sensations that seem unexplained. We've all had them, but kind of brush them off as insignificant.This book gives credence to the naysayers who deny that this dimension of the human element exists. I have passed this book to a neighbor who called me and said he has bought books for his family.There is no denial that we need to keep an open mind as we explore this dimension in life, although seemingly intangible, that it may connect us to previous lives and experiences."
4,Past Lives - Real?,"The book does a good job of documenting past life recall done under hypnosis and will challenge your beliefs if you are still in doubt as to the validity of reincarnation. Based on my own experience, every person has a past life recall under hypnosis, sometimes many (as the case in this book). Interestingly, many of the ""memories"" are intimately related to challenges the person has in this life thereby making past-life regression a valid theraputic technique. In short, I recommend this book; it's an easy read and very interesting.- Author ofHow I Got Lucky and Bumped into God: A Novel of Meeting the Divine"
2,Written more for adults than children,"I was looking for a book that would help a child if he or she was lost in the woods - how to make a shelter, a fire, etc. This was written for an adult to use with a child. I wanted something written for a child who was about eleven or twelve."
5,Great toy and excellent value!,"We purchased this set for our son's third birthday. I spent countless hours comparing train tables/train sets online and determined that this is the best set you can buy for the money. Our son already had many of the Thomas The Tank Engine wooden trains that were compatible with this set. This was by far the best gift we have given him, he absolutely loves it! We additionally purchased the roundhouse made by Imaginarium to go along with the set. The roundhouse was only $20 in comparison to the Thomas The Train one that was $60 (on sale) I would recommend this set to any train enthusiast."
2,Expected better,I bought this set for my son for his 3rd birthday. He loves it but I am disappointed. He received this yesterday and already my husband has had to glue track and the helicopter back together. My son is not overly rough with his toys either.I think alot of the extra peices (trees and stuff) just get in the way for the little kids because they are always knocking them over while trying to push the train along. The train tracks seem to fit loosely together and be cut in different thickness creating a bumpy ride for the trains. Often leading to a disappointing derailment.The train table was put together with minimal assistance but the little peices that go on the table (included in the 100pc set) were quite difficult to screw together. The screws were tiny and the pre-drilled holes didn't always go straight.The drawers are big enough and open and close with ease.I wouldn't recommend this only because of the tracks and accessories that are included are very poorly built.
5,son can't get enough of it,"We got this for our son who turned 2 in December. There hasn't been a day that has gone by that he hasn't played with it. All of his Thomas trains fit great with it. He really loves it. I have never seen him play with one toy so much. I would highly recommend this item. It is also a lot cheaper the the actualThomas table and it comes with tracks, and trains too."
2,Missing Parts,"The table is missing two legs(#7). The box that was purchased and all it's contents was new and never opened. Trying to contact kidcraft is a nightmare, always busy. Waiting on the needed parts to finish building the set."
2,Magnets Detaching From Trains,Be very careful about magnets detaching from the trains! We recently purchased the Deluxe Wooden Train Table w/100 piece train set by Imaginarium from Toys R Us for our son for Christmas and already 4 of the small magnets have come off - we only have 10 trains out of the box right for our son to play with and already 4 of the trains have detached magnets - this is a dangerous choking hazzard! We are currently contacting Toys R Us for product recall information. We would otherwise give this product a better review.
4,My 3 year old loves it!,We bought this trian set for my 3 year old for christams. I can't believe how well made it is and how many pieces it has for the amount of money we spent. I was thrilled that it worked well with his thomas stuff too. The cons are the helicopter falls apart I crazy glued it once and it fell apart again already. Also one of the magnet pieces came off of a train and I was afraid of it becoming a choking hazard for my infant. Nothing a little glue can't fix though. Overall it is a great value that I know will get many years of play. I am so happy we purchased this set.
5,CHEEPER @ THE TOYS R US STORE,UNTILL WED 11/23 THIS IS ON SALE FOR $94 PLUS YOU GET A $10 GIFT CARD FOR TOYS R US.
1,Worst Train table ever!!!,My husband and I have been trying to put this together for our son for the last 2 hours on CHRISTMAS EVE NO LESS. The drawers won't screw together -ill fitting/stripped out screw openings. ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS that this is how we spend our Christmas eve and now it seems that our 22 month old son won't even get to open this gift in the morning - which by the way was his biggest gift from SANTA. I am so completely upset and disturbed that we would spend this kind of money and now not even have train table for our son to enjoy on Christmas day...COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY ($129) YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. DON'T GO CHEAP!!!
5,INCREDIBLE BUY!,"First of all, a table alone normally cost the amount of this set. My 2 year old grand daughter LOVES this table. we put it in front of our large screen tv to keep prying hands off... so it is a toy and a screen saver!I highly suggest ANYONE interested in getting a train for their kids or grandkids to purchase this wonderful toy. ALL the wooden train sets like Thomas will work on the track as well. great wooden quality that beats ANY BRAND of plastic trains or wooden trains out there!!!"
4,Great Table - accessories not,We purchased this table complete with the train set up for our two boys for christmas. They love it. To put the table to gether was easy and it is light weight enough to move about. Total table put together time about 1 hour. The accessories on the otherhand are not what I would call quality. We have repaired 5 items thus far (since dec 25th and today is Jan 2nd) The wheels keep comming off possing a choking hazzard. The track itself is fine and the trains from other wooden sets work well on this track. If you want a quality table then this is it. Be forwarned you will have to repair or remove the peices that keep falling apart.
2,This Stinks,We bought this table for my 3 1/2 son for Christmas. I am disappointed in the quality of this train set. The wooden pieces have broken as well as the airplane wings have fallen off. We bought this thinking it was a nice set because it was compatible with the Thomas line and Brio. My son also got a Geotrax train system which is a much better product for his age. My younger son and him have put it through its paces and not a single piece has broken. I don't recommend the wooden train set for the 4- whatever age group. I am going to put it away until he is a little older and is not going to break it so easily.
2,Wheels Fall Off- Use caution!!,"We purchased this train table about 6 months ago and it seemed like a great deal. Now I know why- you get what you pay for. The coating on the top of the table has come unpeeled for no reason AND the wheels and magnets on three of the trains have spontaneously fallen off. We have reported it to the consumer product safety commission. My son loves to play with it, but I would next time purchase a more expensive similar product that won't become a choking hazard."
2,Waste of Money,We bought my son whos three this train table for Christmas because he always loved playing with it at the store.. But He absolutely hates it now..The train always falls off the track when you push it down the hill he gets so frustrated that he takes the whole train track apart...I do not recommend buying this toy... It just takes up space in our basement
1,Where's the,"After reading very favorable reviews in September, I decided to purchase the table for my (...)son. Originally it was going to be for his birthday in September, but with all the gifts he got from others, I decided to wait until Christmas. My husband was able to put the table together very easily on Christmas Day. When I went to move the table today, I saw that it was made mostly of MDF. The only ""real wood"" pieces were the corner pieces that hold the drawers together. After looking over the box, it does not indicate what is actually ""real wood"". Unfortunately, I trusted the reviews of several people who praised the ""real wood"" aspect. I should have stuck with my gut and ordered the one from Back to Basics Toys."
2,Poor quality,I purchased this for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. The construction was fairly easy but the actual tracks don't fit together properly. The cars come apart and the buildings do not stay together. All the surrounding pieces knock over when you move the cars along the track. Poor product.
5,"At last, a marketing book that tells the truth.","This book is greatly needed. It's the first book that tells itlike it is. It lights a path to a first sale, by an author whohas walked the walk. This author knows what she's talking about.There is another way to market a screenplay...and it doesn'trequire that you have the almost impossible to find, agent. Youcan do it yourself. This books shows you how to find a marketfor your first script. Then the author wants to hear from you...to see how you're doing. She's given her contact information...she really cares."
4,An excellent reference but NOT for beginners!,"This book is great an an idea-starter, and as a reference for what is possible in paper making. It is NOT a good beginning text, and does not contain adequate instructions for a beginner to make that first sheet of paper. It also does not contain a source reference for suppliers, etc."
2,Product was not in condition stated,"When I bought this book second hand it said ""good condition."" Upon receiving it, I learned it was an old library book and it was covered in stains and water damage. I know that making paper is a messy process, but I would expect a book in ""good"" condition to actually be what it states."
5,Beautiful!,This wonderfully illustrated book examines the history of papermaking and also outlines step-by-step instructions for creating distinct handmade paper.A wonderful resource book for any paper enthusiast!
4,"Artisticamente bien presentado, una gran ayuda.","He tenido la oportunidad de revisar esta publicación, soy ingeniero especialista en celulosa y papel, consultor para proyectos de esta indole a nivel latinoamérica, sugiero que en una proxima publicación se expliquen los fundamentos fisicos, quimicos , de manera que el lector pueda establecer los parámetros de control a cada uno de los proyectos."
2,modeling Spaniards,"If you want to see how a beefcake calendar is made, then here you go. If you like Spanish pretty boys, then you should peep this. There is dorsal nudity, but I didn't see any frontal nudity. Sometimes it is hard to watch the scenes and read the subtitles simultaneously, and sometimes the subtitles had spelling errors in them. The models are relaxed and unpretentious. Sometimes the photographer's dialogue is overdone though. For example, he says something like, ""I felt so protected when I was around Diego and his rowing mates."" Really, he should have said, ""Hey! I get turned on being around hot guys!"" This work got repetitive quickly. Still, it may be nice to have playing in the background during a party. It promotes that Beauty Myth look: thin, hairless, and young. The photographer was a bearish type and I would have much rather seen him shirtless and posing than these Ken dolls. Though the photographer is Basque, all of the dialogue is in standard Spanish."
4,"For a fan of the Spanish essence and form, a must-have","Yes, the incessant monotone speech of the photographer (though he's quite talented) would be best left as an option, not a requirement, but as for a moving visual of photography sessions of real, gorgeous Spanish men, I, for one, can't complain. Very real; these guys are not preeners. It's a keeper."
1,It's a bad CD!,"It's a bad CD! It isn't Alfred Newman!...The choir is the worst choir I ever hear! The singers have horrible voices....If you want hear the true Newman , buy the available originals in SAE, Rhino and Tsunamy labels"
1,Aptly titled,"No part of nothin' is exactly what this album is. I'm sure these boys are a lot of fun to jam with or maybe even see in person, but the repetetive nature of the banjo player (learn a new lick, will ya?) coupled with some of the weakest mandolin playing I've heard in YEARS leaves me underwhelmed to say the least.I will say this; their writing is good. Above average actually. Why they decided to record it themselves rather than trying to find interested bands remains a mystery though."
4,gold magic brass pressing comb,"I purchased this item some years back and it is verygood and in may 2008, I purchased one for mymother-in-law, she loves it. I would definitelyrecommend it."
4,Read the Original Diary,"Back in the early 1960's a friend and I were babysitting in Lily Dale, NY (Chautauqua County). The lady we were babysitting for had found an old Civil War diary in the basement. Bob and I read it that night. Imagine my surprise many years later when I was at Gettysburg and saw the book Diary of a Dead Man, read a few pages and realized it was the diary I had read in its original form. I'm interested in how and when it left Lily Dale, and how it came to be published. I cannot remember the name of the woman we were babysitting for. Anyway, I enjoyed the diary very much and appreciate it that I got to read it in the actual handwriting of the soldier."
5,Sam Tops Himself Again,"Just when you thought Christmas was just Christmas, Sam brings a whole new interpretation and meaning to it. His original song, ""On This Night"" is so captivating and mesmerizig and the lyrics are so poetic. The joy of ""The First Noel"" - the warmth of ""Chestnuts"" and the power of ""O Holy Night"" are all perfet. ""All I Need This Christmas"" could become a top 40 radio hit. And ""A World of Difference"" should be a global theme like ""We Are The World Was"". What a gift for the season and the new year. Sam - you have taken us, yet again, to a place beyond this world."
5,"A ""New Classic""","If you're looking for a brand new Christmas CD to lft your spirits this holiday, ""On This Night"" is the one. Sam Harris has written several new songs for this CD that will knock your socks off. ""A World of Difference"" is one that will inspire you to try to make a real impact and help those who are in need at Christmas time and beyond. There are also many ""classics"", such as ""The Christmas Song"" and ""O Holy Night"", that Sam does like no one else. Sam Harris has a voice that will make you believe that angels are still at work all around us. He is truly one of them."
3,Good but not the best,"I would say that this book gives great honor to the men of the SAS and tells their story well. If I has to choose though, I would choose Immediate Action, Bravo Two Zero, (Andy MCNabb SAS), or Inside Delta Force, (Eric Haney). Far better reads with much greater detail in to methods, ops, and lifestyle of these special operators."
2,"Nice, but not well made.","At the onset, you would think I loved this product.. as it is the third one I have purchased. Unfortunately I have not been able to find a satisfactory replacement. The loop on these break so very easily. The loop becomes weak and twists to where there is no control. The oversize grip is nice. Wish they would spend another $.02 and use larger gauge wire.However.. maybe they know what they are doing.. buy it.. when it breaks,, you come back for the replacement.Do as I am doing.. keep looking for that better product."
5,added charges,"I find it unconscionable that a vendor would charge half the sale price additionally as a ""shipping charge"". It does not cost over five dollars to send this item parcel post. I would never again order from this vendor."
3,so-so button hook,"The buttonhook works OK, but is no easier to use than using my somewhat arthritic fingers. Is particularly hard to use to button the top button od a shiry."
5,Helps old fingers,Before the button hook I would spend 5 minutes to button my cuff. Now it takes 2 seconds! I love it.
5,Aaron Neville Ultimate Collection,Excellent cd; we just love his voice and wish we could hear more of him.
2,Mercury Villager & Nissan Quest Auto Repair Manual,"This manual is far from complete! I currently have a 96 Quest and the windshield washer fluid level sensor, failed. The manual contains no information concerning the windshield washer fluid reservoir, pumps, or fluid level sensor. I also used the manual for changing the front disk pads. The manual states ""Remove these two bolts to detach the caliper from the steering knuckle"". Unfortunately, the manual does not state what type of bolts you need to remove. Not until you have the van jacked up and the wheel off do you find out that you are removing a torx (star) bolt. The manual also doesn't give you a size for the torx bolt. I had to call a dealership to get that information and then drive another car to get the part since the van is jacked up and the wheel is off. You'd be better off to spend the extra and get the manufacture's repair manual..."
1,Not a well done book,"The book does not live up to other Haynes manuals. I also own the Quest/Villager Chilton manual and the Shop Manual. When comparing them it is easy to see that both the Hanyes and Chilton manuals were written from the Shop manual and their protocols not really tested. If a procedure is missing from the Shop Manual (replacing the power antenna or location of the plugin for the diagnostic computer) it is also missing from the Haynes book. The Hanyes book is really in need of a revised edition containing ways to trouble shoot very common electrical problems plaguing these cars (rear heater switch, auto locking doors)"
3,Heating Problems,I have a 1995 Villager. Recently I notice that when running the heater and at IDLE I am receiving cold air out as soon as I increase the IDLE I can feel the air starting to warm up then gets hotter. This manual does not give any trouble-shooting guide for this situation. I would like to see this manual updated to include more trouble-shooting guide.
5,A must-have if you own this vehicle -,This is an excellent resource if you own a 1998 Mercury Villager minivan. Great tips and lots of pictures to show you what you need.
2,bruised book,"This was a readable book, but a little more beat up and worn than I thought it would be. Still it came quickly and was a good price."
2,Don't buy if you are looking for a recipe book,Very nice little book to read at the spa... lots of history on the pastery shops but very few RECIPES... it was listed under recipes for macarons.... no such luck! Merdu!
2,Poor choice of recipes,"There is much more to French Patisseries than what I found on this book. The choice of recipes is poor, the lack of photos is a turn-off. Some of the recipes are very elaborate for the average reader and a picture of the finished product could have been an extra help. One thing I dislike about some cookbooks and this is one, is describing mouthwatering dishes or desserts, in this case, and not including the recipe."
3,Paris Sweets,"My mother is extremely into Paris and French things. This item being on her list, I picked it out for her for a Christmas present. Out of the three books I purchased I would have to say this book disappointed me the most (maybe because it was the book I was most looking forward to). It seems like a good enough book, the problem I have with it is that there is no pictures of the item that has been made. That's a big thing for me to have in a cookbook of any sort."
3,Great stories - mediocre recipes,"I, too, love Paris and have spent years there as a student. I was delighted to find anecdotes about all my favorite pastry shops - and some others - and very excited to try the recipes. However, I agree with several other reviewers that not all of the recipes in Greenspan's book are not quite up to par. This comes partly from the fact that there are some desserts that Americans do better - the tea cake, being an excellent example. Greenspan's recipe came out dense and dry and absolutely could not compare to my usual cake. That said, there are several great recipes: the chocolate mousse technique Greenspan offers is very unique, delicious and quick, the madeleines tasty, the tarte tatin good. But I would hesitate to make any of these for a dinner party before trying them myself, seeing the collection is so mixed and many recipes simply not what you'd expect."
5,authentic and amazing,"Dorie Greenspan writes the best recipes. Over the past year, I've tried more than a dozen recipes from this book, and all are authentic and delicious. The recipes for madeleines, Anise Cookies, and the Pierre Herme's Korova cookies are especially noteworthy.Also, recipes in the cookies and simple cakes sections don't take very much time and are suitable for a beginning baker."
4,"Works as described, can't complain","Paid more then I wanted to for it, but I couldn't find them locally. Works great, best weed pulling tool we have in the shed."
