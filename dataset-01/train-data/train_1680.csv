4,A Touching Story,"THE CAREGIVER is a touching story. It is a window into the world of home health through the eyes of a tender, vulnerable woman. It has made me wonder how many caregivers truly have a selfless heart like Jodie. I hope that if/when I am in need of specialized care, that someone such as she would care for me."
4,Hannah Broitman - Avid Knitter,"The baby patterns in this book were good. In fact, the reason for buying the book was because of the baby patterns. However, the patterns for the adults were not exciting."
5,"O.K., so my review didn't make it the first time.","If there is a mother-in-law in your life, or if you're a mother-in-law, get this book. Believe me, you're not going to get any better advice anywhere. Save the money you would spend on the couch -- either drinking beer, or with a therapist -- Camille Russo has the unique convergence of both experience and expertise. You can't find someone more knowledgeable about this subject if you hired a private investigator."
5,PACKED WITH PEARLS OF WISDOM. It WILL make a difference!,"The plain, straight forward guidance and wisdom the authors packed into this book made me take a hard look at our family's relationship. I thought I was perfect. WRONG! I wasn't even close! I may never be perfect, but I am a lot better! I intend to reap the rewards of letting my married children ""grow"" without ""overwatering"". I have already seen some really good changes and I'm starting to re-read some chapters!Read the book. Take some advice. Enjoy the humor. I did. Revel in a better relationship. I am!"
5,a million dollars worth of common sence,"If common sence was money, Camille Russo would be the Bank of New York. This book is not only for mother-in-laws, but for anyone who lives in their solar system. If you have, are about to have, or once had -- and especially if you are a mother-in-law -- buy and read this book, and watch your relationships change for the better."
2,The obvious,"I didn't find that this book had much to say. It just states what everyone already knows. ""How to be the perfect mother in law"", it is just like how to be the perfect anything, everyone knows how because it is just the ""ideal"", something that everyone wants. The author, being a relationship therapist took advantage of her position and made money off of it. She took what people were saying they wanted changed in their relationship and made a book out of it. On a better note, it was entertaining. Like listening to a comedian, something everyone knows but when you hear it you laugh--- only because it is true. If you are looking for a little entertainment read the book, if you want serious help on getting along with in-laws, find a different book."
2,not what I expected.,What I ordered isn't what I received and I bought it as a gift for someone. I'm embarrassed to give it to them for Christmas.
3,"Practical, easy-to-read advice","This book is nothing earth-shattering, but it does offer some helpful tips, especially for someone who has never been in a Mother-in-Law situation before. It is a quick, interesting read. As I said, there is nothing radical and new here, but sometimes it helps to have the obvious pointed out. I gave a copy to my mom."
3,A Classic,"I borrowed this book from the library and found it interesting and surprising. Certainly, this was a groundbreaking theory at the time it was put forward. Although I could see tracks and trails with ""things"" sitting at the end, and odd shapes inside some craters, I could not see much of what the author was describing. This was because the most spectacular photos had been torn from the book!! No doubt the pictures had been removed by 'Men in Black'. To the author's credit, the book is still quoted by contemporary proponents of the theory."
1,Classic crackpot.,"This book is a real classic example of crackpot thinking. Leonard picks NASA photos to show that ""someone else is on the moon"". But the amazing structures he sees in these photos are just at the edge of resolution. Alas, he never mentions that NASA has images (publically available) of the exact same areas but taken much closer to the ground. They show nothing unusual. Leonard's book is a wonderful example of how crackpots and pseudoscientists refuse to examine evidence that shows their crazy theories to be wrong."
4,don't listen to the naysayers,"Just to give this album the respect it deserves, I had to jump in. Although much of the studio wizardry falls flat live (at least it did at the one time I saw them at T.T. the Bears in Cambridge), this album is a great listen from start to finish. Listen to it loud. It's got all the hooks and loops, feedback and fuzz for any of you wall-of-sound rock music fans."
4,Mea wrong-a,"Go figure. I dusted off my copy of this CD last week to listen to during a long road trip and found it a reasonably engaging listen. That means it ages well (for me, at least). I'm posting 4 stars to try to correct my previous 2 star rating up to 3 stars."
1,snoozer,"This band was hyped big time in Minneapolis a few years back - then went on to utter, practically unprecedented failure on the Big Label (interscope). The hype spoke volumes of the supposed genius-wonder of this record, and I foolishly took the bait. It is nothing but a boring, plodding, noisy hunk of self-indulgent junk. Genius this ain't. Good riddance."
2,Steer clear of this one,"Your money is better spent on other discs. This was an engaging listen for me the first one or two times, then began gathering dust in my collection since '95 or '96. The disc features sonically well-crafted synth sounds and MBV-styled guitaristry, but is lacking in songwriting depth and emotional range. I hope the future outings are better. I read that the front man has a huge CD collection; he should consider what music really moves him and produce music of his own that can do the same for others."
4,"the next beatles? or where's my socks, chandlersworth?","I just listening to my new copy of Chandlersworth! what a cd! it was definitely ""worth the chandler,"" if you know what I mean. I mean this music is simply great to listen to. The melodies, lyrics, and themes somehow remind me of a more creative version of england's own ""fab four."" The song ""Christine"" helped ease the pain of my recent breakup with my girlfriend (well, ex-girlfriend) Christy. Equally good songs tell lyrical tales about and an old man, and fresh air. The spartan harmonies blend musically with the innovative sounds of the latinized folk music. Don't be surprised if this album knocks your socks off, as it did mine. Now I can't find them. i suspect my cat has taken them."
4,cute story,"Most children enjoy a story where they find themselves knowing more than the main character and this is the perfect one.The main character, Stanley, a mouse, mistakes the moon riding low in the sky for a piece of cheese. This causes no end of funny moments that even my older children found amusing."
5,Another under the radar western sure to please,I am allways amazed how you NEVER see some movies on TV. Jeff Chandler was a great hollywood actor whose life was tragically cut short by a botched routine operation. Any doubts buy his war sagas like Merrill's Mauraders and if Amazon has one left AWAY ALL BOATS! But this is about one of his westerns. THE JAYHAWKERS. they pair him up with a man known for tv shows not movies. Fess Parker. Known as Walt Disney's DAVY CROCKETT & ABC early days network bedrock DANIEL BOONE. The chemistry is magic and makes this western loosely based on Quantrill's Raiders riveting. Definately worth the price'
3,Confusing,"There are several albums with the INSIDE and TAJ MAHAL name by Paul Horn. Inside the Taj Mahal II is not the same as Inside II. Inside the Taj Mahal I&II; is not the same as Inside the Taj Mahal and Inside II. Inside II may or not have been recorded inside the Taj (I don't own it), but it is the album that includes the Bach chorales etc.Inside the Taj Mahal I & II"
1,Name-droppers R Us,"If you want a book that's all name-dropping with nothing of value to say, then buy this book NOW!"
4,CANDIDATES READ THIS BOOK!,"A recent New York Times Magazine cover focused on the republican youth movement sweeping through colleges and universities. I'm not old enough to know this, but I bet there was a similar cover about the democratic movement back in the sixties and what a shame that young Americans today have no sense of what it means to be a democrat. This is precisely what Danny Goldberg writes about--how the democrats abandoned all of us (I'm 28 and I did not vote in the last election). Goldberg's book is important not only for its historical perspective with regards to politics but more specifically for its cultural history and how the two used to support each other and how they now collide and collapse. And he does not leave us hanging. He has ideas for the future. Ideas that make sense. all those candidate ought to read this book. I read it in a single sitting. only got up once to reload some cds for th emood music it so justly deserves!"
3,Very Original,"The book's not particularly well written, though it wasn't badly written.The cocept is very imaginitive, though I thought the underlying theme of racism was a bit preachy. Overall, the book's fairly predictable, but has some interesting twists. If you're a fan of the detective. genre, it's worth the read. If you're just a fan of the movie, I'd suggest you skip it."
3,Entertaining enough,"Downloaded this on my Kindle once I found out that the movie was based on a book. In some ways, it's more clever than the movie, but the writing is a little clumsy."
4,Why censor Roger Rabbit?,"Written in noir style, this book is a departure from the familiarity of the 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' fan base. Eddie Valiant does the narration throughout the story, and while it's enjoyable, it's sometimes a little overt. From the flirtatious innuendos to the cliched metaphors, it screams detective novel at you through and through.It's an interesting read, if nothing else, to better understand the origins of the hit Disney film's characters. By the end of the book, however, I had my own image of who Roger Rabbit and Eddie Valiant were and they were not the spoon-fed Disney characters. I'd definitely recommend it if you like the cheesy noir style writing or are a fan of the movie inspired by the book."
4,"Not the movie, and that's not particularly a bad thing","I love this movie, so finally taking a stab at the source material had me excited. Besides some of the same names from the movie, this is an entirely different story. Even the characters you know (Eddie, Roger, and Jessica) are different than their celluloid counterparts. Don't expect Jessica to suddenly start cooing about her honey bunny Roger. But all that still leads me to say that this was a very entertaining book, one that had me hooked trying to figure out the mystery."
5,Decorated Tumbler,"I love this book! I am a big fan of Hazel Marie Weatherman books, particularly this one. Talk about Kitsch! I think she was way before her time when she started this catalogue of collectibles. If you love stripes, florals, pink elephants, 50's gold/black coins and diamonds, etc, you will love looking at this book. Almost any pattern from the 20's through the 70's from prominant to small, obscure companies are in this book. If you collect glassware or barware this is a must have. Get it now! You'll find what you need, and you may even have to get one for a friend."
2,"Okay, if you like silly trick questions.....","I purchased this for my children (ages 10 & 12) and my husband and I. I read the reviews and thought it sounded great. Unfortunately it didn't meet up to my expectations. Most of the questions are silly trick questions...QUESTION ""How many birthdays does the average man have?"" ANSWER "" 1 ""QUESTION ""Some months have 31 days, how many have 28?"" ANSWER ""All of them"".Some are good trivia questions like...QUESTION ""What states border Montana?"" ANSWER ""Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming"" orQUESTION ""Can you name the 5 great lakes?""If more of the questions were actually basic trivia questions that everyone should know (but a lot of people don't) it would be funny and informative but the trick questions are irritating. We didn't find them funny, just annoying.Last example...QUESTION ""In Morocco, you can't take a photo of a man with a fez. Why not?"" ANSWER...""Because you can't take a picture with a fez. You need a camera""."
3,Slightly dissapointing,"The questions on the cards were mostly stupid stumpers, where if you listen carefully you can easily see what they were trying to get you to say. There were a few trivia questions thrown in so it was a strange mix. OVerall it was a dissapointment because we got through the whole deck of cards in less than 30 min. Amusing but not enough content."
5,Belonging no matter where you are,"A great collection of stories about fitting in and belonging, which will resonate with most people, set in against the backdrop of Donegal, Boston and Nicaragua. An enriching and enjoyable."
4,Good cop and bad guy chase,"It was an entertaining 300 pages, a good read if you don't need 100% credibility."
1,Very disappointed,"Being the name brand that it is, I was very disappointed with the quality and design of this product.It has a horrible vibration while using it, that comes & goes.It is very wide, so holding it for any length of time starts to hurt your hand.The attachments do not stay in, they fall out quite quickly making it very frustrating.You cannot find the tube pads for the attachments, I had to resort to using my Dremel attachments that are they same size only a bit shorter and using the Dremel pads as well.The flat pads for this are also very hard to find, they are not sold under the Porter Cable name, but some unbranded packaging with in very small lettering it reads, ""to be used on Porter Cable contour Sander"".Very very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it at all.I only wish my warranty was not up, Id send it back in a heartbeat."
3,Call the Devil by His Oldest Name,"Read all three books because i grew up in and live in TN, know all the areas of the book."
5,Essential to understanding the USSR,"This collection of essays is an excellent introduction to understanding two things about Russia: (1) the incredible accomplishments of the October 1917 revolution and (2) the degeneration that led to Stalinist dictatorship and why this degeneration occurred. The essays I'd recommend most highly are Ahmed Shawki's ""80 Years Since The Russian Revolution"" (for the accomplishments and why it should be looked to as a model) and Chris Harman's ""How The Revolution Was Lost"" (for the degeneration that occurred and an explanation of why). I highly recommend it to anyone fighting for social change who's willing to hear an argument for fighting for a fundamentally different kind of society--a society based on human need, not profits for the few."
4,A true classic,"This was one of the scariest movies to me when I was a child. I saw this movie in the late seventies on TV. It starts off like a lot of horror movies of the era and starts out a little bit slow. It is one of the few movies that Harrison Ford was in but don't hear about. It also stars James Farrentino who was a well known actor of the time. It starts out in a girls prepartory school and strange things start happening. Mysterious fires start to happen for no apparent reason and Farrentino's character which was a priest who dies at the beginning is sent back to fight evil. Also, Harrison Ford's character meets a particularly guesome fate. At the end, one the characters at the school becomes possessed and Farrentino's character must do battle with them. The special effects of this scene are pretty good for the time and the creepy atmosphere that the film and music create are great. A must see for any fan of this film genre."
3,San Sucres,"Husband loves flavor and texture but sometimes upsets his stomach. Mocha cappuccino his favorite followed by the plain chocolate (not chocolate cheesecake, just plain). NOT VEGAN though so beware if you are vegan."
2,Low fat sf pudding,I like the regular chocolate flavor but this flavor was way too bitter for my taste
3,Brutally DIFFICULT!!!,"This thing is hard, because this one lets you make a bit of progress and then you'll get a cheap death! Are the graphics good? Yes. As soon as you get this thing you might as well turn the brightness way up."
3,Can not rate this yet,"I bought this product for my Dad as a Fathers Day gift.I cann't give it a rateing but know that he will enjoy them.I read the reviews and took a chance.The product came on time and looks new,the cd's come in a plastic case and are well protected.I know that these old time radio shows will take him back to his childhood days."
1,Living on the Beatles coat-tails???,"Obviously, Spencer Leigh and Alan Clayson haven't written enough books on the Beatles....here's another one...sighhh. I wonder if either of them have ever had a real life and have ever experienced (or accomplished) anything for themselves, and not through (on the coat tails of) the Beatles. Nonetheless, their rantings and ravings on all types of non-interesting topics and tidbits of the Beatles in this book makes it so obvious that they have nothing left interesting to say and that this is just another chance to remind the world that they are out there and are desparate to be heard. Here's another myth debunked: This book is worth buying."
1,Hack writing covered up as a reference work,"I am unsure as to who gets books like this published. These 101 ""myths"" are ""debunked"" using hack writing, non-facts, theorization, scare tactics and shock value. This seems to be the process that the authors went through:1) A fact (""Lucy In The Sky"" was based on a Julian drawing) is taken2) That fact is then taken and theorized about(""Everyone's seen the drawing but are they lying?"")3) The fact is then skewed and the supposed pretentions of the group are used to ""debunk"" something that's not a myth (""Sure, they all said it was a drawing, but *come on!* That doesn't make sense- it had to be something more because I think so."")Sure some of it makes sense, and could be accepted as good myth-debunking, but the rest is National Enquirer B.S. Save the debunking to Jan Harold Brunvand and the Mythbusters.-The Unknown Reviewer"
5,Great product.,If you want a great product for washing your hair that does not contain harshe chemicals then give is soap a try. It lathers up fast and smells great.
4,Great stuff!,"I have super long, think red hair with layers and waves. This stuff lathers up super easy for being a bar soap which is great. The smell is nice, but it is a bit too strong for me, however, I am getting use to it as I don't notice it much anymore. It rinses out cleanly but your hair is so clean it is tough to run your fingers through it easily WHILE WET. I towel dry my hair and let it finish air drying. Then my hair is super soft and my fingers run easily through my hair. My hair is not tangled. So this soap takes a little getting use to, but overall the product is really great. Now my one complaint was I paid $8 for shipping on this little guy - so watch out for shipping charges."
5,"A fascinating treatise, meticulously researched","God's Two Books: Copernican Cosmology And Biblical Interpretation In Early Modern Science by Kenneth J. Howell (Director of the John Henry Newman Institute of Catholic Thought and Adjunct Professor of Religious Studies, University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana) is a compelling, scholarly study of the upset that cosmic scientific discoveries had upon theological views starting in the 16th and 17th centuries. In an attempt to reconcile seemingly widely disparate views, God's Two Books introduces the idea of ""convergent realism"" to incorporate both empirical and theological points of view into a holistic understanding of the universe. A fascinating treatise, meticulously researched in its science, its history, and its scripture, God's Two Books is strongly recommended reading for those who have found their minds divided between disparate extremes in the question of universal origin and cosmological future."
3,Thorough but academic,"This is probably the best Gershwin biography out there at the moment. It is very factual and academic. I wish that the author wrote in a more lively manner, though. Here we have one of the most fascinating figures of the twentieth century; an incredibly talented composer and pianist; a man who worked on Broadway, in the concert halls, in Hollywood; a man who knew many of the most fascinating figures in entertainment. You would think a biography of his life would be a spell binding page turner. No. This one drags in many places."
3,Chock Full of Information,"This is pretty dreary read. It records an immense amount of information but doesn't deliver a picture of the man. Stil, there's a lot of value here -- particularly with the supplemental material on Ira after George's death, the list of the Gershwin brothers' collaborations, and a thoughtful discography."
1,Chips easily,"We bought two sets of these for camping. I am so disappointed in this product. While the utensils have held up fine (and the utensil case is a great idea), the plates, bowls and mugs have all chipped. Many of them chipped within the first few weeks we used them."
1,Broken enamel out of box,"I bought this and paid extra for quick shipping because I have a camping trip tomorrow. 2 of the cups had large areas where there was no enamel (and seeing the metal underneath made me wonder if it was even a safe metal to eat off of), and several other dishes had cracked enamel. I took a photo, and will see if I can upload it.I expected more from the Coleman brand. This was very disappointing,"
4,Cups will burn you.,"Nice set. Well made and easy to clean. If you like extremely hot beverages, be careful. The cups are not insulated at all, and you will get burned. This might be a good thing when it is extremely cold outside as they will definitely keep your hands warm."
3,Shallow spoons/metal dishes get quite hot,"I think for adults this is an awesome set. My kids have trouble with it. The metal dishes get very hot from hot food which I hadn't considered before buying. In retrospect plastic would have been better for them. Also, the spoons are large and somewhat shallow - my kids found it nearly impossible to eat cereal with them. Again, for adults it would be perfectly fine."
4,Good Purchase,"Purchased this set of dishes for a camping trip and they were perfect. I bought this set at Wal-mart but I don't remember what the price was. The dishes were light weight, easy to clean and good quality. I recommend this product."
1,The merchandise it wasnt ok,"yestarday the merchandise arrived to the final destination. The package it was ok and it was protected. Inside the amazon package it was the original coleman box in exclent condition too. after that, i opened it and there was a cup in to bad condition. The damage it wasnt in the transportation, the personel put the cup in that condition inside the box. otherwise, there are 2 bowls in a not very good condition. Really it is a shame for me, because it is the first time that i buy in amazon, and it was a probe for me, because I will hope to buy my wedding stuff in the page, but now i am in dude. PLEASE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME, BEAUSE I AM TO ANGRY WITH THAT. I AM WAITING YOUR ANSWR AS SOON AS POSIBLE PLEASE. TELL ME IF DO YOU NEED THE PHOTO!!"
4,love the classic campset,"We have used these dishes on several camping trips. They are great, very sturdy, and are way better than paper plates. You just have to be careful when putting hot food on them, the dishes themselves get hot as well. I wish there was a carrying case for the dishes like the flatware. I bought a small tote with a lid to store them in when not in use, but also use for a wash basin when camping. It works out well. Well worth the price for what you get."
4,camping dining set,"The box was a little squished when it arrived and one cup was not made well. You can see the enamel. I'm too lazy to return the entire set for one cup. But even with these two faults, I still love it. I love the red and it seems sturdy. Now I don't have to pull dishes, cups, bowls, and silverware out of my kitchen."
2,Easily damaged during heavily padded packaging,"Just received this set. The enamel was severely chipped, even though it had been packaged very well. If the enamel of this product cracks this easily, I don't want it around my family's food."
2,chipped,After reading the mixed reviews about this product I decided to purchase anyways thinking people were being to hard on the dishes and that's why they were chipping. WRONG!!! I received mine chipped right out of the box. I was so disappointed. You would think a product from Coleman would be better quality.
2,Bummed out!!,"I was really looking forward to getting my new camping enamelware, ecspecially in RED!! Unfortunately, when the box arrived before my first camping trip for the year, the enamel was chipped on almost all of the plates and bowls. I was really let down. I immediately returned it and the seller gave me money back in a timely manner. It was a fair deal, but I think the dishes wasn't packed well enough and just got damaged in transit. :("
2,There must be something better out there.,"Sure, this set is nice looking but the dinnerware sucks. Can't even touch the cup if it has hot coffee in it--what good is that? Same with the plates--if hot food is on the plate don't sit it on your bare legs! Buy heat-resistent plastic instead is my suggestion. The silverware is ok."
4,great for price,"we used these for our trip in the mountains. No problems. not as heavy as i would of liked, but they clean easily, are nice to look at, did not break and the utensils are much better than plastic. I am going to buy another set as it was enough for 4 people, but having to wash each time we at was not so good."
3,Good value,"Bought for $20 thru' Amazon, really good deal as Bass Pro has the identical item for $65!Nice product, but chips a little easily."
1,Stay away from this set,"I wish I would have checked reviews a little closer, including the ones on the Coleman site. The enamel on this is crap. They were sloppy to start with and after one trip camping, the enamel started chipping off. I will update this review when I get the issue settled with Coleman."
3,Very Disappointed! :-(,"The glazing is not up to par. On about half of the pieces, the red glazing is smeared (during the manufacturing process), and there are blobs of, what I think to be, clear top coat glazing pooled at the bottom of some of the dishes. The problem with glazing deficiencies on enamelware is ultimately, you're looking at rust and then surrounding glazing begins to crack away due to the rust spreading underneath the glazing.The flatware will also rust if not dried in the dishwasher (applied heat). We'll see how the plastic handles hold up to the high heat of the dishwasher - they might melt.They're yet another outsourced product from a company that once WAS (past tense) a quality manufacturer. I wonder what Coleman's executive management would think if I catered some food, and served them dinner on these substandard dishes? :-)"
4,Pretty Good,"I bought these on Amazon and used them this past weekend during a camping trip.They held up well. The knives cut thick steaks with no problem and the plates didn't scratch. The coffee cups worked great and the bowls held the salad, fruit and cereal like they were supposed to do. The dishes are metal with enamel over them.The one downfall was having to remove the ""Made in China"" stickers off of every dish prior to use. So now I have a fear of lead poisoning.I wish I had known prior to purchasing, I would've searched for a brand that was ""Made in the USA"".Minus 1 star for not being made in the USA."
3,good essentials set,"This is a good essentials set to have for two people. Very light and sturdy. The downsides are that the spoons are very shallow so they dont hold much liquid, they dont hold heat at all so you have to be careful holding cups and putting plates on your lap, and they get surprisingly hot sitting on a table in the 70 degree heat. I may end up springing for one of the other kits made by MSR or GSI, but for now this kit will work just fine and the price was right."
3,Coleman Speckled Enamelware Dining Kit,"2 of the cups were not usable-they had the whole rim of cups enamel gone, bottoms had chipped enamel. Two plates same way-they chip real easy. We have the blue no problems-thought would make a nice setting."
2,not what I expected/durability,"The plates and bowls chipped the first time I used them. The mugs were already chipped when I got them. Even packing cloth between each plate and bowl didn't help. I love the silverware and the holder, keeps everything together."
1,Enamel chips,"Like other people, I also had the enamel chip on the plates. Also two of the bowls got stuck to gether and when I pried them apart, the enamal chipped again. Can not use the set threw it away."
1,Unhappy Camper,This item arrived in a large box with several other items. The dishes and cups were out of their original box and most were chipped. I shipped it back within an hour of receiving it.
1,"A poor product to begin with, my set was repackaged and damaged","Don't be seduced by the Coleman name, for most buyers this product will be a waste of time and money. When I received this product, even with low expectations due to the cheap price, it was very disappointing. The enamel was inconsistently applied in parts with bubbles and streaks on several of the place setting items. In addition, the place settings had metal showing due to transport wear or poor manufacture on 7 of the 12 items. The silverware was very cheaply made and I wouldn't expect it to last more than a meal or two. My product had also been clearly repackaged by one of Amazon's partners (probably because it was someone else's reject) and was not how it was originally shipped from the manufacturer. I strongly recommend that you consider spending a little more money and buying something that is worth keeping."
1,Horrible junk,"As shown in the pictures I have attached to this product, out of the box the product had huge production issues."
3,"Looks nice, poor finishing","Got this based on recommendations, used it for the first time on week long camping trip.Positives:1) Looks nice2) Properly enameled pieces should be toughNegatives:1) Can't stack mugs so they take up a lot of space2) About 1/4 of pieces had flaws in enamel, some as big as dime sized. See these rusting out in the near future.OK for the price, but there are definitely better kits out there."
2,Chips Included,"Let me say that the only reason that I gave this product 2 stars was because the cups and bowls are Ok. Everything seemed to be well made. The plates looked really good until I looked a little closer. Three of them have chips around the edges. I really expected better quality from Coleman. I would return them but I am so tired of businesses selling junk. I mean who inspects these things before they are sold to a customer.Update: I now understand why the quality of this product is so poor. I was under the impression that all Coleman products were American Made. When I went to wash this set to put it with the other camping equipment, I found on the bottom of each piece a sticker that said Made in China. Don,t get me wrong I am not prejudice in any way. It is just that now I understand why Colemans quality has gotten so poor."
3,OK Coleman plate set,The first set I got had the enamel of the rim of one of the cups completely chipped off. The replacement set had a few spots where the enamel was thinner but intact. I'm worried that with use the enamel will chip off. The utensils are really flat - no curve to them like a set you may use at home.
3,chipped after washing and hitting together,"I liked the product, but some chips occured after washing.We used it for GS at camp and the dishes must bang together in the bag, and this may cause some shpping too. All in all we liked the product, my concern was can this be used chipped?"
4,Great set! Very happy with this purchase!,"I've been on a camping supplies spree lately, and after returning or replacing a number of items, I have to say I was pretty surprised with this set. It's GREAT!!! The colors are bright and vivid (red with speckles, as shown in the photos), there are NO sharp edges, and the utensils bag is a nice plus. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I'd like the silverware to be a touch ""tougher""... they're sturdy and will hold up I'm sure, but I don't want to feel like I might bend my fork while eating a steak. Also, and this is just me being picky, I really wish there was a case or bag of some sort to keep everything together. Then again, everything will eventually end up in a plastic bin, so who cares!"
3,OK...not as high of quality as I expected,"Nicer than using paper plates. But if the plates/cups/bowls come anywhere near heat, they will melt all the way through--not the vintage-style tin cups of yore that I expected. Silverware in the roll-up thing is nice, but they're not very heavy duty. The set would've been much nicer if the whole thing came with a storage pack of some kind, not just the silverware. Also, the Coleman Nylon Utensil set which is a complementary product for this dining set is a complete waste of money...you can get utensils of equal quality from your local dollar store. As an alternative for dining while camping, I recommend the Light My Fire meal kits: http://www.amazon.com/Light-My-Fire-Outdoor-MealKit/dp/B0013L4EL6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=sporting-goods&qid=1287444026&sr=8-1."
3,Not the right picture,"Just a note, to indicate that we twice recieved a set that is all red with speckles, not white with red edges. Amazon really tried but they don't seem to have what is pictured."
1,Chips everytime I use them,I see blue enamel floating in the cups and bowls everytime I use them. Also when i wash them there are a few chips in the wash bin. I wanted to like them but they are going in the trash.
3,Not too bad,Wanted a dedicated set for the camper and they have worked out ok. Already a couple of chips on the plates but I can live with it.
4,all as promised,Everything was as advertised and shipped as promised. This was a gift and was received in plenty of time for the wedding without a hitch.
4,Coleman Dining Kit,"I recently purchased this to use at home for outside and inside meals. We like the size of the bowls and the dinnerplates.. The silverware is heavy duty and we are very impressed with the quailty of the product.We aren't campers, but we do cookout and these are alot nicer then paper plates for the outside.. They aren't blowing away..I would recommend these to others and for the price they are really a great value."
5,sturdy,I will probably order another set of these for our RV. The picture of the dishes does not show how sturdy they are are in your hands. The entire set will work perfect when we canoe down the river this summer. Definelty worth the price!
4,Camp dishes,"I love the color red for these dishes. These are great for a backyard bbq or beside a campfire. Have only had for a month, but so far the quality seems fine."
4,Tender and Realistic.,"When Feena Harvey sees a little boy being abused by his mother, she 'rescues' him from her. Soon, she is hiding out with this little boy, named Christopher, with help from the most popular girl in school, Raylene Watson. Througout the course of this book, Feena stuggles with the difficulties all parents face, her relationship with her own mother, and the idea of right vs. wrong. Feena and Raylene's situation is not the every-day kind of things everyone faces, but still plausible. 'Waiting for Christopher' gives a realistic portrayal of child abuse. While the ending is sad, it, again, strikes as true-to-life. The friendship between the two girls is very well thought out. I can relate to Feena's feelings towards Ray before they became friends, and Feena's amazement afterwards, that Raylene would actually WANT to be friends, is perfectly believeable. Overall, 'Waiting for Christopher' is a touching story without being overly sappy, and a very good read."
3,Still Waiting,"""Waiting For Christopher"" is a good book in its own way, but really didn't really stick out to me. The fact that it made me cry within the first 10 pages kind of turned me off to it. It is not badly written, but it lacks a way to grab the reader in and keep them intrigued. Also, the ending of the novel was just too depressing for me. All-in-all, it was a good book with an okay storyline."
5,Wonderful book,"One of the best by this always intriguing author. In the costumes of 100 years ago, Beatrix Potter grieves for an old love and finds that the greatest love of all comes from loving oneself within. A motley crew of animals aid her in her quest for self-realization. A missing painting case is brought to a successful conclusion. Seven more books are expected to follow this well-researched placement. Once you get started with one, you can't help it, you must follow this Texas author's trail wherever she decides to lead one, for she is the Pied Piper of literature."
1,SUCKS,"Bad fit for 22re, late 80's 4runner. Driver is too short, sleeve is slightly too tight. This was obviously not checked for this application. Required lots of effort to make work at all."
4,yum,"I try to buy local as much as possible, because I don't want to contribute to all this oil usage in shipping - but I just had to try this cheese once. It was so good. Maybe I will have to increase it from ""once"" to ""once a year"", because I don't think I can just avoid it for the rest of my life. Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the ecological impact. If you live in New Zealand, consider this a five star review. Of course, if you live in New Zealand, you probably already know about this cheese and don't need Amazon reviews to tell you how good it is."
4,Carbon Copy,"This is a wonderful carbon copy of the original catalog. It does not have any modern insight or text on the period. Only the original catalog pages and descriptions. There are not any photographs either. The engravings and descriptions are detailed and precise. It covers various styles for different age groups, accessories, shoes, hats, undergarments, et cetera. The original descriptions are helpful as well. A moderate knowledge of early twentieth century fashion/fabric terminology helps. Just imagine thumbing through a modern Sears catalog....it's pretty close to the same experience."
3,OK but I think there has to be something better...,"I've made 2 pizzas out of this brand and maybe gluten free doughs are all like this (I'm new at this) but the dough was REALLY runny so I had to improvise and add other GF flours to it. It was REALLY had to get the shaped dough onto the pizza stone! But once it was cooked up with the toppings and sauce, it wasn't that bad hot / warm but was horrid cold.If the other brands are worse tasting, I could go back to this but I'm hoping that there is something better...I like a chewy pizza crust...I'll update my findings as I experiment more."
2,Don't buy more than one box at a time,"If you are truly desperate for pizza and need a gluten-free product, try this one box at a time. I threw the first box away because I thought my bread machine had malfunctioned. Then a friend tried my second box, and he realized the yeast was out of date. The consistency is odd. I use a lot of gluten-free products that are great. I am glad I did not start with this one, or I would have thought that a GF diet would be impossible. Overall my experience with it has been awful."
4,Pizza you can enjoy,Great mix for pizza crust for those who are gluten intolerant. Makes great crust. Holds up well and taste good too.
1,didn't recieve 6 boxes,"HI, frustrated with amazon and arrowhead mills. Have only recieved 1 box. becareful. I am working on getting an exchange, amazon won't refund my return. Arrowhead mills is not interested in helping because they are not the orginal supplier. Two years ago I received moldy bread from amazon and Ener-G took care of me. What a difference! My last order from amason of arrowhead mils products was wrong, too. They sent me whole wheat cookie mix instead of gluten free! Hmmm, someone is dropping the ball for arrowhead mills."
4,Dallas Cowboys Game Pad Pro controller is EXCELLENT,My husband really enjoys this Dallas cowboys controller even though it isn't wireless. All of our other controllers are wireless and still he prefers this one because he loves the cowboys so much! Great deal for making a Football Fan happy!
1,Dallas Cowboys Controller,"I am very disappointed with your product. I bought this controller a little over a month ago, and it no longer works. If this is the kind of service that I get from Amazon.com, then I will no longer shop here."
1,This stupid case doesn't fit the stiletto 2,"What a joke this case is. I've had it for about a year, and finally decided I could no longer go without telling people how shoddy this thing is. It's completely over sized, and it blocks off the power button, so you have to either, cut it, or remove it every time you turn it on and off. This is an example of how not to make a product."
2,Rugged case,This is Not the best case I have used on an electronic product. It is loose and covers some of the conection holes. I would not recomend this product.
5,"Major wants a wife more than anything. He finds one, Jenny.","I think this book is so good. It shows how much a man would do for his wife. Jenny is a good role model, because she has such a good faith in God. She is sweet and kind. Major is a good man, too. He wants more than anything, a wife. I thought it was so great when he met her. He thought she was a angel. I wouldn't blame Layton for not wanting Jenny to marry Major. He just loved his daughter enough to want her to live happily. When he sees how king and generous Major is, he accepts the fact that Jenny will marry him. I would want anyone to read this. It will make you laugh and cry. Out of ten, ten being the best, one being the worst, I give this a ten and a half."
5,Learning more about my on ancesters,"I have several books about Major Ray and his wife, but also my research includes the friends of his the giant Capt. Shields and his wife, they were my 3 time great grand parents. There relationship with Major Ray and his wife is a great story."
4,About Time,"In an age where Evangelical Christianity is associated with politics, John MacArthur finally exposes the flaws of their social gospel. He argues that politics is essentially useless for Christians and is contrary to the New Testament. The only flaws to this book were1)John MacArthur says there are rare occasions for Christians to get politically involved, yet doesn't really give any examples. Plus this contradicts the sermon at the end of the book by the famous Charles Spurgeon which says we should never be involved.2)His part of the book of what a government following Christian values seems to go against the principle of the rest of the book."
4,An unappreciated effort,"Prior reviewers seem stymied by a purported MacArthur ""dichotomy"" in his theme, which I don't get. Ignore them. Read the book"
1,Misleading Title,"A more appropriate title to this book would be ""Why to obey government at all costs"". The author makes the shockingly misinformed argument that governments through history are generally good and just. Truly, this has not been the case. Curious as to why so many Christians in Nazi Germany went along with Hitler's evil plans? It was arguments like this.If you are interested in this topic, I would suggest reading Dr. Cobin's ""Bible and Government""."
1,pietism can not save,"While I generally appreciate John MacArthur's writing on a host of issues, he has fallen well short of his own standard in this work. Rather than present a biblically based agenda for the Christian's role in the world, the author only succeeds to respond to the excesses of some Christians in the sphere of politics. In some ways, this book surpasses Cal Thomas and Ed Dobson in their controversial work, Blinded by Might. MacArthur's ability to take Scripture out of context and to use both Scripture and history as he sees fit is alarming considering his track record of fine teaching. Clearly, history does record many abuses that Christian's have fallen prey to in their zeal for cultural transformation. But MacArthur throws the baby out with the bathwater. The author could have brought careful scriptural analysis and thoughtful historical reflection to his subject, but failed to administer both."
4,A wonderful product!,I had purchased and used the chocolate from a store in my home town. I loved it because of its texture and low calories but they carried just this one flavor. I noticed on the box that it came in other flavors so I came to your site and found all of them. I love them all except the lemon which is difficult to tell that it is lemon. I think I will try adding some real lemon juice the next time I use it. I highly reccomend Sans Sucre's Mousse Mixes and will buy again when I use the dozen I ordered!!!!
4,French Vanilla Mousse,This is a good easy sugar free dessert. Served alone or over a few fresh berries it is very good. I will buy this item again.
1,Her Worst!,I'm a huge fan of LLM. I've almost all of her books and loved them. So I though I would give this a try. It was not well written. I didn't even finish the book.
1,Escape from Cabriz,"This' heroine"" was the biggest waste of skin. When she wasn't whimpering, she was sobbing. The stupidity factor was through the roof. The Darwin theory should have set in - which meant she would have been dead by page 25. If that had been the case, I would have applauded. Then the hero could go find someone worthwhile. I like Miller's books usually, but I have never before read about such an insipid female character."
5,amazing debut!!,"wow this record is all its hyped up to be and more. Tight as can be but still holds on to its rock and roll baby! the first 6 tracks could concievably be 6 number one songs of the year! And the rest of the record doesn't dissapoint either, esspecailly the last song! you can not go wrong with this record!! you will love it like I do!"
4,not ashamed,"I was surprised when I listened to this cd. Please understand I don't pay full price for nothing. I found it at a clearence section at a local cd buy, sell, trade store. It stayed in my car for two weeks until I was making a errand and decided to give it an ear. This band rocks. More importantly they are not ashamed to be a christian rock band. In an age where it okay to be a christian in a rock band, not a christian rock band it was refreshing. BDA should have tried to be more original in their melodys. Some of it was predictible. O, and I can't stand when bands use letters for the name of a band. In two years or so it will get on your nerves when you can't remember what BDA stands for. Other than that I look foward in seeing what this band will do next."
2,"Some interesting items,but lots of padding and unpleasantness","The book has a fair number of interesting case histories, and some of them are told concisely.The book is marred, though, by lots of padding (e.g., the biographies of various medical detectives--who cares), immaterial technical details (the condition of President Kennedy's corpse), and unpleasant contents. (The last is inherent in the subject, admittedly)."
3,not as good as GTA,"As I said above Driver is not as good as Grand Theft Auto. Graphics are really jaggey, though, but better than GTA's 2-D graphics. There are only 4 cities to drive in but they are alot of fun. The reason I said that it is not as good as GTA is because you can't steal other cars, and you can't shoot people. But, don't think that Driver is not a good game, it is. It has a great 3 person shooter and the gameplay is just plain FUN."
3,"A SO ,SO GAME",YOU WILL LIKE THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED IT BEFORE. IT IS A SO SO GAME. I KIND OF LIKE IT. THE ONLY THING I LIKE ABOUT ITIS TAKING A RIDE. BUT DONT TAKE ME WRONG IT IS A GOOD GAME.
3,Is there that many cops in one city?,"I found this game very entertaining.The graphics were very well done and the gameplay is very good for a driving game.The only downfall is that the police are a little too agressive.No real police officer would run you off the road for a little speeding violation.But overall,it is a very good game.If you like to wreck cars(hopefully not for real) and just have a good drive,purchase this title."
3,great game but...,this was a great game but it was very easy to complete. i was hooked for a month before i was done. i would reccomend it if you dont play the playstation often.
4,a cool motivational theme to outrun everyone!,"the game starts and you have to "" earn your stripes"", so to speak. you can't go to the real game, without passing this first test. i spent about 20 minutes, and 10 tries to get through. but once your in, it's pretty fun.you are an under cover cop, turned get-away driver. good graphics,cool crashes,and high speed.chases. the only complaint i have is the "" CRUCIAL"" map, that shows the city streets,and where you need to go, doesnt always show where you are or what direction you need to go.but if you like being a get-away driver, trying to outrun or wreck cop cars,you'll deal with that one complaint.It's not the same old, race against the machine,going around a track. you race in actual cities, with real landmarks."
4,Very fun and entertaining.,This is the very first driver game to come out. It is a very fun game at the begining because u can do anything that u want to. However u cannot get out of ur car but it is fun to drive around and destroy things. The graphics r not that good but it is an old game even for the ps1. The cops r hard to get away from but that makes it challenging and fun. Not trying to make fun of anybody but the cops r fat too so it is so funny to watch them get out of their cars and walk around. I would tell more but it has been a long time since i have played it because it broke a long time ago. This is a great game that started it all.
5,A forgotten treasure,"I played this game when I was young. I remember having a blast with it. So I decided to get it again.I had forgotten a lot about the game but I still enjoyed it as much as I did when I was younger.In order to start everything you have to take a driving test. If you have no idea what to do (because it ask you to do things you probably won't understand) it has a tutorial. It took a couple of tries and I was on the road.It has a main story line that requires you to do driving jobs and make yourself known in the criminal world. The story itself isn't bad but not great.There is other ways to play. Things like time attack, dirt track, and my favorite survival.The graphics held up pretty well over time. Considering this is a PS1 game.Oh the film editor which allows you to create your own replay is a WONDERFUL idea. Something that seems to be ahead of it's time."
1,Qualifying test is too hard!,"I could not complete the driver test you have to beat before the game opens up. It was way to hard! I consider myself an average gamer, but I tried and tried and couldn't complete all the things it wants you to do before the game opens up. So all I could do was drive around two cities. For a driving game, I'll wait and get Grand Turismo II. Why did they make the entry level so frustrating? Maybe it's fun after that, but who knows? Poorly thought out by the developer."
2,Not worth it,"Definitely a waste of time and money. The driving is realistic and the story line works up to the point called ""president's run"". This level is close to impossible and leaves you ready to toss the whole game out the window. Without failure you are hurt from all sides by both the police and the bad guys turning your car a wreck in a short time where you eject the disk and send it flying."
1,HEY DRIVER LET ME OFF!,"I try to do a trick on the undercover section,but is hard to do that,I try and try but I can't even pass the test.This game is not good,the graphic look horrible.yack!!"
4,Fun for a few days....,"Driver, which is all about running away from the police and fulfilling the requests of the underworld, is a lot of fun at first. After finishing the game in a day or two, it becomes somewhat monotonous due to the limited number of cities and the limited number of vehicles that you can drive with. Also, the graphics and game play can be very clunky and the game itself is poorly designed. The only reason why they can get away with it is because it is kind of fun to be chased by the police all over San Francisco and New York.I think that they should really have tested the game more extensively though before releasing it because it looks like they forgot to put the finishing touches on it.Final word: If you are looking for some entertainment for a couple of days the current price of ... is not too bad. ...."
4,Get Driver if you are a real experenced gamer,Driver is a real fun game but very hard.When you go to undrecoverand and you have to do all all those tricks in a minute it seems impossible.I have hade driver for a year and I still can't beat the first level of undercover.That is why I am giving this game a 4 star.If you wan't a really fun game get Need For Speed:High Stakes
4,A Good Solid Effort,"This is one of the best car and racing games ever. I mean how can you not like a game that has 70's muscle cars in it!! Granted there are better games out their(such as GTA 3, and Driver 2) but this game really gives you a run for your money! BUY this if you like car games, look at the price how can you miss out on a deal like this!"
3,A limited yet intriguing game.......,"Taking the first right in San Francisco, I barrel down the street, winging the two successive and massive jumps. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the expierence, the game has its limits. Primeraly, the largest limatation is the inability to replace my old, and usually wrecked, car. To be succinct, Driver is really to limited for maximum enjoyment; albeit, the idea of driving wrecklessly and commiting a myriad of other violent offences is very contemptable to me, the game is really incomplete without more objectives.Thus, I would recommend this game for the player who merely has a habit of playing now and then, but not for the hardcore gamer. Rock on!"
5,DRIVER THE COOOOOLEST GAME,DRIVER IS COOOL I PLAYED THE GAME EVERYSINGLE DAY AND IT DIDN'T GET BORED. THE GAME IS 5 STARS THE GRAPHICKS ARE GREAT THE SOUND OF MOTOR AND OTHER PARTS OF THE CAR IS WONDERFUL DRIVER HAS LOTS OF LEVELS WHITH DIFERENT CARS AND CITYS SOOOOOOOO TTTHHHHHEEE GGGGAAAAAMMMMMEEEE IIIIIISSSSS CCCCCCCOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLL
2,average,"Driver is a good game that follows the typical undercover cop in the midst of a crimeworld scheme. Driver is more about accomplishing missions for the sake of seeing the next film clip, rather than for the fun of playing the game. It gets to the point after 10 or 12 missions where the game gets tedious and possibly even boring, same missions (different setting), and the same car (different color) over and over. I believe that the makers of the game must have given up at some point and said ""That's good enough"", personally not the attitude I would like to have going into a game I was considering purchasing. Overall plot could use a little work too.Decision: If you already have every other game, you might as well complete your collection."
2,Unclear product description,"When the word ""Kit"" or ""Ends"" (plural) are used one would expect more than ONE! The cost seemed too good to be true and it was. Now I have an unknown tie rod end weather it is inside or outside I have not put the effort to find out. When I received item I was not happy. I just straightened the bent ones out and going to cross my fingers they don't break... Would not purchase again.... Buyers beware..."
2,STRANGLING THE POULTRY,"Kevin and Kenny work at a music store. Kevin is very self indulgent, purchasing vast amount of tissues and motion lotion. The girls think of him as a geek. When people around him start getting murdered, the police suspect him.The story has a unique theme. There are no real special effects. The acting starts out mediocre and digresses for some reason as does the film. TV soap actress Robyn Griggs, whose name is plastered across the top of the DVD as the star of this film appeared to have lost her acting ability with this role as things progressed to their lowest level.No blood. No Gore. No nudity. Under the covers sex. If seeing Robyn Griggs in a bra is you life's goal, this is your film."
5,Scary made-for-TV stuff,"Why is this movie so darn scary? I don't really know, but it is. I saw this in the early 80's when I was over at my girlfriend's house and I still remember it very well. The last shot in the movie is really a corker. I can only hope this gets released on DVD at some point. I'm not saying it's the greatest movie ever but there is just something about it that works very well at giving you the willies."
4,"Creepy when I was a kid, but didn't hold to the test of time","I searched and searched for this movie for years and finally found it. What once scared the crap out of me made me laugh. The acting is terrible, for one, and the film itself is very dated. It does have a good basis for a story, but it simply doesn't hold to the test of time. If you saw this one when you were younger, just remember it. Don't try to find it and ruin what you remember."
2,dead pixel present,bad unite. dead pixels present on screen.how can you sale this unite to consumers?
1,Pale Imitation Of Duke Nukem 3D,"Nowhere near as good as the Duke Nukem 3D for IBM platform. Looks a lot like Contra from the NES days. If you are looking for the same action as Duke Nukem 3D, look elsewhere as this does not contain first person graphics, Duke sound effects, etc. I am very sorry that I bought this."
3,Duke Nukem on GBC,"I came into the game with high expectations, and I can't say that I was dissapointed. The game was actually one of the better games on the GBC during it's time of release, but now...GRAPHICS- Bloody, Duke will walk no more than 5 feet and see blood all over the wall, not that that is a bad thing. Now I have to admitt that the detail is really nice and colorful, but Duke himself is rather bland. Oh and the cut scenes are awsome!SOUND- The shotgun sounds great, but as unfortunate as it is, every weapon after that sounds exactly the same. On a positive note, the game does have an impressive soundtrack.GAMEPLAY- This is where the game wrecks everything that it otherwise had going for it. Slow movement, fast bullets, almost impossible to dodge. The game runs in five simple steps.1.shoot2.see the awsome blood effects3.get shot4.find health5.repeatIn conclusion, the game is good, you just know how to work with it, but most players will find this a frustrating, hit and run miss."
3,"Too much background music, not enough of the main theme","It's been decades since I saw this film, but the main theme music shows up once in a while in compilations. I was looking forward to this album, but it's somewhat of a disappointment. Most of the music sounds like jazz they played in the background of a party scene or something. The main theme is barely evident. Pleasant listening, but nothing special."
5,Perfect meditation music,"Halekala is deeply meditative and perfect to background mantra or mala meditation. After listening to it for that purpose for a week or so, it automatically calms and creates an atmosphere of quiet purpose."
3,Misleading Title - not good enough for new exams!,"I have to agree with the postings from March and April - be sure to read those reviews too. This book is well written and has a reasonable structure to it. However, it fails to focus on the newer test properly, omitting valuable and required bodies of knowledge. Since this is one of the few ASE guides out there, use it. But remember that you will have to have alot more than just this to pass the test. I would say the book covers about 75% of current exam material. With an 85% required passing score on the tests, you will be well short even if you memorize every page of this volume."
1,Syngress should be embarrassed,This book is not at all adequate. From what can figure out this book was written for the previous edition of the exams. The new exam numbers are just put on the cover to draw attention. The material is out of date. Don't buy this book.
3,Need more material than this book,"This is a pretty good book to help you understand the frame work on Compaq servers, but for taking the ASE tests you will need more information. With this book alone it coves about 70% of the exam objectives you will need to know to pass. I just passed the 010-397 test and with out the help from the Boson test quizer I would of been popped. Their is a lot of terminology that they skiped on that you need to know and the 8-way processing they do not even mention. In all so far for the price and information you get it is worth it, but you will need more info to pass the tests than the book for sure on the 397 test. With the quizer and the book you should do good."
3,An very good resource,"This book is a bit old, but if you work with older Compaq Servers as I do then it is fine. A valuable resource even if you do not intend to sit the Compaq ASE exams."
1,The material is based on older exams,"For those of you trying to save thousands of dollars by skipping ASE classes, it's not going to happen with this book. I took the Compaq Systems Technologies test today, and at least a third of the questions were not referenced in this book. ( Especially the newer technologies such as the Profusion chipset) If you could magically go back in time and take the older exams (10-056 etc.) this book may be a bit more useful..."
1,"The ""Black Mask"" Edition is a joke.","The Blackmask Edition (ISBN 1-59654-119-9) is terrible. The edition is filled with typesetting errors (a ! instead an I) and it is missing text. Essentially someone downloaded the text and made their own cheap edition. Buy a used edition of this great novel, rather than giving your money to these charlatans."
4,The hero is just 18.,"""A thing can look beautiful or romantic or inspiring only if the beauty or the romance or the inspriration is inside you.""Much of the charm of this classic noir murder is that the hero is just 18. Just when I said this book just needs a femme fatale, Michelle Pfeiffer walks in! And it's about as torrid, I suppose, as 1948 would allow."
4,decent training video,Good starter video for a first time trainer. Gets you and your pup ready for a future in hunting and basic obedience.
1,Too general,General discussion of training a hunting pup. Not enough specific examples of technique. Too much talk and not enough pictures. This is a dvd.
5,Detailed Elephant Info,"Text heavy ELEPHANTS has lots of information! There are three or four paragraphs on each subject covered. Starts with ""Fast Facts"" to grab the reader's attention. Photos are of good quality and some are labeled. Details differences between Asian and African Elephants, food, habitat, life cycle, herds, etc. There is an activity suggested, a glossary, additional resource lists, and an index.

2,wall mount faucet springs a leak!!,"Faucet itself was OK but the pieces used to attach it to the hot & cold water pipes leaked because of poor castings, I would not reccommend this faucet to anyone, especially a do-it-yourselfer."
4,LDR 011-5450 Double Handle Wall Mount Faucet,"Pro:The chrome metal finish is very smooth and blemish free. The metal casting and machining is excellent, very high quality. The spout, hot and cold water handles, moves effortlessly. Good packaging.Con:Although faucet installation is usually straight forward, it would be helpful if the faucet came with some documentation/instructions and a contact phone number (instead of just a postal address) for warranty issues . I did a Google search and found LDR's toll free number (800-545-5230). The faucet came with two hot water handles. I contacted LDR to request a cold water handle.An unbeatable price for this type of faucet. Good wall mounted faucets are very hard to find in hardware stores and if found the price is more expensive than the $26 I paid at Amazon."
3,Poor Salieri!,"First Salieri gets knocked with the absurd story that he murdered Mozart, now he gets this. Axur, re d'Ormus, was considered one of the finest operas of the eighteenth century. I must say that it is a rather nice opera. Musically, it is rich with appealing melodies, nice (and sometimes not so nice) harmonies, and a characteristic charm that only classical-period music has. That was the good...the ugly is the recording quality itself. It was a live performance, but this is no excuse! I have other CDs of live performances and none of them stink like this one. But then again, this is the only recording of Axur around (that I know of), so you sort of have to buy it. I enjoy it for its novelty value. An fair opera (nothing divine like Mozart, quirky like Haydn, or lyrical like Cimarosa), but a terrible recording. I gave it an extra star because they had enough guts to actually record poor old Salieri."
5,good stuff,"have been using this linseed oil for several things over the last few months, so far it is working like linseed oil should. i can't see it doing anything but... :-)"
2,ramblin' man,"Author hand picked the profiles in order to validate his own feelings regarding what makes a person great. Most very powerful figures do not fit into the mold cast by Landrum.Although there are some interesting quotes and stories, Landrum rambles and goes off topic frequently. I would not recommend this book."
2,"Nice product, but...","The bucket is very attractive, a nice size and easy to keep clean. Well insulated, it serves its purpose well. However, when I took it out of the box to wash it for the first time, the handle came off one side. I was able to get it back in, but it comes off with great regularity. Also, the rubber around the lid has come off once. Think it needs a bit more quality control."
3,"Not the top of the Kosta Boda line, NOT crystal, either.","Kosta Boda has a wide range of votives. These, while moderately attractive, are pressed glass--they are NOT crystal, despite what the product description says--and the mold seam is clearly visible (top to bottom) on each side. They are designed to hold tea lights on an informal table, and do a good job at that.. Before buying, you may benefit from seeing what else Kosta Boda offers, such as their Atoll votive, available in a range of colors. See also the Swedish manufacturer Orrefors, which makes a single votive called the Discus votive, as well as a set of three Lightstone votives. The price on any of those will be higher, and so will the quality. The way the light reflects on either of those is superior by far to the snowball votives. Amazon carries both brands; you don't have to go to Sweden for other choices."
2,Maybe these are knock-offs and not authentic?,"My kosta boda votives from years ago have no seams. Makes me wonder if these are fakes. If they are authentic Kosta Boda, the quality seems to have gone down significantly."
5,"Great quality, heavy and stable","My wife wanted to get these after seeing them at a friends house. Kosta Boda pieces are solid quality and these are no exception. Arrived undamaged in nice packaging, took them out and placed them on the counter...they look great!"
3,"Cute, but","It's nice, kinda cute, but the flame of the candle just doesn't light up the ""snowball"" like I hoped."
1,Broken item no replacement,"I purchased the items as a christmas present, they arrived broken and now I have to ask people I wanted to please, to get the trouble and return them. I wanted them replaced as soon as possible, but that was not an option. As the items were glass they hurt the receivers finger."
3,Not Quite the Same,"I bought this to replace one that was over 20 years old. While having the same heft and general look as the older one, it did not quite have the same quality finish as the old one...the seam was particularly noticeable."
1,Oh my god REAL GANG MEMBERS! @~! ~~!~~~,"alot of people cried at this movie because it was sad. I Cried because it was made. ""Oh Real life in the hood"" it seems to me like a blair witch project in south central would be a better title. The acting was poor. to some this movie up. "" A Real long Rap Video"""
1,crap,"ohh your arms are so big you fight very very well, (...) that machine gun was to big for that crab to evn hold without fallen over, it reminded of the guys that kidnaped that dude in MALIBU'S MOST WANTED"
5,Charming Eeyore,The Eeyore Italian Charm Link was TREMENDOUS. Looks like the real Eeyore on Disney merchandise. Quality was outstanding. Would buy this seller's merchandise in a heartbeat.
3,Decent enough,"The first unit I bought was DOA, so I had to get a replacement from Amazon. Since it was being given as a Christmas present, having a defective unit arrive definitely didn't give me a very good first impression.However, the second unit worked just fine. It does NOT look like the picture though - the lightning arcs are fewer and not nearly as well defined. But for a cheap decoration, it works out pretty well, especially for a kids' room.But if you're looking for a more impressive decorative light, you should keep looking. This lamp is built cheap, and looks cheap."
2,Cold humor.,"Loved ""Beat the Reaper"" so you can't say I'm squeamish, but this book seemed to lack a moral compass, likable characters, true humor, page-turning writing. The writing is competent, but cold. As for the killings, innocent people are killed, but it's kind of OK because most of them are presented as personally flawed: This one is a womanizer, that one is rude, this one has bad breath. If you don't find it taking off for you by page 100, give up."
5,Devoutly Domingo,After seeing the first Three Tenors video I became a true Domingo fan. Not only do I have the DVD but I also have the video .. so of course I tracked down everything Domingo. When I came across the video of An evening with Plaacido Domingo I was so happy with the video I had to have the DVD. His choice of songs was great .. and of course there is that magnificent voice. I would say that of all my videos and DVDs this is one of the best.
3,Domingo's Show!,"This is a nice concert if Marta Senn wasn't in it, I'd like it even better. She isn't my cup of Lipton and judging by how much we've heard of her in the opera world, not a lot of other people cared for her. Other than that Domingo did a great job as ususal in concert. I have the VHS and Laser of this performance and prefer them to the DVD for one reason, the lack of lighting. This DVD is very, very dark! Perhaps I have one that should have been recalled but I was extremely disappointed in the fact that I couldn't see anyone on stage! Too dark and the tape and laser are not. Cheap DVD pressing? I don't know but that is why I've listed only 3 stars. Darkness and Marta Senn too off two. Domingo, as usual is 5 star and if you are a fan, of course you must have this disc in your collection."
5,Great CD,I first heard this song and I really liked it and you had it and I am such a huge Kenny fan so I had to have it!
4,Great Starter Book,"I thought this book was a great starter book for those who have little knowledge of AA worship. My main problem with the text it is a little to academic for the masses - a little too much jargon. But I could relate to much of what stated from my personal and family experiences.A book that gives you more details of how Africans evolved into Afro Baptist, I would highly recommend Mechal Sobel's Been in the Storm Too Long."" This book is excellent and can compliment this book. She deserves reading. She speaks truth."
3,"Small text, cover looks kind of ""cheesey""","Actually there was a lot of good information in this book. It is really for a new cook but had some things in there that were new to me, a very experienced cook. I almost didn't gift this to my daughter-in-law because the cover looked really ""cheesey"" and the paper the book was printed on was very cheap. Good content in a not-great package."
3,Useful Information Overshadowed By Author's Poor Attitude,"Shapiro provides much valuable information near the 2nd part of her book as to the practical specifics of starting a tutoring business. However, I find the benefit of this information to be overshadowed by her nasty, anti-teacher attitude. Her comments and tone suggest that teachers are lazy, selfish, and unwilling to help their students outside of the confines of the daily class period. As a former teacher, I am totally offended; that is simply a huge generalization to make about an entire profession. Every profession has its losers, but teaching has no more than any other vocation.This poor attitude, in addition to the author's cocky tone, seriously compromised the value of this book. Tutoring is one of the easiest businesses to launch; take the $12.89 this book costs and instead put it toward your classified ad."
5,Spectacular find for your continuing enlightenment!,"This album lifted me beyond my wildest dreams. I do believe that this single collection has been instrumental in a new heightened sense of awareness and being for me. Listening to these selections has become an almost daily affair.... and each time I listen I gain a renewed sense of happiness, joy and of total fulfillment!"
3,A matter of taste,"I liked this disc less than the other 8 U have. Deuter, in my eyes, is a briliant composer but ""Nirvana Road"" somehow sounds more or less like other of Deuter's discs."
1,Good maybe once,"The Chinese quality of this product is horrible. This Performance tool is sold by most of the auto parts stores, Auto Zone, O'Reilly, Advance. I used it once and the included crows foot started to bend open and allow the head of the bolt to twist inside. I could feel it doing this and luckily got it on. The 15mm crows foot was no longer ""u"" shaped. I got lucky it worked. With some concern, I later decided to change another belt using the crows foot. Big mistake, i got the old belt off and never could get it back on because the crows foot was wide open. I had to get a ride to the store to purchase a $25 set of crowsfeet to complete the job. The steel is way to soft in this set. Get the Lisle tool, the make a couple of different types. Don't be tempted by this price, I have lost money on it."
1,"Piece of *&$$ , Do ""NOT"" buy","Tried it as soon as I received it, and found out it is ""NOT"" worth it. I was going to inquire as to returning it, And I do have it boxed up and ready, but then I would need to pay restock and return shipping, so I'd rather not deal with it. ""Pay"" the extra ""Buck"" and buy the real thing!!"
1,Junk,The order came with only part of the contents described. On top of that the bar was bent. Do not waste your money.
2,makes parenting feel like a mistake,"OK, so we've only had the baby a week, but this book has been a bummer since before the birth. Every time I open it I feel like I am about to enter a hopeless, frightening maze of difficulties. Either that or a sappy Hallmark-produced TV special. I'm sure the book is factually helpful, but I couldnt get past the style..."
2,makes parenting mostly sound like a bummer,"OK, so we've only had the kid just over a week, but every time I opened this book, both before and after the birth, I felt that I should be tired, harrassed, at my wits end and on the way to the emergency room. That, or in some goo-goo Hallmark card scene. There must be a way to communicate the essentials of the first year without making it sound like either a life-threatening bummer, or a sentimenal mindless goo-goo fest... I'm still looking for the right book..."
3,Dated analysis,"Over 30 years old, the book gives a good analysis of the British economy, prior to the 1973 oil crisis. The authors dissect the balance of payments, foreign trade and the composition of the labour force. Also, the fiscal policies and financial structure of the economy, plus the tax system, are covered.Granted, the book is dated. But the logic patterns of how it analyses an economy may still have some merit."
4,Fun game that provides laughs,"Faces is a party game played in rounds. In the first three rounds, six pictures are shown of men, women and animals, respectively. Some of the animals look better than the people, and I'm not kidding!! The people pics are B&W; and are from the 19th century, judging from the fashion styles seen. In turn, each player chooses one of the pictures to respond to a question asked, like ""Which one looks the grumpiest?"" Others try to guess which picture that played picked. You get to advance on the game board if you do. Then in another round, two pictures are shown, and the person whose turn it is must guess which of the two pictures a certain player submitted. First one to reach the Finish space wins.A fun game that will provide laughs. Some of the pictures are hysterical. This game is out of print, but if you're looking for a party game to add to your collection, consider this one."
4,Fun Game!,"My family and I love this game! There isn't really any skill to it, but it's fun and you get a good laugh."
3,Has the potential to be much better,"I was looking forward to getting the game because it looked like a great game to use as writing prompts or impromptu speaking in my classroom. We played the game as a family (kids 10 and 7), but tired of it quickly. The photos of the people are era specific with little to no diversity and in black and white. I would have loved to have seen modern photos in vibrant colors with a diverse group of people and varying expressions. The animal photos are in color and slightly more interesting. We will probably not play this game often. I think with a late night and a good case of the giggles, it may be comparable to Apples to Apples with photos, but not nearly as fun."
4,great game,This game is hilarious - all ages of our family have had a good laugh playing. Who are those people??
1,Too Many Errors,"I gave this book one star because I could not get past the first few chapters for all the misspellings and grammatical errors. It was too distracting. Please have someone edit this book prior to putting it out there!! For instance, it is not the Lords Prayers. It is the Lord's Prayer. I could go on and on. I simply cannot read any further. Sorry"
1,a lot of Horowitz performance but all are in extremely poor recording quality,"Very very very very very poor recording quality not because of the aged performance but the poor transaction from LP to CD, you will listen a lot of ""click click"" sound, and volume varies in sin wave because of poor turning table is used.I am so regret that I bought this CD.This CD set is in trash quality, please save your money and buy something else."
5,The Best Stainless Steel Cookwear,I bought my Tramontina cookwear because I wanted stainless steel and I liked the way these looked. However once I used them I realized how evenly they cooked and clean up was fast. I have also told by best friend about them and she also has a set. She loves her set as much as I do mine. I am currently looking for another set. This cookwear can be set out from the stove on to the dinner table on a trivet. It looks that good.
3,Feed problem solution,"I have been scanning about 3000 family slides over the past year with a Super Coolscan 5000 ED and an SF-210. For the first 2000 slides I often had trouble with slides jamming during a feed especially if I had more than about 15 slides in the feeder. I decided that the root problem was that the feedspring pressure increased with the number of slides stacked in the feeder and that at a certain point this excessive pressure was the principal reason for a misfeed/jam. So...the solution was to pull the feed pusher way back to a dis-engage position, take the entire scanner and tilt it about 12 degrees off horizontal, and use a C-size battery and gravity to roll it down against the slides to provide a constant feed pressure. This has made a huge difference! I wish I knew about this when I first got this feeder. Let me know if this works for you."
1,"Nikon SF-210 Auto Slide Feeder, Shame on Nikon","I got charged the restocking fee after Amazon's false adverstisement(Nikon Cools Scan V ED + Nikon SF-210 in a bundle, although V EDdoes not support the feeder). But after filing a claim at Amazon, I got all my money back. So no bad feelings towards Amazon. I kept the slide feeder and ordered a Nikon cool scan 5000 ED, because manual slide by slide scanning is not really an option...Now about $1500 later I find out that all the bad reviews about the SF-210 were no exaggeration. This thing is a complete failure! With regular Hama DSR frames I get an error message about every 5 slides. Nikon should be deeply ashamed to throw such a piece of poorly engineered equipment on the market."
1,necessary junk,"this slide feeder is a disgrace to nikon's name. it should cost about $50 given the quality engineering and flimsy plastic found in it. it has trouble with most slides, although heavy plastic mounts seem to do fairly well. cardboard mounts jam frequently. since on their return path slides bend the spring plate, you will find yourself monkeying with it repeatedly until you finally break it.i have 15,000 slides. after some 2,500, it looks like i'll need another one. this is junk, but there isn't anything else out on the market that can offer the same functionality (when it works)."
3,"Okay, but could be better","After reading some of the other reviews, it is with some fear that I bought the slide feeder.Unless you have a very small project, this item is a must have. I am in the middle of a 5000+ slide project. Hand feeding them isn't an option.The scanner worked well initially, handling 400 odd 1980's vintage Kodak processed slides without a hitch. Older slides (Kodak processed from the 1960s and 1970's) resulted in about 1 jam in 100 slides. Slides in poor condition resulted in more jams, particularly dog eraed corners and warped slides. I had a roll that wouldn't feed well. When I went to hand feeding with the single slide loader, I was reminded how much better the auto feeder was and gave up on hand feeding and went back to the feeder with some babysitting.Another disappointment is that it is not compatible with the less expensive coolscan V, requiring the more expensive Coolscan 5000.I have also found that it feeds better running vertically."
3,It sort of works,"This thing is buggy, but 's better than the alternative of hand feeding a large number of slides.Don' buy if you think you are going to put in 50 slides, flip it on and walk away. it will stop on about every 10th slide, jam up, and youll have to go through a process of extracting the slide, and restarting the software.Reaally ashame that Nikon hasn't figure out to manufacture something that is more failsafe. I can think of lots of simple improvements that would make it work better."
2,Item returned,"Item was returned and another purchased because the cake size was smaller than anticipated. Replacement was from same manufacturer, but makes a larger cake, and I am very satisfied with the product. The only reason I rated this product 3 stars is because I did not use it and have returned it."
3,$19.89 for poking out cakes,I only wanted to buy this after experiencing Cuisipro's Snap Fit cookie cutters. America's Test Kitchen has a great cheesecake recipe that I want to try using cottage cheese and yogurt cheese with neufchatel cheese (lowfat cream cheese.)This pan has a glittery appearance.Hand wash onlyMade in China
3,Norpro Mini Cheesecake pan,"A lot smaller than I thought it would be,very light and filmsy but as I am now back in England cant be bothered to return. I have since bought a much better one from Lakeland."
5,Love these pans!,I bought two of these pans about a year ago and liked them so much that I bought two more so I could make more mini cheesecakes at one time! Great quality and very easy to use!
3,so so,"I ordered two of these. In one that I received, one of the circular bottom pieces was a bit misshaped. It still covers the hole in the cup, but just barely. I made cheesecakes in it and it was much more efficient to use this pan than using a circle cutter or ring mold to make the cheese cakes. The only problem I have is that the corner cups cook differently than the rest of the cups, especially the center cups. It's tough to get all the cheesecakes baked evenly."
3,Difficult to remove from pan,"The pan is excellent, I only wish that the cakes were easier to remove from the pan. I had to use a foam building block from my son's toys to evenly push my cheesecakes up and out."
3,Finish didn't last,"I really enjoyed using this pan, but after a few months the non-stick finish started to peel off the ""bottom."" Getting the cook temps and times took a bit to figure out but overall the pan is very easy to use and creates a nice finished product. I just wish the non-stick coating didn't peel so quickly. If I can't get replacement pieces I'll probably look for a different pan to try out."
4,Great product but be careful....,"This is a great pan. I made a gingerbread cake recipe that I normally make in a bunt pan but made mini ones in this pan. The non-stick worked great - especially with Baker's Pam or some equivalent. However, the stainless steel handles (or whatever they're made from) stay very hot, especially in proportion to the rest of the pan. I would still buy it, and may even buy a second, just be warned."
3,Mini Cheesecake Pan Needs Some Tweaking,"This is ""just okay""... I feel that it could be more secure on the bottom. The filling oozes out from the bottom no matter how secure I make it. I bought two and am doubly disappointed."
1,"Rust, Rust, Rust","This product rusted after one use. I hand washed the small disk, placed them on a cotton towel to air dry, the next day all of them had rusted. Very disappointing."
1,Finish is pealing,I bought 3 of these to make cheesecakes for a wedding. I used them 3 times and they are pealing. Don't want to use them for fear they will shed onto food.
2,"Nice Contruction, Poor Coating","I was super impressed with this pan for the first 3 uses, after that the teflon coating started peeling off. I never put these in the dishwasher or anything. While taking cheesecakes out I noticed the teflon sticking to the cakes. While rinsing them out, even more teflon came off!No more non-stick for this baker. I've only had this pan for one month. Hopefully I can return this."
5,Easy to use and clean,"I am thoroughly enjoying the mini cheesecake pan. In addition to cheesecakes, I have used it to make cold pressed appetizers, such as mini avocado and salmon towers. Would definitely recommend it."
5,Good gift,Purchased this pan for my mother-in-law for Christmas. As far as I can tell she was excited to receive it.
5,"little cakes, big hit","I had purchased one of these pans, and quickly decided that one was not enough. I have worked with my regular cheesecake recipes to adapt them to the special pan, and given the long baking and cooling times, three work better! The little cakes are always a hit based on their looks alone, and everyone enjoys being able to try different flavors without having a whole piece from a larger cheesecake. The pan itself is very durable and cleans up like a dream."
5,Mini Cheescake pan,"I am always the one who brings desserts to family functions, these are great! They make the perfect 2-3 bite size. The cheesecakes I made came right out, no oiling/greasing necessary. I bought 2 pans and am glad I did, 24 at a time is about 1 cheesecake recipe."
5,Fantastic mini cheesecake pan,"I love cheesecake but it has so many calories! I purchased this product to make small cheesecakes that wouldn't ruin my calorie count for the day, but would satisfy my sweet tooth. I also figured, that for Thanksgiving, an assortment of mini desserts would be nice. Everyone would get to try all of the desserts without overdoing it. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend purchasing this pan. I would recommend sitting the pan on a cookie sheet when baking since some of the butter in the crust can leak through -- that's not a problem, it does the same thing if you are making a big cheesecake in a spring form pan."
4,not staisfied,"the tray was missing one of the removable bottoms I was shocked that is so disappointing I and i didn't know what to do and there wasn't any number provided for such a thinghow ever, the product itself is very good and i really like it"
5,Cook like a Pro!!!,"I made German Chocolate Cheesecakes in my new pans. They came out so impressive. If you really want to impress your guests, make your individual cheesecakes and decorate your dessert plates with swirls of a great sauce and place the cheesecake in the middle. They will never believe you made them yourself."
1,Do not buy,"From the start this pan started to peel its coating. After a few uses, it became unusable because of the constant shedding of the coating. I was very disappointed with this item. Subsequently, I purchased a different mini cheesecake pan without coating and it works very well."
2,Too many defective pans in stock,"I bought the Norpro mini cheese cake pans. Each time I had issues. 1st pan came from ""Potential Dynamix"". Discs were missing. Amazon refunded. I repurchased. 2nd one arrived from A & L Inter. Pan cups were rust, but Amazon exchanged. 3rd one came yesterday from the same seller (A & L Inter). The surface of the pans including the cups were very very rough with many small air bubbles. I don't want to have to go through this again, so I'll keep it. I probably wouldn't use it. What a waste of my time and money."
5,cheesecake mini pan,I love to bake and always look for good quality pans! I was very happy with the Mini Cheesecake pans! Well worth the money!!
4,Look so cute when finished!,"I purchased two of these pans and for the most part love them. I found it a little tricky to pinpoint the temperature and time to bake them bc mine didnt have any instructions in the box. The finished product looks amazing, just takes some time and patience."
2,MADE IN CHINA CRAP!,"I was thinking which pan to get between the chicago metallic and this norpro brand. Because of all the glowing reviews and the cute cheesecakes photos that bakers are posted that I decided to went ahead to purchased this pan. I was very excited that it came 2 days before thanksgiving and so I thought I am now ready to make my mini cheesecakes. I opened the box and checked the pan and it's round pieces that goes at the bottom, oh my gosh! the coating of the round pieces is flaking off and I notice that each cavity of the pan don't have a smooth finish. It's bubbled up and the pan is made of thin metal. I mean it is not heavy at all. The workmanship and quality of this pan is poor and cheaply made. I was totally disappointed and with it's price you expect a high quality well made pan but no, you will be getting a piece of crap that is made in CHINA. Well, sorry AMAZON but this pan has to go."
1,Disappointed,I operate a small cake and pasty business and was excited to purchase these pans however one pan came with only seven removable bottoms
4,very good,"good not only for cheesecake, but for other desserts. I'm recommending to my students, because I teach baking, cake decoration and pastry.I"
4,Good Juice delivered no gogo,"Quikrete 1905-17 Gal Therm-Lube Admixture is good juice, but the delivery sucked. It took them five ""(5)"" weeks to deliver this product. Do you think they would give me a discount heck no. I got it good and didn't even get a kiss! Don't do it people run away very fast get it from someplace else!"
3,Sterling Silver Round Clear C/Z Initial S Charm,"I received my charm in a timely manner, and it appeared just as it did in the picture. However, once I got it, it was smaller than I had anticipated. Would have liked it, a little bigger. Thought about ordering others for X-mas gifts, but need to find one that is slightly bigger"
5,Solid debut for Sam Wiggle,"Greg Page was always going to be hard to replace -- his voice is remarkably pleasant and he had a winning way about him -- but Sam Moran surprises in his first video outing. His voice is different from Greg's, but very fine -- in some ways, more polished. He also has an amiable manner, and immediately won over my two-year-old daughter. Judging by her chatter, Sam rivals Murray for the title of her favorite Wiggle character. I agree with the comment that the digital backgrounds are a drawback, but as the digital work goes in these kinds of videos, what we see here isn't bad."
3,Too Boring for younger viewers,"We were so excited to see the first DVD with Sam featured. It is educational but too boring for younger viewers. My son is 2 and loved Wiggling around the Clock, Sailing, and Toot Toot probably because they have so much singing. Getting Strong is a lot of talking. It reminds me of Sesame Street and would probably be most appropriate for 4 yrs. and older. The DVD is well done- nice costumes and backgrounds. Has some favorite Wiggly Dancers and many new dancers, band players, and children."
3,Is this boring or simply not as addictive?,"Comparing their previous work with Getting Strong, I'd take Getting Strong over the now stale show tune format. We finally see the fruits of their labor as child educators. It's true that my 14mo daughter is not as mesmerized with this one, but the older ones help us out while she's doing physical therapy. This is perfect for my 3yo. I applaud the new format because there's so much worthless entertainment on the tv these days which doesn't promote healthy living or school readiness for young children. I can't wait for the next installment: while I'm waiting, I can still hum those old, annoyingly addictive songs in my head while the family plays ""Blow Me Down."""
1,yuch,Terrible!Songs are boring.Definitely not one of their better ones for sure.My son loves them but gets nothing out of thid DVD.Sorry guys.
2,Way over a little ones head...*snore*!,"I am a recent wiggly fanatic...well, at least my 16 month old daughter is. She loves to jump and dance and sing with the wiggles, but this DVD held her attention for exactly 30 seconds. It is way too old for their normal target audience. I didn't really like the backgrounds too much either, digital everything just looks corny to me. This is a great addition for the older child who needs to learn these things before pre-school, but for iddy biddy's it's best to pop in the big red car again."
2,Big disappointment,"The Wiggles new format (whether intended for TV or DVD)lacks the wonderful songs, dances, energy, and sweet goofiness that so endear them to children and adults alike. The ""learning"" skits are weak and repetitive, almost condescending even for an audience of two-year-olds. And Anthony, increasingly hyperactive, fairly leaps off the screen.Wiggles--please, go back to what you do best! The two stars are for Sam Moran, who has a beautiful voice and charming manner and is a worthy successor to Greg Page."
1,A complete DUD,"This is by far the worst Wiggles DVD. The songs are not interesting, not catchy and the entire DVD is by far the most boring Wiggles DVD in our collection. The songs also sound poorly recorded, the vocals are way in the background, arrangements are bad, not many wiggly dancers, this DVD completely is a waste of money. Pick up Top of the Tots (2004) and you'll see a big difference in the production/recording, and well thought out music. I hope they are not this bad in concert."
3,Good Video,We have over 10 videos. This one gets a B in my book. My 2 years olds are just starting to dance and move to it. I think they will like it more when they get older.
2,Not as good or entertaining as others,"My 18 month old loves the Wiggles, but this DVD is very slow and boring. The songs are slow and the action is not very action oriented. I realize they were going for a learning bit this time, but I still think they missed the mark with this DVD."
4,Read this book!,"Katherine NaulaMay 28,2003EverywhereBy: Bruce Brooks.Bruce Brooks choose the setting for the book every where in the capital of Virginia, which is Richmond. They lived in a small house where the boy's life was pretty sad, because at the beginning some thing bad happens to the boy's grandfather and that attaches with the theme that is love between the boy and this grandfather. After Dooley and the boy (which they never tell his name) have to find a turtle, Dooley remembers seeing in a comic book about saving lives. If Dooley gets a turtle and he puts something on that his grandfather loves his grandfather will get better. His grandfather loves bowties so they have to put a bowtie on the turtle. As in the book ""trade off the animal for the person"" They had to also fix something that was broken. Dooley, grandfather, and the boy were the main characters. Read the book to find out if his grandfather gets better and what they have to fix!!!"
5,AMAZING....,This is the most relaxing CD I have ever listened to. I have it playing ALL NIGHT long every night for the most restful nights you could ever imagine.
5,Other ways to obtain this title,"If Culture and Social Theory becomes unavailable... for any reason, it can also be obtained from the publisher, Transaction, or, in Europe, from the distributor, Eurospan Ltd."
2,"Something of a yawner, unless you like Apollo","Let's face it, the character of Apollo, as written, is too stilted and goody-goody to be of much interest to the general public. This episode doesn't help matters much, placing Apollo (conveniently out of fuel, with no wingmates, tracking, or support vessels) on a planet run by a third-rate slimebag and a malfunctioning Cylon. Naturally, a somewhat useless female and her son need Apollo to defend them. This entire episode is basically a vehicle to show what a nice guy Apollo is, a point that needs no further pounding into BG fans' skulls. ""Inept"" is the operative word here."
4,Expensive and I can't tell the difference,"I had been using Techwax 2.0 at $10 per can. This stuff smells nicer but doesn't shine the cars any better. I suspect most of the raves come from those who didn't prep first before but preped when they used this stuff. If you wax your car twice a year most any good wax will work well, at least here in Southern California. One thing I did notice was that the car was much smoother and showed more depth where I preped it with the Zymol prep first. But where I just waxed as I have always done, I couldn't tell the difference in shine, gloss or anything else, at least visually. I don't know about protection either but it seems to me when the gravel falls off the truck ahead of you on the freeway no wax will stop the paint from chipping or window from breaking. My cars are dark metalliac red and Mitsubishi Ivory white. The paint is in good shape because I wax every 4 to 6 months."
5,Everything in its shadow,"The problem with the first major book on a cuisine being the best is everyone writing books afterward feels they have to change things, usually for the worse.For instance, if I were to write a Moroccan cookbook today, the best I could do is one line, directing the reader to buy this book instead.Otherwise, I would have to try to simplify recipes to their detriment, clutter them up with disastrous result, or scrape the bottom of the barrel for more original recipes that aren't particularly good.So even though this book has few illustrations and was written in the 70's, if you actually want to cook Moroccan food you really don't have any choice. You simply must buy this book and cook through it because every other author on the subject has done the same and cowers in the shadow of this achievement."
3,"It's OK, but old and NO PICTURES","It's time to update this book with pictures and recipes that call for less than 4 chickens. Really!! Many recipes are designed to feed a crowd. It would be a lot easier to scale up a recipe (X2, or X4) than to scale down a recipe.If I were doing it again, I'd get a different book.Ooops! I guess you're not supposed to criticize Wolfert. I say, ""The book is living on reputation."" It's time to update it."
2,Overcomplicated recipes,"I never use this book because it contains unnecessarily complicated recipes. I am not looking for recipes adapted to mainstream American tastes and am happy to seek out and use exotic ingredients, but these recipes are just not remotely practical and I wind up searching for tagine recipes elsewhere. Maybe an update would be in order, especially as the author seems to have the resources for a broad scope of Moroccan recipes. However, there do seem to be multiple other cookbooks on the subject that are simpler to use."
1,Not a cookbook........,"This is a lot of things, but it is not a cookbook. The recipes are listed by local names and have little or any organization. I felt like I spent more time looking up what the words meant so often that I felt the book was written in Moroccan. There were a very few line drawings and no pictures of finished dishes. This book is not about couscous, it is about just about every other dish served in Morocco.My daughter loves couscous and I bought this book hoping to find some good dishes that she would enjoy. Nothing could be further from the truth.If you are looking of a compendium of Moroccan food and have time to sit and read this book from cover to cover, then this is your book. If you want something helpful in the kitchen, save you money.This book was a total disappointment to me and I am amazed that it is even given cookbook status."
1,A big fiasco,"I bought this book with great expectations based on previous reviews available at amazon.com. The book seemed to ambition a blend of North african anthropology, personal memories and actual recipes. But the final product is a complete fiasco from each of the three points of view. Author seems to be more interested to impress readers with her hypothetical knowledge of international and Moroccan cousine than to actually encourage the practice of the various recipes. Some descriptions (for example preparation of the ""warka"") are pompous if not ludicrous and I doubt that anyone will use them. Neverending discussions on the many types of olives and their similarities with non-Moroccan counterparts are again a complete waste of time to read. In summary: a bad cookbook."
4,A very good guide to Moroccan food!,"When we got this book, my husband looked through every page from cover to cover with excitement. He took a pencil and circled all of the recipes that he loved, or sounded good to him. He circled a large portion of the book!! I have grown to love Moroccan food since I got married, and more so since our trip to Morocco! The only down side is that there isn't that large of variety of recipes. I am searching for more variety, since my husband only wants a certain few moroccan meals. I will never get rid of this book! I love it, and it makes a great foundation for your Moroccan cooking library!"
5,"Delicious, Exotic, and Authentic","Having lived in Morocco for 2 yrs, being an amateur but avid cook, and having learned quite a few recipes from my Moroccan hubby's mother and grandmother, I think the recipes in this book are wonderful and it is an interesting read as well. The recipes have been modified for modern/western kitchens and most of the recipes use significantly less oil than traditional Moroccan cooking, but the dishes taste just as good.I recommend you try the cinammon-almond crusted baked fish, its a favorite of my American and Moroccan friends alike. The orange and grated carrot salad is very refershing and is a nice twist on a potluck contribution such as coleslaw. Add a few pomegranate seeds on top for a nice finishing touch."
4,Moroccan Wife...,I have enjoyed this cookbook very much. My Moroccan husband has liked everything I have cooked using the receipes from this book. I only rated it a 4 because some of the instructions are not clear. I would love it if the author would update it.
3,Another wife of a Moroccan living in Morocco,If it was still the 70's I would rate this book 5 stars. I just wish Ms. Wolfert would update this book!!!!So many of the recipes are more complicated then they need to be nowdays. So many shortcuts are available today in the U.S. and in Morocco. Many of the substitutes she recommends also no longer need to be substituted as you can find the original ones in any arab food market and some even in your local food mart.With my own little adjustments made to the recipes (for convenience sake) I would recommend this book....just ignore the stories she writes about Moroccans (it isn't the 70's anymore!).
4,Romantic Book:A Bicycle Built For Two,"Alice Duncan is an excellent author. She composed the Meet Me at the Fair series and A Bicycle Built for Two is the third book in this series. I like Alice Duncan's books because her writing is suspenseful, which makes you want to finish the book without stopping. I like trying to predict what will happen next. However Alice Duncan's stories are unpredictable with many surprises.A Bicycle Built for Two is a third person story about a young woman, Kate, who tries to care for her ill mother and keep her jobs despite the threats of her abusive father and opposition of her superior.I would recommend A Bicycle Built for Two for people who read at least at the 6th grade level. There are some difficult words that are understood when taken in context. The dictionary is useful for understanding the story.If you like books about people in challenging life-like situations with surprise endings, then this absorbing book is for you!"
5,Excellent dog collar -- no regrets,"We've had this collar a little over a month, and we're still very happy with it. We needed a new collar for our large puppy (8 months, 65 lbs, Doberman/Am. Bulldog mix) because he'd outgrown his first collar but his neck wasn't quite big enough for the ""big boy"" collar that my husband bought at the pet store.The reflective collar is great for the nightly walks that my husband takes him on, and the reflective coating on the collar is still in good shape."
2,Dog collar,"The dog collar is great for helping my black lab stand out at night. But after only 2 months he has already scratched off most of the reflective material, now the collar is really ugly and does not reflect anymore."
1,Cheaper Collar sent,"Ordered this collar and was sent a 30"" Orange Sunglow Dog collar that cost 5.79 according to the invoice. This collar was sent from a different company and when I called to explain that the wrong collar was sent and not the Remington that I had ordered they said they dont carry the Remington Brand and I asked how could that be. They said that they were a 3rd party and that Petscity asked them to send the collar for them and to send something close to the Remington collar...I called PetsCity and it was a waste of time so I talked With AMAZON and they will take care of the problem......"
1,not good business practice,"The seller did not fulfill the order correctly. The collars are supposed to be reflective and of a cloth stitched type. I have been using the correct type for years so I should know. These were plastic, non-reflective and had a big metal O-ring on them. I feel they knew they sent the incorrect ones and I should not have to eat shipping costs to or from doesn't everyone agree? Maybe new policies should be in order."
2,didn't receive everything described,"The product description says that this includes tested recipes and decoration instructions, but all i received was the hello kitty bubble blower and the 4 rings. My daughters birthday is next week, so I guess I will have to design my own cake. I could have just bought the rings for cheaper price."
5,A CD to empower your day,"Techno-trance fans and ravers, this CD is definitely worth bying. It's for those who have trance music as an inside rhythm."
3,"Nice book, Not my cup of tea",I bought this book for a class taught by the author. The book had some interesting stories in it. I wouldn't say that reading it was a waste of my time though I do not plan on reading it again.
1,Environmental Health...sans Science,"I should not write the following, as I want to sell my copy, but here it goes: this book is, seemingly, written for a general ""non-science"" audience, or for (early) high school students. CERTAINLY, it is not appropriate for a university course. It is overtly simplified and unlike many books written for a general audience (i.e., science journalism), the prose in the book is horribly dull. EXTREMELY limited for a college public health course."
5,Great for Teachers!,"I purchased this book for my sister who teaches drama to teenagers. She loves this work. It's funny, touching and speaks directly to the kids. I would recommend Dabrowski's books to anyone who wants to introduce quality material to young performers."
1,"Not particularly stageable, not particularly interesting.","I purchased this with two other collections of short plays for teens to use with the high school drama club I run. I was rather disappointed with the characterizations and some of the very large cast sizes for very short plays. The students (urban high school) I work with and I found the characters to be rather flat caricatures of teenage angst rather than deeper characters that my students have become interested in portraying. The one gem I found here was 'The Ten Minute High School Experience,' which takes a modern stripped down approach to theatre and puts experimental theatre into a lens that my students can understand. I wish more of the writing, characterization and dialogue had been like it."
2,Huge Disappointment,"I've been a big fan of both Johnny Almond and Jon Mark since their days in John Mayall's group touring the US. The first three albums of their efforts after the Mayall era have been great - musically, lyrically and vocally. I loved every single song from those albums. I have waited eagerly for each album to be released and I have never had enough of their music.Unfortunally, this 'comeback' of theirs is below any criticism I could muster. It is boring and kitschy. I still listen to their old music, but this album is something to be avoided in the name of love for the old Mark Almond.2 stars - only for the sake of memories, but actually, this album does not deserve more than 1 star."
1,This CD made me want to vomit...I threw it in the trash.,"I'm a huge jazz fan, and I was expecting something of the sort when I purchased ""NightMusic"". The cover to this album is misleading. What you get is some pretty nauseating elevator music that is bland and corny. Please spare yourself the misery and skip this album."
1,HORRENDOUS,"Listening to this album was a painful experience. How to describe it? Let's see: CORNY, CHEESY, DULL. You want smooth jazz? Pick up a Todd Cochran or Antonio Carlos Jobim album."
5,Love this Perfume,"I am definitely in love with this scent.. Unfortunately I can't ever seem to find it! It is a pretty strong scent, but I loove it! I always get compliments. The seller was prompt! If you like a strong but sensual scent, I highly recommend it :)"
5,Smells Great,"I was buying my husband some Nautica and figured I would try some out for myself. It has a nice clean, fresh scent to it. Awesome."
3,GCC Student,The book was good once we applied the errata from the instructor's web site. He also handed out revised chapters in class. First book I have seen that offers any mention of initialization lists for constructors. I liked the standards recommended and the Hungarian Notation since I want to be a Microsoft Windows programmer.
4,Great tape!,The quality was great although I thought it was supposed to be a DVD. Great hints and tips for players. If you like the Hulls it's a great VHS.
2,good for children.,"I strongly recommend you get Sean Skinner's dvd series Stickhandling Beyond Belief. While it is not dealing with scoring, Skinner's dvd will do a lot more for a player of any skill level than this short dvd. This is mainly for brute beginners and children."
3,Beware - Recordings are from 1940's or earlier,"If you are into Kubelik's orchestral interpretations over the years, this may be of interest, but note the sound does in fact sound like old 78 rpm quality; in fact I probably have old 78's that sound better. I was hoping that this CD was a reissue of a Deutsche Grammaphone LP that I have, but missed the small print before purchasing, that said these were ""historical performances"" that dated (I think) 1946 and earlier. The performance of The Moldau is a little too relaxed for my taste. I prefer a brisker tempo such as is found in the Ma Vlast performance by Zubin Mehta & the Israel Philharmonic on CD, which I'd recommend."
2,Old Stock? Used to be a great product.,"Used this product many times before with great results, however I bought two of these as haven't been able to find it lately but it seemed to be very old stock, didn't even smell the same and had the consistency of PVA glue - ended up throwing both tubes out. Very disappointing."
1,Disappointing,"Do not waste your money on this one. Very poor research and slow moving. This si not the first time I have been disappointed with this author, but it will be the last time and of this I am sure. I think this book was probably written in about 2 days. This is one of the worst books I have read in along time. I can not understand how this Turkey ever got published. AWFUL!!!!!"
2,Too much legal stuff,"True crime is tough to write about, but filling page after page after page ... with complicated legal wranglings and accounting practices that no one but an accountant could understand or even care about takes this book from about 10 pages of interesting information about the lives of these people to however many it ended up being. Sorry, I ramble."
1,Drudgery,"Working at this book was sheer drudgery. I'm a quick reader, and I love true crime, so taking two weeks to plow through the first half of the book was most unusual. Most frustrating, too. Finally, I gave up, checked the back of the book for the verdict (normally verboten) and just threw it away. The author built an air castle on conjecture. ""If"", ""maybe"", ""perhaps"", ""possibly"", are the main words. There's hardly a sentence without one of these, and a notable scarcity of facts and evidence. It was a big waste of money and time, and I'm going to be pretty allergic to the name Carlton Smith from now on! (Too bad he shares a first name with another true crime author who's consistently good!) Yuk."
1,Boring!!!!,I have never been thrilled with Carlton Smith's work but after trying the sample on the Kindle I decided to give him another try. I bought the book based on the first chapter which was the only part of the book actually written like a story. I agree with the other reviews that none of the karma stuff or history on culture was necessary. My biggest problem with the book is that most of it was word for word from trial transcript. If that's what I wanted to read I would buy a copy of the transcript. Carlton Smith needs to read authors like Ann Rule to see how to write a book that tells a good story and skips all the repeating trial testimony. I will never purchase another one of his books again. I didn't want to give it any stars but had to give one to continue with this review.
2,only a ballast was shipped to me,i was under the understanding I would get the full lighting system but I only got a ballast in the mail and had to spend another 40 dollars for the rest of the set up. I do like the quality of sun systems products
3,"Great doll, but a few negative comments must be made.","This QUI-Gon Jinn doll is a nice well-made action fiure.Hair feels and looks real to.But the lightsaber does not fit well in the hand.Once I figured out it was taped, and held in place with rubberbands, I was kind of disappointed.So now, whenever I want him to hold the saber, I have to hold the fingers in place.I think the Count Dooku Epasode Two doll I just got is better because the fingers close about the handel.Are there any other Star Wars dolls that can hold the lightsabers well without the need for taping/rubberbanding the lightsaber handel in the fingers?So far I only own two.Was considering maybe a Mace Windu if any can still be found that hold the saber well, or perhaps an Obi Wan or Anikan Skywalker doll or something similar.Ideas are appreciated. Other than that, I'd recommend the character. The wide mouthed ssmile witht eeth exposed is kind of odd though."
4,Leather Bridle,"For under 30$ I think this bridle is pretty nice. I would not pay much more for it. The leather is fairly thin and the black color looks more like dark brown. The headstall comes with nice laced reins, a good value. This bridle in full size fits my gypsy cob with a little room to spare. (He takes a large horse size halter and just grew out of an average size.) There are plenty of holes to adjust it smaller as well. Overall, I can tell from feel of the leather that this is not an expensive bridle but for this price I don't mind. It will work fine for everyday."
5,My Iguana Loves This Stuff!,"Great product! My iguana was egg bound and didn't like any of the other nesting materials we gave her. However, she seems to love this. She is in her 'nest' all the time now. Plus, the price was reasonable. Good buy overall."
5,"Wonderful, amazing music.","Really relaxing music, perfect for background sound in a group setting. I listen to it on a daily basis and I can't get enough of it. I bought the CD after listening to the demo, instantly I was hooked. Give the samples a listen to see if it's right for you."
1,Yeccch!! --not the real Roller Derby at all!,"Only a portion of this ""documentary"" deals with Roller Derby in its beginnings. At a certain point the whole video shifts to the ""Roller Games"" which was nothing but a sideshow with some good skaters. No mention of the real Roller Derby is made again. Don't bother. Instead try to find ""Derby""--a real documentary about the real thing on vhs, the books ""Five Strides on the Banked Track"" and ""Roller Derby to RollerJam"" tell the whole story."
5,And Gladly Teach,"Professor Showalter's book about the teaching of literature is the most honest, realistic, directly applicable work in the field. Avoiding the jargantuan language of the educational establishment, she has put together a most readable work that should aid the beginning instructor as well as the most experienced. Her mind is open to a wide range of pegagogical techniques, recognizing the need for flexible and pragmatic solutions to a highly complex activity. While it is aimed at teachers of literature much of it applies to all areas and levels of teaching. Her background of experience and the range of her interests make the advice she gives credible. I only wish I had been able to read such a work when I began teaching over fifty years ago."
3,A bit disappointing,"I purchased this book hoping to get more practical, concrete advice about how to plan for and teach my literature classes. While Showalter's book does contain some useful ideas, most of those ideas exist at the abstract level.For example, in the sub-section on leading discussion, Showalter lists the types of questions that an instructor generally wants to ask during a discussion. Instead of explaining each of the types, however, Showalter just lists them and mentions the book that they were taken from. The reader of Showalter's book would thus need to track down the original book that she got her ideas from.Overall, this book does have some good ideas and it's always nice to know that other professors experience the same types of worries and fears at the start of each new semester. As far as as concrete advice goes, however, I felt like this book was lacking."
2,"Decent, but there are better ones",I found this particular title to be of interest. But some what disjointed. I only retained it because it's a title that is getting hard to find.
4,"Wonderful Work, small photos","Have been to numerous lectures given by the couple architects. Very creative structural design for one thing. Beauty at where they arrive between what's progressive & what was and is indigenous. Amazing models made after projects being built for furthur analysis. Too bad the photos are small and not in color. Light & shadow & materials can say a lot about a building & color photos would be very helpful for their next book. Still a must have, professional and all alike."
4,So versatile,Giorgia is one of the most versatile singers on the scene. What a voice! I think she can sing anything!!
4,Having fun!,"I am having a lot of fun with 40 winks. If you liked spyro the dragon, you will definetly like 40 winks."
3,An avarege Game,"This game has a great storyline considering that you stil belive in Santa. The gmeplay is okay at best. I have this game and have tried to escape the first level but fail to get to the last ""wink"" and then escape with him. If you like a challenging childrens game, then by all means purchase it. This game is not on my top five games I have ever played."
2,"Difficult, need guide book.","I bought this game for my daughter and she get's very frustrated with this game! It is difficult for a child to figure out what to do next. I wish we had a guide book/hint book for this game as it would make it a lot easier during those very (and I do mean very) frustating times!If you have patience to try and figure this one out then go for it, but in all honesty I would not recommend purchasing this item, not even at a fantastic deal. Unless, of course, someone gives it to you for free."
2,makes me nauseous,I was really looking forward to this game because I loved Crash and Spyro so much. I think this could be a good game but it is hard to control. The view is not consistent and it makes me nauseous. As you move around it doesn't always pan with you. It is rather annoying to have to adjust the view manually. I got half way through the first level and had to stop because it gave me such a headache. I really want to play this but I don't want to feel sick every time. Too bad :-(
2,Not what I expected,"Most of this video is breathing exercises that are too intense for me. I felt like I was going to hyperventilate. There are only a few parts that I was able to do and they did feel relaxing, but having to skip through most of it makes the purchase not worth it."
1,NOT for beginners,"This is my 3rd review, I deleted my first 2 because people kept finding them not helpful due to the fact they were negative. If you search the negative reviews on this product you will find a similar story with all of them. This DVD is very strange and off putting. The girl in video even spends a few minutes panting like a dog. I wish I could say I was joking but I am not. I gave this to 2 different friends who also felt it was very strange. I read the positive reviews on this and good rating and it was my 1st experience with any yoga. After watching this I assumed yoga was not my thing and didn't try it again for 2+ more years. Boy was I wrong, this DVD almost ruined yoga for me forever. I tried a regular mainstream yoga class recently and I LOVE it! I can't stress enough to do some extra research on this before wasting your money and hating yoga like I did. And I'm sure I will have 20 not helpful votes by the time I come back to check this one too!!!!"
3,Many pauses throughout,It is really long and doesn't flow well. It is broken up between every yoga movement and she spends quite a bit of time on every movement. I would have liked one that is more dance-like going from pose to pose without any pause between. She does a good job explaining the poses and is very thorough though.
1,"Tough to get through, but not because of the work out","It must be me, but I have a hard time with the whole set-up of this workout - from Ana's strange work-out wear, to her girly ponytails, to the panting - it all just seems sexualized and not something that I am looking for in a yoga routine. I have taken a lot of yoga classes and this was just too bizarre for me to get through. It had such great reviews, I was really hoping to love it, but alas, I did not..."
3,Eh,This dvd is sure to be great for someone just not me. I am new to Kundalini Yoga so it was quite an experience to say the least. I bought the dvd a month ago and have only used it 3 times. I need to check the return policy matter of fact. Just not my thing.
1,This is not Yoga! Nor an exercise!,"I started watching the video hoping to exercise with it. Guess what? It was not even close to what I expected. From the beginning the girl started to disgust me!!! Weird and boring positions. Not many creative moves and she repeats everything for a long period of time. What a waste of money. To be honest, since I couldn't return it, I threw it out in the garbage. I just can't believe that people found this beneficial. It was awful!!"
1,Repetitious and Boring,"It's not yoga - it's hyperventilation combined with a repetitious single movement. For example, sit with your arms straight out, looking over the left hand, inhale. Now curl the hands in to touch your shoulders, exhale and whip your head to the right. Now left and inhale, right and exhale....and repeat for 5 minutes. There, I've saved you the price of the DVD. It's by far the worst yoga DVD I've ever purchased."
1,This Is Yoga??????,"I am very disappointed in this video. It should not even have the word ""yoga"" in it. The ridiculous 'herky-jerky' movements and animated breathing patterns leave one wondering what is the purposeof the video. Weight loss? I think not.If you enjoy non-melodic music, an instructor that sports a constant smirk on her face and a droning, monotone background voiceattempting to verbally instruct you, then this is the video for you!"
1,Other reviews are misleading,"While the dvd may be good for some, there have to be those who don't like it. A dvd rating is then basically rating what PERCENTAGE of people will like it- 3.5 stars? 70% of people will like it...somewhat. This is how I view it. [...]I don't like this dvd, and I would not suggest it. End of story [...]."
1,Fat Free Worth Free,Yoga means exercise to me! Special ways of moving air in and out of my body is not exercise. Maybe the producers think we will all be doing Lamaze childbirth breathing soon and need practice. Total waste of time and money--- that is my opinion of this DVD.
3,not what I expected,"This is an interesting yoga video but not what I had hoped for. The DVD has a special matrix feature which allows you to customize your workout, a definite positive. However, I think there is not a lot of direction or description about the organization and what is each chapter's purpose. Since the video is 90 minutes, it is not likely to be done in its entirety, so it would be helpful to categorize the sections so one can create an effective yoga workout with the necessary components and organization. Also, I read on other reviews about little or no instruction on the ""breath of fire"": I agree, you will figure it out but if you don't select the chapter which introduces this to you, you will be confused on some other chapters. This yoga workout feels mostly like a warmup to me, and there wasn't enough emphasis on flexability."
5,Refreshingly Different!,"i recently bought Ana & Ravis fat free DVD series. i love them! i've done some Rodney Yee yoga before, and this is a refreshing change. i've never seen yoga done like this before. and the instructions are very clear."
4,It's Good - I Like it!,"I'm new to Kundalini Yoga and this is my first video purchase for Yoga in this style. I generally practice Kripalu Yoga and some Power Yoga (Baron Baptiste) now and again, too. This is definitely different, but I really like it. Ravi's voice is very soothing and if I get a body like Ana's from practicing Kundalini, then I'm quite happy! All in all, a good video. Energetic, yet soothing and the breath work is really fun!"
3,"Good, but not very challenging","I had received this DVD yesterday and tried it out just today. I ended up going through the whole thing in one go and my honest opinion is that I wish it had been a bit more challenging. I think this workout is great for those just beginning yoga, or who are just getting into exercising. Don't get me wrong, the routines made me sweat! But I just didn't feel it was challenging enough to be fun and interesting and very useful. I do not think I will be using this routine again and will try to opt for a bit more of a challenge next time. I also want to add, though, that this was very wonderfully designed. I love the voice over and the way Ana Brett demonstrated the moves. I also loved how every workout was always followed by a meditation. I thought that was a great juxtaposition. I would definitely recommend this workout to beginners, but perhaps for more advanced practitioners of yoga and exercising, another dvd may work better."
4,Fat Free Yoga,"I had never done yoga before and have been having back issues for 4 months. After a doctor recommended yoga for back strengthening, I ordered this DVD. I feel stronger already (after 3 weeks doing 20-30 minutes a day) and my chiropractor made NO ADJUSTMENTS on my last visit. You feel the muscles working but it is not too difficult. I think my stomach has gotten a tad flatter too!"
5,LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!,"I have several of Ravi Singh & Ana Brett's DVD's. I love them all, but this one is my favorite. It's new to my collection, and I enjoy it daily. From the movements, to the breath of fire and meditation, I feel and notice my body changing. I recommend it for newbies who are interested in starting the KY practice. Actually, I recommend all their DVD's. Their passionate about their practice, their knowledgeable and they will not disappoint. This DVD includes four 20 minutes segments, along with a meditation. I love this DVD, and I know you'll love it too."
5,Refreshing exercise,"I love yoga and I love cardio. Although don't expect a sweat from this video, you can expect to have a clear head and a feeling of being refreshed. You do some total body movements which is very important. The breath of fire is amazing. I purchased this video to help me lower my blood pressure. I am noticing that my breathing is more normal and I am not feeling that sense of anxiety that I sometimes experience. I was pleasantly surprised because I am new to Kundalini yoga. I am planning to add more."
4,Tough but enjoyable,"It's a tough workout, especially when you first begin. But it helps you sweat and you feel like you've done a lot after. Not bad."
2,you can really hurt yourself,"I read many reviews of this dvd before I bought it and I have been doing yoga in one form or another for over 30 years. This was the first time that I truly hurt myself doing yoga - I didn't even think it was possible. In yoga, if you are feeling pain, you back off and only go to the point of sweet discomfort and your body learns from there. When I did this dvd, the first time was okay but after that, I found I was in pain. There are too many repetitive and sharp movements - particularly with the neck and you might not feel that immediately, but you will later. I do not use this dvd any longer."
2,Weird,"I am sure it may be a good work out, but I couldn't get past how weird the instructors were. I bought the video because of all the fantastic reviews, but the instructor is just a tad too odd for me and it is weird that while she is doing the exercises a loud deep mans voice is narrating. It was a bit odd for me and I guess I will just stick with the 10 minute solution videos."
4,Funny,"I find this yoga video a little silly. Ana Brett is a little goofy for my taste but overall the yoga is fun and easy to do. It also encourages a positive way of looking at your body and your situation, which I find helpful and pleasant. I enjoy it."
1,Do you like kooky stuff?,"Well good to see Amazon is finally publishing negative reviews on this DVD. This is my third time posting - the other two times my 1 star review did not show - my message is to be suspicious of complete 5 star ratings as its very unlikely 100% of people will like a product.Like others giving it a one star I found it kooky and weird - it did absolutely nothing for me. If you like power yoga and are looking for a change as I was, be careful! I ended up giving mine to a thrift store."
5,Feel Great is the right description!!,I've been doing this workout for about a month now and absolutely love it!! I've recommended it to several of my friends. I've been doing yoga dvds for a while and this is my favorite. The breath of fire was a bit hard to get but now I find myself doing different parts of this during the day to give me energy. Ana and Ravi are great and very supportive and informative through out. It also helps to be able to pick what parts you want to do if you don't have the time to do it all. Fight Fire with Fire is my favorite!! Enjoy and I highly recommend for beginners and moderate yoga enthusists.
5,FAT FREE YOGA,"I like Fat Free Yoga for several reasons , mainly because it is well laid out in sections including meditation , warm-up, aerobic section and postures . Clear instruction is given throughout and isnt distracting .Workouts can be made up according to preference on a given day - the whole dvd is over and hour but can be shortened if necessary . Ana Brett is an inspiration and the routines are enjoyable and relaxing whilst covering all the major areas of the body. A good workout for yoga fans of all levels."
5,Yoga that really delivers!,"I'm so happy I bought this! This is what a weight loss yoga video should be! I don't have much to lose but I like to keep my metabolism humming which this definitely does. It has help for those who suffer from fatigue, low energy, and thyroid imbalance. Kundalini is known for keeping the endocrine system (adrenals, thyroid, pineal, and pituitary glands healthy and functioning smoothly.This is such a great workout done as a whole (there are four 19 minute segments) that I do the whole thing. I like the cardio element, I love the Teapot meditation at the end, and it makes me feel great, gives me energy, confidence, and all the work on my glands keeps me young.This is a great one to begin your Kundalini Yoga practice with. Lots of inspiration. It is very calming. Ana is beautiful in a fresh, natural way, and Ravi's voice is pleasant and calming."
5,Works great for me!,"I have purchased a hand-full of yoga DVDs and this one is my favorite! My goals were to get more slim, strengthen my muscles without building too much muscle mass, and increase flexibility. I am happy to say that I have accomplished all these goals. I actually have become addicted to this DVD and pretty much do the exercises (either all or half) each day. I do skip the chanting meditation parts, though...I just like the workouts and breathing exercises. Some yoga workouts seem too complicated for me at my current level, but I hope to work up to them. This DVD is very much a relaxing workout, not a power workout if that is what you are looking for."
5,Amazing Yoga for Weight Loss & Emotional Boost,"I'm on a permanent high after doing this incredible DVD daily for 3 weeks. I have definitely lost weight and my mental state is noticably improved. This is total mind/body fitness and I'm so happy to have found something which gives me energy, peace, and a better body! It's like a dream! I'm saving up to getting the whole Ana/Ravi collection of DVD's."
5,Made My Belly Fat Disappear!!!,"I'm an avid worker outer, but I had developed a paunch which nothing I tried could get rid of. I wrote to Ravi & Ana and they suggested that I do this DVD at least 3 times a week. They explained that getting rid of belly fat was more than just trying to burn calories. It also involves dealing with stress, emotions, glands, and even proper alignment. Long story short, I started doing this and within 5 weeks I can look in the mirror again without cringing. It worked!!! I'm really thrilled about this. It's magic. Actually, it's science. Whatever it is, it worked! This DVD provides a great workout which you will look forward to doing. It's not so hard that you have to force yourself to do it, but it's not so easy that you long for something more. It's the perfect workout because you look forward to doing it every day. Ravi & Ana are the best yoga teachers out there."
2,.,"This video is okay, but I was looking for something that would be more of a workout. I feel like every time this video is getting close to making me work hard, it has me stop, lay down, meditate...I was pretty bored with it. If you just want something relaxing, I think it would be great. But if you really want to see a change in your body, I'd recommend trying something more up-beat."
4,curious,"I am wondering how this dvd got 5 stars from so many people. It is VERY easy, did not even come close to breaking a sweat, and I am 50 years old and overweight. It is very calming, though, and Ana is beautiful in a clean, natural way, and Ravi's voice is pleasant and calming. However, if this yoga does what it is supposed to, I guess it would be great for your immune system."
5,Love it!,"It's amazing to me that this can and does work. I thought it would be much more difficult. There are brief moments when it is all I can do to keep up, but this feels more like a break in my daily Kundalini DVD rotation.T"
1,Very disapointed,Do not buy it unless you know for sure you'll like it- in other words unless you've seen a clip of it already.I also wrote a review of this over 6 months ago when i bought it- and my review never published.The video is very strange. I did not find it relaxing at all and it made me feel uncomfortable. The woman's outfit was strange and her breathing was too loud and seemed unnatural.Not a good work out.
1,Odd and Different,"I don't get all of the positive feedback. I found this DVD to be strange and not a good workout at all. Ana lays on what looks like a bathmat with her eyes closed and lips pursed doing odd poses and speed breathing. Obviously a lot of people love this workout, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.[...]"
1,Not my style,I'm used to doing Hot Vinyasa yoga and I really couldn't stand this DVD. If it hadn't come in shrink wrap I would have returned it. The breathe of fire made me laugh and I was no where near motivated enough to finish; she sits on a large shag daisy rug (c'mon!). I really couldn't stand it.
5,A Complete Yoga (& Beyond) Workout,"This DVD is an absolute gem! I was looking for something to help me handle stress and keep me in shape and this was the perfect choice. Fat Free Yoga is an active yoga workout which is fitness but it goes deeper than fitness because it works on things like hormonal balance, bodily systems, and improving your mental outlook and making your emotions more positive. When things get overwhelming I know that if I do all or part of this DVD I will feel more expansive and hopeful. I checked this out of my local library about 3 weeks ago and I don't want to give it back! I have lost 4 pounds and I feel energized, relaxed, and happy. I am so grateful to Ana & Ravi for putting out this DVD!"
4,Fat Free Yoga-Lose Weight and Feel Great for Beginners and Beyond w/Ana Brett & Ravi Singh,"After having a back injury related to overuse of weights, I really appreciated this video more than initially! It allowed me to exercise while healing and it gave me the added benefit of managing my stress and anxiety during a tough week leading up to a big event. In the end,the injury gave me a whole week to use this program daily and I really had an opportunity to see how powerful the effects of this program are on physical and mental health. I will now include this as part of my exercise/health routine on a regular basis.I would try some of their other tapes as well. My only ""complaint"" is that Ravi Singh's voice is very soft and I find myself needing to strain to hear him."
3,"ok, but not what I expected","I found this DVD to be surprising but perhaps that is because I am unfamiliar with this style of yoga. It is not 'athletic' in the traditional sense and quite a bit of the exercises are based on breath. I found this to be a challenge as using the 'breath of fire' (quick sniffs in and out of the nose) was something I was completely unfamiliar with. I have been doing the 'fighting fire with fire', 'no impact aerobics' and 'your life is in your glands' sections. These sections made my heart rate increase and warmed me up. The meditations on the DVD are something that I may do before I go to bed, or to relax after a long day. I'm sure that meditation and relaxation can help with weight loss, but I have yet to see results from it. This is a good DVD to do if you are interested in trying something different than what is considered traditional weight loss yoga."
5,It's Amazing and Unexpected but absolutely wonderful!!!,"I'm not the most flexible/bendy person in the world and I'm one of those people who has always thought breathing and meditating etc was a little hoky but I got this dvd and it's amazing. It feels like cardio, it feels like stressing and somehow it manages to be relaxing at the same time. I don't like to exercise but this feels so good and feels so much like you're doing something nice for yourself that you wake up WANTING to do at least a couple of the sections. My favourite parts are the ""Start your engines"", the ""no impact aerobics"" and the ""deep relaxation."" This is an amazing work out and relaxation dvd."
5,Great Work Out!,I am so pleased with my purchase! This video is perfect for a beginner at Yoga like myself. It's not too difficult but you can still 'feel' it when you're done. Very pleased and highly recommend!
1,Useless,"The content is abrupt. Its starts with pose 1, pose 2 and so on. No time is spent on giving an overview or what the various poses are supposed to do.Its a body of work w/o the head.Reminds me of my very first yoga teacher who walked into the class and w/o a word said, ""We will start with the inverted dog position and then move on to the half tree position"". No introduction, no nothing. After 10 minutes of working under blind faith, I did not care if the inverted dog peed on the half tree and walked out of the class."
1,Caused an injury,"This tape was not what I expected. Its a lot of awkward poses and fast breathing, but I didn't even break a sweat. Includes weird chanting too, my husband asked if I had joined a cult. I would not have minded all that if the results had been good. But the result was that I threw my lower back out and was in terrible pain for weeks. It nearly 6 months to heal completely. I'm a pretty fit 40 year old who has done Yoga for a years so I was surprised. My chiropractor said it could have been cause by the quick unguarded motions. I don't think I like Kundalini Yoga. I'm going to stick with regular Yoga. Watch out if you have back issues!"
1,Strange to say the least.,"I read the reviews of this dvd and i thought it could be the perfect dvd for me, I've been practicing yoga for the past 8 months and I'm always looking for something new and challenging now. I happened to read the one star reviews and I searched on youtube for videos before i buy it, I found a couple of videos. After 10 min i quit, I felt silly doing many posses,. Definitely not my type of yoga."
1,Wish I was able to return it,"I don't know how this is fat free yoga. Read all the reviews from other customers and bought it. Highly disappointed and wish I was able to return it, but since I opened it, I have to keep it. I don't know how this is fat free yoga, everything was fast, didn't make sense of it and did not enjoy it at all."
1,"Absolutely boring,","How to say, very boring. Not sure if it even deserves a star. There seemed only a few work-outs on the DVD and it consisted mainly of repeating them ad nauseam. Perhaps being a college athlete this is not for me? When I found this DVD I was excited thinking it was a yoga work-out, instead I wouldn't even use it to warm-up. Seriously, I didn't even break a sweat. All-in-all, I would recommend this to the elderly and go back to my Pilates for Indie Rockers. A work-out that makes the sweat rain."
5,This DVD Rocks...,"This dvd has changed my life. Mentally and physically. Not only have I lost weight but I have a clear mind, and no hot flashes! They have seemed to have disappeared. Love,Love,Love the music, love his voice, and she's a doll. Perfect combo.People can't nit-pick this one. This dvd isn't about being bent up like a pretzel.It's about total well being. Definitely buy this one, you'll feel good!"
5,lose the fat,"Oh my gosh, I ordered this DVD and Ana and Ravi's Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond and have been doing them alternate days for two weeks. I'm so hooked. They give you the most incredible high, make you want to do yoga all day and you notice the differences so quickly.I've been doing yoga and pilates for years and I would never have described yoga as exciting. However, Kundalini yoga is and especially with these two. It's 16 times more powerful than any other yoga. The high will put a grin on your face. My posture is straigher, I've lost kilos, I'm more toned and it's noticeable in stomach, arms, bottom and thighs. I'm giving all my other dvds away because you only need Ana and Ravi's. Happy Kundalining!"
5,Lower Back - Blessed Relief,"After only four times following the DVD two times a week, I have relief from chronic lower back pain. Over a year ago, I injured my lower back with the result being torn muscles and ligaments. Physical therapy helped initially but did not rid me of the constant pain. The exercises I did at physical therapy sometimes made me feel worse. Someone had mentioned to me about doing yoga so I looked it up on amazon.com and found Ravi & Ana's ""Fat Free Yoga"" with many positive reviews. I believe with time, if I do not recover fully, it will be pretty darn close to full recovery! I have yet to lose weight after doing the DVD about six times but do notice my spine/body starting to realign and I ""look"" slimmer and my clothes are fitting better. Ravi and Ana have my eternal gratitude!"
5,GREAT FOR ANY WEIGHT,"I live with a yoga teacher and have a collection of about 50 different videos. This is one of the most played videos I have. I really like all of Ravi and Ana's videos. The videos are easy to follow because Ravi instructs while Ana demonstrates. Like many of Ravi's videos, this video is divided up into 4 seventeen minute sessions(note I have the older video tape version). The video is designed so that people can do any where from 1 to 4 sessions. I like the convenience of being able to do 1 or 2 sessions on mornings when I am in a rush. I find that this tape will energize me for the rest of the day. Each session provides an opportunity to enjoy a total body workout including meditation and breathing."
1,Awful for bike riding,Awful for bike riding. Air flow blows this vest up and around your neck. I wish I had paid more for a zipper vest.
2,One size does not fit all,"I bought this item to replace the one I have. It states one size fits all. I beg to differ. I tried it on, and it looked really small on me. I wear an XL in mens clothing, and this comes know were near that. It barely fit my 12 year old son who wears a medium to large in mens clothing. It is more like a one size fits all for children. The picture does represent the item though and Amazon does ship fast as usual.... hence the two stars."
2,Not What I Expected!,"Compared to other safety vests we have ordered for our company, it was not what I expected.The product was cheaply made and will fall apart if washed. There was not much difference in the price of this safety vest and the vests we usually order, but it was cheap quality."
3,Safety vests,Needed safety vest for one day project. Bought on low end but got what we needed.Good deal as long as folks don't put them on or take them off alot. Get what you pay for.
5,Excellent Product,"This is a great product, well made for the money and one size fits all. Very bright and complies with the latest requirements when working in traffic"
3,"Good deal, but it was negated by the shipping price.","The shipping cost more than the product itself. The item could have easily been shipped in a manila envelope, but it was shipped in a box that was quadruple the size of the item. I was disappointed in the shipping cost."
4,Generally quite good,"I enjoyed this book for the most part and found it largely accurate. There are a few little glitches, however. For example, TR Jr. is NOT, as the book suggests, buried at Sagamore Hill. He is buried at the American Cemetery, Normandy. That being said, Jeffers has generally done a very good job of summing up a fascinating man. For those interested in TR and his children, I'd also recommend Edward Renehan's THE LION'S PRIDE: THEODORE ROOSEVELT AND HIS FAMILY IN PEACE AND WAR, published by Oxford University Press and available through Amazon."
3,Not the Morris/McCullough-quality!,"I enjoyed the book regarding TR Jr.'s time as governor of PuertoRico and the Phillipines and World War I & II because I didn't know much about his life during these periods (except what Ed Renehan and Sylvia Morris wrote in their books). What I did not like about Jeffers' book are a few errors he put in, which could have been avoided by better research: For example, he wrote a few times (like on page 28) that TR (the president)said that he feels ""as fit as a bull moose"" in 1898! As far as I know this expression was coined only in 1912 when a mad man tried to kill TR in Milwaukee. He also writes twice that ""The Roosevelt family of Sagamore Hill"" was written by Mr. Harbaugh (pages 16 and 30). We know that Hermann Hagedorn wrote this great book!It is amazing how many qualities of TR we can find in his oldest son! Jeffers book is a good read, but from my point of view not the great narrative as we know it from Edmund Morris or David McCullough!"
3,"misleading booklet yes, but the music's not that bad","Dear Monica and others, yes, the booklet is horribly misleading. I cannot understand that either the band's or Hugh's management let people get away with this sort of bs.In case you didn't know, Hugh left the band in 1990 already and the others carried on with vocalist Paul Roberts and guitarist John Ellis (ex- The Vibrators, replaced in 2000 by Baz Warne).The live recordings here were made in june 1997 in the Royal Albert Hall when the stranglers celebrated their 25th anniversary. Beautiful arrangements of both classics and newer tracks and fine musicianship by both the band and the accompanying Electra Strings group.The studio recordings were made in the nineties and were originally released on the albums About Time, Written in Red and Coup de Grace. Although very entertaining and well played these recordings are not on that same level as the stranglers had in the 1977-1983 period. But still it's good entertainment for real fans of modern rock."
5,Wonderful book,I have read this book cover-to-cover. This book is very insightful and provides you with the realization and aspect of other peoples lives.A must read!
3,Disappointed,The wheel covers were ordered properly for my size tires and fit nice and snug but one of the covers blows off the wheel when we have winds. So I'm not very happy with this product. Even though it was purchased from Amazon.
5,RV Wheel Covers,"I realy like these double lined covers. They look good and do the job. My tires are 29"" and these still fit snug. Wheel covers are a must to keep the sun off your tires. A very cheap investment."
3,These wheel covers were great.,"These were to protect my new $ 2,500 tires from UV. Tires never wear out on a big RV, but do rot thanks to the sun. Got these, they fit nicely, but along came a good wind and poof....... They're already gone. If I had them back I'd use bungy cords to strap them on. Too bad they didn't tell me that in the paper work."
1,Poor advertisement...wrong item,"I wanted good quality and these were the highest priced covers listed on Amazon. They said ""only 4 sets left...order soon"". I ordered the correct size and part number. The correct size and part # was on the receipt/invoice when they arrived (19 days later), but they sent covers for a 13"" wheel (I needed 28""). When I contacted Amazon, they said my size was no longer available so they sent these. Are you kidding me??? 13"" covers for 28"" wheels!! Who made this decision...a monkey?So I sent it back for a refund. I couldn't tell if the covers were good quality, cause I never opened the box. What a major let down after waiting almost 3 weeks. I went to a local camper store and got a set there the next day. Sometimes, saving a few bucks just ain't worth it!!"
5,RV Vinyl Tire Protectors,"These are by far, hands down the BEST tire covers for the money and actually they could sell for far more. I live in a VERY WINDY, harsh winter part of the county, the strap/weave buckle is very effective, it is made to fasten on the inside of the tire and so it is a bit of a drag to put on but once on, mine NEVER budged. I recently took them off, they have been on the tires for little more than a year, still soft and pliable as well as the flannel inside, I tossed all 4 in the washer, hung them out on the fence and they are like brand new!! I am ordering another set of 4 to have for back up, you won't find this quality just sitting around on Walmart shelves, these babies are built tough."
4,RV tire covers,"Arrived on time, as promised.They are heavy vinyl, with a ""flannel"" lining. Seem to be good quality..I would find an additional way to secure them however. In windy conditions they have a tendency to blow off. We've spent some time hunting for one of them on our property! A bungi cord or some other way to fasten them down lower, would help.Otherwise, we're very happy with them."
5,"Easy on, easy off!","Very pleased with these covers. Nice lining, very flexible, very easy to put on and take off. I'd buy again."
4,Accurate but chunky,"As a teacher, I am timed to the minute at work so this watch is a life saver because it is always accurate. The time and day are easy to read and the indiglo feature is also terrific. For a ladie's watch it is awfully bulky and not even slightly feminine. The velcro wrist strap combined with the thick & bulky watch means it is uncomfortable no matter how you adjust it. That being said, the watch is fully adjustable-which is good for a woman with tiny wrists-like me. It's unprofessional looking and it has a zillion features that I'll never use, I may end up giving it to my tween-age son -once I find a more elegant version at a reasonable price. It;s a good watch over-all. I've worn Timex all my life-they never break."
5,Great Watch!,"I was desperately searching for a new radio control atomic watch for women. I ordered this one without reading the full description. After receiving it and finding the velcro band, I thought I had made a mistake. But after using it, I am really glad I kept it. I have a tiny wrist and being able to manually adjust the strap is a big plus for me.Also, I like the size of the numbers as I have trouble reading small print. It seems to be user friendly and the directions are easy to understand.A great little watch!"
2,Timex Marathon Radio Controlled Atomic Watch,I must have gotten a dud as this watch does not change time automatically. Went to Guatemala in July and traveled from NC to Houston to Guatemala and never once did the watch change time zones. Had to do it manually. Huge disappointment.
4,Timex Women's T5G341 Marathon Radio Control Watch,"Pros: Good watch, has no problem syncing with time radio every day at 2:00 AM (except during solar flare, which is expected)Cons: Too big, doesn't display the date on the main screen"
2,Great Concept-Poor Execution,"Great concept for a watch but poorly executed in production. After a little more than a year, the indiglo no longer works, one end of the band is ripped off (the band started deteriorating within a few months), and one of the plastic ends where the band loops through broke off. No, I was not abusing the watch - but plastic and poorly sewn cheap products have a tendency to deteriorate fast. That said, the main part of the watch works well (except for the indiglo which I really wanted!), I like the different functions, and believe the concept of a velcro wristband is a great idea (I have small wrists). I would like to give this a higher rating but because of the poor materials and construction, it will have to be 2 stars, and I would NOT recommend this to anyone who would like a watch to last at least two years!"
5,Only one?,"This watch is set from the atomic clock in Colorado. From me I get it into set mode and find a place to set it outside where it gets the best signal and leave it for 10 minutes or so. I don't think I've ever not have it set. This is my second one of these and the first one lasted through much abuse, even glaze for faux paint. I may buy a third just to have it because when trying to find a replacement for the old one, I couldn't find an atomic clock watch so I liked this one up and was pleased to see amazon had one I could still buy."
2,Watch Band....,"Watch works great, however watch band broke after 3 months and you cannot replace band."
2,Nice - but NARROW,"As others have said, this may be a nice cot, but I don't see how they can call it ""oversized"" because it is very, let me emphasize, VERY, narrow. Perhaps if you are very slender this might be okay, but a normal sized person, nah. It is well made, however, I'll give it that! :0P"
5,So Comfy!,"Great buy, I purchased a folding cot for my ""step-daughter"" to sleep on and the springs make it too bouncy for me as an adult. I bought this camping cot for my 8 yr old son and I love it! Find it too be much more comfortable and just the right size. It is a little narrow for a ""big"" person, but I have slept in it and found no problems. Remember it is a cot, not a bed and its 1/2 price of traditional bouncy folding beds. Highly reccomend."
3,"Good, but not challenging","I typically workout everyday (doing spin class, weights, running) and I have run 2 Half Marathons, so this video was not really challenging. However, on a very tired day (which seems to happen often when in the 1st trimester) this video is a good relaxing and semi-challenging video that is safe for you and baby and good for stretching."
3,She is peppy & good yoga stretches,"I have a few prenatal exercise DVDs & this one is OK. Tracey is peppy & clear & definitely an athlete. This is mostly yoga, in my opinion & not much weight training or pilates. The yoga positions are great but I expected a bit more of a mix of the other methods as well. There is a section on core or abs that is VERY difficult to do, even earlier in the pregnancy so many women will not be able to do it (push up style positions) Not a bad video but not the best either"
2,WAY too easy,"This isn't really a workout. It's like a series of very easy warm-up exercises. Very slow. The reason I gave it two stars rather than one is that my 5 year old likes doing the partner exercise routine with me, and it's the only pregnancy dvd she'll consent to do with me; and it's arguably better than nothing. But it really doesn't get you worked out. (Also, I personally hate the partner routine; the husband is so smarmy! But that's a side issue). This will work for you if you hardly move at all, and need some stretches. Not for actual working out."
3,"Good Yoga and Pilates, not great for toning.","I didn't realize when I purchased this item that it is a yoga/pilates style workout. This is fine for days when you're low on energy, but it doesn't really give you a good workout. I found it to be too easy. It didn't challenge my muscles the way I expected it to. Much better prenantal workout DVD's are: Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean Prenantal, Summer Sanders Prenantal workout, & The Perfect pregnancy workout with Karyne Steben."
3,Tracey Mallett's 3 in 1 Pregnancy System,"Just OK, I was expecting more of an intense workout. This video has alot of stretching & I was wanting more Core & Strength intensity."
3,Good for women that are not used to working out,"I find this video to be very relaxing but also very boring. If you enjoy working out before your pregnancy, this might be a little boring for you."
4,"great stretching, not much sweating.","This is a great prenatal video, especially when you don't have the energy to do the hard cardio stuff. It doesn't work up a sweat, but it has some nice toning exercises and some great stretching and relaxing. Easy enough for anyone, and even has some stretches you can do with your partner. It may not be as good as going to the gym everyday, but it's better for my body than sitting on the couch!"
1,Didn't even get through it,I attempted this video once. It was very slow moving and I found the instructor a bit annoying.
3,"ok, but a little boring","It's not bad but I wasn't looking forward to it. Now that I delivered my precious little guy, I use Jillian Michaels, and couldn't be happier."
2,Okay,A little slow paced for me. This workout would be better for women who are not active on a regular basis.
4,Good video,"I purchased this video and ""FitMama"". This one is a little slower paced (which doesn't quite fit my personality) but is very relaxing. She is great and walking you though step by step what to do. Easy to follow, relaxing and a really good prenatal video."
4,An invigorating prenatal workout,"This DVD will be perfect for anyone seeking a moderate-to-high intensity prenatal workout. After trying a number of prenatal yoga and fusion DVDs and finding them too slow and not enough of a workout, this is the first prenatal workout DVD that really fit the bill for me. It incorporates all my favorite pilates exercises, only slightly modified to accommodate for pregnancy. The 3 sections allow you to customize your workout -- you can do a core-conditioning workout and combine it with either upper body or lower body, or do all three for a complete workout. Each section is only about 20 minutes so it's easy to fit at least one workout in every day."
4,Overall good,"I really like the exercises that Tracy Mallett does, but I don't feel like I get enough of a workout unless I do the entire DVD (which I usually don't have time to do). Also, it moves a little slow for my taste. However, I have done it enough that I no longer put in the video and just quickly run through the exercises at my pace and I really like that."
3,Wanted more cardio,"I really wanted more cardio and this one doesn't have any on it, but it is good for pregnancy stretches and training."
5,Love this pregnancy workout!,"Great pregnancy workout for all fitness levels and stages of pregnancy! This is my favorite pregnancy workout DVD because it's challenging yet relaxing. I have enjoyed doing pilates (classes and DVD workouts) for a few years now, and I like how Tracey Mallett incorporates pilates, yoga, and light weight training for a well-rounded workout. I also like how the DVD is broken up into different segments, so I can do the whole thing if I have the time, or just 1-2 segments. I highly recommend this one!!"
3,"Short, informative and easy to read.",It was a good introduction to the man and his life. It was concise and followed his lifeline .It is a good invitation to read more and study his work more in depth to understand his virtue and why he is being considered for sainthood.Ivy May Bolton presented an inspiring account of the life and times of the old very west even before we became an independent nation.
3,book for husbands,The books were given as a a gift for a newly wed couple .. so hopefully they read it and it was ok
3,Good but Too Short,"I love the quotes in the book--thoughtful and fun reading. However, I think it's much too short. I thought I was reading the introduction, but it was the actual book--seemed like it was over after only a few minutes. The author of the quotes and their age and marital status actually take up more space than the reading."
2,disappointed,"probably not the best purchase. disappointed by the context. Thought it would be more insightful, but could have been my misunderstanding."
4,good ideas,"There are many good ideas throughout this book. Some are obvious, but still a good bit of information. You can learn how to be the wife your husband desires. There is not a lot of depth, however. It is a collection of quotes and nothing more. Why not ask your husband how you can be his perfect wife?"
3,Nice inspirational quotes but not something that is going to save your marriage.,"I thought hsi book was going to be full of helpful hints written in ""book"" format. All it was were short, one-sentence quotes from other people on things that helped their marriage. No research to back up anything. A nice read but not work more than $1 total."
4,Fuel for the Newlywed Soul,"This book is by no means a wonderpill for awful relationships or a bible for the newlyweds, but no book really is. What this serves as is more of a running start for people who plan to stay together forever. The advice is sound and badly needed, although some of the ""experts"" have been divorced several times. Other than that, it's a solid four out of five as far as good advice for long, loving relationships. And the reader doesn't feel like they're being psychoanalyzed by a book. This is the healthy marriage book for people who don't want to be therapied to death."
4,Son's Christmas Gift,"I have not heard any complaints from him, so I assume it's working and he likes it......He has played the game with no problems."
1,A gamer,This is the worst game I have ever played .It is way to short and has no real reason to play becuase its so boreing .So you should not buy this game its a waste of money.
4,review,shipped fast and came just as described. very few scratches on both disc it also had original case with artwork and manual.
3,Very awesome but not what I wanted.,"This was not the resident evil 2 I ordered! I wanted resident evil 2 dual shock not the original, but I was very pleased in the qualilty and condition of the game and case."
5,Great Game!,This game was basically brand new and in great condition. Safely wrapped as well. Great Service!
5,"Dude buy this game,you will not be believe your eyes","Dude,I speak from exprince because I'b been playing this game since the 1st resident evil game came out..and let me tell you something when people buy this game they can't stop playing it. why only because it's so good,not even a movie can compare this games,not part 1 2 or 3 because the story never stops. your heart will pound the whole game without stoping I promise you that,so if you like horror movies and games this game is a must buy,but not to kill the suspence buy all 3 Resident Evil three games if you want to know all the truth......."
2,This game STINKS!,"I was introduced to the first game by a friend, I thought the game was really weird and stupid,but I wanted to play the game.When I found out a second game was coming out,I saved money for a playstation and a copy of RE2.I enjoyed it at first but it got boring fast with repetitive zombies,awful sound effects and a mediocre story line.The characters don't walk, but rather they slide across the floor and the characters are rather stiff walking.I would rent this game before buying, or get dreamcast with RE:Code Veronica,that is a great game."
5,SPOOKY ....,"THIS GAME IS SO INCREDIBLY FRIGHTENING. I'M NOT EVEN FINISHED WITH THE GAME (IN ROOKIE MODE) AND THE GAME IS ALREADY CONSUMING MY LIFE. ZOMBIES COME LIMPING TOWARD YOU, UGLY, KILLING THINGS COME AT YOU FROM EVERY ANGLE POSSIBLE. THIS GAME TAKES YOUR MIND ON A TWISTED JOURNEY THROUGH THE DEPTHS OF HELL. RESIDENT EVIL 2 SEDUCES YOUR SOUL, INFECTS YOUR BRAIN IN BELIEVING THE SURREAL. IF YOU LIKE A GAME THAT ISOLATES YOU FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD, THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU. P.S.: DON'T FORGET TO COME BACK TO REALITY!"
5,A VERY UNDERATED GAME,These kinds of game deserves to be recognized and should never be forgotten. There isn't a person on earth that can easily turn away a game like Resident Evil 2 without having tasting it. This is what expect from a game that revolves around zombies and corporate conspiracies. From beginning to end you are hooked maybe not scared but hooked until you have completed the game. Learn your roots!!
4,Best RE game overall,"I would give it ****1/2 but that's not an option.I have to say that this is the best RE game out of all four so far. It's better looking and more story oriented than RE 1, more challenging than RE 3, and more fun than all of them.I especially like how William Birkin is constantly changing forms. The whole crew of G-Virus monsters just rules.Also, this game is challenging (Though not as much as the first one), fun, scary, and packed with extras, making it great for all gamers.This game should be bought, or at least rented and renewed about 10 times."
5,Remo Renaissance Emperor,"This head sits perfectly on my Sonor Delite snare. It just opens up the shell of the drum and makes the drum so so sensitive. I tried a Remo coated ambassador but found myself looking for a bit more. I found it in this head. It has the meat to take a beating,its perfect for most types of playing and is sensitive to your stick.Some people might say,Why an Emperor on your snare? For me,it just works and my drum has never sounded better!"
1,What you see is not what you get,"I liked the look of these jeans and ordered them in light indigo. What I got is pretty much a plain vanilla pair of jeans with a bit of wash around the knees. Definitely not the look portrayed in the pictures. The number product number matches the number on casualmale site so they did send me the right ones, they just don't look like anything shown on the pictures..."
4,Excellent all around,"I got this movie because I'm a huge fan of Sylvia Sidney, and as always she's brilliant. The outdoor scenes are beautiful to behold, and it always makes me wonder why they didn't shoot more in color back then after it was invented. They had the technology, so why the heck didn't they do it more often ?. Don't get me wrong, I love b/w films, but it would've been nice to see more movies shot in color. -Take good old Nigel Bruce, this could very well be his only color film, although I'm not sure on that. The only thing that is a little annoying, is the constant singing of a pretty awful song, which seem more than a bit out of place. (-I understand it was even nominated for an Oscar !.) Sidney's character's quick rise to success in the big city is also a little strange and sudden, we don't get the feeling she's been gone very long. Other than that I liked it. All Fonda and Sidney fans should have this movie, and I'm sure they already do."
2,Gil Scott Heron lost his edge,"Well, wouldn't you know it! Even people with ruthless passion have the ability to become nothing more than a by the numbers sloth. Issuing albums and making music is probably more because that's what's expected from him (Gil) rather than anything else. What can I say... Gil Scott Heron lost his spunk! Sorry Gil. Move over and let a young poet with a stronger hold on current events take your sorry place."
3,"Good, but not the ""Best of""","""The Divine Stevie Nicks"" can be deceiving unless you're already familiar with Stevie's music. If you're expecting a ""Best Of"" album, think again. ""The Divine Stevie Nicks"" borrows songs from only two of Stevie's albums, ""The Wild Heart"" and ""The Other Side of the Mirror"". To hear Stevie's best, or to start a Stevie collection, buy ""Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks"" or ""The Enchanted Works of Stevie Nicks"" box set. Don't get me wrong, ""The Divine"" includes some great music (Stand Back, Ghosts, If Anyone Falls), but it leaves out treasures from ""Bella Donna"" and ""Rock a Little"", two of her best albums(Stop Draggin' My Heart Around, Leather and Lace, Talk to Me).Of course, ""The Divine Stevie Nicks"" is essential for true collectors, but they won't be hearing anything new. If you're not a die-hard Stevie fan, stick to her original albums or a Fleetwood Mac staple (Rumours, Greatest Hits, The Dance)."
3,Not for younger players,"For those who prefer simpler games (run, jump, point, shoot) this game is not for you. Learning the controls to talk to other Mudokons will be frustrating to both children and the impatient alike. It will be near impossible for those who cannot read yet. For non-English speaking people there is the option to select a different language, which I thought was cool. I forgot what they all were, but other languages include German, Spanish, French and maybe Italian."
2,Oddworld IS a letdown,"I have the first in this series for my playstation. This translation into gameboy color is disappointing. The only thing that gave it 2 stars instead of 1 or 0 was that the characters can say four phrases. Even for gameboy color, it shouldn't be THIS bland and boring."
3,Back in my day.....,"which wasnt a long time ago, but this 'shakey flakey' game boy animation was just putrid. From any stand point you would look at a slurgs (aka the lil green blobby things that come out of the blue and eat you for no reason) and youd think it was the FOLLOWING: A.) A BLOB OF GREEN SLOG (Those freaking ... of a dog) CRAP, B.) A PLANT OR C.) WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? In short? My review goes only to that the animation sucked, and that the plot was scarcilly short, stanky, and the only reason I wouldnt give it a LOWER rating is because those damned sligs were kickin .... Oh yes and being a true fan of Simpsons I must end my review as so...."
5,Great film but terrible DVD,"Rating applies to the film as I imagine it could be, if properly reproduced. Fortunately, the original 102 minute version and not the cut USA version is available. The DVD sound reproduction is so bad that subtitles are needed."
3,One of our aircraft is missing,"A fair print but as we are unable to get a pristine one, this is worthwhile. A mirror of their previous film 'The 49th Parallel'Anything from the' Archers' is worth the expense and the trouble"
2,Disappointing Sound,"I had not heard much of Mr. Sullivan's playing before this recording, and upon listening to it, I was rather disappointed. Technically he is excellent, his execution throughout the range and style of all these works is incredible. The varied genre that he covers is also commendable, there is some good recital repetoire that can be found on this disk. However, Mr. Sullivan's sound was what really disappointed me. It just seems so shallow, not very full at all. The end of the beautiful Nessun Dorma was especially disappointing. Listen to this CD for ideas of recital repetoire, but certainly not as an example of trumpet tone. Recordings of Maurice Andre and others are much better and more desirable examples."
4,"Good, solid album","This is the American version of Megaherz's ""Wer Bist Du?"" album. Unfortunately it's the only one of their albums that's domestically made, which is why I chose to get this first instead of ""Herzwerk II."" I can't say I'm as impressed with this as with what I've heard from their other albums, but it's still a good album. The only problem is that Alexx chooses to rap for most of the album. And yes, I mean rap. I guess this album could be described as hip-hop metal, but in this case that's not a bad thing. This album is very well done.The highlights:Gott SeinWer Bist Du?Schlag ZuruckLichtKrone der ShopfungTanze GehenDie Gedanken Sind Frei"
5,Loved It!,I found this CD to sound a lot like Rammstein which certainly isn't a problem as far as I'm concerned. I don't have much to say about it other than the fact that I throughly enjoyed it and if you like German rock than you might want to consider buying this CD.
2,buyer beware !,"This box set is in fact NOT the official 3 Ninjas Trilogy. The official order of the trilogy is as follows; 3 Ninjas (1992), 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up (shot back to back with the first movie also in 1992 but not released until 1995), and 3 Ninjas Kick Back (1994). This advertised box set includes the three sequels but not the original 3 Ninjas film. Read my separate reviews for each 3 Ninjas movie for more information. I hope this is helpful."
3,It isnt the best,"I watched the first and the second movies and i LOVED them. When i watched 3 ninjas High noon and i hated it. The actors werent the same and it wasnt as good. if i had another choice i would just get the 3 ninjas, 3 ninjas knuckles up, and 3 ninjas Kick back."
3,Not the three movies that I was looking for,"Only one of three of these movies were the real thing though they weren't all bad. I prefer to watch what I thought I was paying for, so no 5 stars from me."
3,"Reasoning behind ""Trilogy""","The reason that this set is considered a trilogy is because the first movie was distributed by Touchstone Pictures, and the last three were Tristar. I'm going to guess that Tristar was not able to get the rights to the first movie, and as a result you have a pseudo trilogy.I hope this clears things up."
4,"Good, but where's the first one?","I am a hug fan of the 3 ninjas, I just don't understand why they would make a ""trilogy"" of a 4 part movie series. This set contains Kick Back (movie 2), Knuckle Up (movie 3), and High noon at Mega Moutain (movie 4), but some how they neglected the first movie. All on all this is a great set, it is fun to watch them again. For some reason the 3 kids shown on the cover of Knuckle Up aren't even in the movie, but it is better because this on has the 3 main characters back in there roles from the first movie."
4,Mini Cooper,The purchase was for my nephew. He is fascinated by Coopers. He was very happy to get them.
1,Be ware of cheep compilations flooding the market,"Essentially a repackaging of Yes Friends and Relatives featuring recent live Yes recordings - like from Keys to Ascension, plus various recent solo track.There's a whole series of this black-boxed ""Story"" series. It's merely a way for a minor label to cash in on artists that had once release stuff through them. Such products merely flood the market. Check out the discography on [...] to see was releases are authorised by the group."
4,Its sights were set maybe too high...,"This text is a great overview of all things involving human sexuality. However I believe the piece suffers from trying to cover too much. It is very broad. But it works. Other complaints against it is the banter between the female author and the male authors--basically there are a lot of ""typical male"" and other such non-academic passages. Though not bad here and there, I felt there was too much and often (instead of being humorous)it came off as just annoying."
5,Excellent Book,"I purchased this book as a text book not knowing what to expect. Turns out it is very interesting, covering a plethora of topics. I definitely recommend it."
2,The RAZR is overrated!,"I am probably the least picky person when it comes to purchasing a cell phone. I use only the basic functions on a phone and I was still disappointed with this one. Maybe all the higher end functions make this phone worthwhile, but I doubt that I will use them. I like to use the camera on my phone for taking pictures of memorable moments when I don't have my camera with me. I didn't realize how far inferior the camera is on the RAZR compared to the phone I used to have, the Samsung A670 which I considered a pretty basic phone. The pictures are dark and the quality is aweful, with lines running through everywhere. I tried changing the picture quality and the brightness but it didn't make them any better. Too bad I'm stuck with this one for the duration of my two year contract. Not impressed."
2,Worst phone I have ever had.,"I know everyone is buying the RAZR phones because they are 'cool' compared to your average cell phone. But I cannot stress enough that this phone is a bad buy.My experience has been that:- It loses its charge very quickly, that is my main complaint. Especially if you leave it on in an area that it doesn't get reception in (ex: the subway) it seems to drain itself. If I unplug it from the charger in the morning and it goes through normal (if not minimal) usuage, it will be dead by the end of the day.- The keypad is a pain.- The camera isn't very good.- When setting the phone to 'alarm only' it still lets calls that have been set to their own ringtone through.- Some of the settings are difficult to figure out.So, that's what I have to say about the phone. I would have rather just kept my not-as-stylish phone than have this one. So what if it wasn't hip and with it? It was much more reliable. But, the hype got to me, I wish I wasn't such a sucker for the colour pink."
1,Amazon has POOR customer service.,"DO NOT BUY A CELL PHONE FROM AMAZON!!!I bought this phone on Dec 15th, they delayed my ship date from the one promised when I placed the order so I had to call them and change shipping to 2nd day so I can get it by Xmas. They charged me extra. Then after I received the phone I found out the pictures are terrible, it comes out blurry and washed out.I called Amazon to try to get them to upgrade my phone. I was willing to pay extra. I just get the run around. Amazon blames Verizon, Verizon says call Amazon, and so on. I spent 2 days and 4 hours and got absolutely nowhere.Now they say if I cancel I have to pay a $175 per line cancellation fee!This is within 14 days of starting my service.Think about it, if you have a problem with your order, would they help you? Can you even find a phone number to call them? Or do you have to trade emails back and forth? How much is your time worth?DO NOT BUY A CELL PHONE FROM AMAZON!"
2,Substandard Phone,"Since purchasing cell phones I have owned probably 10 or so.This RAZR is the only Motorala product I have purchased.What a mistake. Every morning I get the familiar beepingto let me know it has a low battery...yes, every morning.After having it for about 45 days it became difficult tohear people on the other end, even with the volume on high.The real kicker is this, those who also own a RAZR complain tome about the same issues...low battery life, poor sound quality.When we've complained we get the same response, buy amore expensive battery. Although the RAZR looks reallysleek and modern for a cell phone, my experience with ithas been a disappointment. It is a substandard piece ofequipment in comparison to other cell phones I have owned.Good luck in your search."
1,Worst Phone Ever.....,"I was spending so much time at Verizon with this ridiculous phone.It's bad enough that the battery only lasted one day, the worst part is that it would freeze up and not let any calls go out or come in!On another fun filled day at Verizon standing in line, the tech that helped us had 9 other razr phones piled up that they had taken in with problems just that day!Bought an LG, no problems."
3,"eh, its alright","I have had this phone for almost 2 years. It has been an okay phone. I think the only real problems I have had with this phone is that recently there has been like a really loud clicking when it rings so I can barely hear the song over it, and then it will do that when I am on the phone also. I have never gotten any water in it or dropped it so I dont know why its making that noise. Also I hate how I cant change the front picture on the little screen, it is always red and I dont like that its red with pink, maybe im too picky but I wish I could change that.Other than that its pretty sturdy and it lasted up till about a few months ago. I am going to upgrade soon but it has treated me well. The picture quality is pretty good as long as you are really still, otherwise it can be a little blurry"
3,"SO, SO.","My wife saw this ""pink"" cell phone on a TV show and had to have it. So, I surprised her with it. Other than the looks and size this is just a functional phone that works, so, so. But, that is all my wife is looking for, a cell phone that has a speaker which she uses for our grandkids to share conversations. She also confesses that she knows how to use the camera, but never uses it. She's happy. :)"
2,Horrible Battery life !!!,The phone as a whole is very delicate. The color comes off very easily. It has horrible battery life does not even last for one day even if you hardly use the cell phone for 10 min a day.
2,"an alright phone, but lots of problems","Okay, well I just got my second razor yesterday and Ive only has this for 8 days. The last v3m razor that I had, froze constantly, the texting always lagged, and I wouldnt even get a texting menu anymore telling me I had a new text, the text would just pop up. So I really got mad and returned the phone yesterday, but since I got locked into taht 2 year contract thing, I had to just get a replacement. So I got a replacement, and the battery is amazing now(i only got 7 hours at the most out of my phone) and the texting is fine now, but now, it doesnt let me know when I get a new voicemail. I have to go and check my voicemail every 5 minutes to see if I have a new one. It is soo annyoing. I am never buying a razor ever again! It is the worst phone EVER! Don't even think about buying this thing! You'll just have problems after problems after problems. I can't wait to get rid of this thing."
4,Great end to the Series,"I got hooked on this series last year, and totally fell in love with the simple romance of it all. This book, which I waited for forever to get, surprised me. It wasn't as well written as the others, as I had expected it to be, but it was a good end to the series, and still finished it in less than three days. It let you know where everyone that you had grown to love was heading in their life. A good solid effort. I enjoyed it, and would recommend it to anyone who likes romance, and is above 16. Otherwise you won't be able to appreciate it nearly as much."
5,I loved it soooooo much!,"I cried, laughed, got mad, was thrilled, and all in this awesome book! I loved it! Christy has been a friend to me, and I'm sad that the book is over. I've been looking foreward to reading it for so long! I know that Mrs. Gunn will write more though! She wouldn't leave us hanging on what happened! Well, it was Great! 5 huge stars!:-)"
1,Never received,"I ordered my magazine subscription in November 2006. I have never received a single copy. I am not even able to get my money back. Nobody at Amazon knows how to find out what happened. I have sent 4 emails and called both Amazon and Amazon subscription service, to no avail."
3,"Comfortable, big, but difficult to set up","I love this cot as much as my wife hates it. It's big, wide and comfortable...which is why I like it. It's also very, very difficult to set up...which is why my wife hates it. It stores and unfolds nicely, but installing the cross supports on the ends requires herculean strength. You have to pull the fabric tight and slide the supports down over a retaining knob, but it's very, very difficult to stretch the fabric enough to do this. I can do it, but my wife (she's strong, by the way) has great difficulty. it's impossible for my 12 year old son. Overall it's a good cot, but be aware of these set-up issues. It's the reason I dropped it from a 5 star rating to a 3."
3,hard to assemble for the first few times,"I found it hard to assemble the second of the transversal end bars: it takes a lot of energy to overcome the pull of the fabric. eventually, two people with weight-lifting training working together could do it...for the rest, it is a standard military cot bed: uncomfortable but OK for emergencies. I appreciated its larger-than-normal width."
2,How to pick-up a girl in Japan.,"This product is meant for a single male trying to pick-up a Japanese female. Unless this is your intent when visiting Japan, don't bother with this product. I actually found it pretty disgusting."
5,its the best!,I love using this product and usually order 6 at a time. sometimes I give them as hostess gifts...to share the wealth so to speak. I have even taken them to Israel as special treats from America.Nothing makes my legs and arms so smooth.I am sad you are out of stock an hope you will restock soon!
3,good for nostalgia,"I bought this for nostalgic reasons and as a joke for one of my staff who just will not go home when I tell him to. So it definitely will serve. However, when I was 4 years old and being read this as a bedtime story, the book looked a LOT bigger. I don't know if the version I was shipped is just a smaller version or if the problem is that I was a smaller version of myself at the time... Not worth it for me to find out but just mentioning it as it was a surprise. So others should know this -- either there are different versions of the Dr Seuss hardcover books or else you need to remember how small once were! :)"
3,"The ""Doctor"" and the President","This is NOT a joke! Dr. Seuss' working title for this book was ""Richard M. Nixon Will You Please Go NOW!!!"" (Today's title: ""William J. Clinton Will You Please Go NOW!"")"
5,A good one for the under-two crowd,"This book was originally published at the height ofthe Watergate scandal. Dr. Seuss sent a copy tohis friend Art Buchwald, crossing out the name ""Marvin K. Mooney"" and writing in ""Richard M. Nixon."" Buchwald reprinted the whole thing in his column with the alteration. I find it impossible to read the book without this anecdote in mind! My two-year-old has no such political baggage, and though he has outgrown Marvin K. Mooney now, he enjoyed it for a long, long time. It's underrated."
4,"Not Seuss' best, but still good","I'm a big fan of Dr. Seuss, and while this isn't his best, it's still pretty good.Marvin K. Mooney is supposed to go, and that sets the scene for 25 pages of delightfully silly pictures and fun-to-say-out-loud rhymes (""Get yourself a Ga-Zoom. You can go with a boom!"").It's never clear WHY Marvin has to go, and I wonder if some kids might speculate on the reason. ""Did he do something wrong? Is he in trouble?"" (A giant hand points to Marvin as the text says ""GO!"")Still, this is a good read-aloud book that kids should like for the pictures and the rhymes."
3,Not my favorite Dr. Seuss,"You can't go wrong with Dr. Seuss of course, but this one isn't one of my favorites. Silly text and illustrations as always, but the story is just okay."
3,Bonus tracks,"I guess in the US you would call them bonus tracks. Actually, the song Daddy's Girl is the one to look for: I rated the album 3 stars but would rate the song 5 stars, i.e. good album for Scorpions' fans; great song for anyone."
5,sensational,"I came across the group in 1976 in Lagos, Nigeria during the 2nd World Black and african festival of Arts. I saw every performance of this sensational troupe during the festival. Later in London, I was there every night listening to the stomping of the feet and the rhythmics of the drums. Pity I lost my record. I hope the CD is available soon."
1,Wish I could give 0 stars,"Crappiest item ever. My daughter said she was having trouble making it work in her locker. I figured she was just being a whiner. When I went to look, it seemed lightweight plastic, and it had a clever 5"" turning knob, to expand/contract. I put the shelf in the locker and tightened it up. I then put a book on the shelf. (just a normal math book) The shelf immediately came crashing down.I then put the shelf back up and tightened it up as hard as I could. Now I put the math book on, and it held just fine. I put the science book on (each book approx 1.5"" binder) and it stayed up. Then I put the English book (same size) on, and the shelf collapsed!The plastic has white marks where it bent and the clever little knob turns and turns, but nothing happened.I paid 15$ for this, and it's utter crap.I want my money back, this is worthless!!!"
2,Lockermate Locker Shelf,"My daughter loved this shelf and was all excited to put it in her locker the first day of school, but when she turned the knob to make it fit her locker the plastic broke near the knob and would not lock so she never even got to use it. :("
2,Misrepresented,"When I purchased this item via Amazon, I was able to click on the color blue and added it to my cart. It arrived hot pink. My male middle schooler is not happy. If all they have available is pink, they should state ""only available in pink""."
3,adjust-a-shelf = tilt-a-shelf,"while I really like this shelf for half the year, it has a tendency to fall down about halfway through the year because it isn't always balanced. Also the longer one has it the more often it will fall down or tilt to one side enough that it is no longer useful. That is why I would recommend a shelf with legs unless you are willing to keep it balanced or are a 'born organized' person who will not have a problem keeping it from tilting. Another thing, over the course of the year, keep things on the top shelf kinda light or it will slip down as well. If the tilting didn't happen I would give this shelf 5 stars as I have seen it in many colors so one can choose one that they like."
1,"Flimsy, difficult to use",I purchased this adjustable shelf for my gym locker. There were no instructions in the box - which would have explained easier way to expand the shelf. I finally got it in my locker and it worked for ONE day before crashing down. It is flimsy and doesn't work!
2,can't handle the weight of school binders,"We used this in my daughter's locker. I bought two of them and put one close to the top of the locker for small items. The other went just above her textbooks to hold her subject matter binders. This one keeps failing. The little ""lock"" on the side that keeps it from sliding closed broke and I had to swap it for the one up top. I'm still looking for something in this category that will actually do what I need."
5,beautiful,"It's a very beautiful story.... transcendent and sad at times, romantic at others, etc. I love especially the little descriptions of West Lake in Hangchow and the surrounding areas. It all goes with the plot so beautifully. Very special is also the values expressed in this novel, such that in this busy and modern world of ourse we may not see."
4,On Target,"The above reviewer falls into that category of individuals, bitter as dark chocolate, who are enraged and infuriated by the ability of Western men to come to Japan as English teachers and attract the attention of Japanese women who are ""out of their league"". Most people, however, merely find the situation curious and amusing but hardly upsetting and worth ranting about on the internet. I think the authors of this hilarious comic strip fall into the latter category. I think at least some of the authors were themselves English teachers in Japan, so this is a case of people writing what they know. Some of the comic strips fall flat, but most will make you laugh, especially if you know a thing or two about Japan. A good, quick read if you happen to be on a long trip by plane, train, or bus."
1,Racial stereotypes,"I think there is something implictly racist about the stereotype this book creates. In essence, it assumes that Japanese women (or other minority women) are de facto *inferior* to Caucasian or western women. The men dating Japanese women must be ""losers"" because they can't get prized White women who, it goes without saying, are preferable and superior to minorities. It's a pretty offensive, condescending and ultimately racist message, and rather suprising that the authors never considered their own deep-seated prejudices."
2,Royal Canin--Not the crown jewels of dog food,"I tried this pricey dog food for my Australian shepherd on the advice of a friend who has a small dog does that does very well on one of their foods geared for toy dogs. First of all, making a decision on what food to buy is confusing. They have many breed specific foods and to look at all the bags is exhausting. With the help of a sales clerk I picked the Medium Breed adult. My dog, at first did like the food very much but I felt he was overwhelmed by the amount of food I had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it. The ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils. Certainly this was not worth the price tag."
4,Wishing for Wind Words,"Like a previous reviewer I was entranced by the beautiful simplicity of ""Wind Words"" on the ""Freedom is Frightening"" album. I still have it on vinyl, but would really like to hear it on a CD or DVD-Audio. I remember the patterns that it [the last track on the disk] threw in the light as the disk span. Happy Days. :-)I found these reviews after hearing it again on ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"". It's still marvellous after all these years. ""Sea & Sky"" was inspired and well worth adding to a collection. Let's hope they'll release ""Freedom is Frightening"" on a digital medium.Leon"
5,Excellent apron for a little boy!,It's easy to fit appropriately around a young child's neck and washes easily with a sponge. Great for boys toddler and older. Love it!
5,Good as a small group classroom activity.,"This game has worked really well with small groups of 1st graders. Although the game is supposed to be random, you can set it up so that the strongest readers get the harder cards and everyone has a chance to win. It's a fun way practice sounds and blending."
4,My Kindergartener Loves It!,"My son grew up with ThinkFun's 'Zingo', so 'What's Gnu?' was kind of a logical next step for him. The setup is much the same -- tiles stored in a sliding dispenser that releases two tiles at once. The tiles are 'called' by the players and placed on a card, in this case to form 3-letter words. He's just to the point of sounding out these simple words, so What's Gnu is proving to be a valuable and fun learning tool for him.The only downside is, of course, that the tiles are easy to lose if you're not pretty disciplined about putting them back in the dispenser and back in the box. We struggled more with Zingo than with What's Gnu in this area, but it's still a concern worth thinking about if your household is pretty crazy, as ours is."
5,FUN! Even adults enjoy this game!,"This game is so fun! Adults enjoy it as well! Easy to learn. All of my daughters friends enjoy this. Every time a child plays this, they ask their parents to purchase the game."
4,skill builder,It was easy for me to adapt the rules to the needs of my 5 year old grandson.... possibilities are endless but an encouraging adult is needed to help keep a good pace and keep young ones encouraged and not overwhelmed. It's really an excellent skill builder.
1,letters are in all caps,"Thought the idea of this game was wonderful. I purchased it for my 5 year old son, but was very disapointed to open the package and realize the letters were in all caps. Children do not learn to read with all capital letters so why would a learning game be made in this manner??? I plan to return the item."
4,"For ""new age"" instrumentals, this is one of the best I've heard...","The name ""Deuter"" was not familiar to me, and in general I am not much interested in ""new age"" music, although I confess to having owned several albums in the genre over the past few decades. But I saw this at an estate sale for 75 cents, and the notes on the back said recorded in Santa Fe, (although the songs include tracks inspired in Hawaii, France and Peru) so I bought it. I'm pleased. It is nice to hear while driving, or in the background of a Scrabble game. I think most of it is too lively to play while a person is trying to meditate (a practice I gave up in the late '70's) but as a modern version of the lounge music popularized by Martin Denny and Arthur Lyman back in the late '50's, this is a successful release."
3,Mixed reviews,"While I very much liked some of the tracks on this CD, others were a bit disappointing to me. To my mind there wasn't as much ""continuity"" in this album as in other Deuter albums I've purchased. I didn't feel this album was as appropriate to use as background for Reiki sessions as many of his other albums, though I do like it for just music ""to live by."""
1,Watch runs intermittently-Unreliable Timex #T2C471,"I bought this beautiful looking Timex watch for my brother in March 2007. After just one month in use, it would stop working for days at a time and start up again. This intermittent service has made this watch quite useless. I have given one star for its looks and nothing else. I will not recommend and will definitely not buy another Timex."
5,Blue glasses,"These colored glasses have frosted textured rings that make them easy to grip. They are fine in the dishwasher, and have been sturdy and break-resistant so far. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
4,Good value ...,"These glasses make a great gift. They are large enough to accommodate a large iced tea or lemonade. The blue tint adds an elegant touch. My only criticism is that they are quite heavy - even when they are empty.However, they are a good value for the price."
4,Nice product,"Overall, this is not a bad product for a girls aged 10-13. And the price was right. . .fast shipping!"
3,"Leaky, messy, but dishwasher safe.","I purchased this frother to replace a battery operated aerator that was not dishwasher safe and hard to keep really clean. I typically only use 1/4 cup milk in my coffee, however this frother has a minimum amount that must be used since the froth plunger doesn't reach all the way to the bottom of the vessel. I also prefer warm milk and this one doesn't froth warm milk very well (which I had read and was aware). So I have to go in reverse and froth first then microwave the milk. The frother does make a very nice frothy milk, but it leaks out the top where the plunger goes through the lid. For my purposes it isn't really ideal. I was trying to get an easier, cleaner product and now have a messier more laborous product. Plus I don't run my dishwasher every day so I will still have to use the aerator in between washings or just rinse the frother. Still glad I bought it and may save it for weekend cappuccino!"
3,Not Bodum quality!,"I received the Bodum Chambord 5 oz Milk Frother today. It does make a good, thick froth. My complaint is that the lid just sits on top of the glass, the ""lip"" of the top doesn't fit down over the top edge of the glass container.... it just wiggles all over while I'm pumping the froth! I expected better when buying the ""Bodum"" name! The other issue is that the plunger part is very loose in the chamber.... I expected it to fit more tightly.... Had I known the quality was this poor I would have bought a less expensive frother by another manufacturer. So to sum it up, I'm pleased with the froth, very disappointed in the quality of the product."
4,Could this also be used as a French Press?,"I picked this up at a garage sale thinking it was a French Press. Once I got it home, I realized it was a milk frother. Does anyone know if this could also be used as a French Press for coffee? Anyway, I have used this many times in the interim to make frothy milk for my coffee. I like that I can heat the milk up right in the glass (yes, be careful, it does get hot) and have nice airy milk in about 20 seconds. Easy to wash."
3,"better than other types, but not as good as it used to be","I ordered the original version of this several years ago. It made great foam. I learned to ""pump"" it in the sink, in case it overflowed a bit. I always wore gloves to protect my hands from the heat. It was great. Then the plastic ring on the bottom broke. It still worked really well, but after several months I thought I ought to buy a new one, so that I wasn't stuck with a totally broken one some morning.I got the new one a week ago and it's nowhere near as good as the original. It's built more sturdily, but that means less screening material and less foam. It's still better than the battery-powered ones."
1,It doesn't work,"I have had a Bodum milk frother for years and it works great, so I bought one for a friend. It just splashed around and didn't make any froth because the plunger no longer is the same diameter as the cylinder. They screwed up an excellent design. She returned it. Evidently it didn't occur to Bodum to try frothing milk in it."
3,great froth but glass broke after 2 days!,This hand frother makes great froth and is easy to use and clean. The problem is with the glass cylinder. The glass is too thin. After a few uses the glass shattered against the granite counter top even though we did not bang it down as we were frothing. Bodum should make the glass more substantial. I still like this frother and have replaced it and used a small rubber mat underneath it.
1,Really?,"This thing sucks. It harldy created froth, and it spills all out from the top as your pumping. real garbage. Used it once and never again."
1,Doesn't work like it used to,"My parents have one of these milk frothers, and it always worked great. When I received one as a gift, I noticed that the new ones (like mine and my sister's) no longer come with the rubber gasket that fits around the plunger. Without the gasket, there isn't a good seal around the glass, so the milk splashes up around the metal rod and leaks out of the top, and the milk hardly froths. I figured they just accidently forgot to put one on, but when I wrote to the company, they informed me that they're not putting the gaskets on anymore. It's not just mine either, because my sister's frother didn't come with the gasket and hers does the same crappy job. I would not buy this frother again."
2,Poor quality and awful customer service,The mesh screen got folded up and bent after a few months. I called customer service for parts and was told to buy a new one. Ridiculous!I bought Cuisinox CappuccinoFrother instead. It is made of stainless steel. I am happy with it.Stainless Steel Cappuccino / Milk Frother
2,Worked ok but broke in 3 months,"The product worked fine initially. Maybe a little loose fit at the top. But the glass is very thin. I was suspicious when it arrived. Sure enough, it broke within 3 months.My advice: Get one of the metal ones. I bought this one to make single cups, but realize if you have a larger metal one and want to make a small amount, you just slant the metal one to the side and it works fine."
3,messy and unpresentable to guests,"Works satisfactorily as a frother. Froth it in your kitchen not in front of your guests, because the lid does not seal well. Milk spills all over down the side and comes out the top around the shaft. Glass as great quality and microwave-safe.I thought this would work well as a single serving coffee press, but the plunger does not seal along the cylinder wall.Overall, it's worth the cost over a metal wand wisk frother. Attractive and matches your Chamford coffee press if you clean it up well before serving."
3,BODUM MILK FROTHER FROM AMAZON,"When I first tried out the Bodum milk frother, I was very disappointed with the result. I've had years of experience with frothers and, having broken my last one, ordered the Bodum frother.I had kept the plunger part from my previous frother and luckily it was an exact fit with the Bodum glass part. The next time I made froth (using the old plunger), the froth was far superior to the Bodum frother's plunger.The Bodum plunger is made up of only one piece at the bottom, whereas my previous frother's plunger has two main parts, a flange and a coil - all fixed together at the bottom of the plunger.I think that Bodum have tried to cut costs by making a plunger with only one end piece."
2,Not good,"This doesnt make very much or very good froth. This I could live with, since its still quite a practical size, you can put it in the microwave, and it looks nice.But, as many others have pointed out the milk spills over from the top through the hole in the lid. This also leads to milk leaking into the lid, between the plastic and metallic parts. Since there is no way to get the milk out the product becomes unusable in a few days - the milk goes bad and starts to smell.. The whole product becomes a health hazard!"
3,I was happy with this until I got the equivalent from Bonjour,"Pros: It does the job. You get frothed milk.Cons: There's no seal between the screen and the glass envelope, so you work really hard to make the screen take excursions through the milk and create the foam.Nevertheless, I was happy using it, until I broke the glass. To salvage it, I ended up buying a Bonjour frother, mainly because it was the same size as the Bodum. My plan was to use the carafe and continue using the Bodum screen and plunger. That was because, like I said, I was happy with the Bodum.When I got it, I figured, why not try the Bonjour Mechanism, since I have it.Well, it was so much nicer and more effective than the Bodum, I haven't bothered to use the Bodum again."
4,"I'm sure this works, but you might not need it.","I use my 3 c. Bodum Chambord Coffee Press to froth milk. It is basically the same concept: a glass carafe and a plunger with mesh. It makes a great foam. At any rate, if you already have a small coffee press, it can probably pull double-duty as a milk frother."
2,Breaks easily!!!,"It broke the first day I got it when pulling it out of the box, it hit the counter and that was it . The glass is very thin, be very gentle when using this item."
3,Fragile,"I bought two of these frothers. They worked extremely well but proved to be too fragile. One trick to get good froth is to allow air to go in while making the froth. That is, do not twist the cover to block the airflow. The glass container for the first one broke after three weeks of use. The second one arrived with a missing seal that is supposed to go around the moveable ""piston"" to prevent the milk to flow around the piston. I didn't bother returning it because I had the older seal from the broken unit. Anyway, the container for the second frother broke after two months of use and I am not planning to replace it. I wish the container was made of plastic."
5,Best kept secret,"This is one fantastic cd, more people should know about it! Sonia Dada plays a wide range of styles and sounds on this one. The vocals and bass lines are simply some of the best, along with inovative rythms from the percussions. Buy it, live it and love it (just don't go giving your love away)."
1,Made my face break out in more acne,"It seemed to cleanse my face very well, but after using it a few times I noticed that I was breaking out more often then I usually do. I stopped using it and my face started to clear up. I think after trying many different types of cleansers, the cleansers that work best for acne would be ones that foam up; this cleanser did not do that. I've tried the desert essence tea tree oil before and that one seemed to work well as a toner, so I assumed the cleanser would be good as well, but I was wrong."
3,Middle of the road...,Not the most engaging thing that Deuter has ever done...normally I love his music for theraputic relaxation. This one...not so much-kinda bland. Still love Deuter!
5,vasa or Wasa Revell model kit,"This model is very complete and requires a deal of experience and time to complete. This last summer I saw the real thing in a museum in Stockholm, Sweden. This was what inspired me to get the kit and build it. The directions are fairly clear and not to dificult to follow. The only negative remark I have is that for me it was dificult to be sure of the correct colors that the directions called for. This may have been my fault."
3,Good but could be better,"This cookbook was excellent at cutting out a lot of the fat and replacing those high fat items with tofu or other soy-based products. Unfortunately, I found a LOT of sugar to be in the recipes. I realize this book is entitled ""Beyond Low Fat Baking..."" thus indicating that it had cut back on the fat, and ""...Cancer Fighting Foods For The Millennium"" indicates the soy, but all that sugar is not healthy either. So many people have Type II Diabetes, and everyone in the US seems to be overweight, I wish she addressed this issue as well.The recipes I tried were very flavorful and tasty. In fact, there was a delicious recipe for a Spice Cake in there that my family loved.If sugar is not an issue for you, then pick this book up. But if you need to cut back on the sugar, and you do not know how to do that on your own, then do not get this book."
1,Awful,"I don't know what these other reviewers are smoking...except Nina...she hit the nail on the head. If I could give it no stars I would.I see this product is no longer available so this may be irrelevant, however, I feel the need to warn people not to buy this. If this piece of junk is no longer available because Amazon is aware of its uselessness then kudos to Amazon.Christmas present for my son. We had ideal conditions when we tried it out. Not only would it not fly, on the third landing, I said landing, not crash, it totally stopped working. Nothing, zilch. Worst purchase I have made on Amazon.The ONLY good thing about this purchase was Amazon. They accepted the return with no questions asked, credited my account and covered return shipping costs. Thank you, Amazon."
1,This plane doesn't fly and then the battery dies after 2 minutes,"We followed all the trouble-shooting advice: went out on a calm day, had the battery fully charged, pointed the plane straight ahead....and...nothing. It will fly about six feet and then lands. After doing this three times, the battery runs out, and it takes 25 min to recharge. Really NOT a fun toy. We gave this to my son for his 5th birthday. He had been looking forward to getting it for MONTHs. I did so much research on possible remote-control airplanes for young children, and this one clearly seemed like the best--the most rugged, the easiest to control. But it was a very disappointing result. I called Hasbro, and they said the plane has been discontinued for a while now. To their credit, they're sending us a refund."
2,Jim Leff is an egomaniac bent on ruling the world,"Not a terrible book, but the idea that people who use Zagat are essentially idiots, while ""Chowhounders"" are the elite of the food world is just plain emotionally disturbed thinking. Much of the info in this book is out of date, and one should really keep in mind that these are the opinions of some really obsessed people, and may not represent your personal tastes."
2,Not very helpful.,"I live in Columbia County. There are dozens of good restaurants in Albany County, Columbia County, and Dutchess County. Yet none are mentioned. I found this book a wasted of money and time."
2,Save a Tree. Log-on instead!,"What a mess! Well, the Chowhound board on the internet is a mess but that's part of the fun - the digging, hunting, and eureka, finding!! But in a book, it's annoying. In a GUIDE BOOK, it's extra heartburn aggravating. Hello, editor, major revision next time. It's fun to read but that's because Chowhound's users are fun and interesting. Chowhound should give everyone t-shirts or a percentage because without them this book is as confused as Paris Hilton's autobiography."
4,The Roxio software is a bit tricky to use.,"I am just learning to use this camera. I loaded the supplied Roxio MyDVD for Canon software on my computer and plugged in the USB cable. When you go to the video capture screen it says that this version of the software, MyDVD LE, does not support image capture. After a few phone calls back and forth with the Canon service center (in Virgina, not India which is nice), we found that you should NOT go to video capture. Duh, you have to click on DVD_Video and then on top, ""Open Disc"". This will read the disc in the camera via the USB cable. Oh, and you should finalize the disc before doing this as it might not work otherwise. It is probably faster to put the mini-disc in your computer's DVD drive if it has one. But don't forget to Finalize the disc in the camera before doing this.The camera itself has been working well. Tonight I'm going to try out the Fireworks mode to see how that works."
1,Terrible package,"We received this camera as a gift. We loved the features and the nice crisp image... until we tried to watch it on anything other than the camera's own tiny screen. My husband is pretty computer-savvy, but we couldn't get the camera to connect via USB without crashing the computer. Every time. The roxio ""my DVD"" software, in a word, sucks. You must register to use it, and it makes us re-register every time we boot up. Plus, it won't access the DVD. Finally, you can supposedly ""finalize"" the DVD to watch it directly on a DVD player or computer, but ""finalizing"" only ruins the DVD, so your memories are kaput.My in-laws got us a Canon because optics were supposed to be the most important thing about a camera. But we found out the hard way that being able to watch the videos may be even more important than image quality. Who knew that for close to $400, that was even in question? Canon should offer a product recall to everyone who bought this piece of junk."
5,Old Spice is the BEST!,"I grew up using Old Spice as a teen, and I still love it as a middle aged adult. I love Old Spice underarm deodorant and this is the best scented Hair and Body wash you can buy, if you ask me."
5,Is it right for me?,"I have hair *here*, but not *here*...Even so, Old Spice Hair & Body Wash was right for me."
2,Cheaply made but kind of cute,"Spike is much cuter than Littlefoot, however the color is wrong and material is not sturdy. Waste of money!"
3,"Decent, but not up to the Promise Ring quality","I must say I was a little disappointed by this cd. Being a fan of the Promise Ring probably set my sights a bit high, but some of the songs on this album just seem to drone on, never seeming to quite get started. It is, however, a wonderful album to listen to when you're in the mood for something mellow or to read to. I do enjoy, just not as much as a lot of other things I've listened to and would prefer to this. Good tracks: little white crosses, when the weekend comes, lightning tattoos and old blue. I would recommend this to fans of the Promise Ring's more mellow, older material (except the lyrics aren't as good, either)."
3,ok,ok is all i can say. 3 of the more lower tier movies by Segal. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who wants to get to know Steven Segal movies i would use Glimmer Man though.
2,full screen,it would have been nice if the product description mentioned this fact. i only like widescreen. i only purchased this one for the titles of the movies included in the set.
4,Classic Segal,"Full of action, cool moves and good guys always win in the end storylines. Three of Segal's best movies at his prime physical condition. I can watch tnem again and again!"
3,The story actually isn't that bad. This movie is really teetering on that 3.5 mark.,"If you have seen all of segal's stuff and want something a little different, I think you will like this. Of course they have segal doing a lot of stuff that he wouldn't be possibly able to do, but it is still better than watching orlando bloom or somebody ripping guys apart.The story like I said is actually pretty good and a touching story with an old man and segal working on a nice lady's stairs makes this superior to most martial arts type movies story-lines. Not that I would call this a real kungfu movie or nothing, it plays a little more like a REAL amrican version of a jackie chan style movie, just a lot more drama.Good explosions, good car chase, and some quality stephen segal action. If you thought exit wounds was decent at all, you will like this."
3,A rather boring Seagal movie,"There is hardly any action in this movie. And for a Steven Seagal movie such a crime is, quite frankly, unforgivable. Although he does try to stretch his range and attempt a little bit of light love scenes with Marg Helgenberger's character.Something I find rather unrealistic about this film is the fact that Seagal walks around, in the sweaty hicktowns of Appalachia, in a large leather jacket that is fully fastened all the way up. Not only would anyone in real life melt in such a garment it would also severely limit their physical dexterity.The plot is basically identical toOn Deadly Ground. Some balony about Seagal not liking Kris Kristopherson (doing the same role as Michael Cane) dumping nuclear waste in old mines...but hey it has to be dumped somewhere and dump this movie with it. For hardcore Seagal fans only.The DVD is in pretty cool Dolby 5.1 and is anamorphically enhanced at 1.78:1 instead of the theatrical 1.85:1."
3,Not a standout,"As far as Steven Seagal movies go, Fire Down Below is probably about in the middle. It is not nearly as comical as Marked for Death or On Deadly Ground, but it is far more exciting than The Patriot. Once again, Seagal shows us that polluting is bad through his portrayal of an EPA agent who is ready to maim a corporate executive and his minions. Scenes that have no real importance to the movie include Seagal remembering his deceased friend at the beginning of the movie and Seagal accidentally coming across some angry farmers and their marijuana field. To his credit, Steven did write and perform one of the songs on the soundtrack for the movie, which acts as added comedy. I guess if I was pressed to give someone a reason to see Fire Down Below, it would be because there are a few cameo appearances by some famous country music stars, but I don't know who they are because I'm not into that kind of thing."
3,Fire Down Below,"Steven Segal is great in this movie, but you can buy this movie at Wal Mart for 5.88 on DVD not 14.98 Amazons price. FRED"
2,Slimfast Down Below,"Instead on investigating who is polluting the mountains, Seagal should investigate an effective weight loss program. Down south in the heat and the guy is bundled in massive leather coats! And notice the quick cut before we can see a profile of hime in a tight shirt. I think he had twins during the production of this one. His next film contract should stipulate that he must limit himself at the all-you-can-eat buffet."
2,Lousy.,"Not what I expect from a Steven Seagal film.I've gone off him recently ,since he has'nt made a good film since Under Siege 1. Too slow and sombre to entertain,playing a charecter too annoying to root for.Laboured,predictable action scenes,including a pathetic scene involving a monster truck going crashing down a hill."
3,The Last Hurrah of Steven Seagal,"This movie was Steven's last really good flick. It really isn't his best , but after ""On Deadly Ground"" it sure is better , and much better than his later movies. How many EPA workers carry guns , break bones , know kung-fu , and play guitar, I don't know but in this movie a least one does. It's the same thing as in all his other movies but at least he is still fit here."
4,There seems to be a pattern...,"It would seem that there seems to be a pattern developing here. I think Segal might be an environmentalist. Although I couldn't agree more with the posistion his movies seem to take on the care of our environment, I am not sure this is the route Segal's movie career should be taking if he wants to continue to enjoy success. For the reson that this type of movie and Segal seem to be getting repetitive I have only rated this film a 4 star production.The acting and cast were excellent, and the story line dealt with something that could be going on in today's society, but I truly hope not."
2,THIS WAS WHERE SEAGAL STARTED TO SLOW DOWN,"AN EPA AGENT [STEVEN SEAGAL] GOES TO APPALACHIA IN AN EFFORT TO STOP SOME ILLEGAL TOXIC WASTE DUMPING. MOST OF THIS MOVIE IS POINTLESS. AS ALWAYS, SEAGAL IS THE HERO THAT OUTSMARTS THE VILLAINS EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. THE THING THAT ALMOST KILLED THIS MOVIE ENTIRELY IS ITS CORNY FIRST HOUR. BUT, IN THE SECOND HOUR, THINGS DO TEND TO GET A LOT BETTER. THIS IS WHERE SEAGAL BEGAN TO LOSE MOMENTUM. BUT, THIS AIN'T AS BAD AS SOME OF SEAGAL'S LATER MOVIES. THIS DEFINITELY AIN'T WORTH BUYING. BUT, IF YOU WANNA SEE THIS MOVIE, RENT IT OR WAIT FOR IT TO COME ON TV."
3,ACTION PACKED!!!!!!!!!!,"It has tons of blood and gore which makes it a real action.Stephen played the best part. If you like action, this is your movie."
5,Good Book,"I wanted to read a different translation of the Psalms to clarify some of the wording that is in the KJV, so far so good."
4,DVD-LEEEECIOUS!,"The Ellen DeGenerous show has long been marked as one of the best and most favorite talk show amongst people worldwide. DVD-licious encapsulates some of the best and favorite and fun moments on the show, giving those who fell in love with this show later in its seasons (like me!) to watch what made this show so successful and what made Ellen so well-loved.DVD-licious is fun, exciting and since it's all captured in a nutshell, you only get to watch the good episodes and the ones that keep you laughing and going for hours.WORTH IT ALL!"
5,A must if you're a fan of Ellen,"If you like Ellen Degeneres and her kind of humour, you have to get this dvd. It's really funny and gave me a quite a few laughs. The only downside I can think of is that it's too short. After three seasons they should have so much more to show, but I still love it."
5,DVD,I received my order in a timely fashion and it was not damaged in anyway. I hope to use this seller again.
5,A fine historian,"Eric Linklater was arguably Scotland's finest historian of the last century (the 20th). In this book, Linklater not only traces the journey of the ""wanderings"" but places the land and the culture in a greater perspective. What is particularly appealing about this work is his examination of the people of the Highlands and Islands who risked their lives and turned away a great fortune to shelter and protect a leader whom many of them knew was championing a losing cause. Linklater puts this steadfastly loyal Highland character in historical and cultural context in a way that other writers have not. The fine writing is accompanied by stunning photographs which together create an evocative and deeply moving book."
5,classic for relaxation and quiet mood,I use this as a mood track for doing Reiki sessions and stretching classes. My clients find it soothing and calming.
5,"Beautiful, soulful mood music that stirs the spirt","I absolutely love this CD. It is deep mood music that reminds me of thick foggy islands where mystical things are happening and where the spirit world reigns. The CD is written in honor of the Standing Stones at Callanish, in Scotland, and it truly represents these images. I highly recommend the CD. Do not expect high energy--this is music for deep contemplation and centering."
3,They work great but the foot pocket brakes pretty fast,"Just as my tittle suggests, the pockets on these fins brake after some use. For some people it could be one month, for some others about 4 months. All the swimmers in my Masters group have experienced the same problem."
2,"Work well, but wear out way too fast.","I found these fins to be relatively comfortable and effective, but the footbox ripped near the big toe after less than one season of use."
4,Good Training Fins,"I used these fins 5 days a week for about a half of my workout, so about a half mile of swimming, for a year straight. Good fit. Good propulsion and leg workout. The rubber does tear after about a year. Otherwise great."
2,Nice fins but just last few months,These fins are nice but I don't recommend them due to tear at the corners on top. If you buy them use super glue to prevent tearing along the top of the foot!
1,Delivered Used,"The fins came in looking like they had already been worn and returned. Furthermore, the rubber seems a bit abrasive and sticky."
2,Foot cup rips after only 2 months of use-poor quality,"I am on a masters swim team and swim about 3 times a week. I LOVE these fins. They are excellent except they are breaking already. After only 2 months of use the foot cup is ripping. I tried to crazy glue it but it didn't work. Now I am swimming with duct tape on the fins. They slowly rip more and more. Amazon says that they are guaranteed for 6 months. I am sending them back, you only get a partial refund and have to pay shipping for a manufacturer's defect. I wish I had listened to the other people who complained about this problem."
2,watch the size you order,I have a size 10 foot and ordered the large. Needless to say they are way small and barely go on my feet which causes cramps as I swim. The supplier needs to convert sizes of fins to shoe sizes much better or warn you to order one size larger. Otherwise the quality is good and would recommend for lap swimming and training.
2,Not a good fit for narrow feet,"Purchased size 7-9 fins for my tall 12 year old boy, size 8.5 mens shoe. Six years of swimming and we decided to try this brand. Fit is too wide and loose for him. May work for an adult, but we are switching back to TYR."
5,Teach Yourself SolidWorks,"I've received a lot of training in the last 12 months on several CAD programs, including SolidWorks Essentials and Advanced courses taught by Mr. Paul Tran. My colleagues and I are agreed that Paul's books and his training courses outshined all others by far.Although the book covers many topics but the Sheet-Metal and Top-Down assembly sections alone had helped me tremendously. My money is well spent. I would recommend this wonderful book to everyone."
5,Teach yourself SolidWorks,This is an excellent guide to learning SolidWorks efficiently. The exercizes were interesting and challenging. They touched on each of the important features in a practical application approach that is easy to understand. I would recommend this book to those new to engineering as well as seasoned professionals.
1,Not a Reference book or a Training Book,This is not a very good training manual or reference book... The book presents an OK foundation for beginner with no intermediate or advance level information. I would not recommend this book unless you are a beginner and have not taken any of the SolidWork classes.
2,Are there any good Books on SolidWorks?,"I am an engineering professor and a professional CSWP user. I read the reviews on this book. I purchased the book based on the reviews. I would not recommend this book for advance users or intermediate users. The author spends too much time on the basics and information that is covered through the SolidWorks Training Manuals. This book would make a good training manual if you do not already have the SolidWorks Manuals, I DO! It does not make a good reference manual."
3,Why The Hatchet Job?,"Yes, I owned the original LP of the same name. Yes, virtually all of it is here on this sumptuously remastered album. But, and for me it's a big but, it's missing something. The original album featured two ""pop"" songs: their mix of Chinese melodies and western lite-jazz-rock arrangements winning and eye-opening. Both tracks featured great drumming and fine improvisational fun. Yet, inexplicably, both cuts are missing from this reissue. Why? Is it because they didn't fit in with the more traditional fare on this album? Whatever the reason, I feel this isn't the same great album I heard back in the early eighties. Oh, don't get me wrong, Horn is in superb form here and the recording is beautiful, lush, ""exotic""...it remains the best single set of Chinese music you could buy if you only wanted one. But, the absence of both cuts cost my review one star apiece. Here's hoping the label will somehow make ammends (but don't count on it)."
2,It was nice...,"until it broke. I don't think this buckle was meant to actually be worn. The little tab you put into the belt hole broke off soon after use. We had someone solder it back on, but it didn't work. As far as looks, it's nice. All Cowboy fans would love it. Just don't plan on using it."
2,Does anyone knows how to clean this fan?,There's a 1000 screws on the the whole thing and haven't found a way to clean it.
1,JUNK!!!! JUNK!!!!,This fan never worked from the time i took it out of the box will not osculate just clicks.JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK.
3,Good but makes scratchy sound.,This is a nice product. I got all the features (with ionization...have no clue what that means) for a pretty decent price. The remote is awesome..so convinient. But after a few days it started making scratchy noises while rotating. havent really looked at the problem yet. My cousin got the same product but he has no such complaints. probably a bad piece.
1,BROKEN!,"Worked fine until after three weeks. It broke-just shorted out and wouldn't come back on. I can't find the ""apparent"" 5-year warranty."
2,5/2007-6/2008 Died after 1 year 1month.,"BEWARE that it only work for few months, since i only used it on summer. Life :5/2007-6/2008, piece of junk now, 1 yr warranty expired. when it is working, it is pretty nice."
4,"Low is a bit weak, but great fan nonetheless","This fan was a great deal at $20 from Amazon's Friday sale- it's powerful on high but a bit weak when on low, which is probably how it's virtually silent. I really like the temperature display and the remote- if it goes on sale again, I'm getting another one."
2,Not worth it,"I was disappointed with this fan. I have a similar type fan (Lasko) which I like very much, but this one does not seem to be as sturdy. I really don't like the remote. I think a remote should fit comfortably in the hand and operate easily with one hand. This one is oddly shaped and difficult to hold in one hand and operate while pointed at the fan. I also thought a flashlight on the remote would be good, but the light only stays on while holding the button down and with this remote, it is very awkward. The fan works, but I definitely would not buy another one."
1,broke after only a few hours JUNK!,"This product stopped working after the first few hours. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I wanted to exchange it for a new one but I was told that they are no longer available and I can only get a refund. Thank you amazon for your excellent return policy, but I wanted a replacement. The $19.99 price was so good. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Not as good as an old fashioned table fan,I had no mechanical glitches like others have said. But it does not chill the room like others said..I have an old fashioned table fan. I would rate this fans performance to be almost the same as that fan..Idont believe that it can reduce the temperature of the room by even 4 degree in a hot summer when the temperature is as high as 90+Very disappointed..running my A.C and my table fan now..this just looks good and stylish..but i doubt the performance..
2,Mediocre performance - good price,"For the money, this is a good fan; but don't expect to be wowed by the features or performance.Here are the observations I have made so far:* The oscillation on this fan only works 50% of the time.* Fan can be very quiet with good airflow.* Thermostat is very innacurate - probably 5 degrees off.* The breeze mode is great at night - it is very quiet and quite pleasant when sleeping.* The remote control is kind of a gimmick - it is not practical.Overall I am satisfied with the purchase and the product - but it was purely based on pricepoint... if it had been even $10 more expensive I would have been unhappy. In this case I got what I paid for."
3,was good till it worked,I got this on May 10th. It quit working on june 1st. I have contacted the company. Let's see how it goes!
1,This guy literally sent the wrong memory,"This guy literally sent the wrong memory, Not good. It physically would not fit in my IBM laptop. (I worked for IBM for 5 years so I know my memory!) I live outside of the country so it was not worth sending it back. Additionally, he just couldn't believe he had made a mistake but did send return labels. I guess we all make mistakes, sometimes it hard to tell the difference between 200 pin and 266 pin memory."
5,No problems with purchase,All the modules are working fine. No problems with purchase. Just what I needed. Happy with product. I would buy again.
2,Be more specific...,"I received these items in a very timely manner, anxious to get them installed on my truck. Low and behold, when I took them out of the box, it was clearly marked on the item that they are not to be used on GMC or Dodge trucks. Well, of course I have a GMC. The seller was very responsive in facilitating the return of the items but could have been more specific about what vehicles they are to be used on. ""Fits most trucks"" just doesn't cut it. The worst part is that I think I spent more on shipping than I did for the anchors.Seller seems to be top-notch as far as response, just needs to be more specific."
2,how to size stake pocket anchors for Chevy truck stake pockets,"I received an NMMO mount antenna base with similar dimensions to this one. It was 2"" x 1"" rubber block whereas a Chevy Silverado 2500 has 2 5/8"" x 1 3/4"" stake pocket receptacles. I remedied this by taking hard rubber glazing blocks using for installing 74"" patio door replacement windows and cutting them down to increase the outside dimensions of the stake pocket anchor block. I sanded both the glazing block pieces (can be cut to size with a sharp knife) and the stake pocket block and glued them with DAP rubber contact cement. The glazing blocks are 1/4"" thick (actually 7/32"" really) and I did one layer all around and a second piece on one side of the long axis. Home Depot does not have these glazing blocks, I obtained them from a local glass shop. Now the stake pocket anchor slides snugly into the Chevy Stake Pocket hole and only a few turns of the wrench tightens it and it's very tight."
2,Not for me,"Others may enjoy this product more than me, but I thought that it was too tough and chewy. Buffalo Bill's have great products so I am blaming this one on conflict of taste."
3,Lacking,"SUMMARY:The idea behind these jerky shots is to give you a bite size easy to carry jerky snack and in the aspect it seems to perform ok. You get a lot of meat in each bag (though you go through it quickly). I was very dissapointed with taste and texture of the meat. The taste was very flat, almost waxy in nature. The texture can only be described as slightly greasy.PROS:-Lots of bang for your buck.-Bite Size Shape wont wear out your jaw.CONS:-Unsatisfactory flavor and texture.OVERALL:All in all its a decent buy, and I would probably buy it again when I need an easily accesible snack that I can take with me. But the lack of bold flavor and the greasy texture make this far from being one of my favorites."
1,Disappointed,"This was my 1st Buffalo Bills product. Normally I purchard the Tillamuck jerky shots, but Buffalo Bills was a bit cheaper and didn't come in a giant plastic container. I was very disappointed in these Buffalo Bill shots. They taste different, I can't quite figure it out other than it doesn't taste like the jerky shots I am used to. Maybe they are too sweet I'm not sure. I will say they were shipped quickly, so I would buy something from Choo Choo again. Just not this jerky."
4,I wish there was more...,"While Delibes' score is treated well in this CD, its marvelous execution leave me wanting. The orchestration is wonderful, and the movements are artfully conducted. The problem is that there are a full 10 sections of the score that are missing from this offering. Considering the quality of this recording, it is a pity."
5,The best thing for a humidor.,If you have ever had to constantly keep tabs on your hygrometer and add more water or try to dry it out then this product is for you. It is so easy it's unbelievable.If you have a humidor then you need this product. It really makes life so much more simple.
3,Ours were not as good as advertised...,"These were supposed to be the end all be all to address humidity concerns, but that was not the case. Ours were kind of effective, but we turned around and immediately started looking for a different option. Other option seems to be a working much better, but if it seems like a great fit you for, give them a shot. Maybe we just got 3 bad packs..."
1,Just didn't work...,"I bought these for my humidor, and they didn't work at all. It was already seasoned, and I previously used gel humidifiers and figured I would give these a try because the reviews led me to believe they were effortless. Now I will have to re-season my humidor. I kept my humidor around 69-70% humidity with gel humidifiers. When I took my last gel humidifier out, my humidity was at 65%. Then I put two packets, which is recommended for 0-50 cigars, in my humidor. One was a 69% packet, and the other was a 72% packet. The humidity dropped to 58%, and hovers around 60%, but never gets above that. I only keep around 10 cigars in there at a time also, so too many cigars is not the case. I'm not really sure what went wrong, but I followed directions and read advice online, and they just don't seem to work. I will be going back to distilled water and gel or sponge humidifiers, since they always work."
5,So Easy To Use,Works great as confirmed by my hygrometer. So simple to use. Works great to maintain moisture for herbal products. Have also used to re-moisturize herbal supplements.
3,Worked well at first,"For the first few weeks or so it worked very well, where the humidity was consistently between 60-70%, depending on how often I opened it. However, it pretty much just completely crapped out after about a month of use, where I was barely opening my humidor. I'm not entirely convinced this is not a good product, so I'm assuming I just got a bad one. I will try the other one's I bought soon to see if they have the same problems."
5,Need encouragement? Read this book!,"YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES is the most encouraging book I've read in years. It literally changed my life. Especially helpful were the chapters on celebrating your passion and finding your path. Applying what I've learned from this book has helped me focus on what's right for me. The chapter on celebrating your personality was great, too, as it included a personality definition tool. Littauer has also included a vast bibliography for follow-up."
1,Maybe as a gift for your pet,"This CD is one of the worst things that I ever heard, it is a kind of music that only your pet will like. And I am not exagerating, believe me."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased these struts for a 2003 Accord due to age and millage. Big mistake...these shocks make my Honda handle like a waterbed. They bounce and sway side to side. My original shocks handled 10 times better. They make this horrible creaking noise like if you were jumping on a bed. I even had the bushings changed and other applicable components. Long story short...spend the money and go either KYB or OEM. As I think I may have a defective pair of shocks, they are unfortunately out of the return date as it took me a while to get around to getting them replaced. It's not the fact that they are defective as things happen, it's just not cheap and easy to replace struts if you are not doing them yourself. Then again your time is not cheap and abundant either. You get what you pay for!!! Lesson learned yet again."
1,Dead after 2 years,"I bought this router brand new from Best Buy and it lasted just past the factory warranty. Then it decided to go completely dead. No lights come on, it just stopped working for no reason. Technical support was kind enough to inform me that they would do nothing and I'm stuck with a dead unit. Thanks Netgear for your quality product! Never buying their junk again."
5,works great with DDWRT !!,"Works great with DD-WRT, and easy to install too. Don't know how it works with factory firmware though. I'd say the only con is that it has a pretty big footprint for a router, but it's not huge by any means."
3,Timer works as expected; a bit pricey for what it is,"I purchased this timer to control an air conditioner that I installed in my garage. The air conditioner has its own thermostat, but no day to day clock.Installation could not have been any simpler. The timer simply plugs into the wall outlet, and then the air conditioner cord plugs into the side of the timer. The timer has a standard, 3-prong, 20A, 240V plug and outlet.The timer works as expected -- the on and off times are set using the familiar plastic tabs that one often sees elsewhere (on landscape light transformers, water heater timers, etc.).You may not want to use this plug in or next to a bedroom as the mechanical clock's ticking noise is loud.For this price, I expected to be able to find a 7-day schedule timer (digital or mechanical), rather than this same-schedule-each-day unit. But I searched and did not find much of a selection among low cost, 240 volt timers."
3,60 Hz Appliance Timer,"Delivery was on time. Product is as expected, and is operating well. Really needed a 50 Hz but couldn't find one, hence the actual time duration has to be adjusted by ~ 10% when setting a start time."
4,Intermatic 220 timer,"Easy to set up and use.I have window unit air conditioners,with a 220 unit in the living room.I can set this to run it for a couple of hours in the afternoon when I'm out of town or if I've been out at the beach all day or out on my bike.During the summer it's nice to come home to a cool house.No problems or complaints so far.Very happy with purchase."
1,not for usa,"cant plug it in! this is for England or france,,, so who knows if it works! go to your hardware store before they send you the wrong one!"
1,Sour Mash,"Schaap, who worked under Jimmy Breslin and Roger Kahn, could write with neither but he hustled better than either. His credentials: ghost writng and tv pap, sometimes nasty. Stout's work is about as big league as the home town he lists, Uxbridge, Mass. Anyone can pick a couple, three nice pieces, but this should not be done by these fellers. They are semi-qualified, too much on the make. Replace them with, say Bill Dwyre, the great Sports Editor of the LA Times, and John Cherwa, exec sports editor of the Chicago Tribune and Pete Carrey, of SI. Personally -- I am a clinical shrink who loves sports -- I wish professional standards were applied to any collection called best."
4,Still a fun book,"I was expecting the same one I had as a child and purchased in the '80's. This one was half the size. A lot of the pages are printed only on one side because they are cut-outs so I feel a lot is missing. I am a little disappointed that it isn't the big book. I have one of the older ones but a lot of the pages are colored and I teach now. I wanted to be able to make copies for the kids but not of things I have colored. At least all the calendars are in there and there is something for every holiday (I think). Still, I am very happy to have this one to make copies from. As always, Richard Scarry is lots of fun."
5,History repeats itself!,Twenty-eight years ago I recieved this book for Christmas. On a whim I checked to see if it was still available and I was SO happy to find out it is! My daughter loves it as much as I did when I was a child!
3,Bug shield with bugs,"The hood shield looks good and was an easy install on my 03 Chevy 1500. The problem is in the air flow. The shield makes the rubber trim on both sides of the front window vibrate. The noise is pretty annoying. I called the manufacture and they instructed me to put 1/2"" 3M double sided tape between the windshield & trim. This stopped the noise, but cost me an additional $5.57."
3,great but high,I used to get these at the dollar tree for a dollar a carton. Milk tastes great as long as it is cold. I just can not believe this price. It is good for anyone who can not run to store every time they run out of milk. Great for trips as you do not have to keep in fridge until you need it.
2,"New Mom Says ""Thumbs Down""","I am really disappointed with this book. It's packed full of broadly presented and common-sense information. Most of the advice the book recommends will come very natural to you. I've read 150 pages so far and haven't really learned anything. It's also divided by subject, not age, which results in the book approaching subjects very broadly. It often gives the same advice for 1 and 3 year-olds, and anyone who has ever been around these ages understands that this is not practical. A 1 year-old is barely off the bottle, can't communicate well, isn't potty-trained, and is barely learning to hold a spoon! Instead, I recommend other book, which offers a month-by-month guide -""What to Expect the Toddler Years"" for more detailed info on illnesses, developmental milestones, nutrititional guidance, etc."
3,"so, so","I LOVED the Parenting Guide to Your INFANT, so I HAD to get this one. It is OK, but I don't care for it quite as much as I did the INFANT book. The ""Parenting Guide to Your INFANT"" will definitely be on my list for any baby showers I am invited to in the future.Maybe I'll find this one to be better once my little lady gets older...?"
2,Common Sense,This book was very vague. Most of it seemed more like common sense to me and I'm a first time parent. I wanted a more information based on age or development then a broad overview. It seemed to lump large age groups together. I read it once and never referred back to it. I was greatly disapointed.
1,Not worth it,I have been trying to lose my baby weight. I've had 2 kids in the past 2 years so I have added on a big extra and now want to get rid of it. It's not easy especially with the 2 little ones. I do go to they gym or go on my speed walks but it's not everyday. So I figured I'd get some help from Accelis. It was like taking an empty pill. It did nothing. No side effects but nothing else either. Not recommeded.I am however taking Burn 60 by GNC. This has really helped curve my hunger and cravings.
3,Maybe good for an extra pound off a week.,"I started my diet and then started taking these. I seem to be a bit less hungry during the day and these pills may have helped me lose a pound or so here and there but I have been strictly dieting, hardly any fat, and the pounds are coming off very slowly! So if you are looking for fast results, these don't work very well!"
2,I'm soorry about this item. This item didn't work for me. I wasted my money.,I'm soorry about this item. This item didn't work for me.I wasted my money.Accelis (40 caps) Extreme Weight Loss ***FAST SHIP***
4,Dakota opera glasses,"The glasses i ordered were sold as a used item but other than not being in a box, they were in perfect condition. I am not an avid opera fan so these glasses were used more as a novelty item then anything else, however I did enjoy using them and got them for a bargain price!"
2,Camp Burlesque left me bored and homesick...,"I am a HUGE Burlesque revival fan, and was elated upon finding this Dvd (and the accompanying book). However, the production values are very, very low, and the narration is intrusive and boring. The entire Dvd is around 30 minutes total--so short, with little explanation as to how or WHY it was made! Some of the filmed segments seem to be quite funny, but almost none of them have the original sound, just the dull narrator. Just as you are getting interested, or just annoyed, the movie is over. Really just an amateurish short film on a shoe-string budget. The only reason to buy this movie is to see Erochica Bamboo and Kitten DeVille--otherwise, just take a trip to the Miss Exotic World Pageant in Helendale next June--you'll see more camp AND more Burlesque!!!"
2,"I really wanted to like this, but I didn't.","The narration was not my favorite. And I wasn't sure if I was relieved or annoyed that the run time was a scant 29 minutes. But, like the other reviewer, I did enjoy Erochica Bamboo and Kitten DeVille. I love burlesque and I really wanted to like this, but I didn't."
3,"Glossy, inspiring images, thin text","I really liked this book. Although thin on written content, it has 96 glossy pages of beautifully designed web sites. This book gives me relief from creative blocks, and I find it a good index of a few URLs to visit and test for myself. Some useful tips on colour are present, but it's really a visual reference rather than anything overly informative. Good value for the low price."
3,Don't buy them all,"I was foolish enough to have bought their ""...: Color"" and ""...: Navigation"" at the same time. What a big mistake. The authors even had the audacity to use many of the same examples in *both* books! There is no way I'm going to try their Typography"" one. I hate being cheated. Buy them used (and thus at a much lower price) if you must buy them at all. They might be a little helpful if you are suffering from a creative block. They weren't helpful for me, but I'm already artistic so maybe that's why."
2,super fitted!,"I had to return this size 6 unitard since it was extremely tight. I teach water fitness classes and realized that I couldn't rotate my arms 100 percent because it was tight around the shoulders, the legs... Unfortunately they didn't have the next size up, but I would advise someone buying this garment, to order bigger then you would expect."
3,"great dirt bike use, but fragile","A very accurate gauge. It worked awesome before I broke it. I must have dropped it or something. I took it apart and there is some pretty lightweight and delicate clockwork in there. I fixed it then the needle locked up on me. I fixed it again but I think the needle was off a few teeth on the sprocket making it inaccurate. If you are careful with your tools, I've never seen a better gauge. This is not something you can throw in your toolbox and expect to work after taking a beating. It was such an accurate gauge, I am thinking of buying a replacement and being much more careful with it."
5,Works great,I have an x2 Segway. The tires require 4 lbs pressure. This gauge works just great. Regular tire gauges wont go that low.
5,Saves your thumb! A must have!,"I use this with Ruger 22/45 magazines. You might think this thing really isn't necessary since there's a little button on the side you hold with your thumb to slide the spring down. But after firing 100s of rounds (and each mag only holding 10), your thumb will be sore. This speedloader great since you don't have to hold the button. Plus this thing actually locks itself in to place so you don't have to hold it down, even though it says in the description you have to hold it down by hand. It might be because mine is still new, or maybe just because of the design of the 22/45 magazine. Still, it beats holding on to the little button!"
4,very Handy product,"Very Handy device, easy to carry saved a lot of time loading my Mark III Hunter Mags.i recommend this product. no soar fingers after 100-200 shots days at a range."
2,No love for this,"I'm surprised at how many glowing reviews this product gets! I've had one for several months and do not like it. The concept is right, it's the implementation of it that's flawed. Yes, it'll hold the tension down so your thumb doesn't have to suffer the pain, but it hugs the magazine so snuggly that I found it difficult to use. I also found the hook at the bottom to be more hinderance than help. If you want to slide the speedloader down the magazine as you load, the hook adds unwanted resistance. But if you instead slide the speedloader all the way down and latch it to the bottom of the mag before loading, bullets end up dropping in every which way. If you want a better designed product, check out the Brass Stacker brand (I recently got one and it works much better)."
4,"Not the best speed loader, but worth having","I have anUltimate Clip Loaderwhich is my preferred speed loader, but it doesn't work well with ammo that has too much wax on it from the factory. This is a great item to keep in the range bag as a fallback, much better than beating up your thumbs loading your MkIII's mags."
4,Simple,"Works well and made from a rather thick polymer so it should last awhile, could be better priced however considering that it is just a chunk of molded plastic."
5,Interesting and fantastic...,"I borrowed this book from my school library, and it was interesting and fascinating. Enough so that I wanted to search for other books in this series! When I find the price of these other books, I will report on them!"
5,Worth the read,I first read this book in high school. It was even better reading it as an adult. I enjoyed the whole series.
4,Like heater,it works great in my golf carts. I purchased 2 golf carts for my cemetery rather than buy trucks. The heaters work well with the enclosures for winter months.
5,Great little unit,"I got this to warm up a small tent trailer. Having read about the oils that need to be burned off to avoid the fumes later, I set it in my two car garage to run. Let it go for about 45 min and it warmed the garage right up. I think this will work fine for our purposes. I'll update after a ""cold"" camping trip.Also wanted to echo another review, the control know feels like it's loose but is not or at least cannot be further tightened without adding a washer or the like. Works fine as is though. No complaints."
3,Stay close the the heater...,As a view reviews mentioned the heat-output is not too great.It works but for a bigger room or tent it is not warm enough - especially in Michigan climate.I would recommend for small tent (max 2 Person) or milder climate.
3,ok i guess,everything here works except i broke the leg the moment it came out the box....what a dorky leg. i rigged it up to work though- eh whatever.
2,Little tent heater,This heater works well but could not heat my large tent. It put out heat but my tent is 10X16 feet and made of nylon. The heat was not retained in the tent.
2,Didnt even heat a 9 ft x 7 ft tent,After reading several reviews I wanted to try this heater for my camping trip. I tried it inside a 9 ft x 7 ft 4 person tent. The temperature did not change even after keeping it on for hours.
1,To hot to handle.,I was looking for a heater to set up in my tent for those really cold camping nights and what I purchased was a heater that is flimsy and unsafe. One of the legs gave out fter leaving it on for about 30 min. It fell over burning a hole in my air mattress. Worst camping purchase I have ever made.
1,Not safe for golf cart,The item s returned immediately. Not safe for use in golf cart! Oth items returned and only got credit for one.Items returned in same container I received the heaters.
4,Coleman Black Cat propane heater,Nice little unit for my camper for chilly nights. Worked well first time I fired it up and heat was adequate. Leave a window vented of course. Coleman could have beefed up those little ears to stop the legs in place: I can see how they could easily be broken off if you turn the legs in the wrong direction. BE CAREFUL TWISTING THE LEGS INTO PLACE EVERY TIME YOU USE THE UNIT!!!!THE ears WILL break off!!!!THINK!!!
4,Power Package,"This little guy opens up the can of gas to all its potential! It is quiet, warm, and easy to use. With the catalytic element I feel safe to have this in a tent with my kids. It warmed up a 12x12 room in just 15 minutes. I am sure it will be warm enough to keep the frost from forming on the inside of the tent for this years fall scouting camp-out..."
3,Good except when its COLD,This well made unit only pumps out 3000btu. In my opinion that's not enough heat to really make a difference when winter camping. I live in Georgia and camp in a larger insulated hightop van. I seldom camp if the temps are below 40 at night. This unit will cut the chill as they say but really wont make you comfortable.I also found that running the heater on low will drain the one pound canisters in less than 8 hours. I'd say 6 hours.My other complaint is that you cannot hook this heater up to a 20# tank so your always tied to the little canisters. If you can live with this and the lower heat output then its a fine heater.
2,gets very very hot on the edges!!,This seemed like a good idea to heat the back of my truck for my dogs but it gets very very hot around the metal lip. not safe. not easy to light up.
3,Wasn't too thrilled,"I bought this to take on a camping trip. It was 27 degrees and I only used it at night to go to sleep. It turned off on me several times, even with a new propane tank. Very disappointing."
5,very happy,im very happy with this product when the power goes out so dose my heat so this keeps my family nice and warm
1,adjustable arms break too easily!,product has potential if coleman can fix the flimsy plastic arms that hold the device together. out of the box one of the plastic clips was broken and I returned the product to go with a Mr. Heat heater (which is awesome).
4,This is our backup - but we haven't needed it yet,I bought 2 thinking that one might not work or they might not last the whole season - but the other has been so great that we haven't had to use it yet.
5,kept us warm during a 6 day power outage,"This is a great little heater. It warms up quickly, and turns off if bumped. This model does NOT have an built in ignition source. You have to hold a match or lighter in front of the unit to light. Not a big deal, but it made the wife a little uneasy."
4,Good book for an unknown author,"Having been to the Philippines probably made this book even more interesting. However, the author gives some pretty good descriptions of life in The Philippines. Well written and a good page turner. Definitely an author with potential."
2,Poozies without Kate Rusby,"The Chantoozies CD and the Dansoozies CD is the Poozies in the mid 1990's before Kate Rusby joined the group. The group included:KAREN TWEED Piano accordion, percussion, vocalsPATSY SEDDON Electro-harp, gut-strung harp, fiddle, percussion, vocalsEILIDH SHAW Guitar, fiddle, percussion, vocalsMARY MACMASTER Electro-harp, metal-strung harp, percussion, vocalsMost of the good songs on the Chantoozies CD and the Dansoozies CD can be found on the Infinate Blue CD which also includes music from the Come Raise Your Head EP which had Kate Rusby in the line up.I suggest you buy the Infinate Blue CD (which includes a few songs from this CD and some additional songs with Kate Rusby) to see if you like the music from this CD. The Poozies have a very different vocal sound without Kate Rusby; which may or may not be to your liking.I am not a big Celtic Gaelic fan so might rate it lower than some who love this tradition."
3,Durability questionable.,"Its a cute stuffed animal, looks exactly as pictured. As other reviewers mentioned the fabric is soft. However when I received the stuffed animal there was already a hole in the seam opening up. Rather than go through the return/exchange process I just sowed it up. So far we've had it about a month and he's holding up fine. However the seams don't appear to be very durable. Since its a gift for my wife he doesn't get much action however I don't really expect the monkey to last more than a year before he's spilling stuffing."
4,happy cats,"I bought 2 of these korner kombers to replace the 1 I had from many years ago. We just had the house painted and as soon as the paint was dry, these went on. My 2 cats were in HEAVEN!!"
1,"good seller, not good product","There was nothing I could do to get these to stick on the walls.Therefore useless. The cats were attracted to them, but they would fall off the wall before they even got to them."
1,Waste of money,It won't stick to the wall even when I put heavy duty stickys on it. The plastic that holds the two sections together is too stiff so it won't stay bent thus pulling it from the wall.
4,My cats love it,"These work very well except the material to fasten to the wall would not stick. Once I bought different fasteners, they worked great."
1,Did not stay on wall.,This product would not stay on the wall even before my cats tried to use it. Not worth the money.
2,Here Kitty Kitty Kitty,The cat loves this. I had to screw it on the wall so the cat wouldn't rub it off again...
2,ok but,This item seemed good at first but it doesn't stick to anything so j ended up nailing it to a wooden bin that my cat loves to lay next to. She used it the first day but then lost interest as the item kept coming apart.
3,To each his own...,"I have two adult cats who have separate opinions about this product. My male doesn't care for it; he also thinks it looks cheap. So, attach it to an unpopular corner of your house where guests will miss it. On the other hand, my female rubs up against this on a daily basis. Then again, she'll rub up on anything including the screen of my laptop. And she doesn't care if it's in an obscure corner of the house. She'll go the extra mile to visit it."
2,Groom n' Comb,"I like these in general, have had one before. But the brand I got (Groom n' Comb, not the one pictured here) the comb part comes loose when the cat rubs against it. It should be all-in-one."
1,Crappy! Crappy! Crappy!,"Will not stick to the wall - even with duck tape. Also, the containers that hold the catnip keep popping open on their own and spilling the catnip all over the floor."
1,Not so much..,"Well, the idea here is great. But, it just doesnt work. My cats wouldnt get near it, it didnt stay on the wall, and it fell apart all the time :( Threw it away after about 3 weeks."
2,Sentry Groom'n Comb,"The stick-on strips don't work well or last , so I use the top hole to screw it to the corner and then the groomer part doesn't stay where it is supposed to. This isn't the one I bought several years ago, where I could just hang the strips."
3,tabs did not stick to the plastic,"The Croom'n Comb came as ordered, but the peel & Stick tabs did not stick to the plastic. I bought two sided tape and put it all over the parimiter, so I got it to work, but feel that the tabs should have stuck. It is a great idea and the cats love the comb. I couldn't find a glue that would stick to the plastic.Don"
3,cat corner,I could not get the tape to stick and keep the product on the wall. I finally used screws to attach the frame to the wall.
5,hopeful,It is a wonderful concept. Just received two days now so not as much activity yet. Kitties are curious and love to groom however so it will be a hit.
3,"Could be better, but both cats like it.","First off, the adhesive strips on this are laughable. They don't stick for anything, so as long as you don't mind having to use alternate forms of attachment, go ahead and get this. It's a cute idea, both my cats instantly started rubbing their faces all over it, and thus, it promptly pulled away from the wall. I am about to dig around for some screws to mount it with. My older cat would always rub his face all over the corner of the hallway and I was constantly cleaning off his mess, so this is nice. BOTH cats enjoy it and it will keep me from having to constantly cleaning kitty grooming smudges off the wall."
1,Most of these reviews must be fake. Not worth it.,"I purchased this wall groomer because it was the only one with decent ""Reviews."" However, this thing is a piece. Immediately taking it out of the package I noticed that the comb panels did not align up to the frame and therefor kept popping off. My cat was excited about it when I held it up to the corner, but as soon as I attached it, the panels kept popping it off (because the parts were not made properly and will not fit and stay in place), then the stickers popped off the wall as well, and yes I prepped the wall properly. This is not a very good quality product."
3,Buy different sticky strips,"The product is a bit flimsy - the inserts aren't really a good fit and seem to move around, but that doesn't bother the cat any. There are little containers to put catnip in (included) but you only need the tiniest amount - in fact, my cat was all over it without adding any because the scent was on it from shipping.You will definitely need to buy different sticky strips -- I used the ones included and it fell off immediately. I purchased the 3M Command small poster strips and used four - works great. You can get a pack of 16 for a few bucks and they should remove easily without marking your walls. I might buy a bunch more Kitty Korner Kombers for other places (as if I could get my cat to rub against only one corner?)"
2,Kitty Korner Komber,It wont stay on the wall. I bought some double sided tape and that didn't work as the original sticky pads wont stay on the product. I'm not sure I should drill holes in the product and mount with screws but it might be the only way to get use out of it.
3,Cats love it - would recommend using stronger double sided tape,For the price you can not go wrong. My Cats love it. I would recommend using double sided sticky tape (command strips) the tape that came with the product did not stick to the walls.
1,Cats never use it - they rub their cheeks on everything else though,"I have four cats; one of them is CONSTANTLY rubbing his cheeks against EVERYTHING - so I mainly purchased this item for him. I placed the Korner Komber in an area the cats frequently walk through, at a height that would be the most comfortable for them - they NEVER, ever use it! I even put some catnip in it - still nothing - even though they love catnip. I'm so surprised they don't like this. I should have returned it, but I was hoping they would eventually come around to using it. Well, I've had it for almost 2 1/2 years now and it still gets no use. I'm glad other people's cats like it."
1,Worthless,"My cat was very excited about this right away and immediately started rubbing his face on it as soon as it came out of the box. However, it did not even stick to the wall for 5 minutes and the part where the comb is detachable (for cleaning) also was not secure to the back. I may try securing it myself, but it really should be more sturdy."
5,My cat uses this EVERYDAY,"so, i say my cat, but i actually have 3 cats. the other two really don't care much for it. I may see one of the others breeze by it in passing, but the cat i speak of, she uses it every single day. she sits there and just rubs back and forth. i haven't put catnip in the pouch since i got one just like it a year ago, so i bought another one to put on another corner, maybe the cats want their own? if there are reviews about it not working or something, just remember if you are a cat owner, you've already discovered...cats are picky :-)"
3,Doesn't stick to wall and has no screw holes,"I felt like this was kind of expensive considering what I paid for one of these several years ago, but I went ahead and ordered it because my cats really enjoyed the similar old one (that accidentally got left in a previous residence). I was disappointed in this manufacturer's model. The plastic seems like it has ""too much movement"" in it and the panels don't snap into the frame well. The enclosed sticky pads aren't strong enough to keep it adhered to the wall (mine fell down within minutes). The enclosed catnip wasn't even fresh. To keep mine on the wall, I took the removable scratchers off, then screwed the frame to the wall, then put the scratchers back on. If you don't have drywall screws, washers, and an electric screwdriver, don't buy this."
2,Sentry HC Groom in Comb with caatnip pouch,"This item was a good idea but did not attach to the corner for long. I followed the directions and placed the item where my cat could use it. She went for it right away and scratched and rubbed her cheeks against it and I thought it was a good item for her. After a few minutes this contraption popped off the wall and scared her. I replaced the adhesive strips from the package with two-sided carpet tape and again this contraption fell off. My cat will no longer go near it. The idea was good but the design was poor. I will try to nail it to the wall and see if that works. If it doesent, it is going in the trash."
2,Kind of hard to stick on the wall,"I think the only problem with this product is that its hard to keep it on the wall. We tried the sticky tape included and it fell off and we went and bought other things and finally used some products that hold really heavy things and that kept it on the wall. Other than that, the instructions are pretty good."
1,Two Paws Down,I was excited to get this based on the many good reviews. I bought this for my 2 yr old cat that loves to groom herself and be groomed. She does not like the brush on the wall or with me brushing her with it. She takes two seconds to get the pannels out of the holder so I would recommend extra methods of securing them. Glad I have it over a hard wood floor since the cat nip gets sprinkled around when she pops the panel out.(The frame pops off the wall too so extra adhesive on the back would be a good idea too.)
3,Good but not as good as the first.,"Mariachi Cobre truly is one of the finest mariachi groups in the world, and this record does them justice as such. However, I am a mariachi purist, and I didn't enjoy some of the more ""Nortena"" sounding songs on this recording, especially where the accordion is involved. I did really enjoy Cobre's renditions of the traditional sons like ""La Madrugada"" and ""Los Copetonas."" This CD is a must have, but do not expect as pure a mariachi sound, but do expect the talent of the musicians to compensate for it."
5,Essential!,"Norwood has written a treatise on how to play the Modern that is like an ""insider's"" guide. He know this opening, its ups and downs (and sideways). Even though it is called ""Winning with,"" it is written objectively. In fact, it starts out with several lengthy chess quotes about he weakness of the king's finachetto. He tells you what to look out for, and teaches you the ideas and strategies for the most common lines. He discusses many important themes: transpositions, counterattack, restraint, and many others. This book has a nice index and is very well written. It is a gripping account of this wonderful defence. I have been so pleased since I tracked down and bought this book."
3,The Modern (Robatsch) Defense,"Provides a wealth of insight into one of the more off-beat schemes of defense for the Black pieces. The system features the moves g6, Bg7, and c6 or d6 for Black, is easy to learn, especially for kids, because the same basic moves can be played by Black against almost any opening played by White. My 8 yr-old son's USCF rating has climbed from 500 to almost 1000 in just 4 months using this system. In my view, it is for Black what such straight-forward openings like the Colle are to White."
3,Coleman Forester Cot,"The cot was light in weight as I expected. The only qualms I have is that the fabric creeks while on it and that a carry handle would be helpful., It was easy to set up, just unfold it."
2,"Looks great, but only worked for a few months","This is a nice looking watch, but if you want a reliable time piece, then this is not the watch for you. It worked great for a few months and then died. I replaced the battery and it still doesn't work right. It will keep time sometimes for a few seconds or even a few hours, but then the hands just stop. I've owned many Timex watches and never had problems like this. I would caution against buying this watch."
3,Probably a nice watch for the $$ but it didn't work,"Out of the box, it didn't work. It was probably just a dead battery, but I don't think I should have to go to a jeweler to have a new battery installed in a brand new watch. So I sent it back."
5,Human resilience and hope,"Love to Water My Soul has become one of my all time favorite books. I recommend it to anyone who asks for a good book idea. Jane Kirkpatrick's writing shows the resilience of a child and as she grows, an adult. It brought me to tears of sadness, but then of joy. There are so many beautifully written scenes in this book, I had to copy them down in my journal to reread...my one surprise is that Hollywood hasn't turned it in to a movie yet!"
3,"Nice story, but a little slow in the beginning","This book tells a very nice story (summarized in other reviews). However, I had some trouble getting started with the book as I found it a little slow in the beginning. I found the writing to be a little bit ""flowery"" and sometimes wished the author was a little more direct. But overall a good book."
3,Remarkably forgettable.,"The book reminded me a lot of ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" because of the detailed descriptions of Native American life and the intricacies of the culture. However, I didn't find myself that concerned with the main character. I was more saddened by what happened to the dog than to her husband. There was something about the author's style of writing and the main character's emotional reserve that left my heart feeling more dry than watered."
4,Love to Water My Soul,I have read several books by this author and believe this to be her best. She respects the cultures she presents without glamorizing them. Her research makes the story instructive and she uses language well to bring her characters to life.
5,My favorite so far,"Two years ago, when I read my first Jane Kirkpatrick novel, it took me several tries to ""get into it"" and care about the story and characters. She is now one of my favorite authors. I have liked some of her books less than the others and even been a bit baffled by one or two. However, this has been my favorite story yet. The history included is made personal to the character and quite fascinating."
2,Book was in horrible condition.,"The item description said the book was in ""pretty good"" condition. When i received it three and a half weeks later it was badly water damaged and almost every page was ripped."
4,Pretty Good,"I bought the CD while at Melissa's recent show in Washington DC. They definitely play better live. I think I prefer Freedom, and most of Willing to Wait to Listen Hard, but there are some really great tracks on this album too. I'm particularly fond of ""Shatter Me."" Some nice slow pieces too."
5,Where Oh Where?,"Majastic,soaring music....I too have heard segments over the Radio(Phx Az) for the past 5/6 years......scoured the Internet all the way to Europe....... no luck. Where can I find This??? any help would be greatly appreciated. Tnx"
3,I didn't enjoy it as much as the first one,"Here were my problems...#1 I really didn't see any chemistry between Hannah and Devlin until the middle/end of the book...I actually thought she had more chemistry with Noah Starr. #2 Devlin was pretty much the exact same character as Conner in the first book. #3 We should have seem more first person memories from Hannah about her past...it would have made her more sympathetic. Characters Hannah would have had a past with like ""Sadie"", other prostitutes, or other men she had ""past dealings"" with weren't part of the story (expect for the main villain).I will eventually read book 3, but I'm really glad its about Evan, who hopefully doesn't have the exact same anger/lack of faith issues as both Conner and Devlin. I will say I really enjoyed book #1 but book 2 seemed like a repeat with a different type of woman."
5,"Powerful, Realistic, Needed in Inspritaional Fiction","I haven't read any of Kathleen Morgan's previous books, but she has brought inspirational fiction a gift. The reference to intimacy as santified in marriage (physical, emotional and spiritual) is acurate and powerful. It's wonderful to read about this in realistic terms although not graphic. Imagination has it's own rewards. The story line is great! The characters seem alive! Keep writing inspirational fiction, Kathleen!"
4,Woman of Grace,"Very good book in the series of Culdee Creek. It is an interesting book set in the 19th century on a ranch close to Colorado Springs, Colorado. A must read."
5,book 2,this is book two of a series and I enjoyed all of them. Of course the first one was my favorite and I could not wait to read the sequels. I have read many by Kathleen Morgan and have enjoyed them all.
4,LOVED it!,"This story was especially wonderful, although i lovd all books in this series this is the one that stands out the most, revealing God's healing power of forgiveness and acceptance, when we stand firm in Him; yet all the time staying true to the human spirit of judgement, imperfectness and pure & simple humanity. This kind of reminded me of the Francine Rivers ""Redeeming Love"", being based in a similar time and similar background of the heroine. A great book and a great continuation of the series, remaining true to form of the pioneer era.Woman of Grace (Brides of Culdee Creek, Book 2)"
5,Great book,This book was fantastic. It made me realize what I need to do in my life. Things happen for a reason.
5,BOOK,I REALLY LIKE THE STYLE AND ALL THE BIBLE SCRIPTURE THAT THE AUTHOR REFERS TO. SHE USES IT THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. I AM CONSTANTLY REMINDED OF HOW GOD SPEAKS TO US DAILY AND ENCOURAGES US IN OUR STRUGGLES AND OUR VICTORIES. AN EASY READ. KEPT MY INTEREST.
5,great,"very well written, great reading, great story to keep you wanting to keep from putting the book down and not stop"
1,Complete Waste,Sorry..but I found this game to be a complete waste. A waste of money. A waste of time. The controller interface is a nightmare.
1,This is Jeopardy,"Answer: George Lucas, the Wachowski brothers, and the clowns that made this game.Question: Who are the only people who could *beep* an un*beep*able franchise?"
2,on every system!,"ok, most people have more then one system, i have a PS2 which plays copies, and the 360, hmmmmmmmmmm should i pay so much money for the 360 version????????? or should i go for the free copy i can download for the PS2?some people might say better graphics..hmmmmmmmmmm. dont care and many dont"
4,call of duty 3 what i think,"I didnt think it was all that great.If u play alot of games like i do you no that there are better out there,but i have to give credit where credit is do. This games graphics blow my mind!i would compare it to gears of war,or elder scrolls4 Oblivion gameplay was ok certanly alot better than the past 2 in the series and a WHOLE lot better than most other WWII shooters that ive seen"
3,Bug hunt,"Would have been a lot more fun without the [...] bugs such as not being able to move over random bits of terrain, stupid allies who get in the way at the most innappropriate time, or leave you to take on the whole Wehrmacht yourself. CoD2 didn't have these problems, and this is supposed to be better? I've heard that a different team was involved in the production of this version, and it shows. I've completed this on veteran, but don't have the same sense of acheivement I had when I'd finished CoD2 - where defeating the enemy was more important than defeating the bugs. Hope CoD4 is better."
3,COD 2 was much better,"I sold COD 2 and purchased this and wish I hadn't. This game seems more hurried together and lacks the cohesiveness in the story that COD 2 had. There are also more points where you seem to get stuck, i.e., the computer won't let you around a house so you have to reboot and then the next time it does.Not a horrible game but if you're going to spend the money COD 2 is far better...and cheaper."
3,Short and tedious,"It just seems like there are too many ""cut scenes"" that you have to sit through before you get to the game play. Then the game play itself gets done quickly and before you know it, the game is finished. I do like the fact that you can choose different strategies to go with. But I really liked Call of Duty 2 much better."
3,Nice but short,Nice game but to short. I have completed it in 3 days.In the middle you are getting bored.
1,What a disappointment,"I recently purchased Call of Duty 3 while it was one sale for $20. After playing it for about an hour I wouldn't have paid $1 for it. It is not that it is a horrible game. By itself I would have given it 3 stars for being ""ok"", however, compared to COD 2 and COD 4 (both of which are 5 star games) this game is horrible. The graphics are poor; the physics of the game are very simple compared to COD 2 and 4. There are too scenes where you can't play and you have to sit back and watch the game play out. The sound effects are simple. I don't know what happened from COD 2 to 3. I get the impression Activision had this game on the shelf and decided to release it and milk some money out of it after the popularity of COD 2. I am disappointed and have lost trust for Activision for putting out this crappy game under the COD title after the great job they did with COD 2."
1,Sad additions to a great series,"Not sure what Activision was thinking by putting this out. Call of Duty 2 was awesome. The game feels like a dumbed down version of 2 with lots of terrain bugs. On top of it, the AI is way dumber in 3. All in all, this game doesn't even deserve more of a description, if there is a black sheep in this series...this is it. Enough said."
3,"Not bad, just very disappointing...","Let me say one thing first- I absolutely loved Call of Duty 2. While the campaign was alot of fun, it was the multiplayer that really mattered to me. I preferred its smaller maps, fewer players and close quarter combat over games like Battlefield which featured huge maps and alot of players.Unfortunately, COD3 feels like a completely different game. This isn't surprising since it was developed by a different team than the one who did the first two installments. The main problem is that the multiplayer is essentially trying to be Battlefield. Does that make it bad? No, but it just isn't Call of Duty. If I wanted to play Battlefield, I would buy Battlefield.The single player campaign is decent, if a bit repetitive, and the graphics are a definite improvement over COD2. Overall, COD3 isn't a bad game, its just not a GREAT game, like the others in the COD series."
5,The best game I own,COD 3 is a great game with life-like animations and heart-stopping action. The Xbox Live multiplayer is even better. I love this game!
2,Could have been better,"I would consider myself a casual video game player and I finished this game in no time flat even with the overly long scenes that play between the levels of the game that you cannot skip through. I was highly disappointed that it was so short. It also seemed to have a lot of bugs where you get trapped by the terrain- I had to restart a checkpoint once because I could not get the soldier out. The AI was not very good either as the other allied soldiers would get in your way all the time or be nowhere in sight. To be fair though, the graphics and sound effects were amazing defintely on par with the best of the genre. It would be worth renting, but is a lousy buy. I recommend Gears of War or Rainbow Six Vegas for superior all around games."
1,big letdown,"I love Call of Duty 2 and was excited to get this one. But it is not even comparable to 2. The scenes are dark, it's difficult to aim, and it's hard to find other players in deathmatch."
2,Really disappointing,"My friends and I had high hopes for this game. We played COD2 multiplayer every week and were excited about a new shooter. After playing COD3 for a few rounds we decided to put 2 back in. The graphics are great, but we found a lot of bugs. There were some shading problems with the helmets that made them turn white at a certain distance. That's fine if you want to be a UN soldier, but not if you're trying to sneak up on somebody. Muzzle flashes were almost none existent. No blood splash like in COD2. The single player game isn't too bad so far, but if you plan on multiplayer I would recommend renting it first. We were of the opinion that the game was rushed, maybe they'll patch it."
3,Online Play,"To put in one sentence what many reviewers do in a paragraph, this game is useless outside of the online play. Single player is about as good as the early Medal of Honor games, and multiplayer maps are designed for huge battles. Online play, however, MAKES this game. It offers the ""smart"" enemies that the single player lacks, and the levels are all fun and unique. I have had this game for about 4 months, and i have played the single player twice. The multiplayer wil suck you in, you will choose your favorite weapon and become good with it, and you will be satisfied in the video game department for a long, long time.Of course, if you don't have xbox live this game is useless.By the way, Im not Mary Gard, Im her son, who is 15 years old and an experienced gamer."
2,Locked Up at the Crane,"I received CALL OF DUTY THREE for Christmas. It was easy but the graphics were great. The Problem: It locks up at the crane. I have tried everything to move forward, however, it locks up no matter what I do; then I must go back to the checkpoint and try it again. After about 10 times, I am ready to send it back."
2,What the hell?,Seriously....I was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet. It was all I use to play online. After purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes I quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since. Online play was non existent. Everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist. It was ridiculus. Letting someone else create this game instead of Infinity Ward was a giant mistake. This latest edition adds nothing to the series. Do not purchase this game....there are many better games out there.
3,Weakest Call of Duty yet.,"Compared to COD2, COD3 is more scripted, you cannot skip the passive parts which makes it very dull when you restart the game or get shot at the wrong time. I encountered a few problems where I got stuck and I had to restart the level which is really aggravating when you have to listen to the same old speech for the third time.COD2 was more fun, less buggy and more varied (Russia, France, Germany, Egypt, Tunisia...)."
1,Get Call of Duty 2 Instead,This mainly deals with online but is also applicable to single player.In COD 2 you could tell when you're shooting someone cause you'd see blood and then they'd fall over and clutch at their neck while they're dieing. In 3 you have no way of knowing you're hitting them. And when they die they just lay down and then start blinking and disappear. You can't even pick up their weapons immediately. In 2 I hated how the flag would stick out through walls. In 3 players weapons and limbs can stick out through walls. That is rediculously lazy on the game designers part.That's just a sample of the sloppiness with which this game was put togther. COD 2 was moving towards realism. 3 reverted to old cheap arcade tricks. The only good thing about it is it's bigger. But it's also cheap and sloppy. The gameplay is nowhere near COD 2. Not well thought out at all.
4,Similar to COD 2,"This is a solid game. It has good graphics, smooth framerates, and is fun to play. However, I don't see much if any improvement over COD 2 in single player mode. If you have not yet played COD 2 and are only interested in single player mode, I recommend getting it since it is cheaper and just as much fun. If you have already played COD 2 you may want to skip this one and instead get Gears of War, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, or Rainbow Six Vegas for something new."
3,shamfull for the franchise,"to be frankly I love CO2 is my favorite as halo 1 but the problem on this game is the company who made THIS PORT, it trasht the hole fun as the original CO2 was . [infinite ward- should it keep the sequel and not trachyard] he stupid uniform alike from german to the american and enghlis sometimes you don't know who to shoot.and if you shot a frienly fire .star over the checkpoint.the setting over to hard mode to finist the game is impossible not mention veteran mode .I'm desapointed with this port of the game .even online spend 30 minutes to find a soul to played a custom rank mode game.I just hope if CO4 IS OUT sometimes FEW year'S I HOPE[ INFINITE WARD MADE THE GAME THAT ONLY THEN KNOW HOW TO DO IT. i CROSSFINGER."
1,Not a good game,"I wad very dissapointed of this game. Call of Duty 2 was a lot better. The campain is the same as all the WWII games that came before it, storm the town, kill the Nazis. I'm kind of getting tired of WWII games too. They're all the same. Rent it, if you really love it, buy it.Get Gears of War instead. (I like the Civil war for xbox360 too)"
2,Call of Duty 3,I had such high expectations for this game just to have them shot down. The single player game is fine with some dumb things with the enemy AI. The muliplayer is a joke! Well first you have to get online which is basically impossiable. The Multiplayer which was the best part of 2 is totally stupid and WORTHLESS in 3. One you can play by yourself. Sounds like fun right? two you have to drive the tank unless you are the second person to the tank but you cant just use the machine gun which u can in the other vehciles stupid. Three there are some stupid errors in a bunch of levels where you can get stuck and have to respawn yourself. i say rent it before you buy it.
2,Not impressed...,"I have played every Call of Duty game out there. I played the first one for PC which was awesome. The I played call of duty 2 big red one, which was good. Then I played Call of Duty finest hour. Then Call of Duty 2 for xbox 360. Then, came the cod 3. This game was a flop in my opinion. The campaign was boring and medicore. The split screen multiplayer was stupid. The only reason I would buy this game is for the graphics, and Xbox Live. Activision failed to keep the hot streak going with this franchise. I just can't wait for COD4, modern warfare! YEAH!"
5,War Shooter At Its Best,"Another great game in the Call of Duty series. I couldn't get enough of this game! The storyline is very realistic and historically accurate. The graphics, combined with the amazing audio of the game put you directly in the war. Multiplayer is also very addictive. I highly recommend this game to any fan of FPS's."
3,I agree very buggy,"I agree with the person before me who left a comment about this game. I also got this game when it came out and it kept freezing in various spots. So I returned it to the store and got another of the same game thinking that this was just a chance event, but boy was I wrong. When I turned it on it worked no problem for a few hours or so then it froze up and I had to restart which was a real pain, this happend to regularily so I got tired and exchanged it for another game title.The game itself is great and the graphics are amazing if you can actually get it to work.Having the fact that it could freeze at anytime takes a lot of the fun out of this game."
5,ABSOLUTLY GREAT GAME,"I get hours and hours of enjoymet out of this one. Really great graphics, easy to learn and get into it, easy and intuetive controlls, great x-box live games. Even better than COD 2. - All arround a really great value."
2,Disappointing Sequel,"I fell in love with the Xbox 360 Call of Duty 2. An excellent game with great graphics and online play feel. I was chomping at the bit to purchase the new game. The graphics suffer in the online mode, this was done I believe to accomodate the extra players. The maps are too large and confusing. Many on-line players have returned to playing the far superior Call of Duty 2."
5,for French Americans !!!,Excellent ouvrage qui decortique a merveille les nevroses de la societe Francaise et beaucoup de Francais de l etranger vont se retrouver dans ces lignes parfois acerbes...If you have the chance to share your life with a great american lover this will help much more than you think... Part of your answers are there to enjoy the best of every culture. Enough to build a bridge over an Ocean and find the roots of an outstanding love...
5,Only the best for my family...,"This product was use by my mother for many years. Finally I,m able to provide the best for my family. I,ll be refering this product to my family and friends. Thanks"
2,Well made but may not work with some micrphones,"I bought these cables, they are quite well made, but it didn't work with my Memorex microphones.However it did work with my Shure PG 48 and 58.So far so good.*******************Update 29th Oct===================Must have bought a dozen of these and all of them came lose by now, so the microphones cut in and out.I have a dozen of these wires lying around, not sure what to do with it.It's not very durable, each wire last about 3 weeks or less.Being one of the highest priced xlr to 1/4 wire on amazon, I was expecting more for my investment."
5,Soul Stories,"Soul Stories offers a practical model for teaching adults. The author engages the reader through the use of storylinking, in conjunction with reflective excercises and activities.This book is easily adaptable for all teaching styles. You'll find the real life stories enlighting.Can be used for any audience."
2,Where there is weakness,"The basis of Yogananda's book is weakness and perhaps fears. The book consists of Yogananda quotations thematically arranged, and much revolves around fear and worry.""May I Overcome Fear"", ""Practical Anecdotes for Fear and Worry"", ""Ridding the Consciousness of Worry"" and focus on fearlessness reveals that fear and worries make a book market.Now in the case of neurotic fears and worries, therapy might help.A realistic appraisal of things feared and worried about, can help too.However, a blunt denial of fear and worry and of their possibly reasonable foundations, may do more harm than good. There is that danger with shortsighted ""kindergarten books"" in the school of life."
4,O'Malley's Another Man's Wound,"Ernie O'Malley gives a free form rememberence of his activities during the Irish War for Independence. Unlike the methodical analysis of Tom Barry in Guerrilla Days, O'Malley gives his view of the war in a more emotional way. Perhaps that is not the correct way to describe it, but this book contains more of the personal feelings and thoughts of an educated Dublin man on the run in rural Ireland. He hates the food, he finds the conversation dull, but the spirit of the people carry him on. O'Malley adds life to our view of this violent era in Irish history and strips away much of the myth while adding to the heroics."
5,Anglo-Irish War,If you are looking to learn about the Anglo-Irish War - this is a great place to start. I think O'Malley was an exceptional writer - very descriptive. I would read this book first and then get his next two books.
3,Thought it was bigger,"Bought this as a gift for my dad. From viewing the images I thought it was much larger. The detail on the model is great, which is why I misjudged its size. It's about the same size as a hot wheels car."
2,The basics,"This novel is perfect for the type of person whom doesn't read very often but once in a while likes a basic simple uncomplicated romance novel they can read in one sitting. I don't like to slam books because the authors put a lot of heart into them, but this book came as part of a series of teeny tiny books that lost appeal with each one. They seemed forced out in the end and it felt as if the author was following a template that repeated itself. It was an okay book, but I forced myself to finish it."
3,Just ok....,"I'm not a reader of romance as a rule. I don't like them and I never have. I read this book first, not knowing it was part of a series. I wasn't crazy about it, but it was a welcome distraction. A co worker thought that I should read Ms. Phillips' work and handed me this book. And, although I did like the story, I'm still not a reader of romance. With that said, the story was put together nicely. Ms. Phillips had great characters and great emotion. Not my cup of tea, but not a bad read."
3,Sexy but predictable,"Character descriptions are good...I felt I could really see the characters. Unlike many Harlequins, it wasn't too short. BUT, like most Harlequins, the plot is predictable. What keeps it from being totally boring is that the primary characters do have depth. Overall, sexy, sensual, predictable, easy read."
2,Simply...a let down,"Taking the lead of her brother Logan, Grace Montgomery rejects her family's wealth and lives her life in Manhattan as a regular gal. When her job takes her into some pretty rough neighborhoods, meddlesome grandma Emma is concerned and hires a PI to keep an eye on her. Ben takes the apartment next door and soon has more than his eyes on her. As he accompanies her on her excursions, and happen upon a bit of mystery, the two grow closer together. Grace is just happy that she has found a regular guy to love her for who she is, not because of her family's wealth. But when Grace finds out the truth about Ben, will she walk away?The last in the ""Simply"" series proves that sometimes authors should quit while they are ahead. Yes, the requisite steam is there, but the plot is so recycled and loaded with so much trite dialogue, it was hard to get through at times. It was a bit of a disappointment."
4,"Hot, hot, hot","Phillips does her best to pull the reader in right from the beginning. Her steamy scenes keep you longing for more, and the plot thickens as threatening notes are thrown into the mix. A great read; you'll never want to put it down!"
2,"Only because I finished it, but really didn't want to!","It is just too corny- not believable. I cannot believe this is a best selling book- maybe for 12 year olds, but not for adults. The plot is too simplistic and though the hero is great, it just doesn't ring true. Save your money for Jude, SEP, Girls of Summer or Sweet Hush by Deborah Smith. Don't waste your money; you will be sorry.two stars only because I finished it. I gave it to my sister who also said it was the worst book she's read in ages, and she reads a book a day!"
2,Way too small ****sigh****,"Although the gold colour was rich and appealing, the size of the charm was way too small for my purposes. So, I returned it for a refund."
4,"Cute, but did not come with tray as pictured / described","My two year old got these for Christmas. She loves them and they are cute and well made. However, they did not come with the storage tray as pictured. Still a cute item, but the tray would have been nice. This same thing happened to me with the Melissa and Doug condiments."
5,"Very Cute Toy, Great for Pretending!","This toy seems simple enough but the lids, which are magnetic, really make the product. The lids easily go on and stay put, and make the bottles seem like ""real"" products. My kids love the different shapes of the bottles and the lids are really great, it provides an action to accomplish as well as pretending. My two and four year olds both love this product and I purchased the kitchen set too."
4,Kurtz is amazing.,Beautiful Yesterday has some of the best songs ever. Kurtz's voice is husky and haunting. Even the liner notes were terrific. This is one CD I'll listen to over and over.
3,Uncomfortable,"These glasses are good looking, but are extremely uncomfortable. Then you feel like you can't return them because you've unpackaged them and wore them for an hour and then felt they were uncomfortable. I would not recommend them."
2,"The best available, but needs a revision","If you want to climb at Potrero Chico or many other rock areas in Mexico, this is about the only guide around. It was a good first effort, but I look forward to a future edition, not only for more recent information, but hopefully for a more ambitious effort. Still, if you're going to PC, buy this guide!"
3,Good historic resource,"This is an early pattern book that was in circulation during the mid and late 1800's. It is good only as a historic resource for those wishing to further their studies in American architecture. It is not a practical book for a practicing architect, builder, or restoration buff. The plates are beautiful and the descriptive geometry is fascinating."
2,Don,The copies of original drawings was done very poorly making them very hard to use as a reference.
5,Don't Listen to that Other Guy!,"This is, by far, The Frosted Ambassador's best record yet! Gone are the plodding heavy-metal rhythms, the weird chanted/screeched pseudo-gothic chanting, the black Satanic monks' robes, and the nearly pornographic and extremely embarrasing self-confessional lyrics of past albums. What remains is a pleasant amalgam of ""Piper At The Gates Of Dawn""-era Pink Floyd psychedelia and warm Beach Boys harmonies. Charming! And the Ambassador's graciously allowing the buyer to name the vague suites of melodic insanity allows me to name track 2 ""Ralf and Florian In Hawaii"" (since it sounds like early Kraftwerk on vacation someplace fun)! This may not sit well with their old fans, but for the rest of us, this is a must buy CD! What are you waiting for? Whip out that credit card!"
5,GOD'S GRACE !,IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE BOOK OF ROMANS THE ENTIRE BIBLE WILL OPEN UP TO YOU !! A MUST READ !!
2,Short Story....,"I just wanted to make it clear that this is A SHORT FILM!! It was about 25 minutes long with credits and introductions and all. It was good work for a short film, but I wish it would have been a full length movie. I ""got"" what the movie was conveying, but I still wish it would have been a full length movie. I know Billy Wirth did a short film, but I didn't think this one was it, but it was. So, if you have about half an hour to kill before going to work or going to bed then you check this out."
4,Details abound in this book on beliefs of the human embryo.,This is a very detailed account of the status of a human embryo throughout history. It does a good job of giving a detailed account of different thinkers throughout the ages and their impact on the Christian view of a human embryo. Often I think it can be too detail oriented and does a rather rushed job on getting all the facts to mesh together. But overall I would consider this a good read for those looking to dig deeper into the Christian tradition of the fetus.
5,A comprehensive overview of Christian thought on the unborn,"This excellent and well-researched book follows the history of Christian reflection on the human embryo. Focusing mostly on abortion, although also discussing some of the issues arising from IVF and embryo research, David Jones traces the history of thought about the status of the unborn through the Jewish tradition, Greek and Roman thought and Christian theology through the ages.His wide-ranging research and masterful summaries of the various positions set out the groundwork for an understanding of the issues. His book shows that Christians have generally been fairly consistent in their outlook over the centuries but issues such as the ""soul"" and the moment at which an embryo becomes a human being are deeply complex and still very much under discussion.An excellent resource for those interested in ethics and the theology and history around them."
4,!wow...intrigante!,"!I was fascinante while listen for the first time; yet, i kept hearing new sounds everytime i played it over-n-over!"
5,Simplemente diferente...,"Es rara la vez que vos encontr?is este tipo de m?sica; el estilo diferente, los sonidos combinados y la manera de mezclar ni se diga.Si vos no lo has comprado hazlo pronto, estoy segura de que te va a encantar.He escuchado esta m?sica en otros lados y se que ahora tambi?n la puedes obtener en i-Tunes as? es que, que esper?is? Apuraos a obtener tu copia.Techno, 80's, rock, world, tu decides, pero creo que es simplemente diferente."
5,Work Bowl,My wife wanted a second work bowl for her Cuisinart food processor. This one is an exact match to the original and functions exactly the same. It appears to be made of identical materials as the original and should last just as long.
2,A Dissappointing Episode,"Ugh! I love Battlestar Galactica, but this is easily one of the worst episodes. The best part is the Cylon attack in the beginning where the agro ships are destroyed. Adama's love interest is annoying and the whole story gets bogged down in another ""wild west"" shanty town similar to the one in the episode ""The Lost Warrior"". Unquestionably one of the most disliked episodes and perfect proof of how the writing can suffer when a television show like BG is rushed into production too fast."
4,24 Hours is more like 24 Days but that's still good!,"I needed to learn the latest standard of HTML 4 and this book's title caught my eye. I like the format of the Sams 24 lessons each taking an hour. But it takes more than an hour to do each lesson if you input the examples yourself and have to debug your syntax errors. The only problem I had was with the XML example that did not work and did not work on the author's website either. I would get a ""process could not start"" error and I'm using the Microsoft browser IE 6, so it shouldn't be a browser problem. Anyway, I recommend this book for active professionals that want a ""working"" textbook they can use to have your website up and running in about 6 hours from ""scratch"" provided you have space reserved on the internet to create a website."
3,Needs to be buffed for best results,"After trying many different products to keep my wheels clean, I have decided that this product is just average. The small bottle doesn't last long, and the product needs to be buffed off to a sheen if you want optimal results. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it adds another step. If you're going to buff the product anyway, wheel wax is a better option. It is useful to coat the lug nut recesses and the inside of the wheel if you have a hard time getting your hand in there to buff off the excess."
5,A definite must buy!!!,"If you like truly good song lyrics, folk music and 10 string guitar, then this is a must buy. The Seekers did so much more than just 'Georgy Girl.' Every song has meaning and heart."
4,Almost too much but still worth the time.,"Five disks of The Seekers with everything they ever did is almost too much but still worth the investment for someone semi-stuck in the 60's folk scene. You definitely don't want to put all five disks in the changer and listen to them back-to-back--maybe doing the shuffle with them would work.It is an uneven collection with some of the early tracks fading in and out a little and some of the audition tracks aren't really worth having or listening to beyond the first time. After that, well, there's not much point in going back.All in all, because I love Judith's voice, not another one in the world like it (some come close) all the big hits and the lesser ones are worth having and I come back to them often when I need my 60's fix.The collection is worth having - a four disk set without the auditions and b sides would have worked just as well for me."
5,The best of the best,"There is perhaps no more quintessential folk/pop group than The Seekers. Like many of the other listeners, I fell in love with many of these songs when I first heard them as a child back in the 60's. Messrs. Guy, Potger and Woodley, and Ms. Durham tapped a wellspring of yearning in the folk idiom that has yet to be exhausted. And if you dig this complete assembly of their earlier recordings, you'll definitely want to get ""Future Road,"" recorded 30 years after their last gigs! This collection brings together the fun, spirit and life that folk music embodies. Two thumbs way, way up!"
4,"Recommended, but with some reservations","Exquisitely sung disc, with a mix of old favorites and some lesser-known works. The choir seems especially well suited to the quieter, more reflective works, such as ""God be in my head"" and ""Shepherd's Farewell"". I was. however, very disappointed with the more rousing works, particularly ""Jerusalem"" and ""Old Hundredth"", which on this disc are given very matter-of-fact, verging on moribund, treatments at inordinately slow tempi. Most enjoyable otherwise."
3,Great Product But Limited Usefulness,"This product features great, clear magnification, but is only useful if you can hold the product still from 4 to 10 inches away from the page you're reading for an extended period of time. I do not do much reading at the table or on flat surfaces, so it was not very useful and I returned it. I'm still looking for a product that will help me read books in bed, and unfortunately this wasn't it. I would recommend this product if you read the newspaper, or would like something to help pay the bills that's not a small magnifier, and if you have a steady hand. I will continue to buy Bausch & Lomb for all of my optical needs."
2,Reading glass,"Not much help in reading a newspaper or book. Too bulky. Have to hold in maybe 4"" away. Not much use!"
1,Poor quality,"I found it a little cloudy, and I was too aware of the magnifying lines on the magnifier to be distracting. I bought several different brands of these magnifiers, and this was the most expensive and the most disappointing. I expected a better quality from Bausch and Lomb. I like the Mighty Bright brand magnifier better."
1,"Cheap flimsy plastic, poor quality Fresnel lens, distorted magnification","Are you dealing with Macular Degeneration? Do you think this product will help you read an entire standard 8 x 11 page? You would be wrong.Don't be fooled by the Bausch & Lomb branding. The distortion from this cheap, flimsy, stamped out plastic Fresnel lens is just pathetic.My Mom pretty much tossed this product away after 10 minutes. She hated it.I ended up buying her one of these:http://www.amazon.com/Carson-Optical-Lighted-Magnifold-Magnifier/dp/B0001WB65A/High quality glass lens.And she liked it so much I bought her two more. So one for her purse when she goes out so she can read menus, one for the breakfast table for reading the paper, and one for the couch where she reads her books and magazines."
1,Magnifier,I ordered this for an elderly friend. We found the magnifier to be very blurry. We purchased another product elsewhere.
4,a little heavy!,a little heavy! but my father loved them . great help for reading and very portable! great for reading but no good for burning insects :D
4,Very good,"No complaints here. A bit heavy though so despite the good quality it might not be the best choice for prolonged reading because, like all Fresnel lenses, it has to be held a few inches from the page."
2,Difficult to use,"I hoped to use this product to read small print more easily. I did not realize how difficult it would be to use. It is rigid and the plexiglass is covered with a pattern of small grooves for some reason. Unless held in exactly the right position, the image is very blurry. There is also glare if the light hits it at all. Holding it in the right position is not easy, it doesn't work to just rest it on the page."
2,Know how to use it before you buy it,"I bought this thinking I could place it on the page of the book and it would be magnified. Wrong. You have to hover it over what you're reading in order for it to work. Would not have ordered it if I'd realized that. It's okay for looking up phone numbers or reading the small print, but not for books, which is what I wanted it for."
4,Ask me when I'm sure,"Ask me in a year or so when I know whether the battery (which didn't say it was a Dell on the battery- and no brand name-) works good. I have to say, it came before predicted and seems like it will be a good battery as long as it doesn't do anything unpredictable like warp or lose charge. This is my third battery for my 2004 (antique?!) Dell Inspiron. I didn't know they needed to be changed even when I bought the laptop. Amazon kept asking for a review, so this is an interim one. I like it."
3,VERY slow delivery...but fine product,It took about three weeks and a couple of e-mails to the company before I received my product. If you are in a hurry...go somewhere else. The product was fine once it was delivered. Nice price.
1,Fried my laptop,"The case of this battery cracked the first time I tried to use it. I had a very tough time getting the battery out of my laptop due to the cracked case. When I put the original battery back in, my laptop wouldn't work. The battery light flashes. So now my laptop is fried. Don't buy this battery. Insist on a Dell original. (I am not affiliated with Dell in any way.)"
1,TOSHIBA'S ABYSMAL CUSTOMER SERVICE..,"Buyer beware...I bought this model's predecessor, the DVR-3 last November. Never worked. sent for repair ($20 mail fee) - still didn't work. Sent back for exchange in May($13 mail fee). Toshiba has had my unit since May 13th (almost 5 weeks) and has not replaced it. In spite of 6 or 7 calls and e-mails, still no replacement. I am starting to think they have no intention of replacing my unit even though they have my cash. Whenever I contact them I get the same line - 'we are looking into other options' (whatever that means), and we will call you - surprisingly, no calls. Obviously I will never buy from Toshiba again and think other (potential) customers might appreciate this tidbit of info...buyer beware!!"
1,I'd give it 0 stars if I could. BIG waste of time and money.,"I'd love to figure out how this thing works, but after months of frustration, I'm ready to trash it. I'm not even sure it's worth sending for repair. It doesn't like any DVD that I use, and I can't get the timer to work, not even for VHS. The OTR button works fine, which isn't helpful if I want to record something while I'm out. I've read the manual over and over, but to no avail. The remote has so many buttons on it, it's takes a while to figure out which button you're supposed to press; NOT user friendly. I'll never buy another Toshiba product again. I wish I would have returned the unit so that I could get my money back, but I was determined to make this work. I now see that it's impossible. (BTW, I didn't purchase this through Amazon, and it's too late to return it now. The Manufacturer's Warranty isn't worth the trouble, because I no longer want to own this unit!)"
1,Dead,Got it today! Looks great! Plugged it in won't even light up! Now I have to pay the shipping back and wait!!!!!!!! What a bummer!!!!!!!!!!
2,8 days out of the box and the VHS bites it - had to return unit.,"Bought this as an open box at my local Best Buy store May 2006. about 10 days later after playing no more than 12-15 VHS tapes the VHS player crapped out - screen filled with snow and no ammount of cleaning tapes or ""rest"" improved the situation. No VHS tapes can be played now. I am returning the machine and looking at other brands and models now."
1,Thank IAD BALT it is out of print!,"Truly a terrible book. The information is either pulled straight out of other books, and full of errors, or Schueler is on some flight of fancy that has nothing to do with Enochian. After reading this book, it is apparent that he does not practice Enochian Magick at all. Even for Llewellyn, which is famous for releasing poorly researched books, this is a low. Pass up any of Schueler's books, and get one by James or Tyson instead. Or go straight to the diaries ;)The Angels themselves will give you all of the Advanced Enochian you can handle!"
1,Great for a laugh but totally absurd,"Unfortunately this is my nephew's favorite book right now, the good thing is that he can't read. I honestly cannot believe anyone would publish this book, although the pictures are nice. The author actually states that humans and dinosaurs co-existed (dinosaurs were created on the 6th day incase you didn't know)! It is sad that people would teach their children incorrectly about our world's history. I did have a good lauch, but trust me when he can read and comprehend, it will not be this book!"
3,Oye Coma Va?,I don't get why Oye Como va was on this. There's a lot of other good songs on here but I reccomend the first one more than this one. This is pretty good and I seriecly think you should buy this album.
3,writers beware,"Don't buy this book if you're still trying to sell yours to a publisher. Though it does have invaluable information on how to negotiate a contract, it spends the first chapter or two telling you how hopeless your attempts at selling your own book without an agent are. More agent propaganda and self-aggrandizement."
2,Needs updating urgently!,"I found the book informative, but it lacks the current information--like the fact that publishers of fiction now want at least 70,000 word manuscripts before they will even look at it. Curtis's book is discouraging, I agree, but the fact is that it really seems to be like he depicts. If it were more up-to-date, I would've added two additional stars to my rating."
5,Down By Law - Puttin the boots in once again,"Down By Law is back again with another fantastic album. Windwardtidesandwaywardsails is the best Down By Law album since Punkrockacademyfightsong. Maybe the one word run on is the way for this band to go with album titles. This album is inexpensive and well worth it. Fourteen tracks in 36 minutes or so makes you wanna listen to it over and over again. The entire album is good and ""I wanna be in AC/DC"" is a track that you will never forget. If your looking for the new N Sync album look somewhere else, but if your looking for some classic punk rock, this is the next album that you should put in your collection."
4,The Man with the Mouth!,"This one is fun! But it is also heartwarming at times.My favorite moments:1) Ali's playful and even sweet banter with Howard Cosell.2) Ali's respectful words of tribute for Joe Frazier.3) Ali defends true Islam during the days of 9/114) Sidney Poitier's recitation of Ali's response to those who accuse African-Americans of hating European-Americans.Enjoy the rap. Enjoy the famous faces. Enjoy the full-presentation of ""The Rumble in the Jungle"". But consider the mind and soul behind these various statements, poems, and conversations. Ali: maybe the greatest, but certainly the most entertaining."
5,Excellent new or used.,"It would cost a mint to buy every story in paper back or double story hard cover books. I read 1 or 2 stories a night to my son. He loves the book! That says volumes in 1 big hardcover! God bless, Thomas The Tank Engine."
5,The Complete Edition,Our son loves this book. When he received it for Christmas he stopped opening the rest of his gifts and looked at this book. My wife and I had to make him open the rest of his gifts. Our son love any Thomas The Tank Engine Product.
4,Good book if your child is over 4,"I purchased this book for my two year old not too long away. My 2 year old is very advanced and can name every Thomas character that appears in the Thomas and Friends tv show. This book was way too advanced for him. The art work is average and he lost interest very quickly. He was more interested in trying to rip the pages, or skate on top of the book! The stories are good, but I would suggest waiting until your child is older and can appreciate the book more.Learning Curve and Brio took full marketing advantage of this book by making toy characters that were mentioned only in one story and then never again such as Neil, Mike, Culdee, Catherine, Ivo Hugh, The Flying Scotsman, Wilbert, Frank and Fred. My two year old now knows these characters and of course I feel compelled to buy them for him! Problem is many are retired and will cost alot of money to try to find them on Ebay or Amazon!"
2,not really meant for small children,"I bought this for a 4 year old. He has loved thomas since he was little. I bought him the big yellow and the big blue for the last 2 christmases, but this one has less pictures and its not very friendly. The trains often seek revenge and harbor hateful feelings toward the others."
3,"Kids love it, But Im not thrilled","First of all my 3 year old son LOVES this book. But Im concerned about how snobby and elitest the trains all are to each other. There seems to be alot of color bias and gossip. I dont think it really makes clear the positive lessons that you should be getting from it. Also, the kids may be confused about some of the trains being a different color in the book that they are of video. Also, Sir Topham hat is called The fat controller and I dont think thats very nice. Thats just my opinion!"
1,My son loves the trains; I hate the stories,"My 4-year-old is a big Thomas fan, and loves to play with his Thomas/Brio trains. We have tried to avoid the videos and books as much as possible, however, since the stories are so negative. The trains are SO NASTY to one another that there are NO positive role models. Preachy, over-simplistic moralism combined with characters who model negative behavior.Fortunately, our son does NOT have the trains imitate the ones in the videos when he plays with his Thomas trains. (On the other hand, I am getting tired of that ""Really Useful Engine"" song)."
5,Wonderful entertainment,"Wonderful entertainment for any child, this collection additionally provides interest for adults who find fascination in the history and artistry of things."
4,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE COMPLETE COLLECTION,Bought for my Grandsons. Just as advertised and in very good condition. Actually started reading the book and thoroughly enjoy it. Thank You.
5,Thomas Is No Plain Train!,"My daughter enjoyed watching the Thomas the Tank Engine videos at our local library. I bought this book last winter for her (age 2) and she fell in love with the story books too. Now my one year old son lugs the book around, when his sister is not looking, sets it on mommy or daddies lap climbs up and wants to look at the pictures and hear a story! I think we're ready for another copy with all the wear and tear this one has received.P.S. Daddy kind of likes the stories too! ;-)"
4,It's like your best friend telling you a story,"I could remember vividly most of the events that were stated in the book. Even if the names of the characters and places are changed, they are very familiar. It's definitely a story with the fall of the Marcos regime as a backdrop. I could relate to that book because I was in Manila at that time when some of the events mentioned became chapters in Philippine history."
4,"Fascinating story, very well-written","Set in a ""small South Seas island"" that is easily recognizable as the Philippines, Eating Fire and Drinking Water is a fascinating, well-written book that successfully melds the chaos of a dying authoritarian regime, the idealism of activist youths, the homegrown cunning of the poor and dispossessed and the surreal religiosity that is all too familiar to Filipinos and those who have spent time in the country. I applaud Arlene J. Chai for not succumbing to the slogans and the jargon that were carelessly brandished about during the period she writes of. And I envy her her skill in putting together a story that is at once plausible (because many of the things she wrote about actually happened) and riveting. I could not put down the book -- everything was too familiar. I felt that I was back to that time and that place that have shaped me to what I am right now."
1,Contrived and disjointed,"Chai attempts to write many different stories and have them converge. The result is a hodge-podge of poorly developed characters whose relationships feel contrived.Chai builds suspense by foreshadowing events, but she abuses this ploy too often! It became an annoyance.The scope of this book is ambitious, and Chai cannot live up to the challenge. Characters, emotions, and plots are lost in the hands of an amateur storyteller.""The Last Time I Saw My Mother"" was a touching book, but this second novel is very poorly written."
4,Finally complete!,"Finally got myself a COMPLETE score of the best ballet ever written, not just a digest that is being widely offered. Thanks! ANd the preformance is quite good too :)"
2,"No power, viberates itself to death",Just used on a weekend camping trip and we are frequent campers. You have to be within 2 ft of the thing to feel any breeze at all and thats on the high setting. And when its on the high setting the thing can't sit still it viberates so bad that it bounces off the table or whatever you set it on. We ended up hanging it up so it didnt fall over in our tent. It ran all night on high so i guess the battery life is good but you may be better off checking out other fans if you plan on using this while camping.
2,weak and noisy,This fan produces a gentle breeze that can cool off a small tent on a hot night. And it will run all night at low power on a set of D cells. But after just a few uses it has become very noisy. It still seems to work OK if you can stand the racket.
2,"Great concept, bad quality","Broke after two nights camping, it worked well for the first two nights, then just died. New batteries did not help."
2,Doesn't really work that great,Fan didn't have very much blowing power and one of the fans we bought made a weird noise and moved around a bit as well. Wouldn't buy again.
2,Quality control is a problem.,"I purchased two of these fans. Out of the box, both made a lot of noise that I was able to remedy by dismantling them and re-gluing everything correctly. I made them run silently, but I shouldn't have to do that myself."
2,Very noisy,I returned this fan as it was extremely noisy and not as expected. probably made in China . . .
1,Maybe you'll be luckier than me,"I purchased this fan for a weekend camping trip in humid 90 degree weather. It worked pretty well on the first night....on high, there was significant circulation to my upper body when placed to air mattress on a small table. Unfortunately, the fan wouldn't turn on the next night. I installed fresh batteries and still nothing. I opened up base to discover a faulty switch...it wasn't making contact properly. I thought I fixed it, but once jostled too much, would not make contact again. Ridiculously shoddy craftsmanship, which SUPER surprises me with a Coleman product."
1,Great for a day or two,The fan worked fantastic for a few days then died for no reason. Even tried replacing the new batteries with new batteries...still dead. Good luck with this one. Coleman has really lost its quality. Does anyone know of a good battery operated fan that will work for a few years?
1,2ND CHANCE,Item arrived on time. Used it during last camping trip and fan worked flawlessly for 2 hours straight....then stopped. Changed battery and did not work ever since. Sent it back and just got the replacement. Will try at the house for a few days and we'll see if it does the same thing.
2,"Not what I expected,","I bought 2 of these fans, since my daughter and I were going camping with a group in July. While the fans worked well when they worked, they did not last more than one night. Both fan's started slowing down and speeding up, then stopped completely. We changed out the batteries (I had purchased Duracell and new ones) without any luck, even though the fans were suppose to last longer than 7 hours on one set of batteries. The other 3 nights were very uncomfortable as it was very humid and muggy. I have return them to Amazon and plan on getting a different brand. Very disappointed with Coleman, this is the second item I have purchase of their's that did not hold up."
4,Coleman Free-Standing Tent Fan,"Over all it is a good product.A bit noisy, and for our temperatures here in Arizona you have to be close to the faneven at the high setting. Another issue is the mounting, in a tent or portable gazebo it is hard tohook some where."
4,Simple and long lasting,"I have had this fan now for 2 years and I don't think I have changed the D batteries once. It is still going strong. With some halfway decent batteries, this fan will fun FOREVER. Now, don't expect this to cool your entire tent down. You would need 20 of these to feel the breeze from across the tent.... but ... on a hot night, having this next to your bed will cool you down enough to make you pretty comfortable. You definitely need one for each camper though..."
2,Worked for half of one night,"I bought this fan to take on a recent camping trip where we slept in a tent for two nights. I brought this fan(new in the box) with 4 brand new D batteries. The box advertises that the fan will run for 21 hours of continuous use on one set of batteries. The fan was not running when we woke up on the first morning and did not work for the rest of our trip. With 85% humidity, I was not too pleased. We did check the batteries in our air mattress pump, and they were still charged. I will be returning this fan."
4,Dissapointed,Had this fan for less that a three months and it quit. Thought it was the batteries but that wasn't the problem.
2,Didn't last long,"The fan worked great, for an hour or two. Then it used up all the batteries and died. You would have to spend a small fortune on batteries to keep this thing running. I would not recommend purchasing this product."
5,Breezy,This fan does a great job for closed in small areas.We use in our camper and it sits just about anywhere.Was very happy with the low and high settings.It feels really good when you are hot and sticky.The delivery time was quick also!THANK YOU
1,Not Worth the $$$,"I bought this fan on clearance for $5. We took it on a camping trip and it did ok the first time. We just took it on a 2nd camping trip and it was pitiful. It was very loud and put out very little air. I thought maybe it just needed new batteries, nope. We put fresh batteries in it and it didn't change at all. As a one time use item it isn't bad, but to pay $20 for a one time use is not very frugal. I'm just grateful I only spent $5 on ours."
4,MY NUMBER ONE FAN!,This thing is pretty cool.I like it and it does what it says it will do.Blows air.Yay.
3,"It's alright, but batteries didn't last too long for us...","I purchased two of these fans for a camping trip. I figured might as well pick them up since they got such great reviews about how long the batteries last. Considering they take D size batteries, it's not cheap to replace them when they do go out. We turned them on as we fell asleep and they might have lasted around 4 or 5 hours before they were completely dead. I actually expected that, but was just going off the reviews that people said it would run all night. Oh well, next time I'll follow my gut instinct.Besides that, they are great little fans. The blades are soft, so no worries about children getting hurt and they are made pretty well. I would recommend that if you do pick one up, invetst in some rechargable D size batteries for it.Happy camping!"
4,good fan,"Its a little smaller than i imagined, but now that im looking a the picture again, its accurate. Its a good little fan. A bit bigger than the ones that clamp onto something (like the kind the school bus drivers here in Texas always had blowing down on them- lol).It has foam blades, takes 4 d batteries. Doesn't fall over. Im happy with it*Not just for camping! great for work or at home."
2,"Good circulation, too noisy","The fan provided great circulation in my tent, but is VERY loud. It was so noisy I couldn't sleep and had to turn it off. It's possible it could just be a defect with the one I received since I didn't see too many other reviews about the noise level of this fan."
5,"nice fan, nice price","Used it for a cub scout trip in the summer and it worked great. Also used it on the deck at home and it was a very nice addition. For the price, you can't beat it but it does plow through the batteries."
2,big disappointment,"Work for only 21 hours, the of batteries. When I added new batteries; it would run. No guard in front of fan."
4,Fan works well in harsh conditions,"I purchased this fan to help move the air around in my steam shower, where the floor would get cooler than the ceiling. Knowing that I just needed some kind of battery-powere operation and knowing that this was not the intended use of the fan, I am reporting that the fan works very well in an environment of 120 degree heat and ~100% humidity. While the foam blades held some water which consequently caused them to weigh more and which negatively affected fan speed, the fan itself worked fine for what it is - an inexpensive way to move air with a battery-operated lightweight device."
4,Works good to keep you cool in the tent.,Works good fan.. Blades seem a bit breakable but at the same time they won't injure you so I guess that is good.The wiring could be better wires could be snagged and ripped.
4,Coleman Fan,"This is a nice little fan. It takes 4 D cell batteries. It gives off some air, but if you are looking for a nice strong breeze this is not the fan. It is a little fan that gives off a little breeze. When it is hot and you do not have anything else I am sure you will be happy with it."
3,Coleman Free-Standing Tent Fan,"The fan is compact and portable. It puts out a very good air flow for being small. The blades are safe, as they are soft. The reason I'm giving only three stars is that it's VERY noisy, at least mine is. The people that reviewed this fan as being quiet must be hard of hearing. If you don't mind the noise, I would recommend the product."
1,Drained the batteries within 6 hours!,"I do not recommend this fan. At least not for long-term long-hour use.I initially bought this to help me sleep, I'm currently living off-grid, and since my main source of power is a generator, I obviously can't leave it going all night to power a regular fan. So I figured, hey, why not buy a battery-powered fan? Now I wasn't expecting this fans batteries to really last more than 2-3 days, but I was very surprised when this fan drained the four D batteries before my alarm even went off the next morning!Perhaps this fan is good for only occasional use, but it really didn't push much air around and it also made a strange grinding noise after only about 2 hours.All and all, not a good fan. I found a much better (and only 2 dollars more expensive) fan at walmart in the camping section which only takes two D batteries, and the battery life lasts much longer."
1,Worked for less than ten hours,"This fan is a waste of money. When we set it up, it worked perfectly. When we got it to the campsite, it worked perfectly. Did a fairly good job of circulating air through our tent. Then, it died. Thought it was the batteries so we replaced all of them. It just stopped working. It worked for less than ten hours total."
1,Very Disappointing for a Coleman product,"I ordered 3 of these fans to use during our participation in the Susan G. Komen 60 mile 3 day walk. We would be tent camping the beginning of August in Chicago and I knew the tents would be hot. I searched quite a bit for small battery operated fans and thought I had found a winner. We had to pack light so needless to say, the boxes got tossed. One fan did not even work the first night. The other two worked during the walk - thank goodness. Without the box, I was afraid I would not be able to return the non-working fan. Since the other two were working I figured I had received one lemon. However, fan #2 quit working after the 4th use, about a month later. The 3rd quit working after the 6 use, about 2 months later. I am totally disappointed that Coleman would manufacture such a cheap, worthless product. The price was very reasonable, but I guess it is true what they say - you get what you pay for. And these fans definitely are not worth even 1 cent!"
1,Piece of Junk,"This is the worst item I have ever bought from Amazon. Bought it for my daughter to take to camp. It stopped working after 24 hours. She put fresh batteries in it and still nothing. After she came home, I played around with it as well. If you put it at a certain angle, the blades moved around very slowly, but it you moved it the least bit, it didn't work at all."
5,LOVE IT!,I got this fan to take to hotels when I travel. I have a small fan next to my bedside at home and love the cool breeze on me when I sleep. I was rooming with friends at a hotel and I was concerned all the plug-in would be used to charge cell phones or I-pods so I got this fan. It really kicks out a nice breeze. I used it 2 nights in a row and had it on all night long. I figured it would have dead batteries by the 2nd morning but it was still going strong. It was a good purchase. I plan to use it on my deck this summmer to keep pesky flies away.
2,Good while it lasts,"I was very excited to get this fan. We turned the fan on high and it barely lasted 5 hours. It moved quite a bit of air and felt really good in our medium tent. Maybe different batteries would help, but the Duracell's didn't last. Overall great idea, not so great turnout."
1,Noisy.,This fan was a big disappointment. It moves air alright but is so obnoxiously noisy that we never used it. I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do with it now. It got a little dusty on our trip so I don't think that I can return it. Bummed about the waste of money!
4,Nice Surprise!,I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived - much stronger than I would have expected from a battery-operated fan! It made a remarkable difference when used on our 95-degree-day camping event.
2,Great for a while,I was very impressed with this fan right up to when it stopped working. I put maybe 4 hours on in before it started to make a little clicking noise. After about 8 hours it just stopped.I don't think this fan was really engineered with any durability in mind. If you have to have it just leave it on your dresser and only use it for blackouts on hot nights. It might hold up for that.I'm still looking for a portable camp/tent fan that will go the distance.
1,return of fans,I recieved both fans ant niether of them worked. I needed them that weekend so I did not get to use them. So I sent them back for a refund.
1,Don't waste your money,Thank goodness I tested this before I sent it off to camp with my daughter. It didn't even make it through the night with a fresh set of batteries.
5,Better than it looks.,"It looks flimsy, but it did a great job. It has soft fins and completely safe, you can't hurt yourself. It does a great job at moving the air around a stuffy tent."
1,too small,"not worth the money ($20.00??), this fan is too small and unless you were to hold it inches from your face its useless, buy one of those handheld mini fans for $1.98!"
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money. This product is Cheap & loud. The fan is not balanced. Save your money and make a fan out of paper!
1,Don't waste your money! You can't feel any breeze.,"I bought this to have in the tent on ""warmer"" nights when camping. You can't feel any air flow unless you are an inch away from the fan! Considering the cost of batteries and the lack of air flow from this fan I can't recommend this product."
1,Used to be a great product,I bought one of these from Amazon 2 years ago and it was great.....quiet and long lasting on batteries!!! I have tried to get a second one from 3 different retail outlets (including Amazon) recently to have for power failures and camping (batteries last an entire 3 day weekend). The fan motor is now mounted very loosely in the housing which causes the fan to wobble which makes it extremely noisey. It seems the manufacturing process must have changed and what was a great product is no longer worth buying. All 3 fans had the same issue unlike my original which is very quiet. I have heard that Coleman is no longer the manufacture.
2,Noisy,"This fan moves air, barely. It makes ""white noise ;)"" which is ok IF you want noise when you sleep!"
1,Uses up battery power faster than it says,I saw one review where the person said this worked for 2 weeks on the same set of batteries. The product description says it will run for 21 hours on the same set of batteries.I did not have this experience.I purchased two of these fans and new batteries for them (each fan uses 4 D batteries. I spent $14 on 8 D batteries for the 2 units.) We went camping and turned the fans on when we went to bed in our tent. Woke up in the middle of the night and they weren't running. They ran out of juice sometime in the middle of the night. Wouldn't even make it one night. And this happened with both fans - both ran out about the same time. I estimate they made it about 6 hours. It was about 80 degree weather.
4,Fan is Great in a pinch,I own two of these Fans that we use in our 21 ft. Travel trailer we place as to create a cross wind in our trailer when we are camping with no hook ups and / or do not want to waste our Power on the A/C. It is defanitly a two fan job if needed for a large area. one would be good for a small tent.
2,"Weak and cheap, but is what it is","We bought two of these after Gustav hit this summer and we realized we'd be without power for weeks.They run fairly efficiently, when you can get the switch to stay in position. They'd run for several days on 4-D batteries when set to the low position. They also ran quite nicely on rechargeable alkaline batteries.They are too big to take camping, but we'll hang on to them for the next hurricane.Overall, I was disappointed with the build quality. They won't put up with any abuse, and I feel certain I'll be replacing the switch at some point. The exposed blade is soft foam and doesn't hurt, but is probably still not safe around little kids or cats."
1,"Fan didn't last, hardly used it.","I bought this fan about a month ago. I used it about 5 times for about 30-45 minutes each time. Then today, the fan would operate very slowly. Thought batteries were dead, but like other bad reviews about this fan, seems there is an electrical problem because changing batteries did not help. But, I will say that I left the fan in my car and that could have affected it, but looking at other reviews, it just seems that this fan is poorly build. Do not recommend. Do not buy."
3,Tent Fan,"You should measure the given dimensions so you have a clear perception of how big this fan is. (Its small.) And also the blades are made of a sort of bendable soft material, not metal. The fan itself is made of plastic. Not Metal. So this is a cheaply built fan that could easily break during packing or in a moment of curious exploration by the kids, have the blades detached and render the unit useless. But as far as air output, if you take care of the fan, it will do fine for those occasional power outages or hot nights in the tent."
1,Garbage.,"I purchased this fan last year from amazon for a summer camping trip. It functioned for fewer than five total hours before failing completely on the first day of use. Even a full change of batteries couldn't get it to work again. Buying this item is essentially taking a gamble on Coleman's quality control, which according to many other reviews, is highly inconsistent (for this item at least). I would not recommend this product at all."
1,"bad product, don't buy it.","doesn't work. the blow function is very poor.It is very expensive against the experience that you expected.heavy with batteries, expensive product. I bought several years agoother Coleman fan at same price and works very well."
1,Defective fan,"I am returning this fan since it never worked out of the box. I even tried different sets of D batteries and verified them in flashlights.Given the other negative reviews, I would not recommend the time or money on this item. Very sad and disappointed in Coleman, which usually produces very good products."
1,Not Good,"Used this fan 3 or 4 times. Does not work now. Changed batteries, still doesn't work. Coleman product. Thought it would be great!"
2,Not the quality I expected from Coleman,"We bought two of these fans after a particularly hot camping trip. They are compact, and light (until you put in 4 D batteries). We used them twice, and one of them just quit. I grew up using high quality Coleman gear, and these simply don't live up to the Coleman reputation."
4,Handy Fan,This is a great little fan for the outing. It work very well in place you wouldn't think it would work. So if need a small fan that work great outside or in this fan would be a good for your needs.
3,Broke after just a few uses,"Never was a super powerful fan, but gave a little air circulation. After just a couple uses it stopped working. Replaced the batteries but it won't even turn on anymore."
4,Works but uses batteries,"The good thing is that it is safe since the blades are foam. It blows enough air around to get circulation through the tent, but only cools if it's close to you. I wish it had a power adapter because I usually have power on my camp sites. It takes D batteries which makes it heavy and you have to deal with batteries while you're camping. It's good that it takes batteries, but should also have a power adapter so I gave it only a 4 star."
4,good fan,I got this fan for a mission trip I was going on where we didnt know if we would have electrical outlets to plug in fans. I used this fan along with 2 others and this one put out the most air and I didnt have replace the batteries which I did in the other one. I will use it again and recommend to others who need battery operated fan.
2,2 out of 3 either broke or defective after 1 day...,"Ordered two of these initially but when one of them arrived broken (the plastic piece holding the blade to the rotor was broke) it was returned for a replacement. Then we went camping for one night. The next morning only one of the two fans were still working properly, the other was not moving at all. Changed batteries, still didnt work, changed batteries again, now it worked... but could barely move it's ""low"" setting. Upon returning home, went ahead and returned all these fans. Didn't even want to keep the working one because a 1 in 3 success rate doesn't spell confidence... figured it was just a matter of time (days?) before the working one would stop working. If they all had worked properly, I probably would have given these 3 stars. They just dont move the air much unless your about a foot away."
5,It's Great!,"I'm not sure why I decided to buy a mariachi CD, I just started thinking about it. I researched who was the best, and these guys kept coming up. I actually saw these guys at EPCOT a few years back. They were great! The album is so cool. I can't understand a single word, but I still love it! This is some of the best I've ever heard. XXV Anniversario is really good as well. Buy it! It'll put a smile on your face!"
3,Too Polished and Over Produced,"I love mariachi music but was looking for something simple, emotional, and earthy. The vocals and instrumentals were excellent on this CD, but they have no feeling or emotion. I was looking for a modern version of Jose Alfredo Jimenez or Vicente Fernandez, instead this CD sounds more like a symphony. I prefer the street musicians to this kind of synthetic, over produced mariachi music."
4,A Contemporary Version That Is Not,"I am generally satisfied with this edition of Spurgeon's Morning and Evening. However, I bought it for a relatively new Christian, so I was drawn to that part of the title which reads, ""A Contemporary version of a devotional classic."" Not everyone can read Spurgeon's florid, Victorian prose with ease. I was quite disappointed then to find out that the text had not been altered, at least not in any significant way. It still had all the '-eths' and the thee's and thou's. Still a nice edition, but the 'Contemporary' in the title is misleading at best. Let the buyer beware!"
3,Graphic Doesn't Mean It's Good,"For starters, I love Laymon. However, this is one of his weaker books. The story is a bit ridiculous and way over-the-top. Yes, it has all the classic Laymon elements... unrelenting suspense, heaps of gore, extreme violence, graphic nudity, etc. But this time his work felt forced. At times it needed some editing and the ending was predictable and slightly anti-climactic. It was still a fun read, but not a Laymon classic. For new readers, start with ""In the Dark"" or ""Island"" to get a better feel for his mastery."
2,enjoyable possibly?,"I would give this five stars if there wasn't so many confusing and /or annoying typos. I wish he had a real editor instead of a highschool dropout. The story was good, very good actually if only it could be read without guessing what he is trying to say 1/5th of the time. Each of the books I have read by him have minor errors but this is the worst one yet. I don't know if I want to continue dishing out almost $7.00 to be confused."
4,A Very Good Chase Novel (although not Laymon's best),"This book is about a gang of thrill-killers and the two young survivors of their most recent attack.Like most of Laymon's novels, ""Endless Night"" is fast-paced. It's a very quick read. You'll probably want to read it in only 2 or 3 sittings.Although I agree with some of the negative points made by a previous reviewer, I don't agree with his 2 star rating. I'd give it 3 and 1/2 or 4 stars.The book is definitely worth reading. However, I recommend some of his other books more highly, including ""Body Rides"", ""Island"", and ""The Traveling Vampire Show."""
3,"Very fast, violent, and depraved","During the chase sequences this book reads very, very fast. I've read a lot of Laymon and the violence and sexual depravity here may be his personal high point. Very tense with lots of scares."
3,Ugh,"Where do I start? Well, the reason I give this book 3 stars is because it is Richard Laymon's own creative work. It IS his most sadistic, violent, repulsive novel I think. It was an OK read but... I just felt like I needed a shower and a Sunday Mass after I was done (I'm an atheist by the way). I have no problem at all with violent games, books, movies, etc, but this is just way overboard. (I even hate writing that, the overboard thing) and I hate when people complain about stuff like that. If you don't like it, turn the radio dial, turn off the TV, turn the video game off,or close the book. I wanted to close it a few times, but I read it til the end. I was curious."
1,Will NOT fit Sportster model SP-R2,"Product description is not adequate. This carry case does not and will not fit an SP-R2 Sirius radio. I believe that a better description than ""Compatible with all Sirius receivers with universal docking ports"" should be provided or explain the ""universal"" part."
3,Doesn't Fit Starmate 4 Snugly,"This case is designed for the larger Plug N' Play receivers such as the Sportster 3 & 4. Shorter profile receivers, such as the Starmate 3 & 4, will fit in this case, but will have about two inches of wiggle room at the top. In other words, it will not fit snug in the case and has room to move. Additionally, the clip that holds the flap to the case is magnetic, yet it isn't strong enough to pull the flap in unless it is buckled in carefully.Otherwise, this case is great if you carry your receiver around between car and house, or anywhere else."
5,Journey to a big league lockerroom from a unique perspective,"Simply, there are three main reasons to read this book One, it provides the reader with an inside look at the lifestyle of Major League Baseball Players. This is especially interesting because the Krukker is not the stereotypical mold for a baseball player, physically, or as you will know when you finish the book, he has a more humble attitude then baseball players are given credit for. It really makes you wish you could live your life playing baseball Two, it is hysterical, especially the second or third time you read it (I have read it at least 5 times) Three, even non-baseball fans can appreciate this down to earth look at life generally."
3,Good but overall uninspired,This album is a fine piece of work of straight ahead rock 'n roll. The guitar playing is great and overall the music is sound. Preventing this album from getting 4 or 5 stars is the fact that there really doesn't seem to be any highlights. The songs are good but in my book there needs to be something that stands up and gets your attention. Nothing here seems to stick in your head and one song seems to blend into another. Overall David Zaffiro put out 4 solid albums and this is one of them. If you're a Bloodgood fan (of which David was the founding lead guitar player) or got turned onto David after he went solo I think this is still worth the money if for no other reason than the fact that he's vowed to not put out any more albums again as he's a producer now.
3,Night light,Product is exactly what I was looking for but made kind of cheap. Most night lights are in all fairness. It comes apart very easily and my son has broken it 3 times (i've glued it back together). Cute but not good quality. The light works so it's doing it's job.
3,Heats unevenly,"Now, to my knowledge there is not a better lefse griddle out there, but to be honest I am not overly impressed with mine (sadly). I've used it to make pancakes a few times and spent an afternoon this fall making lefse with my family, and it consistently has the same issue: the griddle works great while the heating element is engaged and bringing the surface up to the desired temperature, but as soon as it reaches the temp you have it set at the heating element disengages and then the surface doesn't hold the heat enough to continue cooking, so it slows markedly until it engages again. I don't know if others have had this trouble or if mine is worse than average, but I was kind of disappointed in it's irregular performance."
3,lefse grill,"My new lefse grill has not even come out of the box. So I can't really rate it. I ordered all my lefse making stuff at the same time, every thing arrived when it was suppose to, except the grill. Heritage sent me a second one. but I didn't get it tell after christmas. so we cooked our lefse on a cast iron grill. When I get around to tring it, I may love it. But for now I haven't even taken it out of the box."
3,Fragance ok,It was smaller than I thought it would be. & it took to longer to get it.I am glad to f ind a source to order it from since local stores - Walgreens (Greenfield) & Wal-Mart) Greenfield won't stock it.They only stock cologne..
2,a good film but not a good adaptation,"I'll have to disagree with most of the reviewers of this latest effort of translation Dickens' classic story. First of all, there are too many important scenes ommited. Also, some important charcters of the original stories have become so one dimentional that their presences seem not revalent at all. Pitt's sister Geogiana, who is supposed to be so vivid in the book, has been reduced to a totally dull character without any emotion. Anyway, I would suggest everyone to go back to the 1946 David Dean's version, which is far superior than this 1999 one."
2,The Production is Great......But dont Buy this DVD,"Even though I have never read the book I found this Production very good.I would recommend this to any one who is a Dickens Fan but do youself a favour and dont buy this DVD release.As a British review on Amazon uk site indicated this DVD looks as if it was copied straight off the TV and also the commentary in the beginning and end of the movie telling us about the Great Expectations novel made the DVD worse.Masterpiece Theatre has spoiled this Great BBC Production of Dickens Great Expectations with it's Commentary (even though they think they are being helpful- but are not) and poor DVD.Four Stars for the Production itself but giving this Two stars because of the DVD quaility.Wait until BBC Release a DVD of the Production and the DVD quaility will be much, much better.I will be selling this DVD and wait until BBC release the DVD in Australia."
2,Disappointing Rendition,"I guess I'm the only one disappointed in the Masterpiece Theater adaptation of Great Expectations, but I was. Ioan Gruffudd is a fine actor, but he is no Pip. The only aspect of his portrayal I liked was his devotion to Estella. Even his horror at discovering the identity of his real benefactor was too ""subtle"" and too short-lived.I was even more disappointed in Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham. She was too young, too soft-spoken, and too kindly -- not at all cold and distant -- and not at all manipulative. And the scene of her incineration is terribly overdone.From the beginning ... in which we are told of Pip's visit to the graveyard ... to the end ... which is not at all in keeping with the spirit of Dickens' ambiguous ending ... this was a true disappointment.The Anthony Calf, Anthony Hopkins production for the Disney Channel is far superior. I wish that one were offered for sale."
4,"Very strange, but captivating!","I originally only watched this movie because Ioan Gruffudd, my favorite actor is in it. I saw him in Horatio Hornblower (which I reccomend you see also) and he was breathtaking. So I figured that Great Expectations would be just as wonderful. It was very good, but not as interesting as HH. Ioan, again, played his part with an enormous amount of emotion. But I can see why Horatio Hornblower won and the Emmy and not Great Expectations. Don't get me wrong, it certainly held my interest, I watched it both nights on PBS that it was on. But it was slightly strange. I can't see why it ended the way it did. (You'll have to see it to understand what I'm talking about!) But I did enjoy it, and reccomend it to anyone who likes Charles Dickons and period pieces."
3,I Had Higher Expectations,"This movie is decent, but takes many liberties with Dickens' story, and changes a lot about the characters. Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham is much too lucid, young, and sane - not to mention clean (this woman is supposed to have worn the same outfit for decades). There is a lot of footage of nature, which is silly, considering that so much of what was in the book had to be cut. Several specific incidents from the book are completely changed."
4,Great Expectations Box Set,This movie follows the book pretty well. My 8th grade students enjoyed it. We watched the movie before we read the book since sometimes the book can be hard to follow with the English flavoring in the language and the many characters. I would reccommend this movie.
4,I had Great Expectations...,"of this version of the classic. So dark and mysterious yet the costuming was lush and beautiful. It felt a bit rushed at some points, but the character portrayals were extremely well done. Highly recommend this one with Great Expectations."
5,The best version I've ever seen!,"Very much true to the original classic story, however some changes were made to make it more suitable for the entire family. The torture of Pip and his benefactor getting caught in the paddle of a steam boat could have been made into something truly gruesome, but it was not done that way. Instead what we have, is a beautifully cast production with outstanding actors putting on a very convincing performance, which mirror the original characters in the book with great precision. I was amazed with what I saw and became completely entrenched and swept away with the story, while at the same time reliving memories from the book. Yes, there is some variation, but it really adds to the story rather than taking anything away. Even Charles Dickens himself would be proud! It's that good! There are some very memorable scenes, for example, Pip seeing Estella again while she is wearing that Red Dress! If you read the book, everything in the film will have greater meaning."
3,good production . . bad dvd,"This latest version of Dickens' sprawling novel of love, jealousy, betrayal, and redemption is a faithful (or as much as possible, even in a 3-hr production) rendering. It is well cast, with Ioan Gruffudd as the most handsome Pip on film, and Charlotte Rampling giving her usual regal performance as Miss Havisham.Production design is good, with grim revisionist views of 18th century London typical of modern adaptations. Photography is first rate.What is unacceptable is that the DVD is, apparently, recorded straight off the PBS broadcast -- just as if you recorded it yourself -- complete with all the ads for Mobil, lugubrious intoductions by the pedantic host of Masterpiece Theatre, and PBS icons lingering for 30 seconds at a time throughout the film. Distracting, annoying, and unacceptable.Order the Region 2 disc from the BBC if you can play it. One should not pay a high price for a DVD that one could record off the air, and is little more than an ad for Mobil and PBS."
2,bad DVD production,The video quality of this fine adaptation is terrible. I've been waiting years for a DVD release only to be dissapointed by the poor video transfer to DVD.
5,One of my favorite Deuter albums,"This one has a mesmerising, transporting sequence of bell-like tones--I have every Deuter album I have found, and this one is definitely special among this talented soul's many beloved works."
4,volume shredder,"Our office has lots of old files that need destruction. This machine chews through paper. It takes large volumes and keeps going. You will tire before the shredder will. It does not jam with 30+ pages at a time. My son decided to pack a huge number of pages at once and succeeded in jamming the device. It was quite a challenge to clear. The strip shred allows continuous shredding however it does bulk the waste as compared to the confetti cut. It does require changing the bag more frequently or compressing the shreddings in the bag. Overall, we are happy at the tremendous capacity of the machine."
3,Could have been better,"Though sheldon use to be my favourite fiction author, thisis not one of his best books. I felt like reading excerptsfrom his old books. He is running out of ideas?Not yet read Morning, Noon and NIght"
4,FASCINATING.,"Mr. Sheldon takes us on an insightful trip through the daily lives of three woman doctors which fate brings together. Slow at first, yet expertly woven and masterfully told."
1,Nothing Lasts Forever- Including This Book,"Good grief. If Sheldon weren't dead I'd sue him for the time I wasted reading this. Episodic, contrived, 0 character development. I cared nothing for any of these characters, and raced through the second half of the book using the old trick of reading just the first sentence of each paragraph, and missed nothing.This is just the type of thing you'd see on TV- hey, wait a minute, maybe that's why he wrote this in the first place. You gotta respect the man's productivity- he's had his fingers in more entertainment industry pies than any 10 other successful creative artists. But what a lame book..."
1,Operation: Women doctors,"We've got doctors, we've got problems. Put 'em together and we've got Nothing Lasts Forever.Nothing about 'Nothing...' stood out to me as notable or special. Distinguishing marks there ain't. The characters were two-dimensional and the storylines felt like bare bones structures that needed more fleshing out in order to call them Sheldon's own. It would have been better if the book wasn't written almost entirely in snippet-style; maybe then there would have been more of a complex plot and developed characters.Even though it was (obviously) a novel, it read like the screenplay of a movie or soap opera. I could imagine the music that would be played during the scenes, and what it would look like picture-wise. Not because of amazing descriptive powers, but because it felt like worn-out standards I've seen hundreds of times. We even get the whole sentence or two summary of what all happened to everyone at the end. Please spare me."
4,a good read,"I enjoyed this book by Sidney Sheldon. In fact I have enjoyed about every book that I have read by this author. It is a very good read with finelyl portrayed characters.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Medical room drama with fast plot and plenty suspense.,"I had to read this book for a research project. It is the only book I've ever enjoyed and finished that I had to read in any English class in 4 years. I read it in less than 3 hours and I'm no speed reader, I just couldn't put it down. True, some of the stuff leaves you thinking, ""Yeah, right,"" but it was still good."
5,THE BEST!,"i'm sixteen and till now i have read 5 sidney sheldon books. they were all GREAT, however, Nothing lasts forever was the best of them. i loved it, the characters and the way the story develpoed...mr.sheldon is a master story teller! the book was flawless and i honestly couldn't put it down. i certainly recommend this book to everyone cuz it's not more or less than PERFECT."
5,Sidney's the master of storytelling,"I like the way Sidney changes your opinion about Gus, a lawyer and of course Pagie (a doc). It's really impossible to read Sidney's mind and he is an unprecedented Master of Suspence. Let him take you on a rollercoaster ride!"
4,This was terrific!,"I liked the idea of starting the story with her trial. It grabbed my attention and made me want to read the whole story. I loved the ending, too!"
2,deoressing,I found the book to be a little depressing. I read for fun and to escape life's drama like to be entertain
4,nothing Last Forever,I enjoyed this very much. It kept my interest and made it hard to put it down. I will keep it and read this book again.I
5,Voices of Modern Life,"This is an extraordnary collection of short stories from a writer with not just one great voice but a whole range of distinct voices. One feature of this collection of short stories is that each one of them come from entirely different perspectives and situations, told in an appropriately pitched voice, much like Hemingway's _In Our Time_, the modern standard for first publications of short stories. Like the previous reviewer says, Curnutt will, yes, be a name that you see again and again because, unlike much writing today, his doesn't seem to suffer from the corporatate dumbing-down that is so rife in American publishing today. His spare but energetic style is so original, it would seem impossible to market like the newest flavor of toothpaste or a new and improved facial tissue. It is the real deal. Read this book."
5,Guy,This is the best monitor I have ever owned. The graphics and colors are outstanding. I do a lot of photo editing using Photoshop and with this monitor's color management; I am now printing photos that are the closest to true color that I have ever seen. Recommend for anyone that is serious about getting true color for photography or graphics uses.
1,poor version,The subtitles obscured the important picture. Do not waste money to buy. I hate it. It need to buy the original.
2,Versions of Faure's Requiem,"I meant to be ordering a different recording of Gabriel Faure's Requiem. Somehow this version, which is not a great performance by any means, was among the list of versions of the one I wanted from various vendors. So I ordered it. That's not a problem with the vendor, but with Amazon, I think. Roger Ridgway"
1,Not Helpful,"This book does not give you enough information to really start your own training program. What information the book does give is outdated or not sufficient. It does talk about how to implement a program, but it does not give you the nuts and bolts you need to actually create a training program. Unfortuantely, my purpose in reading the book was to learn how to create a program for a small, new, growing business. Luckily, I have found other books that do a better job of explaining the whole process such as the book ""Beyond the Podium.""Recommendation: Skip Nilson's book."
4,James Taylor's Greatest Hits,"This book of sheet music is ideal for the acoustic guitar player who wants to learn more about the ""James Taylor Style"" of playing.Taylor uses many guitar chords in his songs that are not normally seen by the everage guitar player. Every song in this collection of his early hits has specific chord diagrams to help you through the difficult learning process.I have gotten many hours of pure enjoyment from this book and anticipate many years of the same.If you are a James Taylor fan, this is a ""must buy."" You will not regret it!"
3,Definitely Unusual,"""The Hallelujah Side"" is indeed an interesting and unusual book dealing with a rare subject: an extremely stigmatized religion as seen through the eyes of a little girl who has never known anything else. The story takes many funny turns as Roxanne Fish, the main character, attempts to balance religion and rock n' roll. Definitely worth a read."
2,My review of The Hallelujah Side,"I did not find the book to be a good read. References to the Assembly of God Church were too negative and demeaning. Nothing ""happy"" at all about the book!"
3,Not for Macbook,I purchase this primarily to access a new Macbook purchased May 2012 in order to access the back panel to upgrade the RAM. The 00 phillips screw-driver is too large for the back panel access screws. Otherwise the package arrived on time and the tools are of good quality.
2,This book is disappointing.,Nattie Gold is a fun character but the book is not very absorbing and the writing not engaging enough to support a so-so plot.
4,A good mystery that happens to be about horses,"So many horsey mysteries and pretty weak on plot and character but Jody Jaffe's debut novel covers all the bases. I found it had to put down, and even my un-horsey mom enjoyed it. Can't wait to pick up the next one."
2,Looking for TAPI? This book is not the answer.,I bought this book to learn about TAPI. It does not provide much more than MSDN on this topic. The sample code is also not explained very well.
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"This CD is just as an avid CrossMovement follower would expect. Their sick rhymes continue with ""Higher Definition."" I believe they have a better flow and better rhymes than any secular hip-hop artist to date. On top of that, their Gospel message is outstanding. You'll love this CD, especially if you're a teen like me and like Hip-Hop and Rap. The Bible says to use whatever flava to get out God's message. Some dont like Christian Rap, however if you are young most likely you will LOVE this cd. Their amazing legacy continues!!! Upon hearing ""It's Time"" on the Cross Movement site, I immediately ordered this CD along with their newly signed artist Flame with his debut ablum, ""Flame"". I suggest both of these CDs. Two purchases that no one will regret. God Bless!!! -df"
3,I like CM so much...,"but I gotta be honest. I don't think that this CD is better than say, Heaven's Mentality. And believe me when I say that the message is the same regardless of the songs, so its all good. But if we're rating based on everything, i.e. beats, hooks, flow, etc, etc, there are only about 3 joints on here that I play over and over. Of course any song with the Ambassador stands a chance of being hot. Phanatik brought it on Epiphany, another joint I like. The Cypha was alright on this one, but not the hottest I've heard from them. That being said, CM could put out country music and I'd still cop it."
4,Pretty Good Album...,"I'm just starting to get into gospel rap, considering the new talent that's now starting to emerge. I've yet to hear a Cross Movement album that I can listen to from beginning to end without interruption, and this one is no exception. My favorite song up here is 'Lord You Are', which is one of the best 'rap songs' I've ever heard period. The lyrics are definately on point and the Message is direct and easy to understand. If they can make the lyrical content and production mesh a little better, I'm sure they can make a truly genuine and perfect album. Still, this is definately a great inclusion in the Cross Movement discography."
2,Folded in half to ship!,"I ordered this mattress because we got a bassinet second-hand that was supposedly larger than most other bassinets. The fit was perfect HOWEVER, the mattress had been folded in half for shipment. It had a huge fold in the middle of it and wouldn't lay flat. After leaving it out of the box for 2 days, the mattress was mostly flat but there are still creases at the edges and I can only place it into the bassinet one way or else it pops up in the middle. I contacted the company and they simply instructed me to leave it flat and it would resolve itself. If I had more time before the baby comes, I would definitely return it. Which is a shame because it's really a nice mattress other than the giant crease in it from shipping... It would be so easy for the company to ship it a different way to avoid this problem but they don't seem like they plan to do this anytime soon so please beware!"
3,not for bearded dogs,"The idea of this contraption is that dogs don't care for citrus scent and when they bark it would activate the sprayer underneath the dogs throat and spray an unpleasant smell to condition your dog not to bark. What we didn't consider was our dogs' grooming.Schnauzers have beards. This product was not effective for us - I think in part because the spray was caught in the dogs' beards, never getting to their noses. We were unwilling to shave the dogs to see if it would be more effective. What we were left with were lemon-fresh pups."
1,still barking,had NO effect on my 65lb puppy. Car was filled with the wonderful smell of lemon. The dog smelled wonderful but he barked my ears off. We had folks check the collar placement. Everything worked but the barking never stopped
1,does not work for small dogs,"We have a mini-dashchund and the only times that the spray goes off are random times. When our dog barks it does not go off, but when he does random stuff like shake or scratch his body it seems to go off.I really wish I could return this product but since we already threw away the packaging we can't.I would not recommend anyone with a small dog to get this collar."
3,Nice air freshener!,"I used this on an older dog that was very set in her ways. She has very loose skin and thick fur on her neck and it did not spray every time she barked. I think it would work better if it had better contact. We could have shaved her fur at the contact point, but we gave up. It did freshen the room nicely! She would sneeze when it went off, but it did not completely stop the barking. She is quite a stubborn bone head! It was comical to watch her."
5,bark collar,"This is a very effective bark collar. It worked immediately for us. I just put it on our dog, let her outside, she began to bark, then stopped immediately. I like it better than the ones that shock because I feel that it is much more humane. It uses the spray of an unpleasant odor rather than the pain of a shock."
1,citronella no bark collar,"The collar was way too big for a miniature schnauzer. We did trim it following the directions and used it. When it worked it did make him stop barking but it had to be fussed with often. Refilling, retightening etc. It made him very wary and nervous when it worked. He learned quickly when it was on or off. Once he barked when my grandaughter was sitting by him and they both got sprayed no ill effects for either but a lot of complaining. It worked approximately 3 days. The 4 flashes light came on and won't go off. This indicates no fill. But even though I fill it ???? It won't work anymore. So I don't recommend this particular collar. It's way too much $$$ for 3 days of silence."
2,Did not help with barking but seems well made.,"I purchased this for my 20 lb. mix-breed and it has not helped at all. The first time that he barked with it on it made him jump, but he kept right on barking. I thought maybe I didn't have it adjusted correctly, so I refitted the collar to his neck. Didn't help a bit. He is a rather neurotic dog, so that might have something to do with it. I will say that the collar seems well made and sturdy. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow. I just wish the collar would have helped!!"
1,It Broke,"I'm not sure what happened, but this thing stopped working after a couple of weeks. We rarely used it, but one day it just stopped working. It wasn't the batteries and we added more ""juice"", but nothing. I would buy this from a store instead. At least, if it breaks, it's a lot easier to return."
4,"Fantastic Movies, Terrible Presentation","Boo, Warner Brothers!!!You've taken three amazing movies and packaged them terribly.I was extremely excited to have received this ""box set"" for Christmas, until I unwrapped it. It's three seperate loose DVDs with no box to tie them all together. And to add insult to injury, all of the DVDs are encased in the old-school type packaging with the cheap cardboard cover and black ""snap"" latch.Very disappointing. Warner Brothers SUCKS! They really need to work on how they showcase their work on DVD in the future. They could take a real hint from New Line which always releases their best films with pride and flair.As far as the movies go, they are amazing and packed with extras. It's just sad that they would call this a collection and not treat it as such."
5,"So much more than meets the eye,","you'll need to watch it several times to pick up on all of its charm and humor. We all know characters like the ones depicted in this movie. Seeing them on the screen makes it feel like watching your friends being comfortable being your friends.The humor is both blatant and subtle, and may not be everybody's taste. But if it is yours, you will enjoy it immensely.Guest plays the likable (lovable?) displaced Broadway wanna-be, transplanted in the midwest small town of Blaine, MO. Now in charge of making a show celebrating the town's 150th anniversary, Guest has delusions this show is the ticket to his return to Broadway. All he needs is the support of the town, his stars, and some money. What happens will captivate your attention, imagination, amusement, and heart.Check out Guest's original, ""This is Spinal Tap"", another classic mockumentary. Both are must-haves, and must-views again and again. Enjoy!"
5,Awesome!,"I love Christopher Guest movies, and the price for this collection was fabulous! We will watch them over and over, and I recommend them to anyone with a sophisticated sense of humor and an affinity for the movie topics -- community theatre, dog shows and folk music. GREAT STUFF!!!"
1,THIS IS THE STUDY GUIDE not the book.,"This is a ""study guide"" by Gordon Shilling that lists answers and solutions to odd numbered problems, not the Harshbarger/Reynolds textbook. The fact is subtly hinted at in naming the edition as ""paperback"" ""7th Study"".Somebody needs to learn not to stoop so low to sell textbooks at amazon.com"
1,Not the textbook!,"This is just the DVD support disks for the textbook. I bought this thinking it was the text. While they will probably come in useful, its not what I thought it was."
5,Simply the best,"Although written in 1929, it is still by far the best general account of the Societas Jesu. It touches upon all aspects of the jesuits and it is simply a pleasure to read. After reading it you have the feeling you have traveled 5 centuries and all contingents. Moreover, it is nonpartisan. Upon publication it was praised by the press on all contingents, by media from all religious angles and by freemasons' and jesuits' publications. Although often highly critical of the jesuits, they could not do otherwise than recognize the work of a master historian."
4,Dragging,"I bought this product years ago, still use it for testing acceleration in car. You plug it into the lighter socket, calibrate it, set it and stomp on the gas when it says start. You lift when it tells you have covered a quarter mile. It gives the ET MPH and horsepower. To bad you can't buy it any more on Amazon."
5,This book contains a bit of magic,It will recharge your batteries and give you a reason to smile. Emotional and thought provoking - this was the most fun I've had with a story in years. Herb's a real character and his outlook should inspire us all. Both of my thumbs are up.
5,A job well done Mr. Perkins!,"I really enjoyed ""Herb's First 100 Years & the Book of Truths"". What an uplifting, warm book. It was wonderful to see Herb's outlook on life, and I loved the part about the Ravens. I will be using ""The Book of Truths"" in my life to bring me laughter, thoughtfulness, and guidance. A job well done Mr. Perkins!Gayle Slover"
3,waaaaaayyyy too much information,"This book is exhaustive to the point of being exhausting - and as such isn't really useful for anyone who's traveled at least once overseas. The book is divided into sections on choosing destinations, surface transportation (100 pages!), air transportion (140 pages!), travel docs, safety and health, baggage, practicalities, the bottom line, and resources. Some of the information was useful - such on how to take advantage of open jaw airline tickets - but so much of it is a rehash of what every traveler knows. I mean, I didn't need to pay $22 to learn that I should use a credit card when making travel plans.For the novice - anyone else, pass on this one."
1,Just didn't live up to its legend,"As I began planning my RTW travels two years ago I kept hearing the refrain from family and friends, ""buy the nomad book!"" So, being an open minded sort of gal, I decided to try it on for size. Much to my disappointment this book was less about helpful travel tips and tales and more of Mr. Hasbrouck's long-winded but short-sited opinions. Like a previous reader said, I'd buy this book maybe for the airfare info--which is a bit outdated--and that's all. On second thought, you can get most of the airfare info from the Lonely Planet or Rough Guide books. I bought the nomad book... and was glad I left home without it."
4,Not for the chemically sensitive.,"I am only 10% of the way through this book, but I can tell you, don't buy it if you are likely to get a headache from the smell of cheap, stinky, shiny paper. I wish it were in the same format as other Moon Pubs. I have used, but alas, the printing job greatly detracts from what otherwise appears to be an excellent book."
2,Could have accomplished as much with half as many pages,"Overall this book was helpful in understanding a lot of the aspects of world travel, but it could have been half as long. The detailed info about air travel (over 100 pages!) was repetitive and not too useful. The authors anti-American, anti-US government, anti-big business bias got to be a bore after awhile. This book covered a lot of ground but World Stompers was a more useful book."
4,Supportive and dense with information,"I've traveled extensively but have learned something new on virtually every page of Edward Hasbrouck's The Practical Nomad. His style of traveling isn't for everyone but his tips acknowledge this and his advice can be adapted to many traveling styles. I particularly like Hasbrouck's supportive prose. He genuinely wants everyone to be able to enhance their travels and challenge themselves to learn more about the world around them. He doesn't show off about his own travels and he doesn't make it a competition of extremes. Some sections will be extraneous for most travelers (""folding kayaks""?) but they're always interesting and Hasbrouck makes the reader believe that round the world travel is possible for everyone."
5,Best travel book I have ever read,"If you travel overseas, whether for business or pleasure, short term or lengthy stays, you should check out this book. Covers everything that you need to know that area-specific guide books do not discuss."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I had read some essays by Hasbrouck before and I enjoyed them. So I thought I'd read his book. The information he provides is helpful and fascinating...and fairly well organized considering the details that go into planning a trip. However, he fails to address about a quarter of his target audience, ""Women traveling alone made up 24 percent of all our customers."" He states this at the beginning of the book, but ignores the needs of that 24%. I even checked the index and table of contents for advice for women travelers, only to find three, brief resources, about which he says, ""On the whole, most of these resources are more oriented toward tours..."" In the preface, Hasbrouck says he collected all of his information from ""experiences of thousands of travelers..."" Were they all men? Even if he can't address issue that female travelers might face, at least he could have drawn on those ""experiences of thousands of travelers."""
2,Misleading Title,"This book is an encyclopedia of travel including a lengthy discussion of how the travel industry operates. However, the specifics on how to travel around the world are only covered superficially. After reading this book and the Rough Guide equivalent, one may conclude that the definitive book on around-the-world travel has yet to be researched and written."
4,Fresh ideas for grilling,"This is a great cookbook for someone who wants to expand their grilling beyond 'dogs and burgers. Written with a wry sense of humor and good advice on drinks to accompany the act of grilling and the meal itself, it's lots of fun and makes a good gift. Emphasis is on southern-style BBQ but there's some Asian influences, and the author plays around with exotic ingredients in the marinades (green mango, for example.) Also receipes for side dishes."
3,Not too thrilled!,"I have read and own many grilling books much better than this one.Too many ""far out"" recipes for the average griller and I am veryexperienced with this kind of cooking. Keep it simple is the bestthing to do with a good piece of meat or wonderful fresh vegies."
2,This aint no BBQ book!,"After having read a couple supposed ""impartial"" reviews of this book on the net and in other print mediums, where it was hailed as the Bible of BBQ, I ordered this book and its sequel ""License to Grill"". My opinion? I WASTED MY MONEY. This book has very very little to do with BBQ. If my memory is correct, it has about 5 recipies or so dealing with real BBQ. Im not talking grilling, im talking barbequeing... and those shopping for a BBQ probably know the difference. As grilling books go, its alright. (thus why i didnt give it only 1 star), but the book would have been better titled as ""The carribean grill"". The whole book is about grilling carribean style. This applies little to someone seaking a true BBQ book. This book is WAY overhyped in the BBQ/grilling community. (this review based upon my reading of about 8 BBQ cookbooks, a dozen webpages, several FAQs)"
5,Cooking out in the open!,"'Creative', 'Original' and 'New' are often recipes for disaster, but 'Thrill' is sauced-up here! S&W explore a cuisine as old as Neanderthal, with ingredients as simple and fresh as your grocer's morning delivery. Give your culinary tap-root a deep watering with ""The Thrill of the Grill"". Submitted by Michael Dean Olsen (Calliste@juno.com"
2,A huge let down!,"Admitedly, I am a big fan of Steve Raichlens' work, but I have read quite a number of other grilling/BBQ books, not to mention watching DVD's and such. This book was so hyped in many reviews, that I put it at the top of a new pile of 5 books on the subject to read, only to wonder what I missed! I agree with the review above that says it should be titled 'Carribean Grill'. Nothing wrong with that sort of flavor, just don't tout the book to be all grilling/BBQ inclusive. It's not! I only garnered a handful of recipes from the entire book. Borrow it before you buy it."
2,intricate source,while this is a most useful and effective BBQ book it is not for novices. At least I found it to be a little more intricate than what I was looking for. I am new at BBQ and wanted really simple useful everyday receipes.
3,Not the simple down home recipes I was expecting,"For the adventurous in BBQ I might recommend this book, but for those that want simple fare I would not. Most of the pages are full of delicious recipes but they take ingredients that may not be stocked in a simple pantry and are time consuming. There are a lot of meats used that most people would not have access to or would never consider putting on the BBQ.I also thought this would be good for the owner of the combo smoker/grill but it really isn't."
3,A note about SPEED,"The vinyl version sounded good at 33 or 45. The band must have preferred 33 because that's what we get here. Their early work (up through ""Quique"") was a unique blend of electric and electronic sound, but by 1994 they were moving away from guitars. This EP was colder, sparser, a step into pure electronica."
1,Doesn't work,"This device never works, except in the random times it turns itself on when no one is trying to use it. Bought it for a young family member, and she was very sad that it did not work for her."
4,MP3 player,"I ordered 3 of these for my daughters and one of them would not work from the start. The warranty from the Manufacturer states you have to send it back at your own expense and they will review it. The process would take around two weeks, according to the representative I spoke with on the phone. I think my having to pay shipping to send back for a manufacturing defect is unacceptable.Fortunately I took it apart and found the defect myself. The ""on"" switch was not connected. That was corrected and now all are working and the girls love them."
4,Christmas 2010 Gift,I don't have any problems with this product. I bought it as a Christmas gift though so I don't really know anything about it yet. I'm sure it will be great though. It is for a 6 year old so you can't go wrong with it. I had to mark stars so I am guessing on it all based on looking at the product.
4,Complicated but a good book.,"I'm no expert in happiness or being, but I must admit I enjoyed the book. It made me think. I don't know if I was any happier but certainly enlightened."
5,"A welcome reissue, minus the Orff sample...","The original version of 'Naive' had to be yanked from the shelves due to an uncleared sample of Carl Orff's ""Carmina Burana"" being used in ""Liebeslied."" A subsequent ""cleaned"" version, 'Naive - Hell to Go,' was released, and both eventually went out of print. Now, we have a compilation of sorts - the entirety of the original 'Naive' MINUS the Orff sample (ergo the ""edit"" designation on ""Liebeslied"") and the unique tracks from the 'Naive - Hell to Go' album. Still, this reissue sounds great, although I'm still holding onto my previous version of 'Naive,' if only to give the Orff people a middle-finger salute."
5,The definitive book on Leslie Charteris and the Saint,"Burl Barer's examination of Leslie charteris' THE SAINT in books, TV, comics and film, more than deserved the Edgar Award it was given by the Mystery Writers of America. If you are a fan of Simon Templar, you have to buy this book"
3,Good but lopsided,"The book is a thorough review of Simon Templar's complicated history on film and television. I do wish more attention had been paid to his origins and development in print, though. He is, and always will be, Leslie Charteris' idealized alter ego."
5,Best Advice I 've Ever Read,"My neighbor gave me this book & I read it over the weekend. I was shocked that I was the reason I am still single. I was blaming all the ""bad men"" for my single marital status. The advice is good, thorough, and simple. You can change your patterns that will enable you to open up to meeting the people you really deserve to date. This book identifies the patterns, discusses ways to change and reinforces with examples. I am gifting this book to all my single friends!"
5,Strong and Powerful,"Experience is always the best and worst teacher. Fortunately, for readers, the author has compiled her knowledge and the experiences of others for us and plans it out very simply (even though it's hard!). If you are ready to change, you will be truly enlightened by this book. The points give you back ownership of what you have done and make you realize that you are not alone. And that you aren't stupid! Great book. I would highly recommend and have already. My favorite line in the book is paraphrased as the following: ""If you are working on yourself and doing what you can for yourself, then you are loveable."" And then she repeats it. It's very powerful for those of us who may not actually, consciously believe that. Read it!"
1,Sad,"I wonder how many men and women have been scared away from even thinking about a relationship with God because of the inane prattle of Pat Robertson. As a Christian myself, Robertson embarrasses me. His blood and thunder god has the temperament of a five year old child and about as much judgement. Robertson continually dishes out his poison all the while blinking with his eyes half closed, his mouth twitching, and this idiotic **** eating grin.If he didn't influence so many, he would just be another sad joke. But unfortunately people listen to this man talk of praying away hurricanes, how Hurricane Katrina and 9/11 occured because of God's wrath, how the citizens of Dover, Pa. can't expect God's help because they turned their backs on God and on and on and on. He opens his mouth and dumb falls out.Please don't judge all Chrsitians on the basis of people like this. We aren't all ignorant and we don't all hate everyone who disagrees with us."
1,Horrible,"This book is astonishingly poor. Characters are primitive and underdeveloped. Plot develops in jumps. I must admit the idea is not too bad, but the result is horrible. Waste of time....."
2,Unreliable mouse and keyboard,"The mouse and keyboard worked fine for the first few days I had them, but then the mouse started constantly losing its connection with the wireless receiver, and the ""t"" key on the keyboard became unresponsive. Also, the media buttons seem to be tied to Windows Media Player, with no way to reprogram them for compatibility with other programs. If you're using some other software to play music and you hit the play/pause/stop buttons, Windows Media Player will open. Dissatisfied."
1,Dud!,"This item stopped working after six months... Amazon goes three months out on warranty only. Buyer beware, it's not that great of product to start with, very limited range and sucks up AA's in no time..."
1,It's a scrubber... at least on me....more of a man's scent,"Usually I'm a pretty big fan of CSP, but Bois de Filao I cannot wear. It turned out to be a scrubber. Even after scrubbing I could still smell it. Literally Bois de Filao makes me sick at my stomach. Yes, I realized after I sprayed it on that it was more of a men's scent, even tho it's listed as unisex. Even on a man, I think only a man with a certain chemistry would be able to carry this one off. On my skin the patchouli totally overwhelmed every other note. Would not purchase again."
2,Poor DVD player and no MP3's,"I bought this TV/DVD combo assuming that it would play just about any disc that you put in it. You know, like the cheapest DVD stand alone dvd player you can buy does? Well beware, it does not play mp3's and has issues with almost all home burned DVD's I have put in it. I have a total of four stand alone DVD players, my Sony being the oldest (ancient) and they never have trouble with any home burned disc. This Toshiba has trouble with just about all of them (pixilates and then stops working) So as far as a TV goes... not bad. As far as DVD player... pretty disappointing. Although I have not had trouble with commercial DVD's to this point."
4,Nice little TV,"This is a perfect purchase for a small room. It works well, and is easy to use. The picture quality is good. My only warning is that it is small so it does not work in all situations."
1,Power Supply Problems,"This unit has a basic flaw in parts and/or design.Just before the warranty was up the power supply went out (TV wouldn't turn on). I still had to pay $75 for labor to get the unit fixed. Now, only a little more than a year later, the same problem has occured again. Only this time I had a DVD in the unit when it happened, and now there is no way to get the door open to recover my DVD. I am currently planning on taking a hammer to the unit to recover my DVD and cut my losses by buying a new unit....NOT TOSHIBA!!"
5,Great for traveling,"We bought this since we travel so much and often can't find a changing table (on planes, scary bathrooms, etc). When time for change, I graba diaper, wipes, etc and stuff them in the pocket of the tote. I grab my toddler and go. It is big enough to hold one set of items necessary for a change and folds out large enough to accomodate our tall 2 year old. Super easy to clean and fold back. Fits great in diaper bag or carry on luggage."
5,best show on televison,basically the dream life of every guy i know... fun to watch. why everyone should want to be a hollywood star.
5,One of the best series out there,"Entourage has a little bit of everything for everyone. The writing is simply amazing - one of the best in TV. There's plenty of attractive people (if that's your thing) and tons of guest stars (if that's your thing). Simply put, this is one of the best shows on TV."
5,Christopher Guest is a genius,"I adore all of the Christopher Guest movies. This may be the best one of them all, although obviously you may prefer others. The best part of the movies, of course, is watching all of them. The wonderful repertory cast that appears in all of them is perhaps the best part."
3,It was just o.k. to me,I guess I was expecting a little more with this movie although I did enjoy...just wasn't as good as Best In Show...(imo)
4,a great laugh!,"This movie was really funny to me, but it might not be quite as funny if you haven't seen other movies by this director. It is all improvised and done in the style of a documentary. All the characters are folk singers who were popular in the 60's, returning for a reunion concert. If you liked movies like ""This is Spinal Tap"" or ""Best in Show"", you'll love this one. The humor is very quick and dry, and definately not to be taken seriously. If you want a good chuckle without having to follow a deep story plot, it's a great movie."
3,A faux documentary,"Filmed in the format of a faux documentary of a tribute concert to the late Irving Steinbloom, commonly revered as the business pioneer of the 1960's popular folk music craze, THE MIGHTY WIND follows the various performers and family members during the two weeks leading up to the reunion opening night in New York City. While there are several good laughs (most were included in the trailers), the periodic humor failed to compensate for the movie's overall dullness. I was bored too quickly and felt this movie dragged on for too long. It could have been a better movie if at least 30 minutes of footage was deleted. I wanted to like this movie but it fell short of my expectations."
3,"Love the Cast, Liked the Movie","THIS IS SPINAL TAP is an undisputed classic. WAITING FOR GUFMAN has hilarious moments (the two favorites that come to mind: the old man auditioning by uttering obscenity-laden lines from RAGING BULL and Eugene Levy's crossing eyes when forced to perform without his glasses) and BEST IN SHOW really feels like they're hit the mark.I was excited to see A MIGHTY WIND but, I have to admit, I was a little disappointed when I did. Maybe my expectations were too high. I chuckled but didn't see any homeruns. The problem: they've so painstakingly recreated the kind of lame PBS-styled folk show that...it actually feels like a lame PBS-styled folk show.When I saw it on cable recently, I could even flip back and forth between WIND and a lame folk show on PBS (which was actually a fun thing to do!).The weird thing about it is: every time it's on, I can't help but watch it. And I laugh harder each time.Anybody else?"
3,Pleasant Breeze,"Christopher Guest wrote, directed and stars in this send-up of over-the-hill folksingers reuniting for one last concert. All the amusing character actors you know from Guest's ""Best In Show"" and ""Waiting for Guffman"" are here, just not so funny this time.Eugene Levy plays Mitch, the spaced-out former partner of Catherine O'Hara. They are both very talented actors and improvisors; however, they needed a little more action in the plot to make us laugh. The wonderful Fred Willard plays a gushing manager with great success. Michael McKean is enjoyable as one third of a 60s folk trio.In fact, all of the actors are pleasant and usually laugh-out-loud funny. The script this time just doesn't have enough going on to sustain the humor, which is quite underplayed. While not a hysterically funny comedy, ""A Mighty Wind"" is comfortable, friendly, and full of such great actors that you enjoy it anyway."
1,the Spinal Tap Element didn't come enough for me,"I found this film Boring&the Humor didn't really move me at all.Eugene Levy who I find Funny seemed to be just kinda there for me.I was hoping for a Connection to the Beat Poets,&other elements of Folk Music&a take inside of what Bob Dylan was doing&about but this film stalled&lost it's movement really fast to me.this is Satire felt like Wierd Al was behind more so than somone who came up with Spinal Tap."
2,"Amusing, but not brutal enough","Where Spinal Tap took a comedic chainsaw to the excesses of metal music, A Mighty Wind uses a feather duster. In short, the humor isn't nearly brutal enough. Having been around the folk music scene, I could put together a funnier and much more surreal film from documentary footage."
2,A Mighty Miss,"Too much missing here, too much of the folk scene ignored, too many opportunities for conflict passed over. All in all it's a rather boring movie, but not quite as boring as its website.For us, Guest and Levy missed the essentials of the folk scene with it's ego-driven characters, its groupies, it's drugs, and it's battles between the traditionalists and the new folkies who were writing their own songs. As far as this movie is concerned, those things never happened, and the characters here had no visible lives between their folk days and their reunion days. Pretty bland.Can't recommend this one to anyone."
1,"horrible,horrible,horrible movie","This movie and the three others by this same writer/director are just horrible. Nerds acting like nerds is not funny unless they have good lines. The movies are just horrible, writing is idiotic, not funny."
2,A Weak Reiteration of Best of Show,"As a big fan of Best of Show, I watched this with great anticipation and came away flat.They used the same tried and true approach with a mockumentary style but somehow the tension of the characters of Best in Show just never materialized. None of the characters was engaging or even resonated.I'd skip this one."
1,SIMPLY BORING FOLKS,"Sorry folks, I did not laugh at all. It was depressing even. I am 46 years old and wished it was to recall the folk era but it did I did not see it as a comedy. But then I like Airplane and Austin Powers movies."
1,"Horrible movie, I'm so embarassed","I bought this movie as a gift for my brother because it was cheap, he likes folk music, and because 'Spinal Tap' and 'Best in Show' are hilarious. I'd never seen it, but since it came from the people who put out those movies, it had to be at least decent, right? WRONG!!This is the worst comedy I've ever seen in my life. There I was, after Christmas with my family, and we decide to pop it in. 'It should be great', I tell them. Then silence. Then my mom fell asleep. Then people decided to get up and get something to drink. Then my sister-in-law decides to 'turn in early'. Not one laugh from anyone the entire time.The only redeeming part about it was whether they were going to kiss at the end. Excuse me, if that's the only redeeming quality about a COMEDY, then that blows.God, I'm never buying a movie sight unseen again. Thankfully it wasn't my brother's only present."
3,COUNTRY TWANG,"Spinal Tap goes Folk! As the creators of the cult hit drop their obscure brand of comedy into the clean world of banjos & barbershops like an ageing hippies last trip.So is it funny? Taking its lead from Tap, it uses the same spoof-documentary format & while the story was planned before hand, all the scenes are improvised. Leaving the comic talent of Harry Shearer (Simpsons), Eugene Levey (Pie) & Christopher Guest (Tap) to never fail and always deliver.Yeah, but it's about Folk music! Don't be concerned as the story will have you splitting your guts with laughter & if the music isn't your bag to start with you'll be hard-pressed to stop toe tapping by the end."
3,"Better to buy ""Guffman"" or ""Show""","Guest and Co. can do better. Frankly, they look tired in this one."
2,Mighty Disappointed,"While I've greatly enjoyed the work of Guest, Levy, O'Hara, etc. in the past, I found this work sub-par. It looks like they put a lot of work into this mockumentary, effectively simulating realistic folk songs and singers, but the whole thing seemed like a very long set-up for a punch line that never came. I think they probably had a good concept, definitely good comic actors and good production techniques, but they forgot to bring the funny. Good for a couple of chuckles at best."
3,"Liked it, didn't love it.","As avid fans of Christopher Guest and his previous movies, my husband and I were eager to see A Mighty Wind. While it is entertaining, we found it nowhere near as inventive, scathingly accurate, or hyterically funny as Spinal Tap or Best in Show. The ending seemed pretty lame."
5,Best of the Bunch,"While I enjoyed Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show, A Mighty Wind is better because it is more subtle. The characters in Best of Show were often overdrawn, and the humor often descended into the kind of inanity found on MAD TV. Here, however, the characters are deliciously quirky but maintain an edge of believability. Some of the best scenes are genuinely moving, and you don't know whether to laugh or cry. The music is likewise excellent. How often does a satire include original songs that could have been hits in the genre being spoofed? The magic, here, is that the best satire is always loving satire. It always maintains a real affection for the target. (That, by the way, is also the magic of O Brother Where Art Thou.) In addition, the timing is excellent, and the writing is simply outstanding. If you haven't seen it, don't let anyone spoil the punchlines for you."
5,I'll keep it short and sweet. 4.5 Stars,No matter how many times I see this movie it still weaves its spell on me. I get misty every time Mitch and Mickey sing their feature song...So well cast and produced. A classic of our times.
3,silly and funny,"I thought this movie was fun mainly because I love all Christopher Guest movies,they are always full of subtle satire and the actors all act so natural as though they are just adlibbing most of it. The mighty wind was just another typical Guest satire on the folk music industry with all of its nerdiest and silly type casts the Guest loves to exploit and have fun with. Alot of fun and worth watching over in case you missed something the first time."
4,A Mighty Wind,This was a wonderful spoof on a special time in music. There is some good music on the video and fun to watch with a glass of wine and friends!
4,A decent follow up that makes me miss the dogs!,"`A Mighty Wind' is funny, it's actually really funny...it's just such a disappointment when you come off the brilliance that was `Best in Show'. So, `A Mighty Wind' follows the same mockumentary premise (I just love these type comedies) and it stars the same cast except instead of eccentric dog owners we have ex folk singers. So this famous record producer dies and to commemorate his life they decide to get his three biggest acts to reunite and perform a concert in his honor. `Best in Show' MVP Parker Posey is not the highlight this time around, instead it's Eugene Levy who plays Mitch like a constipated manic depressant. Jennifer Coolidge, while only in like 2 minutes of the movie, had me rolling on the floor especially when they are all humming. Great comedy that, while not up to par with it's predecessor, still makes quite the impression."
4,The perfect kiss,"In many ways this is a fair sequel to the peerless This Is Spinal Tap. It's certainly a much more understated effort in all respects, but there's no mistaking the humour: one can imagine few bands other than Spinal Tap being signed to a record company so cheap it didn't punch holes in the vinyl!Michael McKean and Christopher Guest play it pretty straight, so many of the choicest lines comes from the bit parts, and while it's not in the same league as 'Tap, there are some genuine gut-busters in there (one that particularly stuck for me was the pros and cons of playing in a garage band in Stockholm).I'm a little surprised that some have found the plot lacking: There was a clear dramatic climax - ""the kiss"" - which was set up very early in the piece, and to my mind was handled very deftly indeed.Definitely worth a night in.Olly Buxton"
3,I Really Wanted To Like This Movie,"The proof of a movie's appeal is how many time you watch it. This is one movie that I've watched once - just once. The concept was intriguing, but the end result falls short. I really wanted to like it. It turned out to be just okay."
4,MUSIC BETTER THAN THE PLOT-BUT IT'S OK,"This movie is great if you are a 60's folkie, like me. Let me see, THE MAIN STREET SINGERS are THE NEW CHRISTY MINSTRELS. THE FOLKMEN are THE KINGSTON TRIO. And, MITCH AND MICKEY are IAN AND SYLVIA. Did I get it right. I love the song: THERE IS A KISS AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW. Folk and SECOND CITY TV fans will like this one. Especially in DVD form."
3,3 1/2 Stars: Passing Gas,"Christopher Guest's ""A Mighty Wind"" is a mild, humorous comedy based along the same mock-documentary lines of his hilarious ""Dog Show"" and ""Waiting for Guffman."" But whereas his previous movies have been written with a razor sharp wit and biting humor, ""Wind"" is not. Instead, Guest has fashioned a fond look at the 60's Folk Music scene with albeit some very funny bits: such as the whacked out performance of Eugene Levy as Mitch of ""Mitch and Mickey (Catherine O'Hara)"" fame: a singing duo renowned for kissing in the middle of their most famous song.There is no doubt that Guest is a talented comedy writer and director of the quasi-documentary, but he definitely needs to exercise his skills in a straightforward comedy, drama or even action film as it is doubtful that he can top himself in his, thus far chosen genre, especially after the sublime ""Waiting for Guffman."""
2,A Mighty Wind -- blows,"I would give it less than 2, but I did enjoy some of the music, and we laughed a few times. My family didn't enjoy this ""Mockumentary"" very much, and the kids were pretty bored. I really blew it for picking this one out, and I'll probably never hear the end of it from my family. It was just --- weird. And that's probably why we kept watching instead of turning it off. We kept waiting for it to make a little sense, but it never really delivered. When it was over, we just kind of looked at each other in wonder and shrugged. I'm not really sure why it received so many rave reviews. But if you really want to see something ""different"", this is it, because I've certainly never seen anything like it before. Or as my son Jason said, ""Wha' Happened?"""
2,A Mighty Disappointment!,"Standing by itself this movie probably wouldn't have lasted a weekend in theaters before it got yanked. I saw it expecting more of the hilarity from previous movies, but was sadly disapointed. I sat there most of the time with baited breath just waiting for something funny to take off and it just didn't materialize. Don't get me wrong, there were some funny moments, but thats all there was. A Mighty Wind kinda blew!"
2,"The music is great, but ...","The movie drags on and on for too long. The pace is slow and the laughs are few and far in between. I have the soundtrack to this film and I love it. But when I finally got to rent the movie, I was extremely disappointed at how boring it was. Two stars for the last 20 minutes that made the movie worth watching. I recommend buying the soundtrack instead of renting this movie. You will get out of the soundtrack all that you would out of the movie and much more."
2,Not as good as their past movies,"I eagerly awaited this film to come out on DVD since I am a huge Christopher Guest/Eugene Levy fan. Although this movie is still much better than a lot of the stuff out there, I have to give it only 2 stars because it doesn't compare to their past films like ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""Best in Show"". I thought some of the funniest scenes were in the bonus deleted scene footage so I highly recommend you watch this if you buy or rent the DVD. I hope that for their next movie Guest/Levy live up to their potential."
2,Asian music on steel drums and classical guitar?,"I don't know what part of Asia that Asiabeat visited but classical guitar and steel drums aren't what I ususally consider Asian. However, the first track is excellent anyway, but nothing on this album sounds very Asian."
3,wheel of fortune game,bought it for christmas for my granddaughter and she was very happy to get it as a gift and play it alot
1,Right out of the Package the Product was Broken,"We brought this product in late Oct as a Christmas present. Out of the box, it was broken. Sine we brought this item is late Oct, it was not eligible for the extended Christmas returns."
3,wheel,Its ok. After three games it gets boring but if you dont have anything else to do it will pass time for you.
1,anti-Semitic writer?,"Before you purchase this author's books, you might want to check out the discussion on his author forum. He has written on some fascinating topics, but his politics may cause you some concerns."
4,blip<ssssshhh>scritch,"lost gem is a bit of cliche, but I always felt baffled that this album appeared from nowhere, plopped into the meme pool of music almost without a ripple and sank from sight. Amazon don't even have a photo.it's great - quiet, rhymic, engaging - the perfect companion piece to the icy soundscapes of Aphex Twin SAW1, but somehow with a warmer heart. All the sounds are sparse, mechanical and electronic, but there's an analog heart beating under the surface. Succour is alive with hums, tones and whistles, like the fuzz on an AM station, the tracks pop by and the album finishes too soon, again.Obviously not destined to spawn hit singles (though it occasionally threatens to get distinctly funky), but it's a real nugget if you like BOC, Autechre, Aphex, Locust and other electronica poster boys."
1,MIU France stainless steel cheese slicer,The blade came lose first time used it.I fixed it and CAME LOOSE AGAIN! I would not recccomend it to anyone.
1,garbage piece,"please don't buy that slicer. it's just wastage of money. it's better to cut by thick & sharp knife. i brought it to cut sharp cheddar cheese, but looks like it's garbage piece."
1,Do not buy,"I bought this hoping for a better alternative to a wire slicer, since the wires cost just as much as a new slicer. So I bought this. It is a complete waste of money. After the first slice the blade was bent and now it only cuts little tiny pieces of my cheese. If it can't slice a nice slice of cheddar it is not a cheese cutter. We kept trying to use it and just got upset every time. Now I have to go buy another cheese slice. Don't be fooled by the good reviews. Do not buy this product, it is going into my garbage."
3,Good for soft cheese,"Good for soft cheeses, but doesn't cut evenly with harder cheese. Does a very bad job, no matter how much you try to guide it & hold the cheese in place. I will buy another cutter with a wire."
2,Won't work for block cheddar,"I bought this because I was sick of breaking every wire cutter I've ever used. However, I'm still disappointed since I'll have to return this, too. I buy blocks of cheddar from Costco that are like 2x2 inches and need something to slice them easily. The blade on this is too flimsy to stay straight when going through something like that. It bends sideways in the middle and won't make it to the bottom of the block without sliding way off track, making a mess of your block. You'll never get a usable cut from a somewhat hard cheese from this (and from what others say, it's useless for soft cheeses as well). It's probably useful if you are cutting blocks that are small in one dimension, like 1/2 inch by 3 inches."
3,Not worth the price!,"What they did put in the book was alright, however, what they left out made the price seem a little hefty. It almost appears as if they said, ""hey, here's a quick way to make some quick cash, slap this together and the devoted fans will buy it."" Which I'm sure is the case. If you do some quick cross referencing with the encyclopedia, you'll also discover that some of the ""facts"" do not match up. This one is for the collector's, like myself. It does provide some eye candy, but not too much substance."
2,Not an essential Trekkers' book,This book is a disappointment. As a lifetime Trekker I thought it would be wonderful. But there were too few ships and the illustrations were poor.
1,Awful layout ruins what could have been an awesome Trek book,"Unbelievably, Pocket Books has put out a book focusing on the ships of Star Trek. Even more unbelievably, they didn't think, and/or do the research, in presenting the art of these fine ships! Every ship is presented on two pages, that's right, the binder for the book cuts the ships in half.I was sooooo looking forward to this book! But, didn't buy it. You'd figure the folks who put the holes in the calendar so you could hang it sideways would appreciate the obvious, and lengthen the book so the entire art of each ship has it's own single page.Major disappointment! :-(Dan"
4,Thanks,"Thanks for getting the books mailed in good shape. Who knows, maybe there will be a more deals in the future."
3,Could be better,"There are certainly some nice images of ships in this book but there isn't a great deal of variety. For one thing, the ships and images chosen where either due to popularity or because somebody created a pretty picture, or both. There's nothing wrong with those things but most of the vessils featured in this book have been seen hundreds of times already in just as many sources. More under-utilized ships would've been nice as well as odd angles/lighting of known ships that are rarely seen. I also would've preferred at least a few actual images from the shows or movies with the awe-inspiring visuals made in them. Overall, this isn't a bad purchase and is a nice addition to the collection, but it easily could've been better IMO."
1,Disappointing,"To paraphrase an earlier reviewer, great concept, poorly executed. The descriptions and specs are good, but that's about it. The wireframe images are completely useless. 3 sided orthographic views would have served much better here. Also, the full renders are way too dark. What's the point of including beauty shots, if no one can see them? Lastly, the book itself is poorly made. The binding has disintegrated on my first pass through, leaving pages falling out.I cannot recommend this at all. Even though the text was interesting, most (if not all) of the information can be found online for free. Much better qaulity images of the ships can be found online as well. There just really is no reason to spend money on this thing."
2,starships on parade,"The product arrived on time but the content was disapointing. Only a short description of the ship and it's history, and a single image of the ship. The very least we should have a standard 3 point view (left, right, either forward or top with stats and a diagram of the outer features(location of phasers, photon torpedo launchers, warp engines"
4,okay buy,it has cool technical data but the pictures are lame and there a cheazy wire digrams of each vesle that offer nothing
3,Could have been better,"Each ship listed has basic info, specifications, and a wire-frame view on the first two pages. That is followed by a 2 page full cgi rendering in the black of space.The renderings are dimly lit and don't show the ships well, unless you only wanted to see engines glow."
1,"Bad design, but at least it was expensive","My Boston Acoustics Microsystem CD only worked satisfactorily for about 56 weeks, but at least it was expensive. The CD drive stopped functioning about a month after the warranty ran out. Boston Acoustics refused to do anything about it. I subsequently got a bit of use out of the unit as a radio until the volume suddenly froze at 00 and it has never budged off 00 again. Boston Acoustics corporate ""support"" office's response has been ""so sad, too bad"" when I contacted them about each of these problems. Worst of all, I bought it from Boston Acoustics' online refurbished store - obviously they took it back from some hapless buyer and then turned around and sold it again without fixing it. Seems like a very irresponsible company."
5,Boston Acoustics,The Boston Acoustics radio is absolutely the best sounding system we have ever owned. Prior to purchasing this system we had a BOSE system. The Boston sound is so clear and crisp that you think the musicians are playing their music in your home. I would recommend this system over the Bose system!
1,Dented!,The radio looks good but I don't know how it sounds yet. J&R sent me one with a nice large dent in the speaker mesh. Hmmmmm.... $399.99 with a dent? Glad I used my Amex. Also they want me to pay for return shipping?!?! Not my idea of good customer service. What is Bose's phone number?
4,on point,"This is a really good album to have come out in 05. The message is going hard and the beats Are slamming. Gospel rap should have you amped for righteous and a hatred for sin, and this album is that. the only negative, is that on a couple of songs, it's hard to understand the a artist."
3,A Ho-Hum read,"Donna has gotten herself in trouble again. After a night of over indulgence - a pitcher of margaritas will do that to a girl - she finds herself in a strange man's room. Well not just any strange man's, he is her father's first sergent! And guess what? Daddy and all the Marines staying at the hotel for the Batallion Ball find out before Donna can even make her less than graceful exit in the morning thanks to a few gossips. To avoid disgracing her father again, Donna decides to go along with first sergent Jack Harris'idea of a marriage of convenience. But will this plan work? This book is third in a series of three."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!,"I read lots of books, and I have to say that this was one of the best I've read! This book isn't about the same old things like falling in love then getting married! Instead the heroin of the book first meets the guy, marries him, gets pregnant, then falls in love! Not an ordinary day by day occurance, but the book was so good that I HAD to read it in one day!!! I just could bear to put it down!"
2,Is Ms. Child slightly obsessed?,"Cowboys, outlaws, bank robbers, jarheads, shotgun weddings shotgun weddings shotgun weddings. Are we seeing a pattern yet?"
4,Good Product,"This book works out just fine for my class. It was a good price and it came fast. There was a lot of writing in it, but that was okay, because I just needed it for class. As far as the book, it's a great practice of grammar!"
3,Small!,"They don't lie about the size, but seeing is believing. This charm is SMALL. Don't think it compares to Flavor Flav's clock! I bought it for my sister and I'mma really have to impress how valuable it is because the size may lead viewers to think something different. Having said that, if you know Black women who love them some Nefertiti, then this would be a great gift for them. If you or they feel that ""less is more,"" then you will be pleased. I actually may keep buying copies and giving it as presents to dah sistahs."
3,Not as good as Patrick O'Brian,"The Kent novels are good, but the 21 Patrick O'Brian novels (Master and Commander, Post Captain, H.M.S. Surprise, etc.) are richer in both characters and feel for life aboard in the Royal Navy (and ashore). In both cases, I also STRONGLY recommend getting ""A Sea of Words"" by Dean King because he explains all the nautical terms (""fid"", ""catting the anchor"", ""drowned baby"" etc.)"
4,Excellent Value,"Very clean. I am using this primarily for vocals with a Shure SM7B. The tube is of questionable value, but at this price, I can't complain.Update: After awhile I started to notice that this could be more transparent and replaced it with a Grace 101. Still this is totally acceptable for line in instruments. And if you can't afford the Grace..."
3,It's alright.,"It's a little difficult to use, and is usually to high, but when you get right, the lights don't light up to detect your voice."
2,Not as good as Inside the Taj Mahal ( the first one),"The first part of this cd is up to the standards of the original Inside but if you are into meditation and relaxation this cd goes into a lot of sound effects that are quite disturbing, like thunder and bells and and a lot of so called nature sounds."
1,Good in principle but...,"Saw a similar if not identical video on a recent airline flight and it was very impressive. Based on the after-viewing credits scrolling by on the screen, I searched on the web and tracked down this item. The price was great.Unfortunately, the product has not worked on any of the 5 DVD players we've tried it on. Guessing it is a format incompatibility with a US standard. Not sure why this should be the case as our electronics are of fairly recent vintage. We cannot recommend a purchase under these conditions."
2,Misleading title and disappointing videography,"Many other places in the world I have seen in real life or in standard definition videos looked much better than what are captured with the high resolution footages on this blue-ray DVD. Sure the image quality is good simply because it is recorded in high definition. There are a few nice scenes but overall the contents are poor, nowhere near the quality and depth of any National Geographic video."
2,Stop the music!,This could have been a great video if there were an option to cut off the music. While the sound effects were canned as well at least that was more mood setting. The music is not bad but you just do not want to listen to it that long. This is a good sample video of what you could buy - but each element is long enough around 10 mins per landscape set. When I bought this I did not think it was a sampler.
2,20 minutes per disc,"I initally purchased the sampler, with all 9 scenes played for a few minutes. Then I proceed to purchase this set of 9 disc. Alas, whether you like the content is a personal matter, but each disc is only 20 minutes long !!! no where in the description indicate such short play-time, I kept popping disc in & out all the time. I am quite sure a disc can have bigger memory capacity than that."
4,Good For The Money,"I think the video quality is VG-Excellent overall. Yes the music is great on some, not so great on others. My wife said the same as another person - where is the narration? If you want that there are many other discs. I find it refreshing not to have someone talking for a change. This disc is not meant to be educational or instructive!! When you go out to a great scenic place do you want constant chatter?Based on this disc I bought the 9 disc version. I'll post under that title but, in a nutshell, its not worth paying for the longer segments as some of the locations i.e. Hawaii & Pacific Coast are not all that wonderful (I've been there) or certainly not the best those locations can offer. Also on some locations, the same boring scenes are too long, like someone pulled of the road, set up the camera, took a nap, woke up & moved on. Not much effort into finding the best places. I'm returning that 9 disc set. THIS set IS worth the money."
4,Good Hi-Def scenery/landscape disc,"Does what it says on the box. This Blu-ray disc gives you 75 minutes worth of Hi-Def scenery and landscapes, along with some OK but not amazing, yet pleasant piano style music to accompany it. This is not a documentary, it's more of a demo disc to show some nice places in High Definition."
3,"Pretty, please ...","The images are beautiful, but move quickly from one shot to the next. My benchmark is the Discovery Channel's ""Sunrise"" series.The only real disappointment was the 'Wyndham Hill' soundtrack. the natural ambient sound would have been so much better."
2,Definately not worth the money!,I love watching HD anything; but for the price this was uninteresting and alot of the video was not that great of quality. This might be okay in a Doctor's waiting room or something but not to simply view at home. There were SOME good shots but none worth the price of this. I would DEFINATELY buy Planet Earth instead. I regret my purchase.
1,Living Landscapes: The World's Most Beautiful Places [HD DVD],Receieved my DVD and it does not work. Tried on 3 DVD players and will not open or play. Not happy
1,Plays Only on HD DVD Players,"And of course it doesn't say that on the packaging, but it does on the actual DVD. It wouldn't play on my DVD/Blu-Ray player nor would it play on my computer, which has a DVD player. I might have gotten a dud, but the fact that it only works on HD DVD players could be why it is such a deal. So if you have a HD DVD, I'm sure this is a good bang for the buck. But if you don't have one of those, don't waste your money because it won't work."
2,Ummmm Okay,"Not sure how I got this one. I wouldn't have paid for it, butit does make for a nice screen saver. . ."
1,Living Landscapes are garbage,This entire line of discs looks and sounds horrible. These are captured on a consumer camera and burned on a computer. I warned you.
1,doesn't play,"Forget Ordering this unless you have an older HD-DVD player. I have a Sony Blue-Ray that has never not played any DVD that I placed in it, save this one. Save yourself the hassle of having to return this and don't bother ordering unless you are absolutely sure that have the right player. Unfortunately I can't comment on the contents."
1,Don not order,"DVD didn't work. Message said ""bad disc"". Do not order this disc. It was a big disappointment. And now I have the hassle of returning it!"
2,Unimpressive,"I bought Natures Colors along with this Blu-ray. After watching that one before this one, it was apparent they used quite a bit of the same footage. In fact I recognized almost ALL of it from the other video, really very dissapointing. Add that to the burned in website you have to look at for much of the video, plus the horrible elevator music, plus it is 1080i not 1080p - I give this a hands-down. Natures Colors was also only 1080i but at least that one had good music."
1,burned in logo,"Some of the video has a burned in logo for their website, in white text. Do not buy this if you're concerned about screen burn-in."
4,"Great video, not so great audio","Good news: This is one of the few good landscape DVDs that don't require you to have a HD or BluRay player. The landscapes truly are beautiful and are REAL, unlike some of the DVDs I've purchased in the past that only had animated nature scenes, even though they proudly proclaimed on the packaging ""Shot in HD!"" (I'm looking at you, 'Living Art' DVDs!).Bad news: You can't turn off the music on this collection and just listen to the natural sounds. You can hear them (barely) in the background, but the music track drowns it out. Just be aware of that if you wanted to hear the sounds of the ocean, or the birds of the forest."
1,Enjoyment Ruined By Piano Soundtrack,"The DVD sleeve describes this collection as ""designed to create sensory-immersive experiences of the worlds most beautiful environments"" For me the enjoyment was ruined by the piano sountrack which drowns out the natural outdoor sounds. It's like watching Sunrise Earth with an annoying new age piano soundtrack. There is no way to kill the piano sountrack other than muting all of the sound."
1,"Onscreen ID ""bug"" sucks -- big time!","The inclusion of an ID ""bug"" for the entirety of every other segment mars what would be a very nice disc. What idiot thought it would be OK to use such a thing on videos of ""Most Beautiful Places?""For this reason I cannot recommend the purchase of this disc. They should be giving it away if they insist on using it for advertising."
1,Whoops Again,Blue Ray Player - Would not PlayDVD Players - 2 - Would not play on eitherComputer DVD - Would not playComputer HD-DVD - PlayedSays for Home Theatre - Looks like a rip reburn to work on an HD-TV...
5,Easy Listening Bluegrass,This is an easy to listen to CD of Bluegrass music. It is a mix of old and newer artists.
5,On the point,"This is the full dance version of the ballet.Because I had only heard snippets and compilations of Nutcracker before laying out for this CD package I was really impressed upon first hearing by the grand scope of the ballet.How he then managed to wrap up the whole thing in so concise a package with such complete exploration of each single piece is completely beyond me.I need many other hearings of this work and another orchestra to hear before I can figure out how this one has interpreted the ballet. But if you are like me and have not listened to entire works as the composers have penned them, go for it."
