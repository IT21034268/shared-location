4,It's as enthralling as the other four,"The other reviewers seem to be disappointed that Karon has moved the Kavanaghs from Mitford, but not me. I thoroughly enjoyed the new set of townspeople and new challenges for Fr. Tim. The only problem I had was that there was some confusion at the end (why did he need to circle Morris's house so many times? Never explained.) I felt the confrontation of Helene Pringle was too quickly and too easily disposed of. Why would Tim and Cynthia return for her when they wouldn't go back when Dooley was arrested (Bishop or no?) The cryptic ending was out of character for Karon's style, and too cute of a segue into the next book. Nevertheless, Ms. Karon, I'll buy your next Mitford series book the instant it's published. Your musings are real ""comfort food "" for the brain!"
3,A disappointed Mitford-series fan,"I was so looking forward to catching up with Father Tim and his dear wife Cynthia; but I was sorely disappointed with this book. Maybe it was my frame of mind when I read A New Song...I don't know. I never really got to know the inhabitants of Whitecap and frequently found myself flipping back to see who was who. AND there was at least one glaring editing error (calling Eva Mona in the chapter where Junior is anxiously meeting Eva)! There were holes in the storyline...didn't anyone else want to see Dooley at Christmas and see how Whitecappers celebrated? The climax was uncharacteristically shallow and I saw it coming for miles and miles. I would have liked to witness the scene that took place between Morris and Father Tim... Overall, this was a very disappointing book. While I anxiously await the new installment (that MUST be on the way, given the mysterious ending), I do hope that the author will take a little more time developing story and character alike."
5,"A New Song (The Mitfored Years, #5)","The entire Mitford series experience can be compared to receiving a warm, loving embrace from your most treasured friend! The pages welcome you into an interesting, pleasant world, where solid Christian values are forefront and modern-day filth and profanity are refreshingly absent! The reader will come to love and care about Father Tim, Dooley, all the towns' people - even busybody Emma! Each book in the series welcomes you into the world of Mitford and invites you to stay as long as you can, with hospitality true to it's southern roots! I wish I lived in Mitford!"
5,"As always, this Mitford book is fabulous, too!","I went to my favorite book resource, and bought this one, the day of publication! I was hardly able to wait, until this one was published. I hope Ms. Karon publishes the next two in this series much faster. Even though the book was in a different setting this time, the new dilemmas, and their resolutions, were still just as heartwarming and believable, as all of the other books. I really enjoyed the storm scene with Father Tim, and could feel his anxiety, and the worry that Cynthia must have felt for him. I'm ready for the next one!"
5,Makes me smile,"Jan's books always make me smile. They are written with such heartfelt vigor. Father Tim is so real to me that it's as if I know him. I like to contrast books. Another series that is so very true and amusing (and much more likely to bring a tear to your eye) is Homer Hickam's series of Coalwood books - October Sky, The Coalwood Way, and Sky of Stone. Mitford fans would love Coalwood."
1,A poor book by poor scholars...,"This book is an example of how not to write a fair evaluation of two great thinkers. The authors worship Lewis as if he were the apologist who could think no wrong, while they condemn Schaeffer as an ignorant fundamentalist who was just about always wrong in some shape or form. I enjoy reading the works of both Lewis and Schaeffer. I have never found their views to be mutually exclusive as Burson and Walls lead their readers to believe.If I could summarize this book in one word it would be ""biased."" Burson and Walls have obvious Armenian tendencies, which might have led them to cling so firmly to Lewis' backside."
4,The Most Demented Album I Own,"I haven't heard Macabre's second release ""Dahmer"" yet, but could it possibly any sicker than this? This is just some sick and twisted metal. I mean what other band has a song called ""The Ted Bundy Song""? Just look at the album cover. I also love how short and to the point each song is. No overly long or complicated songs, just a massacre of double bass drum, thrashing guitars and violent low and high screaming. There can't be any songs on here that are over 2 minutes long. Some don't even reach a minute. This is why they were able to fit 25 songs on this album, clocking in just under one hour. The best song on the album and probably my favorite murder/death metal song of all time is ""Vampire of Düssledorf."" That song just freakin rules. If you are into death metal/thrash in general and like sick demented music relating to serial killers mainly, Macabre is for you."
5,Hilarious Death Metal,"The vocal notes these guys hit are incredible.A very unique band right here, who takes their lyrics directly from newspaper articles and letters of the murderers, rapists and other sickos of whom they describe in their songs."
4,the guy below sucks,"take my word for it, read his other reviews.this cd, while not being macabre's best effort, is funny as hell and totally rockin'!it's a shame that a lot of folks can't appreciate music with integrity."
5,"If you like speed metal, than you must buy this!",This is one of my favorite cd's ever. I can't seem to stop listening to it. Funny and intense songs about serial killers. They never seem to slow down! And possibly the fastest drummer in the world. I have seen these guys live and they just rock.
1,Hard up for Death Metal? Buy this!,"This music sucks, don't take my word for it; listen to the clips on Amazon. Then if you want some good stuff, check out Cathedral "" Ethereal Mirror"" or ""Carnival Bizarre"""
1,This music is awful,"first of all they are making money off killers... think of the families, don't buy into this!It's no wonder Macabre has been playing out of a garage for 16 years...what comes around goes around.The lyrics are spin offs off the journalists news paperstories, not very authentic,Raw?? I don't think these guys have seen a fleck of horror! Now if Gacy was the singer writing abuothimself...and his pre-thoughts that would be Raw! Macabe stinks!"
2,THIS IS NOT ALL OF HITCHCOCK'S MOVIE MUSIC,"I have to agree with the other reviewer, that this cd was not the best. The songs were too slow (especially Psycho and Rear Window) and really sounded fake. There is also not just Hitchcock music on here, but there is music from other movies that Lalo Schifrin did. It was a very poorly put together cd.The only reason I kept this cd is because it contains MOST of the instrumental score from Rear Window, which you cannot find anywhere else. If you want to hear the Hitchcock music the way it sounds in the movies, I recommend ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Signatures in Suspense"".The bottom line is unless you want the score to Rear Window- stay AWAY from this cd!"
4,Enjoyable album with a few rare gems,"Even if technically this album isn't up to scratch, it can't be said that Schifrin and the San Diego Pops entirely miss the spirit of the old Hitchcock scores. This is an entertaining romp through themes from Waxman, Herrmann, and a few of Lalo Schifrin's own tunes.I believe this is the only available recording of Franz Waxman's music from Rear Window, which was really what made me buy this CD. Waxman's score is jazz-oriented, some of which is a reworking of themes from A Place in the Sun. (The rest of the film featured an eclectic mix of his own work and others', including a few snatches of Leonard Bernstein, though everything here is the composer's own.) Again, the technical quality is patchy--there are even a few wrong notes in there--but Lalo has captured the liveliness and playfulness of Waxman's original."
5,Amalgama soberbia de música moderna,"Se fusiona la música de aquí y de allá, la de ahora y la de siempre. ECM edita un disco soberbio, en el que el tunecino Brahem, desliza con elegancia y modernidad el sonido de sus cuerdas sobre una elegante y sobria textura pianística romántica salpicada de la fuerza de un acordeón que nos explica la importancia de Piazolla en la música moderna. Una amalgama mediterranea de música ECM con tintes étnicos y clacisismo europeo diferente a lo escuchado hasta ahora. Bravo Manfred Eicher!!!"
4,"Beautiful, But...","This album is very touching and charming in general. The melodies are airy and beautiful, the interplay between the players is great and the work as a whole is masterful. The recording technique is also great as usual.As the Amazon editorial review above sais, so many influences have shaped this album to the extent that Brahem has almost lost the originality he retained in his earlier works.. Sometimes it seems like a cocktail of numerous musical genres and influences, which one doesn't necessarily regard as a ""merit"". I don't quite understand what Mr. Brahem means by this..Another feature is that Brahem here seems more distant from his native Arabic tradition than in any of his earlier albums.Anyway, I can confidentally say that Anouar Brahem is not as distinguished ín any of both traditions he composes within (Arabic versus Western) as in combining them.. However, I would still recommend this for listeners who like Brahem's other albums."
5,truly unique,It is hard to describe this unusual CD. Hauntingly peaceful are two words that come to mind.Relaxing and calming are two more. Simply beautiful also.
1,A Plodding Oater,"I once heard someone describe a dull western movie as a ""plodding oater."" OK, so this is not a western adventure, but the description fits.Every now and then, I run across a children's book that challenges my sanity. This one qualifies. Perhaps some children have the tenacity to finish books that repeat, and repeat, and repeat words, phrases, and ideas over and over. Perhaps all of this repetition reinforces reading skills. Well, I could not finish the book and my daughter was bored to sleep before we could get past the halfway point."
3,A very heavy and awkward drill,"I really liked this drill,until I used the a DeWalt. I am a union carpenter from Toledo.I use the drill in many diffrent tasks from door hardware to drilling for Tapcons.Itis a rugged tool,but it is not balanced at all.It is also very long and heavy.The hammer mode is very very slow.I have used the DeWalt 14.4 also and think that it is a better design.The only decent tool from Milaukee is the 1/2"" magnum corded drill in my opinion."
2,Nothing but problems with this tool.,"I returned mine after a few weeks use. The main problem was that the batteries often ""stuck"" and couldn't be removed. Also, the drill is very heavy, which I guess could be expected from an 18 volt tool. I also own one of the recently discontinued DeWalt 14.4 volt drills, which I prefer to the Milwaukee."
4,Soft smelling.,"I put it on my sons clothing before I put them on him. It does not have a very powerful smell, which is good for my baby."
3,Burberry baby perfume,I work with children and the smell of this perfume on a child was my favorite. Once the dad told me the name of this perfume I went and bought it for my newborn boy. good smell...soft and pleasant.
4,OCD workbook works only if you want to make it work,"Bought it to use with my special ed student who has a couple of mental health issues including OCD. THe workbook was not helpful because he was not at the point where ""he really wanted"" to overcome or at least reduce his obsessive behaviors. For anyone determined to take control of the problem and help themselves it, I believe, would be helpful."
5,The one I think about the most....,This is an awesome book for client and clinician. Great simplified (not dumbed down) explanations and hand outs. Great resource for group work.
2,Not for me,"I purchased this from Amazon based on Amazon's recommendation because of a few other books I had bought. I had just finished reading ""Brain Lock"" by Jeffrey M. Schwartz. I found that they were similar, but I already had so many tools that I learned in the other book that I found this one to be too detailed and rigorous. In my case, I would just recommend reading ""Brain Lock"" and skipping this one."
4,Extremely helpful,The OCD workbook is a practical book that could be of immeasurable value to anyone suffering from OCD or to professionals who need to work with OCD clients. It has been written in such a way that it can be useful in terms of the clear description of the nature of OCD and of the different ways in which it manifests in people's lives. This makes it usable for OCD patients in helping them to understand what they are dealing with and to remove the guilt and self-blame that often is part of such patients. With the help of a therapist and this workbook they can effectively deal with OCD. As a therapist I found it most helpful in being able to explain the disorder clearly and to assist the client in working with obsessions and compulsions. This book can be recommended to a wide audience of those wanting to know more about OCD and to those desperate to change their own lives and those of others.
5,"Sensible, helpful, and encouraging...","I've purchased two copies of this book for family members with OCD, and it has helped immensely. It gave me a much clearer understanding of the mind of the OCD sufferer, and helped my loved ones actively participate in their recovery. Highly recommended."
4,The Bird Can Fly!,"This collection comes from Parker's Savoy and Dial recordings. Unlike the After Midnight compilation (Verve - also reviewed by me), these two CD's feature ONLY small groups (with sidemen like Miles Davis, Dizzie Gillespie,. . .). The songs are mostly very up-tempo, and the solos are barn burners. These songs include all the instrumental standards most commonly associated with Parker, like Ornithology, Scrapple from the Apple, and KoKo, so this is a great way to get them all in one place for a very reasonable price. The production quality varies between fairly good and mediocre - it can be difficult to hear piano and bass, particularly on the radio performances. That quibble aside, this collection is a very affordable way to buy a jam-packed survey of Parker's post-orchestral work."
1,too hard!,"Some games have to be hard to be fun, but this game is too hard, which takes away the fun. There isn't much of a plot, and leo, mike, raf, and don look exactly the same, just with different weopons. This is a bad game with great character's, odn't get it just for it's title. Don't get this game unless u like old classic's with horrible graphics, no plots, and a game that is TOO HARD. If u are loooking for good ninja turtle game's, please buy tmnt 2 and tmnt 3 Manhattan project, u will be like them."
2,Side scrolling tough action game,"It is a side scrolling game where you play as all 4 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and pause the game to select a different turtle. Donatello has the longest ranged, slowest and most powerful. Rapheal has the quickest, shortest and least damaging. Michaelangelo and Leonardo are somewhere in between. This game is more difficult than fun. Difficult as opposed to challenging. Most everything can kill you quickly. There are top down areas (which seem almost pointless) where you wander from sewer to sewer where the real side scrolling action is. Foot soldiers and various other enemies that don't quite make sense for a turtles game.This is a game that requires some prescision and the turtles control pretty poorly. There is quite a bounce back when you get hit. Jumps are tough to control. Not a good game at all. It is just a missed oppertunity for what could have been a great debut for the turtles on the NES.The next two turtle games for the NES were much better."
1,too hard!,"Some games have to be hard to be fun, but this game is too hard, which takes away the fun. There isn't much of a plot. Leo, Mike, Raf, and Don look exactly the same, just with different weopons. This is a bad game with great character's, don't get it just because u like ninja turtles, that is why i got it, and i rarely play it. Don't get this game unless u like the accomplishment of beating an extremely hrad game, or if u like old classic's with horrible graphics, no plots, and a game that is TOO HARD. If u are loooking for good ninja turtle game's, please buy tmnt 2 and tmnt 3 Manhattan project, u will be like them."
3,"Joyce Cooling, Revolving Door",I think the cd is not that great. It does not exemplify the total smooth jazz I am used to from Joyce Cooling. I rushed out to get the new release but was disappointed when I listen to it.
3,Not good enough,"There are in my opinion, only two really good tracks on the whole CD. I would not recommend the CD."
2,Not a fan,"I've been slugging it out with this book for a couple weeks and I have to face it: while I love Monica Furlong's fiction books, I cannot stand her non-fiction (at least in this case). She makes me not care about any of the people she's reporting on, and it's just dry stuff that I can't put into meaningful context for myself in the 21st century."
5,This is a MUST read!,"I never knew how much I didn't know about teens these days, until I read this book. I have two teens, and they knew a LOT more than I did about things in this book. I know my children's friends, where they are, and what they are doing. What I didn't know was what some of their friends were doing. The book was helpful in reiterating what I was already doing: talking to my teens. Communication is so important. The book really emphasizes that. It also gave me insight into that fact that although my teens may not show it, they are listening to what I tell them, and that talking about sex, drugs, alcohol and consequences isn't just a one-time conversation; it's ongoing.I have already used some of the suggestions in the book with great results."
4,Krazy 2 Christ,"I alwayz luv'd 3xKrazy muzik, so it was kinda hard 4 me to understand whut happen 2 them since i am not from Kali, but they have alwayz represented Kali 2 itz finest & i was a little upset to see agerman switch over to gospel rap, but i have 2 try 2 understand whut he has been threw, life & da game. I found this album to a very nice album, lyrics & beat wise.Very smooth it is so to u Agerman the Lord has shined on u & I stand az one of ur true fanz.......keep up the good work but neva forget where u came from....3xKrazy Lifer...Mallalationn from tha C.O."
4,REPRESENTS A PART OF AMERICAN HISTORY,IT SPEAKS TO ME AT A GLANCEI LOVE THE LAYOUTANYTHING THAT SPEAKS OF AMERICAN HISTORYALL LOYAN AMERICANS
3,"would have been 5 stars, except for 17 missing pages","Great book. Foreword by Robert K. Brown, Lt. Col. USAR (RETIRED). Best known to the public for publishing ""Soldier of Fortune"" magazine. The author, Bob Newman, is a former Marine. This book shoots straight. I would have given it 5 stars, but my copy had 17 blank pages. My only option was to return it for a refund. Too much of a pain in the ass. So I'm keeping this one, and I'll be looking for another copy.(which I will check for blank/missing pages.) The info is GREAT. If your new to this kind of warfare, this book is a great place to start. BUY IT. (but check the pages) :>)REPUBLIC!?!"
3,Worthwhile reading...,"This is a good book on guerrilla warfare; however as someone who has read extensively on the subject... Giap, Guevara, Levy, Dach, Mao, Bayo etc. I feel in retrospect that this is the worst of the bunch, I feel it didn't really add anything new on the subject and a lot of the book is pure filler, for example excessively large pictures which are hardly necessary... on page 146 there is a near full page photo of a guy sitting on the back of a truck smiling giving a thumbs up: underneath the caption states... ""Alcohol can often be used to loosen a prisoner's tongue faster than any other approach. This Spanish Legionnaire knows the deal.""However it does contain a good amount of practical information so I still recommend reading it. However if you're not willing to read every book on the subject I would recommend ""Special Forces Guerrilla Warfare Manual"" instead."
3,Pocket guide to guerrilla warfare.,"Brown's book is an excellent GUIDE for individuals who are trying to understand the basics of guerrilla warfare or are in the buisness of training or advising guerrilla/counter-guerrilla units. To fully appreciate or understand this book one has to of already had some experience in this area, overall it contains excellent information for, ""academic study only"", and leaves the reader with want to research more about the specific cases the author uses for examples. To the YOUNG MAN who wrote the bad review, my suggestion to you if your looking for a book to teach you how to be a guerilla fighter is-buy a plane ticket to the Congo, Chechnya, or Afghanistan and learn the only real way instead of trying to find it in a book."
3,You must choose the best book but not this book.,I have read this book.I don't like many titles and it is wrong that it is For Academic Study Only.
2,"Rich with Features, but...","- FEATURES - I like it! From the beginning, gave me a screen on what I would like to make and had a simple template for everything. Movie sizes were smaller and liked how I can preview movies in another tab.- COMPATIBILITY (HEADACHE)- If you want to use their latest components or library, be prepared for users to install Flash Player 7.0+. This part is giving me a headache since my users are very novice with these things.- UNSTABLE - This has to be the biggest flaw of this software. Now I'm use to saving after every change because of how unstable it is. I get the annoying ""Windows cannot recover Flash MX 2004"" and it crashes out.- OVERALL - NICE, if it worked the way it's suppose to be. I would NOT recommend it to other buyers. Develope in Flash MX until Flash Player 7.0 has gone around the world. Remember to save frequently. I wish I can get my money back =(."
3,What no normal mode for actionscript,I'm familiar with the previous versions of flash. I find the no normal mode for actionscript to be a major headache. I use flash primarily for animation. I'm not too keen on the programming aspects. I'll leave that to the computer geeks.
3,Flash MX 2004,"I'm just a kid but when I discovered this at school, I used all my free time just playing with the animation, motion and shape tweening, actions, motion clips, sound, everything. This product is good but some of the tools are to basic. It's so hard to get an Alpha on a object. Even when I motion tween it, it still won't let me!Overall it's pretty good. I'm still learning though."
2,Not that great,"The NES version is not that great. The Genesis version is better, but the arcade version bundled with Strider 2 for the Playstation is the best.Really, the NES version is Strider in name only. There is little of the fun or excitement from the arcade, and the graphics are weak. NES Strider is kind of a globe-trotting adventure game, much less fun or innovative than Ducktails for the NES or Tomb Raider.If you are familiar with Strider from the arcade game or Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, skip the NES version and get the two-disk PS1 version of Strider 2 or the Genesis version."
3,Review of Cat Door and Transmitter,"The cat door itself has worked well and, most importantly, has relieved my wife and I of being woken up at 3 am to open the door to let our cat out and having the corner of our bed being scratched at 3 a.m. to wake us up to let the cat out. For the Door itself, I'd give a 5.The negative with the product is that our cat has such long hair that it blocks the transmitter on his collar from reaching the door to allow it to open, so we have taped the door to allow it to always be able to be opened by both of our cats, as we have since been adopted by another one.So far we have not had any problem with other critters coming through the door which was our concern and why we ordered a door with the electronic collar transmitter.Because we overpaid for a product that only works partially in our case, but didn't want to go through ripping it out of the wall that was built as part of a large remodel, we are only partially satisfied with the overall product."
1,Terrible Product!!!,"I purchased this product hoping that it would work for my cat. However, my cat is not only large but long haired as well. The dinky magnet they supplied for this product doesn't work; it got all tangled up in his fur. I called Cat Mate directly to get some assistance and the first guy I talked to was very friendly and suggested a couple of things, which didn't work. He told me to call him back but when I did, the woman I spoke with refused to connect me to him and then was very arrogant and rude. She refused to help with the magnet problem and stated that I could ""purchase"" a dog magnet for my cat! Really? I paid over $60 for this thing and that's the customer service I get? I do not recommend this product to anyone nor would I recommend contacting them."
3,Doesn't keep Raccoons out.,This door has been great until the Raccoons figured out how to open it from the outside. Not sure how they do it because we've pushed from the outside to the point where we thought any harder would crack the door. They still get in.
4,Cat Mate Large Cat Door - change the screws though,"Good product but be aware, the screws they give you are very bad. I would strongly recommend you use your own screws that are better quality as these ones butter (loose all definition for the screwdriver) and you can't back them out to reposition the door. I think the Chinese factory was making shortcuts on quality for that."
5,Nice Bully Bar!,"Bully bar looked very nice when I took out from package and looked even better on my wife's 4Runner. Easy to install, took me about 15 mins. easier to do with a 2nd person holding the bar while you bolt the bar on. Bought it for wife's birthday and she loves the look of the bar on her suv, black bar on white 4Runner with black running boards."
5,just what I need,"With what I've been hearing about theft of these GPS', Not having the mount sucked to the windsheild To show I have a GPS in the vehicle, this purchase was definately a plus. I had the old suction cup let go and my GPS was dangling out the drivers side door. Other stores had this for around 40 dollars but it was a good suprize coming here to find it so much cheaper.Cheers!"
4,Good for travel,This is handy to move from car to car especially when traveling. The only problem is that the adapter sometimes loses connection and it has to be wiggled to reconnect.
4,Good product,This product is a huge improvement from the window suction mount that came with my Garmin c340. There is no mounting necessary and it sits on the dash where you place it. It moves a little from road vibration but that is not really a problem. One of the hidden benefits is that you can place the entire unit on the floor to discourage theft of your GPS. I recommend it highly.
4,Garman Dashboard Mount,I have used this in my car for about 1 year. Great. Does not slide (stays put). Wish Garman provided this rather than the glass mount - If you travel and use your GPS - you'll want this one. I bought this one for my wife to use in her car.
5,Garmin StretPilot C340,"I can't believe what this little unit can do.......It is awesome!!!!! You simply put in the address or request ""Food"", ""Lodging"", etc. and there you go. It takes you to the door. My wife also loves it and she's not keen on technology. I would highly recommend it to all who travel."
5,best support !,"this dashboard is so easy to use, way more convenient and clean (no need to wet the windshield one so it sticks) than the windshield support.If I had to get a new gps, I would by this dashboard at the same time !"
3,Works well enough,"Product works, but tends to slide around on the dash after a while. Still, it's better than the windshield mount."
4,Good product,Bought this as a gift. My brother loves it and raves about it. This is very versatile and the reasonable cost is also good.I would recommend it to anyone who wants to spend the extra to get a very stable and convenient mount for their GPS.
5,Best StreetPilot mount available,Toss out that suction cup mount. I had two of them. They fall then your charge link breaks. This mount cant be beat. Love it. Slip it on the dash. Anything that would cause it to move would dislodge the suction cup for sure. Just wish this came standard with the Garmin units.
4,Garmin dashboard mount for streetpilot,its a 4 stars item. work very well on the dashboard of any vehicle
5,Works really well,"I have a dashboard that curves many ways, and was skeptical that this item would work, but it is fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Good product with a bad fixed cradle,"I still haven't tried this in my car. But as I opened the packet, I found that the cradle and the charger are attached together premanently. I didnot like the charger always attached to the cradle since I have C340 which holds charge for upto 8 hrs. I think it is a inconvience and not great looking when the charger is always attached.After I tried it in my car, I did like the product. It is very stable."
1,gramin dash mount,"I bought this to mount on a 2002 Toyota Avalon and the angle of the windshield will not allow it to sit there and the one that sticks to the windshield is always falling off. It fell off during the night and hit the ""flasher"" button causing the battery to run down during the night."
3,A bit disappointed.,"The unit works as adertised and was easy to set up. Unfortunatley it fell short on a couple of areas. It placed the C340 in a position where the glare made it difficult to read or the angle of the head comprimised a clear view of the unit. Also, there is a great deal of gitter. I'll save this for occasions when the suction mount just won't work."
3,Needs a Helping Hand,"The dashboard mount offers two critical advantages. It is easily portable, and it provides a convenient viewing angle for the navigator. On rough terrain, however, it can slide a bit, requiring some vigilance on the part of the driver. One small square of Velcro solves the problem."
4,"Works well, not perfect but well","I use this in an emergency vehicle, so I have put it to the test and then some. It mostly stays in a general area. It does move slightly on bumpy roads and with excessive turns. By slightly I mean 1 inch in any direction.I haven't gotten it to fall off the dash or flip over (though I have tried).It holds it's own in a high G turn, tipping slightly. In normal use it pretty much stays put. I would highly recommend it for normal driving, and recommend in general for emergency vehicle use."
2,DOESN'T DO THE JOB,"I bought this because my GPS kept falling off the windshield with the original mount. However, this dashboard mount (which is like a beanbag) didn't work any better. I finally fixed it by buying double-sticky tape that has a layer of foam between the pieces of tape. I cut pieces the size of the feet of this dashboard mount and effectively taped it to the dashboard. Not very attractive but finally the GPS stays where it belongs."
2,Useless Mount,"Having read several glowing reviews prior to my purchase, I was very disappointed to find that everytime I stepped on the accelerator, my GPS would slide to a new location on the dashboard (2005 Maxima). I do not make jack rabbit starts. I drive like the average driver. Yet I could not keep the GPS from moving. If I made a concerted effort to make very gentle starts, the unit would not move; this was great for attending funerals, but for normal driving this mount is useless.Bottom line: This was a waste of $32.00."
5,Excellent product. No more GPS falling off windshield.,"After trying various ways to mount my Garmin C320 in my car including supplied suction cup, this garmin dash mount has worked best in both my cars. It stays at one place at various speed.(No more falling off the windshield like suction cup in extreme heat)Good investment that protects GPS unit."
2,slips around too much,I've had this mount for a few months now and it keeps slipping off my dashboard. I drive a 2002 Honda Accord and when I accelerate or turn it always slips off. It has fallen off my dashboard numerous times. I'm highly disappointed despite what everyone has said about this item.
3,Needs updating,"the dash mount is generally good but sometimes fallif you are making a rough turn..but as other reviewers mentioned, it is better thanthe suction-cup mount, but I have not at all tried it."
4,Recent Trip,"The unit was very helpful locally around the country, HOWEVER, we found limited difficulties with the unit when we chose a ""different route"" from that proposed by the Garmin. Then it was a noisy intrusion. I will learn more about programming the unit before using it again. If it still isn't able to recognize a ""better route,"" I'll return it."
5,Sits pretty,"In brief, this is a great product and should probably be offered with the c340 in the first place. I'll be darned if I'm going to put a suction cup on my window, knowing the sun or a bumpy back road will put it and my GPS in my lap. And who the heck wants to yank it off the window when parking publicly for any period of time! There's nothing like a suction device to suggest a GPS hiding somewhere in the car.Functionally, it seems to work perfectly, at least on my Passatt's dashboard."
4,"Garmin Dashboard Mount for StreetPilot c310, c320, c330 and c340 (010-10613-00)","This product lets you move your StreetPilot from one vehicle to another with little or no effort. I have noticed that when using it in my Honda CR-V, it tends to move on the dash due to the stiffer suspension. THis is not a big problem but does require me to recenter it occasionally."
3,Better,"Better than the suction cup window one which always falls. I still have to be careful when I hit the gas/brake too hard or turn sharply. It slowly vibrates down the dash and I have to move it, but its better than the suction cup marks and sudden falls with that one.I have one of the older model Garmin C330 units (bigger) I think this would work better on a lighter unit, like the newer ones. I think I need to find a way to add more weights to this."
5,Great!!! Should be included With the Streetpilot,"This works just great. It allows you to move EASILY from one car to the next and doesn't block your vision, like the included mount does. This should be included as the standard mount."
2,Won't Stay on My Dash,"All the reviews are so full of praise, I keep thinking I've done something wrong. This thing slides off my '96 Maxima dash every time I step on the gas from a full stop. However, there's nothing I could have done wrong - you set it on the dashboard - that's it. I mention the make and model of my car in case it is the unique size and shape of my dashboard that is incompatible with this mount. My dash is not deep, so the foremost pad is sloping down towards the driver. It may need a flatter surface to not slide. It doesn't slide side-to-side, which supports this hypothesis."
4,Garmin Dashboard Mount,This works well in most cars that I drive. It's a lot handier than the suction cup holder for transfering from car to another which I do on a frequent basis.
5,DASHBOARD MOUNT,"Very simply, it does what it is supposed to do very well, unlike so many other products"
4,Good Accessory for Dash Mounting C Series StreetPilot GPS,"The mount has somewhat of a large footprint, but other than the size is a very stable external GPS mount for your dashboard. The design allows you the freedom to place the GPS unit any where on your dash or center console."
5,Garmin dash mounting.,"this works great. Originally I used the windshield suction cup, which leaves a dirty circle on the windshield, and makes the screen on GPS too far away from the driver. With this mount, I can have the GPS close to the driver and reading the details on the screen is no problem."
2,not very stable,"i bought this for my garmin streetPilot c340 after reading several online reviews praising its quality and stability... it definitely is not stable and keeps falling off even for normal driving. this keeps sliding and moving on slightly curvy dash-boards all too often. seemed to work better initially but has been getting steadily worse. have also tried it on the dash of an Acura TSX, Corolla and Aveo with similar results: one hand has to be ready to catch the gps unit as it slides off the dash!i'll probably revert to a sticky mount on my dash though i hate the thought of sticking something to it... windshield mount works very well, but is against the law"
3,Garmin Dash Mount only does half the job.,"Ordered the mount for the StreetPilot c330. Item arrived quickly from Amazon in the original bubble pack.The mount fit the c330 perfectly. It sits on the dashboard and doesn't move at all. Exactly what it is supposed to do. The only thing it didn't do is power the c330. The power connection from the DC cord to the c330 is defective. No power came through the mount. When checked with a multimeter, there was no power coming through the contacts to the c330. To make the unit work, I had to change the swivel part of the mount to the same piece from another Garmin windshield mount. Now it works perfectly. Why didn't I send it back? Easier to fix, than return. Garmin, I need another mount. Thanks."
3,Unable to use.,I haven't had a chance to use this product as Amazon has delayed shipment of the GPS unit for over 5 weeks. Very disatisfying. Not the product's fault I guess.
4,Accident concerns,"Um, I don't know if this thought has only crossed my mind, but if you get into an accident, it's assumed that you're moving forward right before you get hit, right? newton's laws of physics state that if there is a sudden directional change, an object will have the tendency to move in the same direction as it was before the directional change. therefore, if a car is moving forwards and suddenly stops, an object that is not secured down is going to continue to move in a forward direction. the unit would most definitely fly and hit the windshield in this case.the only way it would fly backwards and hit someone in the backseat is if you're driving in reverse at a ridiculous speed and come to a screeching stop all of a sudden. and if you're doing that, your children deserve to get smacked around a little.goodness gracious. it's basic physics! silly people."
2,What happens in an Accident?,"I don't think you need to be a PHD in physics to figure that out. It weighs a lot heavier than a infant/toddler/child-mirror, yet it doesn't have any adhesives to hold it down... only weight. Yet, if you get pulled over with small children on board, you'll get a ticket for having one of those child-mirrors.A person is held down in his/her seat by weight alone, and what happens to a person who isn't buckled-in in an accident? That person can becomne a bouncing projectile, and kill the other 3 passengers who ARE bucked-in....Now think about what a small, dense, hard object would do to children in a backseat..."
4,This mount really helps,"We bought this mount because we saw a review on this site that recommended it. We are so glad we bought it. We were a little concerned after ordering it that it would make the unit less portable, but once we received it we realized it makes it even MORE portable."
5,Perfect !!!,"If you have a Garmin GPS, this one will make it stand better a lot. I use it everyday in my car... very firm and stable... Love it!!!"
4,it works,"This unit does the job of holding my Garmin C340 on the dash. It doesn't slide around. I bought it because I thought it would be much easier to use than transferring the mount that goes on the window when I switch cars. I am finding that it is so simple to switch the window mount, I just do that. This mount does the job, works as advertised, but I think in retrospect I'd just plan on switching the window mount... it is easy to do."
5,Super Mount,This mount works just as described. I have a Dodge Durango with a very irregular shaped dashboard and no matter what the road is like it never falls off.
4,Garmin Dashboard MOUNT for StreetPilot,"This tripod mount is an EXCELLENT alternative compared to the original suction mount which frequently fails. As originally designed, the suction attachment (used on either the dashboard or front window) fails within the first ten minutes of driving, leaving the driver scrambling to catch and remount the garmin pilot. Instead, this tripod mount (for dashboard only) does not rely on ""suction"" to secure the garmin streetpilot. This tripod mount is PORTABLE, and far safer to use than the original mount. Now, the Garmin definitely RULES."
4,Simple but effective,"Works pretty well. Totally portable, keeps the unit below your sight lines out the windshield, and doesn't make a mess out of your dashboard. The only drawback is that it tends to slide a bit, but that's likely because my dash has a significant slope to it. Overall a good product."
4,This dash mount works.,"This Garman Dash Mount is heavy enough to hold the GPS solidly in place,and flexable enough to conform to the shape of almost any dash. It's a good solution if the windshield mount puts the touchscreen out of reach."
1,Not worth the money,"This mount was a waste of money. It does not stay in place at all. The dashboard in my Durango is too slick for the friction pads. It is constantly moving around and I have to retrieve it back to its original position. I ended up creating my own mount for my Garmin unit. I do not recommend this mount for anyone who has a newer vehicle with a slick, plastic type of dashboard."
1,Didn't work,"Although made by Garmin this did not properly fit my StreetPilot and it also slipped off my dash, which is rather steeply angled. I returned it."
3,It's ok but it does slip a bit,"Overall it works fine, but it very much depends on your dashboard's surface. Doesn't hold on well on plasticky surfaces (in a Subaru Impreza for exampe). But worked better in toyota avalon."
3,garmin,Did not receive any emails on shipping information until 7 or 8 days after I had already received the item. Took to long
4,One Flaw,"This item is exactly what I needed to use my Garmin GPS unit on the dash of my car. It really works well. However, my only gripe is that I cannot disconnect the cord to it. If I want to use it using the battery only, I have to have the cord hanging...it looks tacky. The original windshield suction mount that came with the unit has a cord that disconnects...I wish the dash mount was the same. Greg Cotta, Tulare, Ca"
3,it's okay but falls off the dashboard easily.,I like the fact that this makes it easy to move the GPS from one vehicle to another but this thing slides off the dash too easliy! I often end up setting it on the middle part of the car or the passenger seat because I don't want it to become a projectile to the back (kiddos seat) if I have to hit the brakes.
4,Garmin,"We used it for the first time this week and found it very easy. It did take a bit of getting used to, but we are pleased."
4,works for me,"This works for me as I had broken the power connection from the windshield mount, so I had no power. The mount itself worked better in my mom's car, a Buick that has a flatter dash, than mine, a Nissan Maxima with a more curved dash. It still works better in my opinion than the windshield mount, but it will slide off on sudden take off."
4,Garmon Dashboard Mount for C310-C340,"After buying a Garmin C340 GPS and having it fall from the windscreen too many times, I had to do something. I had heard of various mounts that would just sit on the dashboard and prevent the GPS from bouncing around the car. I looked at some of the generics but finally decided on the OEM version. It has worked. The dash mount does slide around a wee bit, but it is something that can be handled. The mount is obviously bigger and heavier than the windscreen mount that came with the GPS - and less portable - but it does the trick: it keeps the GPS in one basic place. I thought the cost was a bit pricey, and now I have two sets of power cords, but all-in-all, it is better than the GPS from falling from the windscreen at the most awful moment."
4,Better than the windshield mount,Windshield mount didn't stay stuck to my windshield and the adhesive did not stay stuck to my dash - so tried this and it works great
5,Highly recommended!,This one is a lot better than the original mount that came with the c330 that we purchased in 2005. Very portable. Easy to transfer from one car to another. No need to permanently attach to the dashboard. Highly recommended.
5,Great GPS,I read the reviews and decided on this particular model of the Garmin GPS. I really enjoy taking it with me on trips. The only drawback is that it loses its connection to the satellite frequently.
4,Worth the money,"I figured that the standard suction cup mount would not be effective, so when I purchased my new GPS last month I had immediately starting researching mounting devices. Based upon the good reviews here, I decided to purchase this one and I am glad I did. The ""installation"" was easy; the most difficult part was taking it out of the box. It holds the GPS in place, is easily portable and non-obtrusive. My only concern is that I'm not sure whether this device would be a dangerous projectile in the event of a collision. Other than that, this is definitely worth the money and my 4.5 stars. (I would rank the suction cup mount a ""1"" because it did not keep my device affixed to the windshield.)"
1,"It didn't charge my GPS, left me all alone at Grand Canyon","I was constantly having problems with the charging with this mount. When I went to trip from Vegas to grand canyon, it didn't charge. We were left without any maps/guides. Called garmin for replacement..."
1,Dash Mount for C340,I purchased the dash mount for my Garmin C340. After 4 months of use it does not always charge the battery inside the unit. This happens when I use the 340 in other vehicles I drive.
4,At last! My Garmin stays put.,"I am delighted with this product. The picture is not that clear, nor is the description. There is no suction cup anywhere--the bracket that comes with it slides into a locking mount in the center of the tripod base. Simply lay the assembly where you want it and it stays. Sudden stops, quick turns, nothing moves it. My dashboard is not at all level, and it never moves unless I move it. It is very easy to pick up the whole assembly and tuck it under your seat, leaving no visible evidence that it is in the car.I purchased this after almost getting in an accident trying to catch my falling Garmin C-340 for the umpteenth time on a hot day, and my only regret it that I didn't buy it sooner. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I have a minor problem with the power cord I can't seem to solve--it sometimes jiggles loose and the unit tries to convert to battery power, which requires driver input on the C-340."
1,doesn't work,I own a Honda CR-V. This product falls off of the dashboard every time I accelerate. Sometimes it just tips over and hangs by the wire. Not so goof.
5,Street Pilot c330 Mount,"Arrived earlier than expected, and performs very well. I use it in two vehicles."
5,Extends the useful life of my Garmin,"I was about to retire my Garmin StreetPilot C340 when the suction cup mount lost its grip, so I ordered this dashboard mount to extend the life of the GPS unit. It works fine. The mount consists of a floppy tripod of metal weights encased in rubber, which manages to stay in place on any part of the dashboard that comes close to being flat. I've only had the mount topple over once when I had to brake hard. I had to get accustomed to using lighter pressure on the touchscreen, but I'm now used to it. An added benefit: I can simply hide the entire GPS unit elsewhere in the car when I'm parked in a public space, reducing the chance of catching the eye of a burglar."
4,good product,This product works as advertised. It is heavy enough to stay in place on the dashboard. It is just slightly cumbersome to slide the plastic holder into the base. I do recommend this product if you don't want to have the GPS stuck to your window.
5,A must have for Garmin,This mount works as well as the adhesive mount that arrived with the Garmin 340(discontinued model)and has the portability I need for 3 cars. After a rash of GPS thefts local police advise removing the adhesive disk and even cleaning off the tell tale circle shadow it leaves.
5,I like it,"I like the dash mount a lot better than the window suction mount. The front windshield of my car has a very steep rake and getting the suction cup on there is always an exercise to see how flexible I am. With the dash mount, I can place the gps anywhere I want, it stays in place and I can move it around whenever I want. It's a very good upgrade that I would recommmend to anyone who does not like the little circles the suction cup leaves behind on the windshield or who has difficulty reaching the window to hook it up."
5,Sticks almost anywhere,"Wanting to use this in multiple personal cars and for rentals on business trips, the purchase was a no-brainer. So far, on a variety of dashboards I found it will stick pretty much anywhere that is moderately flat and level. On the HHR's seriously sloped dash, it very slowly slid down over the course of an hour or two, and it tended to flop around a bit on the uneven dash of the Pontiac G6. If it can't get all three feet pretty much on the same plane, it's not going to stay put on tight turns. But for most vehicles it's fantastic."
4,Improvement over suction cup,"Purchased the Garmin dashmat holder to replace the included suction cup mount. With the suction cup the unit was too far away and not easy to reach. The dashmat holder allows the device to be placed in most any location. There is a slight shake of the unit but not a factor, the unit stays in place well on the dash and does not slide at all. Good alternative to the other holder methods."
5,Works exremely well,"I am very pleased with this product. I think the newer models of this tripod have the abiliy to have a removable cigratte power adapter cord, like mine. This is great, for those times when you don't need to plug in the power adapter because your GPS has enough battery power. There were some complaints/reviews that griped of the inability to remove the power cord. If that had been the case with mine, then I would have ranked it 4 stars. Garmin, thank you for listening to your customers. Only gripe: cost. It should be included w/the Garmin purchase, instead of the abysmal windshield suction mount.This product works flawlessly and does not move (despite my driving :-) in our Toyota Camry or 4Runner."
4,garmin c330 dash mount,Satisfied. My old craddle woulod no longer charge the GPS. The swivel would no longer hold the gps tightly. This solved both of my problems.
5,Best way to mount your GPS!,"My GPS came with the other mount that suctions to a window, but my van's windows are too deep and slanted for it to work. My husband bought me this Dash mount, and I LOVE it! I can sit the GPS in a variety of places, and it swivels around for me to see it from any angle. This mount is far superior to the one that came with my GPS. You can't go wrong with this purchase!"
2,Problems Problems,"The unit fits all of our cars perfectly.It looks fine.THE PROBLEM, is that the mount to attach the GPS to does nto make good contact with the unit and it continues to lose power. My unit works perfectly when attached tot he suction mount that caem with the uni"
3,Not as good as everyone says,I thought this mount would stay wherever i put it. This is not the case. You need a level surface with lots of room to hold. If you are on a bumpy road the mount will move and then fall off. Happened to me twice. Wound up with a bruise on my knee the second time it happened.Disappointed!!
5,Garmin Dashboard Mount,This is very nice to have I did not have to worry about my GPS moving it stayed in place. It is better than the windshield mount.
4,Garmin Dashboard Mount,This tripod dash mount is great. You can see the screen well and it stays in place....we really love it and are glad we got it. We had previously had the mount that stuck to the glass and the suction cup melted to the windshield. This new tripod type is excellent...stays in place...no complaints. You can also lift the whole unit up at once to put away...no more connecting and unconnecting of the unit from the mount. GREAT!
3,Sliding GPS Mount,"The idea of not using a suction cup for my GPS sounded great, so I ordered this product. It is a weighted GPS mount that sits on your dashboard. The only problem is that it's not weighted enough, so it does slide around a bit, especially when you turn or hit a speed bump."
4,Decent Dash Mount,"I bought this dash mount for my C340 because my suction mount no longer stuck to the window after about a year. The dash mount works ok. It is easy to get the Garmin in/out of the mount and I am pretty sure it is nearly impossible for the mount to topple over while driving. I have taken some hard turns and it barely budged. I have 2 problems with this mount. The first is that it's so expensive. The second is that it tends to shuffle around on my dash. When I hit bumps it moves a little, so every now and then I'll have to bring it back to where it originally was on my dash. Not a huge deal, but still annoying.This is an ok dash mount, but definitely not perfect. I have to say it is better than the suction mount because it will last longer than a year."
4,Its a good design,"I use this mount with a c340 Street Pilot. It is well built and well designed. The footprint on this mount is bigger than the sand bag design. The mount does move a little bit, but it is nothing to worry about. I have taken my c340 attached to this mount down a rough, bumpy, washboard, gravel road and the mount only slid a couple of inches after 25 minutes of driving. The c340 was never in danger.I really prefer this mount to the suction cup that came with the c340. It doesn't leave marks on my windshield and I feel like my navigator is safe from falls. I feel that the suction cup or the ring left behind makes you a mark as a traveler and opens you up to any problems that come with that distinction such as theft."
2,Doesn't Work.,"This product doesn't work at all, at least not on my scion's dash. It just slides off."
2,Garmin holder,"Only problem with this is that it won't fit all dashboards. Although the GPS can be easily attached and removed from the unit, the unit is not compatible with the many configurations of dashboards."
5,Excellent upgrade from factory mount,This mount makes the Garmin unit much more user friendly. If the factory suction cup caused the unit to fall off the windshield one more time...causing my wife to scream... one more time...was going to throw the whole thing out the window. Now we're all happy again. It does what it is supposed to do...keep the GPS on the dashboard.
5,It really works,"This thing looks like it won't really do the job, but once you put it down, it really does not move. This should come in the original box with the GPS. It's far superior to the suction cup that decides to pop off whenever the temperature changes."
4,Excellent Product except for....,"I've never had a GPS unit before, was using mapquest to get around. But when I tried this unit out, was very pleased. Only ""issue"" I have with it is the start up time. Takes a good long minute or two to actually get connected with or ""ping"" with the satellites. Other than that, voice quality is understandable and directions are read out throughout the trip (when approaching a turn or forks in the road). Not ultra recommended but good enough for entry level. (Got the C340, which basically has text to speech ie. says ""Left on Main Rd"" rather than ""Left in 500 feet"".)"
4,Garmin GPS dashboard friction mount,Sits very nicely on the dashboard of our 2005 Saturn ION. Only shortcoming noted is that it can fly off the dashboard if you accelerate a little too quickly. Highly recommend for times you don't want or can't use the windshield mount.
5,A great work-around for a Dodge Caravan with the long sloping windshield,"I bought this dashboard mount for my Garmin c330 so that I could use it in our Dodge Caravan. The long sloping windshield prevents the regular Garmin windshield mount from working well, so this seemed like a good alternative. The weighted pads seem to provide more than enough stability for the c330 when set up on the Caravan's dash just to the right of the instrument pod. In all other respects, the mount works just like the windshield mount - the Garmin clips right in with a locking connector, the power from the cigarette lighter socket is routed right into the back of the Garmin, and its easy to remove from the dash when parking so as to avoid the GPS smash-and-grab that seems to be popular around here in parking lots and city streets."
1,It just doesn't work properly,"Contrary to other reviewers, I found this mounting unit to be totally unsatisfactory, because it DOES slide all over the dashboard (I did mount it properly), and the placement of the GPS causes a nightime relection on the windshield, which is annoying.I sent it back after trying every way to make it work without sliding all around. The only way I could figure would have been to duct tape the base to the dash!"
4,Bill,"This product is very good, easy to use. It does tend to slip around on the plastic dachboard, but not enough to worry about."
5,excellent design,"can be used again and again on windshield whenever heat or cold sets it looser. Fast delivery, thanks :)"
4,Dashboard mount for Garmin c340 auto GPS,"I have used this mount in two different vehicles. As long as the dashboard surface is clean and smoothly contoured, the mount is almost perfect. When the weighted ""toes"" of the mount cannot contact dashboard surface because of the shape, the mount does move around a little.Addition of a small suction cup under the center of the mount would solve this problem.I highly recommend this mount, especially because it makes it easy to remove the GPS unit from view without much work. This leaves no trace of a unit and is a good theft deterrent."
5,Works great,The suction cup that comes with the Garmin does not work and this is definately what everyone needs to keep the Garmin from falling and getting broken.
4,Stays In Place!,The Garmin dashboard mount holds the Garmin Streetpilot unit securely in place on the dashboard in my vehicle. It also can be removed easily (without leaving any marks as does the suction mount on the windshield) so the system can be hidden from view from the outside of the vehicle.
4,Garmin Dash Mount,"In California, no windshield inside mounts are allowed. The Garmin Dash mount solution addresses this problem very well. It sticks to the dash and does not slide about. It is a little on the heavy side but the weight helps hold it in place. In a hard frontal auto accident it would be tossed into the windshield so there is some collison risk to your StreetPilot(but to you too). It has many pluses- high build quality, holds the GPS firmly, can be easily moved between cars, and has a charging jack built in. The minuses are few- heavy, might not fit a sculptured dash found in some cars, and its a little awkward to carry. Overall I am impressed with it."
4,"Needs a case, otherwise it's like carrying a small octopus around","This contraption really is good when you plan on using the Street Pilot in rental cars etc. But, it needs a case since it is like a small octopus on a leash and not easy to throw in your briefcase."
5,Great accessory - this should be given with the product instead of the suction cup,"I bought the C340 recently and have been very satisfied with it. However, the suction cup mount gave me trouble on my recent trip to california. I had attached the suction mount to the rental car. After two weeks of roaming in the California sun, I was stunned when I found out that the suction cup had fused to windshield. I couldnt get it off and so had to shop for a new mount. This dash mount is really good especially since it is not glued or vacuum attached to anything. The product description on amazon ""the mount is hardware-free: simply attach the included adhesive disks--one for each leg--and then connect the StreetPilot to the top."" gives the impression that it uses adhesive which is incorrect. I am very satisfied with this product"
4,Fantastic !!!!,"It is superb !!!! it is basically an equivalent of bean bag mount for C series. it doesn't slip so easliy, even in rough turns. Garmin is truly an innovator !!! This mount works perfectly for a curvy dash board & for flat ones as well.It is friction based, no adhesive, screws, stiking on windshield etc.Only one Q: Wonder what will happen in a crash, will this fly & hit my children in the back ? this will be scary, i hope not. the reason i am worried is that the 3 bases are darn heavy !"
2,Non-Essential Collection of Miscellany,"This book *seems* to have the right ingredients: Contributions from Beat scholar John Tytell, historian Douglas Brinkley, and underground luminaries like Neil Hennesey and Lee Renaldo. The fans that this book is targeted to, however, will most likely find it a thin, disappointing collection of dross.The 'previously unpublished interviews' reveal little that hasn't been published elsewhere, apart from the fact that Burroughs was either exceedingly patient or bored stiff with the people who insisted on asking him the same questions he'd been asked over and over again for the past 40 years.Published shortly after Burroughs' death, this is a non-essential collection of miscellany that has the unfortunate feel of a quickly assembled cash-in."
4,Easy-to-follow to make perfect Japanese anime-style graphics,A great book for beginners to intermediate CG designers. It really opened up the various functions of Photoshop to me and the easy-to-follow steps give a perfect introduction to the Japanese style of CG art.
2,Below Average,"This book details the life of a KGB agent, his career in the organization and an overview of what they do and how they do it. It comes off as a very high level, average and uninspiring work. There is just nothing new here. The book was a little run of the mill. The story sounded like it would be full of interesting stories from this former KGB agent. We get some interesting details on how operations are planned and carried out, some detail on the trade craft and recruitment, but overall the wooden written and the lack of large amounts of new information make this a book only suited to someone that is really interested in learning everything they possibly can about the KGB. There are better books on this topic."
3,"Low on drama, high on logistics","This book affirms that spying is not the romantic, action-packed drama of a Le Carre novel or 007 film, but a game of chess: slow-paced with high underlying tension. The most interesting parts were the discussions on how they recruit and maintain sources of information: rather than valuing these contacts, most are viewed quite disdainfully, treated as the KGB's pawns, and seen as generally untrustworthy."
4,"In the 20/80 rule, this is the 20 to get you 80% on route.","A very good and flexible guide. It will take a lot of development out of your hands and can very easily be adapted to meet your (clients) needs.Unless you have enough time on your hands to re-invent the wheel of developing workshops on this important subject, this guide is the best there is to get you started at the near-end of creating a very good workshop."
1,Warning,Will give you artiritis of the spirit. Please listen to Sonic Youth and Velvet Underground instead.
4,Hard to describe in words,One song sounds like troops of doom from Sepultura and the others are in their own sound respectively. I would say it is a steady moving atmosphere with long drawn out bass and guitars. If you are curious about your music this sound is a definite to listen to.
3,Not what we expected. Very boring and disappointing!,"We were disappointed with this. We were waiting for them to tackle up the whole alphabet in the movie....but to no avail. My son was not even thrilled with the movie itself (compared to their 123). He looks bored and does a lot of yawning to this. He'd ask for his WTP 123 instead. They just touched on very few letters, which doesn't even emphasize on them well. The Leap Frog Letter Factory is so much better. I would not recommend this especially for beginners. They might think that's all what the alphabet is about. Don't get this. Get the Leap Frog's version instead. But if your child adores Winnie the Pooh so much, get the 123 instead. A 3-star for some great credits like the animations & sounds."
1,Disappointed-,"I bought this video for my 2 1/2 year old because he is very interested in the alphabet. The dvd was a huge disappointment because it didn't deal with letters but focused on rhyming words, etc. Not suitable for my son's age, boring and short. They sing a 60 second song with the alphabet that is an extra feature and that was the only thing he liked. Not a good buy."
2,Disappointed,Not what I expected at all. The actual show didnt really have to do alot with teaching the letters. You have to go to the special features to get all the letters and it is so boring. The Leap Frog Letter Factory is so much better in my opinion and it also teaches letter sounds not just the letters alone and it does it in such a fun way.
1,Too advanced for a 3 year old,"For children just learning their alphabets, this video is too advanced. It doesn't even have the ""alphbet song"".It has rhyming and ""spelling"" that is currently being taught to my first and second grader (i.e. words like: ""near"" ""sky"" """"stop"" ""friends"")The story line is too distracting.Teaching lessons are too far apart to be beneficial.Disappointing a multibillion dollar company couldn't spend a little on a consultant familiar with teaching preschoolers.These videos, ""Pooh's 123"" and ""Pooh's ABC"" has convinced me not to trust Disney on education videos.This is not a video for a preschooler, and only a review for older children already know how to spell."
1,Does Little to Entertain Much Less Educate,"Pooh! I can't believe I spent $15 on this video. It is soooo BORING and miserably lacking in educational value. My little girl wouldn't give it the time of day. I had patience, though, and waited to see how it might redeem itself by creatively introducing letters and sounds to promote alphabet recognition and beginning phonics skills. Disney should have hired a phonics instructor or a reading teacher to guide them in learning theory before promoting this movie as ""educational."" Good for the Pooh collector, that's it."
2,Expected More !,"I bought this for my 3 year old who doesn't seem interested in learning his ABC's. I thought at the very least the video would go through each letter but seems to only touch on the beginning letters of the Pooh characters. (The rest of the alphabet can be viewed in the extras) I was VERY DISAPPOINTED and it did not hold my child's interest well at all. It was recommended I buy the Leap Frog Letter Factory DVD and it is EXCELLENT, my son has learned the alphabet and most of the phonics sounds in two weeks!Don't buy this, not much bang for your buck."
4,Children's DVD,"This DVD was bought as a gift, for a Spanish speaking family. They wanted their young daughter to learn English, and get a good grasp of language skills, so she could learn English as a second language. I did help keep her motivated, and she enjoyed watching and learning with the ABC's and also the 123'SExcellent learning tool"
4,Doesn't really teach the alphabet,"The title is a bit deceiving. This video doesn't really cover the ABC""s. Pooh looses the pages to a book of poems that Christopher Robin has written about the different characters. In order to get the book in the right order, they must rhyme the last word of the previous poem to the first word of the next poem. They then learn to write the first letter of each of their names. There is, however, a short video that sings the ABC song in the bonus features. If you're looking for a specific ABC teaching aid, I'd look somewhere else, but if you love Pooh, or your little one does, it's still a cute video that has some educational merit."
1,Very Disappointing,"This video promises to teach your child the alphabet but only presents, I believe, 5 of the 26 letters. It speaks more of rhyming than of letters and proves to be somewhat confusing to it's base audience. My almost 2 1/2 year old daughter, who already knows the alphabet by sight, was bored with this movie. It does not come close to it's sister video ""Winnie the Pooh's 123's"" which is educational and wonderfully done."
5,"The Super Bowl is near, Win you are champs, Lose...","This game is the best football around, while DSF has more of a complex system along with madden, TSB NES IS CLASSIC. there are injuries and recoveries, an injury will play a musical sting called ""Hurting"" plays while the injured is helped off the field of the TECMO referee and the TECMO First-Aid Team. When a player is recovered, you see the player running out of the hospital while a sting called ""Recover"", the nurses wave good-bye and good luck to the recovered player while the display says""TECMO FLASH!""(Name Of Player)[Flashing Lights] ""RECOVERED!""The game play is simplistic and easy, difficult it is although!"
5,best game ever,Get Bo Jackson and go go go!!! this game brings me back! Definitely a must buy to any boy who was a child in the late 80's!
5,Best Football game Ever!!!,"Madden, NFL 2K sports, and others have tried to create better products. However, over the years, even today with todays' techonology and graphics, nothing beats the old game of Tecmo Super Bowl. There is still a cult following after 20 years of being released. I remember playing this game as a kid and between the era of football and adjustable rosters and playbooks, it was simply way ahead of it's time. It's a game that playing doesn't get old. You don't feel like it's going to be outdone or overdone by next years release. Becuase it's perfect the way that it is."
5,Best football emulator,"This is simply one of the best nintendo games ever made, and the best football emulator of its time. Real time stat tracking, playing a whole season (with playoffs) either vs. the computer or your friends, and using real NFL teams/players, it was way way ahead of its time and is still as addictive now as it was then. Sure it has some goofy play aspects that are bogus in terms of ""real football"", but it's still a challenging skill game, and definitely a nostalgic favorite for anyone still using the original NES... either with the old TV game box or using an emulator online. This one set the bar for football emulators, and it still stacks up well with the new ones today."
5,Good way to start learning,"I purchased this book because I wanted to know more about mushroom culture. While it is true that several sections are far more detailed than the casual grower needs to know, I do not consider that a detriment. It helped give me some insights on log and wood chip culture for personal use, and now I have a much better idea of what will work in my part of the country without keeping everything inside. If you have ever been curious about growing mushrooms, this is a good read before deciding to jump in."
5,Great guide book,Everything you need to know about growing mushrooms. Very informative. Bought this as a gift and ended up buying another for personal use.
5,Couldn't be better,You will not find a better guide on the subject. If you are lookin' to grow fungi -- get it.
5,AMAZING,Absolutely full of the best information written by the MAN himself! I love this book! + + + + +
4,Great for your reference library!,Very comprehensive with a lot of detail about any kind of mushroom you could immagine! It's a great book to keep in your Garden library and refer to if you have any questions about growing mushrooms. It's applicable to the beginner and the experienced mushroom grower and will satisfy the science geeks that are interested in fungi. I think it's so informative that I've featured it on my new blog about mushroom growing: [...]
4,A great book with a lot of detail to it...,There's a lot of pictures inside the book but the disappointing thing is they all 90% in black & white which keeps you guessing to what the mushrooms actually look like in colour! Shouldn't authors be more specific to their detail in pictures especially when there so many poisonous mushrooms out there in the wild?
4,Helps to be a mycologist,A great book for growing mushrooms. However it's about twice as long as it should be. Most people don't need to know how to grow tons of mushrooms; and the information on commercial growing could have been omitted. The vast majority of people who would buy this book simply want to grow a few mushrooms for their personal table use.
5,saved my marriage,This contraption saved my marriage. We went on a road trip to Massachusetts for our honeymoon. Boston is not the easiest city to get around in. Our c320 kept us out of poor navigation fights.Thanks Garmin!!!
3,Is it really on discount?,This product is available on Garmin site @ $350. That means this product is not being sold by Amazon at a discount it claims to be.This market gimmick is certainly not appreciative and not expected from Amazon.
5,Great value,"This GPS system is very helpful. I bought it mainly for the roadtrips that I like to go on, but it is also very helpful in my hometown. It is so easy to find gas stations and hotels too."
4,Easy to use and good value for your money.,"This unit is great for the price I paid ($450.00 including shipping and taxes). The screen and usability is amazing clear and easy to use. I was ready to go in 1/2 hour once I received it. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I have two issues so far:1. The screen is little difficult to see in the bright sunlight, so you have to really stare at it.2. The routing algorithm has a few bugs. The map told me to turn left but the voice prompt told me to turn right. I knew where I was going that time so I did not get lost. But even then the recalculation is pretty fast.Overall, a pleasure to use this GPS and I am really enjoying my trips to Downtown Boston without any sweat."
2,"OK unit, but others are better, and beware the update costs!","I've owned this unit for a couple years and it has served me well, but even with one map update, there were a fair amount of ""missing"" roads. When I found out the latest map update costs $75, I started looking elswhere. Bought a cheap a Navigon product as a gift and the display and interface make the C320 look like Pong from the 70's. Navigon map updates are FREE, as well as traffic data subscriptions on the better units. You can actually email Navigon support, and they've emailed me back three times within a couple hours! Everything I wished the C320 had, even the little Navigon LOOX has: altitude, lat-long, ability to drag the map around to see what's around you, and a boat load of other ""wow!"" features. I'm a Navigon convert!"
5,Love it,My wife is jealous......... but Garmin and I have a special relationship.........How did I ever live without it?
4,Worth the price,"I have been using this GPS for 5 months now. It is a good buy. The only thing I wish was there- If could speak out the street names as well while taking turns. This feature is a part of newer models like Garmin Nuvi, but thats double price of Garmin C320."
5,How did I get along without it??/,This product is amazing. I started a new job on the other side of the state of Florida. I got miserably lost in this new area untill I purchased my Street Pilot. I now have no worries of getting lost or being late. I can find anything or anywhere on the navigator and it takes me there with no hassle. Technology is wonderful!!! I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Everyone who drives should have one.
4,"Good GPS Unit, with all the needed features","This is a sufficient size car GPS unit.Brigntess OKSatallite Acquire time OKVolume for voice prompt OKAttractions/POI OKI have loaded latest ver on 1GB SD card with most of my east coast area.Problem: I have noticed that even after acquiring satellite, unit does not start giving directions immediately till you move for some time. At times it will give message only after you have made a turn (most often wrong!)."
4,"Excellent product, Mounting options limited","This GPS was purchased for medical reasons and within one month has already paid its worth is stress relief.The touch screen is simple, logical, and has a specific ""Go Home"" selection that can be touched to get my family member home from anywhere at any time.I give the product a 5+++ alone; however I was not impressed with the mounting bracket.Because I needed the mounting bracket (not the GPS unit) to be permanently mounted in the car, there was no simple way of integrating it in to the rounded surfaces. The only option is an ugly black tripod device permanently glued to the dash board (our car has a tan interior). It's hard to fault Garmin for this because of the possibility of people interfering with their airbag systems, but it was a problem for me none-the-less.Regardless, I am extremely impressed with the product and its function. I built and installed a modified permanent mount, so everything is working great now."
4,Awesome GPS unit for budget buyers,"This is a excellent GPS unit for people who are looking for just GPS and no fancy stuff like Bluetooth, MP3 etc. Buy 1 GB SD card to store full America Maps in that, it will same as C330.Cons1. First time it takes some time to connect to satellites (app 2 mins).2. It alarms at .9 mile then .4 mile and then just before 200 m to the turn. The last one did not give you time to correct yourself.3. If you stopped in between to fill gas, getting back on your route is not 1 click."
4,Good ...but not great.,"My Garmin is easy to use and it really makes it easy to find places when you're out of town - i.e. - found a supermarket close to the hotel. However, it doesn't always give you the best route to take. Overall, I'm happy with the unit."
1,Great value and esay to use.. but...,Great GPS for the value. I loved the Navigation..But the GPS holder broke in the first month..The air suction does not hold the GPS to the wind shield or nor in the provided circular frame. I'm trying to get the GPS/holder replaced.
4,Great navigator for the price,"i have purchased three of these units now, one for my sister, one for my brother, and one for myself. it will definitely get you where you need to go - one warning though! in florida the suction cup mount will become permanently attached in only a few days! i purchased a friction type dash mount for transfer to other vehicles."
3,Good product for Price,"Product works well and price was hard to pass up. Doesn't always fine the best/fastest route, but rest assured you will make it to your final destination. The only major problems I've experience is with poor satellite reception. On several occasions, I have lost satellite reception and was forced to navigate on my own. The last time I lost reception, it didn't return until several hours later."
3,Amazon is manipulating the customer,"I have just purchased this item and am disappointed at the way Amazon is marketing this. Their retail price say the unit is listed for over $700 and the Garmin site has it for a little over $300. They also list a very limited number left for sale (1 item left) that didn't drop when I bought mine... It was still a good deal on a great unit, but I thought Amazon was better than this!!!"
3,GPS is good but...,"It is a good GPS and response fast, but the problem is that it is quite easy to fall down from the window, maybe cause it's too heavy. So it's not convinous to use."
3,Law enforcement patrols,I have been very pleased with the StreetPilot. It is very useful on patrols at night where street signs can be difficult to read and house numbers missing. I found the loading instructions easy to follow and was able to make full use of it the first day.
3,Pretty Well Rounded GPS,"I like the quick reroute or detour button. Very useful when you run into road constructions or roadblock in area that you are not familiar. The POI(Points of Interest) is great. Map software is up to date & excellent. Response time from power on to aquire satellite signal is almost instantaneous(1~3sec). Birdeye view angle is not adjustable, so certain area in busy streets will make it hard to read. The direction arrow is way bigger than it should be. Speaker volume is good but when cranking up the volume the difference in loudnest from let's say 80% loudness to 100% is very different in loudness, the volume adjustment are not granular or smooth. 20% to 80% loudness is almost hard to distinguish. The size claim to be portable, but still too thick to in glove box. Dash mount has a very good & strong suction cup. But the wire is built in to the mount, so you can't remove it if you want to. It's not bad, but not great either. I still like my Navman ICN 510 better."
4,Good item with great price,"I recommend this navigator for someone need to buy a basic navigator with a great price. You just need to spend some time to install the map software and upload the states you are interested in. The memory card of course doesn't take everything, maybe you can think of memory upgrade later. Sometimes accuracy problem took place but I think it's a weather issue."
4,GPS Review,We bought it for our son in law since we have one and he loved ours. It works like a charm. When your car does not come with a GPS this is wonderful and we take it on our trips with us. We pack it in our suitcase and when we get our rental car at an airport we are ready to go with the GPS.
5,"great gps, great value","This is the easiet GPS I have used so far. It is true you have to load up the map, but I got a 1GB sandisk, allows me to load 1/2 the US at once, and you only have to do it once...I am sure in the long run, C320 should be more reliable than c330, b/c it does not have the hard drive. I found it to be very accurate, and the screen is just perfect. I do not have any problem with the suction cup falling off the windshield for almost a month now..It is not perfect, some exits on the highway are a bit confusing, but just slow down a bit, and read the title on the screen instead of listening the voice prompt. I blame on the poor design of the roadway, not GPS..Also map is not perfect... Just like any new car.. once you get warm up, it will be a perfect companion for the car..."
3,satisfied,"the gps system works well, i expected the system to say the name of the street or road you should make the turn on.i should have asked more guestins."
5,C320 Garmin StreetPilot,I love this product! Good price and the touch screen makes it so easy to use. Screen size seemed like it might be small but I was pleasantly surprised that it was very easy to see and read while driving.
4,Good product with flaw,"This is a very nice GPS. Easy to use and accurate in 95% of time.There are only two cons: It won't work when air temperature is below 50. Searching could be very slow sometimes. Otherwise, it would be excellent. Highly recommended for general user."
4,Garmin c320,"This is a great product! It's very easy to use and gets you where you want to go. I wish it came with a bigger memory card to load more maps, but then I could purchase a larger one too. I like the fact it gives you off roads as well and you are able to update your maps via the Internet."
4,"Good item, well priced","Product has its limitations, but it does a good job. Good value for the price."
4,good,this GPS does everything I need it to do. It gets me from point A to B. The only bad thing is that it doesn't warn you about traffic or anything else like that.
5,what a life saver,"I bought this a while back and played it for a few days, then I just left it in my glove compartment and forgot about it since my commute is pretty much limited from home to work and work to home. I was driving to my work today and heard over the radio that 3 lanes ahead were blocked on the freeway, one lane blocked is bad enough in LA, let alone 3 lanes. So I took it out from the glove compartment and hit a few buttons, sure enough it gave me a detour route, which helped me get to work a lot quicker than it would have if I had been on the freeway, 20 minutes later, a coworker of mine showed up and was complaining about the traffic and was surprised how I could get here earlier than he did, normally he comes to work on time, and I am always 15-20 minutes late, guess what, it's the C320 that made the difference."
4,Garmin C320 GPS,The only reason I didnt give it a 5 was because no GPS is perfect. This one couldnt be easier to use right out of the box with no prior experience needed. Wife was skeptical about it as a gift but now loves it. Maps are good and business phone numbers very helpful. Bonus for me is that the CD maps also work on my Garmin GPS which I bought for my boat but also now works in my car. Although it cost over twice as much and is about 10 times harder to use!
4,path calculation needs to be enhanced,"Generally speaking, this model is good enough for drivers to find the way. The drawback is the calculation algorithm, sometimes it will instruct you a funny way to go."
4,happy with purchase,Great product. Works fantastically. I have a problem with the unit charging. The power supply blows it's fuse every so often. I don't know why. Besides that it works great. I would recommend the purchase of a powersupply so it can be charged in the house and not just in the car.
3,It will do for now,"Had to get something for now and would not spend too much. This seemed like not so bad thing, the biggest concern was the size of the screen. Got into local FRY'S and checked out the c330, the size looked good enough to use it, so I ordered the c320 from Amazon.Needed just something simple for wife to use when she gets lost, and this seems like good unit for that. I will not mention the good, but just the bad as I always want to know problematic spots when deciding to buy stuff.1 - as it was said, the unit takes a while to acquire the signal when turned on. I suggest to turn the unit on a bit sooner before you start driving.2 - encountered few satellite signal looses in areas where I would expect the unit to work flawlessly, but I had the unit in the middle of the car at the time, so perhaps that might be a factor, perhaps should think about external antenna"
2,Garmin - Inaccuracy at a price,"I found one of these for $200, and based on the reviews I figured I'd be pleasantly surprised.I thought wrong.Not only are the maps highly inaccurate, but it doesn't give enough notice on when to turn, so missing turns is quite common. The routes this thing takes aren't usually the optimal choice, and it likes to avoid the highway even though it's on the default settings. So you end up taking a ton of back roads that really slow down your trip. I recently missed a trip to the movie theater because of this unit. When it said I was arriving at the destination, it brought me to a field. That's right, a FIELD.Not only am I out the $200 for this inaccurate POS, but I'm out $20 for the movie tickets. Thanks a lot, Garmin."
4,A Great GPS If it still works!,"It is a great product. I only had a proble getting somewhere, twice, so far. But, I onlyhad it for 3 weeks. I turned it on today and it shut back off and wont turn back on."
1,Not So Good,We bought it about 1 month ago. It malfunctioned the first day..got stuck. It worked OK for 2 weeks and then again it started to malfunction. It keeps losing satellite reception every 10 minutes. I am returning it!
2,"Inacurate ""Estimated arrival time""","The C320, including the updated version 2.8, is full of imperfections and has so far 1 bug: once the gps calculates the route, it gives the estimated arrival time on the lower left corner of the screen. This time is never accurate and does NOT take into account your speed. For example, if you are stuck in traffic for 30 min, the ETA remains almost the same (the ETA can be 8:45 while the current time is 9:15!!!).On the iQue 3600, the ETA is accurate +/- 1 min, it is constantly adjusted to the traffic and your speed."
1,Never buy this stuff,"1. This frequently dooesn't work on a cloudy day or near an airport2. I live in NY and my work in Manhattan. But This only works normal only in 1/3 area in manhattan even with gps antena I bought seperatively(20dollor).3. It comes with 128 m memory card. But It can not have the minimal size of Map;Map for one state. So I had to buy 1 Mb SD card(40 dollor)4. It responds too late on a highway that I had to wait or go wrong way.5. Whenever I go long journey, I have to change Map with my Laptop notebook.6. Finaly I had to buy another one(c530). Unfortunately total price for c320. gps anttena and meory card was almost same as sigle c 530.7. Never buy this one please."
2,WARNING - CAN'T USE IN EUROPE UNLESS YOU FORK OUT ADDITIONAL $350!,Garmin provides little information on the portability of this unit outside US/Cananda. Their websites for C320 and their Mapsource products (eg. City navigator) do not clearly indicate that customer must purchase a full mapsource edition (US$350!) to use outside the US. The C320 website is deceptive and suggests you can upgrade to a Europe mapsource CD for only $50. Competitor products are usually comparable and much cheaper for use across both continents.
4,"good gadget, bad customer service","There was a discount on this item right after I gave my order so I called for a price match and the CSR asked me to reject the first delivery and wait for the new order with new lower price, which means Amazon will pay for 3 times shipping cost and I will have to wait for more days! what a solution!This is a very good GPS system though. I substract onw star only for Amazon's service.Also, I suggest to hold your orders since recently Amazon's changing its price so frequently."
1,Sucked,Nice Idea but this product never did work for me. It frozed up soon as I started to use it. That Sucked!!!
4,Garmin C320,Very nice unit for the money. You will need a 2GB SD card to fit all of the maps. (it comes wth a 128MB)The detail in maps is amazing. On a recent roadtrip into the middle of Arkansas it had dirt roads in the database! I have come to love this unit and would buy it again without a thought!!! Just bought the european software and drove 3900 miles thru Scotland and England with amazing accuracy!!!
4,Excellent Product,"Love this navigation system, it has all the features that I need and more. Great built and extremely easy to use. Highly recommend the sd card, gives you the flexibility of loading as much or as little as you want. The 128 MB that came with it has been enough for me at the moment. I live in NJ and traveled to Boston this week, took it with me, excellent gadget to have. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars it's that it sometimes looses the satelite signal in cities with tall buildings and sometimes it may take some time to aquire the satelites. It doesn't bother me too much."
2,Took a lot to get it working.....,"Had to update this on the Garmin website, that took 10 hours. Then loading the maps took another four hours. But so far it seems to be working and for the price I'd say it's worth it.The mount is totally useless in my Suburban, when mounted on the windshield it is too far away to see whats on the screen. And if you want to use the vehicle charging cable the unit MUST be in the mount. The charger cable plugs into the mount, not the unit. Very inconvenient, I'll have to buy another mount for it.Nothing to do with this unit specifically, but Garmin has tried to kill me several times already: Told me to turn right when I was on a bridge; turn and go over railroad tracks, where no crossing exists; and told me to turn several times onto nonexistent streets. Oh well, part of the fun of using GPS I guess. :)"
4,"""something to live by""",C un des meilleurs disks ke jé écouté. Les chansons sont vramnt des bons leon de la vie. Mon favori c vie meilleure.
1,the sellers were excellent,"The product arrived in record time. Actually the product did what it was supposed to, but it made my hair smell awful, and that lasted until I washed my hair again, in a couple of days. It smelled like dirty hair when it was still wet from washing and never diffused. a shame, because it styled my hair very well, however I'm 75 and don't wash my hair everyday---too drying, but this lotion smelled as if my hair hadn't been washed for a year. Just bad. Not the sellers fault.I realized I don't comment when things are perfect, just when purchases are disappointing, I'm not usually a negative person, I just hate spending money on things I don't see, and when they come I'm sorry I bought them"
2,Not too impressive,"Taboo really doesn't have much to offer than a couple of fortune-telling games, such as tarot or telling you your lucky numbers. It's not a game you want to play constantly or for a long time because of the fact that it offers so little. And video games cannot make accurate predictions or prophecies. You're better off with a real deck of cards or a Ouija board."
3,Not as thin as I would have liked,"OK, I heard this is good for dry skin, I have tried it on certain places on my face that is very dry due to treatment for sun damage. It does soften the skin but it kind of hard to blend it in without pulling the skin more than I like to. Mixing it with an almond oil helps liquify it. It's OK"
2,"Sticky , heavy not for hair use",So I heard its great for hair growth well not this kind... So sticky had to wash my hair over three times to remove it
4,Lasts and still going strong...,I ordered this bottle several months ago and it's still lasting me. I use it for my hair and sometimes my skin. Good product.
2,Cracked Bottle,"I was diappointed to open the box and have castor oil all over the box, especially since I had another item in the box. The bottle appears to be cracked. I am not sure if it works for what my doctor recommended it for bc I am horrible about using it. I don't know if it's supposed to be vicous but it is. It has no significant smell. I should have gotten a smaller bottle. The price was good compared to some other places."
5,=),"My edges have been thinning a lot over the past year, and after doing research I learned that castor oil can help thicken your hair and grow back your edges. I've been using it two times a day for the past two weeks and I'm already seeing results! (I apply it to my edges and massage my scalp with it each time I apply it.)My hair has been a lot shinier and softer after washing it, my curls and waves have been popping a lot more, etc. Most importantly, my edges are already coming back in. I'm completely satisfied with the results this product has given me in such a short time and will continue to use it."
3,fast shipping,"Very fast shipping, thank you! I am very happy camper and I would buy from this seller again. I am happy with the seller but not the procuct. It really did not work for me. I had no choice but to throw it away. :("
2,"Disposable, lasts about a year. Cleans good.","I have had two of these units. Both have stopped working. The first one I took apart, and saline had destroyed the electronics. The second stopped working a month ago, probably for the same reason. While they work, they clean my lenses and I can wear them comfortably for 12+ hours."
1,Doesn't work!,"When I removed the lid, it didn't seem to do anything. It made the hissing sound, but the solution was very still. It didn't make any wave like other ultrasonic machines I've seen. I eventually bought LenSoClean, and LenSoclean seems to work a lot better."
1,"Good Idea, Poor Execution","This cleaner only operated two times before packing it in. It no longer hisses and the cleaning solution shows no sign of ultrasonic agitation.It's a shame. The idea of using ultrasound to clean contact lenses is, I think, a good one. But this device is not reliable, judging by my experience and that of a number of other reviewers.My unit is going back to Amazon for a refund. I might just try getting a replacement and see if that one holds up better. But not if I can find another brand.Either way, I'll report back later."
4,Donna,This is a true ultrasound and it works well. I tried to remove stubborn contact lenses stain after enzymatic soaking but was not very successful with the removal. It is good for minor stains.
2,So so,This product works great for cleaning My hard contact lenses. The problem is that I've been using it about 6 weeks and the flimsy basket cover is already broken.
3,Avoid JewelsMall!,"I bought Ultrasonic Contact Lens Cleaner at JewelsMall with $42.89. It was broken one when it arrived. Not only I need to pay the return postage about $12 (they told me to ship it with UPS) but also they refunded only $35.90. So they charged me with their postage fee. They also tried to charge 7% for the return restocking fees but, I told them this is ridiculous and they eventually agreed telling me that since it is defective, they won't charge it. Don't believe their ad saying ""30 days money back guarantee"". One can get refund only within 15 days. I won't buy any item from JewelsMall."
5,Better than anything Pavement ever recorded on Drag City.,"I first read about the B.S.#10 in Rolling Stone magazines' artist best picks from a few years ago. It was choosen by Beck in his personal top 5. Well I finally picked it up a few weeks ago and its amazing! Lo-fi brilliance at its best. Better than anything Pavement ever recorded for Drag City. If you like the early work of such bands like Sebadoh, Flaming lips, Beck or TFUL 282 you should pick this up. plus its a real value at nearly 72 minutes long."
1,Caused Blue Screen of Death on Windows XP,"After I installed this software, my Windows XP system shut down with the dreaded ""blue screen of death"". I'm still trying to return my system to its former useable state! Beware!"
5,"easy read, you'll like this one","Sam's writing style makes this a great read for sports fans and non-sports fans alike. I had a vague recollection of Bill Campbell from my childhood in the Philly suburbs, but this read brought back great memories that were dormant. The writer lets his subject be the star in this book, a highly recommended read that'll keep the pages turning!"
5,Love Phila,Both my husband and I have been incredible Phila Fans forever. Can't tell you how great it was to read Bill Campbell's information.
2,a disappointment,"Considering the fact that Bill Campbell has been the voice of Philadelphia sports for about 50 years I was disapppointed by this book. I expected to have much more in Campbell's own words about his impressions of the sporting personalities and events that he was privileged to know and participate in respectively. Since he was probably Van Brocklin's closest friend in the Philadelphia area, he would be in a position to share some of the secrets of this enigmatic personality. If you compare this book to Bob Gordon's book on the 1960 Eagles it is not even close. Gordon tells a cohesive story without stepping on the players words. This book is 95% Carchidi and 5% Campbell or more correctly Campbell's family. Problem is, Campbell, not Carchidi, had the experiences and relationships. The story should have come from him.--Save your money."
3,Didn't do too good in Central Florida,"I didn't have much success with Barenbrug Perennial Ryegrass seed in Central Florida. Our area (Hernando Co.) is known for being difficult to grow anything in the sandy ground - and I can't blame the seeds for not sprouting. However, I planted some seeds in the large planters and two months later the tallest blades are no more than 4 inches tall - although these have good growing conditions and regular watering."
5,Excellent- kick butt!,"I love this MP3! It's of a real run- I love the boots hitting the ground. How can you possibly fall out with these guys singing as they do? I'm a 47 year old female, been an office chair muffin for 3 years! back started hurting AGAIN, UGH! walking? too boring, running? can't/won't/don't like or so I thought! In just 2 weeks I'm running 3.5 to this cadence MP3- GO AIRBORNE!!! I listened to other samples- don't like the ""fake"" percussion, won't buy those, - gotta have a real run! (and you can understand the words :) I now look forward to my runs."
3,Good collection of articles on Shareholder Value,"Although the structure is very similar to THE REVOLUTION IN CORPORATE FINANCE, Rutterford's book includes only articles on adding shareholder value. Among the contributers are well known academics like F. Black, R.M. Stulz, or R.S. Kaplan. All in all, a good supplementary book to other corporate finance sources."
5,A smoldering set...,"For the initiate and the long-time fan, this collection is a career spanning glimpse at Baker's most brilliant performances. Trumpet and voice are both sultry, sad, and ""suspended in air like a curl of cigarette smoke"" (from the liner notes - which are an excellent companion to the music). This is pure soul, long and slow, melancholy and deep. The sound is clean but not overly so. The original grain comes through without the pops and clicks. From jazzman to junkie, this is the musical journey of Chet Baker on one carefully crafted cd."
4,Great Album,"Very good album, full of songs that only need to be rediscovered. Classics that you though you had forgotten but still recognize instantly. Simple songs with timeless melodies."
5,Oldies but goodies,Nice song selections. The first album was very good. This second compilation didn't fail to impress.All songs by original artistes. Just what I like to keep good memories!
4,nice mix,If you've seen this movie and/or are into the manchester music scene or any kind of retro/punk/new wave this is a great cd for you. Most of the best songs and artists featured in this movie are present on this cd. It is worth mentioning that 'A Certain Ratio' is conspicuously absent after being featured and mentioned repeatedly in the film. I would've liked to have heard 1 or 2 tracks by ACR here.Recommended!
1,4/18 of Madchester,"I saw the movie a few years back, enjoyed it, and recently bought the sound track.... What a disappointment! As I listened to the sound track, I realized yet again that Joy Division WAS Madchester and all the other tracks (with the possible exception of the New Order tracks) are just filler. The no-name bands are awful. Without Joy Division there would be no 24 Hour Party People worth remembering. So I wish I had bought a Joy Division album instead of this."
3,Bad recording quality...,"For the music it has ... 5 stars.For the quality the tracks has been recordered .... 1 stars.For this kind of music, quality sound should be excellent, almost. This CD has a bad remastering quality."
3,A really nice bowl,"I got this for Christmas and was thrilled. I've wanted a spinner for years and it was pink. The bowl is great! Nice size and the lid can be used after the spinner is removed (there is a rubber stopper that comes with it). However, it doesnt dry things as well as other spinners."
1,regret this purchase,i give 1 star because it is pretty. it doesnt dry anything and is awkward to use. my old cheapo spinner did a good job although it was very small. i chose this one for its size and kitchen aid brand. so far i have not been too happy with kitchen aid except for my wonderful stand mixer. wish my grandson hadnt broken my old spinner
5,Just wonderful to clean and dry salad etc,I love the product. It performs well in drying my salads and also performs double duty as a pretty pink salad serving bowl.
3,Not bad but not great either,"We got this essentially to match the rest of the pink appliance and accessories in our kitchen. It does what it is supposed to, but I can see how it could be much better. Despite being maid by Kitchenaid, it doesn't seem as well made as I would have expected. Also I have issues with the handle you push down to make it spin. When trying to spin it, it locks at the bottom and you have to press the button to release it again. Also when you leave it locked while it slows down it tends pop back up by itself. All in all, this gets the job done, but I think there are much better ones available (just not in pink:( )Update: After a few months of moderate use the bowl shattered and the mechanism you push down on stripped out as well. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone."
3,"""Westin 33-0880 Bull Bar",The instulation was fairly simple except for the cutting of the plastic air-dam under the bumper. There was no instructions for aligning or cutting through the plastic. They recomended removal but did not show how to remove the air-dam. It looks good on the truck and seems to be of good quality.
1,Difficult,"I never liked this game, it was SO difficult, it took me several hours just to resque RD-D2, then getting killed by some character within a minute. The game is also really ugly."
1,Worthless for any heavy shop/wet use,"Replaced a 10 year old craftsman wet/dry shop Vac with this pile , and it has MAYBE got 25% of the suction power of my old Vac. I'd love to say it sucked but it sure does not. If you plan on using this for auto or marine use I would say look elsewhere."
2,Porter-Cable 7812 10-Gallon Vacuum,"After about 3 years of occasional use (maybe once a month), the automatic cut-off for the wet vac function stopped working. Now when vacuuming water off a floor the vacuum doesn't stop even when full. Very irritating. Hose size is non-standard, and your accessories form other vacuums will not fit. The Porter Cable adapter that allows use of standard vacuum hoses, fittings etc. is flimsy and breaks. I've gone through two so far. Bags and accessories are expensive, hose is narrow and the suction is weak. I would not buy this vacuum again."
4,"lots of good features, lacks some suction.","Overall i like it, it is nice for working indoors and great for hooking up to power saws and collecting dust i really like that when you turn the saw on the vacuum automatically comes on. I was a little disappointed with the strength of the vacuum. I use mine for installing hardwood and laminate floors, and it is pretty good at reducing the dust down, with this vac i could cut inside and have minimal dust. Im not a big fan of the bags, infact i dont use them, and the vac works just fine. All in all its a good shopvac, and its pretty quiet in comparison to many other models i have seen around the jobsite. just seems to lack some suction. also not sure where one could find attachments, since they aren't included."
3,good product,purchased the vac and sander.... the only problem with them is that you have to beware of the bag in the vac breaking which allows all the sheet rock dust to go all over. Therefore it made far more dust then I thought ..... I put 3 bags in it and everyone got a hole in it.
5,Porter-Cable 10 Gallon Vacuum Review,I have owned this vacuum for over two years and it still runs good. It is quieter than most and has enough power for whatever task I've thrown at it. It is exceptional for capturing drywall dust and sawdust with the Shop-Vac fine dust bags which hold more than the Porter-Cable bags and keep the filter clean. I use a Mr. Nozzle hose to prevent clogs. Overall a great vacuum.
5,Porter Cable Vacuum,"While this vacuum is typically used to support drywall sanding and other dust producing tools, this is the only vacuum my wife will allow in our house. She loves the fact that the exhaust is filtered and dust does not come back into her freshly cleaned house."
4,saves my lungs,"i own my own woodshop so i needed a good dust extractor,shop vacs just dont cut it,this one works as described sucks all the dust whether i am useing it for a RO or Belt sander. cant hear it over the sanders."
2,Just not very happy with it,"I bought this vacuum over a year ago because I wanted a quiet, powerful vacuum and was willing to pay more than the price of the various ones available at Lowes, etc. Well, it is relatively quiet, but my household vacuum has better suction. Additionally, the lack of standard types of hose end fittings is disappointing, and there's no place to conveniently wind either the power cord or the very long hose."
3,two years old and not going so strong,"It worked well for a year, then the tool-activated switch got finicky; then at the two-year mark, both switches went out completely. At this price, and at the repair price of the complicated switch mechanism, this effectively has a two-year life span. Would I buy it again? Probably not."
4,An almost perfect compilation!,"Great to hear all these tracks again now that they've been fully remastered. The sound is much improved but, I only wish they had included the tracks from their very first single ""Mutant Moments"".I'm not a big fan of remixes of old records.But, an exception must be made for the (Electronic Drum & Bass-styled) 2XS remix of ""Tainted Love"". Which somehow manages to update but, not spoil the original magic. Whereas Marilyn Manson's take on the song is slow. This version is faster than the original! I read in a Dave Ball interview that they personally asked them to remix this and loved the results. Always nice to know whether the artist approves i think. Buy without doubt."
4,It's good,"I love Marc Almond's music, and I mistakenly bought this but meant to get ""Non Stop Erotic Cabaret"". If you don't have either one, I'd recommend Non stop Erotic Cabaret over this one, but a few of those are on this one too."
4,How can it be the very best without FRUSTRATION ?,"How can it be ""the very best of"" without FRUSTRATION? It's the first song on Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret for a reason. It's a fantastic track, and it should be on this CD."
3,My two favorite Soft Cell songs - It's A Mugs Game and Sex Dwarf,I despised Tainted Love but always loved Mug's Game and Sex Dwarf so for me it's worth the price of admission.
3,Tainted Love fades out. Why? Then Where Did Our Love Go.,"This is really a good cd but I'm disappointed that tainted love and where did our love go are not mixed together as played on the radio. It may seam like a small complaint to some, but that was my main reason for buying this cd."
3,Someone Had A Great Idea,The new mix of Tainted Love has the electronic drum sound of modern deejay mixes. It then seamlessly becomes Where Did Our Love Go which has the same key and tempo as Tainted Love.
2,"Too simple for mathematicians, too complex for laypersons",The level of mathematical maturity in the book is not well thought out. The book is simplistic to anyone with mathematical exposure to probability models but too complex for the non-mathematician to follow.
2,I used to love this game as a kid.,"When I was a kid I loved this game but now I have no idea why. The perspective is horrible and the water rage part makes no sense. I am not sure what the point is of this game, and why we are looking past the game from the sidelines. It is hard to tell where things are spacially. If you figure out how to play the water rage part please let me know!"
5,What A Great Surf And Skate Title,"I just love playing this game yes it's simple, but that it's charm and funness of it going from skating to surf it's quite addicting and fun way to burn some time up.T & C Surf Designs: Wood & Water Rage is excellent title in it's day this was quite popular title sold of the old nes games including mario brothers trilogy of games and donkey kong and few others.Highly Recommended Title For Fun Play.P.S. I Miss The T&C; T-shirts too they were fun to wear."
2,Too much clip art not relevent or just filler on disc.,too much unusable clip art.Not enough nature or transportation art.
1,Very Disappointed - there are much better other guides,"We just returned from Costa Rica where we used this book. We were disappointed at the incorrect and misleading comments the author makes throughout the book. For example, the author opens the description of Monteverde by describing the drive as ""through deforested, eroded pastures."" I wonder where the author gets her information as the climate, soils, and environment at Monteverde is what creates the special cloud forest. This same enviroment does not exist at the lower enviroment. The route up does pass through small communities and family farms. The author demonstrates her lack of botany or plant ecology background.In addition to inaccurate description of the environment, we found the information in the book dated. We preferred to use the lonely planet and frommers guides."
4,Ladies Toyo Cowboy Hat - Black W35S14C,"The Ladies Toyo Cowboy Hat - Black W35S14C is a hat I'd recommend for ""yoinger ladies"" 14 years old through 25 years old. The hat arrived on time and as promised."
2,Womens? Too small!,This hat actually fits my 8 year old daughter better than me. I bought it for a boudoir shoot and the photographer had to break out her own cowboy hat for us to use after we figured out this hat is just too small!
1,bo,"forget it unless you are an early 20-something slacker/loser/delayed- adolescent, and just want a random act to hurt someone who hurt you.even then, it wouldn't be that funny."
5,Excellent!,"Funny, crude and full of laugh-out-loud moments......Originally I thought it would be a real guys book...But after the first few page's I fell instep with the story and couldn't put it down.Yes, it's crude, but its very honest too. I found it didnt take long to like the main charater Lenny. Lenny has a heart of gold and a mouth he really shouldnt kiss his Mother with. But even the crudness of who Lenny and his friends are make it all the funnier.Funniest revenge story you'll ever read."
5,Oustanding!,"This is the best book I've read in a long, long time! I laughed out loud so many times, my wife thought I was crazy! No matter what your profession or income, everyone has wanted to ""stick it to the man"" at least a few times throughout their life. This book thrives on that desire - Pushing it to limits you couldn't possibly imagine. As a child of the 80's in a town very much like Lenny's, I could relate to almost every aspect of this book. Funny, funny, funny...."
3,Coffee was really good until the batches got bitter-tasting,"My wife and I ordered this coffee several times until July 2011 when the batches started tasting bitter. We really enjoy dark roasts with strong, robust flavors in the morning, so when I saw this coffee, we decided to try it out. Some initial bags were quite good but got somewhat bitter as new bags were delivered monthly. We stopped delivery after a really bitter batch. We now drink an expresso roast from Costco/Kirkland/Starbucks. Three stars for good initial bags, but got inconsistant roasts down the line later."
3,Switching back to French Roast,"I read the review on this and decided to try it instead of the French roast that I have been buying, but found the flavor not as robust as I would like. That said, I have cancelled my subscribe and save on this Peruvian Dark and moved back to Cafe Altura Organic French Roast."
1,very bitter,I absolutely love Cafe Altura Columbian Dark. I buy about 8 pounds a month. I saw the Peruvian and decided to try it. I thought that it was awful. I made one pot and will probably throw the rest of it away.
3,Not That Dark,"Was hoping for a darker, richer roast. Ground it fine, coarse, brewed it with 3 kinds of water and still couldn't get it strong enough. Very smooth and drinkable (hence the 3 stars); just not the dark coffee I'm looking for. My bag did weigh in at a full 32 oz (32.5 with the package.)"
5,Our Favorite,"We get a shipment of this regularly, because we MUST be well-stocked at all times.It has a deep, rich flavor with complex notes. The acidity is low, and while the beans are oily, it's in just the right way.I have yet to find a burnt bean, as well! You can tell there is some love and care that goes into the roasting of these beans.We will buy these beans for as long as they continue roasting them!"
5,"Strong, flavorful, healthy, great","Good for the environment (dio-dynamic shade-grown)Good for the farmer (fair trade)Good for you (delicious, fresh, strong, flavorful)What's not to like?!"
1,Horrible flavor,"I decided to try this coffee despite some of the bad reviews. I LOVE Cafe Altura's French Roast. It is wonderfully rich and smooth and so good that I crave it. This Peruvian Dark smells wonderful but tasted like it had been sitting on the warmer for an hour or two. To me it tasted burnt. It was bad enough it made me feel sick to my stomach and couldn't drink more than 1/2 cup. Maybe if you use a flavored creamer it would be ok, but I don't like cream in my coffee. Altura makes wonderful coffee as long as you pick the right flavor. This wasn't the flavor for me."
5,Great Coffee,"Love this coffee. It's the whole one I drink. I always take it with my on trips, because I never can find good coffee."
4,Very good java,"This is a good, well rounded java that has a nice smoothness. The flavor is okay, but not really distinctive. I would buy it again, especially to mix with a medium roast, which is what I am doing now."
2,Touching Evil,"This book does not appear to be the best of Kay Hooper'sI have been reading Ms. Hooper since the early 80's. Afterreading this book I feel cheated.Ms. Hooper can typically capture my attention in the first paragraph and keep it until the conclusion. Unfortunately,this was not the case. I want to know more.There were two characters mentioned but not fully developed. I ended this book with several questions left hanging. They were:What happens to Beau? Who in the world is Galen? Finally, why mention them? They seemed to clutter the story line and not enhance it.Sorry, Ms. Hooper, I will continue to buy your books, but I hope the next one is better."
1,Gruesome to the max,This book should come with a warning: do not buy this book if you have a weak stomach. Graphic descriptions of mutalated women and in one case a 6 month old fetus is not my idea of good writing. You can have good writing without ratching up the gore factor. I will not buy a book from this author again.
3,Spellbinding But Could Have Been Better,"'Touching Evil' was a bit of an odd read for me. I read it in one sitting because I just couldn't put it down once I started it, yet when I was finished I felt a let-down. On the one hand, the plot was interesting and I enjoyed the characters. On the other hand, there seemed to be no real meat to the plot, no real action, no enthralling descriptions; and the characterizations were very shallow, not fleshed out. It was as if the author just skimmed the top of both. What could have been a very good book turned out to be just mediocre. The ending was a bit abrupt; for a mystery, which should have you thinking and guessing along with the storyline, the finale left something to be desired. I enjoy Kay Hooper's books and will continue reading them, but this was not one of her best."
4,Kept my attention throughout the book.,Very exciting book. It was tough to put it down. Every turn of the page kept you wanting more.
4,Suspense that borders on creepy,"Beyond not being able to put it down without finishing. After the rest of my family went upstairs to bed, I actually had to go upstairs too, as every noise in the house or outside freaked me out - but I couldn't stop reading."
3,Intense ...,"Kay Hooper has been writing stories do Psychic Power for some time, in this particular story, Maggie Barnes is a young psychic who has the ability to connect with victims of crime so deeply that she sees what they see, but can also experience their terror. Additionally, she is able to pick up on vibes left behind by the criminals at the scene.In conjunction with a team of FBI Psychic Investigators, she follows a ruthless killer into the heart of a trap that he set, not certain until the end whether her sure knowledge was planted or her own intuition.I do suggest that you read some other Hooper novels before reading this one or you will likely find it confusing."
2,too many psychics.. everyone is one!!,"maggie is a police sketch artist, and a very good one.. she draws people out of their misery and is able to draw a clear picture of the perp.This books started off good, but then got too many weird elements and everyone turns out to have some kind of gift...it dragged on and the ending is kind of anticlimatic..Was not thrilled with this one..."
2,A little too much paranormal for me,"This is my first Kay Hooper book and it would have been my last had I not already bought the other two books in the ""Evil"" triology. The brief storyline overview on the back cover of ""Touching Evil"" hints that there is a paranormal aspect to the book but seems to down play it. There is so much paranormal activity in the book that the story becomes unbelievable. Having said that, I do like Hooper's writing style, so I'll finish the other two books and see if she can win me over."
5,another great series,great book-i love kay hoopers books .this book is on the dark side-but it was a great book.maggie was a great character and yhou really feel for her and you do all characters in kay hoopers books.
1,Horrid waste of time,"This was a very long read and when things did happen, they were not handled properly by the author.The main character is not even likable and the whole thing has a very stupid ending.Major dissapointment, I will never read anything by Hooper again! In fact when I see her books I cringe."
4,This is a good one...,"This was the first of her books that I have read and I will definitely by looking into the rest of her work. I really enjoyed this book. It had a couple of places that I thought could have been worked more and some less, but overall it was a good read. It's one of those books that you anticipate getting to read more and thinking about during the day."
2,Not Her Best,"I have read almost everything Kay Hooper has written, and this latest book is definitely not her best. Fans of her romantic suspense should be warned that this is NOT a romance, and the violence is extreme and graphic. If you have enjoyed her other books, especially the funny ones, don't expect the same type of story here! This one is very dark."
4,Inside the mind of Evil,"I really enjoyed the latest of the ""Evil"" books. I don't have a lot of time to sit down and write an outline of characters and events when I read a book. Ms Hooper writes books that are easy to read yet have graphic sceenes to help you visualize the events as they occur. Thanks and I can't wait for her next book!"
2,DIssapointing,"My boyfriends mother suggested I read this book and gave me her personal copy. It was so awful Imwondering if she secretly doesnt like me!Long and boring, like others said, I couldnt figure out for the life of me who was who, way to many characters who pop in and out and are not impressive when they are finally speaking.Don't waste your time, Im better off reading good ole Agatha Christie than this mothern mayhem."
1,Big Mistake,"This book is about a crime series that can only be solved by Maggie, a detective with paranormal abilities, and a couple of FBI agents focusing on the paranormal. Almost all of the information about the case is obtained by Maggie walking over crime scenes and by talking to witnesses and absorbing the remaining ""energy"" created the crime itself.Unless you are psychic yourself, the book gives no clues on the development of the story. It's even pointless to think about this since the author does not hesitate to explain that this case can only be solved by a medium.To a large extent it seems that the author focuses more on convincing the reader in the existence of the paranomal than on the plot itself. I read the whole book only because I was curious whether I missed something. What a mistake."
2,Definitely not as good as the Shadows series,"Maybe it was because her Shadow books were unique, but they were so much better than Touching Evil. I found that I really had to force myself to read it. There wasn't the ""thrilling, have to read, leave me alone, can't put it down"" draw with this book as there had been with her first three books. I was very disappointed in this one and ended up just skimming to see who the killer was. Needless to say it is the first Kay Hooper book that has ever ended up in the bag to go to the book exchange. I hope her next one is better, though I might just get it from the book exchange instead of buying it new."
5,Cannot put it down,Enjoyed it to the very last page. Some twists I WAS SURE i COULD SEE COMING ONLY TO BE SUPRISED
3,A rather tepid suspense,"I'm a big fan of Kay Hooper, and her books always make for a good read on a rainy afternoon. ""Touching Evil,"" however, was rather overblown in the ""psychic"" department - there were enough psychics in this book to float a battleship, and I completely and totally agree with the other reviewers who found the never-ending parade of characters to be a needless distraction. I would have liked to see more chemistry between Maggie, the protagonist, and John; however, their romance appeared throughout the book almost as though it were an afterthought. There wasn't any connection between these two, other than a brief sexual encounter which was very quickly elevated to ""true love"" by the last few pages of the book. ""Touching Evil"" wasn't the worst suspense book I've read, but I do believe that Hooper can do much better - in fact I know she can, I've read her ""Shadows"" series."
5,What A Voice!,"I saw this young lady in ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" on Broadway and, quite frankly, her voice just knocked me out. At intermission, I went to the lobby and bought this CD sight unseen. I have enjoyed it and played it so much, that my two daughters, who returned to N.Y. and saw ""Pimpernel"" again, waited for her outside the theatre and got her to autograph it. ""Fly Me to the Moon"", ""Love is Good"", ""All My Tomorrows"" and the beautiful ""Storybook"", from ""Pimpernel"" - there isn't a bad song in the album. I firmly believe that if I play this album with the window open, birds would come to our sill looking to mate. Enjoy."
4,For NON-Fluoride Toothpaste Users....All Natural..Great Tasting,"Tom's Of Maine has some great tasting and multi benefit toothpaste. I like that all the ingredients come from nature. This one(antiplaque) with fennel, propolis and myrrh is for non-fluoride users. The ingredients(calcium carbonate, water, glycerin,xylitol, carrageenan, sodium lauryl sulfate, fennel oils, naatural flavors, myrrha and propolis), work well to prevent plaque build up and leave your mouth feeling clean and fresh. Although with this one inparticular, the freshness didnt seem to last quite as long as other flavors from Tom's, and I brushed an extra time between meals.This toothpaste uses only a mild abrasive(the calcium carbonate), and the taste is great. The best way I can think to describe the taste is like a purple spice drop. I rotate this one with Tom's 'anticavity' with baking soda and fluoride.A fresh, tasty, and all natural way to take good care of your teeth. Works for me.Have a happy and healthy New Year.....Laurie"
5,Information Economics,"I was happy when I read Information Economic by Marilyn M. Parker. I will be happy if I can discuss Information Economics with Mr. Marilyn M. Parker. Althaugh, I get new knowledge form the book, but I want to learn Information Economic more. Because I was very intersted to the topics. Thank"
4,The Terminator: NES,"this is an extremely difficult game. no known game genie codes exist, so you just have to keep re-starting again and again. It is rare, and I still plan on beating it"
5,"Great Quality, Great Extras","All three of the films are awesome, so I won't write a review about them. The quality of the films are all superb, another triumph from Criterion. The extras are really good. I particularly loved the interviews with Andrzej Wajda speaking about his hardships and beginnings. Plus, the price $60 is really fair. $20 a film is a good price, especially for Criterion's usually expensive ways."
3,Super Off Road for NES,"Old game, classic, interesting to play for those that are not big into the newer gaming systems"
1,Never again...,Awful product. Did not get it on time. Paint was messed up on the runes. If I would have known that they were going to be made that way I would have went to walmart to get the stuff to make my own. Wish it came with directions on how to burn loose incense. Not happy with the product or service at all but to much of a pain to send it all back.
5,Very Professional Company,"Lady Dark Raven has been very professional. I am very glad to have purchased this item from her company. She really believes in customer service. This item arrived on time. I will be purchasing more from her company.Sincerely,Donald Patrick Howell"
5,A great version of Jeopardy!,"...The NES version of ""Super Jeopardy!"" plays just like the TV version, but you control one player, and in order to defeat the game, you must win one game in the first round (just like the TV show, the first round has 4 players [1 human player vs 3 computer players, or 2 human players vs 2 comp. playes]), one game in the quarerfinals, one game in the semifinals, and one game in the finals. You are given a password after you defeat a round.Graphics for this version of the hit game show were remarkable, but the sound effects in this game were sweet. This was one of a select few of 8-bit NES games which had synthesized speech built into the game...get it. It's fun!"
4,Great vacuum,"I just wish, for $330 they included a couple of attachements. It's not that I'm going to vacuum my living room, but just the 2 nozzles from the accessory kit to pick up some saw dust or something after I make a mess.They make an accessory kit for another $60. A Brush, a wand and a wide attachement, plus more hose and extensions. $390 total.I use it with my router, sander and chop saw. Not a lot of noise and great suction. Obviously what it was designed for, wandless tool dust collection.Heavy to lug up stairs so I try to keep in in the shop.Nice long cord and hose. a Very nice vacuum overall."
2,Don't plan on sweeping your floor any time soon,"Seems like an ok unit suctionwise--I just got it--but make sure you notice before you order: All the stuff you need to actually sweep anything up is SOLD SEPARATELY. 65 more bucks and another wait or else a trip to the local dealership. Looks like I will clean the floor of my shop this weekend just by shuffling the hose around on it. Also, I will need to jury-rig or buy yet more accessories to get it able to vacuum sawdust from my non Porter-Cable miter saw. The port and hose sizes are way different. Would it have hurt P-C to include a few cheap plastic adapters so that people with other tool brands could use the thing with 'em?"
4,so aggro....,"This dvd was given to me by my on again off again elderly sugar daddy in an attempt to reckindle the flame of our once simmering romance that had dwindled to a pathetic flicker. We are both huge icp fans and i have been a juggalo since graduating from beauty school and opening my own wreath boutique in the richmond bart station. I was somewhat disappointed that none of the insane clowns made an appearnace in the video, but I was delighted that they managed to maintain such a balls out homo erotic overtone to the film. I suppose I should tell all you juggalos out there that if you are stuck in a dead end relatioship with a jaded old queer who hasn't been to neiman marcus since three's company went off the air, this is the only way to spice up your romantic life. I truly think that the 78 minutes of magic contained in this dvd will allow you to feel like freddie mercury in a pair of leather pants."
4,Enterprise by Dennis McCarthy,I was so glad to find this cd because the theme to the show is one of my hubands favorite songs and we couldn't find it anywhere.
4,Starting Off On The Right Foot!,"Although some of the music, like Archer's Theme, could have been expanded and featured more prominently, most of the music on Enterprise is great! McCarthy always pours his heart into whatever he writes. I'm sure we'll be hearing more from him, and even better music from the hope of the future, the hope of all mankind: Enterprise"
5,Enterprise CD,"Purchased as a gift for a family member. Gift was well liked and quality was good. Good gift idea for any ""Trekie"" fan."
2,Please don't make me listen to the theme song again!,I grew up with Star Trek. I have bought every Star Trek CD ever put out. The theme song to Enterprise is horrible. I would rather listen to the death throws of a cat then to the theme song to Enterprise.Whatever you do not listen to the theme song. It will scar you for life!
2,"CD player plays CD, computer does not",The computer does not play the music for some reason. But my CD player does.
5,Husband Loves It!,"My husband loves Russell Watson's, ""Where My Heart Will Take Me"" so I got this for him. After hearing it, I love the song, too, and can see why it is the theme song for the show - it certainly fits. My husband likes all the music on this CD, but especially Watson's version of the song."
3,Enterprise,"The music of Star Trek is amazing, and Enterprise is no exception. The only thing I hate about Enterprise is the theme song. It does not go with Star Trek well. The rest of the music is the reason this CD is worth buying."
2,More bland filler music,"No disrespect to Composer Dennis McCarthy...it's not his fault. But Berman and the other powers that be don't like good music, so for years now they have enforced this state of ""white noise"", blandness, and sameness on their shows. It's gotten to the point where there is no difference who the composer is on any given episode.Great music from the older ST:TNG shows by Ron Jones sits rotting away on a shelf while wallpaper like this gets released? C'mon! McCarthy is a good composer, but he's gotten so used to these harsh standards being imposed against him...I really wonder if he knows how to cut loose anymore.If you've bought one album of newer era Star Trek TV music, then you've bought them all."
4,Great story and well told,"You should read this book if you are at all interested in ice ages, geology, history of science, climate change, or just a good story. It's a quick but thorough telling of the discovery of the ice ages and how their nature and origin have been slowly uncovered over the following 150 years (and still going!). No other book does so much in such a short space on the subject. One of the authors was personally involved in the story, so he has insider authority. Unfortunately, this probably accounts for the slower pace of the last few chapters, where events close to him are described in much greater detail. And even though the book is only 15 years old the last chapter (on a future ice age and the potential for global warming) seems outdated. Still, the book is well worth a quick read."
5,"Zat You, Santa Claus?",Just what I was looking for as a break from the same old carols and pop that floats out at Christmas time!
3,Only OK...,"So much of this CD is so dispensable. Much sounds like it could have come from any urban city, except New Orleans!Uninspired, dull tunes, too many of them.The two from New Birth, you're looking for toe tapping music, but it's just so-so.A few have a New Orleans feel, but will they stay with you? I say no. You won't look forward to playing them next year.Now the two tunes from Tousaint are just fine, bring on an entire CD from him.3 stars for my respect for Tousaint and love for the city. 2 stars for most of the music."
3,LOST IT,I don't know. Some groups like The Dramatics and The Delphonics need to give it up. They can't sustain that magic that was once there. This was a disappointment.
1,This game SUCKS,This is just a boring game you walk around with nothing to shoot and then all of a sudden your flashing because something is attacking and the view your in you cant see what it is. DON'T buy this game
1,Wrong item,its was not for xbox it was for ps2 they send me the wrong game for the wrong consul it sucks
2,The Author was my professor,"I had the pleasure (not) of having Thomas Sorrell for organic chemistry at UNC and this book is not very good. He didn't even refer to it that often. He would provide notes that were clearer than the book and I personally think they should be included in a new edition. The other classes don't use this book; he's the only one who uses, I guess to stroke his ego. I think if you pay attention in your lecture class, you could do well without this book."
5,Love it!,"I love rags, pipe organs and Tom Hazleton (RIP). What else needs to be said?I'm listening right now...I have at least 10 of Tom's CDs. This is one of my favorites."
5,Oustanding on Spiritual Level,"A truly ground breaking series ahead of its time.The series is one of the most spiritual TV shows I have even seen.Sounds strange, underlying all action sequences are the lessons of dignity, humility and honor that jack represents.For example, we have watched the episode Jack vs. Mad Jack and every time we have profound lessons in it.I am looking forward to the next seasons releases in 2005."
5,The Future of American Animation,"Drawing its influences from classic science fiction and Japanese animation, Samurai Jack has set the standard for animated series in America. Equal care is given to creating engaging, complex story lines and superb visuals. The writing is brilliant.Unlike other cartoons, Samurai Jack is anything but predictable. Jack's journey into the distant future from his native ancient Japan is heart-wrenching, hilarious and thrilling. Mako (who played the wizard in Conan the Barbarian) is wonderfully outrageous as the voice of Aku -- the ""Shogun of Sorrow"" who is Jack's nemesis. Nerds such as myself will appreciate references ranging from Star Wars, to Conan to Shogun Assassin."
3,Incomplete,"I pre-ordered Jack Season 1 from Amazon.com and got it today. I opened it looking forward to watch my (everyone's) favorite episode, XIV Jack Jump Good. It's not here! The 2 DVDs contain 12 episodes, 4 of which are already on the first Jack DVD. The last episode is XIII Aku's Fairy Tales.Hopefully Season 2 will come out soon, and contain the episodes that aired in the winter of 2002."
2,ugh..,"This show is so bad. I mean ...the drawings are terrible the plot is absurd. How something like this gets on the air is uncomprehensible. I notice alot of people here bash down the negative reviews on this, obviously im guessing because they are fans. I've seen web-animations that are better than this...for one example ""Ninjai"" and that show is created with less people and creates more emotion. With that said I gave this got two stars because I can remember about two episodes that actually came close to being good.. But if this was any attempt at something epic..they failed. Now vote me down... cause the truth hurts baby!"
5,Samurai Jack - Season 1,"We couldn't find this anywhere - we finally found it at Amazon where we can always find everything/anything. Expensive, but absolutely worth it. A total ""Wow""!"
5,Excellent series,This is an excellent series. It is unfortunate that Cartoon Network decided to let it drop. My 10 year old son enjoys all 4 volumes.
4,J. Mason,"Oh man, if you loved the original Tetris then you're gonna love this! It has the same addictive game play and the blocks have different patterns this time. It's much funner than a lot of those other Tetris remakes and spinoffs! A highly recommended title for your NES library."
3,It's ok...the orginal Tetris is still the best.,It's more like Dr. Mario with all the colors. I got it because I thought it more like the original Tetris with the ability to challenge. This game is just ok.
4,childhood favorite,"whether you should be lucky to acquire the original game booklet or not, the gameplay is fairly easy to figure after a few rounds: line up sets of 3+ blocks of the same color to destroy the ""bomb blocks"" that are flashing (and progress to the next level); or you can compete against a friend to see who's faster! I couldn't tell you how many hours I spent frivolously over this game when it was released back in the 90s. It's easy entertainment for age 8+ in my opinion"
4,Addictive,"If you enjoyed the old tetris, you should find this one just as fun. The rules of this game are different - it's no longer about clearing rows, but eliminating flashing blocks by matching colors, though the prices fall from the ceiling as they do in the old game. This game has enough differences from the old one to keep it interesting, but there's just enough original elements to keep a Tetris fan comfortable and having fun.The original Tetris was so simple in its rules that another game with the same thing would have just been repetitive. It's hard to say which game I liked more, Tetris or Tetris 2, but this game is solid. If puzzle games are your forte, try this out."
4,not a bad jam,maxk 10 does'nt belong on cash money still a good song can't believe dr. dre produced this still they took a bee gees hook and gangfsterfied it glad mack left cash money they're playing out anyway.
1,Nudity is NOT my thing!!,"This is an Agatha Christie title, and her books don't mention nudity of any kind! But this movie was quite the opposite! So for those of you who are disgusted with movies and nudity, don't buy this movie. I thought with Hayley Mills and George Sanders in it, that the movie would be good. I found it to be quite boring, silly, and stupid, plus the nudity turned me off. I won't watch this one again."
3,Endless night,not one of her best movies but it was ok. the acting was great but some of agatha christies other movies were better
3,"Endless Night - dated, but still a good watch","For lovers of Agatha Christie and Hayley Mills this is a ""should see"". Although very early seventies in look, especially the Gypsies Acre dream home, this film still satisfies with a twisted plot and good performances by Mills, Ekland and Bennett."
3,ENDLESS NIGHT OF HAYLEY'S ANOREXIA,"Although Hayley is still my favourite actress, this movie doesn't rank among her best ones. Moreover, I think that this is not just advisable for her fans, because her lean body resembles rather a skeleton of some school cabinet. I have rated it with three stars only because I still love her as Gillie of Tiger Bay. In any case, I think that this gloomy and depressive spectacle sharply contrasts with her previous comic roles (and it really doesn't suit her at all)."
1,defective,Product arrived on time but the video had deteriorated and did not play well. It was so inexpensive that it was not worth returning it.
1,Don't waste your money.,I could not believe the rave reviews of this movie. I bought the VHS several years ago. I love Hitchcock and Haley Mills. This movie is very bizarre rather than suspensful. I was very disappointed. Don't waste your money. Stick with the more well known Hitchcock movies with Jimmy Steward and Cary Grant.
1,Shameful,"what a waste of time and money, dame Agatha would be spinning in her grave for this cheap boring movie! Not even worth saying any more."
4,Nice cover,"It is not tiny, but it isn't huge either. I am about 5""4, and it does not cover my completely when I sleep under it. It is very soft, though, but not too fluffy. Maybe I just need to let it roll out and sit for a while since it's new. I can feel the down, but I think the microsuede is more of the ""theme"" of this cover than the down, because it's so smooth and soft to the touch it's very comfortable.I got it in sienna, and the color is a little darker than red, but very beautiful, and will work great on a beige or black living room couch. For the price of $9.99 I think it's worth it, but as a frugal shopper I'd like it to be a couple of dollars cheaper. I think I'll keep it, fluffy it up, and give it to my mom as a Christmas present (she naps on the couch quite often during the afternoons) and maybe buy another one for myself (though I'd do the olive/wasabi green instead)."
2,Beware.....feather down fill everywhere!,"I bought this throw (Sienna) a month ago for $9.99 and thought it was a good buy based on the reviews here on Amazon. Yes..the throw was quite small but very soft, just as pointed out in the reviews. However, I would like to warn all potential buyers that the feather down fill of this throw is a big nuisance. It started becoming loose and falling off through the throw fabric. Now my couch and living room is full of feathers that are so tiny....it is very diffiult to clean-up. Don't buy this and save yourself tons of energy in clean-ups."
3,You get what you pay for,"For $9, this does not qualify as a bad purchase for me.However, it has about $9 worth of material; it's very thin, and will only keep you warm to a certain extent. Additionally, since the throw is not able to cover your entire body, it's only useful while sitting since trying to use it while lying down will result in either cold feet/ankles or cold neck.It's unfortunate that you can't snuggle with the whole thing because both the interior and the exterior are very soft and welcoming!"
4,Great Value and Quality,"This is a great throw for the living room or a sitting room. The Sienna color is beautiful and once it has fluffed up after a bit out of the box, it is just wonderful. Warm and cozy lap blanket! This is a great gift and a spectacular price."
3,You get what you pay for,"Not the greatest quality. Within a week of use, the feather down fill started to come out. Also, it is way too short for an adult, yet nice size for a child."
3,"Serves its purpose, but not a steal of a deal","This is a nice microsuede throw, but dont think your getting a expensive thick throw. This throw leaks feathers daily with little use, so I am somewhat dissapointed by that, but overall it is a good product at a good price."
3,"Ok, but a little too short to sleep with on the couch","If you are looking for something to take an afternoon nap with this throw is small. It is definately nice to the touch (on one side, the other side is nylon), but your feet will stick out the bottom. I am not a tall person, either. Like it for watching TV to cover most of me. :)"
2,Microsued Down Throw,"Color does not fade, good lap throw for lightly cool days. Washes and dries easily but feathers to try to escape frequently."
4,Warm but too short!,"This blanket is amazingly light considering how warm it is once you're under it for a few minutes. The suede texture is nice and the reverse side is a soft fabric. Its a good lap blanket for sitting in the chair, but you really have to curl up if you want to take a nap with it- its too short. About 8 or 9 more inches in length would've earned it 5 stars."
2,Not as nice as I thought...,"I read all the reviews, sent one as a gift, then later sent one to myself. Wish I had sent one to myself first. It is soft, but in a soft plastic kind of way, like a shower curtain. It is not pleasant on bare skin and will feel clammy until it warms up. May even cause local perspiration. It is really flat when you get it. Looks empty. But it does respond to fluff drying and will puff up after time. It is not as luxurious as I had imagined it would be and I find myself grabbing the cheap flannel throw I got at Osco last week. It's warmer and softer.At the most this Microsuede Down Throw looks good on the back of a chair or sofa, and can be washed, but I would not buy it again."
5,Light and small,Not incredibly thick but warm. I use it for travel since I can roll it up very small and it doesnt take much space. Great inexpensive throw.
5,Love it,"I have this in the chestnut and in the sienna. One great thing is the color is as shown online, so there is no guess work. They are small but regular size for a blanket. On a queen bed they will cover the entire top portion without going over the edges, if that helps. When you get them they are de-fliffed so you can spray them with water to get damp and rum them through the dryer, they come out as fluffly and my goose down comforters and even though they look thin they are SO WARM! I'm really happy with the purchase."
3,"""Terragon"" means ""Khaki""","From the picture on the web, thought the color was a soft pink/peach but it's actually khaki. Wish Amazon would have simply described it as KHAKI so it's clear what the color is -- and then I would have given it 4 stars. (What IS ""terragon""? The spice is spelled differently.) Yes, it's the dimensions stated and not very poofy. The fabric is different on each side. I bought it as a gift for a little girl for her small bed, for in the car, for watching TV, etc. The material is stiff but looks like it might soften in the wash, and if a kid is using it, it will be washed frequently, so that's fine by me. Pink would have been cuter, but khaki's not so bad. If you want a big poofy down comforter, this is not what you are looking for. Would be a great modern version of the lap blanket for someone in a wheelchair."
3,Good but quite small.,"I am returning this item since it's too small. I dont think it would fit comfortably on a twin mattress either since it might be short in length. It is thin too, though I wouldn't doubt it will keep you warm."
3,disappointed,"I was disappointed on its size, its too small. I paid $10 and it's not worth it in my opinion. I would rather pay $15 more and get a microfiber cozy, soft blanket elsewhere, i bought one in the past and its well worth the money"
1,Very Suckie,It sucks if you have allergies there are little feather in the blanket that get out and go over everythig.
4,NICE FOR THE PRICE,"I purchased two of these throws (sienna and tarragon) sinse I have a leather couch that can be cold to sit on in the winter. They are soft, and well made with nice rich color, well worth the price I paid. They do the job while I am laying on my couch. They are however much smaller than a regular sized blanket (about the size of a childrens blanket). Overall nice throw for the price."
3,too small,This throw is constructed well. It is however very thin. I thought it would have much more fill than it does. It is also very small. Please read description closely before ordering. This item really isn't even large enough to be a lap throw.
1,No real info.,I was looking for technical data for the 06 4.6 which the preview said that it had. It didn't have more that just a few pages that even had anything for this engine let alone any data.
4,"A good guide to Performance upgrades for Mustangs, but...","This book is basically a republishing of articles from Muscle Mustangs & Fast Fords Magazine. But that is pretty much the only negative thing about it. If you haven't had a subscription, or you don't categorize and bookmark issues you do have, this is a good thing to have, especially, if like me, you haven't worked on a lot of cars. In introductions to chapters, it adds information that may have been left out of articles, which I found answered questions I had. It makes a good addition to the Haynes manual, which just covers stock items. I find it good reading even for those items I have no plan to upgrade. More pictures of the projects and references to chapters (or information on) other projects on the same vehicle would have made this a five star rating."
4,Excellent buy for the occasional chef,"I bought this for mother's day for my mother, a breast cancer survivor (6 years in 2007), despite the fact that my father does most of the cooking. About six months later, I visited them and made them a gourmet meal with these knives. I was shocked (pleasantly) when my dad said that their ceramic sharpener had broken, and they hadn't replaced it in over a year... so six months later, and these knives still were quite sharp. While they aren't the same quality of my normal wustoff knives, they certainly do the job ""in a pinch"". If you don't do a lot of cooking, but want to have something better than a box-store $10 butter knife, something along these lines will do perfectly."
5,Excellent Equipment for A Great Cause!!!!,"I love this set of Knives!!, Not only are they pink but they are very well balanced. Now although they could have been sharper for my tastes right out of the box(easily fixed) they were sharp enough to use right away, hard cheese, steaks, prep work, a snap!! And the block has a nice weight to it. The button on the block is stainless steel that is secured very well. I do want to say this about a previous review!!SO WHAT you have to register every thing you buy for the CFTC benefit, how are they gonna keep track of the items sold, I mean all you have to do is go to a web site, So please every one remember to keep your tags and boxes till you do. Think of every one you love that CAN be afflicted with this disease."
1,Not worth the money,"Eats batteries, always needs charging and doesn't hold a charge no matter what batteries are in it. I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,Pressure cooker or convection cooker?,"I am hard pressed to see how this can be called a pressure cooker when you cook with the vent open, then let it sit for a while. After the heat is no longer being applied, I don't see how there can be ""pressure"". It is a very nice looking piece of equipment, and poses no problems putting it together. Instructions are as minimal as they can be. I'll keep it using it, and it may have a place in my kitchen, but I don't think it will be the one I expected."
2,Unfortunate texture,"I have been working with chalk pastels for quite some time, and this paper is far from ideal for that particular medium. The weight is nice, but the surface has a texture that's difficult to lose. By which I mean, color won't penetrate evenly without being scrubbed in.Forgive the unorthodox lingo, but I would not recommend this paper for hard chalk pastels."
5,excellent read,i read down river first. such an intense and great yarn i ordered the first book hart wrote. excellent as well.
5,Awesome new writer,Best book I have read in a long time. Descriptions take you right there. The dynamics between family members is well conjoined. A very well told story...there had better be a sequel.
3,Similar to Grisham,"This book feels very similar to a couple of John Grisham's mysteries to me. Work is a lawyer in a Southern town with a big house - what do you know? So is Jake Brigance in ""A Time to Kill"". Work has difficult family relationships, and the protagonists in a number of Grisham's novels do as well. I agree with the comparisons both to Grisham and Scott Turow. I'll be interested to read John Hart's future mysteries."
4,A rare new Southern voice,"I read John Hart's latest (Iron House)before reading this book. I liked it so much that I went back to read his other books. He has an amazing ability to develop characters and plots. I am looking forward to the next one. If you like mysteries, you'll like John Hart."
1,What a drag!,"I almost didn't read this book to the finish. The self-centered wallowing in angst of the ""Work"" character, and the slimy phoniness of his wife literally made me queasy. Plus...the ending was so predictable, I had it figured out by the middle of the book. The only character I didn't ""get"" till the very end was Alex. Other than that, this book was so dreary and plodding I regretted even buying it to read at all. I'm the type who will stick out a story to the end pretty much no matter what, but this one almost wound up in the ""donations"" bag waaay before that."
5,THE thriller for the Summer of 2006,This book is awesome! From the moment I began reading John Hart had me hooked. A great thriller...makes John Grisham look like an amateur. I can not wait to see the movie!
4,A Very Good First Novel,"John Hart is a superb writer, a great novelist. This first book is good and definitely a must read. However, his other two novels are outstanding. I can't recommend this author enough, he deserves to reach the top of his profession."
2,Not a mystery!... and not good fiction.,I heard or read about this book on National Public Radio (NPR). This is the second book that NPR has recommended as a mystery that I think is definitely not. I found this book boring and plodding .... and not well written. The 2 star reviews are right on.
3,The King of Lies,"The first part of the book is slow but once I really got into it, I couldn't put it down. The author is heavy on description and slow on plot development."
5,King of Lies,I read John Hart's book The Last Child (amazing book) and got excited about his writing. I then ordered King of Lies and it didn't disappoint. Grisham-esque but better.
1,Unbelievably Predictable,"After reading the first two chapters, I knew by the trite and contrived plots exactly how the whole story would play out. Honestly, though, I couldn't believe it would be that predictable, so I finished the whole book. Yep, I was right about everything - very few surprises. Too bad. The worst one I almost just put the book down and stopped reading right there - unfortunately, I continued. Big waste of my reading time. I am done with this author - I need something a lot more complicated to keep my interest."
5,a compelling read,"This novel kept me up till 3 a.m., and I awakened at 10:30 today only to make my coffee before finishing the book. This mystery has complicated characters whose flaws add depth and breadth to the entertaining story.This author excels at writing a perfect mystery as well as creating memorable characters and dynamic plot twists.His details of southern family life are perfect."
1,King of overblown emotion,"John Hart has read too much Thomas Wolfe but adopts the worst elements of his fellow North Carolinian's style and misses the best. His narrator is weak and unsympathetic and from beginning to end gives no satisfactory account of himself or his motives. It's difficult to fathom how his true love, a sort of work-hardened earth mother, could stand him any more than a reader can. The most interesting and even well drawn character is the police detective who understandably loathes him until she experiences an implausible change of heart a feeling that few readers will share."
2,Was this really a John Hart novel?,"Having been riveted by Iron House, Down River and The Last Child, I eagerly began to read King of Lies expecting to have the same page-turning, can't-wait-to-see-what-happens-next experience and the joyful exchange of ideas with my friends. Instead, I found the characters to be unsympathetic and already defeated. Their end-of-the-story redemptions came a little too late for me to share in their life triumphs. Perhaps the plethora of distracting and upsetting typos, and sometimes missing words, made it too difficult to concentrate on the story."
2,Tedium reigns,"I'd read another book by Hart, previously, so was looking forward to this one. While the story was interesting, it plodded along, especially in the beginning, bogged down with a considerable volume of extraneous prose, more for self's sake, than to advance the story line. And the ending took forever to wind down, tieing up loose ends I didn't even remember or consider needed tieing up."
4,Good book for a debut,"Pretty nice mystery for a debut. I'll admit I couldn't put it down until I finished. As noted in the other reviews, there are some pretty obvious plot holes and unrealistic behaviour but it was a good read."
4,I read it twice,Kept my interest all through and am looking for another John Hart book. Any book about the southern states interest me.
2,Reviewers Love Whiners?,"How did this novel get so many five-star reviews in the newspapers and here on Amazon? I was sorry to read this book, which was told in first person by a whiner. The whining goes on and on. Whine-iness is not a pleasant or commendable or sympathetic character trait. At least I think it's not. I dislike whining and whiners and don't see what the point of spending time with them is, real-life or literary. However, I had paid money for the book and so I read it. It never gripped me, and the hero made stupid decisions, lessening even more (if possible) any empathy I had for him."
5,Fantastic,"This book kept me interested from page one to the very end. I didn't want to put it down. I love John Hart's writing style, he does a superb job in regards to description and really draws you into the book. I hated reaching the end of it, I just wanted it to go on."
5,"A good Whodunnit with high literary value, good characters","A small-town lawyer's midlife crisis is sparked by the discovery of the dead body of his overbearing father. Although told in the first person, the tale gives good background and many interesting stories about other characters. In his search for his father's killer, the narrator uncovers a lot of dirt, human suffering, and neglect in his small town, all while trying to juggle his own affairs and keep himself out of jail as the prime suspect. Our first-person narrator has a good literary style while not sounding too cute about it (unlike some other famous authors' attempts at first-person writing).It would seem very difficult to write a good first-person thriller, giving the reader all of the necessary clues to solve the case while still making us go ""D'oh, I should have known!"" at the end. Kudos to the author for pulling it off."
1,sexist and homophobic,"I really wanted to like this book, but could not stand the depiction of women. The wife is a real ball-buster, the lesbian character is basically insane, and the one female with a heart is constantly being mistreated by the main character -- an alcoholic with the emotional depth of a high schooler. He's a nasty bit of business, not someone I enjoyed spending time with."
4,My hometown author,"I enjoyed this book very much. It takes place in my hometown and I could easily picture the locations described, especially those of downtown Salisbury and the old Towne Mall. I shopped there often before it closed, and remember that a body was actually found there. This book was very fast-paced and contained a lot of twists and turns that left me guessing. The ending was excellent and tied up the loose ends very well. It was not as action-packed as ""Iron House"", but I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good murder mystery. I look forward to reading more of John Hart's books."
4,Keeps you turning the pages,"Whilst not as gripping as The Last Child, this book was still very readable. Dealt a bit with issues such as one's 'life plan'."
1,Reading This is Work,"Attorneys, especially trial attorneys have quick, clever minds. They think fast on their feet. They are skillful wordsmiths. Not Jackson ""Work"" Pickens, the protagonist in this plodding tale. Reading it was...well...work. Long build-ups for Work's reaction to a situation or a person followed by his irritating and ultimately predictable impotance. One needn't take the time to read a novel where the word ""pathetic"" seemed the most fitting adjective for its cental character."
2,DEPRESSING,"I read to be entertained, and reading of some fictional character's endless depression and inner turmoil is not entertaining. I am fed up with main characters that are suffering endless inner turmoil. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is extremely well written. I have already purchased his second book, but if it is more of the same, I will toss it."
3,Entertaining & fast read. ..loose end,"A very enjoyable, fast-paced book; impressive for a debut work.I enjoyed reading ""The King of Lies"" very much. I'd give it 3+ stars really but there are a few problems. Some of the characters are a bit cliched. I didn't dwell on this because the story moves along so rapidly that this is easily overlooked.What bothered me the most was the loose end.What became of Jean's daughter? This child was mentioned only in passing but the lack of desire to find this child calls into question Work's good-guy image. Is this end intentional or debut author oversight?I also questioned Jean's rapid ability to seemingly overcome her emotional problems. I think that Jean is supposed to be a sympathetic character but abandoning her daughter only made me dislike her.Despite these problems, problems for me anyway, I have recommended this book to others who have purchased and enjoyed it."
1,Horrible,Don't bother reading this book. I'm shocked at the 4 and 5 star reviews it received from others. Such a disappointment.
2,"Promising, but fails","I read this because of Pat Conroy's blurb - since I love his writing, thought his opinion would count for something. I was very disappointed. While the writing is good, for me, the overall book fails. It is set in North Carolina, but there is very little Southern atmosphere - it could just as easily be set in the midwest. The hero is an attorney, but does some incredibly stupid things, such as trading his car, destroying evidence, making statements, waiving hearings, etc., etc. And he constantly makes assumptions based upon feelings, not facts. I get it that he is ""flawed"", but he is also basically stupid. Why did no one research Alex when she first popped up? And while we hear repeatedly how awful the father was, there are very few actual examples. The mother is a paper figure (pun intended). I generally don't dwell on books like this - I read an average of a book a day - but I think I'm upset because Pat Conroy let me down."
4,You'll Love this book,"Fast paced and an enjoyable read.You'll Love this author if you like Harlan Coben, John Grisham, Baldacci, et alHave FUN"
5,Good Stuff,Just what I wanted at the best price...What else is there to say to get to the limit of the required word limit.
3,Historic Safety People,This book describes the life and times of a person famous for being one of the first practicioners in the career of Public Health. It places her work in historic context and is an example of the start of a very worthwhile activity. Health concerns remain one of the major problems in the work environment. Many are still unaware of the contaminents that can make them sick.
5,easy to read translation,Using this daily bible is truly a delight! The NKJV is easy to read and easy to understand. If your looking for a good daily bible this is the one to get!
3,NKJV Daily Bible,"I feel the quality of paper used is very thin and cheap, otherwise the bible is fine.It seems a sign of our times that the quality is getting worse and worse. This is a bible, the quality should be the best or at least acceptable. I have had many daily bibles this is the first time I have had this problem."
5,Pure Enjoyment,This is so simple to read on my kindle. It enriches my day so tremendously! I recommend it for even the most seasoned Bible readers.
5,Great study tool.,"I have the soft cover and thought it would be a great tool to have a digital version for the kindle app for the ipad. When I saw what a good price it was, I figured it was worth it. Once downloaded and installed, I found this ebook user friendly and is easy to use. Now, I can take the ipad anywhere on vacation or business and won't have to pack the bulky book. The kindle app is a good asset for the ipad and so is this study guide ebook version. Well worth it for the portability. The book arranges old testament, Psalm, Proverbs, and new testament readings for the day. It is not a commentary but a great tool for reading the bible in a year. If you like the regular hard copy book, you'll appreciate this ebook version."
4,Is very easy to keep up with daily Bible reading.,The only thing that would make it better is if it incorporated Strong's Dictionary in the Kindle version. Then it would be perfect!
1,NKJV Daily Bible on Kindle Touch,"I purchased this bible a few days ago, hoping to be able to get in a better reading habit. I do not know anything about the printed version of this bible, but the on the Kindle Touch, navigating this bible is completely frustrating. I have wasted 3 mornings trying to get going on a one year reading plan and I'm done. This may be more about my kindle, and this bible may work just fine if you are using buttons to navigate, but the touch likes to skip pages and when you are dependent on links to get from one part of a daily reading to the next, it just doesn't work. I thought this would be like the other One Year Bible's I have had in the past where you find the date and the readings are right there without having to find the right link. I'm sure that the paper version of this book is probably just fine."
5,cannonball,"I though the book was better than the movie, because it told a lot about what happened during the race even from more points of view then the author."
3,Undergrad Paper Tricks,"This book brings me back to my college days. What's the best way to increase the size of a paper (w/o changing font size!)? Put in a bunch of quotes from other sources. Sure, the quotes may be relevant and at times even necessary. But, a ten page paper full of quotes is not the same as a ten page paper solely of your own material.Yate's book is full of sections written by Cannonball participants. Sure, it's good to get their point of view and some of the stories are great. Unfortunately, the structure results in a disjointed book that doesn't do a good job of keeping the excitement of the story going. In fact, despite the exciting subject, the book is often a little boring. Buy it if you're really interested in the story (like I am). Skip it otherwise."
3,brock bored??,Thank goodness for participant submissions. They seemed to go over the same stories but they were more interesting that Brock's version.
3,Great tale of success from El Exilio,the most successful talk show host on Spanish language television. (...)
1,The worst book ever!,"Bad sintaxis, exagerated and self-serving worthless reading for a worthless egomaniac! Sorry!"
5,Very impressed!,"Alright, im not the biggest wrestling fan. But im defenately a Psychopathic Records fan. So i bought the video JCW. I'd have to say I was very impressed. Well the wrestling was a lil fake, but the commentary by Shaggy and Violent J were hilarious!!! They had me rollin over laughing throughout the whole video. Just hearing the comentary by ICP and the juggalos in the audience goin wild made this video something worth picking up. If your not a juggalo, you might not like this as much as a juggalo would, but if u are, you'll love it!!!"
4,not very good wrestling but who cares,the wrestling in this video is good at times but nothing special. but who cares! this isnt a video for wrestling fans its a movie for juggalos! with gweedo and DDD (shaggy and J) on commentary this video is funny as hell its definitley worth it if your a true fan but not if your just a wrestling fan.
3,Good adaptation,"This didn't capture the true intensity of Robert Musil's novel. As a film adaptation goes, I was pleased with the results of this. A boy commits a petty crime. As punishment some classmates sadistically torture him. A boy named Toerless stands in the back and observes all of the action. For some reason when I read the book I didn't think about the connection between World War II and the boys. It's a metaphor for the times. The movie made this clear to me. Barbara Steele has a bit part."
3,I have an ambiguous feeling about this,"Early in the film, Torless' math teacher tells him everything comes down to feelings, even mathematics. Then two of Torless' friends start torturing Basini for stealing. Torless watches, pondering the nature of good and evil while Basini is beaten, stabbed and hung. It's kind of like a sadistic version of ""My Night at Maud's,"" where violence instead of sex is the problem, or maybe more like that Matt Dillion movie, ""My Bodyguard,"" only here instead of saving Basini, the Linderman character is questioned before his professors where they decide he's too intellectually ambitious for their school and they ship him off to somewhere fancier. Basini gets a wedgie, but since he doesn't know what a good education really is, he doesn't seem to mind too much."
1,"Bizarre ""foreign film"" unsettling and unrewarding","This poor story on film is an example of a ""foreign film"" which leaves me wondering, ""What?!"". The story is not interesting, except maybe for a glimpse into the lives of boys in private school(?) in old...Germany or Prussia(It doesn't matter).This is not worth any $$ or time unless you get your kicks watching a boy getting treated badly and ""tortured"" in b&w. I recommend Closely Watched Trains instead if you want bizarre that entertains!"
5,The grandfather of platforming,"Back then, ET and the Atari version of Pac-Man had the gaming industry destroyed in 1983. Two years later, Nintendo created the NES and, along with Super Mario Bros, it saved the gaming industry.Super Mario Bros is a terrific NES game that would always remain fun until the day we die.The gameplay is what you would expect from a 2D Mario game: Collecting powerups, top-notch platforming, coins, enemies, etc...The graphics were good at the time.The sounds and music were great, especially at the time. To think some of those noises became iconic ones in Nintendo's world of games.The game is pretty long: You have to go through 8 worlds (4 levels in each) and, if you want, do the harder quest, which replaces Goombas with Buzzy Beetles.Overall, you have to get this game, especially if you are a Mario fan or you want to learn about the video game history."
2,works fine,This is so much fun! It froze sometimes. But still was fun! I loved the stomping on goombas and koopa troopas.
1,weird!,This game is so weird. Bowser has kidnapped princess toadstool. There is no way to continue or save your game. The music also goes fast when the timer reachs 99.
4,Dynamic Francesca,"For me the main reason for buying this CD is Enrique Jorda's conducting of Francesca da Rimini. The sound quality is not the greatest as it was recorded c.1950. Had it been recorded just a few years later, we would have a real sonic winner here. Jorda delivers an intense Francesca Da Rimini, and that is the way it should be. I love the old school French sound and we can get at least a hint of it here within the old grooves. The orchestra is the Paris Conservatoire not the Monte Carlo as shown in the Amazon listing. I would like to see this one come out on Australian Decca Eloquence. They have done wonders with these old English Decca (London) recordings. This transfer is only fair, but it is all we have for now. The Romeo with Van Beinum and the London Philharmonic is not as interesting in my opinion."
2,"Good Torque & Power, Poor Design","We've used this drill for construction, and found that it lacks the good design that most other Milwaukee tools have. Its got good power and torque, but the trigger is way too large, making it more likely to accidently engage than oter drills. Also, when you depress the trigger, your finger/hand often gets pinched between the trigger and housing when you release the trigger. We've found that we really like Milwaukee's cordless drills, but we prefer Porter Cable's corded drills."
5,perhaps the best book on boxing,"I read this book in 2003 when I first started kickboxing in Japan. It's excellent on multiple levels, from some history of boxing to the mentality and respect developed by most who train and box seriously. An extremely well written book, and it's a shame we lost the author at an early age."
4,"Action, Camera, Mystery, Ghost?","This is a well-written book. Up to the end, I was quite intrigued & considered it a 5-star. But, there's lots of violence, the mystery solution wasn't really possible for the reader to figure out (though some of the connections among the people seemed obvious to the reader--though not to the characters in the story), & there seemed to be something missing. I'm not sure if it's only the romantic relationships or the final financial relationships--but something seems lacking to me, & the fast-forward ending portions left something to be desired IMHO. In any case, if you're after a well-told, unusual story with lots of action, you'll probably like this book. The author does provide some interesting, collectible quotes: p. 80: I've spent enough time in therapy to qualify for an honorary degree. p. 144: Jokes can be as true as textbooks. & p. 354: Maybe that's the ultimate revenge. Indifference."
2,Rachel Hayes Goes Down In Flames,"Having admired many of Allyn's short stories, I found this novel disappointing. Allyn never decides whether he's writing a mystery or a supernatural/ghost thriller, and the two don't really work together here. His style seems tentative, too. It slides back and forth between artificial-sounding profanity and an almost prim, slightly wooden narration. Westbrook is a veterinarian, but the violence toward animals in the book felt gratuitous and kept my wife--also an Allyn fan--from reading it when I mentioned it to her (at least one book on writing that I have read cites cruelty to animals as a taboo). Allyn juggles two possible romantic subplots rather clumsily and arbitrarily decides that a character with little stage time is emotionally important. I also found the hired thug cartoonish and the ""solution/final discovery"" far from persuasive. All in all, this feels like it's still a work in progress, several steps below any other Allyn work I've read."
3,Who Is Black?,"This book develops the need for compassion towards those of mixed race. It gives you an insightful view of how light skinned blacks feel about not being ""black enough"". I was hoping that the author would speak out and AGAINST the one drop rule, but instead he sort of leaves you with the feeling that he would rather keep the rule, but change the minds and attitudes of people."
5,A Great Album from an Underappreciated Artist,"Don't let jealous would-be-if-they-could-be critics turn you off of buying this fantastic album with their sour grapes. Carrack is one of the most accomplished soul/pop singers of our era -- and every song on this album is masterfully crafted and a joy to listen to from beginning to end. I consider it an essential purchase. I also highly recommend Carrack's ""Beautiful World."" K.G. Smith -- kgsniagfalls@hotmail.com"
4,soulful,good honest album just leave it on your cd player and watchpeoples moods changein a word a very soothing album!!
3,The 2 head HoMedics is stronger,"I own both this massager and the one with 2 heads, I much prefer the other. This one seems less effective and weaker."
2,Good massage but???,"The unit works well but if you keep the unit plugged in it emits a continuous hum, even when turned off. This means that even though the unit is off it is consuming electric. I can't understand why it is desinged this way. It does explain why the instructions tell you to make sure you unplug the unit after every use. The other issue is the speed button. You have to repeatedly push the button to increase the intensity. My old unit had a slide button which was very easy to adjust. The unit also has a built in timer which shuts the unit automatically after 15 minutes. This is not adjustable and a bit annoying."
3,Big-N-Cool,"Large device, not for one, needs two to Tango. Cumbersome.Heat therapy is a joke, does not even get warm, just red lights.Do not purchase for heat, purchase for raw power. Will cover a large surface fast. Deep hard hitting pulses."
2,some problem witht the power cord,"i bought this product around 3 mths back. and really liked the product. then suddenly some days back, it started working intermittently. goes on and off. if u hold the power cord in a particular angle then it works otherwise not. as i bought it from amazon, so had no way out to return after 3 mths. so tried to repair it on my own but still not working. so dont know if changing the power cord will help. read one more review exactly same with my case but still confuse whether the problem is the switch or power cord. but anyway it has become a waste now. will be thankful, if anybody could help me know how to fix it....."
1,Too heavy for one person,"If there are two people involved in giving and getting a massage with this unit, it might work fine, however, for one person alone, it is much too heavy and awkward to manipulate. It is very large also for one person to handle, you almost need two hands to use it. I was very disappointed as other HoMedics products have been very useful. Actually, I returned the unit."
1,HOMEDICS MASSAGER,"WE BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE OUR MASSAGER WE HAD FOR 9YEARS.THE NEW ONES, HAVE HALF THE POWER AND WERE A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT.WE SENT IT BACK FOR A REFUND AFTER 2 DAYS.WE ORDER THE THUMPER FROM AMAZON AND IT IS TRULY A POWERFULMASSAGER, QUIETER, AND BUILT TO LAST."
4,A God Product,"Pro: This product is well built, with a powerful motor.It performs very well with it's multi-speed four percussion heads and infrared heat.Con: The unit is somewhat heavy.To use on the back and shoulders and will require a second person's assistance for most people.Overall it is money well spent!"
3,Not the origional Tetris!,"This arrived on NES after nintendo won the rights to tetris in a legal battle. The Tengen(Atari) NES version was so much better. It has smoother gameplay (blocks don't get caught on others simply by slightly touching screwing you in the process) it has more songs, better grahpics and it over all a way better version. This version is decent but is not the origional or anything near the best version I have played in my day."
5,"""Passing For Who You Really Are""","A Great Book. Everyone has the right to self-identify. Chapter II, ""White,""""Mixed"" or ""Other""? Some Books and Articles Your Librarian Didn't Tell You About!--gave me lots of resources I used for historical/genealogical research."
1,JUNK,"DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!!! He's incredibly boring, and if you think this dvd will explain the book better, you are wrong. He just follows everything in the book with no explanations whatsoever. BORING, BORING, BORING. AND A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY."
5,a must read before trekking off to asia,"no, this is not a travel guide. it does not give listings and directions for sights, food, and lodging. it is a practical guide for backpackers (and other independent travelers) heading off to asia. this guide lists visa requirements for all of the asian nations (for visitors from many countries), gives suggestions on routes throughout asia, generalizations about transport, lodging, and meals, recommendations on what to take, and insights on what to expect. it is a very useful tool, packed with necessary information. you could leave for asia without it onhand, but do not leave for asia before reading it."
5,Garbage Holds Its Treasures,"I never thought reading about garbage would be interesting - well, okay, actually I did, otherwise I would have never read this book. I mean that I didn't suspect the book would be so darn interesting. Garbage really sheds a strong light on the culture that generates it. Just think, your garbage tells us a lot about who you are. Future archaeologists are going to love digging through our old garbage in a few thousand years. Oh, what a story it will tell."
5,A Classic,Great book. Rathje is a engaging figure that delivers a good story - the story of our garbage.Highly recommended.
4,Extra Text for my Archaeology class.,EVerything you ever wanted to know about garbage in america and more. Acutally this is an interesting book. I was mosyt suprised with how people report their consumerism and the reality. If you entersted in recycling and reducing your carbon footprint this is a must read book.
5,The BEST album you will never hear on the radio,"Never heard of the Wondermints until browsing Amazon suggested I might like this (browsing America, Gerry Beckley, Jeff Larson, Timothy Schmit, Beckley-Lamm-Wilson). This is probably the strongest CD I have heard in the last 10-20 years. Every song could be a top 40 hit, but current radio oligopoly will never play them. Alas, this will have to be the best indie record out there that never makes it to radio. Brian Wilson (his backing band = Wondermints) knows gold when he hears it, but the industry execs just don't ""get it"" anymore. Too bad..."
5,"Wondermints do make love to you with this album, you'd better believe it","The first disc that gave me an idea of what good is Wondermints like, was ""Smile"", by Brian Wilson. As many reviewers have already said, Wondermints has been the backup band of that genius of American Pop Art Music, and brainmaster of Beach Boys, Brian Wilson.The songs are very well crafted, and they recover sounds and sensibilities that have been alive in music since the sixties, mainly music based in melodic and harmonic craftmanship as the one heard on this disc, intended to create in people's minds a feeling of bliss, tenderness and happiness. No wonder why the phrase that opens the lyrics notebook is:""...the right to remain tender"". And it is this right that shines in songs like ""shine on me"", ""sweetness"", ""something I knew"" and ""so nice"" among others. So, people, allow the Wondermints to make love to you, do not mind, accept their music, and you will not be dissapointed."
3,Strange Record,I'm Gonna Get You Yet is about the only totaly stand out track on this record. Its an alright record - I'm just not hammered on it.
2,retard dolphins,All pieces of this set were decent except the shower curtain. It was not the same pattern. It's a very awful looking set of dolphins that can be described as nothing other than retard dolphins. If you want this for for everything but the curtain then you are good.
3,Why didn't I read the reviews?,I saw this and thought it was a nice little set to tide us over until our newborn can express an interest in what she wants in a nicer bathroom design. Wow - Fat-Eyed Dolphin is amazing. I put it up to amuse myself but please don't buy this if you think the shower curtain will look at all attractive. The paint jobs on the ceramic pieces were done by one handed blind workers under duress. 3 stars for amusing me. 2 stars for quality.
4,"Poor font, OK, but a good smell and a great read","I loved this book and, although very out of date (AED RWord, FORTRAN and so on), I still read bits from time to time. Not a book to buy these days - get one that uses a language that *you* use."
4,GAL CANTA TOM JOBIM,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD. GAL COSTA IS A FANTASTIC SINGER AND HER RENDITION OF TOM JOBIMS SONGS ARE EXCEPTIONAL. I AM VERY HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND THIS DVD AND ANYONE WHO DECIDES TO PURCHASE IT WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
3,"Its not quite a 2, but definately not a 3!","I gotta be honest: not a good movie. I feel like you have to be real loyal to Mr. Romero to say you liked this movie. The acting was lame and so was the premise. I know its not possible now, but maybe in a few months or his next term in office, Obama can make it so we can return movies that we feel are just bad.I was really let down and hope you won't waste your money on this. Mr. Romero seems to be smoking some really horrible stuff to be happy with this movie."
2,Ugh...yawn,"Whomever paid to make this movie must be as dumb as a zombie...talk about a bad plot, bad acting, bad makeup/special effects, etc. I only watched it due to my love for zombie films. Sadly, I'll never get that time back. Nothing about this movie made it worth a watch. Two stars for being a zombie flick. Zero stars for the content."
2,I dont care who directed this....it was dreadful,"Is this the worse movie I have rented through Amazon? No. Is it the worse movie George Romero has put out? No. Is it at all a good movie? No.....it was absolutely dreadful. If Romero hasnt ""lost it"", he has certainly ""misplaced it""......this wasnt worth the small rental price I paid to see the thing. I wouldnt recommend this movie to my worst enemy.....well, maybe I would....but he would be the only one I would recommend it to.....absolutely dreadful!!"
2,Zombies thud in this dud,"Is this all that George Romero can do? That is, make zombie movies. Granted, I was a fan of a couple but this one is really poorly done. Perhaps that could have been expected under some circumstances but he actually directs this mess. Unknown actors show why they are unknown. We have the usual suspects, i.e. studly macho dude, Latino, dorky guy and hot chick of mixed race square off against the zoms and some latent Irish tribes on an island off the Delaware coast. Poor direction, editing, acting and story pretty much sums it up. It did have a few new zombie killing tricks but overall lacks tension and everything else that makes up a satisfying film.The Blu ray transfer and the DTS-HD Master Audio are both first rate. No problems there. There is also a plethora of special features to make most viewers happy."
2,I'm a big horror fan and even a bigger fan of Zombies,"I don't wanna spend to much time doing a long review. I just wanted to say I was very disappointed in this one. I don't know why I continue watching Romeros movies anymore. I loved the first 3 night, dawn and day of the dead, but everything he has done recently has been pedestrian. I really wouldn't recommend it even to a big fan of the zombie genre. If you can't get enough of B-movie zombie films than go for it. Otherwise stay well clear of this dud."
3,Some humor now and then...It helps.,"This is quite gory, as one would expect a film about zombies to be, but at least it has some humor here and there to give the viewer a break. On a small island, a stubborn man is trying to train the zombies to eat something other than human flesh and perhaps even to be useful in some way. His longtime rival has other ideas, and then a small group of soldiers comes along into the fray."
2,Not My Favorite...,"Not my favorite Romero movie by a long shot.What was up with the fake Irish accents when it was supposed to be an island off the coast of Rhode Island???I think Romero needs to let someone else write his scripts for him, because that is clearly not his strong suit."
2,Burial of the Dead,"The title ""Survival of the Dead"" gets it all wrong. I don't think that the Romero series will survive after this weak movie! Lousy acting (annoying stereotypes throughout), lame storytelling (there's no suspense at all, not even one single shock moment) and pretty bad make-up and gore effects. Mr. Romero definitely did a lot better in the past!"
3,Okay as a rental for Survival of the Dead,I have collected about all of George Romero's films on DVD. I felt like this movie was not his best. It is still worth renting it at the a dollar rental machine. I though Diary of the Dead was much better.
2,i don't think george has much left to say about zombies,"is this one better than the one with dennis hopper? yeah but that ain't sayin' much. i liked ""diary of the dead "" better than this one but it's watchable, that's about it. and as george tells you at the beginning of the movie, ""don't forget to laugh""."
3,SOTD,"definately not Georges' best work, but a nice add to the collection. seems they went for a more comic feel with this movie rather then blood guts and 10 minute zombie flesh eating scenes. one thumb up."
1,Hatfields and the McCoys,NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY ACCEPT PURE TRASH.THAT'S WHAT I DID WITH MINE RIGHT IN GARBAGE.SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE. BEEN A FAN FOR A LONG TIME BUT THIS IS JUST BAD.
4,The ONLY Dead Movie worth a flip,I have watched all of the dead movies so far and this is the only one that truly kept me interested through the whole thing. Granted I was young when I first became attracted to the Dead series and the blood and gore left little to the imagination. I am impressed with the storyline of this one.
1,The Romero zombie series has now seen its own death,"We are Romero fans.I should clarify that to say we are fans of the first three (3) ""DEAD"" series of Zombie movies.Since then, each new Zombie treatment from Romero has been worse and worse.With this film, even Romero's usual commentary about mankind and society seems off base.Maybe he has lost touch, but not only is the film bad, but his attempt at a deeper meaning misses the mark here also.The acting is bad. The story is silly. The effects are poor. The message is flawed. The zombie attacks are stiff.There is no tension, no suspense, no feeling of impending doom, you care nothing for the main characters, it plods along with no energy.Nothing in this film works.Romero still deserves much respect for effectively creating the modern Zombie movie ....... but it is looking like he has lost the magic touch when it comes to his own Zombie stories.You can probably skip this one and not feel like you missed anything."
3,Neither Great nor Terrible,"I recently watched Survival of the Dead and thought it was neither terrible nor amazing. While it definitely isn't on par with his other films, Romero has still crafted a solid zombie film with Survival of the Dead. The story is decent and the climax is filled with gory zombie action. My chief complaints with the film are that for whatever reason you never get the sense that claustrophobic sense that you are surrounded by zombies like in other Romero films and the use of CGI is not very strong. Romero would have been better off saving the money spent on the CGI to pay for good makeup effects and fill the screen with many more zombies."
2,The Dumbing of the Dead,"I'm begrudgingly giving this 2 stars out of respect for George Romero in much the same way the Academy of Motion Picture & Sciences doles out the occasional Academy Award based on someone's body of work rather than what they've actually been nominated for that year. I can only hope that if Romero is going to do another zombie movie, the next one isn't as laborious, and dare I say, stupid. He seems to be lowering the bar on the zombie genre, a bar that he set rather high with Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. Sadly, that bar has been creeping downward ever since, and watching this movie, one wonders how much lower can Romero's bar go? That said, if he were to make another, I'll be there even if others around him continue to raise the genre to new heights."
3,I thought it was better than most...,"Once again... I wish I could do 3-1/2 stars. While not as good as George Romero's classics & also not as good as his last outing (Diary Of The Dead, which I liked...) I thought most of the reviews of this movie were unfair. Acting is pretty good. Even some of the action. And it plays as a direct spin-off from Diary Of The Dead, which I always like. Continuity & tying things together is always fun. If you don't like it at first, stick with it. It gets better."
1,Disappointed of the Dead,"Greetings fellow '...of the Deaders':It is with deep regret that a Romero film has finally bit the undead on the ass as the ""Survival of the Dead"" really sucks, blows and stinks!If I had seen it BEFORE ordering it, I would have saved my money.The concept of two family of idiots fighting over their dead relatives and keeping them chained up around (as long as they're out of biting range) is INANE! And of course the living kill of the remaining living humans with no guilt or further thought! Reminds me of ""the Dawn of the Dead"" when a scientist teaches a zombie to behave. I found Flynn and his lunatic opposite both due a double tap to the brain. Just dumb. Oh and the sceanery of an island off Delaware doesn't have mountains in the background... The whole film was disjointed and pathetic...I love zoombie films but they have to havea plot; this film was made to make money off the Romero name and prior great zoombie films. Sorry George."
2,"Sadly...Romero totally missed on this latest ""...of the dead"" installment","First, I consider Romero to be THE authority when it comes to the zombie genre. Everyone since his first zombie movie has patterned their style of zombies after his. So I sadly have to say that this movie was a disappointment. The character development is poor, the acting is subpar and hammy, there is no chemistry between the actors, and the script is reminiscent of a poorly written 70s film. I bought this DVD because I am a fan of zombie movies and I thought I couldn't go wrong with a Romero movie. I'm still hopeful that Romero will continue making ""...of the dead"" movies and will remain a fan despite this movie but hopefully the next installment will be better."
2,Really pathetic,This was quite a pathetic undertaking.The acting qualifies as marginally better than mediocre.The special effects are extremely weak and very under-done for today's quality of movies.The plot was very thin and barely held my attention. I checked Facebook and Reddit several times throughout the movie.Don't waste your time and money.
2,OUCH ! Rather be bit by Zombie,Very disappointed .The movie seems a lil disjointed at times.Day of the Dead was much better and more interesting.Sorry George.
1,Positive review ... really?,"I can't even begin to explain just how horrible this movie was. Purchased it through Comcast's On-Demand service for $10 and feel like an idiot for wasting my money. If you know nothing about this film try to imagine a budget zombie movie with ridiculously bad special effects having sex with a badly acted Irish gang movie ... this is the result.Aren't zombies supposed to be scary anymore? WTF was up with that zombie chick riding across the island on a horse? And Romero is the one that scoffs at ""fast"" zombies in other movies (all of which are worlds better than this disaster) and he has zombies riding around on horses?What were Romero and whoever dared tag their name to this movie thinking when they put this turd together...?The worst part is I really do hate giving this movie a bad review, as it drags down a genre I really love."
1,horrible.,horrible dialougehorrible actinghorrible storyonly 2 families on this island? hellooooooooo inbreeding.What a waste of time and money
2,This Sucks,Im a big fan of George Romero movies but this one sucks I wont recommend this movie even as a $1.00 rental. I actually thought this movie would be pretty good too. The story line is completely lam and cheesy.
1,"Terrible, terrible film!","This is a terrible film! I love George Romero's zombie flicks (yes, even ""Land of the Dead"" & ""Diary of the Dead""), but this movie is a dud!I understand that this film was made on a very small budget, but it's a complete mess; the movie tries to be funny and isn't, it tries to be scary and is not,tries to be thought provoking but fails and worst of all it isn't even entertaining.This is a terrible film!"
2,They could have made this movie alot better..instead they added alot of crap into it,"I have to say George's best movies were Night of the Living dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. Land of the dead was bad, but I felt Diary of the Dead was somewhat better. The first 3 films had some intensity to them but his latest film is just plain stupid. I managed to pick up the blu ray dvd at a local retailer yesterday and viewed it last night. They put it on their shelves a couple of days earlier then its set release date. It was a waste of 18.50 inclusive of tax, LOL!I just couldnt get into the film for some reason, the acting was bad and the storyline is pretty lame. He could have made the film by leaving all the action in PA where people are fighting to stay alive from the zombies, instead of adding all this bloody stupid clan fighting nonsense. I would suggest that you rent this movie at Red Box or something before you consider purchasing it. I made a mistake but hey thats life, right!?"
3,decent movie from Romero,"George Romero once again proves his movies have more depth than the obvious. While not a stunning cinematic classic, this movie touches on a lot of the more subtle human behaviors that codify his earlier works. Worth a look, though not a movie to go out of your way for."
2,Disappointing,"Same o'l, same o'l. I was hoping for better from George Romero. I like Zombie movies; but story, characters and special effects are all second rate."
2,Wish I'd watched something else,I enjoy good horror movies. There are some good zombie movies out there but this wasn't one of them. Looked more of a really bad B-movie rather than a work to be taken seriously. Pick another zombie movie and watch it instead of this one
3,"""Not Bad, But A Little Disappointing!""","George Romero's 2009 horror film features 2 rival families and Armysoldiers facing zombies that might be able to be cured. This isn'tbad, but a little disappointing. Greg Nicotero's zombie make-upeffects are great as usual and this dvd set has nice picture andsound plus neat extras. I still recommend this if you're a zombiefan."
2,Joy luck club meets Korea,"Take any chapter out of the Joy Luck Club, make it about 100 pages longer and there you have it - Comfort Woman! I'm really tiring of these Asian mother fixated books. This book just went on and on, focusing on the mother (a very interesting character whom the book should have been solely about) and a lackluster daughter. If you want to read this book, I suggest skipping the chapters devoted to the daughter. It will make a much better read."
3,Blah,"Nora Okja Keller's book takes place in two voices: a Korean mother, and her American born daughter. The chapters are interspersed, and together, tell the story of how the mother left Korea, married the daughter's father, and how she fared in the US. The language is very beautiful, and the story of the mother is absolutely fascinating. However, the daughter's story is far less gripping, and those chapters could be easily skipped. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy a fun read; however, I would not recommend this book to people who are looking for ""good fiction"". The themes are the same themes that run through almost all Asian American Lit written by female authors. It's a memoir, not particularly different from any other memoir. I don't necessarily think that makes this book less entertaining, but don't buy this book if you're looking for anything new and different."
3,A good book. But probably better as a novella.,"This is a good book, with some fine writing, particularly in the first 100 pages or so. After that however, the story seemed to lose some of its power and began to drift. The book evidently came from earlier and shorter effort from the author; I wonder if that might not have been a better format for the story. Still, this book has passages of great beauty (and horror), and is worth a read. Keller has a voice of great sensitivity."
3,Great maddening fun. Super C(heese),"If you run outside and try to dodge the rain it would be an easier task than beating Super C. If you thought Contra had stupid crazy gay amounts of enemies thrown at you from all angles you ain't see nothing until you get owned in Super Cheese. The fun factor is 5/5 but I gave the overall rating 3/5 due to the insane difficulty level and having to beat the game on hard to get a lame ending which is stupid. Lets put the Super Cheese makers at gunpoint and tell them to pass Super C on hard with one credit or they die becasue we fans want to see the damn ending. To Actually be able to play for more than 10 seconds without getting gayed. How come pits, fire, ceilings falling, falling rocks, enemy fire etc only effects the player and the million enemies on the screen at all times don't get hit??"
4,A Terrific Read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Why? Well, it is well-paced, sheds new light on an old character and deals with some large events ably. Throw in some great bad guys, a shock or three and stir in a liberal dose of magic and you have a cracking book. Recommended!"
5,New Orleans at its best - Grace is amazing!,I loved the album and her live shows are incredible. Good production from Allen Toussaint and excellent writing all around. Great Debut album!
5,Super Easy Transaction!,"Shipping time was quick, game was in the condition that was stated, and the price was reasonable. Thanks for the easy transaction!"
2,Who cares if it's Doki Doki Panic,Yes it's a diffrent game with Mario characters yes it's not the best Mario game. But this game is actually a decent game and it's actually a fun game in it's own way it's not a bad at all in fact the truth is why we got a Doki Doki Panic with Mario characters is cause SMB 2 (JAP) is very hard I know I played it on the all stars collection. Nintendo just used this game to tide players over for SMB 3 Nintendo thinking of there bottom line released this instead becuse SMB 2 (JAP) would have killed Mario 3 cause they would have thought that SMB 3 was s**t. Not as good as the 1st the 3rd Super Mario World Mario 64 but still it's a decent Mario game it's fun too. Maybe underrated maybe.
2,The sad truth about this game,"Ok, the original version of SMB 2 was only released on the Famicon which really sucks. This version of the game was a remake of Doki Doki, that is why the story seems really strange for a Mario game.I will reccommend Mario All Stars, if you want to play the original version of this game. At all costs don't get this Doki Doki crap."
1,A few facts about this game,"This game abandons the super mario you know and love. You might not know this, but this game is an exact copy of a game that released in Japan called Doki Doki Panic."
4,Mario,This game worked at first but then kept turning off. I was very pleased with the service I got and was reimbursed for the game. Thanks
2,Boring,What is the point of this game? I don't even play it. It is just sitting in a case. Waste of money.
3,cartridge has problems,"While the game works the cartridge is messed up. I bought my wife a Nintendo and a few games for Christmas, this being one of them, and all the games work except this one. With this game you can play it but all the graphics are messed up. I've cleaned the strip and everything but nothing has fixed it. As I said before all the others I bought work perfectly this on being the exception"
5,memories,love this game. its just as i remembered. easy and fun. i recommend this game for sure. love it love it
1,super mario borthers 2 review,"Even though i searched for super nintendo games, this game is for the original nintendo. It would have cost more to send back, so i ust ended up keeping it"
4,Works as advertised - supports 64-bits,"Unfortunately, ver. 9 did not support WinXP - 64-bit, this version does and seems to be a 64-bit app in this setting (as opposed to 32-bit). Seems faster than previous version as well.Only dislikes are: inability to easily eliminate ""dead space"" beyond just defragmentation, and that it installs itself as a ""service"". This can be turned on and off with a ""NET STOP Diskeeper"" / ""NET START Diskeeper"" batch files."
5,this CD brings back memories!!,"had this on cassette years ago when it came out, i wore it out i played it so much!! nice to get it remastered on CD, sounds AWESOME!!! highly recommend this CD to all who love the music of the late 80's / early 90's along the lines of Skid Row, etc..... thanks"
5,BRUTAL NYC ROCK,"This is brutal, pounding, scathing and abrasive NYC style metallic rock. No glam, no bombastic and overdrawn power metal, thrash, death, black, grind or what have you; just loud and in your face ""RAWK"" power.If you are a fan of such songs as: gangland (tygers of pan tang), cold sweat (thin lizzy), slave to the grind (skid row), tooth and nail (dokken), hard driver (badlands), you could be mine (GNR), can't get enough (scorpions), monkey's blood (tokyo blade), under my gun (icon), rebel in the fdg (WASP) and the ilk, you will most likely enjoy this.On top of that, think of TED NUGENT on steroids."
3,GOOD SLEAZE RELEASE,"AFTER SEEING A GOOD REVIEW ON SLEAZEROXX I DECIDED TO GO FOR THIS ALBUM , I THINK THEY MADE GOOD START, IF ITS NOT GREAT BUT ITS A GOOD HARD ROCKING ALBUM AND IF YOU ARE 80' SLEAZE METAL LOVER I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A SHOT."
5,HEAVEN IS ROCKIN !,GREAT CD ! ROCKS THROUGHOUT. YES IT REMINDS ME SOMEWHAT OF SKIDROW MUSICALY BUT THEN AGAIN THE VOCALS REMIND ME OF BUZZ SHERMAN OF MOXY AND THATS NOT BADCONSIDERING EARY MOXY WAS ROCKING IT IN THE SEVENTIES AND SHERMAN WAS A CHOICETO REPLACE BON SCOTT IN ACDC.THIS IS ANOTHER GOOD FIND GRAB IT WHILE ITS AVAILABLE !!
4,One of the three best to end the metal era,"One would never know this is a debut album based on the delivery of the material. It's well engineered, well mixed and features a diversified song selection as well. I'd rank this between Welcome to the Jungle and the Sea Hags' first. It's that good and every bit as powerful as the Nirvana album (Nevermind) that left it in the dust. Had the band worn flannel instead of leather and lived in L.A. or Seattle instead of New York at that time, they'd probably still be here."
1,Werther- Complete Opera,This was very disappointing. It was a copy and almost impossible to view. This was not how it was represented.
2,I dislike this recording.,"I am over seventy years old and I have listened to bagpipe music all my life (although I am not a player). In this particular recording, what sounds like drumming on the rims of the drums ( a harsh, clacking sound) obscures the pipe music and is very distracting."
1,i like music of bagpipe,"sir i am a bagpiper and sir i love bagpiper , in karachi there is no bag pipe cds are availabel so sir if you dont mind please send me one two cds on this adress. flat no#25,taj prince heights, plot no 402 , gold street garden east karachi.(pakistan)"
1,AVOID LIKE A PLAGUE ...,"This book is a bundle of psychobabble, whatever it is he wants to say here not gonna help you learn assembly. Heres how this ""masterpiece"" treats addition/subtraction: 10 lines of text (!!!), and then he gives you an exercise to do. What the heck happens in the registers, why - nothing about that. You figure it out. I tried to find ""EFFECTIVE ADDRESS"" in this book - no such luck - apparently, must be a government secret. Waste of money."
2,Good but way too mature for it's targeted audience.,"This book is fabulous. If you're older than 15 years old.It's very well written. I like it alot.But, for my son..it's a bit much.It's plot is much to mature for kids.It makes hints at sex, shows outright violence, and includes name calling (numerous times).It's not a book that we will be reading to our kids any time soon. It will be put away until they are older.It's unfortunate because it is very interesting and well written. Just has more violence, sex, name calling than I would like for my kids.And i'm not one of those stuck up parents..we all know what i mean. This book is still too much, in my opinion."
1,A big disappointment after the first book,"We were very excited to buy another Miss Spider book for a gift. After reading it, we returned it to the store. The theme of the story is far too adult for the target age group. Also, we bought the book for a little girl, and I found the messages regarding women needing to be married a bit dated. Also, for the littler ones, the antagonist is too scary. The only good part of the book is the beautuiful illustrations."
1,This book is horrid,"I am a parent of a first-grader who brought the book home from her school library. It is unlike any other ""Miss Spider"" books I've read, due to the scary pictures, evil character (Spiderus), and romantic plot. The expressions on the faces of the bugs, especially Spiderus, are frightening. The courtship of Holley and Miss Spider was a little bit too ""adult-oriented"". If it were a movie, I think this book would get a PG-13 rating. I skipped most of the paragraphs and I am considering a request to withdraw this book from circulation at my daughter's school. What was David Kirk thinking? There are many ways he could have created a story about Miss Spider's wedding, and yet he chose this twisted storyline."
1,Not A Children's Book,"I fell in love with the art work of the Miss Spider books and bought a few for my son. When we saw this book at the library I figured it was another good book in the series. I was wrong. The content of this book is definately not aimed at children. It hints at intimacy that young children don't need to be exposed to and some of the pictures are rather scary. I stopped halfway through the book, noticing some of the pictures. They could very likely give a child nightmares. Children do not need to be exposed to this content and violence depicted in the story. Let's keep them young a little while longer yet please."
2,Replete with errors.,"A very poorly-compiled book. Spend the money to get a good textbook, or the Nova series physics review (for the MCAT), which is much better. Formulas are incorrect, calculations done wrong, etc. Will have you pulling your hair out. A waste of time."
3,Doesn't Do Enough,"While looking through the Common Body of Knowledge for the CSTE Certification of QAI, I saw that this book was part of the suggested reading list.It was written by William Perry and Randall Rice (both of whom I had read before, and both of whom work for QAI), so I thought I'd buy a copy and give it a shot.It's not bad as far as listing testers' challenges, but for me, it doesn't do enough to indicate how to actually solve those challenges. I don't necessarily agree that these are the top ten challenges, nor that they are ordered correctly. But if I did, I'd want more practical help in solving them. Still, it's a good high-level overview of these solutions.The book has a rather unusual format - each of the ten challenges is discussed in a chapter, using the same format for each chapter.Here's an outline:- Overview- State of the Practice- Impact on Testing- Solutions to the Challenge- Solution Impediments- Guidelines for Success- Plan of Action"
4,DENON DVD1720,"Pros:-VERY responsive-Easy to use-Simple setupCons:-Bad remote layout-Confusing on/off light-No time displayI really like this DVD player, but am not impressed by the following. The remote layout is very strange compared to other brands. The on/off light on the unit is either red or green at all times making the home theater looking like fireworks. There is no time display on the unit."
2,My First Denon and my LAST!,"Over the years (50) I have owned many electronic devices (ONKYO, Panasonic, Sony, JVC, ICOM, Yaesu, Kenwood, you name it) and most have served me will. My Denon DVD1720 lasted about 4 months, then would lock up. I thought I was buying the best, especially since I paid a premium for the Denon line. I was wrong. My other three Players (Two JVC and a Panasonic) are still going strong. I sent it in two week ago to a service center only 40 miles from my home and have not heard from them. This was my FIRST Denon product and my LAST."
2,Not a book for those with the AP philosophy...,"I found a couple of good ideas (i.e. not discussing eating during the meal and placing food on the plate and giving your child the option of eating it or not), but for the most part I found the suggestions by the author to be a bit extreme. I should have known it wasn't the book for me when he suggested using the Ferber method to get your child to sleep and not nursing on demand past the first few months.I don't think locking your 2 year old in his/her room will make for a better eating style. In fact, I think down the road it will cause problems when your child is a teen and decides to lock YOU out of their room.If you are someone who thinks using the Ferber method on your child is a good idea, you will probably find this book helpful, but for the parents with a more AP approach will find this book extremely distasteful."
1,Wasn't impresed...,"I tried this book and I have to say it was not very helpful to me. My daughter has always been picky and i tried everything to get her to try new things. The suggestions were not for me and I felt like we were going nowhere. Truthfully, it was a DVD that really helped her! I found it here on Amazon - the company is called tinyguides and the kids on the DVD are actually eating and enjoying all sorts of foods. When I got it for her, she loved it so much and was even willing to try some new things. Anyway, just thought it could help some other moms who were still trying to find books to help THEM (the moms). Maybe the best thing is to get a tool that is geared to the KIDS themselves!"
5,MUST read for all parents or caregivers,I bought this book to prevent my child from becoming a picky eater. I use the general philosophy of the author with my home daycare and have recommended this method to other parents and providers with great success. I had one boy who at almost 3 yrs old came to my daycare literally throwing up at the sight of carrots. His mom read this book after I told her to and both of us implemented the plan. In two weeks time he was eating all food put in front of him and asking for seconds - even on carrots!
2,Maybe for the collector of all things Miley...,"This video does have a pretty thorough telling of Miley's story, but the video quality was astoundingly, oh, there's so many ways to say it, but I'll just go with BAD. It looked like it was filmed with a cheap camera recording a broadcast on an old T.V. The audio, except for the narrator, sounded like it had been given a heavy dose of auto-tune. I also took exception to some of the editorial statments such as ""Dolly Parton's blond bimbo image"". Voluptious, sexy, yes. Blond bimbo, no. If you just have to have everything Miley, get this, but don't bother watching it. Oh, I watched the HM movie immediately after this and the audio and video were beautiful, so it's not my equipment, unfortuantely. Cheap video, still not worth the price IMHO."
2,Creative Homeowner - Not,"I have two ""Creative Homeowner"" books and they have both proved useless in helping me design my remodels. I am an advanced DIY'er and I need the kind of information Taunton includes in their books. Not just a glossy photo of a finished room, but design trade-offs, how-to's, material options, etc.These books should be called ""Wealthy Homeowner,"" because they just provide glossy photos for the very rich to show their interior designers and architects."
5,Sumptuous,"Wow, what can I say. The entire book is a roller coaster of fun and debauchery; it is both a cautionary tale and a Hunter Thompson-esque romp, filled with delicious wordplay, keen observation, and wicked silliness. A wonderful first effort; I can't wait for Mr. Bartone to surpass it with future tales.I strongly recommend it. Be prepared to laugh out loud, while simultaneously cheering and pitying the characters."
2,"Water, Water Everywhere and Hardly a look at Cornwall","Purchased for my grandmother (a devout Cornwall resident until she moved her young family to America after WWII) to reminisce and show off her heritage to new nursing home friends and caretakers. Her response to the viewing was flattering of its music and photographic qualities, but she wondered what happened to showing off the beauty of Cornwall's villages and historic locations. A final criticism was she hoped I hadn't paid much money for it as it was just water, water, everywhere, and made her want to use the facilities by the time it was over."
3,not quite what I expected,"I was anticipating something with more extensive and varied views of Cornwall. The photography is excellent and apparently is representative of the scenes that mean the most to the artist, but if you are looking for something that shows more of Cornwall with a broader sample, you will probably feel that this falls short."
2,A very attractive book cover,"After 30 pages of unpleasant characters and murky explanations of how they were connected, I gave up and returned this one to the library. This was a classic case of judging the book by it's attractive cover and cutesy title. If the previous books in the series were better, then I am sorry that I started with this one. There is nothing really horrible here, just nothing that compels the reader to invest much time."
3,Complicated and confusing,"Bed-and-breakfast owner Judith Flynn and her husband Joe are tired of hearing their neighbor Rudi practice his violin in their cul-de-sac. When Rudi's mentor, Dolph, comes to town, he chooses to stay at the B & B. Things get hectic soon as dead bodies begin to appear and a priceless violin bow and cousin Renie's credit cards begin to disappear. The relationships between characters are complicated and confusing and by the time the book ends, it's hard to tell who did what to whom. I agree with some of the other reviewers who wrote that Judith's mother is too mean-spirited to be funny and cousin Renie is pretty far out with her nasty temper and devotion to a stuffed monkey whom she treats as a human being.Perhaps it is time to retire this series."
2,Hip surgery,"Really am angered about the way the author protrays people with artifical hips. I suppose there are some who may have post op problems, but the majority of us can do perfectly normal everyday things after hip surgery. I walk well, play golf, garden,do aqua aerobics and also can get down on the floor and back up again without help. Her references to her inability to perform everyday tasks in this book I find quite irritating. It gives the impression that if you have hip surgery, you are going to be crippled. Not a good image to give to someone who is contemplating such surgery. This book really isn't as good as some she has done before."
3,ok,I think that for the year that this was made and the low tech that it is a interesting game. I bought it mainly for my husband; so i dont play it but he seems to like
1,Not my cup of tea.,I bought this book based upon good things I had heard about the author. I don't know what planet these people were from but certainly not the same one I inhabit. The story never seemed to take off in any concrete direction. Sorry Ignatius lovers. He's not for me.
3,Great Writing...Little Action,"Okay, I've read all the reviews here that give this book a 5 star, and I just can't understand it. In the book's favor, the writing is very good and enjoyable. But, after about 200 pages I was still waiting for something to happen. It just drags on and on without much action.Finally, things come to a head, and the second half of the book is much better than the first half. I would recommend reading this book, but with the caveat to not expect a whole lot in the first half of the book."
3,Central Theme Flawed,"Compelling spy novel, and very realistic, it puts you right there, but in the end the central theme is flawed. The Israelis/Americans are not the same as the terrorists of the world--there are definitely two sides out there, one with good guys and one with bad guys."
4,David's Early Work,"This is David Ignatius' third book I've read now. I started with ""The Increment"", then ""Bloodmoney"", and now ""Agents of Innocence"". I always learn something about the CIA and how they operate around the world when reading David's books. The stories allow you to connect with the characters on an emotional level. This book was my second favorite of his, right behind the Increment. He jumps ahead at the end of the book to show us what happened to the main characters. I felt a bit empty at this point; like I'd missed a lot of the story. I did enjoy his descriptions of Beirut and how it was during it's ""Hey Day""! Overall this book is a very enjoyable book to read. Like most of David Ignatius' work; once I pick it up, it's hard to put down!"
5,An Amazing Read,I thought this was a fantastic book and agree with others about the letter at the end. I think that letter speaks volumes about our current situation in Iraq. Was David Ignatius a CIA officer before becoming a great author?
4,Super Mario Bros 3,Super Mario Bros. 3 [Online Game Code]I rated this game with 1 star because I could not play it. (it was hard for me) but if you are good at Super Mario I think you would enjoy playing it. So Overall I rated 4 stars. I am still trying to get over the 3rd step. If you buy it you will have fun. Enjoy.
3,"Before, I gave this game less credit...","I feel that when I wrote that review and gave it only 1 star that my mind was thinking more about games like Specter and Super Mario 2. But this game deserves more credit. For one, you can carry more than one power up but you can only use that power up in your ""power up holder"" on the level screen. The levels are fun and challenging, but gameplay can get bland, repetetive, and painstakingly long. That is why it needs a save feature. Even if you can beat it in one sitting, you'll feel it tommorrow morning. Probably the best part is two player mode, but I rarely have another player. There isn't much to say. This game is unlike the first two and can be pleasing."
1,cot charged but never received this item,I would not recommend buying from this seller. I ordered the game on Feb 8 2011 and never received it although I was charged on my credit card for it. I am very disappointed with the entire situation.
5,My favorite out of any Mario game,This was probably the most popular of all the Mario games why it was the was shown on a crappy movie the Wizard got a Saturday morning cartoon. This is a hard game on a few occasions you get power ups that were like a frog suit bear suit a flying racoon type power up of couse a fire power up this is a long game but very fun and is the best by far of any Mario game. I play this on an NES before but really love the All Stars version of it too. But this is the best Mario game ever any it gives a true challenge not like today.Just a good game from the very early 90's. Can't go wrong.
5,Great game,The game is fun to play. My wife and I were playing for fun and started to remember back in the old days where we would just run right through the game.
5,great,my grandkids love this way more than their Wii game. had this awhile and they teenagers fight over it as soon as they walk in.
5,Replacement game,"It is just as I expected...a little slow getting it started, but my old one was the same way. It is one of the original NES systems, and it is old--so I'm not complaining. Once you get it started, it is just as much fun as it ever was."
5,i like that game,i like that long time nintendo nes love mario all-time~!!!! i wish that nintendo will release new similiar games so I can buy them and play them so I can refer my friends to them.
4,"good, but not great","Its a pretty good game, but some parts just make you so mad! But its a nice edition to the mario series. A good game for the NES."
4,retro gaming,"game play is exactly how I remember it if you liked it then, you'll like it now. graphics are a little clunkier than I remember might just be me though"
3,The place for house churches in the 21st century,"Steve Atkerson and his fellow writers in Ekklesia attempt to make a case for the role of house churches in the 21st century. Surely, they have a place but should they be viewed as ""the solution"" to some problems in the instititionalized church of today? My understanding of a local expression of The Body of Christ is it can be anything it wishes to be as long as it is true to Bible truths. I say that to say this,there is more than one way to address the issue of churches that are falling be what God has called them to be.The housechurch may be one way, reforming the church another.There are many ways to gather together and cooperate as followers of Jesus as Christ as a local expression of The Body of Christ. This book falls to acknowlegde this.danny bouysou, MRE86,New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary"
5,The complexity of family life,"Remember Ordinary People and it's stunning debut into the literary world? Well, here's author Judith Guest again with Errands, another great book about the complexity of family life. This time it's a young Midwestern family facing the death of the father. The family is so undone as their lives crumble that at times I was tempted to stop reading. If you are, too, gear up and stick with it; you'll be glad you did. Slowly, slowly, Guest allows us to watch their gradual return to a level or normalcy.Judith Guest has a particularly good ear for dialogue, and in this book she reveals this talent best when siblings are fighting.Great read."
5,A wonderful story!,I had first picked this book up at the library because we had to do an old-fashion book report in my Honors English class. I finsihed the book in three short days! The story was so amazing and such a tear-jerker. I hadn't cried over a book ever since Patricia Hermes' books. This books shows just how long it takes to get over grief. I loved that Ms. Guest wrote from the kids' as well as the widow's point of view. You really felt for every one of the characters. I recommended it to everyone I know.
4,Realistic,"This book is based on Judith Guest's paternal grandparents. Judith Guest's grandmother never admitted that her husband was ill and he died when he was young. In ERRANDS, Annie Browner turns to her sister for support, just as Guest's grandmother turned to her sister for support. I have been reading many of the reviews and I can see that a lot of people find this book very realistic. As you can see, this is the reason why. I found this information in an article when I was doing research on her for a Minnesota Author project."
3,Very realistic,"I liked this book because it was so realistic, and the characters so ordinary (I like plain and ordinary things). I especially liked the ordinary-ness of the adult romantic relationships, such as the portrayal of sex between loving married partners with 3 active kids. However, this book lacked the ""oomph"" that would make me go back to it again and again. There is no deeper message to it than simple storytelling. It's a good read for passing the time, not for discovering humanity."
3,sad but probably realistic,"I found the book to be quite melancholy much like Ordinary People. The characters don't so much overcome the tragedies in their lives but instead they succumb and then learn to deal with them. As a working mother with two teen-aged boys, I believe it would be possible to be so overwhelmed with responsibilities that you simply have nothing left to give, even to your children. I can't imagine what it would be like to be without my husband to share in the parenting responsibilities with my boys. Living both in the Detroit area and now on Lake Huron, I too was able to identify with the locations in the book and found that enjoyable. Not something you want to read when you are feeling blue"
3,Tedious,I found this book to be somewhat disappointing. The impact of death within a young family is certainly an interesting topic but I was bored by the focus on the mundane. Often there was lengthy dialogue that was unenlightening and everyday. If that was part of the point of the book- that the mundane goes on after a drastic event- the literary presentation was a bit too dull to hold my interest adequately.
4,works fine here..,"Not sure of the complaints, works fine at my place, hanging on the far side the shower from the faucets but still gets wet, no issues. Plays fine, battery life is pretty good but I had spare NiMH 'C' batteries and use those to safe the $ of alkalines."
4,Damn Good,"Although I have never heard the whole CD Remy got my attention with ""Take A Message"". And anyone who doesn't like the song needs to check that nasty attitude athe the door! And that's true story. I think that if you give this album a chance then you'll be very Pleased!! Especially if you like (LOVE) jazz!"
5,Awesome product...but also an awesome Target!!!!!,"I love this GPS unit, I used it every day and it (almost) always got me exactly where I wanted to go. But a serious warning to all you owners and potential owners out there, DO NOT leave the unit or even the mount for the unit on your dash or windshield. My car was broken into and intentionally targeted because I left the suction cup mount on the windshield. They broke a window, and tore the car apart until they found the GPS unit locked in the glove box. If they know it's there, they'll break into your car, and take what they want. Great unit, but keep it hidden unless you're using it!!!!!"
2,Good but not great,"I've had my Garmin now for ten months. I'm a real estate photographer and use the device daily to find my appointments. The maps are outdated by about two or three years, so once in awhile, I need to check my map book to find a property. Also, after several months, the touch screen becomes iratic. You can touch a ""2"" and the number below the ""2"" will be chosen. This often happens if the Garmin has been left in the sun for an hour or so, but sometimes the heat of the sun has nothing to do with it.Other than these two major problems and the fact there are flaws in the routing from time to time, I have used the Garmin with little difficulty over the past ten months.I mentioned the touch screen problem to a sales guy the other day, and he agreed Garmin has this problem. So, I'm guessing it is a continuing source of frustration for owners.I like my C330, and it performs well under most conditions. However, I doubt I would buy a Garmin again when this one fails."
4,Works great for most things...,"The c330 works great for getting in and out of unknown places. I went to CT to a Hatter and it brought me right to the front door.I love the audible feature. I can get into songs on the radio/cd player and it beeps and tells me my turn is coming. That is great for absent-minded people like me.Searching for restaurants and other stores, churches, etc. is another great feature.I also love that is comes preloaded, because I work on an Apple computer and would have to visit a friend to load data.Unfortunately, when I was faced with a detour because of a parade, it was a little less helpful. I had to guess how far to detour out of the way. I ended up going to a dead end street that it thought was a through street.Most of the time, it is fantastic, but just realize that there are limitations.There are many pluses and only a few minuses.I found it to be a great value."
3,Early disappiontment,"I decided to purchase the c330 based upon many positive reviews supposedly written by other satisfied customers. The unit did arrive from Amazon on schedule. The ease of operation and graphics are outstanding (I am electronically challenged) as others had mentioned. However, in test runs in our neighborhood, the unit twice attempted to route us on roads that have been closed for 10+ years. This, of course, would be a major problem in an unfamiliar area at night. Also, the local Applebee's was shown as being 0.5 mile from its actual location. We plan to take a trip of close to 1000 miles this week. If my opinion of the actual navigational value of the unit imporves, I will submit an amended review."
4,Garmin 330,"On my first long trip, the unit died. I tried everything to get it working such as hitting the reset button, trying to operate it with and without external power and constantly turning it on and off. After about 8 hours, the unit started working again and has been fine for the 1 1/2 months that I have owned it. When working properly, it is a fantastic piece of equipment."
4,Where in the World Am I?,"An excellent tool to figure out exactly where in the world you are and how to get to where you want to be. I've used the Garmin c330 in a number of different states now. As an attorney, I often need to be at a courthouse at a specific time in an area that I have never previously traveled. I take my Garmin and it always gets me where I need on time. Just typing in the address where I want to go to from my hotel, car rental, or the airport gives me an immediate update on how long it will take me to get to my next destination and how to get there. I love the recalculation feature which assists you in recalculating your trip should you miss an off ramp or need to take a detour."
4,Garmin Street Pilot 330c,"I purchased this unit in early Dec,2006 and I am still getting use to using it.I wouid like to see Garmin provide a manual with the unit.It comes with a one page guide which is user friendly and there is a wed site,but I would have prferred a manual.I have heard this from two other people,so I believe it's not just me.The only thing that is confusing so far is when you put in a location,it will give you the milage to your destination but it is as the ""crow fly's"".It's a straight line,if you go to the turn by turn menu and go to the very end it will give you the true milage(you must click on it).I learned this from a Garmin rep.Over all it is a fine product and would recomened it to my friends."
4,"Seniors, pay attention. Never be lost again","Great for any user. I would recommend that for those areas who do not have a street address, that a provision be made where you can, after you reach a place set a location (e.g. Duke university hospital parking area). In my recent visit to Atlanta Georgia, it worked flawlessly in an area where I got lost every time. Great job, Garmin."
4,Garmain StreetPilot,"easy to use right of the box. Street detours are a bit of a challage and having a strange voice speak directions to you while you are driving takes a bit of getting used to.All in all, the StreetPilot is a great value."
3,Could be better,"While using the product in Florida recent;y, I found that it very often claimed that it lost the satellite signal.This was, to say the least very annoying and detracted from the utility of the product. When itkept the signal, it was right on and the voice feature was a definite plus as you didn't haveto take your eyes off the road to follow directions."
4,Right out of the box,"Very easy to use, right out of the box. Very intuitive menu system and easy to use touch screen. If you want a very simply GPS Nav system, this fits the bill. There is no desktop application to speak of, which I would have liked and you only get two warnings about turns, one at the very last minute and I missed a turn or two at first. I'd like an intermediate warning, but that comes from having used another system. I got this for my son who gets lost all the time and calls me for directions - at all hours - and it has made a hugh differernt in both our lives."
3,Garmin StreetPilot c330 Vehicle GPS Navigator Review,"The Garmin c330 is functional, but not exceptional. Complaints include it does not give the fundemental data expected like time to destination, current heading (problem only exists when navigating). It does provide the expected arrival time and you can calculate in your head the time to destination. Other essential data such as distance to go is provided ona second screen that you need to toggle back and forth to. I had a TomTom One (returned) which has much better features, but the navigation was poor. The Garmin's navigation is pretty good. I would probably try something different rather than purchase the Garmin again."
4,Garmin StreetPilot c330 GPS,"For the money I don't think you can do better than the Garmin c330 has to offer. I purchased a couple and returned of others prior to coming back to this unit and for ease of use and accuracy, nothing beat it. The only knock I have on it is it's size compared to some of the others with the same size screen. It would be much easier on air travel if you could pack it away in your laptop case like some of the others. I recently used it on a vacation which involved several moves to different places on the west coast and this thing is a super time saver, not to mention the tension of plotting out your trip and trying to make heads or tails out of those internet provide driving directions."
4,small issues,"I recently purchased the Garmin c330 for my wife, who is directionally challenged. It was very easy to set up, basically just a few minutes out of the box and it was done. The voice prompts are clear & concise and the volume is easily adjustable and loud enough. If you miss a turn, the unit tells you it is recalculating and gets you back on the right track. The screen is nice and large, and didn't wash out in bright sunlight. Now to a couple of small problems. I typed in Pizza Hut, and it gave me about 10 different Pizza Huts. This was wonderful, except it missed the one closest to me. This is a Pizza Hut that has been in the same location for years. I don't understand how it wasn't picked up. I put in an address for a building I was looking for. As I passed it, the Garmin informed me that I had 0.3 miles to go. I am mostly happy with this product, although it has me scratching my head sometimes."
4,Easiest I've found,"I had one of these for a few years and it was stolen, so this was a replacement. I like it's simplicity, although it's probably considered a dinosaur at this point."
4,Pretty Good !!,"Pretty good for the reduced price I paid, but wish I had paid more and received an upgraded product."
2,"Old maps, discontinued item","Returned mine last night. Maps were 2 years old, and Garmin would not update them. Picked up TomTom 1 3d edition, and could not be happier."
1,Had to send it back.,"Like so many I booted it up and received ""Can't unlock maps"". Called Garmin and was told to send it to them for service, that it was a factory defect. Don't think so. I sent it back to Amazon for a refund. I liked the unit and wanted another one but apparently a lot of their stock is like this. Guess I will look locally so I can test it in the store before I leave. It will be worth the extra cost. I can tell it would have been a nice unit if you get one working out of the box."
2,"Great GPS, Out of Date Maps Cause Lots of Frustration","I just picked up my second Garmin c330 from Wal-Mart on Black Friday for $128. My wife and I love the GPS and it's good enough for most of what we need it for.The one, and in my opinion, really bad downside is that the maps are approximately 2 years out of date. Further, in buying the unit, it requires a $70 update each time you want to get ""current"" maps. If that wasn't bad enough, the $70 map update that claims to be ""2008"" is still missing large chunks of roads and places that were opened up in early 2007.Even if you buy a brand new unit, you still get old maps AND Garmin does NOT give you any sort of free updates on the c330.If you live in a fast growing town, I'd look elsewhere for a GPS with a better system for updating maps and keeping your GPS current."
4,Does the job great!,This thing is awesome! Works great and easy! It's an excellent investment for my work. Only thing to note is there have been some incorrect or not up-to date maps. but I still never get lost.
5,Incredibly Pleased,"This is my first GPS purchase and I am blown away with the overall quality and features of this product. It does everything the literature says it will do and a whole lot more. The accuracy is impecable (much smarter than I am) and the features are everything I need in a GPS system, e.g. detour selection, rerouting, points of interest, trip data, short boot up time, and very extensive mapping capabilities. I am extrememly satisfied with this unit. Sure there are other units with more bells and whistles but if you want a core product with outstanding accuracy and all of the necessary features, you can't go wrong with this one."
3,Lost in Memphis,"My wife is normally my mapping system, but I cant always bring her along. So when the mapping systems became less than $400 I bought one for when my wife isn't around. My friend Mark has a TomTom that I must say I like better.... it tells you not only when you will arrive but how much driving time you have left. It also lets you NOT travel on certain roads when the Garmin only has a vauger DETOUR button. I still love the Garmin though.... but, if I were to buy one now I would get the TomTom.-- Howard D."
1,DOA - very unimpressed,"I'm very unimpressed. I'm sure this thing is nice when/if it works as advertised but my unit was essentially DOA. It is unable to access the map data (""No Map Data Available"") and after a 15 minute wait to technical support in Garmin I'm told that it's just unable to get at the hard drive in the unit and that I have to exchange it. Which means staying home from work yet ANOTHER day to accept delivery.I was really looking forward to using this, but these days I feel like you simply can't order a piece of computer-based electronics and expect it to ""just work"" without calls to technical support, or exchanges.It's going back... I'm probably going back to maps and Mapquest."
1,not happy,"I ordered the Garmin gps and never did get it. All I got was the run around. I am not happy with the service and the comments that I got from Amazon. This item was to be a Christmas gift, thanks to Amazon it never came and I keep being told it was on the way. It was my mistake to believe them and miss the Chirstmas delivery.I cancelled this item and bought an item at a dependable store.I believe this item was oversold by Amazon, and that no intent to deliver the gps was ever in the mix.Next Christmas this will not be the case."
4,Problem with credit card payment,"The Amazon web site told me that if I signed up for their credit card I would receive a $30 discount on the price of the Garmin. So I duly signed up but could not get the site to accept payment via the card.I was obliged to use another credit card and so was unable to take advantage of the amazon card discount.If the site had warned that it takes x days before thier card can be issued or used, then that is fair and above board. But there is or was nothing to indicate that applying for their card and buying a product with it on the same day is not possible.Since the date of the purchase early in March, I have duly receive this Amazon credit card but will not use it because of the disatisfaction that I now have with an otherwise great Web seller!I believe that Amazon was careless if not deceptive by not telling the whole story. So beware lest you make my mistake and trust all that you see on the screen! Do you hear me, Amazon?christopher"
1,No Lat/Long?,"Fine if you want to just drive around, but if you have any intention of getting a Lat/Long from the device -- forget it. Which brings me right to the point: what's the purpose in having a GPS if you can't tell where you are?"
1,A real POS,"This product totally sucks and the support bites harder since tech-support is unavailable after hours and on weekends. For a start...WTF is with ""cannot unlock maps""?? Who does their quality control at Garmin???? There is no quick support since the Garmin website only tells me to pack it up, get an RMA (if their tech support people can be available to give you one) and send it back to their tech support center so they can pry it open and damage it even more? There is no straight answer as to why there is a USB connecting to this excuse of a GPS. The manual is useless and can be used for toilet paper. I rate this minus 5 stars since it a useless paper weight. I am returning this crap ASAP and going to buy a Magellen. To all those who rated this product well....I believed your lies."
4,Garmin Street Piolot,I'm a Home Health Nurse and this device has saved me many hours of agony looking for my destinations. Thank you.
4,"Good product, but maps could use updating","I like my c-33o, but have been disapointed with the accuracy of the mapping data. I contacted Garmin and was told that my Street Pilot is as up to date as possible. This leaves their data a little old. My c-330 was not able to find businesses in my area that are at least three years old. It also has chosen cross country routes, in ""Fastest Time"" mode that turned out to be impossibly twisty mountain roads, adding an hour to our travel time. Apparently it's data does not take multiple hairpin bends into account. Things I like are its ease of use and the fact that I can set its commands to be in an English accent. I just wish it had better accuracy with its data."
5,BEST ON THE MARKET,WE THINK THE GARMIN C330 GPS NAVIGATOR IS THE BEST ON THE MARKET. WE TRIED TWO OTHER NAMED BRANDS AND RETURNED THEM IMMEDIATELY. THEY WERE SLOW TO RECALCULATE AND DID NOT HAVE LOTS OF THE ADDRESSES WE LOOKED UP.THE GARMIN HAS BEEN RIGHT ON TARGET AND WE RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO NEEDS ASSISTANCE IN GETTING AROUND.
5,Garmin-Expanded my horizens,"I am one of those people born with almost no sense of direction. I can get turned around in the building I've worked in for two years!. When I used to travel to new places, I always armed myself with maps and driving instructions and still managed to get lost driving the freeways of Northern California. Since losing myself tends to make me very anxious, my driving to new places diminished. With the Garmin, I have become adventurous and now drive to new places all the time, confident that if I miss a turnoff, Garmin will get me back on track. Best investment I've ever made."
4,"Not perfect, but good!","My first GPS. Very easy to set up and operate right out of the box. Adding favorite locations also a snap. Can be a bit confusing where several roads merge, but if you pay attention and don't turn early it takes you where you want to go. Helped my wife find her way around Detroit at night quite well. One trip in mid-Michigan I used a map going and the Garmin coming back. Trip home was 20 minutes longer in a round about way that took me on dirt roads -- not good. Wasn't the shortest or quickest. But, on the other hand, it did get me home. I recommended it of one of my friends and he thinks it's wonderful. I'm anxious to try it when we go to Orlando in February."
4,Addicting,"This is the most useful toy I have ever had the pleasure of owning. It's addicting like a calculator where you start letting yourself forget your multiplication tables because you know you have your TI80 in your pocket - same with this gps - you don't even have to think about directions anymore, which is useful when you are on the road as much as I am."
4,Great for delivering Pizzas,"OK so i bought this this when i started working at papa johns like 2-3 months ago and it has been my best friend. Works great, 4 stars kuz every once in a while on a main road it will tell you the address is not were it is relly and u ahve to actually think about were you are. that might be because of my messed up town. (use british accent its erotic lol jk)"
3,Could not detect satellite signal in Portland Oregon,"Garmin C330 behaves very well in California. But when I brought it to Portland Oregon, it could not detect satellite signal in a car. I needed to bring it out of the car to get the signal. I then attached it to the windshield. Unfortunately it lost the signal again. It behaves the same when I was in a freeway without tall buildings nearby. After many tries, I decided not to use the unit in Oregon. I have sent an email asking helps from Garmin supports. They asked me to upgrade to a newer firmware. But when I asked them whether the new firmware could really fix the problem, there were no responses. I guess I'll know whether the new firmware works when I go to Portland next time."
5,Garmin GPS,I think everyone should own a gps ... sure makes finding your way around alot easier. More hands free.
3,Garmin c330,Well I got the GPS. And they called me to see if it was ok. They said they would send me the CD that gose with it. Have not received it as of yet?? But over all I guess it was a good buy.. The biggest problem I had was it smelled like cigarettes smoke!! Yukkkkkkkkk
3,StreetPilot C330 has ups and downs,"I am not completey happy with my new C330. The battery charge life is to around 4 hours and the automobile Integrated DC power cord does not seem capable of operating the navigation device. However, ease of operation (when operating) is a plus. For this I give my Garmin StreetPilot C330 between 3 and 4 stars."
1,Garmin c330 GPS,"I was very impressed with the c330. It is easy to use, and as far as the mileage indicated, it is more accurate then my odometer for distance traveled. Only two minor issues, it on occasion wants to take me on a route that I don't care for to my destination, but I can get round that. The distance from point A to B appears to be as the crow flys. EG. from my residence to an address in Lincoln, Ne. it shows 49 miles. I know it is 72 road miles. Not a big problem really."
4,C330,"Got the unit on Nov 8th 2007. Awesome product. Very easy to use. Maps were outdated. Tried to look up some stores that were there for at-least 2 years and it didn't find them. Called Garmin about the maps and they told me that the c330 was discounted because it is a discontinued product. I ordered the latest maps for $35 after I told them that I was not informed about the outdated maps on 330. I tried it out on a route that I am familiar with and it guided me to the destination accurately. The voice prompts were adequate. Even though it doesn't say the street names, it does repeat when to turn multiple times so it was not a big deal for me. Get the c340 instead. You will get free upgrade."
5,Directions without any problems,The Garmin is a simple and accurate GPS and my son is extremely happy with the unit. It was delivered as promised and in good condition. Another great job Amazon!
4,This GPS System is Great!!,"I love this GPS unit. I have traveled thousands of miles with this GPS in my car and I haven't gotten lost yet. However, I must say since it is a slightly older model, you would want to update the maps. Since there's always new construction many places aren't in the sytem like if your looking for a restaurant. The only other thing is sometimes I am suppose to go right but it tells me to go left.. that was for a state park. The sign for the park was on the right side of the road and the GPS said the park was on the right but it was actually on the left. Anyway this GPS system is easy to use and makes for quick and easy navigation in unknown territory!"
1,can't locate satellites,"bought a refurbished one from fry's. it never locates satellites indoor and outside in open areas. I am in los angeles. had to return it, very disappointed.pro: i like the interface, it is very smooth."
5,Simply Wonderful,"The Garmin Streetpilot c330 is perfect for those of us who just want to get where we want to go. I used to be very nervous about traveling to areas I was unfamiliar with. I wanted an easy-to-use, simple to follow GPS unit that didn't get me lost. This was definitely it. There might be all sorts of bells and whistles, but I didn't want those. I wanted to tell it my destination, go, and if I needed gas along the way it can redirect me. This is a simply wonderful, simple GPS."
2,good at first,"I bought this product about 6 months ago. At first it was great in the summer, but if there is a cloud in the sky, it loses satellite reception. It does not work in the city at all. I am terrible at directions and at first i felt comfortable just taking the gps but it has failed me once and many times after that. I am going to be looking for a new one..."
1,Good luck,"The GPS is great if it works. The first one I bought said ""Cant' Unlock Maps"" I went to the Garin website and this problem is listed as one of three FAQ's on their C330 web page. Obviously, this is a big problem and not an isolated incident. Their solution, once emailed back by their tech support after five days? 'Return it for a different unit.' Amazon gave me a full refund and I bought one from a local store so I could test it before I paid for it."
5,Great GPS,"Always wanted one, but were too expensive and the delorme was too cumbersome.... now since I have it, dont know how I did without... Even got one for the girlfriend... worth every penny... really feature loaded with great list of POI... you wont regret..."
4,Worth every Penny,"This is a great product, gets good reception even inside the house. accurate device, the cons seem to be minimal such as not choosing the same route every time it is selected and making short trips a little longer sometimes, but worth every penny you won't be disappointed."
4,A Very Handy Little Gadget,"The Garmin StreetPilot c330 is the first navigation system I have owned and on balance I am very pleased with it. On two recent cross-country trips it got me where I wanted to go without the stress and hassle of trying to read a map while driving or spotting signs in the dark. The estimated time of arrival for highway driving proved quite accurate and was very useful in planning stops. The ability to ""shop"" for restaurants and motels ahead and then drive straight to them saved a lot of time. On the down side, it has taken me to a few boarded-up or mislabled businesses because the data base is not up to date. It also seems to underestimate the time you will spend in traffic and waiting for lights when choosing the fasted route. No doubt navigation systems will continue to improve, and since the price keeps falling, I predict that in the not too distant future every car will have one."
4,Love My GPS!,"I'm on the road 25,000+ miles a year on Church business. For the price this Garmin is the best thing that ever happened to my Chevy! It's probably paid for itself in the money I've saved in gasoline (I'm never lost!!!). I plan on upgrading soon and will continue to buy the Garmin brand GPS."
4,Garmin 330 is they way to go!!!!,I looked for a GPS from several web sights. All of them took me to the Garmin 330. It was in my price range and had all the features I needed. Since I used this product it has made my traveling easier through the city I live in. I'm excited to use this on a long trip. Thank you Garmin for making such great products.
4,Garmin c330,This is a wonderful help when driving in unfamiliar places -- or when suddenly forced to detour!
4,Great product for the money,I really like it. Easy to figure out. I like the internal rechargeable battery. You can test/program the unit in the house. An included power cord recharges it when not in use - no need to have a power cord hooked up during use because the battery lasts 7 hours. The suction cup fell off my window a few times (good news - the unit can take some bouncing around) until I figured out that a couple of drops of water on the suction cup makes it stick really well.
3,Garmin GPS system,"I am not that satisfied with the system, as it has sent me in circles several times. Most of the time, it works o.k., but when I needed it the most (in another state), it failed me, by sending me in circles. I unplugged it and went with my gut feeling and then found the location I was seeking. I cannot recommend it to others and wish I had just traded up vehicles to one with it built in."
1,It will get you lost!,"I was desperate for this device to work so I could find my way around NJ for my job. What a great disappointment. I tried it out for a week in areas I knew. Over and over, when I would try to enter a destination, it claimed roads did not exist that have been around forever. Then as I approached the road, it would appear on the screen- Why?? It told me to make left turns off main highways- I would have been dead if I did that! It doesn't understand jughandles and NJ is full of them. I don't understand why some of these reviews are so great. Maybe it just doesn't work in New Jersey.I know it isn't the most expensive unit on the market, but still, for $600 I expect it to work!"
4,Disappointed with the windshield mount,"Hi, the unit itself is great, couldnt ask for more. I mounted the windshield mount and it got stuck to the windshield, now it doesnt come off. I got in touch with customer support, they were very helpful and they gave me a free spare mount for my other car. Thanks. But I am getting close to sell my car, and I cant get the mount off. Who would want a car with a mount on the windshield, and what if they have some other model/brand. And then I have to buy another one. I was disaqppointed that such a small oversight on the part of Garmin is holding me back from giving a 5 star rating to this product."
2,Can't recommend,"Purchased October 2007. Stopped functioning completely May 2009.On a 350 mile trip ""quickest routing"" from Point A to point B was completely different than ""quickest routing"" returning from point B to point A. Recently misdirected to an airport which had been closed and relocated approximately 15 miles away more than 10 years ago. I have had two excellent Garmin aviation products with excellent support over several years, and was surprised and disappointed at this second rate C330."
5,Exceeds expectations - installs easily - works very well.,"After much research, I decided to give the c330 a try and it works very well. Installation was very easy and have used the c330 on 3 interstate trips and it has worked perfectly."
4,Nice,"Just received this today and am very pleased with it so far. Seems to be very easy to use. My only problem with this is that the ONLY instructions you receive with this is literally a piece of paper front and back. I cannot believe that there isn't actually any kind of instruction booklet with this. Amazon has the manual online thankfully, but when I'm stuck out on the road and not sure what buttons to press to do what I want I will certainly be inconvenienced. The instruction page given with this basically just tells you how to mount it in your car select your location and go. If you want to change settings, charge it, or just flat out get your money's worth for this an instruction manual is really necessary and I am not pleased at all that one isn't included. Nothing is explained or put into any detail whatsoever. The product would be even better if I actually knew of everything I could do with it rather than just guess."
1,DO NOT BUY OUT OF DATE DATA,The maps in this unit are not current and for you to bring them up to the latest set will cost you $70 from Garmin because they dont think they should have to update the data for free. Buyer beware!!
4,"Excellent, especially for first time gps owners","I purchased directly from amazon and unfortunatly they had old units and this one suffered from the ""Can't Open Maps"" error. GPS cust service was extremely helpful and replaced it themselves. This is one of the most useable and fun electronic devices that I've ever owned. It showed me some shortcuts I didn't know about. It doesn't always pick he quickest route, however. I've had it a few days and I'm very impressed so far. Very user friendly, easy to use and accurate. I did find that once it showed me next to the road and not on it. Another time, the directional arrow was pointing backwards. Both problems worked themselves out within 60 seconds.My purchase price was $540. I noticed right now that it's at $699 from Circuit City here on Amazon. Not sure why it jumped in price."
3,"Love the unit, not sure I like Garmin","I'm not really sure how to rate this. I love the unit itself. The interface is very clean, very easy to use, and very responsive. You can learn how to do all the basic stuff in about 5 minutes. The problem I have is that twice now, the unit has sent me to a store that no longer exists. I checked the automatic updating program, and it said that there aren't any new maps available. I then checked the website, and there was a much newer version of the map available for $69. I emailed Garmin, and assumed that they'd send me the current version for free since I just bought this brand new unit. Nope. They gave me a completely convoluted and self serving reason for why they don't feel I deserve the current set of maps on a brand new device. Very strange. Eventually they agreed to sell it to me for half price. I'm still not sure if I'm going to do it."
4,"Great unit, maps lacking a bit","I bought this as a present and we all took it for a test run. It's super easy to use and the touch screen was nice. If an address isn't in the system though there's not much you can do. For example, neither my house or even my street, both of which have been around for more than two years, were in the maps. Quite a few restaurants weren't either we noticed as we drove around, including some chain stores that had been there for a long time. On a side note, if you're a geocacher it is possible to put in waypoints to the system, it just takes a few extra steps on the computer. All in all a great unit."
5,Best purchase I have made lately,Very easy to use and works great. The voice is easy to hear and is a great help in heavy traffic.
4,"it's good, nice for my accompany to everywhere","This is my first C330 navigation, I gave this one to my son, and then I have another one is nuvi 350, both of them good anyway"
4,Garmin c330 GPS Navigator,Nice unit - does get lost on occasion. Very bright during the day - nighttimeswitch (automatic) is a plus. Easy to set up. Online update a challenge at first - however - once installed - worked like a breeze.
4,"Practical, but not always accurate.","Very helpful in many situations but in need of serious map updating. Does not recognize many new addresses within the last 2yrs, quite often there are closer/better routes that could be taken.Over all the Garmin C330 is a reliable unit that saves time and hassel of looking @ maps and plotting your your route manually."
4,garmin,I am very impressed with the Garmin navigator. My only regret is that I was unaware that this device does not announce the name of the street or road onto which you are turning. I learned after my purchase that the next level up has this feature.
5,Best Product Ever,"I love Garmin; it is my new friend. I never get lost, and the product is excellent. I can't say enough good about it."
5,Garmin C330 GPS,"Went on a trip to Springfield this last week-end and did not bring anymaps with me. I entered all my stops ahead of time. With the touchscreen I was able to get to all my stops without a wrong turn.I had a Garmin I2 before, but for a few more dollars more this unitwas much better."
3,Please don't rely on it exclusively....,"I travel alot. I thought this would take the place of the""old fashioned way"" of using maps to get to my destination.Please..please please..dont make this mistake....This GPS...ifnot ALL of the units will take you on wild goose chases if you dontfirst check out the route first. ie..not reliable enough yet.Like the cell phones and computers...nice gadgets..but if yourcar was as unreliable as these things.. you would probablystill have a horse as a back up...so buy one ...but just beware...it is still only a novelty..."
4,great GPS,I have fgound the Garmin 340 to be very helpful as well as knowledgeable. It is agreat navigation tool!
5,Good to Go,"This is an excellent product does everything it says it will do, however I wish I had spent a little more money and went to the next level Garmin which has additional bells and whistles that I now would like to have.Be that as it may I still am totaly satisfied with this purchase from any standpoint"
4,Great!!,The product works great and has the truck routes which my boyfriend really needed. Thanks for the fast shipping. Only problem was the car charger that came with the product is the wrong one. We picked up a universal one for $9.99 and all is well.(only reason I rated 4 stars)
3,"worked fine, but hard to update","This GPS has worked fine for me for a long time. But updating the maps is a real pain. No of course, new GPS are smaller and cheaper. Before I buy a new GPS, I will check on how easy or difficult it is to update the maps."
1,Good when it works -- Dies after waranty period -- I won't do it again.,"I was quite happy with the product while it worked.However, after 18 months it became unreliable and finallydied when the weather turned cold.The culprit: a built in Li-ion battery that reachesend-of-life after a year and a half or so. Bad design.I probably wouldn't mind a unit that has a built indeath timer at $149, but I bought this when it wasquite a bit more expensive.I've owned quite a few Garmin GPS units over the past10 years or so. This is the last Garmin unit I'll everbuy."
2,Did not add value,"Tried this product, based on the favorable reviews that I read, during a recent trip across the border to Canada. Yes, it powers up quickly, yes it finds a signal quickly, and, yes, it recalculates quickly. However, the unit gave us three wrong turns, twice onto dirt roads off main roads and the final time steered us off the main road and directly into a farm. After the third wrong turn the unit was switched off and I relied on my trusty AAA maps to find my way with far less aggravation."
5,Garmin c330,I travel all over and this is the best purchase I coud have ever made. If you are looking for a streetpilot I highly recommend this.
5,Great!,"Having owned 5 Garmin Marine GPS's I couldn't resist it for the price. I always wanted one for the car, I finally got it today. I set it on the console of my Explorer, plugged it in, drove off. Within a few traffic lights I figured it out. I put in partial addresses, it found them. It doesn't need to be mounted on the windshield, it picks up enough satellites deep in the car to work fine. I still haven't read the manual yet, I will eventually. Awesome unit!"
1,Great - Until it CRASHES!,"This was a gift from my father. Out of 5 identical units now in my family, I am aware of 2 of them that crash frequently. I have not talked to 2 of my siblings, so I'm not sure about theirs. The trick is to keep the battery close to dead, so you can get it to reboot quickly. The only way to reboot it is to let the battery die. 8 hours of battery life is great, until that comes between you and a working GPS.I read the reviews on Magellan, and I agree that their maps are hopelessly out of date. Which leaves me wondering what to do next..."
3,"It is very accurate, but lacks text to voice feature","I tried this c330, couldn't return as the box has been opened. Sold within a few days for $30 below my purchase price.The c330 is very accurate, but I missed more than 5 turns since it only says ""turn right in .5 mile"" instead of ""turn right on Main Street""Say, how do I mentally calculate if it is .5 mile while I am driving and the side streets are close to each other?Now, this c330 was good one or two years ago, but now it is out-dated.I purchased the c340 just days ago. c340 works with text to voice; and boy, it is so much better and let you have worry-free driving experience. When it say ""turn left on Rivera Street"", my eyes can double check easily with the street sign. So far with the c340, I have not missed a turn."
4,Garmin C330 GPS,"The C330 works right out of the box and is very easy to use.I wish Garmin would use anti-glare screens on all their models, as the C330 seems to be missing one. Other than that, this model is currently a bargain at Amazon. If you have the money, check out Garmin's Nuvi 350"
5,Outstanding!,"Well, I'd say first off Amazon had great service taking care of me when there was a price change after I purchased the unit...so I was able to get the difference back thru a refund!The unit itself is very easy to use, even my parents could figure it out with their lack of technical skills and of the English language. Was worried that this would be too tiny for you to view the screen while driving, etc, but it is absolutely fine. It also gets great reception, I never found myself waiting for more than 10 seconds waiting for things to load. Only qualm so far is that it was a pain to mount on the windshield of our SUV, due to the steep windshield design and high dashboard...but it comes with a sticky disk to mount on the dash which helps you around some state laws also."
1,Maps are old!,my dad got this as a birthday present and he already got lost twice in his own neighborhood area in 1 week time. Is there any way to upgrade the maps?
3,Not as Good as Others Think,"Having traveled with a Tom Tom as well, this one has a few problems. You cannot backspace. Thus when you type in a street number and then a street name and make a mistake, you have to go back to the number screen again and start all over. Frustrating. Searching just to get to a town, you must put in a street name. Don't know a street name? Tough. Guess at one (e.g Main St.). Being able to search for a restaurant, gas or motel is not enough. I travel a lot on business and would really like to input an airport, but if I do not know the address (and who does know?), tough. A Tom Tom does all of these things easily."
1,this is GPS sucks!!,"Nothing.. You just spend your money to buy this GPS for nothing!! When i turn on the screen, and the GPS ca't unlock maps!!! and you couldn't do anything at all with your GPS!!"
2,Garmin Get Lost,I am extremely disappointed in my Garmin....it knows less than I do and often wants me to drive in the direct opposition to where I have told it I want to go...then it yells at me telling me to turn around and I have to shut it off. I feel sorry for folks who do have a poor sense of direction if they try to rely on this product.
2,OK,I have lot of issue in loosing signels for this gps. But whenever signels are there.... works fine. I guess GARMIN needs to make there signels more powerful.....I live nearby Garmin's main center in United States but they even don't have better signels in this area...... now you know that how it can be in other area...
1,"Ordered NEW, got USED part.","The part I received had a broken seal on the envelope that says, "" Please ensure the seal was not broken before you open this envelope."" Also, the unit did not have the screen protector and had fingerprints all over it. Nice! What's up with that, AMAZON?"
1,unsatisfactory,330 was not good! It took so much time to acuire satellites! It was losing reception all the time! It started to get pretty annoying... I would not recommend!!! I returned it after two weeks.
4,Makes a great present.,"Got it for my Mom, she is not tech savvy and she loves it. Says it saved her life many times."
4,"Good GPS, very easy to use","Very good Garmin GPS, easy to use, i use this gps with Cityselect Mexico NT V2, and i never lost.but this is only for the car, the Nuvi series have more functions and is more compact, i think is best go for nuvi 250 with the same price"
5,Gift for sister-in-law,"If you knew my sister-in-law, you'd understand why we bought her this GPS. At 67 years of age, driving a 28 ft long motor home, with 3 dogs in it, with only a vague concept of where she is going, needs voice commands to reach her destination. This unit, we think, provides that requirement, and more.Guess who will be doing the programming ?"
3,it's just okay.,"Making a big move to a city like LA makes a navigator a huge necessity in my book...and although this HELPS you get there it isn't always too successful! Once you learn the route, you quickly realize how many minutes are added to your excursion because of this GPS. Also, it takes a really long time for places to load; which is okay when you're sitting in a parking lot but not so okay when you quickly need to know where to turn. In addition, it also gets confused if driving down the highway- it tells you to turn left or right like you're on the street and if you're in a neighborhood it takes you on a tour before finally getting you to where you need to be! This may be because LA is so over populated with different establishments; it makes it a bit more difficult to process everything successfully maybe. I'll give it props though- it does get you there 96% of the time. If you're a patient person who is rarely in a rush and has an idea where they're going most of the time, go for it!"
5,Excellent Choice,"I have not had one problem with this navigator. Since I am the driver most of the time when I travel, I have found that this device gives me piece of mind and less anxiety when trying to manuver my way around a city or state that I have not been before."
5,Great GPS system - works right out of the box,"This is a very easy to use GPS system. It has all the features you would look for in a GPS system and it starts working within 10 minutes of you receiving it. I have used this for 3+ months and have found it to be accurate and very pleasant to use. It has voice directions, 2D and 3D views, points of interest, etc.I received it, mounted it on the dashboard and was using it right away. The internal battery is great when you fill gas on a long trip. It even allows you to change the voice :-)I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GPS system. The sreen is also just the right size - not too small or too big. And the Amazon price is the best."
4,Garmin c330,The Garmin c330 has a clear readable screen. The audio sound is very good. The one weakness is not its base but the clamp that is suppose to hold the unit onto the base. As soon as there is a bump or dip in the road it falls off the clamp. I have had to resort to using tape to hold it firmly. There needs to be improvement of this feature. Overall I like the Garmin c330.
4,"I was lost, but now...","this is a great piece of equipment! I can't believe how easy it is to use and how accurate it is.The only thing negative (and why I gave it 4 stars) is that it was giving us a Low Battery alert all the time and shutting off. This was an intermittent problem. Recently, we uploaded the latest downloads available for it and it seems to have cleared up. I hope it is for good.What a cool invention!"
5,Everyone Should Have One,"This GPS doesn't just make me wonder why i didn't have one before, but why everyone wouldn't have one. I just moved to Los Angeles, which is a driver's nightmare, and i'm terrible at remembering street names. The c330 worked right out of the box and i didn't even need to read the instructions to get it to work. $260 to never get lost in LA is a very small price to pay.One reason i'd been reluctant to get a GPS is that i thought you had to pay a monthly subscription fee to get the satellite feed. NOT SO. You just buy this GPS and it works. Period.AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! And it comes with a cord for your 12v adapter. I wasn't sure if it included it when i bought it, but it does."
4,Satisfactory,"I decided to buy this product because of the overall good reviews i had read. I have tested it out on several trips and i found that the initial time it takes to acquire the sat. signal is in some cases over 10 minutes.However, once it acquired the signal, it was good to go. It performed pretty well in rerouting when i decided to take a different route. The voice feature is pretty loud at the highest volume and I didn't have to look at the map to follow the route. Overall, I think its a good product to start with. Other than the initial time to acquire the signal, i have had no problems with my gps unit."
5,Garmin StreetPilot,"I purchased the Garmin based on a friend's suggestion and all I can say is, ""How did I ever get along without it?""This little device has changed the way we drive and navigate to destinations. It is so easy to use, take from vehicle to vehicle, and even put it in a rental car when on business or vacation. No one should ever be without it when traveling anywhere. It comes fully loaded with the maps, so all you do is pull it into the lighter, turn it on, and stop getting lost! We drive to locations and compare the calculated ETA to the actual time we arrive and it is always within a minute or two. Simply amazing."
4,c330,"Very good product for the money. I will never be with out one. Can't imagine with the more expensive ones do better. Have used it for about 3,000 miles of travel. A few times it wanted me to go a way that did not seems right but I'm sure it would get you there. It re-calculates quickly if you go the way you want to get you there. The Volume control is the poorest feature. It's difficult to adjust when driving. It does more then the instruction manual tells you."
4,Great buy for the price.,"If you don't want to go all out on a better GPS system, this item is for you. Very easy to use and the great thing is that it comes all ready to go out of the box. Great buy."
3,Garmin StreetPilot c330 GPS Vehicle Navigator,"I used this item when I went to Texas last week (it came with the rental car) and it was exceptional item for the first 4 days.It was so conveniant. But it froze and got me lost twice, Which was horrible the second time because it took me to the international airport in Texas when I should of gone to the William P. Hobby Airport. This item is not intended for constant use (Perhaps 3 Locations every 2 Days). In Other Words, you will not get much out of the 500$ you spend on this. Perhaps you should look at another GPS car navigator instead."
2,Great Product With a Terrible Data Base,"The c330 would deserve to be called a solid product IF the database wasn't so disappointing.I expected and wanted to be thrilled by this product. And, it is amazing --- except for one important thing --- the database.I was shocked that many many of our local establishments --- fast food chains, movie theaters, convenience stores, pharmacies, etc. --- that have been around for over 10 years were NOT in the Garmin. And, some that are in the Garmin's database are shown as being 3 blocks off of the highway in the midst of housing developments and about 1/2 mile from the true location.Some newer stores do happen to be in the database. How odd.This will be a great product IF Garmin gets a decent database."
4,Best thing since sliced bread,If you are going on vacation or business trip get a Garmin (I have a Garmin c330) and get familiar with it. A GPS will make your trip 100% more enjoyable/productive.The only feature I wish I had is that the GPS unit say the street or exit to turn on. That feature is on the Garmin c340.If you need to carry the GPS unit with you get one of Garmin nüvi models. They are slimmer so they will fit in your brief case or laptop bag easier.
5,Not one regret about this purchase,"I purchased the Garmin StreetPilot c330 for my husband as a birthday present this March and he keeps telling me it's the best thing he's ever received! I researched quite a few GPS systems, but this one consistently had the best reviews even though it wasn't the priciest, or even the most recent. It's very easy to install and operate, and the directions have been about 98 percent accurate. I would definitely recommend the Garmin StreetPilot c330."
1,Disappointed Garmin Owner,"I had high hopes for this item; however, it was a great disappointment to us. I would suggest if anyone is interested in buying this, wait until the next update (which Garmin says will be sometime later this year). The maps in our part of North Carolina do not show streets which have been around for better than 5 years, and does not show improvements made to major US highways over 2 years ago. This was not what we hoped it would be - we only hope that it is true that we can spend another $50 at Best Buy and they can update the maps for North Carolina. Would not suggest anyone in this state purchasing this Garmin without viewing the maps first at a local store. We just purchased this Feb 15, 2007."
5,Great for the money,"Even though I bought this product used, it was labeled as being in ""very good"" condition. It is, and of course Garmin is an excellent GPS company, so the device works great. It is a bit older, so there aren't as many options (e.g. for voice choices), but I am extremely happy I bought this.-student on a budget"
2,Garmin c330,"Despite its quick arrival, the Garmin c330 did not come with a window mount. I was unhappy with the purchase."
4,works great,i bought this product for 30 bucks works excellent the only reason why its not a 5 star is becuase it should have came updated with new maps
4,Garmin C330 Street Pilot,"We are very happy with the Street Pilot. It has been all that we expected and more. Our only problem has been programing it to put us on major highways instead of back roads, but I think we may have solved that problem. We find it does a great job of getting you back on track when you've taken a wrong turn. We have even found streets in our area that we did not know existed. We are truly satisfied with this product."
3,touchscreen frustrating... at times,"The product is good and 80% of the time, I am happy with its performance. The issue that I face is that at times, the touch screen does not capture your touch properly and your selections go haywire. I try to touch an address that is on top of the list and the screen selects an address that is down below.... this becomes a hassle when you are trying to punch an address and the system picks up wrong alphabeets or numbers. While this does not happen all the time, but on occassions when this does happen, it is very frustrating. I havent browsed the net or spoken to the customer service yet to check on what could be the reason... probably i shd do that i guess."
4,Garmin c330,"Have used on trips and around the house and provides clear, concise instructions. It did show I was driving in the woods over the weekend (didn't hit any trees) when we travelled a newer part of the highway but overall is excellent traveling the interstates when you need to find particular gas stations, places to eat etc etc."
5,very happy with this prodcut!,"I absolutely love this little navigation unit. I moved to a new city one year ago, and I purchased the item to help me get around this big city. I use this unit almost on a daily basis and it saves me all the time. When we had a big snow storm and parts of the highways here were closed this little unit would modify my course so that I could get home even with all of these unexpected detours. My only MINOR complaint is that it is a bit bigger than other more expensive units. But that is not a really issue when you see how well this product works. I absolutely LOVE mine and would highly recommend it! money well spent!"
4,Garmin Street Pilot GPS,"The GPS performed quite well except when it would lose the satellite and become quite confused. Rarely, the GPS would get confused and send us in circles, but the roads were quite confusing as well. We would buy the Street Pilot again as we are quite pleased with its performance."
4,Excellent entry-level GPS,"GARMIN exchanged this unit from a c320 after I had problems installing maps. Although Garmin has been promising MAC support for sometime it's still vaporware as of 3/2007. In anycase, I'm very happy with the c330. The maps are clear & easy to follow and the spoken directions are a great help, especially driving at night. I suggest using Yahoo Maps or MapQuest ahead of time to evaluate alternate routes when planning trips as sometimes the directions given aren't the shortest/quickest route. No more getting lost in unfamiliar places & my wife is very happy!"
4,The Garmen Streetpilot C330,"The Garmin Streetpilot C330 is sure one neat little invention. Use it around town or on a long road trip, you will not be disappointed. No need for lengthy instructions. Most people can figure out how to use it right out of the box. No set up is required. You can set it to find an address, find the name of a restaurant, or a hotel. You can ask it to find you food by category such as Italian, fast, and many more choices. It will give you a list from closest to furthest away. Same with lodging. It will give the phone numbers of the choices too. I am a trucker and have found it invaluable to my daily job. Once in awhile it might be off by a few house numbers, but it has no problem getting you on the right street. A great buy!"
5,Simply Outstanding,"This is my 3rd GPS and is the one I've been waiting for. The system is quick to route (and re-route), and a good POI database and is lound enough to hear over the car radio. The built in battery is a nice feature, and the touchscreen in 99% accurate.Sure - it doesn't offer LONG/LATT but in your car - are you really going to need that?"
4,Great little product,"It has a much smaller screen than the navigation systems that come standard in some vehicles. but the screen is large enough to get the job done. The 3-D view on the screen is amazing, and the sound is bright and clear. I tried it out on some trips where I knew the way, and it worked each time. I tried to fool it by ignoring it's directions, and it told me that I had missed the turn, and got me back on track. The technology is just super; where the road curves, the 3-D picture shows a road curving. My only problem is that in bright sunlight, the screen is dificult to see. I might purchase the optional rooftop antenna, and move the device furthur into the car."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought the Streetpilot c330 from CompUSA in January, 2009. At $69 sounded like a great buy. The unit is easy to use, good overall quality. The first hint of trouble started when the unit could not pinpoint my home address. I found out that the unit has outdated 2005 maps, very old for cities like Orlando, Florida. I contacted Garmin's customer support. I was told that Garmin decided not to extend its new maps guarantee to an older product. The new map warranty is only good on new products! Why would new product need new maps? How convenient! Refurbish the old junk, sell it cheap, and sell the duped customer an expensive set of maps. Of course when you buy the unit they will tell you it's as good as new!"
2,Dont buy this out-of-date product,"I kind of trusted the positive comments left here and bought one new c330. To my surprise and disappointment, this product has too old maps, for some business or roads which had been there for many months, maybe more than half a year, this product does not even have any clues about them.And Garmin does not provide even the free map update service.I checked their website and the map CD kind of costs around 70 bucks. This is crazy and I have to say I was lured into buying this crap.So do not buy it until you figure out what you will do with it."
3,Some Disappointment with the c330,"Our Garmin c-330 Street Pilot arrived in perfect condition and works well. However, the software is strangely outdated - restaurants and service stations listed have been gone for years (some as many as 7 years). A call to Garmin's help line was somewhat frustrating -- the very friendly representative said an update was coming this fall and could be acquired for $75. She said the version we have was updated about 18 months ago but couldn't explain the locations that had changed or been gone for much longer than that. So we have to be happy with the maps etc. and use AAA etc. for specific locations. Mary Alice Stephen."
4,Great Starter GPS,"I've had the unit for about a week and LOVE IT. It is very intuitive and great for someone new to the world of GPS.PROS:1) Size2) Easy of Setup and Use3) Price4) Loud Clear PromptsCONS:1) No Waypoints2) Disclaimer agreement to click everytime unit powered on.OVERALL: I would buy this unit again in a heartbeat, but it has now wetted my appetite for something with a bit more features. I will likely be upgrading within a year, but can't beat the value here!GO FOR IT!"
5,good for me,I always lost the way. That's why I bought.really easy to use.I did not find any problem from this.
5,Garmin C330,"I bought this unit and took a trip from S. Texas to Las Vegas and back. (3800 miles) Didn't take the Interstates but 50% of the trip. Could not fool it. I even tried intentionally missing turns, and it sinply recalculated my route within seconds.I recomend it very highly"
1,Washout,"The unit I received was usable for a total of about 1 hour, after which the screen washed out and could only be seen at night at the right angle...maybe. Possibly a bad egg, but for that kind of money I don't like to experiment. It promised to be a great product and I was very hopeful, I was never able to find out though."
4,Garmin c330 GPS,"I would have rated the Garmin c330 5 stars , but there is a slight problem plotting a route which I travel quite ferquently. I live in South Florida and travel to Biloxi Ms. Rt 75n to Rt 10w quite often, the route which the c330 selects is not the best and no matter what I select it still puts me through heavaly traveled roads going to Biloxi. The trip back home put me on the best route. I called Garmin and they are willing to service the unit. Since I have not had any other porblems with the unit I will wait for now. Other than the c330 not selecting the best route to Biloxi I have had no other problems. Great product for the money. By the way the c330 is $10.00 less than it was one month ago when I purchased it."
4,just some thoughts,"The unit works great. It takes the stress out of going to places where you typically would require a map or detailed instructions, essentially impossible to get lost. That to me is the bottom line.Some minor drawbacks. The AC power connector goes into the mount instead of directly into the back or side of the GPS. Tha precludes you from just setting the unit on to the dask or a shelf.The voice commands are more important then looking at the screen so text to speech with the street names spoken rather than just on the display is a feature that costs more and not in the C330. If I had to do it again I would pay for that additional functionality. Having said that, this is a very useful unit and am very pleased that I purchased it."
4,Garmin products are what they say!,"I purchased a Garmin GPS system, it's not the latest and greatest, but it works well for what I need. Amazon is a great site to buy from."
5,Much better that the Nuvi,Had this one for two years. Perfect operation. Calibrates quick when you turn it on. Skip the smaller fancier Nuvi models. They suck. You will spend more time waiting for it to calibrate than driving.
4,Well designed GPS,"Pros: Very good build quality. Excellent screen resolution and brightness. Nice features. Easy to punch in destinations. Very clear voice prompts. Can customize. Very portable.Cons: Small screen. Did freeze once already, but easy to reset. Sometimes loses GPS signal, but not unique to this unit. All in all, excellent piece."
1,"bought two, one died hard after one usage","i trusted Garmin but this is really a very terrible experience with c330. My friend asked me to buy two for him and one died hard after only one usage: we tried reset button, we tried different ways of powering it up. But it completely died. have to return it for full refund. So for people planning to invest in c330, be careful and test yours once receiving it to make sure it works reliably and you can meet the 30-day return deadline if it does not work."
4,Garmin c330 GPS was a great Christmas present,Bought the Street Pilot for my husband for Christmas. He has wanted a portable GPS for the last 3 years. I'm happy I waited until the pricees came down and the technology improved. He is very happy with his present.It is very easy to use and works very well.
5,the best thing I ever bought,"I am directionally impared, This little Garmin gets me around Washing DC without any problem. the only situation I have run into is when there are several highway intersections like 495/395/and 95 the server gets a little confused.I don't know how I lived without this little GPS."
4,Great for anyone that travels for work,"This is one of the best things I have bought for myself. It works great, and will direct you right where you want to go. The only draw back I have found, you may be directed through some pretty rough neighborhoods."
4,Very Useful,"...as a tool but has some bugs in navigation.For example, the voice says turn but the map shows to bear right.Also some pretty popular landmarks are not found. I hope the software is updated often. Still saved my bacon a couple of times on a recent long trip."
4,Garmin GPS c330,"A very worth while investment for any traveler/frequent mover. Wouldn't recommend anything less than touch screen capability. Voice recognition would be best. Model sometimes slow to recognize current location and occasionally looses signal, though."
5,It cost my kids a week's worth of driving privileges,"I got the Garmin 330 because two of my boys were going to travel from northern Indiana to the Daytona 500 this year and since I wouldn't be along to be a backseat driver, I wanted to be of some help. I already have a handheld Garmin CSX60 and knew I wanted a Garmin vehicle navigator. The 330 is unreal. It's well worth the price. My kids had no problems whatsoever finding their way around Daytona. The 330 has many useful features, one of which my kids didn't know about until they got home and I had the GPS back in my hands (""maximum trip speed""). I highly recommend the Garmin 330, and my sons highly suggest users thoroughly read the manual before use."
5,Garmin c330 GPS,This unit installed easily and with few exceptions gets you where you want to go. The occasional prompts for wrong turns are not unusual for any brand GSP. This is a quality unit at a reasonable price.
5,Love it!,"I have directionally challenged. Trying to follow a map to find anything is my nightmare from hell. Family joke is: ""Mom can't find her way out of a paper bag with a map and a flashlight."" This is on top of being technically challenged as well. (Yes, I have issues:) Given my 2 challenges, Garmin has come up with the perfect solution! So perfect there is no manual to confuse me, just a quick reference sheet which I actually read AFTER I had figured it out just by playing with the buttons. So easy to use and it tells me when to turn with enough time to move to the appropriate side for the turn. Yes, there have been a few mistakes but the recalulating feature takes care of all that. This has made my life so much easier but now I have to find another excuse for being late to things....:)"
2,Not so great in Puerto Rico,"I can't comment on how this works in the United States but in Puerto Rico it isn't that useful. It does track your location accurately and it does acquire the satellite quickly. It rarely lost satellite signal. However, there were several issues with this unit. Most importantly, it does not always give the most efficient route. It also led me onto roads that I could either not turn on because they were one way, or would be dead ends. Also, when i would search for gas stations, it would show me stations 20 miles away when other stations were only a mile away or so. The points of interest were limited and some very important landmarks were not recognized. Also, it will say on the screen that a turn is approaching and how far away it is, but it will not say if you turn left or right, you must wait for the voice prompt to find that out."
2,"NO PAPER MANUAL ENCLOSED, NO AC ADAPTOR FOR PRACTICING","I still have not used my Street Pilot because I am old-fashioned and prefer reading instructions from a paper manual rather than web pages.I don't have access to web pages in my car!Practicing before actual use is important to me. This is impossible when there is no AC adaptor included. I had to order one from Garmin, which took three weeks to arrive."
4,Don't know how I got around before Garmin,"I bought this because I deliver Auction items such as furniture and boats over the eastern 2/3 of the US. I love this thing! before I'd print mapquest maps to take with me, pickup another job along the way and have to pitch the maps and try to wing it. Even without adding stops, mapquest would take me down unfinished roads, have me turn wrong, and didn't list ,many new subdivisions. I've been using the Garmin about a month now and think it's the best thing since sliced bread.Cons: Mine can with year and a half old maps so some food places and fuel stops are nl oonger there, some subdivisions aren't listed. updated maps are $70!Pros: EASY OPERATION! for the most part accurate. serves my needs well!"
4,Garmin (GPS),"So, far we are very happy with the garmin. We bought it for our trip later this month so we will know then how well we like it."
5,"Great Product, Garmin is the best!!",The Garmin StreetPilot c330 is a very user friendly device. It gives good precise dirctions and is helps get you where you want to go.
3,garmin street pilot c330,I have returned this item only because it did not have text to speech technology. I replaced it with the garmin nuvi350. It was just a little bigger then I preferred. The nuvi350 is much smaller. I would recommend either one of these. Especially for the price!
5,Excellent tool for any travel near or far from home.,I cannot imagine taking a trip especially to a new location without a GPS. My wife was asking that we purchase one for several years and I resisted the temptation to purchase a toy we would not use. I was wrong. I like it. It is especially useful around large cities where you are going to make many lane changes in a short time. The Garmin c330 advises you before you will turn or navigate to the left or right lane. If you want to see your next turn or intersection instructions you can. You will see the road with a new prospective with this new way to see where you going.
3,Good Buy,"In general seems to work well as you would see in other reviewsCouple of things to watch out for* voice directions do not say the street names, so in certain cases you need to take a look. That can be distracting and sometimes annoying* Seems to take a while to acquire satellite feed sometimes* The default suction device sucks. May need to go in for the dashboard mount"
4,...Skinhead Reggae rip-off ?,"Not very many Skins, Reggae fans (skinhead reggae, for that matter),liked or enjoyed Symarip's 'Skinhead Moonstomp' album, for few reason.One,notably... most of 'em think it's a ""Skinhead Reggae"" rip-off. I disagree, I think it's simply a revival and giving notice to the Skinhead fans.Over all,Symarip is one of the BEST, along with so many other earlier (Jamaican) artists such as Laurel Aitken, Derrick Morgan, Joe The Boss(to name a few),that gave credit to their most loving,loyal fans, the SKINHEADS.I've rated the album 4 stars, for one fact; It's not the best,it's just one of the best. If you're an avid collector of different types of music, and one of it is early Reggae... Skinhead or not... this album is definitely a must have. Enjoy!"
1,Didn't get what i ordered,"I ordered a type 2 cartridge, dvd ram, and i received a type 4. i have returned the incorrect dvd ram, type 4 for credit, with the request to have the correct ones, type 2, to be sent back to me.please help to expedite this process with factory depot. thank you for your help."
4,Sibling jealousy gone crazy,"Another winner by Annette Blair, Lady Faith is a fast paced read about sibling jealousy of the worse kind. Faith is sent to nurse the Duke of Ainsley after he has suffered what is believed to be life ending injuries. She was hired by the Duke's brother and given specific instructions in how to care for the Duke that she will later question. The Duke a man betrayed by all he loved is hanging in a state of limbo wishing for death until Faith walks into his life and begins to bring him back from the brink of death. Their journey will not be easy as they enter into a cat and mouse game to catch a madman and try to survive so they can realize the fulfillment of their love."
1,CUSTOMER SERVICE AT DEADON TOOL CO.,"The claw broke on my Woody hammer the day after Christmas. I called customer service at Deadon Tool Co. and asked for Bob Hart to explain what had happened. The person answering the phone told me Bob Hart is no longer associated with Deadon Tool Company and Hart Tool Company, he is out on his own. Then she hung up on me after I told her my Woody broke. I did not get it replaced; what king of customer SERVICE is this?"

5,Excellent!!,"I think ''Make Yourself'' by Incubus is great. First off, I love this band. That's not why I think this album is good though. Let me first start off with that Incubus has a very unique sound that not many alternative/rock bands have. Also each song on this album has a story behind it and I think the lyrics are amazing! I especially think ""Nowhere Fast"" and ""When It Comes"" are very good, recommended songs. If you are trying to look for a unique sound with creative lyrics then Incubus is the answer. All of their albums are wonderful but this one just had an impact on me a bit more. *Thumbs up!*"
5,The Greatest CD of the Century,"So Maybe my title statement is a little over-rated, but seeing as i am a 16 year old ""man"" with my horomones pulling me in more directions than my body knows how to move. This CD along with other herbal remedies has helped, in more ways than one. When first hearing this CD, you will stick with the traditional songs like stellar, and move on to songs like pardon me and drive. After you have owned the CD for a while you will realize that every single song on the CD is not only excelently preformed and arranged by the band, but the lead singer, brandon boyd, doesnt sing about ""doing it for the nookie"" or anything of that nature, his lyrics are uplifting and they make alot of sense! ... can you believe it? Believe and ""experience the warmth"""
2,A great album for the musically challenged,"If you really like catchy vocals, half decent guitar playing, and unoriginal music, this album is for you. I have no disrespect towards incubus, and no I don't think they sold out, I think they just geared their style towards a broader range of people who could better understand the things they are trying to accomplish. Brandon has not lost a gram of his vocal talents, and his lyrics are still nothing short of emotional as hell. Summer Romance, which is off S.C.I.E.N.C.E, has the same great vocals as this album, except that less people can appreciate that song because it has more than three chords. Listen to their first albums, they are so much better, and they exploit the talent that this band possesses behind bland songs like Drive and Pardon Me."
4,Incubus is Good Listening,"Make Yourself is a Great CD. I thought it would be in the likes of Primus, but it isn't. It's softer than ""New Skin"" off of S.C.I.E.N.C.E, but I believe that this is a great CD. It may dissapoint some fans as there are flaws in the lyrics."
5,This is the most important item you will ever have to buy!!,"If you are looking for good music then definitely get ""Make Yourself"". Incubus has brilliantly put together pop, rock, jazz, ska, and made it their own super style of music. The ladies will love them for their soft spots, the men will love them because they rock it hardcore. And if you like ""Make Yourself"", you have to get their other albums, ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E."" and ""Fungus Amongus."" Rock on!"
5,<-- The avg. customer review should be this,"ALRIGHT, here's the deal. Every song on this cd is unique, and each song is amazing. Incubus is above and beyond any other band out there today. The lyrics are meaningful, and make you think. The background sounds enhance the cd tremendously, especially on ""the warmth"". Buy this cd, you won't be disappointed. 1,2,4,6,9, and 12 are my favorites."
5,this is a great cd,"this a fantastic cd, every single track is really good except for the instrumental one."
2,Stick with S.C.I.E.N.C.E. instead,"I was so impressed with SCIENCE, which is an amazing album, and had been looking forward to the follow-up. Now, ""Make Yourself"" has finally arrived... but it sounds like an inferior version of Incubus. I was very disappointed. Every song on SCIENCE is memorable, while every song on ""Make Yourself"" is pretty forgettable. It's like it's not even the same band."
3,"Save your money and dont ""make yourself""","i was anticipating this album so much. science was an almalgamation of so many cool and different sounds and was so heavy that i thought i had heard the next faith no more. when i finally bought ""make yourself"" and popped it in, my first thought was ""hey,who turned off my cd and turned on the radio?"" the high points on this cd are about as good as the low points on science. songs like the everlast-esque ""drive"" (an overdone song title) and the onslaught of boring mellow repetetiveness reminiscent of lenny kravitz, one must ask,""what happened to the mr bungle-like tempo changes and the in-your-face funk heaviness?"" all lost. but i will still see them live and i still love them; i just wont stop listening to ""science"" and pretend ""make yourself"" never happened."
4,my fave incubus album,this i think is there best album as good as SCIENCE was i think this one is more mature and is better crafted and put together shows the growth of the band i think they are going to continue to get better they have good vocals and they seem to of changed there image they are trully devloping into one of the best bands of this decade
4,incubus - a nightmare,"incubus means a nightmare, that's the definition of it. INCUBUS is a cool band. DRIVE is a well known song for a reason - it's really good. CONSEQUENCE has a good beat and really funny lyrics if u actually listen. almost all the songs are really awesome...except one. this song is the reason i gave this cd a 4 instead of a 5. BATTLESTAR SCRALATCHTICA. the name sounds soooo cool, u just can't wait to listen. but when u finally do listen, this song is weird and kinda gay. well...u'll see what i mean if u listen to a sample or something. overall, this is a really good cd except for that one song. i definitely recommend it, just watch out for the battlestar."
2,Big Disapointment,"A friend turned me onto Incubus' first CD ""SCIENCE"" about a year ago. It was the most incredible music that I have heard in a while. It had influences of Hip-Hop, Metal, Funk, Jazz; it had it all. It was intense pleasure from start to finish. ""Make Yourself"" sounds like a different band. Battlestar Scralatchtica is probally the best musi on the entire CD that even comes close to the spirit of ""SCIENCE"". The overall sound of ""Make Yourself"" reminds me of early 90's grunge. The change of emotion in Boyd's singing on this CD is a bit to wishy-washy for me. Infact the entire CD sounds wishy-washy! This CD is probally good for the ladies, and guys who just got dumped by their girlfriends."
4,good but could be better,this cd is very good most of there stuff is good to listen too they remind me of bands like faith no more and live because there very light metal (no not like creed not even close) i gave it 4/5 cause in my opnion its a little too light those who want a more loud metal shoud buy limp bizkit or poppa roach if you have listened to them already and want a break get this cd it's a nice change of pace
5,Incubus- This is a great CD,"You know, I never really listened that much to Incubus a while ago because I'd only heard one song, and none of my friends had bought the CDs. Anyways, I heard ""Loser"" and ""Stellar"" a while ago, and I've gotta tell ya, this is a great CD. Not only does Incubus reach great notes in singing and playing, but they play in so many different styles, it's unbelievable. I bought the CD a couple of weeks ago, and it is already one of my favorites. Incubus gets the head start they wanted for a great career. Buy the CD, no questions asked. If you don't like any of the songs on it, then give it to somebody else. Trust me, you'll know somebody who'll like this CD. This CD is so great that anybody from any genre of music will appreciate it."
5,Best of 1999,"While many people think of Incubus as just another metal band, they are very wrong. I have enver heard a ""metal"" song by Incubus. In fact, ther is no ""Incubus"" sound. Each song is new and original. If you want something new and that will never get old buy this album!!!"
4,Mainstream,"Their first official mainstream album with tons of hits like Stellar, Pardon Me, Drive and Make Yourself. It is not as fun or humourous as their Science CD, however the song Clean is along the same lyrical style as most of the songs from Science. There is one downfall of the album, they play most of these songs far better accoustic than in this album."
2,"If you like old Incubus, you WON'T like this.","I am a huge fan of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and was frothing at the mouth to get Make Yourself, but when I put it in, even from the first stereotypical guitar riff, it was a dissapointment. Almost all the songs have lost Incubus' refreshing fast funky/hard/ska sound that made them so good.The creativity in the turntables is nonexistent, except for a few cuts (Battlestar obviously), and the unexpected turnarounds and unique but driving melodies have changed into a very typical cookie-cutter pop band with Incubus overtones."
2,"Enjoy Incubus. ""Not this time around""","If you already are an Incubus fan, be careful. ""Make Yourself"" is crap compared to ""Science."" Change could be a good thing, but not for Incubus. The skilled music writing is gone. What is left, are simple songs, with a few good moments. Overall it's just a boring album. The energy is not there. It sounds like they were rushed to finish the album. Or pressured by the record label to make radio friendly songs. On a positive note, Brandon's voice is still in top shape. But that doesn't mean much."
2,Not all that I expected!,"I just received ""Make Yourself"" in the mail and have listened to it now a couple of times. Man, am I disappointed! I bought this after having heard ""Pardon Me"" on a sampler I received when ordering some snowboarding goods. I thought it would be something like that song, and from many of the reviews below, thought it would be good. This is absolutely nothing new. The review from Amazon is quite misleading as well. Comparing these guys with Korn? What? I don't think so! There's nothing new here! What are all the people who are giving this rave reviews listening to? Have you been forced to listen to country music or something against your will? Maybe then this sounds good! Outside of ""Pardon Me"", nothing much worth listening to!"
1,Sometimes change is not for the better.,"If you liked Incubus' earlier recordings, don't get this one. It isn't the same band. They've lost their experimental metal edge and are nothing but a bad run of the mill rock radio lets listen to this and feel sorry for ourselves band. I was really disappointed when I heard this CD. But, hey, is you're into boring same old radio rock, go for it."
5,Is It Me or Incubus is awesome?,"Incubus is by far my favorite band, they r the only band that i have bought a cd that all the songs rock. In this case it was Make Yourself. I bought this a long tyme ago and still listen to it now! Next, I tried S.C.I.E.N.C.E. This was almost as good but Make Yourself is better. Heres a list of wat i think.Privelage:Ok starter, beats the first on S.C.I.E.N.C.E. 3.5/5Nowhere Fast: Great song and catchy chorus. 4/5Concequence: Good enough 4 this cd. 4/5The Warmth: Yeah buddy its all in this song one of my favs of the cd. 5/5When It Comes: Even better then the warmth. Great Chorus. 5/5Stellar: Great 4 TRL. 5/5Make Yourself: Good song. Could be better. 4/5Drive: One of the softest and coolest songs ive heard. 4.5/5Clean: This is the bomb. My 2nd fav. 5/5Battlestar Scratchlatita: What the heck is this? 2/5I Miss You: Good Song. 3.5/5Pardon Me: MY FAV. The Whole reason i bought the cd. 10/5Out From Under: Great finishing song. 4/5"
4,I loved you once...3.7 stars.,"It all seems to be standard, somewhat predictable, angry metal. There are a few surprises though -Privilege, Pardon Me, Drive, Clean and I Miss You.The rest is OK. Nothing groundbreaking, but it is a decent release from a genuinely good Rock band. Yes, I said Rock. I consider them one of the few REAL Rock bands left! ^_^bBy far not a bad release...Cover Art: A-Songwriting: B-Vocals: B-Production: A-Length: A+Overall: C++3.7 stars."
3,"Good music, but...","I liked the CD, I really did. The music was good, though it wasn't innovative enough for a bigheaded critic like me ;) The lyrics weren't very thought provoking or especially good. There was one song I couldn't stand: The first (I think?) single off the CD: ""Pardon Me"". The music was the same tired tune I've heard a million times before, revamped with a flimsy facelift, and the lyrics were pretty atrocious. ""Lately I've been thinking of combusticution as a welcome vacation from the burdens of planet earth""? Is combusticution even a word? Final Verdict: Good for maybe one or two listens, for the music, but in a year it'll probably end up at your local CD Connection as a used CD."
2,We've lost you. Farewell.,"I held out on buying this album the day it was released and I'm now just thanking myself for that. A friend of mine bought the album and played the CD for me. I was speechless...in a bad way....more or less I was shocked. I can't believe they would give up such a good thing. Their previous material(especially SCIENCE) was all original. I could never compare any other band to it. ""Make Yourself"" is just another typical album. Each song written with the same formula. Repetitive power chords, recycled riffs/vocals, energiless progressions. Incubus is making a run for the money. This often happens to bands and I expected this to happen.Good bye and farewell Incubus."
1,BLAH!!,"I was so bummed about this CD. It in no way, shape or form matches up to thier first CD. The first one was fresh, innovative, new, edgy and had a good pace. Putting ""Make Yourself "" in my CD player made me want to fall asleep! It obviously looks like they started out with a great first CD and decided to make the next couple of CDs on the success of the ballads they released as singles. Do yourself a favor and if you want to hear great innovative music from this band, pick up their first cd SCIENCE and thier ep FUNGUS AMONG US, if you can find it!"
5,Incubus Make yourself,This is one of the greatest cd that I have ever listened too. The songs on this cd are all great exept no. 10
4,"Cool, but not as good as the first","I really liked this album, but it didn't bring out the hard-rockish Incubus like on S.C.I.E.N.C.E.It has alot of slow songs, some I like, but it still wasn't as good."
4,"Good, Very good, But S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Was Better.","Don't get me wrong, but science was alot better than this album. You may think different because you might have different tastes. If you've heard SCIENCE and you haven't heard this one and you're thinking of getting this one, It's alot different! People who have heard Make yourself and haven't heard SCIENCE and you wanna buy it, then you're in for a change! I'm not gonna review each song as I usually do because I just got it two weeks ago and I haven' started listening to it until now. Actually, I'm listening to it now! Privielage sounds pretty cool! I know that Stellar and Pardon Me are the best songs on here SO FAR. i'm also starting to like Drive, the new hit. What I've heard so far, SCIENCE is better. So I recommend you get that album first. Then get this one!"
5,the greatest cd ever,i listen to this cd once everyday or every other day. i encourage anyone with a cd player to buy this cd
5,make yourself- a fantastic cd!,"make yourself, by incubus, is one of the best cds i've ever heard and i'm so glad i bought it! it is so melodic but it was a unique sound of its own. i didnt buy this cd until after i've heard most of the songs that were put out for singles on the radio like ""pardon me"", ""stellar"", and ""drive"". i really liked those songs a lot so i decided to buy the cd. it turned out to be one of the best cds like i said before. all the songs are great, brandon has a great voice and it works well with the rest of the band. the spinning by dj kilmore is superb(Sp?). all in all, i love this cd and i love this band!btw- you should also check out and download the acoustic versions of ""stellar"" and ""pardon me""..also fantastic-just brandon's voice and mike's guitar, a lot different from the cd's version"
5,'Make Yourself' go out and get this one!,"I think this cd rocks. Being and Incubus fan for some time I just love the way these guys change sounds. This has a harder sound than SCIENCE and Fungus Amongus. But the sound is still a wonderful transition from some of the earlier Incubus works. Being the 3rd Studio Album from these guys I think it is on of the best CDs of 2000. So go 'Make Yourself' go get this great CD! Some standout tracks are ""The Warmth, Make Yourself, Stellar, Pardon Me and Drive"" Also the Battlestar Scratchlactica is really cool. DJ can really scratch out! These guys have good chemistry and they add a new sound to the boring music industry! Overall if I could I would give these guys 100 stars but I can only give em 5.....GO GET IT!!!"
3,a little disapointed but still a must have album,"I was expecting a hardcore, kickbutt album...rather it is an OK album, sort of mellow. After listening to SCIENCE I expected too much...its a really hard act to follow. Dont get me wrong the album is not a total disapointment but it does leave alot to be desired."
5,Best Incubus album,"This is a great album. It has many good songs and good lyrics. Its the best Incubus album I've herd so far and you sould get his album before you the ""Morning View"". Morning View is good, but not as good as this one. Buy this album!"
4,A Nice Album,"I don't think Incubus is the perfect band for me, but I have to say that this album is a great album to have if you're a fan of rock music. I recommend listening to the album to make sure Incubus is right for you and then buy the album if you like what you here."
4,close call for explicit lyrics,"So you've heard Drive, Stellar, or Pardon Me on the radio? You'd probably think oh great lyrics, nice and sweet, so that's why I'll go buy the album or somethin' like that. Don't. Brandon Boyd wrote some different material that may shock you. Some peculiar statements for a radio Incubus fan would inclue the following: ""The bull$%&* that's been fed to me"", ""The $#@! hit's the fan (or something like that)"", ""$#*&ed up"" and a bit more. Watch out if your parents don't like swearing at all (or you). If you were in for a suprise after listening to the Offspring's Smash, Ixnay on the Hombre, or Americana, or Staind's Dysfunction, which all didn't have the explicit lyrics warning than you'll be in for a suprise on this one. But the music is pretty good, rock chorus's, nice beats, the works."
4,"I really wanted to love this album, but it was dissapointing","I am a really big Incubus fan. I really, really like ""Enjoy Incubus"", and ""Science"" for the mixture of funk and heavy-alternative, and the unique approach to song lyrics and structures. Incubus has had an energy level that excited me in a way that only happens once or twice a decade with a band. They had an intoxicating secret formula, but for some reason they changed some ingredients and the new album just lacks that energy that they displayed on the previous albums. Don't get me wrong, I like this album more each time I listen to it. But it is not the science I was anticipating."
2,fan no more,"I don't know about everyone else, but I want my money back! Fans of the previous 2 albums by incubus won't even recognize this monstrocity. This really does not sound like the same group at all. They have gone contemplative on us, it just sounds like one long boring ballad. I sure wish that I would've listned to song samples before I made this purchase. Don't make the same mistake!"
3,"it's good, but not worth it","i have am alright with incubus, and i bought this, and it's not worth $20 more. you get 2 more tracks than the regular one. but if you want some songs that are not on any other cds and still a pretty good cd, go for it, but i recommend the regular one."
4,"Better than ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E.""","I first heard about Incubus about a year ago when I heard ""New Skin"" from the ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E."" album. ""New Skin"" and ""Redefine"" were about the only songs I could stand on that CD, and after hearing ""Pardon Me"" I didn't expect too much from ""Make Yourself"", but much to my surprise, I can actually listen to it all the way through. It's a definite change from the previous album, but personally I think it's one for the better. Among my favorite tracks are ""Privelege"", ""The Warmth"" and ""When it Comes."""
3,"good cd, just not incubus","Hey, i agree with most people here: This new sound doesnt sound at all like old incubus. The new sound is still ok, but it just doesnt compare to SCIENCE. O well, its still a good purchase"
2,"boys, why start trying to be like everyone else...","did anyone notice that the first song on the cd sounds a lot like 311, or that later on an everlast(ish) song shows up? what happened to incubus. the music seems held back....and weak"
3,Not bad,It was ok. But i have heardbetter. It could have been 1o times better. Put therewas not enough love in it.
5,Mind Bending,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this album? Probably not much but I'll throw my 2 cents into the mix anyways.Although the musical talent of each member is absolutely bursting from all angles from start to finish, it was really Brandon's lyrical stylings that made this one of my favorite albums, and Incubus one of the most socially conscious bands of all time. I read review after review and I'm amazed at the number of people who don't really ""get"" what the lyrics pertain to. If you don't, I'd start figuring them out ASAP.It's hard to describe what kind of impact this album had on me... I still get chills. Absolutely unbelievable."
4,Definitly not going nowhere fast,"First off, this is a great CD. Amazingly well written songs, DJ scratches at just the right moments, strong vocals and lyrical content, and a great all-around vibe to the album. This album is what brought Incubus to the masses, and it's no wonder why. Incubus wrote accessible songs, stayed true to their influences, but developed more of their own style. They can't keep writing New Skins or Take Me to Your Leaders forever. But I have to admit, I miss the vibe that SCIENCE had. Make Yourself lacks the raw energy, eccentric songs, and varied stylings SCIENCE had. Still an excellant album though."
5,This is the best cd I've ever heard,"Well, considering I am Incubus', #1 fan, in my opinion I think this is the best cd of them all. My favorite song on this cd is ""The Warmth"" and I also like the ballad on this cd called ""I Miss You."" I think that if you are really down with Incubus and do not have this cd, you should definately pick this up. It's so good in fact that I gave it 5 stars. It honestly deserves more but, hey, beggars can't be choosers. If you have any questions about Incubus, you can e mail me at lefler@zbzoom.net. thank you."
5,Make Yourself.... Buy This!,"Hey, Pitt here, I head heard Incubus' prior album, Science and i have also heard their sampler and demo's and i didnt find all that much that set them apart from other bands such as limp bizkit and korn. I stoped listening to incubus for about a year and then i heard they had a new release so i went and checked it out...... And i have to be honest and say i absolutley fell in love with this album, they have definetley grown and progressed from their earlier days as a rap metal fusion and have became a machine of beautiful vocals and guitars all offset by thick bass lines, perfect fitting drums, and excellent turntables wich is very surprising as how other bands such as limp bizkit have tried to incorporate turntables into their slower songs and failed horribly.This CD is an absolute gem and anyone who doesent buy it will be missing out on a truley great album."
5,There's so much more than what you've heard on the radio!,"I started listening to Incubus when Pardon Me, Drive, andStellar was played on... so I bought this album out of faith that theother songs would be worth it. I'm so glad I did. The first 5 songs are some of the best songs I've heard in a while, The Warmth being my favorite. I Miss You was not something I expected but I'm definitely glad they made it. Clean and Make Yourself are good songs as well. These songs have incredible lyrics and execution. They have a distinct sound and I can't compare them to 311 (no one sounds like 311 anyway). So make yourself a fan (ha ha ha, ok that was lame) of this local band and buy the album!"
5,Incubus rocks!,"Incubus has that post-grunge rock/metal sound that I've been looking for in music. The CD, in my opinion, is a much more progressive statement than S.C.I.E.N.C.E. In simper terms, this disc kicks ..., man! It starts off a bit slow with Privilege, but highlights like Nowhere Fast, Stellar, Drive, and Pardon Me make this a killer CD. Incubus is one of those 90's hardcore bands that have an interesting sound. Brandon's lyrics are extremely deep and thought-provoking. Especially noticable in Stellar, with the low-key strumming jumping to a heavier explosion is awesome. The song means something, too..."
5,Second Best Incubus,"This is a very good album, but still falls short of the bar SCIENCE set. There is honestly not a song on the CD I dislike, but where ""Make Yourself"" is lacking is in the level of truly unique, innovative tracks. On SCIENCE, among others, ""Summer Romance [Anti-Gravity Love Song]"" is truly one of a kind, like very nothing else on any of their albums. The closest this CD comes to having a unique track is ""Drive,"" which is a great track, but not as musically unique. ""I Miss You"" is also more unique than many of the other tracks on this CD. Bottom line: Great CD by an Amazing band, but not their best release."
4,Incubus comes through again,"SCIENCE was a great album- cool rifts, phat beats, heavy guitar, catchy lyrics and even one or two ""radio-play"" songs. Incubus came through with yet another great album with Make Yourself. It was a bit more poppy and they were obviously going for an album that would get more radio play. BUT the lyrics were tight, the guitar rifts were tight, and the overall feel of the album was TIGHT! :-)"
3,"it's good, but a disapointment","it's got some cool songs like Drive and Pardon Me, but after hearingc their previous album S.C.I.E.N.C.E i expected more."
5,Brings in the greatest of alternative with a twist of Jazz,"Very Great CD! No doubt one of they're best. From the first song on you hear amazing guitarist effects and bass. Some songs are fast, others are soothing and slow. Just go out and buy it!"
3,Import not worth it,"Unless you're trying to get every Incubus CD out there, don't pay the extra money. Make Yourself is an excellent CD, and Crowded Elevator is a decent song, but it doesn't justify the $33 cost of this CD. Instead, you should get the US version (if you dont have it, stop reading and buy it now!) and a copy of the E.P. ""When Incubus Attacks"", or a copy of the Pardon Me single, which includes the song. That'll save you money in the long run, as well as leave you money to buy the rest of Incubus's line up."
3,EXCELENT cd... but definetly not worth the import,"This CD is incredible! I truely think it is the best Rock album of 2000. Everything about it is incredibly written and thought out, and everything fits together perfectly with a sound that is far more advanced from anything else thats on modern radio. But paying so much for an import version of it with ""Crowded Elevator"" on it is not a good idea. ""Crowded Elevator"" is also on the ""When Incubus Attacks vol. 1"" CD which is where I first heard it, and its decent, but definetly not worth paying an extra twenty bucks for. If you want this for the purpose of collecting Incubus merchandise, then go ahead and get it. But if you're getting it becuase it has an extra track on it, dont bother. Try to get ahold of a copy of ""When Incubus Attacks"" instead. It's got ""Crowded Elevator"", and also includes several other awesome acoustic and live tracks."
4,INCUBUS MORE THAN ONE HIT WONDER,"A great sound, different from everything else out there, yet kicks @ss/rocks!"
2,What Incubus Was,"I was very disappointed with Make Yourself. In fact, with the exception of the single Pardon Me, the rest of the album is a throw away. That may be a little harsh, but considering Enjoy is one of my favorite albums... I was expecting a lot more. The band is without a doubt one of the most talented groups of musicians out there. Enjoy and SCIENCE are phenomenal because of how skillfully they mixed things up during each song... that vitality was totally lost on Make Yourself. If you consider yourself a fan of Incubus and haven't heard Enjoy yet.... you haven't heard how good these guys are and I hope will be if they don't allow their future albums to be over-produced."
2,What were they thinking with this?,"Man, I think this Incubus album really s**ks compared to their other realeases. It falls completely short of the intensity that SCIENCE and Enjoy bring out. This album is like one continual chorus! Where are the solid beats, cool bongos, and killer bass lines? This is really weak stuff. The only song I like is The Warmth (number 4) because it at least has an interesting guitar line. When it comes down to it, there is no funk on this album and it sounds like they sold out and were trying to appeal to the masses. Hardly any mixing and scratching either! What the h***? Do yourself a favor and keep it real with SCIENCE and Enjoy."
5,An Incubus lovers dream come true,"Of all the Incubus albums released, ""Make Yourself"" is pure genius. It is wll written and the music is what we all have come to expect from them. All in all, this is one album I would recomend any music lover have in their collection."
3,Less of what you're looking for,"Incubus is the best band I've discovered in the past few years. After the funky, heavy, diverse, intelligent releases Fungus Amongus, Enjoy Incubus and S.C.I.E.N.C.E., I had the highest of hopes for Make Yourself. I haven't been entirely disappointed, but the elements of Incubus that made them one of the best acts in music today have somehow been softened and made more mainstream. Rather than sounding unique, they seem to have taken several steps toward sounding like a generic alt-rock band with their power-chord progressions and half-felt emotion. C'mon guys! Funk it up and scream it out! Let your influences and your originality shine through. Get angry that I'm not giving you a 5+ star rating. I have to admit that some of the hooks on Make Yourself are possibly their best ever, but surprise me. Build up to it. Throw in a touch of jazz or funk or house. Bring that beat back, please."
5,Great Album,"I never really knew of Incubus before hearing ""Pardon Me,"" but after hearing the single on the radio, I couldnt help but going to buy the album to see what else they have to offer. I must say I am impressed. Although the first four tracks sound alike, they songs are still good and have interesting meaning. I thought it was creative for them to do the off-beat rythym on ""Pardon Me"", and the song is catchy. All-in-all, I recommend this album and I am glad I own it."
2,reconsidered... hasn't really grown on me,"Having been listening to this album for a few weeks now I'm being awkward and reconsidering my opinion... its nice, it has some good pieces but its a bit lacking in something, it never seems to take off. Compared to Incubus' previous work it lacks the sharp edge and innovation and i'm starting to find it a bit dull. I have no objection to bands experimenting (and well done to Incubus for doing so) but in this instance I get a feeling of the whole album being a bit stale. Incubus have proved they have potential, but I don't feel this album reflects their talent and would look more to their other work."
4,"This is not like morning view and make yourself, be warned!","Ok, so i bought this album a few years ago because i loved ""Anti Gravity love song"". If you like make yourself and morning view, this will probably be the first song you warm up to. Then after i saw them on the morning view tour they performed A Certain Shade of Green, so then i warmed up to that one. It has taken some time for me to get into the rest of the cd but when i did i really loved some of the songs, definitely take a listen!"
2,Less techno please,"Although this album does have it's bright spots, it definitely isn't one of their stellar performances. What personally turns me off to this CD is the level of ""extras"" that seem to accompany most of the songs. What I mean is that there are just too many digital samples, distorted guitar riffs, and synthesizer beats. I wouldn't say that it is over-produced, but I think that if Incubus would stick to the basics they would have made a much better album. They stray too close to the hip-hop scene for my liking."
4,its a good cd,I got this as a Christmas present (yes i know the review is a little late) and it really is a good cd. Brandon boyd's voice is beautiful and blends everything together perfectly. Its not the music that I usually listen too (ska and more upbeat punk) but its still a great cd.
1,Worst album of the 90's!,"I cant believe how anyone, especially incubus fans can possibly like this. The band went from original, catchy and intense to generic radio pop-rock. There is no heart in this cd all the vocals are boring and whiny and the musicianship is bland. No funky bass, terrible guitar work and the new DJ is atrocious. Instead of being a new Faith no more incubus now sounds like a more boring Creed/Bush combo."
2,Unexpectedly boring,"Based on the track played on the radio, I expected great things. But, no. It was a very ho-hum and boring CD. Even on a long drive, I chose the scratchy radio."
3,Decent but nothing special...,Decent band but nothing special. There are so bands out there that are just average with nothing new to say and Incubus is one of them.
2,Eh,"When I was in the 6th and 7th grades I was very impressed with this band. They could be hard, especially on SCIENCE, and they could be softer without being really lame, more like on this one. Since then I have listened to a lot more music and grown up a little. But having recently put this back on for another spin, I could remember every word, and did not like what I was hearing. All of the flourishes and crashing and stuff that I liked so much before was not so good. It seems that this band just became boring."
1,incubunogood,boring...just plain boring...a little sparkle at first glance...but plain ol boring after the second glance
1,What's the big deal with Incubus,"I have no idea what is the such the biggest deal with incubus is. I mean they are only one of the worst hard rock bands out there. They are not good enough to go on tour with Deftones. I would go to that incubus concert just to see the Deftones since they are one of the greatest bands in the world. I don't care if you really like incubus buy the cd but if you are not sure about them, if I were you I'd keep away. I like Deftones, System of a Down, old Kottonmouth Kings, Limp Bizkit, Soulfly, Slipknot, Godsmack, Metallica, Rage Against the Machine, Pantera, Lincin Park, Coal Chamber, Sevendust, Mudvayne and more of those good bands unlike Incubus. Readers, unless you are a big fan of them, don't buy this cd. Warning: Hazardous to your health."
5,Incubus Rocks!,"I used to not buy CD's because I figured all the good songs would be hits and I could hear them on the radio, but I decided to buy Make Yourself hoping that all the songs sounded kind of like ""Pardon Me"" When I played it for the first time I was so dissapointed, all the songs except for ""Pardon Me"" were bland! But after listening to it just a few more times there were only two songs I didn't like (""Stellar"" and ""Consequense""). This album grows on you like... well, I don't know what its like, but buy the album, its great!"
5,WOW!!!!!!!,"This has to be the greatest CD of all time!!!! If you don't have it, GET IT NOW!!!!!!! Every track on here is increadible!!! Every song has meaning and is expressed beautifully!!! Worth every penny. Best song is, hmmmmmmmmmmm, ALL OF THEM!!! BUY IT NOW!!!"
3,pop,this is a pop cd. good if you like pop. bad if you hate pop. barandon boyd could be a backstreet kid. dirk lance used to be awsome at bass.
1,Hold your nose when you open this bag of coffee,There are a number of things that these coffee beans smells like. Hint none of them smell like coffee and I wouldn't want to offend a mixed audience with my descriptors of the smell.
4,"It has a nice nose (Certainly not ""sawdust"", whoever said that!)","Yes, the ""sawdust"" thing is N-V-T-S, NUTS! This is good coffee with a pretty full taste in addition to the good nose. The nose has absolutely no notes of non-arabica coffee like Rhymes-With-Smafeway O-Organics (and not Fair-Trade, either). I am comparing this also to Yuban, which if you make a latte type drink with is actually excellent. Yuban is, however, not Fair-Trade coffee, and the organic version--when you can even find it, which is almost never--is not as good sometimes. Don't know why, and it wouldn't be Fair-Trade like Cafe Altura, anyway. So I'm happy. What I suspect is that what I'd want to do is to mix this half and half withCafe Altura Organic Coffee, Colombian Dark, Whole Bean, 32-Ounce Bag(4.5 Stars, 27 Reviews). I think that would be even better for me. Not sure because I haven't tried it yet, but plan to try very soon. Enjoy!"
1,STAY AWAY!!!,"1. the box arrived that I ordered for my Jeep Grand Cherokee, with Toyota Camry parts. 2. like the other review, only rear deflector came in. I will be returning some how. Extremely large box for just the small rear window deflector. Do not order..."
2,"Cute, but narrow.","These are cute shoes. But we had to return them b/c they were way to narrow. If your child doesn't have narrow feet, don't buy them."
4,Go and Come,"The author has written a book that helps children learn that going away from their care-takers is not something to worry about, because they will be coming back. The illustrator has done an excellent job is show real-life pictures. A great book to read with children."
2,Better for Children under the age of 3,"I bought this book in preparation for a business trip that I am taking where I will be gone for a week. I really thought there would be more to it besides ""You go Away"" and ""You come back"" which is basically the extent of the text. For younger children this is perfect - my three year old was bored by page 2."
1,weird fit.,i bought another one at Virgin Megastore and the fit and the quality is different. Better.i don't recommend this product.
4,another EL MARIACHI sequel,"OH boy this movie is so cool, Carlos Gallardo is awsome with the acting if you like EL MARIACHI OR DESPERADO YOU WOULD LIKE BRAVO it has lots of action lot of blood gore for a action movie,thats my kind of movie. i gave this movie 4 stars because the movie could use more american actors,only saw Carlos the rest of the actors are from MEXICO but is a good movie is a must have ....."
2,not for fans of the Josie album,"I love Kay Hanley's work on the Josie & The Pussycats soundtrack and was hoping that her solo album would contain similar energetic punk rock style songs, but it doesn't, the songs in Cherry Marmalade are slow and it seems like a waste of her great voice, fans of Letters to Cleo might want to check this out, but fans of Kay's work on the Pussycats album will have to keep waiting"
2,Mediocre Solo Career,"I really hoped that Kay Hanley would not have what so many former band members have - a mediocre solo career. But that's what this record fortells. When people say she's ""exploring new musical styles,"" what they mean is that the songs are slow and sappy. Kay is such a dynamic singer/frontwoman that it seems like she's wasting her talent. She's got a great voice, and the Josie soundtrack shows she can still crank out power pop with the best of them. But she needs to liven things up!"
3,What happened to the Hanley?,"I loved Kay Hanley in Letters to Cleo. But this CD is luke-warm..not great, not horrible. I guess its just to mellow for my taste. If you like Liz Phair, this is much better than that. If you miss the poppy punk sound of LTC then try Nina Gordon..much more talented than Kay, in my opinion!"
2,2nd Worst Indy Novel Ever!!!,"Some parts are good, some parts are ok but the rest is just absolutely awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't buy this book.Martin Caidin did a terriblr job writing this book."
2,its okay,"Way too fast paced for me. He does most of his things half assed and is not really what you want to do in a survival situation. If you want a real look at survival then hit up Dual Survival, I think these two together are the best for survival stituations."
5,Man Vs. Wild season 1,Man vs. Wild season one is a must buy for any outdoor loving man's man. Bear Grylls was an X-special forces british operative and explains and demonstrates survival skills.
2,Not exactly authentic,"If you are stranded with a knife, rope, cord, fish hooks, metal cup, flint and a striker. You'll be just fine with these tips. But the premise here is survival and most people in this situation do not have these items... So, how about be real and leave the survival kit at home and show us how it's really done..."
5,Excellent time frame,I received the video 3 days after I ordered it. It was well packaged and in excellent shape. I would definitely order from them again.GH
3,"Great show, Bad DVD set","Man vs. Wild is an amazing show that gives you insight to the wilderness as you may only hope to experience someday. Top notch.The DVDs are pirated-looking with no options at all other than play track. When you play, it starts with the Discovery OnDemand animation, letting you know these were probably not far from pirated DVDs. Nonetheless the show is great, but the DVDs leave much to be desired."
1,No Captioning,"My son likes the Man vs. Wild programs on the Discovery Channel. He is deaf and the programs are close-captioned. I bought him the Season 1 DVDs for Christmas - assuming they would also be close-captioned. They are not, and therefore he cannot enjoy them. I also bought Seasons 2 & 3; they are close-captioned. There is nothing on any of the 3 sets stating whether or not they are captioned. This is something that really needs to be addressed by the Discovery Channel. I feel cheated: buying something my son cannot use."
5,Educational and entertaining,"I try to catch the show whenever I can. It's not that I am going to go out there in the wild anytime soon, but it never hurts to know these possible life saving tips. People complain about how the show is not 'real' enough. Now I ask these people who sit comfortably at home,'Even with all the help you ever need, are you able to scale those cliffs, swim across arctic water, and swallow the food that Bear puts in his mouth?' Bear is here to eduacate and also entertain us, and in my opinion he is doing a great job."
5,excellent description of NVLD for kids needing to understand their disorder,"this book really helps older elementary and middle school level readers to understand Nonverbal Learning Disability, with particular emphasis on the social skills problems. My 8 year old who was an advanced reader had no problem reading this book, though it's geared for middle school. It explains the ins and outs of the disorder in clear kid-friendly language and helps kids feel more ""normal"" with the differences this disorder brings to their lives. I recommend it highly."
1,Hysteria at its finest,"This guy is/was a small-time preacher hell bent on scaring everyone about the 'evil nature' of rock-n-roll. A poorly written book that attempts to warn readers of Satanic plots hidden within rock-n-roll music. Haynes opines that there is an organized Satanic effort to possess listeners (especially the children). He uses weak arguments based on album covers, band names and lyrics (usually taken out of context) as a 'boogie-man' list of why rock music is pure evil. He certainly had an audience (my parents and teachers) back in East Texas during the early 80s, but now his hysterical accusations seem comical. I'm sure he made some money on this book. My KISS albums got thrown away. Today we are all much wiser and not as gullible to the author's unsubstantiated rantings. Borrow this book for a hilarious read and a snapshot of 1980s Bible-belt fundamental Christian narrow-mindedness."
3,christian propaganda extraordinaire,"This book is a great example of the more over-the-top popular christian writing of its day. As noted before, it is a great read for rock fans and very entertaining in its sheer chutzpah. He even has a page on my own personal favorite (not to mention obscure) band, Hawkwind. Highly recommended."
3,Expected more from Jumpstart,"We recently purchased this software for my son. He is in 1st grade and LOVES to play educational games on his computer. Unfortunately this has been a let down for both of us. The background music is way too loud and interferes with the voice that gives the directions for each game. It is very difficult to understand what they are trying to tell my son to do. Also there has been at least one game (maybe more) where he would do what they were telling him, but they still said it was wrong. How frustrating!So far he still enjoys playing this game, and hasn't given up on it yet. There are some good areas and I think he will get some benefit, but there is definitely some improvement needed!!Jumpstart Kindergarten was not like this at all! I really can't recommend this software, especially at this price!"
2,BUYER BEWARE!,I ordered this product because it showed on the decription that CD 4 Pet Playground was part of the 4 Disc set. I had been looking for that game for over a month and was excited to find it. OOPS! That is NOT the 4th CD. AMAZON has incorrectly described the product and my money was wasted on a product that did NOT contain what was advertised. SHAME ON AMAZON!!
2,Difficult to use,"My kids loved Jumpstart World Kindergarten - it was relatively easy to navigate, the learning game instructions were generally easy to understand, it's trivially simple to tell which learning activities they still need to complete, and they could do fun activities, buy accessories for their pets, etc. When they exhausted the Kindergarten levelswe donwloaded this 1st grade program from the JumpStart website. It is awful - difficult to navigate, poor instructions, games that claim they're wrong when they're right. It's tough to to tell which games they still need to finish. We gave up on this when I found Jumpstart World 2nd Grade (note the ""world"" in the title). It uses the same world as Kindergarten, but with more challenging learning games and different missions. So I'd recommend the Jumpstart World series, but say stay away from the Jumpstart Advanced series."
1,Not worth the Hassle,"Quite a let down. My kids 4 and 6 love the computer and educational games.Loaded fundamentals and they played for about an hour, asked for the art disk.Once it was loaded, nothing else would work. The quicktime was loaded with the Fundamentals disk, however, when Art was loaded, it ""hiccuped"" during the load and never loaded Quick time correctly. Then it wanted to register ""my quicktime"" and wanted a registration code, there is none to be found anyplace in this box set even thought it says quicktime included with install.I guess for my money (and no $20 is not that big a deal or price for a kids game) it was still a waste.Recommend you try ANYTHING ELSE before this one. I do not have 6 hours to waste attempting to get a simple kids program to load on a highly functioning computer system.Some reviews commented on background sound etc being to loud, I did not find that to be a problem, my problem related to making the system work at all."
1,NOT Mac compatible,"Although this product says that you can use it on Mac OSX, it apparently does not work if you have above system 10.2.3. Since as of May 2007, almost no one would be running 10.2.3, this makes it effectively not Mac compatible.We bought this product for our son, and he is very disappointed. I contacted Knowledge Adventure support, and they informed me that if we could only use it above system 10.2.3 if we had Classic OS Support on the computer. In fact we do still have Classic on the computer our son uses, and it still doesn't work. The available documentation tells very little even about how to install the game. I have not heard back from Knowledge Adventure regarding my second or subsequent emails. If I do, I will change this review.Until then, it gets one star."
4,slightly less than what I expected,"This roast wasn't as good as I expected. I loved Cafe Altura's French Roast's very intense (almost spicy) flavor and oiliness, which I often use for espresso. Reading these reviews, I thought New Orleans blend would be similar like the french roast, but slightly smoother. The result? Hmmm... maybe my bag could be just a less great one, but my bag had more burnt taste, less oil, and less oil means less flavor and crema. So the espresso tasted more flat, as if it is less burnt version of spanish roast. It still has same darkness as the french roast, but my guess is that the New Orleans blend is roasted in higher temp. with less time and the french roast is roasted in less temp. but longer. Still, this blend produce much better espresso than Starbucks', and since it tasted above average in americano, this would make great drip coffee."
5,Gives old vacuum cleaner a new life,I have a 15+ year old 3M canister vacuum cleaner that works beautifully... except for the hose that had become unusable. Very excited to find that I could replace the hose for much less than it would cost to buy a new vacuum. It should give my canister vacuum another decade of use!
3,"Nice idea, does not perform well",Nice product idea but hard to use.You must use with 5mm pencil.Rule is tippy and hard to control - so hard to get a straight line.For the money there are better options
2,poor packaging,"The product was advertised as new in the box. The packaging on the Incra rule was opened, torn,tattered and stapled back together. Product appeared used! I expected factory sealed packaging. I'm astonished that this product was forwarded in that condition. I also returned CMT router bits that were damaged and chipped. Are we receiving seconds?"
3,Requires TLC,"I bought several incra rules for precision which these definitely offer. Beware, they are nearly paper thin and have to be held/used gingerly to avoid bending them. One more thing to worry about in the shop."
5,great tool for us older woodworkers with bad eyes,"this ruler makes marking my wood projects a ( lot) easier ,and the precision is just as stated on your web site, great !!! The blade is thin ,but if you take care of your tools like I do it will last a long time . I was Impressed with the shipping speed and packing. The only con I have is that all the pictures of the rulers have a pencil in them , how about it amazon , throw one in with the deal. Also bought the 6"" protractor , 6"" t - rule and the 12"" bend ruler , but only one pencil , great tools and shipping thanks for making my wood working easier ,wood worker JIM"
5,As perfect as I could imagine!,A great product that makes it easy to get absolutely perfect measurements. It is a thin metal template with tiny slots for marking the project. Marks in increments as precise as 1/64. Also has scales for 32nd's and 16th's. Hold the red bar against the edge of the project and locate the slot representing the distance you need. Works with suitably thin scribes but also with a reasonably sharp regular pencils and mechanical pencils.
5,LOVING IT,"It does require a very thin pencil lead that can only be achieved consistantly via mechanical pencil. This is the third Incra measuring device I have bought and have been please with all of them. I recently bought the Incra IBOX and will be using it this coming weekend and will report on that. I am becoming a Incra fan but am still hesitant to buy their miter guage. Reason is that it does not look heavy duty eonugh for that type of tool. Still, I am happy so far with their measurment devices due to their accuracy and quality."
5,Great addition to a great guitar,"I use locking tuners on my LP Studio and I felt it would be cool to have a fine-tuning bridge. It is :)This is a solid, well-made component like you would expect from Gibson. The knurling on the fine-tuner knobs makes for a terrific grip and sure tuning. It also looks great on the guitar and is quite distinctive, as most people leave the stock tailpiece on. People ask me if it's a special edition LP...Together with my Schaller roller bridge, a very striking-looking addition and the ultimate in functionality. Five-star all the way!"
5,Alice in Chains is one of the best bands of all time,"After i bought this cd, I played almost everyday and I still play it all the time. I own every Alice in Chains cd and this by far is the best. I like the way they added a couple of live songs and a new song with all of their classics. This will be a favorite of mine for years to come!!!"
4,A solid sampling of ALICE IN CHAINS.,"The cover art is cool, but There is nothing really new on here except GET BORN AGAIN--which is a good song. This album is really like an ALICE IN CHAINS sampler. I'm not sure why IRON GLAND is included, other than to make sure the fans would know what it was called. If you are fan, it is worth having, but it is no substitute for getting the whole collection."
3,Is this all???,"AIC has been a favorite of mine since I first heard the band, but I have most of these song's CD's already. And if you're doing a greatest hits album, then why not include all the greatest hits? make a double-cd set or something..."
2,Annoying omission,"Is there anything in the CD world more annoying than a greatest hits package that's missing one or more key hits? The whole idea of ""greatest hits"" is that you buy the one CD and not have to buy another if you just want all the hits.So, why is ""Heaven Beside You"" -- unquestionably a big hit for them -- not on this CD? Is there any valid excuse for this? Certainly not lack of room -- they have the usual ""previously unreleased"" filler cuts taking up space. Now you're forced to buy another CD to get this song.Annoying, to say the least."
4,Warning. This CD Is Not Safe.,It's no wonder Alice In Chains titled this CD nothing safe...it's jam packed with all their best songs from track one to track seventeen. This is one CD that I'm glad I didn't overlook.
5,Go Get this as soon as possible!!!!,I rushed and got it the day it came out and it was worth it I cant wait till the rest of the box set comes out in the fall. They even put a little interactive thingy on the cd also which i thought was pretty cool. I am currently listening to the cd as I type and am enjoying it very well. This is great cd and rah rah for AIC thanks Layne and Jerry and the rest of you guys for awesome music!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Cha-Ching! So says the cash register.,"Aw, C'MON!If you only want to release an EP's worth of material, then just release an EP.It worked great for Sap and Jar of Flies.Making people buy the same tracks over and over is really insulting to the longtime fans.The new tunes are great but still....."
4,Admirable collection,"For the casual fan, this is pretty much all you need, and its much better than the unbelievably lame ""Greatest Hits"". However, it would've been nice to have to original studio recording of ""Rooster"", as well as the MIA track ""Over Now"" (either original or MTV Unplugged version would've sufficed). The amped-up demo version of ""We Die Young"", however, blows away the original. There's more than a hint of Metallica in this version, probably dating back to the era when AIC were still in the process of shedding their glam image and aspiring to something new and bold. Overall, their best single-disc compilation to date."
5,"awsome, just simply great...","If your new to alice in chains for a starter get ""nothing safe""a great album with 15 songs that are off facelift,dirt, and thereself titled album. you get into such tunes as man in the box(oneof my favorite aic songs) rooster live. and also one of my favorites I stay away. So basicly this cd has live,unrealsed demos and rare version of songs not incuded of all 3 of therestuduio albums.So do yourself a favor and buy this cd."
3,Ok..... but not worth it,"Lets get straight to the point..... this isn't a ""best of"" cd. This is a best of cd where they excluded some of the better songs to make way for new and unreleased songs. Don't get me wrong, this cd has some of the best songs of the 90's: Rooster, Man in the box, No excuses (one of the most played songs ever on radio). But they just happened to leave out my personal 3 favorite AiC songs. These three songs are ""Rotten Apple"", ""Heaven Beside You"" and ""Nutshell"". How they could leave out these three songs but include ""again"" and ""iron gland"" is beyond me. My suggestion is this: Don't get this cd. Instead take all of your own cds and make your own ""best of"" cd. This is what I did after returning Best of the Box."
1,Just one new song,"What kinda trick is this album? I am an inconditional AIC fan but being honest, I must say I feel deceived with this."
2,Dont like,The sleeves are long and the shirt is short. I dont know about others but that is NOT how I like my clothes.... Wont look to good with low rise jeans! At least not with my average body. I dont weight 95 pounds!
3,Slim fit,This is a nice shirt but there is no mention that is a slim fit and small which makes it extra small.
2,the fit is not like the picture shows,"the shirt is wide not slim fit and its short. it fits kinda weird. i ordered 3 different colors and they all have the same fit. not very comfprtable. oh, and the sleeves are kind of short. i'm a medium maybe if i would have gotten a small it would be so wide but it might be shorter with shorter sleeves. i'm just not satisfied. the only good thing about these shirts is the fabric but i can't really enjoy them since they don't fit comfortably."
2,not good for layering,"Great price but I was looking for a shirt to use for layering over the winter months. This was not it. Even though it has a slim fit, the seams at the shoulder poof out giving it a strange silhouette."
2,it's okay,"The original cost didn't reflect the quality of the watch. It looks very nice on the picture, but it didn't look as good as i thought in reality. The handling of the watch was poor, there is a scratch on the back of the watch. I was disappointed to see the packing of the band looks like it's been used. Overall, it's okay"
5,wonderful!,"I was looking for something to put all my dvds on, but didn't want to get one of those tall rectangle things. and this is perfect. its very easy to assemble and looks amazing in my apt. even got some picture frames in there, too! its alittle pricy for shelves but design wise its worth it and is very stable when installed."
4,Wonderful,This shelf was easy enough to put together by a 13 year old girl. It fits perfectly and is exactly what we wanted!
3,"Formica, not real wood","Just rec'd this and opened up the box to find one of those little gold oval MADE IN CHINA stickers staring me in the face - first minor disappointment. Second was sort of my fault - maybe I should have read more of the product description before ordering (composite board and laminate). I had expected this to be real wood, or at least something looking a little more like real Maple than a poor imitation of it which looks cheap, even though the product seems quite substantial. I still love the idea and creativity of the design and how it enables such a great amount of storage in such a small space in a corner, so I won't be returning it, but I probably will be painting it before I hang it up in my corner."
2,ugly greenish tint,"Didn't bother putting shelf together, so I can't comment on the stability or functionality. I won't be using it in my home because the color is unappealing and not what it looks like on the website. It has an artificial looking green tint to it. I have no problem with laminate furntiture. Own a lot from Ikea, but this is really low end laminate in my opinion. Maybe the dark brown would look better. Oh, you should also know that the company refused to accept a return of the item unless i paid shipping and restocking fee."
4,Buy with confidence,This seller did contact me regardng the return. The shelves were great just too large for the area I wanted to install them. Everything was resolved
1,Haven't received!,"I have been waiting over 6 weeks for this product and still haven't gotten it yet. The company claims it is backordered, but that was never mentioned when I purchased the product and they have cahrged me for it."
4,So Peaceful,"I accidentally discovered this album when listening t online radio and knew I had to have it. I am always searching for peaceful, soothing music and this definitely has it. My favorite tracks are Moon of First Snow, Hymn of Peace, and track #11 (the title escapes me) and IMO, the CD is worth having just for those tracks alone, though there are others that are great as well. This is some of the most peaceful, soothing music I have ever run across, and hopefully, not the last."
4,Nice way to re-enter the fandom,"I've not read X-men since I graduated high school in the mid-90's. I've enjoyed the various super-hero movies and picked up this based on a ""what to read if you liked Avengers and what more Whedon"". Very good book to ease back into the fandom."
2,For hard-core comics nerds only. Indulgent and irrelevent.,"While the artist tries hard for a spare, human-feeling look that is a logical extension of the X-Men movie world, I was really let down by this series because of the references to twenty year old X-men stories and almost nothing going on as far as new ideas. This is an X-men series that DOESN'T make you think (but a-bit-too-gladly pushes all the right buttons with 30-year-old fan boy types that are Joss Whedon's core audience). I'm twelve and I much preferred the edgy and very original stuff that Grant Morrison did with this series."
5,"This is What The ""X-Men"" Are All About","Cyclops, Beast, Emma Frost, Kitty Pryde, and Wolverine. these are the Astonishing X-Men, set out to protect the very people that hate them, and now someone has found a ""Cure"" for the mutation chromosome people are calling a ""disease"".This is one of the greatest X-men Franchises ever. Whedon's story-telling is amazing while Cassaday's art is some of the best I have seen. from what i hear, the rest of the series is equally amazing."
4,Joss Whedon and John Cassaday are a Dynamic Team,"Joss and John have combined to create a superhero-like force of comic book creation.Joss' writing style is great and his ability to weave a story keeps the reader turning pages even as they pore over John's beautiful artistry and storytelling.John draws beautifully and this volume is no exception, these large, full colored images jump off the page effortlessly and pull the reader into the story fully. John's storytelling with pictures combines beautifully with Joss' vision of the comic book. At one point there are two pages of pictures with no words at all, that in my opinion are the two most powerful pages in all the comic books I have read. This is just an amazing comic.After this one, the story continues for three more volumes that continue and complete this story.These volumes can be summed up in one word...Astonishing"
2,Teeny bopper X-MEN,"With all do respect to the artists and writers who I'm sure poured their hearts into this, I cannot agree with most of the readers here. This story arc is weak, boring and the art is sub par and cartoony at best, I mean c'mon it's X-MEN. We dont really need to be bombarded with wordy dramas, not to say that these stories should not be intelligent,(check out Brian Michael Bendis, Ed Brubaker and my personal favorite Grant Morrison's take on the X-MEN), It's just that the balance of sci fi action and geeks drama should be at balance, here it feels like they were catering to teenage girls, wich is fine for Buffy and Angel, but not our beloved X-Men."
5,This is why I love the X-Men.,"I recently started reading X-Men comics (and comics in general) after a several year hiatus. Whedon captures everything I love about these characters in these six issues and reminds me why I loved them in the first place. Beast (my favorite comic book character ever) is so well-written in this book and his journey is so touching, it's unbelievable. I never expected a writter to explore Beast the way Whedon does. I also enjoyed Kitty and Emma's little spats and the several nods to X-Men lore that only a true fan of the series like Whedon would have included. The story, while not the most creative, is very well written and has a great pace. The use of humor is a great welcome, as well, without getting in the way of the story. And Cassaday's art is just awe-inspiring. I highly recommend this to anyone, even if you've never read an X-Men comic before. It's something that anyone can pick up and understand."
5,x-men comics return to their very best,"Just want to reinforce how good this set of x-men comics really are. Awesome art, very witty story line and genuinely laugh out loud funny in parts. Never seen such a great combination of intelligent writing, comedy, art and action in a comic story before. It's also a great team of X-men, with Wolverine, Beast, Cyclops, Kitty and Emma (although not great fan of Emma), with a great long lost addition to the team towards the end of this graphic novel. Btw, it's better than vol.2 of astonishing x-men.Simply the best x-men since the great old days of Claremont and Byrne"
5,Great start to a great run,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a great introduction to a fantastic run by Joss Whedon and John Cassaday. Throughout the series, Whedon crafts an exciting story with many twists and turns. He makes a very complex and rich storyline that avoids being contrived or difficult to follow. Cassaday's art complements the style perfectly, and does a great deal to help with the story.I can't recommend this storyline enough. Whedon and Cassaday completed 24 total issues during their run with Astonishing X-Men, which are compiled in Astonishing X-Men volumes 1-4. Each book is very enjoyable and well worth the purchase."
3,Survives on chemistry of the leading men,"A pure formulaic film which employs the lost and found formula to lukewarm effect. This film belongs to the Deols, who are amazing and display chemistry to raise this film to bearable levels. They look happy and the audience joins them as well. This is a story about Sunny Deol who comes to India looking for his long lost brother, Bobby Deol and father Dharmendra. These family members are small time crooks in Varanasi and take him under their wings as their main muscle man. Meanwhile Bobby falls in love with a woman whose brothers do not take his love kindly, whisking the damsel to Punjab. Of course the family of Deols follow the girl to Punjab and fairly hilarious situations ensue until the film ends happily. The film belongs to Sunny, who at 55 is still amazing in the action scenes. A very colorful and lively film, could have benefited from some serious editing. Three stars."
2,Alterna-Punk Ahoy,"This is a collection of poppy (the really laid back mundane kind) punk songs. Saving points are songs by Swinging Utters, NOFX, and Screw 32. If you like bands that sound like a sped-up version of Savage Garden go ahead. Track Listing 1. Murphy's Law: How to Start a Fight 2. Red 5: Selfish Girl 3. Me First and the Gimme Gimmes: Mother and Child Reunion 4. Screw 32: Best Revenge 5. 22 Jacks: So Sorry 6. Dance Hall Crashers: We Owe 7. The Rudiments: Superhero Chicken S--- 8.

Hagfish: Red, White, and Blue 15. Odd Numbers: If I Knew 16. Blount: The Truth 17. Youth Brigade: Believe in Something 18. No Use For A Name: Fairytale of New York"
4,Very soothing to ears!,"Armik's music capitulates the listener into zealous atmosphere and beautiful scenery. Lost In Paradise songs unfolds in progressively arresting scenic beauty in a landscape characterised by several waterfalls, tranquil and dazzling rivers and love. Absolutely soothing to your ears!"
2,"Redundant melodies, but.....","I use to be a big fan of Armik, but, after the second C.d. all started sound the same. As I listened to his 3rd C.D. at the listening stations, I thought to myself, ""this song sounds exactly like a song on either his 1st or 2nd c.d. It's haunting. Don't get me wrong, Armik is a good guitarist, however, I would love to see him perform one day. When?!?!?!? I was at Tower records a few days ago and stopped at a listening station bby an artist Roger Espinoza. I was blown away by his guitar playing. Whew!!His songs are very melodic and he has a very organic feel to his music. Anyway, keep up the guitar playing Armik and maybe you'll do a show here in L.A. Melisssa"
3,Armik needs to read these reviews...,"I hope Armik reads the reviews that complain about his melodies being repeated in all of his CDs. It is true !! He is still a master guitarist and his melodies are beautiful, but repeated over and over ! I hope he realizes that it can and will affect the sales of his CDs !!"
3,not as new as expected,"I was somewhat disappoined--we did try to get this record as soon as possible from the States (it is still not availbale in Australia) and basically the CD is a kind of complilation, not exact but very resembling old great hits of the first few records"
2,"good guitar player, BUT?","Armik is a good guitar player, but the music he playes is more greek than it is Flamenco. his new cd has good sounds, but nothing new and different than the old cd's he has out there."
5,"Great, looks great in my bathroom",We had one like this that broke when a glass fell in it. We found this on Amazon and it fit just like the old one. However the mounting holes had to be repositioned.Looks great in the bathroom.
3,J.J. on trombone,"The print font is TOO small in this book for enjoyable reading, so far I am not to trilled with it."
2,Not worth it,"While the book is cute and contains nice textures, there is no real story. It is also very short. I've made up a new story to tell my toddler when we read it, but it is definitely not one of my favorite children's books."
2,Defective out of the box,"I was very excited to receive my Emglo M790-HC4V air compressor today. When ordering it, I really liked the size and layout of the controls and gauges. Unfortunatly, it arrived dead on arrival. After I installed the oil in the compresor crankcase and turned it on, the motor hummed loudly as though it had a shorted winding and refused to turn the compressor. I WAS NOT HAPPY. OK, now I have to return this thing... After close examination, I was surprised to see that the compressor / motor unit is mostly a white metal casting that is secured to the chassis with self tapping screws. This low cost ""cheap and dirty"" method of securing the unit to the frame makes me wonder abut the quality of the internal design....Thanks Emglo but no thanks."
3,"Surprisingly thoughtful, entertaining read","I actually found this book at the library on a free, discarded book table. It had my two favorite things, Hawaii and George Eliot. I was meant to find it! I finished reading it in a day and found it entertaining. Very entertaining. I never guessed who the killer was and found the plot zipped along nicely. Some of the earlier dialog was a little strange and I am still not sure if the fashion designer fell or jumped but it was a good read. The killer was a total surprise!!"
1,My Opinion of Ms. Skom,"I did not read this book, but I did take a class with the author, Edith Skom, at Northwestern University. She is an arrogant, snotty woman with little care for whether her students are learning. So in the name of all that is good and decent, do not read this book or try to purchase it-- if, that is, there are any copies of her retarded books still extant."
3,hammers go hi-tec,"Hammers are my thing, if there is an unusual hammer I buy it. This hammer wasn't shelved after the first job. I like the design, the weight and the nail puller on the side face.This hammer has become my main hammer at work."
4,Great game for the whole family!,This is a terrific video game! Shrek Superslam looks just like the Shrek movies. Very colorful! This is an arena-style game where you and up to 4 players can battle it out in fun arenas playing characters from the movies. There is a type of choose-your-own-battle area as well as a mega challenge map full of preset fights. This map allows you to win challenges that unlock new characters and areas. Some are very easy and several are quite hard! Each character has its own skill tree of unique moves and attacks. Each arena has weapons you can pick up and use against your opponent. Earn hilarious trophies and destroy the arena you're fighting in with your characters' slams. Great Christmas gift!
4,Kid love it,"I got this for the kids, and they love it. I find is a bit boring the the kids like and that what matter. They like playing king of the hill, where the charactors battle to take of the hill. There are other games but we haven;t gotten in to them yet."
2,Disapointed,I had much fun with Shrek 2 and I bought the Super Slam thinking it would be as fun as the other one. I got disapointed!
4,Bella's Lamp in New Moon or for Everyone else: A Nice little lamp,"Bella Swan uses this type of square lamp in New Moon. You can check out the LA Times blog ""On the Set"" to see photos. I ordered it when I was redoing my bedroom and took inspiration from the movie. The photo advertised shows a nice lamp but when you get it - you have to be careful that you don't rip or completely crumple the cloth shade. The instructions aren't very clear. It tells you to lay items on floor when starting but doesn't state what items there are so you're kinda of wondering if you have all the pieces. Uses 60 watt bulb (not included). Bottom of lamp is a sturdier silver colored base. It's a lamp with a minimalistic look, good for bedside reading. I ordered this from Amazon as my local Target was sold out but quick delivery was great."
5,A Real Treasure,"I heard about this book and bought it because I thought my middle schooler would like it. She loves it because it makes learning about history fun and interesting, and, as parents, we are really enjoying it. The book is extremely comprehensive and, at the same time, fun to read with the pictures of Anthony in each piece of history. The categorized list of movies, books and other references in the back is wonderful. I bought this book for my father who enjoys history. This book is a real treasure and keepsake."
5,Outstanding historical literature for children and all ages,"Michael S. Class has created an amazing piece of literature that touches on the importance of how history and the present weave together. As he explores particular historical events and how they have impacted the way society functions today, Michael has taken it a step further. His visual interpretation of Anthony is a creative masterpiece. The illustrations capture the imagination of both the young and the old while the text inspires people to think about their own past. Anthony and the Magic Picture Frame is a solid piece of literature and a wonderful piece of art. This book will introduce children to history in a new, lively and exciting manner. Michael is bringing back an education that creates children who are deep thinkers and life-long learners. Don't waste another second. This is a gift for all.Cherie McIntosh, Deena CookP & P Publishing LLC[...]"
5,Buy this album!,"I bought this cd the first day it came out and I'm totally hooked! all of the songs are great, the music and production is incredible and impressive for such a young new band. The Neil Young cover is amazing. In other words -- I love this cd."
4,This was an old nostalgic movie from the 1960's that made me reminense about my grandparents and a simplier time of life!,This was a good movie that reminded me of my grandparents in the 1960's where I watched the movie for the first time. It reminded me of a simplier and less stressful and hectic time of life!
5,The Deadline - A necessity.,"I can not thank you enough for writing this book. The content of the book was not only completetly relevant but so insightful into a topic (sw project management) that is grossly ignored by many people who are in charge of large projects and groups of developers. My experience (7 yrs as a developer) has been that experienced programmers end up ""managing"" projects. The problem is that they have spent their time developing software and do not seem to know anything about managing a project. The Deadline addressed the important issues of software project management head on by presenting problems to be solved and ways of solving them not just with ideas by specific methods. Not only did I appreciate the material but the format of the book may it enjoyable to read. For a software developer who is starting to realize how much more there is to software development than wich language you know this book is a necessity."
3,"A enjoyable read, but too ideal to actually help","I enjoyed reading this book, anyone who has been on a tight project will be able to relate to many of the events. In fact the ability to relate kind of spoils it, you can guess what is coming next. Also one or two of the events are far too idealised to really give the storyline any bite. It is a reasonable way of winding down after a hard day of trying to get the job done.For me personally I didn't actually learn anything, a book such as 'Death March' provides more real information."
4,A novel of IT project management per Goldratt's Goal,"This is perhaps the only management novel for IT. In the vein of ""the Goal"" by Goldratt, Tom DeMarco preaches the gospel of good project management. The ideas on staffing, conflict resolution and managing to deadlines are very helpful. The challenge is that the novel format could and should provide insight into the conflicts dealing with situations that are not ideal. In reality, we are left with great ideas, but a lost opportunity on the difficulties of implementing them."
4,"A fun read, with plenty to learn...","If you normally fall asleep while reading books about Project Management, give this one a try. Set in the form of a novel, the reader follows the experiences of a Project Manager charged with bringing home a series of project with typically impossible deadlines.This is not a text book. If you're new to Project Management, I recommend that you start elsewhere. However, if you've been involved in projects or find yourself in the lucky position of being a Project Manager, this book provides some valuable ideas about how to improve your project -- or at least cope with inevitabilities.If you enjoy this book, also look at ""The Goal"" by Eliyahu Goldratt and Jeff Cox, and also ""Zapp: The Lightning of Improvement"" by William Byham."
5,SW Project Mngmnt Myth Breaker which leaves you open-mouthed,"This fascinating book breaks a lot of myths, and more important, points out bad habits and beleifs the software managers had for decades (and still have). One can wonder if all the ways of doing things described in this book actually work in the real life. But think that the author (that has many years in this field) has collected the most important issues which affect the SW development process, as learned from painful experiences of thousands of developers in many years. If you are a SW manager and have a stubborn & old-fashioned boss, give him this book. No one likes to be Allair Belok."
4,Enjoyable presentation of software development principles,"This book is a lot more enjoyable than most software projects!Aimed mostly at developers of medium- to large-scale software projects, it's a fun read with a message. The principles are all summarized in the protagonist's ""Journal"", ensuring that you don't miss any of Demarco's points.Thought-provoking even if we don't agree with everything - and quite probably we should."
2,Not the author's best (includes spoilers),"While I greatly enjoyed DeMarco's non-fiction books ""Peopleware"" and ""Slack"", I felt this attempt at a novel was weak.*** spoiler warning ***Tompkins, the main character, has supposedly been chosen for his role in this novel because he is an gifted, experienced manager. Yet pretty much every chapter is a lesson he learns by screwing up. Perhaps I would have found it more palatable if the character was a newly-promoted manager, who knew he was ignorant.In the end, comes the revelation that, in spite of all the mistakes, he is an excellent manager because he *cares* about people. I don't see how this shows. Among the management problems he faces is reporting to a difficult supervisor up the chain, and the solution to this problem is essentially to have the man poisoned and sent to the hospital! Can you say cognitive dissonance?"
3,Some fun for the weekend,I have read the book in a glimpse. It is fun and full of insight.The only thing that I missed is a couple of references per chapter :)
3,Neither fowl nor fish,"The good: The book is an enjoyable read, it raised some interesting ideas, and it really motivated me to do ""what I know is right"" even when opposed by management or others in the organization.The bad: The book is both a novel and a project management text book - and as such it fails somewhat as either. As a novel the plot (especially the romantic plot) is too shallow and linear. As a project management text book it was difficult to know: Is this solution something DeMarco has researched and found useful, or is it merely speculation on his part? Since it is a novel, there's no way to tell - there are no references to real-world cases or research.Still - it WAS an enjoyable read, the main character was quite inspirational, some of the ideas quite fresh, and it was a welcome relief from heavier literature on the subject of project management."
2,"Hey, De Marco, Stick to non-fiction","The good: it has a few insights into software project management. Most are pretty trivial though.The bad: in terms of prose, the story and characters, it's simply horrible. Such lame and superficial literary devices.. e.g. at the very end the authors wants let us have closure, I guess, about the major characters. So he arranges for the protagonist to meet with a future-teller who then foretells him what each character ended up doing years after. Like some lame ass montage at the end of a horrible cheesy movie. The entire book is like this.I say if you're going to read something by the author, stick to the nonfiction, because you'll get more bang for the buck and you wouldn't have to endure what I just went through with this thing."
2,Boring -- feels like fiction and shouldn't be used as an educational tool,"It felt like a class assignment that someone published.""write a fictional story based on project management""The story line was contrived and just put into place because it had to be there to make a ""story"". (probably a better analogy is porn)"
3,"Good mgmt info, cussing, and personal opinions","If you want good management info, just read the summary statements at the end of each chapter. This is a project management book in which Mr. DeMarco takes the opportunity to throw in cussing and his own personal opinions on child-rearing and religion. So if you want to get his liberal opinions and read the other filth, go ahead and read the whole thing. I'm asking for my money back. Most of this is already in PeopleWare."
5,Should have read it years ago.,"If every boss, owner, manager, teacher, parent, partner, head of state, & clergy read this we might have a better world. It'a fun read."
1,Save Your Money,"The title of this book is very appealing, but it is simply not reliable history. How can a reader rely on any of it when, for example, it remarks on page 50 that Private Soldier Jonathan probably didn't smell too bad, because his diet was lean in the animal fats that cause body odor -- but then on page 51 we are told that ""what with all the lard issued,"" Jonathan's diet was 4,000 calories a day, and on page 73 that Jonathan ate beef several times a week, and on page 75 that one of his favorite rations was pemmican ""with its high fat content."" And many a school kid would know better than to assert, page 77, that the line in ""Yankee Doodle"" about macaroni refers to a new fad in noodles brought home from Italy. All of this is presented in a breezy fashion without a single note of sources where the reader could check the accuracy. Read this book with caution. Or better yet, don't read it at all."
5,Old Time Strings Meet Modern Bluegrass,"Byron Berline is by far one of the best fiddle players. Backed up by the Dillards on classic fiddle tunes, he has never sounded better -- just take a listen the Fischer's Hornpipe. The second half of the album shifts to the Dillards alone, with their unique take on Bluegrass, including many original tunes. Play the one CD and you have a double treat."
4,excerpts from Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly,"Here are some reviews of this very enjoyable book:excerpt from KIRKUS REVIEWS (June 15, 1995):An unobtrusive and extraordinarily controlled narrative voice . . . Spatz has no real surprises in store, but, instead, wisely concentrates on the niceties of description and characterization rather than plot. What we are left with finally is a marvelously quiet evocation (as opposed to narration) of a young man's awakening. Simple, precise, and rewarding work, nicely understated and free from contrivance.excerpt from PUBLISHERS WEEKLY (June 19, 1995):[Spatz's] story engages the reader with the compelling parallel voyages of self-discovery undertaken not just by the moody protagonist but also by Jolene, Angel and Mary, three fully drawn women on very different paths.excerpt from PLAYBOY (review written by Digby Diehl):A sharp, witty first novel about a boy with a troubled mother and his affair with her best friend.I recommend this book enthusiastically."
3,"Interesting, but too staged","Small and precise story in which the first half is devoted to a 16-year old boy having an affair with his mother's best friend, Jolene--who takes care of him while his mother is in the hospital recovering from a suicide attempt. This could all easily fall into the realm of prurient fantasy, but fortunately doesn't. There are the usual problems in which the thoughts and insights of a 16-year old are much more lucid and knowing than his age would dictate, but this is a typical failing of writers attempting this kind of book. The latter half of the book picks up events three years later, as the boy and his new girlfriend drive across country to find Jolene and see how she has turned out. In the end it's all kind of interesting, but too carefully painted and staged to feel real."
5,Start your medical billing research with this book!,"I wish I had known about this book before I began my research for my medical billing business. It covers all the important issues about starting your business including specific marketing ideas, samples of letters and forms, and what to expect from medical providers. The book is written with a sense of humor so it is fun reading as well. The best thing about this book is that it gave me focus. There is an incredible amount of information about this business from a variety of sources and this book sorts it all out. I recommend it to anyone who is serious about getting into the medical billing business."
3,Helpful...but,"The book was helpful; but if you really want guidance from Mr. Coslick or anyone in his organization, all I can say is GOOD LUCK."
5,Worth The Wait!,"Finally it's been re-released! I'd been looking for a copy of this video for the last 8 years or more. When I saw that it was scheduled for re-release I immediately signed up for an advance purchase so that whenever it came out I would get a copy. It captures the energy and excitement of a live Kinks performance as well as any film could. The music is great, as well as the stage presence of the band. I quickly sat down to watch it with my kids, since it is appropriate for all ages. Recorded in 1980, it's lacking the profanity and vulgarity that is so prevalent in music these days. My only complaint would be that it's not longer. 60 minutes leaves me wanting still more. Anyone who likes The Kinks even a little will love this video."
5,Must-have for British Invasion fans!,"I was not overwhelmed by the video quality but it was quite acceptable considering the age of the tape. The music itself more than makes up for any questionable video quality, as there is a great combination of old and new (for that time, around 1980, I think) songs that are just a glimpse of Ray Davies' genius. The entire band rocks, though, and even at his age Ray Davies is quite the showman! He puts Mick Jagger to shame! Ray jumps, runs, poses, hams it up, and in spurts acts plain crazy! Even if you are not that familiar with The Kinks you will enjoy the music on this DVD. Dave Davies does a running commentary and at times is pretty funny, especially when he makes fun of himself. Wish there could have been more extras, such as more songs, more archive footage, and perhaps some commentary by Ray or an interview of him. Minor complaints aside, this DVD is still worth having. Get it before it goes out of print!"
3,"One for the Road, OK, but could be better.","I am an old Kinks fan, and this DVD is fairly interesting. I believe the picture quality could be better, maybe if the film was remixed to higher quality (but not sure). Ray's stage presence is evident, and the band performs fairly well, although at times sounding somewhat raw or ""garage bandish."" The sound quality is ""ok"" but could have been remixed digitally a little bit better. Overall, if you are a Kink's fan, you should like the DVD, but just be prepared for a film that is not quite up to current DVD quality compared to modern standards."
5,The very best of the very best Jazz from the very best era !,"Joel Dorn has once again given us a thrill to the ears and soul ! I thought I would never again hear songs such as Autin Cromer's ""Over The Rainbow"". I first had the pleasure of meeting Joel back in the mid- 1960's when he was a DJ on W-H-A-T-FM in Phila. He brought us the greatest Jazz then and he is still bringing it to us. This CD is one of my favorites and a must for all Jazz fans. Thanks again Joel....keep up the great work........Judi Rivell/Jaume Rivell-Hufnell, Bucks County Pa."
4,"Good product, cheaper than most","These are good gauges at a reasonable price. I use them in a high humidity enclosure and sometimes condensation will collect on the plastic in the front, making it harder to read the numbers. However this is not a big problem. I would still recommend."
1,Almost a excellent product!,"I got the rule and was dissapointed, it would be the best rule on the planet BUT it is too flimsey, a stiffer thicker metal would fix the problem.When you put the edge guide against the edge of a piece of wood the rule flexes and pulls the edge guide up and you get 1/16"" play, if you place a long piece of flat stock on the rule it will stay flat. PAIN IN THE [...]!! especially when you try to slide and mark a line.Oh well live and learn."
2,Not the best phone...get what you pay for,"The answering machine recorder is really poor quality. You sound like you are in a barrel with static and your voice is not clear. You sound far, far away. Not so professional for a business answering machine. Features it doesn't have that I wish it had is a speaker option and a ""do not disturb"" button. Really loud ring, not sure if you can adjust that."
3,Not Bad...Just Don't Go Far.,"I live in a very small apartment and I can walk from one side to the other, but I I walk out the door, the signal gets crackly and then gone!The phone other wise is good, just a little harder to program than most.Oh, and the battery cover keeps popping off. Annoying.But otherwise a good phone."
4,a fun introduction,I am thinking about adding a world mythology flair to our family reading. It's hard to read this book as a straight story -- it is fairly cartoonish -- but it is great for introducing the characters and stories to children. Marcia Williams simplifies and clarifies the stories -- and all her characters are funny.
1,Insults the intelligence of Parents and Children,"Never has a book so insulted my intelligence more than this one, REALLY! Does the author actually expect me to believe that this will be entertaining to my children. This book only demonstrates how far the modern age has stooped in the dumbing-down of our children. A good introduction for children is ""The Iliad of Homer (Oxford Myths and Legends)"" by Barbara Leonie Picard and Joan Kiddell-Monroe (Illustrator), but stay away from this one for sure!"
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"As a MOTHER, I found this book to be appalling. It's not funny or cute. My mother-in-law received this book at my baby shower for my first baby and has taken it seriously and as a MOTHER of MY CHILD, I'm here to tell you, after I read through the book and after hearing her comments about it, she doesn't keep the baby anymore. Grandparents are not parents. They had their chance, and this ignorant book condones grandmothers sticking their nose where it doesn't belong. Any grandmother that follows the ""rules"" in this book is asking never to see their grandchild again!!!!"
1,Seriously?,"This book should be called ""How to Make Sure You Never See Your Grandkids Again."" What kind of idiot thinks that it is okay to disregard the wishes of the PARENTS and lie to them about their child. Anyone who takes the advice of this book seriously deserves it when their children cut them off from ever seeing the grandkids again. I only gave this book 1 star because there was no option for no stars."
4,full of humor,this book brings smiles and sometimes belly laughs as one navigates the trials of grandmotherhood. it makes a terrific gift for any age grandmother.
1,"""How to Be Alienate Your Children and Spoil Your Grandkids""","I was hoping that this book would have a humorous, yet practical, view of grandparenting. Unfortunately there is no tongue-in-cheek here. The author admitted that she is not the least bit interested in her kids....or what they have to say about parenting...only cares about her grandkids. In one passage she actually stated that she wanted to kill a cat. Also, the only rule that she has in her home is ""No Whining,"" one that can only benefit her, how about no fighting, etc. I was very troubled by her suggestion of having children lie to their parents. I also found it interesting that most of the 5 star reviews were posted within days of each other, shortly after the book was published, by authors with similar (bad) writing styles. Save your money."
1,How not to be a grandparent,"This is simply garbage. Encouraging kids to lie to their parents sets them up to be abused by cruel people. It is not appropriate for grandmas not to follow parents instruction. This book isn't about the grandma who buys a toy at the grocery store or gives dessert before dinner. It's about being ""the most relevant person in that child's life"" sorry. Grandmas are important if they are good people not boundary stomping jerks like this book encourages."
2,Not the best French movie I've ever seen,"Well, I've seen it. And now I won't have to see it again. It's a rare window into life in France during the restoration of the Bourbons who neither learned anything from the French Revolution nor forgot anything about their bad government before the deluge. I wasn't Stendhal's greatest work either; that was The Charterhouse of Parma. But it's a good cinematization of the novel though the product is not soul-stirring."
4,A very enjoyable read for all MD-11 afficianados,"The MD-11 - a sadly maligned beast of the airways. With it's well publised problems upon entry to service and being a victim of bad timing, the MD-11 has always been a little ignored when compared to it's Airbus and Boeing rivals. This book is probably the best read about the MD-11, covering it's development, the PIP program and it's service with airlines around the world. An added bonus is the coverage of the MD-10 program for FEDEX. Overall an informative read with plenty of excellent illustrations and photos."
5,Beautiful.....yes it certainly is,"I had never heard of this band apart from a crazy friend who loved their early stuff. The latest offering from Eskimo Joe - ""A Song is a City"" is a fantastic album. The songs all contain soft melodic tunes, as well the necessary guitar riffs to make it easy on the ears. They sound similar to Matchbox 20, but with a bit of Radiohead attached.The best songs on the album are: From the City, Older Than You, Car Crash, Smoke and the ultimate awesome song...Wake Up.Eskimo Joe is an emerging alternative band, and I strongly urge you to jump onboard. Big things are ahead..."
3,Meh...,"A couple of good tunes, but mostly forgettable. You'd have no idea this was the same band that made Black Fingernails."
4,Fire and Brimstone Punk novel,"Joe Martin was a mid-teen punk in 1977, valuing the music and not the fashion unless it was a punkette in fishnets! We follow Joe and his friends through their growing pains and escapades, suffering and laughing with them as they struggle to make sense of the adult world.Joe and his best friend, Smiles, are involved in a pivotal incident during the Queen's Jubilee year which colours the middle third of the book (set in 1988) and the final third (2000).John King gets under the skin of his characters, making them believable. There is terrifying violence and the softest of love within these pages and the conflicting emotions are portrayed with pragmatism.It's a book especially compelling for someone who grew up in the same era as Joe Martin. King hits so many nails on the head it's like reading your own life story."
2,Vermont Wedding Advertising Guide,"Being a Vermonter who is about to get married I was hoping to get a comprehensive listing of potential sites for receptions. Given the many wonderful locations available in our beautiful state, I was quite surprized to see that most were missing, and the ones listed were done based upon a paid listing. Consequently, if a potential location, no matter how special, did not pay the author, they were not listed. To my mind a resource guide is just that, a listing(and review) of every potential site in the state."
3,An enlightening look at life in 14th century Norway...,"Though the political details and language slowed me down at times, I found it fascinating to learn what life was like for a woman in Norway in the 1300's. The social, economic, and political aspects of the time are interestingly and thoroughly presented. I would suggest that not too many years go by between reading the books in the trilogy because you will have a greater appreciation for what is going on if you remember details from the previous books."
5,Fantastic! A must-have! Real life situations and solutions!,"Since reading this book, I have purchased every copy I couldget my hands on to give away to those who are suffering orneed help. Biebel puts God right by your side.Numerous real life examples allow almost anyone to relate tothe pain and emotions so many now deny themselves access to.Immediately, Biebel shelves the ""advice"", ""one-liners"",""religious answers"" and goes for the guts.Has given many silently suffering wanderers the map andcompass to find their way through life'spain. Turns pain into meaningful journey and stepping stoneto healthy relationships with God and others."
2,You get what you pay for. ! ! ! !,"Poor quality fittings, sloppy peg holes and super cheap Chinese wire (aka strings) make these Chinese made units frustrating to anyone especially students. They're next to impossible to tune and keep in tune. The basic violin body is acceptable but you'd have to refit it and string it with decent strings and possibly then you'd have a passable beginners unit. There are tons of these cheap Chinese units here on Amazon and Ebay. There's no way of getting around it, if you are serious about learning the violin, you are going to have to spend $300. or more for a decent Euro or US made unit. I wonder how many Chinese people named Doreli there are among the billions of Chinese! I think Amazon should make it mandatory all sellers list the country of manufacture on all products sold new."
5,The golden album of Pierre Fournier!,"I had the privilege to watch Pierre Fournier in Caracas (at the late seventies) playing the Lalo's cello Concerto. Needless to say this was the most effervescent, exciting and vibrant livig performance I have ever heard until these days.I must add this concerto is not among my favorite ones, but Fournier is the only cellist who motivates me to listen it. That's why I recommend you. Because somehow, this Op. seems to have been composed for this memorable artist.Adittionally, the Saint Saens and the Schelomo are extremely rewarding too. If I had to make my bag to a desert island, this would be my choice for Fournier.Don't miss it."
2,Absolutely ghastly!,"Mr. Fournier's version of Lalo and Saint Saens concertos have to be the most HEDIOUS things to ever come out on the cello. He plays almost everything on this album with such noble technicality-- little or no variation of the tempo or dynamics. He plays the Lalo as if it were a Dvorak concerto. The Saint Saens cadenzas are almost rhythmic with little or no tempo alterations, and here again on a more romantic approach. I've heard much better cellists play Saint Saens. Leave this album alone!"
5,great!,I bought this to put on an Epiphone SG with a bad volume pot. I had to drill out the hole because it was slightly fatter than the old Epiphone pot. Also it sticks up a little higher. It feels smooth though. In retrospect I'd probably replaced both volumes and both tone pots next time so they all match.
4,Very Cute! but small,"I was not expecting this to be as small as it is when it arrived. It is extremely cute, and will fit in my ""gadget"" drawer well. When I showed it to my husband he said it looked like it was for kids, I agreed. I have not used it yet, but am thinking the reviewer who said it got into the nooks and crannies well is probably right, it should do a good job at that, so I will see if I like it for overall potato scrubbing as well or if I will want two brushes."
5,So cute and Awesome,This is such an awesome scrub brush. Also it so cute seeing a potatoe scrub one another lol. This is very durable and it shipped quickly as well
4,nice little knife,"It's a nice knife. A little bit smaller then I had expected which makes it kind of difficult to open with one hand(can be swung open.) The handle taps likes plastic, but feels like rubber. The blade isn't the sharpest but it is not dull either. It is unnoticeably light to carry, a butter knife is heavier. Decent small everyday knife you won't mind cutting fruit with, or dulling the blade."
5,"Small, but useful.","The knife is very light, easily fits in just about any pocket, is sharp, and is very useful for when you're out in the wilderness and maybe need it for cutting small vines, etc."
1,dangerous for user,"I thought that it would be a good little knife just to have for work/opening the occasional box, but one came to me broken. They're sharp that's for sure, but the knife, out of the box, was broken at the hinge. I'm not about to use a knife that breaks right at the place where you need reliability. It was $1, but don't waste even that, it's less dangerous not having. Plus it was too small for self defense if one wanted it for that.I'd rather give it 0 stars."
3,Not as good as I thought,"I have been wanting a Maclaren Triumph for a while and was excited when the box finally arrived. It is light-weight as promised and easily maneouverable. But the wheels are small with no treads and it smells very strongly of chemicals used in production. However, my biggest disappointment was with the recline. Maclaren promises multiple reclining positions. Sure, multiple reclining positions between 1 and 4 inches--a very slight recline in my opinion. No baby is going to ever be comfortable sleeping in this seat."
4,A Glimpse Into the Future Church,The author takes us down a journey of his own experience of pastoring a church of many nations. He uses scripture as a foundation of his ministry and shows how different verses of the bible show how God's heart is for every nation. A must read for all in the full time ministry!
4,Very nice faucet,"I purchased 2 of these for the master bath. They are well made and sturdy and look very nice on our new vanity. I give the product 4 stars because we were unable to make the stoppers fit snugly to hold water in the sink. They slowly drain water, but since we rarely need to stop up the sink, it's not really a problem. I also purchased the shower faucet and the roman tub faucet with sprayer. I recommend them as well."
4,A Space in Time,"Nicolae Margineanu does a very good job at weaving kings, genuine and faux architects, dictators and the working poor, into a moving picture."
2,"Fun Read, but seems stuck in the 60s","Strange Valley was a fun read, and it goes fast, which is probably a good thing, because I'd hate to think I spent too much time on this one. It's got an interesting premise, but it fails to expand much beyond the premise. Character motivations are paper-thin and seem too often to just be a thinly disguised extension of the author's feelings with no logical grounding in the plot. And sure, it's fun to see someone taking a few pot shots at neo-conservative Christian mentalities, but hey, it doesn't always drive the book forward. And the sexual liberalism scenes, particularly the final one where the main characters are celebrating their success, come off as just some ridiculous throw-back to the 60s. Like something out of an Austin Powers spoof. Can you say campy?"
3,Maybe I did something wrong?,"I thought this was the cutest idea ever!But when i tried it on my one year old, it just didn't work out so great.She pushed her hand in it but the impression wasn't as deep as I thought it would be.I probably didn't mix it well or something? Cute idea though."
1,Never worked!,I bought two of these for my little girls as christmas presents last year. We opened christmas morning only to find they didnt work at all. We changed the batteries a few times hoping maybe it was just that but nothing. We were totally shocked and very unhappy!
2,Cute but not sturdy,"I purchased this walkman for my Goddaugher who is 4 years old. She enjoys listening to music especially her children CD's. She has a stationary radio in her room but often likes to walk around while listening to her music, ""like her older brothers and sisters"". The radio is very attractive but it skips continuously. It defeats the purpose of being a walkman since you can not walk if you want to enjoy your music"
1,Product Didnt Work!,"The day that i got this in the mail, my daughter and i pulled it out so that she could start using it. While the buttons and the process of listening to the CD's was easy, the player did nothing but skip and skip and scratched up her CD. I was so mad that i went online to find out how to return it... (company review wasnt great)"
1,Barbie CD Player,"What a hunk of junk! When opened on Xmas discovered the batteries dead, instructions were for a radio and not a cd player, missing the plug! Needless to say my niece was disappointed. Now I am struggling to figure out how to find how to send back this worthless piece of junk. I should have bought it from Toys R Us. Very disappointed and it looks like I will be stuck for this crappy thing."
2,sorry but it didn;t work,"We were very disappointed, this was a gift and it was substandard. I wish I had returned it My greandaughter was disappointed"
4,Barbie Tune Blossom,"My daughter loves this. She can listen to what she wants and her brother can listen on the other CD player. The ear phones are a little big for her 6 year old ears, so she doesn't use the ear buds, but uses other ear phones instead."
4,Growing Older &Wiser,"Very easy to use format for individual or small group Bible study and life application. At the back of the book, each chapter is given additional information to consider. Have been enjoying this engaging study in a women's small group."
2,Lacking for the serious leatherworker,"I'm disappointed in this book. The patterns supplied are much smaller than you would expect, making their appeal limited. Only half of the projects are actual handbags. All the projects use very lightweight garment leathers, which lack the structure a good bag needs. The instructions are okay, and the illustrations are generally helpful. The gallery section is just terrible; the examples shown are reminiscent of summer camp or slumber party projects in my opinion. It seems to be intended for cloth sewing hobbyists looking to make something simple in leather. Not for the serious leatherworkers. In all, I do not recommend this book, and would have returned it if the combined shipping costs would not have cost more than the book itself."
3,Purse maker,Loved this book. It explained things so clearly and the pictures are very helpful. The patterns included were also helpful as well. I would recommend this book to anyone serious about purse making.
4,"Not the best Sherman, but VERY good","There are indeed some wonderful songs here, and I guess FORTUOSITY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT, BYE-YUM PUM PUM and the single version of IT WON'T BE LONG 'TIL CHRISTMAS are really the best. But there is NO BOOKLET again, just like in BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS, and there is no instrumental score. I really think Disney should give this soundtracks the same treatment it gave to the ""bigger"" ones, like MARY POPPINS or ALICE IN WONDERLAND."
5,Eccentrically Charming,"As a child, The Happiest Millionaire was one of the first musicals I had the pleasure of seeing. Now, many years later, it continues to hold a very special place in my heart. I love both the movie and the soundtrack. I love the storyline, and the quirky characters, and the music.The songs are incredibly creative and so much fun. ""Watch Your Footwork,"" ""Bye Yum Pum Pum,"" and ""Let's Have a Drink On It Now"" make me want to dance around every time I play them in my car. However, I also love the slower, more sentimental tunes such as ""When a Man has a Daughter"" and ""It Won't Be Long 'Til Christmas."" And Tommy Steele singing ""I'll Always Be Irish"" is sure to make you swoon.Overall, The Happiest Millionaire is a story of family, love, embracing change as it comes, and taking nothing at face value. The soundtrack captures all of those things beautifully and it definitely showcases the charm and warmth of the movie."
4,Good basic coverage of Derrida,"I purchased this book because of the typical high quality of Routledge publications as well as the title which implied the possibility of understanding better the concept of Deconstruction.Barry Stocker takes us on a very competent overview of Derrida through the themes of Metaphysics, Language, Consciousness, Knowldege, Values, Metaphors and finally Deconstruction.However, since Deconstruction is not merely a concept or literary method, but a philosophy in itself, I find that I only approach understanding its meaning as I read more and more of Derrida.Stocker helps us get oriented to Derrida in a fairly ""close to the text"" approach, rather than the more interpretive approach of Penelope Deutscher's,How to Read Derrida, which I would start with first."
5,"With gorgeous, full-color traditional Huichol yarn drawings","The Journey Of Tunuri And The Blue Deer: A Huichol Indian Story by James Endredy is a captivating picture book rendition of a tale from the beliefs of the Huichol Indians of mountainous western Mexico. Gorgeous, full-color traditional Huichol yarn drawings created especially for The Journey Of Tunuri And The Blue Deer is enhanced with Maria Hernandez de la Cruz and Casimiro de la Cruz Lopez wonderful illustrations in this outstanding Native American folk tale of children who meet their family in nature (Grandfather Fire, Father Sun, Mother Earth, and Brother Wind) and learn to share the wonders of the planet in harmony. The Journey Of Tunuri And The Blue Deer is a highly recommended addition to school and community library Native American collections for young readers."
2,"Nothing new, too general","Having read nearly everything in this genre, I found this book discardable. It pales in comparison to, among others, ""The Bipolar Child"" by Demitri and Janice Papolos, ""A Sourcebook for Families Coping With Mental Illness"" by M.R. Berren, and the work of Kay Redfield Jamison."
4,Walls of Air,The book arrived in a timely manner. It was also in good shape as well as a good read.Thank you.
3,"A good series, but not the best book in it","""The Walls of Air"" is the sequel to Hambly's ""The Time of the Dark"". Although the characters are just as interesting to watch as in the previous book, the events move along much more slowly. I'd say that this book suffers from middle-book-itis, as it mostly spends time setting things up for the third book, ""The Armies of Daylight"".I think that the SF Book Club published this trilogy in one volume many years ago; if you are new to the Darwath books, try getting that one volume instead of buying this reprint edition.This is one of my favorite series by one of my favorite authors. If you have a low tolerence for journeys mental and spiritual, you'll find this book pretty sleep-inducing.I actually liked it, but I like to watch Ingold work, and I find Gil's learning process and scholarly work facinating. There's lots of both in this book, unlike the more exciting first and last books."
4,science fiction,this is one of a series that i read and it was good.. I liked the first one the best...I wish that more of the mysteries were resolved byt the third book but it was good anyway..
3,Neutral,"A little bit out of date and I don' have fourteen more words to write at this particular time, sorry."
4,Excellent Bibliography,"If you're looking for an excellent and exhaustive bibliography of 20th century American printmakers this is it! EVERY printed source (long alphabetized lists of exhibition brochures, raisonnes, magazine and newspaper articles, obits, etc.) on ALL known 20th century American printmakers, famous and obscure, are listed. Unfortunately, ONLY the cover is illustrated. Seriously, NO REPRODUCTIONS! This is not an art coffee table book but rather a reference source for 20th century American art history scholars and American print collectors. Hence, four stars instead of five."
2,Purchased in error,I was looking for a CD disc that could handle a large amount of data. They don't seem to be available. I bought this one in error; it fits a different kind of player. I can't use it.
2,Bought the wrong product,Product was not exactly what I thought it would be. I thought it would be a dual layer DVD. Maybe the description should be more especific.
2,The Fat Smash Diet,"No new information here. It is what is in all diet books. I read this book in one sitting, was not impressed."
1,Unsuccessful,"The book is pretty basic... eat right and exercise. However I find it hard to believe that you can ""trick"" your body into not craving carbs; it's really called self-control. I tried the diet and was unsuccessful, even after the 9 days of veggies and fruits only (with half hour exercise, sometimes more, I lost 0 lbs). I found it incredibly difficult to eat ONLY fruits and veggies for 9 days; after three days I couldn't stand the same fruits and veggies and it was difficult to be creative with limited food choices. I probably starved myself during those 9 days more than anything. I stopped the diet after a month and immediately added complex carbs back into my diet (whole grain bread, pasta) and that is when I began to lose weight. Just like all diet and exercise programs, it doesn't work for everybody. Avoid the hefty shipping charge and buy the book from a local bookstore if you really want to try it."
1,More FLASH than SMASH,"First, I have never written a review before, never felt it was worth my time, but this time is different. This guy is great at marketing but he is no expert on dieting or writing. This book is a total rip off. There are a handful or recipes. Nothing in this book is organized. There are calorie burning lists that were probably pulled off the internet somewhere. Just a total disaster. Save your money."
2,Disappointing Book,"I am at a plateau with my weight loss. As a matter of fact, I think I have gained weight. I have always enjoyed Dr. Ian's logic and words of wisdom, so I thought this book would help me reach my goal. But not so much.. The book has an introduction and a list of foods to eat and or not eat, but it does not give how much or how to use the detox list. It just list the items. I'm not sure if it will help me or not. I would give this book a thumbs down."
3,all of these books appear the same,"I guess it works for some and not for others. I purchased several of Ian Smith's books and they all read the same. I like the concept, but the menus are not that easy to duplicate if you have a low budget."
2,Smash Diet,"A little disappointed, re; the content somewhat vague. If you did not review content closely, one would have walk away with conflicting information re; the smash diet."
4,Healthier me,I highly approve this book. It was great for detoxing the body and assisting me in getting back on track.
4,If you can stick to it you will lose...,"I have had this book for nearly two years, and have bought it twice since i lost my original copy. The first time I did FAT SMASH, I lost 10lbs in 10 days during the detox phase. I was then told by my mother that i was getting to skinny and needed to stop losing weight, which sent my mind in a tailspin and I didn't knw what to do and ended up gaining it back. I have done Fat Smash over and over again in the past few years, doing the ridiculous yo-yo dieting and only passing the detox phase perhaps once, and I have to say you need to have STRONG willpower and ignore the nay sayers. It also is kinda hard to stick to because of the very limiting choices in the detox phase which last 9 full days. But I haven't done anything that made me lose that much weight that quickly. I am an all or nothing dieter so my biggest issue is that as soon as I have one bad meal I throw in the towel, but I think the principles he teaches will work, you just have to stick to it."
3,Great book but the plan is hard to stick to,The book has great info and advice but as an actual plan it kind of falls short unless you are already a very disciplined person... and let's face it... if you were... you wouldn't need the book. It's hard to stick to and you'll find yourself craving more junk food than you ever have before. But I believe that if you are determined enough you can be successful long term. Other wise it will be like any other plan.. you stick to it for a month or more but after a while you would have forgotten where you even put the damn book.
4,A good way to start your weight loss!,"I lost over 6 pounds during Phase I of this plan. The first couple of days with no meat were a little rough, but after a while you get used to it. I took advantage of eating Tofu."
5,easiest diet to follow,"book was easy to read, with clear instructions. No fluff, just gets right to the diet and how to stay on it. I also lost 10 pounds."
2,This diet is too strict for the average dieter.,"You gotta love Dr. Ian and overall this book is very well written. But the problem is the diet is very, very, VERY strict and harsh. Against my better judgement, I purchased this book as a Christmas present for my 19-year old daughter who wouldn't stop asking for it. She is an athlete and a college honors student, and only wants to lose 20 lbs. But I truly see no way that she would be able to ever stick to the strict letter of this diet. So I feel like I am setting her up to fail and the very first diet experience of her life will be failure. Not a good thing. I do not recommend this book for a first-time dieter, but I'm sure it would be fine for the more serious dieter. You REALLY need to be a strict dieter who can live on total fruits and veggies for 9 days if you want to use this book. Good luck."
4,Healthy Weightloss,"I did the DETOX portion of this ""diet"". I have had issues with eating plans that require you to eat only certain items because it restricts the normal eating behaviors. This however made complete sense. Fruits and vegatables are what we should be eating and you can eat as much of those as you wish. I lost 5 1/2 pounds in the 9 days and felt great. I am continuing to follow the guidelines set in the book and feel much better than I had previously."
1,Horrible!,I was very excited about this book and even paid extra to have it shipped overnight. There is little information other than to eat only fruits and vegetables. My gastric system rebelled violently and I was hungry constantly. Yes you could lose weight but you could do the same following any crash diet.
1,Nothing out of the ordinary....,"At the end of the day, losing weight means eating right and exercising. This book is short on substance and in a few short chapters, says you should eat right and exercise regularly. For those who don't know how to do either, this isn't a book that teaches you how."
2,smash diet,nothing new eat less and better foods and become more active you will lose weight.i think we already new this.
1,Unrealistic and idealistic diet,"I guess anyone who says they have the inside scoop about weight loss and writes a book will make money. After skimming through the restrictions, I put the book down and will not open it again. Oh well."
1,"For real results, join Weight Watchers!","Everyone is looking for a quick fix and this is NOT IT!! Being a fan of Celebrity Fit Club, I was looking forward to Dr. Ian's advice (even though he is a vegetarian and I am not). I have been a trainer for 10 years and this is the worst advice ever. If you really want to lose weight sensibly, join Weight Watchers or hire a Registered Dietician. One thing I have learned over the years, doctors are NOT dieticians NOR are they fitness trainers. Never eat less than 1200 calories per day and do not DEPRIVE yourself of foods you love. Simply eat them in moderation...i.e., eat one cookie instead of 10. Weight Watchers teaches you to eat sensibly with proper portion control and you have to weigh in each week which makes you accountable for your eating. Keep a food journal, walk 30 minutes a day and keep your portion sizes reasonable and you will be healthy."
4,Phase I,"I just got my book, it seems very easy to follow except the fact that there aren't any good examples of simple and quick to prepare meals for Phase I. I could really use some good ideas for QUICK meals that I can prepare for PHASE I. FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME tadarsha318@yahoo.com"
3,It works,"I pre-ordered my book from Dr. Ian's website and it shipped as promised..I have completed phase 1 and was very pleased with the 9-day results. 5 lbs. I can see and feel the difference. I am just starting phase II and realize that the old habits are being smashed. i thought i would be in a hurry to add some of the other foods back into my diet, but I was not, it really tested my creativity with vegetables. It would be nice to have some type of support group to go through these phases with. If anyone is interested, we can maybe get it started. I'll keep reading reviews to see if anyone wants to do this together."
4,The Fat Smash Diet: The Last Diet You'll Ever Need,When I first purchased the book I thought it was going to be another one of those diet books that said a lot of nothing. But I was pleasantly surpised. The book is easy to read and the recipes are very tasty. I have lost a total of 10 lbs so far. I recommend this book to anyone that has tried all the other diets out there and fail. If you follow Dr. Ian Smith's advice I promise you won't be disappoint.
3,Fat Smash Review,"Good Book, Anyone Intrested in this diet should definetly read the book before starting the diet, the phase 1 is nothing to play with, I would sug trying some of the ideas that Dr. Ian gives as meal options before going into full smash. Overall I'm still on the diet and its working very well. Be prepared this book the phases require will power and support. All veggies really smash the fat!(no meat bread ect all cut out) requires new way of cooking and eating.), but if thats not something that you can concieve leave it alone and try something else this diet is not for you. Overall its a good book and teaches you lessons on how to eat better throught the different phases.amack"
4,good so far,"I don't know what Starvin' Marvin's review is refering to, I havnen't been hungry all day...make sure you are eating frequently enough!Full Disclosure: I'm on my first day but have been pleasantly surprised in feeling sated...Ill be heading into my run tonight (i know, should have done it this morning) with plenty of energy. The recipes for detox in the book are few but hey it is detox and it's only 9 days and gives you something to look forward to in the next pahse, besides, there's always the internet for finding more recipes that work."
5,A Lifestyle Overhaul,This easy-to-follow plan is more than just a diet. There are also great healthy recipes for you to try.
2,Not as great as the hype,"This is not the diet for you unless you really enjoy eating healthy foods. It's not hard to follow really, but if you're not a big fan of eating healthy fruits and vegetables, you'll struggle with this diet unlike some other diet plans that let you eat lasagna or pizza, just a healthier version of them. I only lost 3 pounds in the first phase while others have supposedly lost much more. I quit after Phase III because I didn't lose much and yes, I did follow the diet and I did exercise."
2,yet another diet,"Dr Smith's Diet book seems to be a recipe for yet another crash/detox diet. I tried living on fruits and veggies for three days instead of the suggested 9. If I had been locked away from all TV commercials, co-workers eating hamburgers and french fries, children slurping and licking ice cream cones to cool down from 90+ degree temperatures, I might have lasted for 2 days. This diet is not for the faint of heart, the summer months,nor people who enjoy meat. A better stance would be to cut down on your portions as well as staying away from fats.Sorry Doc, but I did try."
2,Has NO ONE finished this program?,"Hmmm, 90% of reviewers are in or finishing Phase I...and the rest are in Phase II...Where are the people who have been on this beyond Phase III? I'm VERY suspect of a diet that shows only initial success...I can show you a multitude of diets that will make pounds 'melt' off in the first 2 weeks...but it's the LONG term that's important!A program like Body for Life is great this way!I'll wait for 4+ month advocates before I recommend this book!"
2,Great Book in gross condition!,"I enjoyed the book, after I cleaned it and aired it out. But the book looked as if the sender ate on top of the book. It was really gross and could have been cleaned up a bit before shipping (especially since it was advertised as excellent condition),and it reeked of cigarette smoke."
3,Diets are Different for Everyone,"Not a bad try by Mr. Smith, but as a nation we need to understand our bodies and incorporate mind and spirit. Capitalizing on everyone's fear of ""being fat,"" makes good money, but doesn't help those who truly want to be slim and healthy. Incorporating a more holistic approach, as in ""Forget The Cures, Find The Cause,"" by Gangi would help dieters reach more optimal health and balance."
3,Miss Unsure,I was kindof hyped up about buying this book but now i'm teetering on the fence. I'm not big on diets but i believe strongly in eating what you want with discipline. Based on most of your reviews it seems like a crash course diet. I'm a foodie & from what most reviews said phase I is the hardest I just don't think i'll make it to day two of phase I lol. I may still pick up the book anyway just to see what all the hoopla is about. Besides i like Dr. Ian i'll support.
1,Fat Smash Buster,"Something seems amiss in some of these reviews..like to hype the book and it appears they are not written by an actual dieter. Like by someone or somebodies to promote the book.All positive reviews are repeated twice. Positive reviews have the same style of writing like an infomercial. And notice the majority of the positive reviewers only reviewed this book.I was planning to buy the book, but based on my feelings of these reviews I pass.Isn't that the point of reading reviews to base an opinion on the book prior to reading it and not just reading it?"
2,This is a book? It seems more like a pamphlet,"I really wanted more substance in this book. Short little chapters, very little detail about diets, about the body, about why this diet is better or as good as other diets out there.Basically you get a few pages welcoming you to the diet and then a list of foods to include and not include. That's not a book. That's a grocery list. I like the doctor a lot on the TV show but I hate to say the ""book"" is a little light weight."
4,Finally...the help I needed!!!,"This book has really been a great asset to my goal of wieght loss. It has helped me tremendously. I am learning a new healthy way of eating. Its not just a ""diet"", its a life change. You have to be willing to make that change for this ""diet"" to work for you. Give it a shot. I have lost 10 lbs and I just started Phase II."
2,Very Weak Diet Book,"This book resembles more of a readers digest article than a book. It is only 56 pages of diet information combined with plenty of boxes of what you can eat, and the remainder of the book is recipes. The diet is very strict and on it you end up exercising 1 hour a day five days a week in the final phase.There is no explanation of why to follow the guidelines presented and very little dialogue from the author. Skip this book and pick up the Sonoma Diet or Ultrametabolism for a diet you can live with and to get your moneys worth.There is nothing new here, there is very little book."
1,Poorly Written,"This was poorly written. I emailed the author with discrepancies (like a recipe in the back for phase 1 that had things you are not allowed to eat in phase 1) and the author responded that was not his problem and was the problem with the editor. No apologies, but seriously, didn't HE write it? I was very disappointed. At that point I decided that was not the diet for me, because he didn't seem very with it."
3,I HOPE ITS WORTH IT,I GOT MY BOOK JUST THE OTHER DAY AND STARTED PHASE 1 RIGHT AWAY. AFTER ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST DAY I STARTED FEELING VERY TIRED AND GOT A HEADACHE. I AM NOW ON MY SECOND DAY AND STILL FEEL VERY TIRED AND WEAK. I ALWAYS AM LOOKING AT THE CLOCK TO SEE IF I CAN EAT YET. THE BOOK SOUNDS GREAT WHEN I WAS READING IT BUT NOW I AM WONDERING IF FEELING LIKE THIS IS WORTH IT. I KEEP TELLING MYSELF THAT MY BODY IS JUST TRYING TO GET USE TO THIS TYPE OF EATING AND THINGS WILL START TO GET BETTER. MY BIGEST PROBLEM IS COMMING UP WITH IDEAS OF WHAT TO MAKE. THE BOOK LACKS ON RECIPES FOR PHASE 1. I WILL WRITE AGAIN AFTER MY 9 DAY DETOX IF I MAKE IT THAT LONG...... UNTIL THEN
5,THIS WORKS FOR DIABETICS TOO!!!,"I have been a diabetic for many years. I have had difficulty controlling my blood sugars and finding a program that would work for me. My doctor has put me on everything to lose weight and nothing has worked with my diabetes. A girlfriend of mine from Arizona told me about this book, so I got it immediately. She lost 27 pounds in two months and said it was the best thing since sliced bread. So I went out and tried and I have lost 20 pounds in just 6 weeks. Even better, my blood sugars have been in the best control ever and my doctor is talking about lowering my medications if I can keep everything going. This plan is flexible and allows you to make subsitutions and the recipes in the back of the book are wonderful and easy-to-cook. The books says that it's a diet for everyone, and I have to agree. It really lives up to the hype!!"
5,It works!!,"I know there are hundreds of diet fads out there, but this book is not one of them. I read this book cover to cover before I began, and was actually super excited to start. In my first week, I losrt 7lbs, and by the end of the 3rd week, I was down 15lbs. 15lbs in 3 weeks??!!! Insanity!! After the 3rd week(the maintenance phase), I just utilized the book as a goog to making better food choices. That was a year ago, and I have still managed to keep the weight off. I continue to eat better, excercise and make lifestyle changes and this book was a great guide. Thank you!"
4,Straightforward,"I found this book to be concise and the diet recommendations easy to follow. I've gone down one clothing size since I started the diet several weeks ago-yaaay! I think the book could provide more specific information, but the website/Yahoo Fat Smash Group have helped to fill in the few (and minor) gaps in the book."
3,average,"I did lose weight with this book, but i really felt alone in Phase I in the beginning..It's true that it's very short and sounds rushed and he does not give enough details in the book..especially the exercises..i wish he gave out more information, such as muscle straining if you don't rest or what reasons he says you shouldn't weight train till much more later in the book..i'd like to know why..but i did lose a little..so i'll give it a 3"
3,Fat Smash,"I'm not sure how much fat reading this book has smashed, but it did provide me with excellent guidance on developing and maintaining a healthy eating lifestyle."
3,No beer for 90+ days ... ouch!,"As an author of several books on weight loss, and a successful ""dieter"" my self (I lost 114 pounds last year!), this book has one major flaw. While the diet is great, in theory, and will work, a great majority of people in the world could never adhere to it, as it forbids the consumption of alcoholic beverages.Please understand that 86% of adult Americans partake in recreational drinking, and it would be extremely unlikely to ask the general population to follow this degree of discipline.This diet WILL WORK for those who have the willpower! I like Ian's last book much better, though!"
3,The Fat Smash Diet,It's ok - but unrealistic in my opinion. I was all excited about it - but I will probably just give it away.
3,"Excellent plan, confusing book!","This is a simple plan which works. I am rigth now on phase 3 and have lost around 10 lbs. It's easy and you don't suffer from hunger. BUT, the book has some mistakes between the guidelines and the recipes. I read in the yahoo group that Dr. Ian didn't review the recipes before the book was published !!! Besides that, I wrote 2 e-mails to Dr. Ian but never got any answer. As I advance in the plan I have MANY doubts, which I find a little bit frustrating. I think the next edition will be a lot better if Dr. Ian incorporates all the missing information."
5,Excellent,"I read this entire book I believe this book contains good information to help lose weight, and maintain the weight loss."
4,Not too long,"After reading so many diet books, this one was a pleasure. Short and sweet.So many other books take forever to get into and this one was every basicand easy to follow."
4,Great book!,This book is really easy to read and gives you a step by step guide to be successful in losing weight and redesigning your eating habits.
3,seems as though it contradicts itself,"I've been thinking about starting this diet, but there are some things that confuse me. Mainly, in phase 1, Dr. Smith lists juice and cheese as things that are not allowed. However, in the reciepe section for phase 1, it suggests having (for breakfast) a cantaloupe with low-fat yogurt and ORANGE JUICE (p61). Then, for the tasty tomato, it says to use 4 tbsp of grated parmesan CHEESE (p76). Can someone exmplain these contradictions?"
5,I'm a big fan of The Fat Smash Diet Club.,I learned about this diet on VH1's Celebrity Fit Club. I was excited that I got a chance to get it. It works! I'm losing weight by the buckets. I will be a fan of Dr. Ian and this diet forever! God sent him and his diet to me!!!
5,This Diet Is The One,"Scratch the other diets. I've tried them all and none of them work like this one. Where has this diet been all of my life. It makes so much sense and more importantly, it's CHEAP!!! This is a full program that will change your life!!!"
3,book,My order arrived in a timely manner however I thought the book was in fair condition. Some of the pages were folded along with the book cover.
2,Recipe Book?,"The book is composed of about 70% recipes. The ""meat"" of the book is really basic with charts here and there to make even that seem just a little longer than it really is. Nothing special =/"
2,Don't bother!,"I completed one day of Phase I. While I lost two pounds in that one day, I have no intention of continuing on this program. This was absolute torture! By the end of the day, I felt like I was going out of my mind! I also felt horrible, physically. My stomach felt hollowed out and I felt as though I had no energy. There has got to be a better way!"
3,I have to wonder...,"Anyone else notice how just about all these reviews are written by people (yes, myself included) that have written just ONE review??? And so many were posted right around the time of the book's release.That just seems to be a bit of a coincidnce. I hope I am wrong and that the book is worth it and helps those who buy it.By the way, I gave the book 3 stars cause i had to rate it. Out of fairness I thought I'd go in the middle range."
3,Fat Smash Not Best Choice for Vegetarians,"This book takes an extremely common-sense approach to dieting and exercise and has forgiveness built in to the program, both of which are nice features. However, the ""detox"" portion of the program essentially involves being veggie, which I already am, so there wasn't actually a big change for me, especially once you get past the detox. I wished that Dr. Ian would have had more sections where he was speaking, since he's actually pretty funny, but the book's really short and the majority of it is lists of what you can or can't eat as well as the recipes. Probably a really good diet book for meat-eaters."
