2,A better alternative,"While I'm a firm believer that everything has it's place, I believe that my wife came up with a better/cheaper alternative than simplehuman. Empty Kleenex or tissue dispensers work perfectly. Only one bag comes out at a time, and they come in enough sizes/colors/patterns to match any decor."
2,Incorrect mounting hardware,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the peel off tape strips on this unit will not hold it in place for very long. Additionally, the screws provided to mount the unit are too small. The screw head is not wide enough in diameter to securely hold the unit.Several customers have complained about this yet the manufacturer continues to include incorrect hardware.Not impressed.On a positive note, this item is made in Taiwan and NOT in China. Amazing!"
4,actually,"I don't even NEED this wall mount grocery bag holder. Wanna know why? I have something else instead- a cotton bag holder shaped and designed like a punching bag that's attached on a string (and a hook) beside the trash can in the kitchen. This takes up WAY less room and you can store the same kind of plastic grocery bags that are described for this specific bag holder here on amazon. I'd rather use what I have since it takes up less room, but hey, maybe you're a customer just looking for whatever kind of holder you can get and willing to spend a few extra dollars for something like this. By all means buy this wall mount bag holder if you're in such a predicament but remember- there's alternatives."
3,Get what you paid for!,FAlls off wall all the time and they other hook up you are forced to put holes in the wall than the product still falls off the wall! Great Idea find a new way to place it!
1,mount part not the best,"so i recently moved. in my old place i had this product and had purchased it from bed bath and beyond. it was fabulous, worked great and held many of my bags. upon moving i decided it was simpler and easier to order it from amazon.com - firstly it arrived with out screws and the tape appears old and will not stick to my wall. since i have already opened this package i have to keep it, but i'm gonna throw it out because its useless and falls off my wall all the time! (i even added additional double sided tape and this has not worked, and since it didn't come with screws i can't even screw this into the wall...)bottom line: better to go to the store and by it, where if needed to return could be quicker and easier then through amazon."
5,"What a great looking, well made item","Length:: 1:01 MinsI got this on a whim because I kept looking at all the bags in my pantry. This was a good looking choice that was easy to install. It was well made and worth the small cost. I would recommend it to you for your kitchen or pantry.simplehuman Wall Mount Grocery Bag Holder, Brushed Stainless Steel"
3,"Stylish, but doesn't stick","I would love this bag holder, except that I cannot get it to stick to anything. The problem is not the adhesive strips provided, but the design of the unit itself - the plastic back bows out, pushing against any mounting surface. This causes it to pry itself loose after a few hours, no matter what type of tape or glue that you use.If you plan on mounting it using the provided screws, it will probably work great for you, but otherwise I would avoid it in favor of something lighter and more foolproof."
4,definitely satisfied,a neat way to keep the plastic shopping bags that seem to accumulate. Used to put the plastic bags into another plstic bag and hang on a door knob in laundry room.Now I have the Bag Holder attached to the laundry room door and it is perfect. Neatly stores the plastic bags. Love shopping at Amazon.
4,Removal,I can't get this thing off the wall!!! LOL It works great but Im moving and I can't get it off the wall!!!
1,"Pretty looking, utterly useless","Am I the only one who likes the name of the company ""simplehuman""? A definite marketing win. Unfortunately, this product doesn't really deliver (incidently, not the first time I've been let down by simplehuman items). Attached it to the wall, and it fell down after a couple of weeks. Re-attached. 2 weeks. Re-attached (using different method). 1 week. This went on for several months until it fell, mortally wounded, by the water heater in my laundry closet. Didn't pick it up until I moved house last month. Ended up in the dump.PS. Also, really doesn't hold many bags...couldn't keep up with the amount we accumulate in my 2-person household."
5,Just what I needed!,"This is absolutely PERFECT for storing those plastic grocery bags! I mounted this to my wall with the screws. There is double-sided tape included, but it is extremely thin and not sticky enough to hold this securely to any surface and pull/push bags in and out of. The screws were included. Highly recommend this!"
4,Nice bag holder. Does the trick!,"Very pleased with this Simplehuman bag holder. Looks very nice and sleek. Simple to use and have no problems inserting or removing plastic bags. Deducted one star because the adhesive isn't the greatest. It fell down from the wall in the middle of the night and crashed to the floor, causing me to run downstairs expecting to see burglars. But luckily there were no robbers and the item didn't suffer any knicks or dents. Simple & effective."
5,amazon,excellent product and received on time. I would recommend this item to someone else. it works well. thank you very much for your product
3,Works well if you can use screws,"This didn't work well for me because I don't want to screw it into any of my cabinets. But if you're willing to use the screws, I think this is great. It looks nice, holds a lot of bags, and is a good deal."
5,Grocery Bag Holder,"This is a great solution to all the plastic bags you get at the grocery store, from fast food places, etc. The unit mounts easily on the wall or inside a cabinet or pantry with either screws and/or two sided tape which is included. I mounted mine on a wall in the corner of my kitchen. It matches my appliance well. It holds a lot of bags, more than it states on the box. The only thing is, I have switched over to reusable bags a while back, so this doesn't get too much use any more. It only has a couple of bags in it now. I am looking for other uses for it. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know. Thanks!"
3,Included hardware not good,"I bought two of these and both came with screws that had smaller heads than the keyhole slots in the back of the unit. A trip to the hardware store for a couple properly sized washers solved the problem, but should the customer need to do that? The keyhole slots are huge, so most folks will not have screws of the right size for this. The unit works pretty well for holding and dispensing bags."
5,Recommended,"I've looked for months for a plastic grocery bag holder without any luck, so I ordered it immediately when I saw it. It seems sturdy and was easy to hang with it's adhesive back. It's easy to put the bags in and take them out. Finally!!"
5,Handy Little Storage Device,This is definitely a very handy storage device. This holds an amazing amount of bags and keeps the usual bag storage area much cleaner and available for something else.
5,Awesome!,"We used to just cram those plastic bags you'd get from WalMart, etc., in the cabinet for storage. It wasn't tidy, but I use one or two every day for emptying cat litter, so it was fine. When my husband saw this, he wanted to try it -- SO GLAD WE DID!! Fairly inexpensive and relatively easy to mount (we mounted our inside the lower cabinet), this is a very NEAT and sleek way to store those bags. I love it!!"
4,finally organized,This is a great product at a good price. I hung it in my garage just outside my kitchen door and replaced several bags of bags I've been stepping over.
4,Neat and easy,"This product is worth the little amount spent to clean up a bag problem in a kitchen pantry. It's simply made, but small enough to mount just about anywhere in a pantry, and it really works. The only problem is if you don't have a wall stud to hit the screws are useless, and even if you can mount it on a stud, the screw head is to small to actually hold the bag holder against the wall. Plastic wall tap-ins and larger headed screws (or washers) should be included in the package, but otherwise it does its job.....it gets the bags off the floor or off a shelf to provide more room for can goods in the pantry."
1,"Won't stay up with the tape, holds only ~2/3 of advertised capacity","I prepped the areas as directed, and the thing won't stay up with the tape strips provided. It stayed on just long enough for me to have recycled the packaging it came in, and so I likely can't return it and get my money back. I tried mounting it on a cabinet door, then once that fell off, to the underside of a cabinet shelf, but it fell off again. Also, it only held 20 bags as opposed to the ""up to 30"" as advertised. Only holding 2/3 of the advertised number is not ok with me. Overall, very disappointed."
1,"Ugh, no sticky...",This item is a great idea..if the sticky worked. I've had to replace the stick tape with my own. Blerg. Really annoying to keep having to stick it back up.
2,V-E'd to within an inch (mm) of its useful life.,"I bought this bag holder because I had other items to buy anyway, and it solves a problem that currently, I simply don't have a weekend to solve myself. While attractive and sized reasonably well, any sturdy box with two holes cut in it will fill this function. For me, with two cats to clean up after, its a touch on the small side, but I'll live with it.However, my inspiration for writing this review came from my experience installing the holder on a wood cabinet door. First, I noticed that the sheet metal used to craft the body is tissue-thin; not a problem for retaining bags, but clearly it can be dented easily. Second, as I hand-tightened the screws (after drilling pilot holes I might add) I accidentally twisted the heads off. That's right, hand-tightening - twisted the heads off the screws. Wood door. This is my first simple human product purchase and it will be my last due to its cheap craftsmanship. C'mon, guys!"
2,Good design but it didn't work for me,"I want to concur with the other comments about problems with this dispenser holding to a surface using adhesive. I think it has something to do with the surface to which it's being attached, the adhesive used, and the fact that you press down when you insert bags and pull out when you remove them.When the supplied double-sided adhesive gave out (after a few weeks) I tried several different brands of double-sided tape. Nothing worked.If I could have used screws then this would be perfect. Unfortunately the doors and sides of my cabinets are too thin for them to work well.If you have some place where you can screw this down then it will be a perfect dispenser. If you will need to depend on adhesive then (as you can see from this and other reviews) some times it will work and some times it won't."
3,Needs more capacity,"It's too small to contain as many bags as one would like, but it certainly is convenient to have for storage."
5,My friends like it... I like it too,I get comments from visitors and they all ask me where I got it. It works great and I really like it. I recommend mounting it to the wall because there is some stress when pulling the bags out. It is a fingerprint magnet but not that bad. I find it really useful.
2,Self adhesive is terrible quality,"I mounted this using the self-adhesive strips that are on the holder, and after a couple months I found it had toppled to the floor and the plastic cracked. It seems wrong to pay this much money for a grocery bag holder and the self-adhesive doesn't work. Better to buy the $2 one from Ikea!"
4,Neat Idea,This very nice and sleek stainless steel mount sticks to all walls. Great way to keep those plastic bags in a one place.
4,Great Grocery Bag Holder,This has been a great organizational tool and my bags aren't all over the place anymore. It's strong and sturdy.
1,NO NO NO NO. Do not buy this!!!,"Horrible. This thing falls off the wall constantly, it is hard to stuff bags in and hard to get them out. NO WAY does it hold the amount of bags it says.... after 20 they are in there so tight the thing just flings off the wall from all your PULLING. Plus, you have to hold it down with the other hand which just gets finger prints all over it. I am going to buy one of those simple fabric holders my mom used to have. Those held a ton of bags and it was easy to work it. Just hang the tube from a hook, simple. Save your time and money on this one....unless you are only looking for the ""Bling bling"" and could care less about it actually holding bags that you are going to need in the future. Oh yeah, I tried the sticky tape vs the screws and it pulled the paint off my pantry door. Nice! Thanks a lot Simplehuman!"
5,Great bag holder and attractive!,"I have other bag holders for other areas of the home, and they're cheaper, but sure are unattractive. Sure this is 5x the price, but it's nice to look at and the metal is stylish. It can hold more than 30 grocery type bags and easily dispenses. The tape method didn't stay on so we hardware mounted it. And a 10 year warranty to boot, it must be made well. I love it!"
4,Not very sticky,"The only problem I have with this is it keeps falling off the wall in our pantry. I was trying to avoid putting holes in the wall and just use the provided adhesive, but I guess we're going to have to use the hardware instead."
4,Hate clutter?,"I got this for several reasons(1) I wanted to get something to sort the unruly bag mess - I used to fold the bags and put them into a bin - husband on the other hand didn't think that was a good use of time(2) he wanted something that ""matched"" every other appliance in the home - I didn't care because it was going inside the cabinet door(3) I wanted to get my mess in order and have something that the hubby would useIt's not going to change your life.It will give all those plastic bags a homeDOsuse the screw and screw it into your door - the tape/adhesive mounts are worthless. SO make sure that you DO want to screw this into a door - if not, move onto another product that has hooks that hangs on the doorDON'Tsoverstuff every single bag into this thing. When it's super overflowing full, it gets to be a little battle to pull the bags outI do wish it was flatter and wider so it doesn't take up 'space' in the cabinet. It's about a size of kleenex box (200ct)."
5,Simplehuman Grocery Bag Holder,This product is of simple design and function. Just stuff the bags in the oblong openning and pull them out of the top - It worked quite well to clean up the space between my counter and refrigerator where I used to store/stuff all my grocery bags~ It comes with two adhesive strips on the back of it so putting it up is very easy - it also comes with a hanger if you want to do it that way - but it is pretty light weight and so are grocery bags so the adhesive strips worked just fine. I put it on the inside of my very narrow broom utility closet door and it fits perfectly....out of the way and out of sight!
5,Finally a stylish (& simple) solution for grocery bags!,"I first saw this grocery bag holder at my folks place about 1 year ago and it fit perfectly and discreetly inside their cabinet door. Given that I recently moved to a new apartment (and I'm a procrastinator), I finally purchased the bag holder to help me get more organized around the kitchen. Additionally, I now have to use grocery bags as my trash bags (since I live in a hi-rise and the trash chute only takes small bags), so this is the perfect storage container for grocery bags. I also purchased the simple human trash can (simplehuman Grocery Bag Trash Can, Stainless Steel) to replace my old white trash can and put the grocery bags to work. Now if only simplehuman had a product to help with my cooking skills...."
4,Practical and compact,A simple and practical box to store and dispense grocery bags. It helps to keep them organized and neat when trying to recycle or get more use out of each plastic bag.
3,"Looks nice, falls down","I love the way it looks and how it organizes under the counter but it keeps falling down. I used the sticky strip and for some reason it keeps falling down. I cleaned it before hand and it stayed up for a while but now it keeps falling down. Other than that, it is nice but the point is to have it attached to the cabinet door."
5,Fantastic,"I love my bag holder- it's thin enough that it fits into my broom closet; and even if it didn't fit into my closet- it's ""pretty"" so I wouldn't need to hide it- use the screws that are provided- don't just rely on the double sided tape!!"
5,Very functional and tidy,"For those of us that like to save and reuse grocery bags, this is he perfect solution to keep all the bag clutter tidy. It mounts nicely on the wall, and can hold plenty of bags. This is a very elegant and easy to use solution for keeping all the bags wrangled and accessible."
5,excellent storage,This is an excellent item. I was so impressed with it that I ordered another one for the computer room. Would highly recommend.
4,Good product easy to install,"This is a nice product for the price. Way better than the cloth or plastic, cheap-looking holders. We really like the look. Husband said it was an easy install into our basement stairway."
5,Tidies up the Clutter,Such a simple little product but takes care of all my mess of grocery bags that used to be just wadded under the sink - so I actually have storage space down there once more. And it even goes nicely with all my stainless appliances around the kitchen. Such a nice little product!
1,Useless and keep falling from the wall,This is the most disappointed Simplehuman product. I attached it on the wall and it keeps FALLING down! It keeps my life not SIMPLE!My recommendation is: Don't buy this!
2,Won't stay up,"I have not tried screwing this in to the wall, but the adhesive strips on it do NOT hold it up. I put it under my counter, and it falls down several times a day."
4,Great product,Saves me so much space when you look at how I used to store my grocery bags.The ONLY con is:I wish it could store MORE bags.
3,does its job,I wish to mount it but it's too much work since I'm in an apartment and the landlord my complain when I leave.
5,"Love it, just a bit big.","I was really happy to find something to store all my gazillion grocery bags that pile up. It is a bit bulky, but does the job very well."
2,Not worth it!,This is not a good buy. The tape sent to keep it on the wall does not work properly. I would not recommend this product.
5,Love this plastic bag holder,"I had to have this after seeing all of the great reviews on it and I'm so happy I ordered it. I mounted mine inside my pantry door to combat my previous way of storing them, which was crammed in the bottom of the pantry...not so tidy. So, I used a level to get it straight on the door and marked the 2 places to drill the screws, drilled in the screws, hung the dispenser on them, and I was done. It was really that simple. It looks sleek and functions well. I did as another reviewer suggested and wrapped each bag around my hand one at a time before putting it in the top, so that I would only get one bag out when I needed it. I highly recommend this product=)"
4,Plastic bag holder,I just got this yesterday and it looks good and very light. If you have the expertise you can build one your self but it is worth the 12 dollars I paid for. Yes I recommend it to a friend.
4,it holds the bags,It a little big to put inside a closet space. EZ to install I just used the peel off strip in the back holds very good if it falls off then I'll screw it in. They are outlawing plastic bags here in SoCal so I may not need it for a long time.
2,Dated material,"It is helpful, but after reading it, I believe i knew as much and more before reading it. It does have a lot of helpful pictures. Good for a begining detailist. Dated material."
3,easy reading,this book offers good advice to the newly appointed fire officers/acting officers for fire incident managment.
3,"Incident Management for the Street-Smart Fire Officer, 2nd Edition (Hardcover","Has alot of good info, but there is a lot of rambling. There needs to be a proof reader imployed by the publisher. There are numberous mistakes with simple grammer . Spell check worked , but the wrong words were chosen."
4,Includes Bonus Enhanced CD,2nd Disc Includes:1. Blue Hour (Home Recordings)2. Self Help (SBN Session)3. Long Distance (SBN Session)4. Bright Golden Lights (Home Recordings)& Ether Song EPK Video
3,SciFi Mystery,"This here's an odd little book. It's a rather mannered SciFi mystery told in old fashioned prose that's laced with a good bit of wit. As I was reading it, I kept thinking it would make a great movie if it was adapted by Tim Lebbon and directed by David Lynch. I understand it's supposed to be Jack Vance-like, but I've never read him, so I took this book on it's own merits, and I came away thinking it's ok, but I didn't love it, but I'd might consider reading more of Luff Imbry. He's an very memorable and entertaining charlatan."
3,Dumbed down for the average reader,"The book contains really basic information that is not a new revelation. For a better book on the subject read ""Action Learning in Action: Transforming Problems and People for World-Class Organizational Learning""; Michael J. Marquardt. Marquardt's is slightly better and provides better real life examples."
3,"Good content, but what's new?","This is a terrific book if you have no idea how best to train people in a corporate environment. But if you do, then this book is old news. The ideas and concepts are absolutely right, but unfortunately the authors try to imply they invented this method and no one else has ever done it. I currently work for a training company, and we have used all of these techniques for years. In fact, many of the authors' examples are over 10 years old. On the other hand, let me repeat that the authors' educational techniques are right. But they never went into enough detail to really tell a company how to do it themselves. I wonder why? They need to tone down the sales job. At the end of the book, I wanted to get an unlisted telephone number to keep them from calling to sell me Action Learning techniques."
3,"Weird, but not boring","This movie was definitely not the best I've seen, but not the worst either. I thought it was a cheap version of Cheaper By The Dozen, which I didn't like very much. (Don't ask me why I decided to see both Cheaper By The Dozen 2 and Yours, Mine, and Ours if I didn't like them.) The movie was still fun, though. I strongly advise that if you didn't like Cheaper By The Dozen, then don't see this movie!"
1,this is a really stupid movie. Only watch it if you are already intoxicated.,"Premise completely unbelievable. ""antics"" either predictable or totally uninteresting or both. Quade is phoning it in, and yet manages to be the best part of the film so you figure that out."
3,Fun and a bit thought-provoking,"Here's a remake of the 1968 version that I've never seen. But in today's world where it's hard to choose something family-appropriate without being silly, Yours, Mine, and Ours really is for all of us. The plot is a pretty simple Brady Bunch mixed family, with some Dharma & Greg seasoning. If you want real thought, and beauty, go watch The Sound of Music. But if you want to get out of the video store with a DVD you can enjoy, and your young teen still talking to you, go for this friendly family love story. Free extra: in among the 16 kids are 2/3 of the stars of Drake & Josh."
2,Where do I start?,"Ok, I admit I really got this because I'm a big fan of Dennis Quaid and Sean Faris. That said, I can also honestly say that I'm glad I didn't go to the theaters for this because I would have demanded my money back. This film tries too hard for the cute factor and gets corny and cheesy in places where it should be heartfelt. I don't buy for a moment that the kids bonded in such a quick way that felt forced. I thought the racially mixed North kids were an interesting aspect but I'm sorry to say that was the only thing really interesting about the whole picture. I believe had they stayed with the original storyline of the 1968(?) film it would have been a much more entertaining film. On the plus side, the camera seems to love Faris (who wouldn't?) and it's nice to see he gets a lot of screen time. This doesn't compare to the original; Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda are priceless and keep the film going unlike Russo and Quaid. So sad."
3,Family Movie you will love,If you liked The Parent Trap with Dennis Quaid you will love this. He is a comical guy in this movie. The kids make their parents life miserable. It is funny and parents can relate.
2,Just another pointless remake,"Man is Hollywood reaching. This is one movie I thought they would never remake, and I was wrong, save your money and go rent the Original with Lucy. Rene can not fill her shoes, I don't know why shes even trying. Not that shes a bad actress, its just she doesnt really fit the role. The remake is coming from a guy whos first movie directed was Home Alone 3, so be affraid, be very affraid.Why can't people spend more time making something new and original. Comedies like this are outdated and lame. There are too many characters to even care about. Dennis Quad why can't you make cool movies again like Inner Space and the epic The Right Stuff, or even Frequency. Rene, stick to something less cute and less annoying.The annoying trailer should have already frightened you from this bomb. Its like they are trying too hard to make this one work. I just dont see it."
2,Maybe two and a half,"The ten year olds thought it was ""okay"" and the four and five year old just wanted to know when it was time to go home. Better save this one for the rental list. It's an okay family movie for the middle age range, but younger kids and older teens won't really want to sit through it.As for grown ups, well, it aint no chick flick, so don't think your doing your babe any favors by taking her to see this, espically if you got a baby sitter or something, cause all the commotion will make you wish you stayed at home. And guys, well, like I mentioned at the start here, I took four kids to the theather to see it, so because of the popcorn and m&m;'s I'm an alright guy, but don't think you're treating anyone to anything special here, it's cliches and silly humor that's been done over and over again."
1,Big Disappointment,"I was really disappointed in this movie. I didn't expect Russo or Quaid to be a Lucille Ball or Henry Fonda, but beyond the title there is nothing similar to the original movie. No courting, no oatmeal sandwich and where's the ""ours""? Kids were out of control. Russo portrays a very permissive mother -- no discipline, just love, while Quaid is over the top running it like a ship. While watching it I kept thinking it has to get better -- it can't get worse -- but it never got any better. It was a waste of money and space in my DVD collection can't even find anyone to give it to!"
3,Good for a laugh!,"Yes, Yours, Mine & Ours is full of slapstick, predictable conflicts, and, with 18 child actors,... too many so-so actors in the room at the same time.But it was still funny. The bit parts with the nanny all worked. I even enjoyed many of the scenes with the pig!The sailing was great. Speaking of sailing... how about a YM&O; II, sailing around the world?"
1,Way Too Over the Top...,"I mean seriously...maybe the whole mom with 3 kids and dad with 3 kids colliding as one family worked for the Brady Bunch...but having a mom with 6 kids and a dad with 6 kids colliding as one is just a big, unrealistic circus, not to mention irresponsible! With so many kids in one house, it's nearly impossible to look at them as being funny or clever. It's just ridiculous and over the top, not to mention annoying. There's absolutely NOTHING funny about this whole concept, it's just utterly ridiculous and inane."
1,This Is Really Bad,"One of the worst movies I've seen in years. Predictable, stupid, I felt ripped off.This is not even worth waiting for DVD. Just forget about this one. It should never have been made."
3,Pleasant but more farfetched the the 1968 original,"This film recast Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda with Rene Russo and Dennis Quaid. Ironically, even though the 1968 version starred two iconic legends in 1968, the remake seemed more farfetched and broad.Dennis Quaid played a higher ranking officer who still had plenty of time for his kids and Rene Russo appeared as a quintessential successful businesswoman who also balanced a lot of time bonding with her kids and a talking stick -- and looked fantabulous.In the original, Henry Fonda played a career military man who had little time for his family until his wife's death forced him to get to know his somewhat resentful children and Lucille Ball played a military nurse. So much for the ""phoney, fakey Hollywood"" of yesterday as opposed to the ""more relatable, honest"" Hollywood of today.That said, even though it did not compare favorably overall to the original, the new Yours Mine and Ours was entertaining. The audio commentary and extras were very good."
5,"Lots of Kids, Lots of Laughts","This movie is a remake of a Lucille Ball, Henry Fonda movie.Dennis Quaid plays a navy man with eight children that re-meets his high school sweetheart played by Renee Russo who has 10 children.The pair decides to get married and merge their households.Easier said than done. He is an orderly type person and she is more laid back. Add to that the fact that the two sets of children don't like each other and don't want to live together you get a recipe for disaster.It is a very cute, funny movie and the acting is very good."
2,"What a takeoff on ""Cheaper by the Dozen!!""","CBTD is soo much better and funnier than this! I thought ""Yours, Mine & Ours"" was totally predictable (like this story line hasn't been used to death!), not funny and sappy. That part about the ""beautiful lighthouse keeper""?! GAG! The odds of both parents being widows is slim to none and the families were so unrealistic! Renee Russo having white kids,a black kid, asian kids AND Indian kids is soooo unrealistically stupid! Watch CBTD or CBTD 2 if you want a good movie."
2,Meh,"This movie had a few cute moments, mostly in the beginning. I felt like the ending was rushed...almost like ""omg, we have to keep this movie under 110 minutes...so let's somehow compress 30 minutes of film into 8-10 minutes."""
2,Disappointing,"I had been looking forward to this movie for a long time and I'm glad that I did not go to see it in theaters. I am very glad about that. However, I did rent it. I thought that it would be a hilarious movie much like Cheaper by the Dozen. Instead, it was just really poor. It seems like the comedy was missed in several areas. True, I did get a laugh or two out of the pig and stuff, but it was not that funny, and it was a disappointment of what I had expected. I am glad I didn't see it in theaters; but I can honestly say that I probably won't be watching it again because it's pretty lame. I don't really see how it could appeal to any genre of audience..."
2,"Corny, Predictable, Blah.....","Don't bother with this unfunny, predictable, boring, pedestrian, fingerpainted drivel. The piggy stole the show."
2,Middling remake,"I'm a Dennis Quaid fan. And I'm a Rene Russo fan. I'm not a huge fan of ""Yours, Mine & Ours"".I mean, the film was cute and all, but way too crammed, and by nature of having 16 kids involved, not a lot of character development, and not an ensemble piece. Plus, there are some rather offensive stereotypes with some of the characters.There are bright moments, and some clever scenes, but this is a bubble gum and popcorn movie -- fun, but ultimately flavorless.I did like Sean Faris, and there's one almost Tom Cruise ""Taps"" freeze frame moment with him that surprised me."
2,An Inferior Remake!,"I wouldn't consider this a really bad film. But I couldn't fault it for not trying. It did have some potential. The updated story now takes place in New London, Connecticut; not San Francisco. And, there are some adopted kids of all ethnicities, which made perfect sense in this day and age. The problem lies in the one thing that makes all films like this faulter, the screnplay. There are very few laughs aside from trying to make the dad look like a complete imbecile in slapstick moments. Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo struggle to put the film together. All in all, this was a huge disappointment. You're better off with the Lucille Ball/Henry Fonda original."
4,Great Comedy to Watch with the Kids,"Although ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" won't be winning any awards for outstanding comedy, I think that the movie does a good job targeting families with a movie they can feel comfortable watching with children. Frank (Dennis Quaid) and Helen (Rene Russo) rekindle a high school romance and marry bringing their two families of 18 total children together. The children have been raise is completely different manors prior to the marriage and they refuse to adjust to their new lifestyle as a family. Children will enjoy watching and laugh at the pranks the kids in the movie play on each other and then on their parents in an effort to break them up. The plot line is predictable but, if you're looking for a movie to watch with kids, then laughs you enjoy as a family more than makes up for the plot."
2,Nowhere Near the Original,"Maybe this movie would have been better had I not seen the original. This one lost so much trying for slapstick comedy instead of family feelings. Little attention was given to the parents falling in love and the bond that they shared. All of a sudden they were married (without telling their kids?) and the rest of the movie was aimed towards ridiculous antics with the children. I kept wondering when the Children's Welfare people were going to come in and take the children. Perhaps leaving them with the drunk babysitter was supposed to be funny, but it was downright scary.Stick with the original on this movie!"
3,Disappointed,"I might be young, 24, but I have to admit that the original was better. This was cute, but...they seemed to change some of the best moments from the original. Rent, don`t buy."
2,Eh...,"This is not a good film by any stretch, although I'll admit the stupid comedy amused me at times. But like Cheaper By the Dozen before it, this is pointless, uninspired remake of a classic movie.Dennis Quaid has a reputation of being a good actor who often picks the worst films to appear in and lo and behold, he does it again here. Rene Russo and a few other notable actors get to taint their resumes as well.If there is one thing I really like its Danielle Panabaker. She's just plain cute! I would'nt mind seeing her appear in something good again.Darkhorse86"
5,Love bluegrass,"If you like bluegrass for an oldies songs, get this. I like it alot. It worth listening to it while driving on a trip."
4,Great Value,"I bought this player because it will play DivX off of flash drives and I wanted to watch PAL DVD's.I was leary about Philips players but once I hooked it up I was surprised the picture quality is good,the picture controls are a nice feature also.The chassis is 17"" wide x 8"" deep x 1.5"" high.The player fits nicely in my entertainment rack and it matches my other components.Pros:PicturePricePicture controlsPlays DivXStylePlays MP3 and WMA.Region freeDVD resumePlays NTSC/PALCons:RemoteDisplay doesn't dimFlimsy trayNo S-Video or optical portHow to make region free:Press Setupselect the Preference tabPress 1,3,8,9,3,1Press up/down key to select ""0""and hit menu to exit."
3,Nice DVD Player but sluggish,"I bought this to replace a conventional Samsung DVD player. It is slow in responding. When I power ON and try to insert a disk, I have to wait about 30 seconds before the drawer slides open. Sometimes I have to turn the unit OFF and re-start it. I use the RGB output, so video looks good."
5,I love it!!!!!!!!!,"Hi, I don't usally take the time to write about stuff I buy, buttt, I had to. This unit is great for all of you down loaders that get your movies on divx (know what I mean!). This unit is great I hooked up a 750 gig hard drive to the usb port and I have about 90 movies on it. It has the capacity to store approx 600-1000 movies, (if your movies are divx and aprox 750mgs to 1.2gigs depending on the encoder). Anyway, with this set up I have a jukebox of movies that I can wathch at anytime and never have to load or unload a dvd. The movies are very fluid and don't jerk or pause. The only time you will get that jerk and pause action is if the drive needs to be defragmented. Oh yea you have to format the drive fat 32. The unit plays every format that I have thrown at it except one xvid formant (don't ask me why) but I recomend it whole heartedly, for any video enthusiast. Anyway, thanks for listing!"
5,Awesome DVD player!,This thing is great! The main reason for this purchase was for the USB port. It is not included in the description but you can play video files through it. It plays just like if it were a DVD. Very rarely do you see any skipping. I have not used the up converting on this player since I do not have an HDTV yet but that will be a nice feature sometime in the future.The only con I can think of(which isn't even that bad) is that the dvd tray is very slow to respond when you open it.Some people may complain that there is no eject button on the remote but if you hold down the stop button for a few seconds it will open the tray.
4,Great for the price!,"This is excellent for the price. You can view pretty much any video format you burn on a CD- avi,mov,mpg,jpg,etc. The usb 2.0 port is a huge bonus. I load tons of movies onto my 300gb external HD and play them thru the usb port on the dvd player."
4,another good philips,"I get it for the DivX capabilities. The remote is a bit of a PITA, and the menus are kinda shabby, but for the price, not bad."
2,"thanks, but no thanks","I purchased this dvd player to replace a really nice GE. Yes, this will play a photo cd and it is very slim and light. But the bad parts are this - it is kind of slow to start up. If you stop or pause the dvd for over 3 minutes the whole thing shuts down. If it doesn't like the TV you connect it to you will have a 1-3"" distortion all along the top of your screen. I'd return it if I could and just get a cheapie that would last until I upgrade to HD cable and new tellie."
5,great product,"Philips DVP5982 1080p Upscaling DVD Playergreat produt at this price,its highly recommdede."
5,Lots of Bang for the Buck,This is a great buy. I have yet to see any of the negative attributes listed in previous comments on this device manifest themselves in reality. Fast forward and rewind work just fine. The media loads up quickly from my flash memory stick. The picture quality is awesome. You simply cannot beat this level of performance in the $60 price range.
4,Good product to hold you over...,"This is an awesome DVD if your current one is out of date and you need a new one and you aren't ready to choose sides in the Blue Ray/HDDVD war...The best part about it is the ability to read Divx and many other file formats, without having to encode DVD's into standard DVD format...Plus the ability to pop your USB flash drive in and play your movies directly...That being said, it has it's drawbacks, which arent enough to give it a bad rating..The upconversion is not as good as I thought...but I think that's a limitation of all upconverting DVD players....I just got a 40inch LCD and was disappointed with my old DVD's performance...I was hoping this would make it better, so I don't have to buy a bluray/hddvd but it did not improve video quality that much..even with a HDMI cable... I think you just can't expect miracles when you buy the latest and greatest TV ..hahaha"
1,You get what you pay for...,This product is terrible. The controls are extremely slow to respond. After you turn it on there is time to mix a cocktail and come back before it actually shows signs of life. I have had this player for five months and now it will not work at all.
2,DivX files stutter HORRIBLY,"Do not buy this ""Ultra DivX-certified"" player if you want to play DivX files!! They stutter terribly! I had to replace this unit with a Pioneer 400V to get DivX files to play good."
3,Problems with HDMI,"The video quality is great. Plays anything you throw at it. DivX/xVid/JPEG from USB is a big thumbs up. The problem I ran into was when I hooked up the player with the HDMI cable. The movie would freeze in the middle while playing. Cannot skip/stop/poweroff. Also, the JPEG shows up in B/W when connected through HDMI. You have to literally yank the power cord from the outlet and power it back on to get it to work again. I restored the RCA cable and the unit started working again.Not giving up yet. Plan to call Philips to see if they've a firmware upgrade on the way."
4,Can't beat this HDTV bargain!,"I paid $60.00 for this player and it does a great job of upscaling my DVDs.....what a great bargain....the increased resolution and contrast and color richness is amazing...of course the higher quality the DVD transfer the better the upscaling, but if you mainly watch new releases you're pretty much guaranteed a great upscaled picture....upscaling DVD players are great and this one is terrific....esp. when you consider the ""pocket change"" price!"
1,gave up after 6 month,"I bought this one at walmart for only 44$ i believe, it is a good player but it is slow to the commands from the remote. plays all DVD's but yesterday after 6 month of owning it, it just gave up, it does not load DVD's anymore, when i turn it off the ""off"" will stay on the menu screen, but it does not turn off all the way... do not buy this"
2,Defective by design?,"This player really improves the DVD playback quality on HDTVs when compared to standard def players. However I had to return it after trying to play a couple of commercial DVD discs. With every disc I tried, the player froze during the playback at different times through out the movie. It ceased to respond to the buttons on the remote and player. I had to plug the power cord out to reset the player.The player had the latest firmware -with an ""improved DVD playback"" feature in the firmware log- and trying those discs on my PS3 without any problems left me no choice but to think that this player was defective.Maybe it is the hardware itself or the upscaling feature is freezing it. It could even be an HDMI connection issue. There's a possibility that it might be fixed by a firmware update but right now it does not really feel like a solid and a stable dvd player."
1,My experience...,"After getting my 1080p LCD tv I wanted an upconvert DVD player. So I ordered this product (I've always had good luck with Phillips products), but I had my first bad experience.When I would try to upconvert I kept getting a onscreen message from the DVD player saying that my TV wasn't compatible, but after double checking the specs with my TV and this DVD player, they should have been compatible. After hours of frustration, I returned this unit. I'm not sure if I got a bad unit, or if there is a compatibility problem with other LCD TVs. Good luck."
1,Does not work,"I received this DVD player with no noticeable damage to the box. I opened it, put in a DVD and immediately noticed a scratching sound. The DVD player will not play any of my DVD's unless I take off the top cover. The DVD will rub against the top not allowing it to gain enough speed to read the DVD. I'm very disappointed considering the DVD player looks to be undamaged what so ever...definitely a manufacturing flaw."
3,it could be better,"1. The user interface sucks!2. It does not support multisession CDs or DVDs that you burn on PCs. It has to be burned SingleSession and finalized, i.e. you cannot add (pics or mp3s) to your CD later on.3. Did I mention the user interface really sucks?Never again I woul dbuy a Philips DVD player. They shoud stick to their electric shaver only!"
4,Works as described,"Bought this DVD player when I upgraded to aSamsung LN46A550 46-inch 1080p LCD HDTVTV. I played a few older DVDs on it and it didn't look that great with upscaling, but those DVDs are OLD. Will post follow up reviews when I can locate DVDs that are more recent. I am not ready to spend that much on Blue Rays set and those 30.00 a piece shows."
4,Recommended,This is an excellent product.Would highly recommend it.Philips DVP5982 1080p Upscaling DVD PlayerVery Good.
2,"TO ME, NOT WORTH THE INCREASED COST","This DVD player is fine, but I do not see much difference between my ""regular"" DVD player and this ""upscaling"" DVD player. I don't personally think the ""upscaling"" is worth the additional cost."
4,$50 special,FYI: It will play .wmv. It will not play dts-CD as my 3 year old Panasonic's will. .flv would really be something. S-video out is missed. Still it saves hours dubbing video from the computer editor to the TV/DVRs in another room.
4,Great but with limitations,The device is functionally very good. The reason I tried this is that it had DIVx compatibility. I can put six 700MB movies in AVI format on one DVD and display them perfectly. The limitation is in the lame remote. It is difficult to use in the DIVx mode and the titles must be very short. I have yet to find a way to stop the current movie and view another on the list. It seems like you have to turn off the machine. If they would change the remote it would be a 5-star product.
5,excellent picture and superior sound,"I have 3 of these dvd players. The first one that I bought I hooked up to my new Sony TV. Excellent picture. Then the CD player that I have in my stereo system went on the fritz. Now I am a classical music listener and am very serious about sound quality. A really good replacement for my old cd player would cost me about $300, and I really didn't want to spend that if I didn't have to. I hooked up the DVP5982 and was pleasantly surprised to find that it had real audiophile sound quality. So I bought one for my stereo. Then I decided to get one for the bedroom TV. There are 2 very minor negatives to this player: 1) the drawer takes about 5 seconds to open and, 2) the drawer is very shallow and you have to be sure the disc is properly centered before closing the drawer. As I said these are minor shortcomings and I would definitely give the DVP5982 five stars."
2,Failed in a year,"This player worked fine in my home theater system for over a year, then the sound through the HDMI port stopped. It always had the annoying habit of turning off the digital sound now and then (never figured out why/when it would happen), but now there is no sound period. No changes to the rest of the system, checked the cable, tv, receiver port. No sound. Nothing in the menu will fix it. It's now doing occasional duty in a spare bedroom using the composite outputs. Replaced with new Sony product."
2,No Disk Error,"This one started dying after 1 year. After about an hour of continuous play, the DVD freezes up. Doesn't play anything after that until the unit cools down. Now, it doesn't load any DVD that was partially played on it before, since it tries to load from the previously stopped point and cannot do it. I bought another DVD player (Samsung) at the same time I purchased this one and have many problems with that one as well. Is there any reliable DVD player out there???Krish"
5,Philips DVP5982 1080p,"Works great with my JVC Hi-def TV. Picture improvement over regular DVD player is slight but noticeable. Simple to use, great price. I am considering buying another one for another TV."
2,Sound problems haunt this unit,"I bought this unit from Best Buy in the first week of November and by the first week of December I had great picture, but no sound. I brought it back and the store exchanged it for a new unit, since the problem occured within 30 days. The second unit did fine until mid April, and again the same problem occured. Being past 30 days, the solution has become a lot more complicated. And there is truth to the saying: ""you get what you pay for!""I'm shopping for another unit...."
4,Good Player for a BUCK!!!,"Had it for a month and It Works and Looks Great. Did not have a problem of viewing regular DVDs in a full 1080i resolution... Although, never was able to up-convert to full 1080p. All in All, nice upgrade from my regular DVD-player."
2,Disappointing so far,"As many have, I bought this DVD player to hold me over until I want to invest in a high definition DVD system. Being that I have a 1080p TV it was important to me to have an upscaling 1080p player. Unfortunately, I am not impressed by the upscaling with little to no difference between the different modes: 480, 720, 1080. I have only watched three movies so far, I will update if necessary."
4,It works!,I wouldn't mind this in a 3-5 dvd holder but it plays everything it said it would. A little slow to load but not that bad. It is worth the money.
4,Good DVD Player for the Price,"I have only had the DVD about a month, but it seems to play just fine. The price was good and it wasn't too difficult to set up. The directions are a hoot if not too informative, but the setup is fairly intuitive. If you use an HDMI cable connection(not included), you have to remember to enable the audio for HDMI specifically or you don't get any sound. I do like the fact that the remote control is very basic - my last DVD had a remote with more keys than I ever managed to figure out before the DVD quit working. The picture quality is very good and you can open the disc drawer with the remote - a very nice feature. All in all, I think I received good value for the price. It just remains to be seen how long the player actually lasts."
4,Works well !!,"This product definitely works as expected, reason I got this product mainly was to play songs/movies from my external drive and it does that well.DVD player - upscales resolution. Loading of disc takes a while - but is bearable - so no complaints. Remote does not have eject button - I still have to fool around with it to find quirks and goodies.Hope this helps !!!"
2,"DVD -R Media Warning, Upconversion?","I purchased this DVD player to hook up to a new 37"" HDTV. I used the up-conversion feature but I didn't see a difference compared to my 7 year old DVD player (which I also hooked up to the HDTV) which was the whole reason I bought this in the first place.The player will not read any DVD-R's that was burned on cheap DVD-R media (I get an ""Unknown"" error). I upgraded the firmware, no difference. Why my 7 year old Apex DVD player and my super-cheap Dynex portable DVD players can still read the DVD-R's but this player cannot is beyond me. It does read better quality DVD-R media (Sony for example).Finally, the DVD tray does feel cheap and the tray does not eject all the way.I figured I would see a marked improvement buying a better brand name up-converting DVD player compared to my old player but my old player works just as fine (or actually better considering my DVD-R collection is useless with the new player)."
3,This will resume play from the point at which DVD was removed.,"Depends on the actual DVD features, this has a feature that if you takeout a DVD before the end of the movie and watch other DVD's, then put the a previous watched DVD back in, it will remember the place it stopped and restart from that place. Just like a VCR tape. I really don't like the remote, it is really cheap and inconsistent action. I wish it was more like a Sony player and remote."
2,"Slow, Finicky, and Frustrating","With all the options out there for playing a DVD, I would avoid this player. I have hated it since the day we got it. The primary problem is that it boots up painfully slowly, and then takes forever to recognize and play the inserted disc. There is usually about five minutes that elapses from the time we decide to watch a movie to the time it is up on the screen. Furthermore, this thing gets hung up on any DVD that has the slightest flaw, scratch, smudge, or speck on it. With standard Netflix roadwear, we usually have to remove the disc two or three times and restart the movie. The player is also really loud."
2,Terrible quality,Broken in half year and come back one year later. Sometime works sometime not. Might be mechanical problem.
4,Muy Buen Equipo,"Muy Buen Equipo, me permite ver todos los formatos que bajo de internet ademas de los DVD convencionales. Lo recomiendo.La unica contra es que un poco lento para algunas funciones."
2,usb capability is poor,I got this on a suggestion for a DVD player that supports many formats and includes USB support to play my digital media. I found that the usb support is slow crap and it stutters on active scenes. The same avi file recorded on a DVD would play fine but je je je jerk from the usb drive. Pretty much regret the purchase.
4,"Great, If it's working","Simply put,this is a great product for the money. It works greta for me, if it's workign at all.The upscaling portion of it is strange. When i put in, Like Jurassic Park, and the menu comes up. I go to the setup and go to 1080p and set it for that HD viewing, but the screen itself i can't see much difference, so if it's working it looks great. I find with HD that messing with your TV is more important than the upscaling because the color and brightness and contrast are the magic of HD..Make sure your TV looks good first.1 slip up... For soem reason The HDMI portion of the DVD player only with show HD conenction in my HDMI 1 input. My other 2 HDMI inputs don't work with the DVD Player.. So my digital cable i plug to HDMI 2 and i Have the DVD player in HDMI 1.. Its not the TV cause i've tried the player on 3 different HD models.good stuff"
4,Reviewing the Philips DVP5982 1080p Upscaling DVD Player,"I purchased the DVP5982 to view .avi files. So far, of the several hundred .avi-formatted files accessed, the Player has had only one occurrence where an .ave file could not be played (due to an unrecognized codex). The HDMI cable interface works well (cable not supplied), and once the unit is initialized, the output is crystal clear with no video noise noted for any of its formats. I have not tried the 'Upscaling' feature yet."
4,"Great player, Bad remote ontrol","This player works great. So far there are no problems with it. It also plays movies that i was unable to play on a different dvd player. The only problem i have with this player is the remote control. I mean it looks and feels cheap. But really it doesnt work that great when you press it. I have to press play a few times before it actually goes on while another time there are no probems. But when you do get the movie on, the quality of the movie is great."
4,awesome awesome,"i'd recommend this product to anyone and everyone.works as a region-free dvd player and plays divx files from cd/dvd/usb.i plug in my external hard drive to the usb and it basically is converted into my media server.plays mp3's and movies that are on the external usb hard drive.i believe it will only recognize FAT32 format, for external hard drives.i'm not sure about the format issue for usb key/memory sticks.you will not be unhappy with this product.however, i have to give it four stars instead of five because of the remote functionality.either the IR receiver is not sensitive enough or the remote IR transmitter is not strong enough.unless you point right at the player with the remote, its hard to get responsiveness.also the remote buttons are too hard to push.for $40 you can't go wrong with this.get it now!"
4,"good product for the price, but problems with open box","This is a good product for the price. The upscaled picture quality is definitely not as good as HD but it still looks good. This is a good product to use until you feel like buying a blu-ray.When it arrived in the mail, I was upset to see that the ""new"" dvd player had clearly been used: the remote was missing and there was still a dvd in the tray. In all fairness, Amazon's customer service was good: I returned the used one and had a new one within a few days. It was a hassle, but overall I'd buy from Amazon again."
5,Best upconverter in the market!,"After reading all the raving reviews I decided to get 1 of these from Amazon and 1 from the phillips outlet (refurbished). Both of these worked amazingly once I update the firmware from the website. They upconvert to 1080p perfectly and you really can see the different on a 46"" sharp lcd. The only problem I encountered was when using HDMI I had no sound at first. On the Sharp lcd I had to unplug the composite audio then it worked."
4,Pretty Good,"The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it is so SLOOOOW in opening up the tray, why that is, I have no idea.But the quality of the movies on the TV screen are considerably better than a regular DVD player, I have others that I can compare them with.About 98% of all the DVD's I play in this machine is ones I have burned myself and so far have only had one that it will not play correctly. Have another Phillips player that the same DVD would not play in, but the computer plays it perfectly, go figure.But if you don't mind being more than normal patient in waiting to load the player, then this one so far for me has been very good. I've had it for nearly a year now and no problems of any kind."
4,Great DVD Player,"I have two of the Phillips 5982 DVD upscaling players. It is anexcellent unit. The problem is that the upscale feature only worksover an HDMI connection. I tried to make it work over componentcables because the owners manual does not mention that it requiresHDMI, and wound up calling Phillips ""Help"" line. They couldn't help.I finally rearranged ports on my TV (I had only one HDMI port) andthe unit worked. It does a fine job of upscaling. My other TV had two HDMIports so there was no problem."
5,Plays everything,Excellent player. Handles videos encoded in Xvid perfectly. Sound matches after fast forwarding/rewinding on AVI files (on the DVP-642 it didn't). Also in setup you can adjust the sound to move slightly ahead or back to match your system perfectly. DVDimages on a flash drive also play fine.
3,Freezes,"Very sharp and clean picture (compared to Toshiba SD-5000) even on a 100"" projection screen. Upconverter is better than the one built into Mitsubishi HD1000U projector. Plays DivX like a charm including those Ultra DivX files with built-in bmp subtitles. Would definitely be a keeper, if it didn't pause, choke, freeze on certain titles like ""Terminator 2"" and ""Cars"".Another thing that annoyed me all the time was the player trying to route 5.1 raw audio through HDMI if the HDMI cable was plugged. In my setup HDMI cable was going to projector alone and audio receiver was being fed via coax. Philips for whatever reason by default was trying to send 5.1 audio to HDMI, and coax was getting only PCM. This could easily be fixed via player's menu, but after disconnecting and reconnecting the power, it was going back to this strange behavior."
4,Decent 1080p Upconvert DVD player,"It works flawlessly since I've had it, but the only problem that I have is that the DVD tray is not sturdy like other DVD players that I have had. If you push it in slightly hard it will break it easily. Beside that problem, this is a great 1080p upconvert with affordable price."
3,"Handles many video formats, but crappy remote and user interface!","I purchased this unit b/c I wanted something that would play NTSC and PAL DVDs, as well as .avi files. The USB port is a cool feature as well. The user interface, however, leaves a lot to be desired. Whether directly pressing buttons on the unit (e.g. to open the disc tray) or via the remote, the unit is slow to react and several button presses are sometimes necessary. This also mays it frustrating to do simple pauses, rewinds, return to menu, etc. I would not purchase this unit again. I would look for one which similarly handled a large range of video formats, but with a MUCH sleeker user interface. It's like they created a great unit, then dropped the ball on the packaging."
4,Good DVD Player,"Have several, needed multi format. Works extremely well. Only negative is lack of ""time remaining"" when DVD is playing in the Display/Info. It will be nice to see all 3 times on the same page: Time Elapsed, Time Remaining, and Total Time. Also if support for HD USB devices can be provided it would make it a terrific device. Hope these upgrdes get implemented in a firmware update."
4,Good Product!,"Good product. The unit itself is very sleek and very very wide...The remote is flimsy and cheaply made, but works well. The menu screen looks like something from the '80s, but again, it works. I used this along with my Sandisk 4gb Titanium. Please note that this unit 5982 is NOT compatible with the Sandisk 4gb w/ U3 software. To make it work, you must unistall U3 which comes preloaded in the flash drive and format the drive with fat32.AFter the uninstall, it worked nicely."
5,Amazing DivX player,"I took a risk, when I decided to go for this player, but was not sure if it can read all the Xvid and DivX files with AC3 plugin, I was prepared to return it within a month if it did not come, but was amazed to see how it worked. I was able to play all my DivX movies and normal DVD's upscaled.For sanity purpose I ran a check for the same DivX movie via S-VGA (Laptop) and HDMI (DVD Player) up scaled, and the results were quite different. The colours were brighter and the movie scaled better to fit 16:9. A must recommendation for any with lot of DivX movies.Now only if I can find a hack to stream over the USB port (is it an overkill!) It would be amazing!Update: I got a 1TB HDD connected to the player, with all my photo and video collection and can view them anytime I want, without having to keep changing dvds or small 2G flash drives. :)"
4,Great product @ Great Price & Great features,"Philips as always makes great and rock solid products which last long and great innovative features. The same applies to this product.I have hooked it up to my new Samsung LN52A550 and viewing even normal DVDs on this looks stunning.DivX looks like you are running DVD.USB is great feature, you can use it to play DivX movies or regular CD, it doesnot play DVD dump. Also plays MP3 from USB.Remote is bit lower standard as looks and feel cheap and bit tricky to work with from wide angles also some controls are not straight forward and you will have to read manual to know all remote features.Over all a great buy."
1,Doesn't work right from the box,The only disk I was able to play was cleaning disk.All others froze.I checked firmware was the latest one.I checked troubleshooting section and findinteresting facts:1. Player likes only clean and ideal disks.2. It plays Divx only if it encoded as Home Theaterand used codec 5.x3. Does not play Divx from external USB HD.4. If disk froze plug player off and back onbecause there is no power button.On positive site I can note it was setwith region code 0.Anyway I requested RMA and do not recommend it.
3,Not playing movies through USB,"The only concerns I had with the player is that the picture was at first skewed, so I had to fine tune the picture. I am missing also that the USB connection does not allow playing movies."
4,Unit works great; Wish it had more audio features,"The DVD player works as it should, and the picture looks great. No complaints there. It would earn 5 stars except for the lack of ability to generate 5.1 sound with a direct connection to my sound system. I don't know if I can get it out of the TV set with a HDMI connection."
4,Great Media Device,"I bought the Philips DVP6082 primarily to make use of the USB connection on it. I plugged a big hard drive into the USB port loaded with about 500 sitcom episodes and around 20 movies. The content is a mixture of DVD rips, downloaded video, and things I've recorded off the air using the TV tuner card in my PC. I have yet to find any video format the device can't play. It's an inexpensive way to set up a media server and the output looks pretty good.The DVD upconversion looks good too, and I haven't had any problems with it. I recommend this device."
1,Philips Short Lived DVD,We have had this DVD player for about 6 months. It no longer turns on or functions in any way. We consider this an unreliable piece of hardware and at this time I strongly recommend against anyone else buying it.
5,"great value, great performance",HDMI output and great upconversion/upscaling will delay my BluRay DVD player purchase for several years. very crisp viewing of current cheap DVDs on my 37 inch TV.
3,Limited functions,"This DVD player plays videos well. My issue is that there is not a separate skip forward and search forward button. In order to search forward (or backwards), one needs to hold down the skip forward button. This doesn't always happen and sometimes when i try to search forward a little bit the disk skips forward to the next scene. Would it be so hard to have the additional button? Even when I use the universal remote it still has this problem."
2,Relatively Cheap Quality DVD Player,"Recently purchased this DVD player (region free) from an Amazon seller and discovered it is actually quite a cheap unit. Crappy little remote that has the look and feel of something that will get busted if one looks at it sideways. The player itself is not much better in terms of ruggedness and workmanship. As soon as I connected the HDMI cable, I was greeted to a screen that constantly went from on to blank to on again. Tried two other HDMI cables, but the problem persisted. Had to return it to the seller, who fortunately will accept returns. Personally, I'd look to spend a little more and acquire a better model. This unit has the appearance of one that you might be unlucky enough to receive at a $20 gift exchange at Christmas. Steer clear."
1,Too much technology!,I was led to believe that the upscaling feature would produce a better picture but the extreme pixelation when a scene changed from light to dark made watching movies almost unbearable.I just purchased a new Sony progressive scan dvd player and the Phillips will go into the closet to collect dust.
2,A cheaply made dvd player,I will only give it 2 stars. The dvd player has issues.Cons:1. dvd gets stuck sometimes. Only way to recover is to power cycle.2. DVD player makes strange noises when in idle.3. The remote feels like a toy.4. Even with the hdmi the picture quality is so so.
1,Do Not Buy!,This product is horrible. It is described as litter with crystals. It is more like concrete dust. I should have known not to purchase this because of the low price.
2,It might be good... but I returned it.,"I bought it after reading enormous recommendations on M-Audio brand everywhere. Unfortunately I ended up returning it, because it's...terrible.Connecting to my new Dell desktop and senn HD-280 headphone, the sound distorts as soon as the volume is turned half way up.Then I tried my laptop, same problem plus a static-like sound becomes audible after about a minute. Nothing can stop it unless powering down the laptop. Restart, works for one minute, then the same thing happens again.Now I wonder where did all those wonderful comments on M-Audio come from."
2,Goddess Kali,I bought this cd thinking it had meditation techniques on it. It has 3 tracks explaining and the last approx. 2 minutes of each track it has music and he just says for example (don't want to tell too much detail and ruin it) find the silence within the music. I was disappointed. I thought it was the technique on how to achieve these states of mind. It was like an introduction to these ideas for a beginner who has never meditated.
5,Love your belly!,"Great book! Easy to follow, real advice ... a great step towards healing the warped image we have of our bodies."
4,A lot easier than a pump.,"If you're looking to save weight, this little guy can't be beat. It imparts a bit of a chlorine taste to the water (depending on how strong you make the solution), but it's a lot better than iodine. MSR includes some chlorine testing strips, which seem like a bit of a hassle, but you can forego them (and shorten battery life) by overtreating the water. Interestingly, this device was developed for the US Military, and has been shown to neutralize a lot of biological agents, including VX nerve gas. I'd give it five stars, but the chlorine test and the recommended test strips affected my rating."
4,A Clear and Elegant Performance,"Pletnev's debut recital at Carnegie Hall was excellent. His dynamics and phrasing in the Bach. The Beethoven was indentified with and introspective. The four scherzos sound like different pieces than one is used to hearing. Pletnev brings out many interesting details and nuances in them. Melodic lines that one would not know existed come through beautifully and not without meaning. The encore CD is a fantastic bonus. The Rachmaninov is passionate and rich. The Scarlatti is clean as a whistle and elegant. The virtuosic etude by Moszkowski was so sensitive and elegant; one can even hear the audience's enjoyment before the last rolled chord is finished. The Balakirev is what really makes this bonus CD worth it, though. Pletnev captures the spirit of the Orient and with every variation takes on a different character. The ending had the audience in a rage!! BUY THIS CD!"
5,Breathtaking!,"This is an amazing performance, especially as it was recorded live and not reworked in a studio. Pletnev is one of this generation's greatest pianists. He manages to find nuances in the music that make these works fresh, particularly the four Chopin Scherzi that are part of every concert pianist's repertoire. The bonus CD is especially fine as it shows how Pletnev is capable of playing just about any style of music. As if the rest of the program wasn't virtuosic enough, Pletnev caps off the concert with the fiendishly difficult Islamey as one of his encores."
5,Shaun Escoffery -- remixed by the cream of the crop!,"New versions of some of the best tracks by cosmic soul singer Shaun Escoffery -- remixed by the cream of the crop of the current underground! An all-global lineup worked on the tracks on the set -- including Jazzanova, Peter Kruder, DJ Spinna, Ticklah, DJ Cam, Mark Mac, Koop, and Mark De Clive-Lowe -- leading us to wonder where they found such a big bag of money to put together the album! Money aside, though, the album's a heck of a record -- as Shaun's original tunes are wonderfully abstract and open-minded, leaving lots of angles for other folks to come in and change things up. The results are great -- taking the tunes into even more cosmic territory than the originals -- and titles include versions of ""Let It Go"", ""Into The Blue"", ""Breaking Away"", ""Conversations Of The Heart"", ""Space Rider"", ""Days Like This"", and ""Give Everything"". (Reviewed at http://www.dustygroove.com/)"
1,Doesn't work..not even a little,"I needed a bleaching cream but was too afraid to get one because most of them contain hydroquinone which is rumored to cause skin cancer. I was hopeful to find this product from Olay as I'm a loyal Olay girl. I used this on a dark spot on my cheek. The ad promised a change in 2 weeks maximum. I used it religiously twice a day for 2 months, applying the cream only to the dark spot. I've yet to see any difference on my skin, neither lighter nor darker.. nothing. Save your money, look elsewhere. As the previous poster mentioned, it's good as a backup moisturizer as it's not too oily."
4,OLAY Regenerist - Targeted Tone Enhancer,"I did not have the same results or lack there of from this product as these other women had. I have brown patches on the sides of my face and on my forehead and although I do not apply this on a regular basis it has pretty much diminished these brown patches from my face to give me a more even tone to my skin. I am very pleased with this and will buy more as soon as i am finished with the tube i have now. It does work well as a good moisturizer as well, but i don't really use it for that."
1,Saw No Change - Zero - Absolutely None!,"I am a HUGE fan of Olay products and use their foaming face wash, moisturizers (including the Regenerist Continuous Night Recovery is a great product)... so I was really dissapointed to spend $16+ on this product and then see no change. I am in my 30's, have fair/medium shade combination skin. I tried using it on various types of spots from a beauty mark to a break-out spot that was healing. I tried using it a couple of times a day, at first blending it in and then even leaving a dollop on the marks while I slept (not blending it into my skin). I tried it for several weeks. No results. This product did nothing for me. I would not recommend it. I would have given it zero start, but Amazon does not allow it.Avon has a product out that touts similar claims to Olay's product. I have not tried it yet but would suggest you see if you can try a sample of that from an Avon rep. instead."
1,"Win some, lose some",I simply love most all of Olay products..especially the Regenerist line... until I bought the Tone Enhancer. It did nothing for my face. Not one thing stated on the tube happened to my skin. I guess I will use it as a moisturizer until it's gone.
4,Great Product,This product actually does what it claims.It is irritating if you get it to close to your eyes.
3,Olay product works ok.,This tone enhancer doesn't work as well as expected. Have used for months without any difference that I can tell. Will give it a little more time.
1,the only thing I got out of this was a rash,"If I could, I would give it zero stars. Applied it every day to my face for a month and my brown spots are still there. Tried it a second time and got a red rash which looked like a sunburn for a week. What an expensive and painful waste of money. I'll go and visit a dermatologist instead..."
1,If it's not food don't eat it,"This book is way to organic and earthy. I believe it eating healthy and smart, but this book goes way beyond reasonable measures."
5,"Sturdy, spacious binder","I love the Avery extra-wide binders for all my business & home projects, because I can use insertable tabbed index dividers (meaning, I can insert an 8-1/2 x 11 sheet of paper) and the extra width of the binder protects those tabs, which would otherwise stick out beyond the edges of a regular binder. One of my Avery extra-wide binders gets nearly daily use, and after 9 years it finally split. I was so impressed with how long it lasted & what a great workhorse it was for me, I didn't hesitate to replace it with another Avery extra-wide. When this one arrived last month, I discovered they improved the design of the binder mechanism, so it's even easier to open & close. Very pleased."
2,yuk,i found these gloves to be poorly made. Maybe it is because i was comparing them to the Coach gloves i had years ago. I was not impressed.
4,got this Replacement because I wore out my first copy.,"I love this book as it is a simple easy to understand and easy to follow book that is lean and clean consise without all the jargon and terminology mucking up the t6he self help book. If U'r honest and really examine yourself You'll probably get at least thirty good years with your spouse too. The only thing it couldn't help with was the "" 'till death do you part thing!"" If my partner had not died we'd still be going strong. I owe alot to this book. It helped me be an adult in my relationship and communicate without the games and histrionics. to be clear genuine and nonjudemental to engage with genuine affection and compassion and empathy and be non critical and love unconditionally. This is a must have book."
3,Apt cover for textbook,"This book is full of useful information but it is pretty dry reading. Page after page of black and white text. No colors except black, white, and gray. A few gray and white charts to break up the monotony. No margin definitions, related articles or info, or other colors used in the book. I found that I had to stop and rest my eyes when I had a long reading assignment because the words would begin to blur after a while. (I do not have this problem with my other textbooks.)"
1,Race & Ethic Relations,"I am very glad you contact me. I will love to make a review,as soon you send me the book, or arrive. TodaY IS Feb.12 and I have not received the book, its already a Month I BROUGHT from u. Can you tell me how much longer, I am very behind at that class. Sincerely, this is the first time had happen this situation when I buy books from you all the time. Please, answer me. Since, this time the book has not availbility to track it.thanks."
4,Not a bad meal,"I liked the beef stroganoff. I had it after a long hike in the mountains and found it tasty and satisfying. There was enough in the pouch that I saved some for the morning. I don't eat a lot of these meals, and I wasn't expecting much more than something to get into my stomach. It was tasty. It seemed built for the REI spork I was stupid enough to buy. I'll buy the stroganoff again, but I pitched the spork. I'll stick to chop sticks and a regular spoon."
4,Over Priced,"These are great, just 2 cups of boiling water and wait 9 minutes and you get a really tasty meal that fills you up-very hearty. The only problem is this is $6.55 at WalMart, so why buy here?"
4,delicious,This packet of food was very good. Easy to prepare. Good portion size. I am putting together my 3-month emergency supply so I'm shopping around. Because of the price I have to determine if I leave this brand out or use it merely as a change in routine item.
1,Beef Stroganoff six pouch scam,"Can you imagine going to a retail store and seeing the person ahead of you on line asking for one pouch and being charged $7. They you ask to purchase the six pouch version, are handed one pouch and are charged $30.I have always been happy with the merchandise I have ordered combining price, quality and ease of delivery. I have ordered thousands of dollars in merchandize from many different product categories in the last several years.My pleasant experience ended with this order. I ordered six pouches of beef stroganoff and only one was delivered and I was charged for six.What a shame. I processed a request for a refund, UPS never showed to pick up the package."
2,Not a good book for early repo classes,"The book feels like a pervy old man wrote it. I had to buy the book for a class and it is useless before lecture. After lecture some of it makes sense, but it even makes references to things ""you should have learned in previous reproduction classes"" so it was in no way written for someone with little background in the subject. Also, the book I ordered was describe as, ""in good condition"" -_- I would barely say it is acceptable. I had to duct tape the spine and there was writing and highlighting all over it."
4,Caught Up,"Caught In The Mixwas a really good book. I enjoyed it a lot. Being in love is no punk lol. You have to really know what your getting yourself into. Caught Up In the Mix is about your typical relationship that deals with secrets, lies, long distance relationship and career struggles. Candice Dow did a wonderful job with this book, and I'm looking forward to reading more of her work in the future.TangerineReader's Paradise Book Club"
5,You will be Caught in the Mix!,"Caught in the Mix is awesome. The dynamics in the various storylines and characters adds to the depth of the novel. I journeyed throughout Clark and Devin's tangled yet intriguing relationship and yearned for more every time I flipped the page. Some of the characters will be loved and some will be hated with a passion. But, when the novel is over, you will find yourself questioning why certain storylines veered in the directions that they did and then wondering where their tales will lead us in the future. I look forward to my next installment in my Candice Dow Collection. Kudos Candice on your first novel! It is definitely a must read!"
5,Excellent Read,"Caught In The Mix is an excellent read. I couldn't put it down because I was dying to know what was going to happen with Clark and Devin. This is definitely a novel that I would recommend. Candice, I'm proud of you girl! From Western, to UMES, to JHU, and now a novelist. Keep doing the damn thing!"
4,"I got ""Caught Up In the Mix""",Candice wrote an incredible debut novel! When can we get a sequel??? We read this book as our book club selection for the month of July. I must say that I really enjoyed this book. Caught Up In the Mix... had me literally Caught Up... Keep up the good work Candice!!! I look forward to your next piece of work.
5,LOVE CAN REALLY HURT,"I totally enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end. I am wondering if a sequel will follow this....not too sure if everything is said and done. I had to show support to the author Candice Dow, a fellow alumni of University of Maryland Eastern Shore. The book is easy to read, full of drama and the characters speak out to you. I highly reccommend this book if you enjoy love stories that could really happen in real life. 5 Stars for this book and this is her first book? Excellent. I look forward to more!-Erica"
5,OMG! OMG!,WOW! WOW! I am so over myself with this book. I LOVE LOVE everything about it. I have read it twice! I swear this book has to be living my life because it hit so close to home! Candice Dow you are officially on my book list. Keep giving it to us Candice Dow!
3,A Good Start,"I actually read this book after having read another book by Ms. Dow (Hire Love) and can definiately say that her writing improves. However, I don't want to take away from this work. It was written in a style that makes you relate to the players to the point that you get angry with them, feel their disappointment and hurt. I am glad she didn't fall into the trap of having the book end the way everyone expects it should. I like Ms. Dow's style of writing especially in this day and age when authors writing about African-Americans seem to be limited to sex, drugs and violence."
5,College Love,"I read ""Caught in the Mix"" in two days. From the moment I opened the book I was drawn to the young characters. It made me think back to my college years and my first love. I couldn't put it down until I knew the destination of young Clark and Devin. Grab a copy of ""Caught in the Mix"" and take a journey into the lives of two college students in love."
5,Brilliant !,"This disc is simply amazing. It's the closest you can get aside from seeing a live performance. Willy is the only musician I enjoy better when he is performing by himself instead of with his band. I've seen him about five or six times and I just I still can't believe what a talent he is. This is the best disc I've bought in five or six years hands down. I liked it so much, I bought another three for gifts for friends and family. Willy is the total package: Soulful voice, skilled writer, amazing guitar player, brilliant showmanship, and a pretty down to earth guy. A lot of his other studio work, although decent, don't seem to capture all of his talent. This disc gets closer to the real thing. I hope he makes another ten live cds."
4,Quick peek,"Yoriko to me shares a smiliar sound as to more famous groups like Garnet Crow and the like. If you do come into this album because of Break The Coocon, you'll be surprised by the fact that the particular track is the odd one out--most of them are fairly slow and they're not very intense. I'd still recommend it just because it's a good overview."
4,Casio CTK710 61 Key Electronic Keyboard with USB,Casio CTK710 61 Key Electronic Keyboard with USBI bought this as I graudation gift for my son who is intrested in learning to play the keyboard and believe me he has in one week he learned how to play the theme for alicia keys No One song on the key board. So if you want to get this for anyone as a starter keyboard player this is the one to get for them. Great gift idea.........
2,Doesn't seem practical,I didn't like this because it doesn't appear to be very practical or realistic. The video quality is also poor do to the fact it is a much older video.
4,Love the use of Greek myth,I just love these Dark Hunter books. I like how she uses greek myth and gives the reader more than the boring romance novels.
5,Great mix of humor and Sexual tension!,"I loved this book, it was one of my first from Sherrilyn Kenyon, and it won't be the last! I love the chemistry between the characters and the sexual tension. This was a great read! I love the mix of greek mythology and vampires. I recommend this book to all paranormal romance fans. Actually, I'd recommend it to just about anyone! Also check out Fantasy Lover, it was full of the same humor and even more sex!"
2,Very disappointed,"What struck me most about this book was the low reading level. I would imagine that if I plugged some of the dialogue into Word it could tell me that the book was written on about a third grade level. All simple sentences, no deep or engaging description. Although I found myself engrossed in the storyline, which was very creative, the writing was so off-putting that it was hard to get past. I got this book from the library and it also has part two of the series, but I am not going to read it. I struggled to get through Night Pleasures, and certainly don't crave more. I would highly recommend something by Gena Showalter or Kresley Cole instead; they write on a noticeably higher level than this book was written yet have similar storylines for those interested in paranormal romance."
4,LOVE IT!!! WHO WOULDN'T,"I LOVE SHERRILYN KENYON, AND LOVED THIS STORY. LIKE THE OTHERS, THIS HAS A GREAT STORY LINE AND GREAT CHARACTERS. I HAVENT READ ONE OF THESE BOOKS THAT I DIDN'T HAVE A HARD TIME PUTTING DOWN. GREAT!!! I CANT WAIT FOR FUTURE BOOKS FROM HER TO HIT THE BOOKSHELVES!"
1,tooo long!,this book way toooo long i borrowed someone elses because i had been done book one!! it took a month for the book to arrive! so O now ownn the book but I had already moved on to book three at that point!! NEVER NEVER AGAIN!!! I will pay the full price at the book store!
5,Night Pleasutes,Sherrilyn Kenyon is GREAT at writing this type of novel. She must have great experience. Keep it up. They are fantastic.
5,Exciting start to a stellar new series,"Sherrilyn Kenyon does it again - writing a wonderful fantasy romance. Her ""-Hunter"" series promises to be an exciting one. She fully develops the mythology surrounding her characters and slyly introduces several new players, which the reader immediately becomes attached to and wants to know more about.As a series long fan of both Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, I appreciate the detail that Kenyon shows in describing the strict code and rules that the -Hunters will abide by.This book is exciting, sensual and detailed. I highly recommend it as a great read!"
2,Disappointed,"This is the first book by Sherrilyn Kenyon I've read, and will most likely be the last. I thought the underlying story was interesting and enjoyed parts of the book very much, but it seemed like every other paragraph was a sex scene. It ruined it for me. Though her sex scenes were well written, if I'd wanted to read a trashy romance, I wouldn't be looking in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. It just wasn't what I had expected."
3,"The book is hot, but not much else...","This book is really sexy. The author excels at writing really good sex scenes. Other than that, there is not much else holding this book together. Typical of this author, the hero has a horrendous past that makes him an emotional cripple. I think you can see where the plot is going from that. The heroine will rescue him and make him whole. There is no journey to love in this book, the characters simply love each other. The plot is more focused on action. I enjoyed reading it, but will not read other books in the series, as the book lacked the emotional poignancy that I look for. As a further note, the author has incredible imagination (as displayed in most of her works), but I wish she could get beyone portraying her heroes with terrible backgrounds. She needs to use her imagination a bit more instead of recycling her old plots."
4,So good!,"I really love this book. Sherrilyn Kenyon is one of my favorite paranormal romance novelist. She really rocks. I love the wise cracks from Nick, however I didn't care for Tabitha or Esmeralda. I just didn't care for these two characters, they were just so annoying in their views on vampires. They could have been kept from the book. But all in all this book was super."
3,"Unfortunately, the only decent book in the series","I hate to admit it, but I thought this book was pretty darn fun. Yes, the dialogue is immature and campy, the hero is tortured and the heroine has a certifiable family, but the sex is steamy and some of the other characters (like Acheron and Nick, the hero's helper) make the story bearable.After a while, Kyrian of Thrace (the hero) grows on you. What can you say to a man who's tall, blond, and has enough muscles for three guys? But if it came down to it, I'd take Acheron any day. And Amanda (the heroine) proves she's made of some strong stuff in the end, so I appreciate her effort.If this review seems a little scattered, it's only because people before me have done a good job summing it up."
3,Mediocre paranormal,"This is a relatively new genre for me - paranormal romance, but I thought I would give it a try after reading Fantasy Lover. This is a continuation of the same theme where the ""gods"" manipulate and punish humans into becoming some type of immortal being to do their bidding. As in the last book, the heroine is a 21st century gal and the hero is an immortal from eons ago - ancient Greek era. I was not expecting this to be a history lesson, but it is really ""light-weight"", even for the genre. The hero and heroine fall in love too quickly and with very little effort. Again, I know this is supposed to be fantasy, but some of the stuff really stretches that to the limit. The weak plot is strung together with several HOT sex scenes. There are some characters in this book that will appear in her later books - I just hope that SK invents a better story for them."
3,good,its a book s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s sssssssssssssssssssss ssssssssssssss ssssssssssss
5,Erotic thriller,"I love all the hunters, Sherilyn gets you so entwined with their lives that you feel like you can relate to the characters. Love it!!"
2,Not as good as Fantasy Lover,"Night Pleasures was a big disappointment to me afterFantasy Lover (Dark-Hunter, Book 1). Fantasy Lover was fresh and funny and sexy. Night Pleasures is clichéd and brings in a confusing range of supernatural beings. In Fantasy Lover, the supernatural beings were Greek gods who punished the male love interest Julian of Macedon. Greek gods get short shrift in fantasy compared to the Celtic mythos, so including them was creative and added interest. The Greek gods are back in Night Pleasures, plus Dark-Hunters (immortal vampire hunters), and the vampires themselves, all milling around in New Orleans. The plot of Night Pleasures parallels that of Fantasy Lover, with practical and single Amanda Devereaux attracted to immortal and cursed Kyrian of Thrace. Will Amanda break the curse and win Kyrian's love?I know Sherrilyn Kenyon's books are hugely popular, so I'm going to try the next one in the series to see if she finds her stride."
5,Love this!!,This book is amazing! A must-read book!!!! I recommend it to everyone. Sherrilyn Kenyon writes stories that draw you in and you don't want to leave!
3,Disappointing but still a fairly good read,This is the first book I read by this author. It didn't ensnare me from the beginning like C Feehan's or K. Cole's books do but I read through to the end. I guess there wasn't enough chemistry for me. I am still going to continue on with the next book in the series. I haven't given up on it yet.
3,Beware of kindle addition,"This is a great book, and so far a really good series. I would give the story 5 starts BUT only gave it 3 because the kindle edition has so many spelling errors in it that its very hard to read and very distracting. Its hard to get into the story with so many errors. Ive always found a few in most kindle edition books but never this bad. It makes me nervous to get the next book."
5,Must love Kyrian,"How could any (Hetero)woman not love a wise cracking, sexy, tortured guy like Kyrian? Not to mention he strictly adheres to the Dark-Hunter code of conduct and, oh yeah, saves us mere mortals on a nightly basis! What a guy! (Sigh)Sherrilyn Kenyon's first Dark-Hunter novel has me itching to read more. Night Pleasures had a great pace and really took me into the story. My only fear is the rest of the series won't live up to this awsome first book."
3,It was good,This book was not a disappointment major or otherwise. I look forward the rest of the series quite eagerly. It has taken a common story and turned it into something quite unique and thrilling. I can't wait till she eventually does Ash's story.
5,one of my favorite characters,The characters in this book are my favorite so far. I have ordered 3 more Dark-Hunter books based on this book. I have become a major fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon series
5,"Move Over, Christine Feehan...","Sherrilyn Kenyon has perfected the paranormal romance novel! This book, the first in the Dark-Hunters series has surpassed her competition by a mile. Her characters sparkle, possessing the depth and complexity of real people (not merely the cookie-cutter romance stand-ins). The back story of Greek mythology and vampire legend is well thought-out, original, and intriguing. She relies on none of the conventional romance novel props...no forced sex and no ridiculous love-hate ping pong. This book is fun, enjoyable, sexy, and interesting. Finally! A great paranormal romance with a solid fictional plot and multi-dimensional characters. If you like Christine Feehan's work, you'll find a new favorite to adore with Ms. Kenyon's Dark-Hunters."
2,Am I missing something?,"I'm a fan of romance, but I just don't get the vampire thing here. Aside from not really being able to care about the characters, I failed to sense anything dark enough to be disturbing or erotic enough to be really sexy. The book was mildly entertaining--adequate to break up an 8 hour international flight--but I can't agree with all the rave reviews. Perhaps I've read too many Anne Rice books to switch to vampire romances."
2,Not What it Could Have Been,"I picked up this 2nd book in the Dark Hunter series after reading her first one: Fantasy Lover. The first book was great! This one just isn't. I've read the reviews and am surprised by the high score. I tend to usually agree with the majority of reviews out there.My main reason for disliking this book were the reactions between the characters. It felt like a forced attraction, lacking any genuine feelings. Every other paragraph they're staring longingly at each other on the inside but every external actions happening around them don't match with the internal monologues. Instead of creating depth and conflict, to me, it only rings untrue.It's like the author keeps reminding herself that it's a romance book and therefore it must be time to throw in some romance-type dialogue. Overall, I was very disappointed."
3,Good but...,"I bought this book after having tried Fantasy Lover which was much more funny and entertaining than this novel. All the ingredients of a popular, modern romance novel are there (see all the glowing reviews just on Amazon.com). Yet I found the plot meandered around a lot and I skim read several sections to get on with the real action. I had the sense while reading the book that Kenyon is laying the ground work for the future Dark Hunters series at the expense of this particular story. But, this was a good trashy read, and I always like to read books where the author has a sense of humour!"
3,sexy and exciting,"Exciting Paranormal Romance. Kyrian is sexy and he alone is worth the read. The chemistry between the characters constantly leads them to a steamy sex scene. During one scene unique in this, the couple held a element of a shared power while in the act. Hot!Lots of excitment is stuffed in these pages with no room left to get bored. But a warning, SK's story telling is often like that kid's whose making up all the rules as they go along. Some out of the blue thing happens, then, sure to follow; some simple matter-of-fact explanation. It reads like that. Because once upon a time, cause this is why, cause that's the rule, cause ..."
2,Booooring!!!,"I read for pleasure - sometimes to learn something. I'm about half way through this book and will be real happy to be done with it.The sex every other page thing is waaay stupid - not tantalizing, just stupid. Unfortunately, after reading the good reviews, I bought a series of her books. UGH!!! Good thing they are a fast read........"
5,Night Pleasures,"This book (Night Pleasures) is wonderful, I have read it so many times, I have soft and hard copy. I have also got the Audiobook.There are no words that can describe how wonderful Sherilyn Kenyon."
2,"Great story and book, but there's a reason the Kindle version is $2.99","I love my Kindle. In fact, I'm in the process of converting all my paperbacks to Kindle versions (eBaying the paper, buying the Kindle version). The Dark Hunter series is one of my favorites, and while Night Pleasures is not my favorite in the series, it's a good read. I'd give it 4 stars.The reason for two stars in this reviews? The Kindle version SUCKS. It's rife with typos. The words ""wife"" and ""with"" are almost always interchanged: ""Kyrian went wife Amanda..."" ""His with, Theone,..."" There are TONS of other examples where I've been forced to puzzle out a word with context clues. Absolutely inexcusable, in my opinion.At $2.99 it's still a good buy, especially if you're trying to complete the series or, like me, thin out your ""book clutter"" but be aware that it reads as if some psycho spell-checker edited it and not a live person."
2,"Sorry, try again. This recommendation didn't work.","... The story line contains the worst mishmash of vampire lore and off-the-wall Greek mythology I have ever seen. The plot is inconsistent, the dialogue so-so at best, and the resemblance to real vampire novels pretty close to non-existent.I will admit that there was one amusing concept that I liked: when Kyrian has to go somewhere in the daytime, he gets protected from daylight by calling an ambulance and being carried out in a body bag. This, however, is a couple of pages in a thick-ish book; certainly not worth reading the entire book just to get this bit.I would hesitate to read another book by this author, after my experience with this one... In my opinion, she should stick to non-fantasy romance."
2,Disappointed....,"I read the first book in the series and thought it was OK. I hoped this book would be better, however I was wrong. I found that there were too many references to characters throughout the book and that I had no idea who they were - I suppose they are in future books in the series but it did throw off this story too much. The different categories of vampires and the names used for them was confusing. I felt like I needed a cheat sheet to keep track of them. Also, I must be rusty on my Greek mythology because all the ""Gods"" and their connections to each other was exhausting. Finally, I found it aggravating that the heroine had to be plain, too tall, elfish faced, etc. while the hero was ""perfect"". I would like to have the heroine have some redeeming physical qualities."
4,seeing old favorites again,"i really enjoyed seeing the highlites on the 1st disc as it took me back to when i was growing up. one of the most emotional episodes was the cast telling big bird that mr. hooper died. however i wasn't into the 2nd disc. ok, i did like the 80's clips but i'm not a fan of the way they cleaned the street. everything looks a whole lot different and i'm not one for change. anyway, if you looking for some great clips of past episodes...this set is for you."
4,Blast from the Past,I ordered these DVDs because I cancelled my cable since the only thing we watched on it was Sesame Street. I have a two year old and a 5 month old who both watch it. I always missed the old Sesame Street. These DVDs are 5 hours of fun. With the old favourites like Super Grover and Kermit The Frog Newsflash. And some great recent skits like Elmo's World and Feist's 1234. Some of the old animation is really neat to see too. I am so glad I ordered it and will be ordering more.
4,Not too bad,I was overall pleased with this but the 2nd disc had too much elmo material. I prefer the older stuff. They left out a lot of classic clips from the 80's and 70's but overall it was a well done disc!
4,Great Purchase,I purchased this for my 18 month son & my 20 month niece for Christmas. My son is a huge fan of Sesame Street and I like purchasing him these DVD's because mom & dad don't mind watching either. LOL. Great purchase!!
3,Would have liked more on first 20 years,"Definitely worth a look to anyone who, like me, grew up on the show in the '70s and '80s, but I have to agree with the reviewers who wanted more of this era. I didn't even bother to watch the second disc, which concerns itself with 1989-2009.Snippets of the show, sketches, behind-the-scenes stuff, all good. Sorely lacking, though, is the pop-up facts special bonus feature.The Muppet Show - Season One (Special Edition)includes the same feature but does it SO much better than what can be seen here. On the ""Sesame Street"" presentation it seems like an after thought, thrown together hurriedly and edited VERY poorly (if at all). Some of the ""facts"" as worded just flat out don't make sense."
4,Mommy,I remember all of these from my childhood and I'm so glad that these episodes have been put together in one package so my daughter can grow up with them.
3,A nice look back at the old Sesame Street but...,I thought that this was all the episodes complete and it isn't. It is just a couple bits from each season. There are no full episodes and as far as I have gotten through so far there is no segments on the characters just being on Sesame Street and interacting. So far it is all the little cartoon bits that Sesame Street had. But it is still a decent DVD for the little ones and is something that will entertain them. Not a horrible DVD to own. Just not what I expected so I am a little disappointed.
1,Disc Broken,"When I received this product, I noticed a crack in disc one. It broke within days of using it :(. My daughter and I are sad. I'm hoping they can replace it!"
5,Amazing,Love this. One of the best purchases I have ever made. It is so great to be able to relive some of my best memories...
5,One of the BEST Sesame Street Sets You Could Get!,I ordered this DVD set here on Amazon for my 12 month old. He is now 17 months and still watches it like everyday! HE LOVES IT!! There are alot of songs and fun clips in this set. And they are all short clips so it keeps my son's attention VERY WELL! But it is jam packed with fun songs both old and new. Gets 5 Stars from us!
4,A quality children's show,I am an American living in Norway and bought this for my 2 year old so that she could hear more spoken English. Her and I both thoroughly enjoy watching these DVDs. It is so fun that she enjoys a show I grew up watching. This is a good mix of old and new skits and songs. It is nice to see that kids can be entertained by shows that are not animated and they actaully might be learning something also.
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"My grandkids fell in love with the Old School Sesame Street that I had checked out from the library. So... I bought this 40 Years set because it was more economical. But it is not the same. Even the two and a half year old grandkids noticed. 40 Years is mostly songs by guest artists and random skits. Also, the focus is more on self esteem rather then learning. I was disappointed. So, my husband (the grandpa) is going to splurge and we are going to get both vols. of Old School."
1,The Title is completely misleading,"I purchased this expecting to get all 40 seasons of Sesame Street. What I got instead were just hilites and snippets of various seasons, like a highlight video. So buyer beware, this title is very misleading. It should say ""portions of 40 years of sunny days"" or ""a few sunny days over the last 40 years of our show"" or something to that effect. I got all my larnin' from watching Sesame Street as a kid. So that is why I am a careful reader and notice things like this. I am sure Bob and Cookie Monster and Maria etc would agree with me. Which reminds me, in retrospect, I think my first sexual attraction was to Maria on those shows. Yes, I was a randy kindergartner. Its too bad they never did a show in the nude or maybe even an x rated version of Sesame Street. Think of the possibilities! It would have been a huge seller."
1,"Beware, Mr. Hooper's death episode","Yes, I love Sesame Street, but included in this video is the episode where Mr. Hooper is no longer alive. They were remiss to include the episode, because it is very suddenly sad. Your child may not have any experience with death/ loss of a loved one, so it could be quite confusing, especially when taken out of context! Or, if you have had a recent loss, you may not want this video around in your collection."
5,Take a break and enjoy some down time with your child...you both deserve it!,A trip down memory land and a way to catch up with artists and performers from the years I missed viewing before I had my own kids! This set is an awesome resource for preschool children through about age eight. All the original Sesame Street characters are represented and the more recent additions are included too. You'll love it as much as your kids because it's one of those rare sets you won't mind watching over and over again WITH your children. There are so many sunny days that it takes awhile to get through them all anyway!
2,Not what I was expecting,I bought this for my pre-schooler thinking it was various full episodes of Sesame Street. Perhaps I missed in the fine print that this is merely clips of various segments throughout 40 years. It seems to be more focused on clips with famous guest starts than it does actually teaching the young viewer..... and many of the clips are with people whom my child would have no clue as to who they are. I'm very disappointed in this.
4,Great buy.,This is a must for any Sesame Street collector. Had excellent bonuses on each disk. Brought back many good childhood memories.
4,worth the buy!,"I bought this for my 7 month year old and she loves it! I give it 4 stars because Disc 1 is not as good as disc 2...but, Disc 2 is super! Elmo comes out a lot and it has good music with great artists. Its one of the best distractions she has...she watches it over and over and doesn't get bored."
5,track listing for the bonus disc,"wonderful album...and for those curious, here is what's on the bonus disc:2-1 Pre 5:352-2 Fear 4:302-3 Decline 4:442-4 Paperback Bible (With Drums) 6:04"
4,Great for a review or conversational practice,"This would be great for a review for someone wanting to brush up dusty French skills. The recordings are great, and match the text, which gives the French dialogues along with colloquial English translations. The grammar sections of each chapter cover the recorded dialogues very well, and give good examples (which are in the text and on the recordings after the dialogues), but the examples and explanations are very brief. There are a few exercises at the end of each chapter - good for a review quiz, but not so good for learning drills, etc. I give it four stars not because I don't think it's a fine course, but because it should state more clearly what it is in the title. It is advanced conversational French practice, not a complete advanced French course."
5,Awesome book!,"We wanted to find unique and erotic ""adult only"" vacation spots to choose from without searching for endless hours on the internet. This awesome book puts it all together with all the information you need right at your fingertips. Well done! We highly recommend it!"
5,WoW! This Book IS an Adventure!,"Browsing through ""Adults Only Travel"" got my creative juices going. What a treasure trove of adventurous destinations. If you have an open mind and are looking for romantic and erotic places to romance your partner. . . buy this book! I'm considering a second honeymoon!"
1,Very Thin and Out of Date,This book lists the obvious tropical resorts and lifestyle parties but is very thin in the drive to resorts and destinations with in the USA. I'd didn't think it was worth the money.
4,Not bad at all !,I was shopping for a little back-up camera to keep in my case with my 35mm SRL and I had not bought a digital pocket camera and wanted to play with it on the computer and I was amazed at what this little cam could do! clear sharp pic's and eazy to use !besides I got a deal in store at target on discount about $45.00 off retail and that makes me even more happy!not a bad camera and what a deal. chaching!!!!!
4,Different kind of lipstick/gloss,"The way this is applied is with a spongelike tip and it goes on very smoothly. It doesn't last as long as the ""long lasting"" products on the market, but it feels good on your lips and the color I chose,'Freedom' was a good choice even though I chose it on-line. I would recommend that you try it."
2,why this book is not so good!,"I hated the art in this one. you can see from the start the art is very good, very detailed. But if you look at the last few pages it is very visible that the art has gone sloppy! Ripley's character looks and feels very lifeless and dull, I can imagine her in this comic talking like she's extremely bored and tired. The aliens were very plain, they looked balloony and cartoonish. The drawings past the first half of the book look like sketches, they looked very wobbly and almost as if the artist was rushing them. On the better side the story might interest you as it deals with Ripley's psychic relationship with the Aliens, and it gets in depth with Amy and Burt, the two characters who were featured in Nightmare Asylum. I didn't prefer this kind of story too much, but you may. Overall, horrible art, ok story that might be a good story to other people."
4,Everything Old Is New Again,"It's no news to anyone familiar with the punk industry or who have read other reviews of this album, but the Buzzcocks are a 25-year-old punk band. While that might pale in comparison to the billions of years that the Rolling Stones have been touring, it's still an impressive record for a punk band that rarely made their well-deserved limelight.This self-titled offering is jam-packed with the driving guitar one expects from the band behind ""Fiction Romance"" and ""Autonomy,"" giving the listener new and seminal offerings like ""Friends"" and ""Sick City Sometimes."" Through the entire album the punk sounds of the Buzzcocks that fans know and love never wanes; and through that classic sound comes forth tunes that manage to still sound new.The self-titled ""Buzzcocks"" is certainly worth a listen and is an excellent example that bands, even as they age, can give the fans exactly what they want and expect without becoming trite and overly self-referential."
4,Canon Powershot Tx1 Rocks the little guy,This little guy has a little of all the features in demand plus a few. It's size is so small that it will fit in a pocket. The intructions are easy to read and apply. Haven't used all the features yet but the ones I have used are great. Shudder time has small delay but also can be set for needs. I would recommend this over the straight camera or digital movie. Unless you are a professional or anal you can get and create wonderful results. For filming you will need a large storage card (8mg) so that you get more time to film. The conversion of time from stills to movie is huge as far as storage space. I recommend you get an extra battery so you are not caught short at the wrong time.
3,OK Camera and Barely OK Camcorder,"I have nothing new to add, but to reiterate, this camera performs well in well lit environment, but performs poorly in low light (both camera and camcorder functions). Also, I would like to see more controls and better placed external controls. The camcorder function is a memory hog, so get a large SD card if you're planning to shoot a lot of video (I have 8 gigs which equals about 30 minutes of video recording).All-in-all I'm satisfied with the purchase, but just barely."
4,"Aziz, light!","This camera needs light. The flash is weak. It does take a good video though, but again, in bright light. I just ordered the aux flash, I hope that helps the pictures. The size is nice, fits in the pocket, and it's great not to have to carry a len cap since it's built in. The battery is not long on life, so I ordered an extra one of that. The zoom is great for such a small camera. All in all, I am happy with it, the pros out weigh the cons."
1,Worst indoor video and pics!!!,"Ok I am being harsh on this one since of all the cameras I have ever owned this is the most disapointing.It does do nice video and pics outdoors.Indoors forget it. Very, very grainy video and pics.The flash is way underpowred.Best for use as a outdoor point and shoot camera only.The files for the HD video are very large and fill up that hard drive fast.Now as far as size it is very small and feels solid in your hads but because it is metal it sweets in your hand quickly!There are many other cameras that do a much better job for about the same price or less. Look at aiptek a-hd or go-hd if you want good pics and video plus much less money. Please note: that they both have much better video and pics indoors. But the subjects will need to be somewhat still or they may blur."
1,Auto focus now malfunctioning after a little dust.,For the past few months I would have given it 5 stars but just recently the auto focus started malfunctioning. And this IS NOT a complaint about slow focus. like I said I have used the camera for a few months!! I KNOW that its malfunctioning. Just beware there are other reviews of the same nature. And I would bet even the reviews about SLOW focus are actually malfunctioning. I would not buy this. Its to bad too it does have great features.
5,Fun toy,I enjoy using this camera. It's perfect for a person that like gadgets. 720p output to my 1080p Sharp Aquos LCDTV via component left a little to be desired but I don't know of any other camera this size that has the capabilities this one does.
1,"Broken, LCD Screen Dissplays White Only, Less Than Year Ownership",Broken White LCD Screen Display Less than Year OwnershipI have had this camera Canon PwerShot TX1 for less than one year and the LCD screen only displays all white now. This is very disturbing since I take such good care of the camera. [...] I would not recommend this camera since I am not the only one experiencing this problem. [...]
4,quite impressive,"Video quality is awesome in daylight. It is not that good in low light conditions, but 1- it is quite normal, 2- you cannot expect such a compact cam to behave like a $10,000 one.One thing I dislike is that you cannot have 2 different image ratio settings for pictures and videos at the same time. Meaning once you switch to 16/9 you also shoot pictures in this mode."
4,Great look at post-war Germany,"As Americans, it's easy to see the Germans as the bad guys, but few books have explored what it was like for the average German in the ""starving"" years after the war. While this book's main plot centers on a troupe of actors struggling to keep theatre alive in an ancestral castle, tons of details are supplied about what it was like for those trying to get across the East/West German border (refugees wrapping themselves in white sheets during the winter so they wouldn't be seen against the snow) and what life was like for everyday ""Joe Blows"" of Germany from 1946-1950. Considered a controversial novel at the time it was written (mid '50s) because it ""aired skeletons in the closet"", this novel grows on you. I liked it better the second time I read it."
5,dryer for cycle and car,"i'm excited that the blower came neatly packaged with full fixtures - although i will probably only use only one. came on time, worked right out of the box, of course. i have dried my buick once and the goldwing twice. this item is great for my needs and if the 8 amp version is twice as good, i recommend it. great item."
4,favorable,"dryer performed as advertised. I was drying my bike with several towels in maybe an hour, but with the Air Force Blaster was done in 15 minutes. I used it on my car,and while I don't think that I really saved any time, it was certainly easier."
2,there's no heat,"there is no heat on these blowers, after calling the company I was told the heat comes from the fan motor and would be more noticeable when the temperature is 75+ degrees outside. why would I need heat at that time?also, the legs are so small and short the blower falls over from the weight of the hose, if you're going to have one either mount it to a piece of plywood or cut/shorten the hose to about three feet, put a shoulder strap on it and it should be usable.in my case I'll stay with the electric leaf blower, works as well on the car and cleans the driveway too."
5,Worth every penny.,"I have been using air to dry my cars and motorcycles for years, I happen to be in the vacuum cleaner business and I built one similar to this. This Metro Air Force blower is superior, it gets the water off with no effort at all. My car has vinyl racing stripes on it and if I towel dry them the finish gets minute scratches in the vinyl and they have to be waxed out, so if I used high pressure air, I don't have to touch the stripe and I get no scratches on them. After I blow off my car, I use a small microfiber cloth to get any remaining water. The price on Amazon was less than what I would pay from Metropolitan Vacuum and I am in the business. My only negitave comment would be it needs larger stabilization legs on it so it dosen't roll over, no big deal, I am either going to mount it in a plastic tool box or put wheels on the bottom from a larger Metro vacuum."
5,Great tool to dry the car!,I used it the first time on 5/1/11 after I first dried my car with a microfleece towel. Then I used the Air Force Blaster Dryer and more water than I have ever seen blew out of crevices in the seams and light bezels. No water spots at all! The only recommendation I would make as a previous poster submitted is to fashion a shoulder sling to carry the blaster unit around the car. A modification by the manufacturer would be a plus.
4,satisfied customer,I got tired of lugging my leaf blower around while drying my car so I decided to try this product.It performs very well. it is a bit weighty but i purchased 2 belts and slid them through the handle and made a sling to hang on my back...problem solved. Noise level is slightly lower than my leaf blower which I am sure the neighbors appreciate.Made in USA...try finding that now days. Buying through Amazon is also a great experience.
1,Not 4 HP,"If it uses 9.5A at (say) 120V, this means 1.14 kW. The weediest HP (metric) is 736W. So if this unit were 100% efficient it would be 1.55 HP.Assuming (say) 80% efficiency it would produce 1.24 HP.So, to claim 4HP is ridiculous.Some will accuse me of pedantry, but the main way we can judge these products it to look at the figures. Quoting a figure that is three times the actual surely must be viewed as dishonest."
3,Not worth the money,The dryer is good for getting water out of hard to get at places. However it keeps blowing water back onto places you have already dried and you must go over it and over it. You don't save time and you end up with lots of water spots that you have to polish out. Save your money and do it by hand. Use you leaf blower.
2,Ad hoc,"A good primer on the chord notation one is apt to encounter in fake books and jazz charts, but it falls far short when it comes to common-practice harmonic theory. Covers all manner of esoterica like added 9ths and 13ths and diminished and augmented variations, but the material on how chords function in relation to one another is sketchy and unconvincing to this university music department graduate. Better to stick with Piston."
3,recommended for non-music majors,"This is a helpful, fairly thorough look at certain aspects of harmony. Some of the nomenclature is non-standard, and certain of its suppositions are questionable, but it is always interesting, and to a significant extent it is useful.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
2,Almost Worthless,This is a good book if you already know the material and want to have a nice print-out of what you know. But if you are in the process of learning the material you will have more questions than answers. Looks to me like a community college music teacher's idea of some arcana he can use to impress his students.
4,Nonstick pan,"I have owned this for about 2 months and use it nearly every day. I like the size as I cook for 2. I cannot comment on its longevity yet as I don't know how well it will stand up to extended use.I use a plastic spatula and a wooden spoon for utensils as I have with all nonstick cookware. The only change I have made is I am cooking at a lower temperature. I think a high temp may have ""killed"" my more expensive pans. I will let you know in one year how it has held up. The red dot is the middle is useless but otherwise I am pleased with its performance so far."
5,T-Fal Ultimate Hard Enamel 10.25-Inch Nonstick Fry (Saute) Pan,I went out and looked at a lot of pans. I looked at a lot of pans online. I finally chose this one and have been very pleased with it so far. It seems to be well constructed and it is not too heavy nor too light. And there are plenty of those.
2,Lack of proper description,"I got the product, and it did NOT come with any screws it's a tool mount, but it didnt come with mounting supplies??? the actual product is effective but i had to go out and get screws when i could have just went out and bought the product. the descriptino did not impply that it came without the screws, it did however immply that it was ""complete"""
3,Not up to the usual,"If you're a true Clancy fan (The Hunt for Red October, Rainbow 6, etc.) then this is not the book for you. While still good, it lacks the intrigue, suspense, and depth we've come to know and appreciate from Clancy. This is truly a very scaled down version written for young people."
2,Used Book,Book took 42 days to arrive. It did not seem to be in good condition as it not only had a folded front cover but also a torn back cover.
4,An entertaining book.,"This Tom Clancy created book is an easy read and is entertaining.This series of books is aimed at the younger reader and takes you into the lives of a group of kids that are part of the ""Net Force Explorers"". The Explorers are a program created by Net Force, the agency charged with fighting crime on the internet.Follow the kids on their latest adventure to help their friend Julio and his family.This is an action packed story that kept me hooked until I was finished. Buy this book today, you won't be disappointed."
2,CAN'T CHOOSE 1 or 2 stars,I am an avid Net Force reader but this book was the worst. I loved the detail in the aircraft simulations but hated everything else. Please don't read this book if you aren't an avid Net Force Explorer.
1,Clancy's name cannot help this from sinking,"Ok, I've given Clancy a chance with his net force project, but it is obviously not a good example of his work, nor good writing. Although the plots investigate corruption and high tech crimes, I am still unsure of the target audience (possibly 12 year old boys) based upon the level of writing. If you are a die hard fan, skip this one. Otherwise it will damage your impression of all other Clancy books. Tom clancy, if you read this, I'd like my money back for all those net force books. Please spare us!"
1,Review Of A Bad Book,"This book was OK. I got it after reading Cybersspy, which is also a Net Force book. That book trapped me in and I couldn't get out. This one never hooked me in. I read it because I had it, not because I liked it. If you want a good thriller, get Cyberspy or I Know What You Did Last Summer by Lois Duncan. If you want this, go ahead and get it, but you might regret it in the long run. Believe me. And click yes on the ""Was That Review Helpful To You?"" because, believe me, this review will help you. Steer clear of this book. Do me a favor, don't buy this."
5,Fantastic,"Michael Tilson Thomas is truly one of the great living conductors. The things he has been doing with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra for a decade now have been wonderful. This is one of the conductor's earliest collaborations with RCA Victor in selections from Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet. Although other reviews have summed up most of my feelings on this CD, I do just want to emphasize MTT's musical vision in creating his own suite. The performance is incisive, dramatic, forceful, and thoroughly pleasing. As always, the SFSO plays with totally conviction and total faith in their music director. As one of the leading Russian experts of today, MTT has created here a fantastic disc."
3,The Gramaphone Was Right,"As one of my favourite pieces of music of all time, I thought it was about time I had a new recording of such, as my old cassette tape was long gone. Ha! I briefly skimmed over the reviews below and they looked good, to me, and the price was right, so I went ahead with the buy.Sadly, from the very beginning I knew I'd made the wrong buy. I missed the reviewer's comment below referring to the Brit's disdain; the ""'slick efficiency' and 'stickiness'"". Spot on! Facile, prissy, and too pristine were the first thoughts that came to my own mind. Soulless. Disappointed."
5,Awesome!,"My brother loved it and went on to tell me that they only make two white tool tshirts, and that now he has both! Size was right and everything!"
3,"Handy, but potentially disastrous","It's always good to have a little knife or flashlight on you, but this memory stick comes up short. The biggest problems with the ""Swissbit"" was that it had its own software that supposedly helped you stay more organized. I've always thought this was a stupid idea since it's easy enough to make folders on your flash drives. The one good feature was that it could synchronize with your My Documents folder on your home computer. This dumb software proved disastrous when I plugged it into a Mac, and then couldn't open any of the folders. I was freaking out, especially because it had my masters thesis on it. I had to download a file recovery software program to get my files off of it. Plus, you could buy a little Swiss Army knife and a flash drive for probably $30 instead of the $70 or more that they charge for these things. That said, I loved having them integrated, and I'm always disappointed to not have a knife on me when I need it."
5,Army,"I think so this product is very good, very efficent for job in computer and stiled for people wiht category. thanks."
5,Excellent,"This is a really wonderful book and pretty damn close to being exactly what I was looking for, since it isn't as if I have a support group or anything of that nature. This work gives some background and myth, as well as a feeling of ""not being alone"", which is quite rare. I liked the combination of literary and historical viewpoint combined with the author's personal perspective, though the conversation between the literary characters was a bit much."
2,I was disappionted.,"I was very excited about this book, but I have to say I was disappionted. I bought all the expensive supplies needed to create her recipes....and got busy baking. The three recipes that I have tried were just ok... I found the sweetness of the candy to be bitter at times. I also was very unhappy to find that Steel's has uped the price of Maltitol to $17.95 for two pounds. I do realize that Low Carb is expensive, but I find that price to be beyond ridiculous! I sure hope someone comes up with a better, less expensive way to create sweets for those of us who want them from time to time."
5,You'll like it!,"I just saw Craig in concert at our local state fair, which is fairly small compared to the Lower 48. Craig put on an awesome show and I'd go see him again, if I could. His voice is awesome, the songs were great and I have no doubt, that if you like country music, songs with feeling, you will like this CD!"
4,Craig Morgan: Most under-appreciated Country artist today.,"Listening to Craig is like taking a walk in a cool light rain that breaks the heat of a hot summer day...it just feels, well, comforting, refreshing and pure.We have all his albums and there isn't a clinker on any of them. Each song is solid. No fillers.If you get a chance to see this guy in concert then TAKE IT.Keep it up Craig. God bless you."
5,Wow and I don't like country,Craig Morgan rocks!What an awesome voice. His music has so much passion. Awesome. He's a new favorite.
5,A rarity...,"This one is a rarity in today's music world... a blues album that is diverse, creative, completely true to the music & is loaded with smokin' guitar work that somehow escapes the cliches. If you want the next Stevie Ray you are in the wrong place, but this one has feel to spare, even when reworking classic blues tunes. I sure dig it..."
3,A Bit Too Ordinary for My Tastes,"Much of Blood Ulmer's music is a heady blend of jazz, blues, funk and rock run through the prism of his mentor Ornette Coleman's harmolodic approach to band interplay. While various of his recordings move one or more of these elements to the foreground, the final product is usually unique and original. Having gotten used to his ""far out"" sound and mind-stretching guitar work, NEFB:ELS seems kind of ordinary to me. But then I'm not all that much of a blues fan. If you come to this from enjoying his Odyssey, Music Revelation Ensemble, or solo work, you're liable to be a bit disappointed."
3,Good for intermediate/advanced AutoCAD users,"This is a great book and has come in handy now that I know AutoCAD but it was a little too difficult for me to start with. My teacher showed me a much easier book ""Exercise Workbook for Beginning AutoCAD 2002"" by Shrock Publishing. You can review it on their website. It made learning AutoCAD very simple. Also, why are these books so expensive. ..."
3,Programmers beware,"This books is better than the autodesk manual for showing you how to draw with AutoCAD and some of the drawing features. If you are looking for a book that explores how to customize AutoCAD using LISP, VBA or ObjectARX look elsewhere."
3,AutoCAD 2002 Bible,This book is more geared towards mechanical drafting rather than architectural drafting. But nonetheless it's a good book for referential purposes.
2,This linen is not a fine weave,"This latest entry in the Nuala Anne McGrail series by Andrew M. Greeley is a big disappointment. The main plot line promises more than it delivers, both in the solution and how the answer is found, and the secondary plot line wouldn't be a puzzle at all if the characters simply read faster. When the book doesn't drag it can be annoying. The sex scenes and discussions thereof are not as steamy as the author seems to think they are; overall they struck me as sophomoric. The voice in Desmond's head (carried over from earlier books) appears only sporadically and not to great effect, and Nuala's ability to ""see things"" seems to have some convenient gaps. There are hints of possible post-partum depression or some such that are neither developed nor resolved. I found it difficult not to just skip to the end to see how things turned out; but honestly, having read the whole book, I don't know that I would have missed much by doing so."
4,Nuala Anne is always a good read!,I enjoy all of the Nuala Anne books by Andrew Greeley. This book is the only one I had a little trouble getting into at first. But by the end of the book I was completely engrossed in the secondary story line. When I finish this series I plan to to start the Blackie Ryan series.
5,My favorite of this series,"I've enjoyed most of Father Greeley's Nuala Anne series, but this was the only one I was more interested in the historical story than I was in the contemporary story. The story of the Irish Ambassador who befriends Claus von Stauffenberg, the man who tried to kill Hitler and was the subject of the recent film ""Valkyrie"" is high romance. ""Timmy Pat"" falls in love with Annalise, a young cousin of Claus's wife, when she's a teenager and stays in love for over 10 years, even after she marries a German officer and is widowed. Timmy Pat is determined to save her. They're both fictional, but Claus and most of the other characters are not. The contemporary mystery of the young Chicago man who's gone missing in Iraq is not quite as interesting in comparison."
3,"Review of audio, not the book","I have always enjoyed Mary Higgins Clark's books, and this one is a real page-turner. But the audio version is a different story. It is hard to concentrate on the story as so many words are mispronounced. Greenwich, CT is not ""Green-which,"" but ""Grenn-ich."" ""Brusquely"" is not ""brooske-ly."" And ""been"" rhymes with ""bin,"" not ""bean."" The list goes on. (And then there is the reader for Sara Paretsky's Chicago-based mysteries who pronounces Chicago Cubs icon ""Harry Caray"" as ""Harry Cuhh-RAY. Sheeshhhh......)"
3,Predictable,"This was the first Mary Higgins Clark book I ever read, and, since it was the first, I wasn't able to guess the ending (like I have with the others). But for someone who has read many books by Clark and figured out the ""formula"" for how to guess the killer, this is a very predictable book. If you are new to Mary Higgins Clark's books, this will be interesting and unpredictable."
2,"Review of the Audio, Not The Book","I've enjoyed a number of books by Mary Higgins Clark in the past. This story line sounded good, but I just couldn't get past the voice of the narrator; she made Molly sound like an empty-headed child. I actually couldn't continue listening because the voice annoyed me so much."
4,Very suspensful!,"I enjoyed this book very much. I liked it because along with others by MHC, it's based on events that could actually happen in real life. The HMO problem for example along with the murders really kept me interested. It's a very fast reading. It took me a day, because i couldn't put it down! It's a great new book1"
4,"Not as good as some, but much better than the last few!","I didn't find Ms. Clarks latest formulaic at all. It wasn't as good as Weep No More My Lady or Loves Music, Loves to Dance, but I liked it a lot better than the last few. It wasn't quite as suspenseful, but I had a harder time figuring out the killer in this one. I had him pegged by the second chapter in the last two! All in all, I found it to be a very enjoyable read."
2,No one to root for in this formula novel!,"The lack of a sympathetic character made this book hard to finish - the only thing that kept me going was the fact that I'd bought it in hardcover. The Mary Higgins Clark formula plot did not work this time around, especially at the end with a most anti-climactic confrontation scene. A big disappointment."
2,Not one of her best!,"I was a little disappointed in this book. The plot just seemed to drag on and on with very little action. I put the book down several times and was almost tempted just to turn it back in to the library. Whatever you do, don't buy it!"
4,"Better than her last few, but not as good as her early works","Mary Higgins Clark is still one of the few authors I buy the day her new book goes on the stand, even though her last few novels have been predictable and a bit lacking in color.""We'll Meet Again"" has more depth and suspense than her recent works. The characters were developed nicely and the plot twisted well. The length of the book was just right.The only problem with most of Clark's novels is that her ""whodunit"" is extremely predictable.For past Higgins Clark readers, this book is definitely worth picking up. For new Higgins Clark readers, I would recommend reading one of her earlier novels first."
3,This book was all right.....,"Not very impressed with reading my first Mary Higgins Clark. She's been recommended to me by many people and this book just didn't catch my attention the way that I thought it would. I read it, and I finished it. That's it. I would only recommend it if you didn't have anything else to do..... ie: laundry, dishes, etc."
4,Great Book. Typical Mary Higgins Clark,Captivating from the first page. I couldn't put it down. Hard figuring out WHODUNNIT?
5,She tied up the loose ends!,"MHC has done it again. There is not one book that I haven't read. I especailly like the way she tied up all the loose ends of this story. She kept me in suspense til the very end. You usually ""think"" you've solved the mystery and then ""wham"" she surprises you."
3,Fine until the end,"I enjoyed this book until the final few chapters. I didn't feel she ""wrapped"" it up with enought details to explain important parts of the book. Could someone please explain how/why Molly was covered in her husband's blood; what exactly happened to her that she didn't remember events from that night; why wasn't the statue ever dusted for prints...? I skimmed the book for answers to these questions upon completing it, but came up empty handed. Maybe I overlooked them. Could anyone shed some light? Thanks."
1,A struggle to read,This was the first Mary Higgins Clark novel that I have read after she was recommended to me - I won't bother reading any of her other books as I found this book tough to get through. I kept thinking that if would improve but it never did. It was such an unbelieveable plot and the ending wrapped up so quickly that some questions were left unanswered.
2,Never again,"Well, she's improving. I once read a novel by this woman that used the word ""fisted"" obsessively.. as in ""she fisted her hands on her hips"". I mean, this term appeared in a slightly different sentence every few pages to describe her female protagonist...throughout the entire book! I found this so unbelievably distracting and annoying, that I actually quit paying attention to the plot and became somewhat obsessed myself with ""is she REALLY going to do it AGAIN? "". I don't like turning nouns into verbs or vice versa (i.e. calling a book a ""read"")so that was part of it. But really, I have never seen a major author do such a thing before. What I mainly want to know is: HOW DID THIS GET PAST HER EDITORS? One of life's little mysteries..."
1,Disappointed,I have ready all of Mary Higgins Clark's books and have enjoyed them. Not this one. I can normally finish her books in 2 days. I have been reading this one on and off for 2 weeks! It is extremely slow and boring. The characters are bland. It just doesn't grab you. It's like watching paint dry. Sorry Mary!
5,Enjoyed!!,A woman goes to prison for a murder that she claims she didn't commit. She gets out and thirty-two-year-old assistant prosecutor Emily Wallace takes the case to help her find out what really happened. Although Emily believes that she's guilty.This is a good relaxing read and I couldn't wait to get back to it after work. Good mystery.
4,To Clear Molly's Name,"A respected doctor Gary Lasch was found dead with a blow to his skull. This shows an act of rage. Of course his wife Molly is arrested. The trial was not going well and Molly accepted a plea bargain rather than facing a possible murder conviction. Molly when she is released is determined to clear her name with the help of an old school friend, Fran. There is also the suicide of her father on the night of her graduation that she had never accepted. Molly has more and more questions as the investigation unfolds. Fran finds herself in great danger when she opened the Pandora box of intrigue and danger in her investigation. This is one of Clarks best stories. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
3,Very Suspenseful.....,"I think, We'll Meet Again was a book that when I started reading it grabbed my attention, but then it became like a never ending story. I think that some chapters weren't even needed in the book. However, the whole book in general was very suspenseful, the ending shocked me. Mary Higgins Clark is a great author. I can't wait for the next one!"
1,This is her worst book ever!!!,"The premise of the book- ""young wife with amnesia kills husband who happens to be a doctor and no-one believes in her innocence except for a scrappy reporter with a past"" plays like a bad detective novel with a really dense set of supporting characters. This book was definitely not the caliber of earlier Mary Higgins Clark. The character's are one dimensional and the dialog is sometimes hilarious and often stilted (no-one talks or thinks this way). It appears that this one is simply a book that she had to write to get the publishers off her back."
4,Bravo Mary!,I read this book and loved it. I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark's books. My mother introduced them to me and I have enjoyed all of them. I have read alot of reviews that this book wasn't good. Well I disagree. The book was awesome and I am looking forward to reading her next one. I also like that the books she writes are not full of sex and bad language.
2,Never again,"Well, she's improving. I once read a novel by this woman that used the word ""fisted"" obsessively.. as in ""she fisted her hands on her hips"". I mean, this term appeared in a slightly different sentence every few pages to describe her female protagonist...throughout the entire book! I found this so unbelievably distracting and annoying, that I actually quit paying attention to the plot, which was actually pretty good, and became somewhat obsessed myself with ""is she REALLY going to do it AGAIN? "". I don't like turning nouns into verbs or vice versa (i.e. calling a book a ""read"")so that was part of it. But really, I have never seen a major author do such a thing before. What I mainly want to know is: HOW DID THIS GET PAST HER EDITORS? I read this book mainly to find out if she got over her fit or whatever it was, and I was relieved to find out that she had."
2,Not one of her best,"I am a big fan of Mary Higgins Clarks books but I do not think this was one of her best.Too much focus on the world of healthcare.I could have done without that.Also the chapters were too short.I like longer chapters.So as I said,not one of her best.Hope her next book is better."
3,It Was OK,"I bought this book because I am a huge fan of Mary Higgins Clark, but it was kind of a let down.I just kept waiting for it to get started and it seemed like forever.However, it did start to pick up about half way but it still couldn't make up for the slow start.The best thing about this book was the surprise ending and that was about it."
4,We'll Meet Again,"We'll Meet Again is one of Mary Higgins Clark's best novels. I liked this book because it had a plot unlike any other books she had written. I also like the way Clark developed her characters because they keep you on the edge till the last page of the book. Set in the Cape Cod atmosphere, this book is wonderful reading. Molly Carpenter Lasch, wife of Gary Lasch, a successful doctor, is sent to prison for murdering her husband. It was supposedly said that she crept up behind him in his office and beat him with a large sculpture to death. Though she does not remember this, she admits to having done it with the facts the court has given her. She is sent to life in prison, but five years later, she is granted parole. Now that she's out of prison, Molly wants to uncover who killed her husband, who ruined her reputation, and who destroyed her life. The results are beyond your imagination."
2,Disappointed,"This is the first Mary Higgins Clark book that aI have read. I got it inexpensively (thank goodness) at the train station and passed the time during an 8 hour ride. The book lacked believability. The plot had few twists most of which were predictable. The characters were black and white and lacked depth. They were constantly tied together with coincedence. The underlying plot held no believability and in fact made no sense at all. Unless I missed the point of this story entirely, I cannot reccommend it."
3,Same as the rest,"I have read almost all of her books. This one reads just like the rest. If it were my first one, I may have liked it more; but they are starting to get old and monotonous. It's worth reading, but not her best."
2,Not one of Mary Higgins Clarks' better works.,It was difficult to get into; I found it hard to hold my attention. To much jumping around from character to charater; situation to situation. She has definitely written better books.
1,would give it 0 stars if I could,"The worst part of this book is that I paid good money for it. It is just plain awful. Poorly defined characters, hackneyed plot, and badly written dialogue. Skip this one!"
1,"A ""who cares"" whodunit...","This book was a waste of trees. Clark spent more time describing the clothes her characters were wearing at any given moment rather than trying to develop their personalities. The storyline was quite like a vaudeville show, designed to make you hiss at the villains and sigh at the dramatic entrances of the wronged Connecticut socialite. Don't bother with this one."
3,Fair,"The premise of this story is good--murdered husband, wife accused but can't remember the night he was killed. Once Molly (the wife) is released from prison she goes about proving her innocence. The only problem is that everyone believes she did it even her own lawyer. Only a highschool friend, Fran, is on her side.Somewhere in the middle of this book I just lost interest. It really started to drag. It took me over two weeks to finish it because I kept putting it down. Once I got to the ending I was glad that I actuallly finished because it was quite surprising."
4,suspense turner,"Mary Higgins Clark is a suspensful writer and has many, many unexpected irony throughout the book. She leaves you in suspense and will always leave you guessing. She is a great writer and I can't wait to read more of her books."
5,Exellent Story!,"We'll Meet Again by Mary Higgins Clark was an excellent book. I really enjoyed her style of writing because it was easy to understand and was very suspenseful. She keeps the reader thinking about more than one thing at a time. In one chapter, you're concentrating on one thing, and in the next chapter, it's something completely different. I think that's what makes the book full of suspense. Mary Higgins Clark uses descriptive words so that you can actually see it in your head. She is so descriptive that sometimes her words gave me the chills. Overall, I give the book We'll Meet Again by Mary Higgins Clark five stars."
5,I love this book!,This book is one of Higgins' best. I have read almost all of her books and this time she out did herself. I was in total suspense up until the end. Well Done. I recommend this for all mystery fans.
2,Just Okay.,"Mary Higgins Clark now falls into the category of Danielle Steele where her first books were much better written than her later ones. This is a somewhat disappointing effort. You never quite like Molly; she is always the victim never showing any strength of character nor conviction - just weak, abused and shallow. This will be my last Mary Higgins Clark."
5,My First MHC was Fantastic,"Believe it or not, this is the first time I've read anything by Mary Higgins Clark and I loved it. Molly Carpenter Lasch, was tried and convicted of murdering her husband, Dr. Gary Lasch, despite the fact she remembered nothing about the night he was killed. After being released on parole, Molly asserts her innocence again in front of the media. Among the media, Fran Simmons, an old classmate of Molly's from high school, begins covering the story for the local television station for a segment called True Crimes. Molly agrees to an interview with Fran and convinces Fran to help her investigate the murder further in order to find the answers that are at the edge of her memory. During the course of the investigation, a key witness is discovered murdered only hours after Molly questioned the witness. This story holds the reader captive until the very end. Highly recommended."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"I always look forward to of MHC's new releases... but this time I should have done without. I think this book had great potential, but it approached the story through the eyes of every character. I found that it jumped around throughout the chapters--many times I read something in a later chapter that had occurred just a chapter ago!Although I will always be a MHC fan, I don't know that I can recommend this book others."
3,Coulda been better,"I have read other books of Clarks, and I think they were better than this one. I liked this book and even finished it in one day, but some of the characters (Molly for example) could have been better. I think she was portrayed poorly, and could have been made to look a little bit wiser. Otherwise I thought the book was definetly good, and I was non the wiser as to who the killers were, of course I always had my suspicions, but it took til the very end to be sure. A good read, just don't have very high expectations."
2,Not to thrilled,The book arrived wet and wasnt packaged well. The content of the book is great and considering I don't like to go through the hassle of returning I will deal with it but I was going to give it as a gift and since it wasn't packaged well and it was raining I cannnot. I am enjoying the writers content though since I decided to read the book.
4,A good book,"This book is good but is a little difficult for the first learner. If have already learned some basic algebra , it is ok to use this book"
3,Decent Graduate Text,"This is a decent graduate text for algebra. It can be a little dense at times and sometimes sparse on the details, but overall it's not a bad book. The only huge problem with it is that the binding was not well made and so the cover can fall off."
4,Hungerford- A Strong Book With Faults,"My impressions of Hungerford as an undergraduate student with a degree of aptitude towards mathematics. First, the text seems like a good text for strong undergraduates and lower-caliber graduates. Otherwise, an apt first-year grad student should not have problems reading a text like Lang's.The book is clear, relatively concise and really doesn't stray from the path of teaching elementary algebra till later in the text. This is useful, since a discussion of functors isn't likely to be on an undergraduate midterm about algebra. However, later in the text, Hungerford begins to rely on the axiom of choice/Zorn's Lemma to simplify some of his major proofs. I see this as a major detraction, since most of these proofs are independent of that axiom. As of this point, that's my major gripe with the text. Still, I would definitely suggest it to apt undergraduates."
4,"Impressive, if not so easy to read","As a reference, this is simply an amazing book; tons of information are crammed into this book. The flip side is that if you are seeing this information for the first time, the presentation can be a little daunting. I started using this book in a class last year and hated it at first, because the presentation of material here is very densely packed together and not written for maximum clarity. For example, the chapter on category theory was the first time I'd seen the subject, and I found it frustrating, unlike the presentation given by, say, Rotman in his Algebraic Topology text. All of that said, though, I appreciate the book more now looking back on the material. Overall, if you haven't seen the material before, this is a fine book as long as you've got someone to help you through the rough spots. As a reference, though, this book is extraordinary."
4,Getting DJ SCREW,"To anyone that really lives in Houston Texas, you know all the places to get screw. Amazon has done a good job on getting his mixes out there to the world. 3 in the morning, is a good cd, own a copy, but the Screws mixes on Point Blank is the best, if you like this album you will definitly like the point blank mix. It is hard to get, but if you (really) live in Houston you can find it, don't listen to screw like I used to got older but still good to kick back to once in a while."
5,"3 'n the Mornin', Pt. 2","This album is good for just driving around, taking your time, and enjoying life. The beats are amazing and the mixing of them are great. The only con of it is that it could be better quality audio, but remember, it came from tape, so don't expect hi-fi sound. True underground classic."
4,Moving and fulfilling,"I purchased this album after hearing a selection on the local classical radio station. Tracks 3& 4 ""The Prayer,"" are so graceful, peaceful. They lift my heart in a fulfilling way that is hard to describe. I like the symphony in its entirety, but those two tracks are very special. In addition, the ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" symphony on the latter tracks is similar when taken as a whole: a bonus."
1,TERRIBLE,"You know why there is no description of this DVD on Amazon? Because they would never sell it if they told you what was actually on it. DVD is 90% interviews, sound is terrible, and concert video clips look like they were filmed with a cell phone.Amazon: This DVD is a complete rip-off. Take it off your shelves and start giving better descriptions of the media you sell. You're getting lazy."
2,Just interviews,Too much interview and the images about the live show seem to be blured.It was the first time that i almost slept watching Metallica
5,Highly recommended!,"""Seeking Spiritual Direction"" was written by a highly educated and insightful expert on Catholic spiritual direction and the spiritual life. The book contains much needed insights and advice on spiritual direction in contemporary times including problems that may arise. A must read for spiritual directors as well as those seeking spiritual direction. I also highly recommend Fr. Dubay's other books includingFire Within: St. Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross, and the Gospel-On PrayerKathryn Marcellino[...]How to Pray the Rosary as a Pathway to Contemplation"
3,Chock full of great information in a boring format,"I heard about this book on EWTN Global Catholic Radio and was so excited to read it. But it's been about a year or two that I've had this book and still can't finish it. This is atypical for me with respect to books of a Catholic spiritual nature which I usually devour. The type is archaic and small, the question and answer format of the book seems limiting or reader-unfriendly, and reading this has been an absolute struggle. But if you can soldier on through all of this, the information is very valuable stuff that you won't hear elsewhere but with difficulty, because in these modern times, spiritual directors themselves don't necessarily open up so much about the pros and cons and discreet aspects of their work like this book describes."
4,post modern jazz,"If you mix avant garde classical music with jazz you get this off center piece. It's a bit crazy, but I liked it very much. You just have to appreciate some discordance in with your music to appreciate it."
1,Like buying aggravation,One of the two clips that hold the waste bag cover on kept falling off. The third time I had most of the dust bag contents back on the floor.Metro offered to repair it but I'd have to pay shipping; I returned it to Amazon instead.
4,Almost perfect,"In my handyman business, a small powerfull vac is a must. I've had several Dirt Devils, tried Oreck's Power Brush, and sent it back, because it, like the Dirt Devil handhelds are toys; their motors are wimpy. After trying the Vac n' Blo, I finally found a vac that isn't a toy, yet it's so quiet, you don't think it's going to have good suction, but it does- enough to run the optional power rug brush, which the Dirt Devil couldn't do without a belt powered by the motor. Why less than perfect? No attachment storage, and wheels would help, but they make you pay extra for that. But in the end, if you want a compact vac that's not a wimp, this baby is for you."
4,Great Vacuum,"I bought this for a car vac. I've only used it once so far, but it worked so much better than every other carvac i've ever used.Pros: small; powerful; easy to empty; sturdy buildCons: gets a little hot when in use for a while (however, it was hot in the garage, so i'm not sure how much that contributed)"
1,Unbreakable? HA!,"I got this for my birthday and loved it. Made great coffee--- until the plunger broke after 1 month. The plastic plunger is made of REALLY light weight plastic. A few cents worth of plastic to beef the plunger up would have made this 1-star into a 4-star. As it stands now, it's a bad design.I'll probably go with another brand in case the other Bonjour presses have the same problem. Or at least look at the plungers VERY carefully."
3,"Not bad, but there are better books on Deduction","Of the 9 books I've read on Deduction/Counting this is the one I liked least. Its not terrible, but the others are much better. Maybe this was considered a good book on the subject 40+ years ago, but there are not much better books.Its probably Intermediate plus/advanced, and not for Intermedaites or below.The bidding is outdated in a number of hands, and I don't think all the inferences are that solid.Start with Mike Lawrences ""How to Read Your Opponents Cards""Then read ""Countdown to Winning Bridge"" by Tim BourkeI think these books lay a better foundationI also liked:Card Placing for You - KambitesCard Reading - Eric JannerstenBetter Bridge for the Advancing Player - Frank StewartDormer on Deduction - Al DormerAll 52 cards is a fair book, with a wide variety of problems. I just think the instruction is not as good as in some of the others."
4,"nice leather case serves its purpose, but why do these things cost so much?","I like this little, leather case designed for the Sansa e200 series. The belt clip functions well and the player controls are accessible while the player is in the case. I like the leather flap that closes over the front of the player and also that it has a clear, plastic substance covering the player's screen when the flap is open.My only complaint about this product -- and it applies to every product in this category -- is that they are terribly overpriced for what they are. This item has a very small amount of leather and not much else to it, yet this item costs about as much as a pair of Skechers sneakers. Even worse are the ones that are made entirely out of plastic and polyurethane yet cost even more!"
3,Leather on clip peals off,"Overall I liked this case alot. The buttons are slightly harder to get to when the case is on, and it makes it very bulky, but the only actually bad thing about this case is the leather on the clip. After about six months, the leather began to peel off, exposing the cloth underneath the leather and the metal under that. After having it for a year I am starting to consider getting a new on that doesn't look quite as tacky. The only other thing I don't like about this case is that the hole in top for head phones can stop son head phone jacks with a large base from connecting completely."
5,quality,This is a great deal. The case fits well and is quality made. The price was very inexpensive.
4,"There are some errors in here from my old friend and fellow Revisionist Brad Smith, but overall a very good effort!","The errors are as follows:1) Mark Weber is not a 'racialist',2) Willis Carto DID not 'found the IHR -David McCalden and Lewis Furr did.3) Some of Brad's opinions and languagecould have been cleaned up a bit. Butone of the best Revisionist books inawhile. Bradley's plays and other booksare a bit better, but this one updatesthem well. Way to go young man!"
5,the Jim Hightower of the Revisionist set,"I wanted to read this book because 1. - I had seen the video ""David Cole Interviews the Director of the Auschwitz State Musuem"", produced by Cole and Smith. The video is online and you can google it - and 2. - I read a blurb where Smith's style was on display ..... a little like Jim Hightower meets Jack Kerouac. So, I bought the book. Unfortuntaely he doesn't even mention the video, which is an incredible kick in the groin to the Holocaust industry. However, he does relate an interesting life, and he does dissect some of the Holocaust sacred cows along the way. You can probably google 'Bradley Smith Elie Wiesel' for one instance and 'Bradely Smith Yankiel Wiernik' for another. All together a great, unpretentious book. I don't think I'll recover from this book."
3,not made for toddlers,"not as big as i thought, couldnt find any sheets that would fit the bed. with toddlers in the home it was hard keeping the items on its shelves from staying off the floor. would have liked some types of cabinets or something to keep little hands off. overall worked well and did its purpose for ages newborn to 15months."
5,strong,"always knew this girl was a powerful singer and on this song she proves itbrilliant ballad,will be played for years to come"
1,Fee Dig sites and Museums,"A real disappointment. I have looked over the ""Quadrant"" series by Eckart and it was much better. I would recommend a book search for the ""Gems and Minerals of America"" by Jay Ellis Ransom, it has much more comprehensive information and a lot more than even the ""Quadrant"" series contains. But of course local ""collecting guides"" are even better. Contact the clubs in the area you are going to visit and see if they will let you go on one of their field trips or suggest a location. I'm VP of the Montgomery Gem and Mineral Society, we would love to take you on a trip."
1,"Series needs more info to be useful, disappointing.","I personally have not purchased THIS book (SW) but have purchased the others in the series. I bought SE, NE and NW site unseen hoping it was something like Eckert's series. I was very disapointed. Very few sites are listed, most of those are very well known sites. In fact all of the sites listed in some states are only for mining or mineral museums! This may be a good book for kids or someone just getting started, but since Eckert's book has been republished, I really would point them there first. In fact, 5 minutes on the web can locate all the mining museums located in this book. Save your money for the Eckert series."
4,Taiko...Loved it!,"Well written and translated. Definitely not a book for beginners in this period of Japan. The names alone would baffle someone looking for light reading. Relatively accurate historically with a very compelling ""rags to riches"" storyline. A good, solid read for deveotees to this time frame."
5,Great Read,"This is the second novel I read from Eiji Yoshikawa and he didn't disappoint. Yoshikawa traverses the life of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, (Taiko), from his humble beginnings as a peasant in feudal Japan to his rise in power as the most powerful Daimyo in Japan. If you enjoy a colorful, detailed historical fiction novel then you will like this book."
3,Some good stuff!,"Not all of it was useful for me...probably would be for someone else...but a lot of it definitely improved some problem areas I had. Notably, some pain in the upper trap (just below the neck) on one side virtually disappeared after doing some of these routines."
5,A Blossom From A Barnyard,"Wow! Growing up on a farm in 1968. It was an experience to live.I think it's better than little house on the praire. This book puts you there in 1968 on that 40 acre farm. I learned how farming was through Judith's eye's was exciting. This book took me through adventure,and back through time. It is truly positive and inspiring. She shared the joy of owning a pony for the first time. Unexpected things thing's alway's happened. And the illustration's will blow you away. I think every kid should have one!It would be good reading material for school's. It will truly intrigue you. The reading is easy to follow and very enjoyable. I recomend it to everyone whoever wanted to be on a farm. Who has been on a farm.Or to those whoever dreamed of being somewhere other than they are right now. Or to anyone who just want's positive, non-violent,and enjoyable reading material."
4,Satisfied but ......,"""Shipped OK, but should note that item was in sealed packages rather than 2-pack box (as pictured) No idea as to expiration date, for the price, still an excellent value."""
5,The BEST for entertaining!!!!,"I bought this for my son a couple years ago as a Christmas present. We all enjoy it sooooo much! We use it mostly for parties, and people are always super impressed. Since you mix your own chocolate, it's such a better quality that what you can get at a caterer. Although the chocolate is messy, since all of the parts go right in the dishwasher, clean up is a breeze! One of the best gifts ever!!"
1,Product only worked one time,"I used the chocolate fountain once several years ago and when I got it out to use it again, it wouldn't turn on. If anyone is interested in parts, contact me."
1,only worked once!,"I bought this fountain for a holiday party that I had for 2008. After the event, I cleaned up my fountain and put it away nice and neat for the next years event. When I took it out of the box this year to get it ready for my 2009 holiday party, it would no longer work! I have messed with it and messed with it and I cannot figure out anything. $50 for something that only worked for one day? NOT WORTH IT. I would definitely advise a different model."
4,Mmmmm,"The fountain was a gift for my girlfriend to celebrate three years of dating. She loved it so much. The fountain worked well...the first time we used it, it didn't flow so great, but we turned it off and came back to it a little later and it worked perfect. Even when the flow wasn't as good it still flowed enough to get some tasty treats dipped in chocolate. This was a great product and I love it."
1,not worth buying,Do not bother purchasing this product! It did not work right out of the box. I should have believed the reviews I read. Buy a proven product instead. Return and refund was made easy by Amazon. No complaints there.
4,Fondue Fountain,"This was fine for the money. For how often we will use this, I didn't see the point of spending $200 for a fountain. This worked well and did what it was supposed to do."
1,Product did not work (at all),"Although my research indicated that this is likely the better brand of the chocolate fountains and the capacity is very convenient, the product did not work when I received it. The motor did not run, the heater did not work and the light didn't turn on.One recommendation: Check that it works before melting the chocolate. I was disappointed as the chocolate was delicious! Another point, I did not realize the chocolate required so much preparation, i.e. adding of oil and heating, before being put into the fountain."
1,"Very noisy operation, single-use - poor quality. Very disappointing.","I have owned two of these units. The first one worked only once before it stopped working altogether (not even the light would come on after the first use). I returned it and got a replacement, which operates so noisily that it is inappropriate for entertaining because you have to raise your voice to talk over the sound! I'm not expecting this second one to work after the gears grind themselves up on the first use.I'm very disappointed with this product. I will never purchase another Rival appliance again!"
1,Rival CFF4 Chocolate Fountain,"Wow, what a disappointment. I bought this fountain for my daughters graduation open house. I tried it at home when it arrived. It worked great and clean up was easy. I followed all of the directions completely. I put it away and waited for the big day. 2 hours before the open house started, I set it up, plugged it in, and nothing. I tried several outlets. I tested the outlets and they worked fine. The fountain light didn't come on, the motor didn't hum. I ended up melting the chocolate in a crock pot and serving it in little cups. What a rip off! I sure hope Amazon will help me get a refund."
4,Yummy!,"Overall, I loved my chocolate fountain. It was alot of fun and was quite delicious! Also I got my chocolate fountain for only $15 on Amazon when I could have payed $40 in a store. : ) One think that was a little bit of a disappointment was that it was a little bit challenging to clean up, but it does go in the dishwasher!"
2,This item doesn't work!!,"Bought this item, it never would turn on. Sent it back and Amazon sent me another one. It worked once then wouldn't work again. It is defective and not worth the money. Use a fondue pot or crockpot instead and you won't be disappointed!!"
3,Disappointing,After reading multiple reviews I was sure this would be a winner. It may be just me but I never really got into it and quit from boredum about 1/4 of the way through.
3,Great game but disc reading problems,"I Love this game for the wii. The controls handle beautifully and story line keeps it interesting. My only complaint is the fact that I get a DISC cannot be read error randomly, which until as of late, has been remedied by powering the Wii down and then back on again. Last night however, I couldn't get the disc to read at all after several attempts. Other disc's in my game collection worked just fine, but after putting MP3C back in, same error.I had similar problems with a Sonic and the Secret rings game, but sold it days after I got it just because I didn't like the game. I wonder if it's just my Disc, or if others have this problem. A Wii update is needed when you first play this game so i also wonder if it's the console.I just tried again to see if it would work today...booted into the game and went straight to game play w/o a hitch. I'm sure I haven't seen the last of the disc read errors though."
2,"A linear gamecube port, bad camera angles, but excellent controls","Nintendo has the Wii controls tight and intuitive in this bland, linear shooter. The character's pellet gun and silly puzzles make this game a yawner after the first hour. It wants to be clever by making you perform absurd tricks and moves by crouching into a ball. The camera angles can be annoying at times and the graphics are hardly stellar. Mario Galaxy and Zelda make much better use of the graphics engine on the Wii. Save your money and rent this lame game."
2,"For me , an exercise in tedium.","I'll start by saying I have spent countless hours playing Resident Evil 4 on the Wii and I did manage to finish the game as different characters. Enjoyed every minute. By comparison, after one day with Metroid , I was ready to sell it. But I came back to it several times for another try. This game's boss battles require hitting the B button continuously for several minutes. No finesse. The save points are too sparse , so unless you are an expert at this game , expect to have to lose progress or leave your Wii on overnight until you are ready to resume. Some of the puzzles are fairly difficult,not a problem, but some of the stages require timing that far surpasses me, even after days of attempts. Currently this game in on the shelf awaiting its next owner."
5,Metroid Prime - Review,Awesome game. I would say this is the best game for the wii so far. The boss battles are amazing the visuals are great. The controls are what make the game. if you want a real review go to IGN.
3,gets boring after awhile,"This game is good and has provided hours of fun. I like all the new stuff they added to the metroid universe, but this game gets really boring when you're at the half-way point, and you'll probably keep getting stuck causing much frustration.If you decide to get Metroid Prime 3, buy the players guide along with it."
2,Repetitive gameplay,"In the interest of disclosure, I bought this game for a friend; I did play it a bit, but mostly watched. We'd both recently been playing more on the PS3, and switching back to Metroid Prime 3 was disappointing. The controls were difficult to adjust to, the gameplay seemed fairly repetitive, and the story wasn't engaging. We wound up selling it to someone else after about a week."
3,Not That Great. Kinda Annoying.,"I was really looking forward to to Metroid on the Wii. After figuring out the controls and playing for a couple hours I stopped playing. It's annoying and by annoying I mean Really Frickin' Annoying. The graphics are not that great. Think Gamecube. The controls are not that great. The character animations are really horrible. I felt like I was playing the same ol' Metroid and sold the game. It's just not that great. Play the first Metroid game and you should be good to go. Save your bucks and buy something better this holiday season. There are many other new games with really state of the art graphics, art design, character animations, gameplay and fun out this year. I'd suggest other games but look at any game ratings or reviews websites and you'll find something with a great score. This was just so-so."
1,Metroid Prime 3 Corruption Review: Wii,"The game totally sucks. It is way too difficult in an absurd sense. I mean the puzzles are really mindless sometimes. Example: There will be a small piece of rock lying in some corner that you need to blast to find your way out.Now how on earth can you figure that out apart from hit and trial and missing it out several times.I gave up the game then found out this link: http://www.nextgenwalkthroughs.com/systems/wii/metroid3/index.phpwhich has a complete walk through of the game, so continued playing but then gave up again as it was not as much fun.I have played RE4 for several hours and it was just awesome, the puzzles lent special life to the game. These puzzles are just mindless."
3,OK Game,"The gameplay is a bit repetitive, and it feels like they were really stretching to have the Wiimote play an integral role in the game at times. That being said, I think the game was good overall, and some of the new game mechanics were pretty neat."
2,It's good...until the power cell searching,"This is good...up until they want you to do item searching. Picture this, you're ready to face the final boss, then you are told you need to back track to all the levels to find items. Yay! you have no idea where the items are and can only go to unexplored areas. I find this kind of task in games tedious and boring. Yep, I returned it after hours of hunting and pecking for power cubes."
4,Highly recommended,"Fans of metroid or just first person shooters in general wont be let down by this title. The Wii controls are smooth and easy to pick up, and the gameplay is very fun. The visuals are impressive, probably the best looking Wii game to date. The only reason I gave it a 4/5 star rating was because I found some of the spots that you had to be in the ball form a bit annoying, but its not all that often and dosen't take much away from the gameplay. If you own a Wii, do yourself a favor and pick this up."
2,I seem to have outgrown overly-complicated shooter games,"I bought this after a number of very positive reviews. I decided it was worth $5 used as an experiment. I suppose if one really likes these sort of things it is just fine. I on the other hand had a hard time getting interested. Nothing ventured, nothing gained nor lost."
3,the weakest of the three,Now to start ive played all 3 prime games and by far this is the shortest of the three its like half as long as prime 1 and 2 which is why it lost a star and the controls but i get to that later. It also kinda breaks the isolation with alot of talking and NPC interaction at the beginning of the game. And it also kinda breaks the boss fights to because you meet almost all of them of at the very beginning it kinda ruins the surprise. now its not a bad game it just feels a little too different then the old prime games. Now to the controls i never liked the wii controls it would be nice to have support for the gamecube or the wii classic controller as well as the wiimote because well it kinda awkward to play with the wiimote. In the end the game is good but short and the controls are awkward but if you can get over it it will be a great experience.My suggestion is to play the first 2 then play this you will see why they are better.
4,Pretty good if this is your thing,"I have never seen some of those things available when I've done some scrounging, but the ideas to use them are pretty interesting. My favorite is the linen cabinet made from the shutter doors; you'd have to see it to understand what I mean. Having met a man who is into collecting, I thought we could use it, but so far, not. Thumb through it, see if it's for you."
4,nice not fabulous,is it worth the money??? probably not..... it is not a bad book.. but nothing exciting !!!... just go to the flea market and buy what u love.. and let your imagination run wild !!!!.... personally i think i can do better than martha !!!! tag sales and flea markets was nice to look at but no big whoop !!!
4,Information not hyperbole,"After wading through a wealth of new age and neo-pagan type pseudo-history books, this book was received with extra pleasure. A difficult read because it does deal with ancient Ireland from an archeological perspective, but worthwhile for anyone that is interested in life before the Celts. No gushing about how wonderful life was or how we should try to get back to the way our ancestors lived, the authors keep speculation to a minimum and focus on what is actually known. As a practicing druid, let me assure you that enough junk has been written about Ireland with nothing to back it up except other Llewellyn books! Actual information is hard to come by, this book is the best I've read (OK, it's the only pre-Celtic I've read)"
4,About as good as it could be.,"There are some who would call their self-titled album their ""best of"", and while it is a great album, this is a good collection too. The first five tracks here are from that album, and are well chosen. Then a couple from ""Hallowed Ground"", and a couple from ""Blind Leading The Naked"". From ""3"" we get only ""Nightmares"". I personally love that album and still think it's underrated. Toss on ""American Music"", ""Color Me Once"" from ""The Crow"" soundtrack, and a few more of their later songs and this is a fine overview of the Violent Femmes career. If this also included ""Prove My Love"" and ""World We're Living In"" I'd have no complaints. Still, this is most of the best."
5,Excellent Family Movie,"Looking for a movie for the entire family? Every Second Counts details the importance of families hanging in there, even when times are tough. It teaches the lesson that choices do have consequences...and they do make a difference. I would highly recommend this movie as it had no foul language and no objectional material - truly a rarity in today's movie world.Reviewed by Penny Zeller, author of the historical romance novel ""McKenzie."""
4,Competitive horse movie,This is a good all around movie for the family. It does make the dad out to be someone who makes poor decisions and is wreckless in money handling and holding down a job. I did enjoy watching it. Is a clean movie.
4,Every second counts,"loving horses as I do, I found this a great family film, with the added interest of actorStephen Collins remembered from the series "" 7th.Heaven "" which I am watching repeats at present..Thankyou Amazon for bringing such pleasure to my day. delivery up to date as promised."
5,Movie,"This was a great, clean and touching family movie. Horses, relationships and life are tied into this film. Would recommend this for anybody who loves horses."
3,Dvd,Price and service excellent. Storyline had a little more drama than I wanted.I was hoping for a light happy story.
3,Every Second Counts,"Very good movie. It wasn't exactly what I thought it would be, but I did enjoy it. I do look forward to seeing it gain. It was a bit slower than I would have thought. But it was good."
4,Tom and Liz - together again?,"I thought this was a pretty good book. The fight between Tom and Elizabeth shoots up to its max when Tom hears that Elizabeth is leaving SVU to go to Denver with her boyfriend, Scott. It seems that everything is going to work out with them when Jessica impersonates Liz and makes out with Tom. The only problem is that Elizabeth catches them kissing and runs away from the goodbye party Jessica made for her, no longer debating whether or not to leave SVU, but intent on leaving. There's some fighting between Elizabeth and Jessica and then they make up, and then they start fighting again. It's like a never-ending cycle..."
3,Is this a bad soap opera or WHAT??!!,"Look, Francine. You need to do the following to SVU: Give Jessica a brain!! Does this girl EVER think?? I know that she was trying to help her sister and everything, but kissing Tom?? Give Tom a brain, too. He misses Elizabeth so much that he couldn't really tell if it was Elizabeth or Jessica. Get rid of Scott and Dana. I'm sick of them manipulating Tom and Liz so much!! Please let Tom and Liz find out the truth about their respective mates!!! I'm tired of this storyline, but I will buy the next book when Wal-Mart has them out!!"
4,Vise Grip works,"It works like most any other Vise Grip. The handle is comfortable. Problem is that I have had to keep adjusting the knob as I use it. And sometimes it is difficult to open up the Vise Grip. Especially as you are working on anything oily, like a car. Still without it, some jobs are near impossible."
5,"""It's All In the Game"" - What Emotion","Engelbert conveys so much emotion in his renditions on this great new CD! I appreciate Engelbert's dedication by going back into studio and doing the new studio cuts on several songs to make them special for us here in the United States. They all sound better than ever! The new songs on this CD - Its All In the Game, Hopelessly, Maybe The Feeling Will Go, Blame It On The Night and Dancing In the Rain are a special gift to us. Thanks Engelbert - I'm excited and happy for you, much success on this great CD!"
2,Very Disappointed,"... [F]or the amount of money I figured these templates would be more than basic.Your milage may very with this product but, like others here, I was dissapointed to find these dreamweaver templates similar to each other and very basic in design and look. These templates might be good for someone that wants to put something up quickly and isn't familar with HTML. The glowing editorial reviews and high cost might lead you to think there's more to this CD that what you will actually get. I felt very disappointed and a bit ripped off."
4,Great,"This is kind of lame rating batteries, but they do a fine job. I only took away a star because I think the prices they get for 9 volts are just absurd. But thankfully they last a while so you're not switching them out every 5 minutes like AAA."
3,overall a good movie,"I watched this after seeing it listed as the ""movie of the day"" on the internet movie database. It turned out to be a really good movie, although parts of it were so stupid that I couldn't help but laugh. It had a pretty decent acting and a good plot and soundtrack wasn't that bad either! If you liked this one you may also want to check out a movie called The Emerald Forest. Overall it was a good movie and worth watching."
2,Uncommon Valor,"Uncommon Valor is an average film whose highlight is Gene Hackman's performance. Fans of Hackman or those looking for a decent action film about the Vietnam War should consider Uncommon Valor as a rental, as the MSRP of $29.95 seems unreasonably high for what you actually get. 2 stars."
5,Minor Correction,"An excellent movie and great acting by all involved. Just to get the names right, it wasn't Patrick Swazy as reported in an earlier review, but rather David Keith."
1,One of the bad movies about Vietnam war.,"I think some people like this film because it's about American soldiers listed as missing in action but they're believed still alive.I can ignore a lot of logical holes in this picture but there are things I can't ignore. Below is the listing of those.The hand-to-hand fighting scenes look outrageously fake.The acting of everybody except Gene Hackman is wooden.There's only one good scene. It's when in his dream, Gene Hackman saw his son, at that time, he was just a small kid asking his Dad ""Can I sleep with you tonight?"". When Gene woke up, he realized his son was now listed as missing in action in Vietnam.There only two films on my list of Best Vietnam War movies. They're ""We were soldiers"" and ""Hamburger Hill""."
3,It was kinda boring and immature acting,"This book got so boring I stopped halfway through. I give it at least 3 stars though because some of it was good but they wrote the saem things in EVERY letter it seemed and I like action books. I suggest trying to read it but don't be too dissapoionted if it's not exactly as you thought. The girls act younger than in junior high. Like 3rd or 4th graders writing letters back and forth. Overall it was ""ok"""
2,Just couldn't sink in,"I read the sequel to this book (Snail Mail No More), and I loved it. I'd thought I would read this one also. I really didn't like it. There was something about this book I guess I didn't like or couldn't understand something. This book just wasn't really for me. I loved Snail Mail No More! Maybe you might like it much better too."
5,P.S Longer Letter Later,"I'm telling you in my opinion this is one of the best books I have ever read. I usually just read the first couple of pages but with this book I read it the whole way through.Tara*starr and Elizabeth are BFFers, but when Tara finds out she is moving to Ohio, things change. Elizabeth's dad has drinking problems and leaves the family while they move into an apartment. Tara's mom is pregnant with a girl."
4,P.S. Longer Letters Later,"I think it is a good book. It is about two girls who were best friends but then one of the girls move. They have to learn that they can communicate by writing letters and talking on the phone.I am sorry for Elizabeth because she goes from rich to poor and also, her father leaves them. It is a good book and I would like people to read it."
5,Great book ---- I couldn't put it down!!,"I loved this book. When I read the flap, I knew it sounded good, I just didn't know how good. After I read the first 20 pages or so, I knew I just HAD to read the sequel (Snail Mail No More). Learning about other girls' problems and finding out how they dealt with them made me feel good, and it gave me confidence because there are a lot of girls out there who are dealing with these problems right now. This book shows how true friends even though they have a few fights stay loyal. Other friends and boyfriends can't come between two best friends. It shows you how your friends really need you to be there for them even on their toughest days. Once you start this book, you won't be able to put it down!"
5,What an amazing book...,"This has got to be one of my favorite books that I have ever read. In this story, Elizabeth's best friend Tara*Star moves away, they keep in contact with letters. As Tara's life suddenly becomes better than ever before, Elizabeth's once perfect life starts to fall to pieces. The two girls support each other in this heart warming story. This is a book to read if you love friends, life, and letters. I highly recommend this book."
3,Pretty good,"Well, the book did keep me entertained yet I couldn't realate to any of the charaters problems and all they did was complain. Since the athors are not teens it sounded wrong and there ideas on how teens act are off base, the way the charaters talked sounded like adults trying to talk like there children. Plus the girls on the cover looked no older then 10 (and the characters acted 10). One obsesed over her recent developments the other complained about not knowing anything and didnt ask untill the end of the book. It's still entertaining to read and see teens as adults see teens and funny to laugh at the annoying whiny charaters."
3,Polar opposite best friends become pen friends,"What attracted nice, sweet Elizabeth to become friends with mouthy, bossy Tara (I refuse to add the ""*Starr"" as it is over-the-top pretentious) in the first place? Was she that desperate for a friend? It's possible. However, the reader never finds out how their friendship began and on what basis. All we know is they were best friends, and then Tara had to move away.I loved the way Elizabeth was so mature and strong for her age, and faced her family problems very bravely. And I also liked seeing her stand up to Tara's snotty, judgmental, braggy tone in her letters.Overall I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this book to anyone in any age group; there are so many better reading choices out there."
1,This book SUCKS!!!!!,"This is a HORRIBLE book. I cannot imagine how, out of 106 reviews, absolutely no one gave it one-star! The characters are unimaginative and flat, and they are completely unbelievable!! I found myself being like ""who cares?"" throughout the entire thing. This book reads like it was written by a couple of eight-year olds, and whenever they run out of ideas, they just decide to have their characters get in a fight. And when Tara*Starr and Elizabeth fight, they basically just write ""I don't want to be friends any more, so good-bye poophead"". Oooh, how realistic!! And how mature for 6TH GRADERS!!! I mean, hellooooo? So, in conclusion, if you are over five years old DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!"
2,BORING!,"SORRY BUT THIS WAS DOUBLE BORING!I FINISHED IT IN 3 HOURS WHICH IS ALONG TIME BECAUSE I CAN USUALLY FINISH IN 2!tHIS IS ABOUT TWO GIRLS WHO WRITE LETTERS TO EACHOTHER AND BRAG, MAKE EACHOTHER MAD AND THEN ACT SO STUPID. AND THEY DONT EVEN HAVE A GOOD MESSAGE. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 2 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE IS BECAUSE I ACTRUALLY FINISHED IT WITHOUT DIEING OF BOREDOM OR FALING ASLEEP.TRUST ME! tHE GIRLS IN THIS BOOK ARE IN LIKE MIDDLE SCHOOL BUT THEY ACT LIKE THEY ARE IN 3RD GRADE. ITS BADDDDD!"
5,"I'm the girls' age, and I can relate to this book!","When I got this book for my birthday, I knew that it was going to be interesting from the first time I saw it! At first,when I started reading it, I thought that it was going to be the same as any other book I have ever read. But, as I got into it, I realized that I was totally mistaken! This book is something I can relate to, because my friend recently moved away. From experience, I can tell you that the authors pinpointed exactly how I felt when my she moved away. I'm really glad that these two wonderful authors teamed up to write this wonderful book, and I hope that they write another book just as interesting. As you can tell, I was very pleased with this book!"
5,Incredible,"This book was so good. I recommend it to anyone. When I first began reading it, I didn't really like it. But then, when I started reading again, I couldn't put it down! But that shouldn't have surprised me. Ann M. Martin is my favorite author, and I love Paula Danziger's Amber Brown series. Of course when they combine their talents, the book is going to be great! Please read this. You won't regret it!"
4,really good book,this is a great book for 11-13 year olds. it is good cuz they can relate to some of the things the girls in the book are dealing with. it is realistic fiction and i really enjoyed reading it!!
5,A perfect Book!,P.S longer letter later is a fantastic book about two best friends who are trying to keep their friendship alive with letters and dealing with tough times that they have to deal with alone and the only conact they have iss through letters they cant even talk on the phone together
4,A great story about friendship,"In the book P.S. Longer Letter Later by Paula Danziger there are two girls who are best friends who always know what they are going to wear the next day. Then in the summer Elizabeth has to move. Tara is very mad. Elizabeth is mad too, but now they can't even see each other. so they decide to write to each other. The book tells all about the two girls trying to keep their friendship even though they are seperated and go through horrible situations with their families. I liked the idea of having them write to each other in letters. It is also really cool for them to still be best buds even though Elizabeth moved."
5,This book was such a good book.,Do you have a best friend?Well this is the book for you.2 girls best friends. Tara*Starr and Elizabeth are best friends.Tara*Starr moves away uh oh big fight. How will there friendship stay?If they can't see eachother then they'll have to call right no. I guess that only leaves 1 option write.Thats o.k..They love wrting.
4,Two Different Best Friends,"Every girl will discover a bit of herself in either Tara*Starr or Elizabeth, the correspondents in Longer Letter Later. The two girls are totally different. Tara*Starr is outgoing and loves to be in the center of attention. Elizabeth is quiet, shy and thoughtful. Tara*Starr has two parents who don't act grown up. Elizabeth lives in a household where feelings kept private. Needless to say, these two different girls are best friends.Then Tara*Starr's family moves to Ohio and letter writing is the only way to continue their friendship. But changes are taking place in the lives of both girls. Tara*Starr's parents are becoming more responsible, and Elizabeth's father has been fired and is suffering from alcoholism. Will their differences bring them together, or pull them farther apart?The exchange of letter reveal the lifestyles and thoughts of these two in a lively, engaging way. I was drawn to both these girls and the friendship which distance cannot break."
4,A novel through letters,"Tara*Starr and Elizabeth are two completely different girls, who are best friends. Tara*Starr likes to have all eyes on her, while Elizabeth is shy and quiet, and tries to blend in with everyone else.Tara*Starr moves to Ohio and leaves Elizabeth to start 7th grade on her own. Tara*Starr feels that her charents (parents who still act like children) are acting much more responsible than they ever have, and are now talking about having a baby. While Elizabeth's family is breaking apart. Her father has a drinking problem, and spends money that he doesn't have, which is causing the family to go into debt. He eventually leaves Elizabeth (and her mom and younger sister Emma), and decides to get a separation. The strange thing is, is that Elizabeth is glad that he's left.This is an excellent book that follows the lives of two girls as they go through new friends, boyfriends, and family problems. But everything always works out for the best."
5,Best Book Ever!,"This book was very hard for me to put down. I got it in August of 2005 and have read it many times. The first day I got it, I read it within one hour. It is about two twelve year old girls- Tara*Starr and Elizabeth. Tara*Starr is a fun girl who loves to wear lots of accessories. Elizabeth is kind of laid-back and doesn't quite wear as vibrant clothes or accessories. When Tara moves, all they can do is write eachother. It really teaches you that even if you don't see someone hardly in the year, you can still be best friends. My best friend moved away this summer and I sent her the book to read. Once she was done, we started writing eachother letters just like in the book. I highly recommend it."
2,Chair is not deep enough to sit comfortably and too low,"Chair sit is 6 inches and table is 12 inches high. Chair sit is very narrow. My son is 18 months old, normal height and it is too short for him even now. When he sits on the chair, his knees are higher than his bottom.It is nicely made, but I will have to buy another table and chair pretty soon. If it is too short for 1.5 years old, it is definitely too short for the recommended 2-3 year old."
4,customer service?,"I've been looking for a table this size since our son was 9 months old. We finally found this table just after his first birthday. We ordered it for him to eat his meals at instead of strapping him into a high chair. It was very easy to put together, you only have to screw the legs in. But we noticed a significant chip on the top edge of the table and wanted to exchange it for a new one. I've emailed twice with absolutely no response. Kind of disappointing. Beside that we all love it especially our now 14 month old. He loves to sit in the chair and pull the table in for himself. It has helped with his independence and confidence. It's the perfect size (he's 24 lbs.) We hope he will also like to use it some time in the future for coloring or other small art projects."
2,Not What I Expected,This movie was very disappointing. I bought it based on watching the action pre-views. The action pre-view is the only good part in this movie.
3,EH.......,"TO BE HONEST, I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE FOR ONE OF THE LAMEST AND YET MOST OVERUSED REASONS....BECAUSE THE COVER WAS A COOL VISUAL COMBINATION OF JAWS AND PIRANHA THAT CRIED OUT....BUY ME!ALAS, AS THE SAYING GOES, WE MUST NEVER JUDGE A BOOK (DVD) BY IT'S COVER BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THIS IS A COMPETENT FILM, THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY IT'S HIGHLIGHT. ALTHOUGH IT TRIES TO BE SCARY AND ONE SCENE WHERE SOMEONE'S HEAD IS BITTEN OFF IS REALLY COOL, THIS MOVIE DOESN'T EVER TRANSCEND THE CLICHES NOR IT'S MEDIOCRITY AND THUS ULTIMATELY IN MY VIEW THIS FILM IS FUN BUT FORGETTABLE."
1,Perfect Storm meets Jaws meets Predator and bad CGI,"Perfect Storm meets Jaws meets Predator. I watched this movie on SyFy last night. I will admit that I like B horror movies involving animals, creatures, dinosaurs and monsters. But SyFy needs to find some originality. I mean come on...! The Ben character was a complete rip off of Quint right down to the drinking, the sideburns, that mustache and the quint cap! The Predator connection is even worse. This movie is a comedy parody of better movies at best. The ending is Aliens copy too...I much preferred the movie on SyFy that came after it...Eye of The Beast...not too bad of acting and cresture effects without the bad CGI...not too bad for a Giant Squid movie...."
2,Not great,"I don't feel like complaining about Christmas presents, so I'll keep this short.The characters are generic, but would be alright. Except for something impotent... er, important. The pacing is off because many people die within the first half, leaving very few to continue the story. They're not terribly interesting and so aren't enough to support the film's weight. Whenever the creatures aren't onscreen the second half gets boring."
3,Not too bad,I was really not expecting much out of this movie. But to be honest it is not anywhere as bad as others in the maneater series. I did not mind it too bad.
2,not his best,"While, in my opinion, Mark Hummel is among the best harmonicaplayers around the world, this cd is solid, but brings nothing new... The main reason for that, in my view, is that the guitarplayers on this cd are in no way renewing...they play solidly traditional style but that's all, while on other cd's Hummel is playing with guys like Junior Watson and Rusty Zinn... for beginning harmonicaplayers it is a good cd to start with... other people who want to buy a Hummel-cd: buy 'Hard Lovin' 90's', 'Lowdown to Uptown' or 'Married to the blues'.... ...a blues fan and harmonica/guitar-player from Eindhoven."
4,Quality ideas about Christian integrity,"I think this books has a lot of good ideas, though in my opinion was a little lacking in assisting someone in applying to his life.Good strong message on Christian integrity. Very readable book."
1,Absurd.,The gentlemen in this book have someone follow them around and refuse to allow themselves any contact with women because they feel they cannot trust themselves not to act like animals.I think that's really all that needs to be said about this book.
4,Life in China,"A collection of well written stories telling about everyday life in China in the 1980s. The people described are touching, you wish to know more about them and how they cope with their lives. The book gives you a view of Chinese culture and way of thinking and it serves as a good introduction to contemporary Chinese literature."
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Give me any of the musicals anytime. These performances are like a thing in the past. Some of these production companies should take a look at the old to bring back the Glitz!!!!!!!!!!!
2,McClain and musical yantras,"The book as a whole basically makes no sense, since as scholarship it is pretty much completely lacking. However, lurking between the covers is an interesting and orginal idea for constructing scales, which McClain calls a ""yantra"". A yantra consists of all positive integers below a certain limiting value, which factor into primes only up to a given prime, or ""prime limit"". For instance, we can take all numbers less than a trillion which are products of 2, 3 and 5. We then reduce this to an octave, and obtain a scale.McClain argues that this method of scale construction was known to the ancients, who secretly encoded it in various texts. This is claim is not only unsupported by his arguments, it is historically impossible."
5,great Product - worked as advertised,"This is the perfect product for OEM and aftermarket intake manifolds, adds just the right look to a rebuild and works like a charm."
3,"Bent, sketchy welds","This is pretty much what you'd expect, though I was only lifting an iron intake manifold, not a complete engine. There are three short tack welds on each side of the upright, and I'd feel better if they spent the extra two cents to fully weld it. In fact my brother took his in to be welded up before attempting to lift a big-block with (I'm sure it'd hold, but not sure enough to bet with my fingers under it.)Mine was also crooked (the upright was at about an 80 degree angle) but I was able to beat it into place."
2,Too big...,"Texture and shape are nice, but it was way to big for my lady friends, one of whom has had two children. Suction cup holds well to smooth surfaces. Both vibrators and controllers works great."
1,This is what you call a playset?,"I am 12 years old and i love Van Helsing but some of your figures and this playset are nothing but junk!This castel along with the Wolfman figure are made from cheap,junky rubber and plastic! There is nothing fun about this ""playset""! There are no places to play with the figures, only this one room. Why can't there be chambers and other towers to go into not just this one lousy room? I bought this thing and the roof broke the day that i got it!! And the smaller playsets with figures(Van helsing with grappling hook playset& Frankenstine with light up tower) Don't even stay in place.The light up tower dose not even fit were it's to go!!!!I think that Jakks Pacific Inc. should make a new castel with tower to go into,atleast two or more rooms, amd secret camders or some thig, SOMTHING NEW and FUN to play with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,kind of cool,"this castle is alright. it's not as bad as some people say. all you have to do is use your imagination and get some figures! but, like alot of people say it is a big piece of plastic"
1,Avery Binder,"These binders arrived in a terrible shape. Some were torn at the seams, others had the plastic separating in places. Overall not the best binders I have ever used. I would not recommend these to anyone for the price."
2,Best character: the worms,"Todd loves worms. He collects them, experiments with them and uses them to scare his sister and her friend. One day he cuts a worm in two and the reaction he thinks he sees in the rest of the worms makes him wonder if they saw it. When worms start showing up in unexpected places, like in his cap and in his meals, he begins to fear that the worms take revenge for the way he acted.I didn't enjoy this book. Todd is an utterly unlikable main character, both in regards to his behaviour towards the helpless animals and his surroundings. I need to able to root for the protagonist in a book, and Todd could not awaken my sympathy at all.Furthermore, the story was no more than okay, there never was any explanation of the thing the big bird scared away, and the end was very sudden and threw in a new component altogether."
2,not the best!!!,"To me this book was a huge dissapointment. First of all i thought this book would be a little more scary than todd just finding worms in all his stuff and then the thing that happens at the end, which by the way I found a little lame. This book was a huge let down.I know that Mr.Stine can right way better books than this one.If your looking for a good goosebumps to read, read a good goosebumps like the curse of camp cold lake, but don't waste your money on this book. I'm glad that all the other goosebumps books are fabulous and great, because this one just didn't work out for me. I think that if Stine wanted to write a book about worms he could have had a scarier story than just worms showing up everywhere. I wouldn't give this book a one because it wasn't like the worst book in the world, it just wasn't too good.Don't read this book, if your looking for an awesome and spectacular goosebumps."
3,Go Eat Worms,"My book is Go Eat Worms, By: R.L Stine. Go Eat Worms is about a boy who does something really bad to a worm and now the other worms want revenge.there are 4 caricatures in this story my fav. Are Danny and Peter. They're my fav. Because they are always playing jokes. The other 2 are Regina and Beth; they are OK because they scared peter with very bad joke. The them of my book is don't do what your going to regret because peter was doing stuff bad and it finally caught up with him. My fav. Part was when he wanted to take a bath. I liked the ending because it was not sad or happy ending but it was a scary ending.I did not like the author's style because it was just a plan written book. The author does give enough details. I think the age should be 7-13 because it is a rather easy book. I would not recommend it for 6 year olds because they might get nightmares."
2,GO EAT WORMS!,yuck! well it a soo borin book sry but i h8 worms n gross stuff like dat jus wasted my money n time readin that buk but realli if ya lyk worms i fink u will like it
4,this book is about a boy that likes worms.,"One day a boy named,Todd, cuts a worm in half just trying too impress his sister. All of a sudden the worms seem to be looking at him. then the worms start appear in the worst places,in his ceral, hat, bed, shower, book bag, and the worst of all his food. Todd has to find out who or what is doing this.Find out by reading this great book ""go eat worms"""
4,A little expensive for what you get,"This is not a bad travel guide. It's very pretty, which is really what you are paying for. The book spends too much time on the arts and museums and not enough on ""what to do."" However the maps are great and the organization makes it quite clear. Good buy if you are using it for ALL of California."
1,Misguiding?,"I went to visit 6 Flags Marine World in Vallejo, CA. When I arrived there I found to my surprise that it was closed for no special reason. The opening times in the book are wrong! Then I decided to visit Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. I was late for the last boat at 2:15 PM. In the book says the last one is at 2:45 PM... Wrong again!! Now, I have a book but I still have to call to ask and confirm any move I do. If it is not possible to be accurate with the opening/closing times, it is better not to say anything about them."
3,Not a bad book,"I already have 5 other DK Eyewitness Travel guides, but this one is not my favorite. It tried to do too much. It has the most information about Los Angeles and San Francisco. Napa for example, got only 1 2-page spread!I wish they had included some walking tours for the big cities. The maps are not great.DK ET, is perhaps the best travel guide makers, so this book can't be that bad just because they made it. Also, at over 600 pages, it's a rather large travel guide, yet it's not bulky for carrying."
3,"good for LA and San Francisco, not helpful about other places","This is a book to buy if you only want to go to LA and San Francisco, a lot of details about these two cities. But I am sure there are books specifically wrote for these 2, so why not go for those? This book covers very little on the scenic places such as CA coast line, several national parks, and Sierra. Not recommended!"
4,nice complete book,"This is a great book to own about California. I wish there had been more complete maps, but I purchased an atlas and that helped. I was mostly in Southern California, and so I didn't get much into the large section on San Francisco bay, but next time I go, I'll have a nice resource. I like the pictures and the writing and the information, I'd recommend it."
3,Few information about each place,"This is a guidebook to check on spot, when you are facing the touristic site and you want to have more information about it. But it does not carry comprehensive or critical information about each place, so it is not really helpful when you are still planning where to go. It is quite a traditional guidebook, with numbers, dates and famous events connected to each destination, but it lacks some useful travel tips. Overall, it is just an OK book."
1,Poorly done,"The disc promises to use the original arrangements, but instead uses chessey sounding orchestrations. Some numbers don't even have an orchestration. It is just someone plunking out the piano part. The tempi are much too slow. Overall, a disappointment - not worth the $30 bucks I spent."
2,"It looks like a guitar, sounds like a...","It arived safely (packed so well it would probably survive a plane crash) but the strings were very coroded. The tuners are decent (for a very inexpensive guitar) but once tuned all cords sounded off key. Not playable if you can hear. However if deaf it might be quite fun. The plastic fingerboard, painted binding, and plastic bridge are disapointing, but when this guitar makes it to my chop shop, the bridge pins and tuners might be usefull on another gutar. If you buy it for a child, you won't have to wory about teaching them how to tune. It will make little difference."
2,Poor fret calculation,"I bought this guitar for my little girl knowing it was a low end instrument. I do not have a complaint about the materials or fit/finish. I knew what I was getting. The problem I have with this guitar is that the fret calculations used were off, so that the guitar does not fret accurately. For example, I can tune it up, and it holds a tune for a while. If I fret a D on the B string, it is not a D. This makes the instrument o.k. for play time, but not very good for learning basics of guitar."
4,guitar,"good product, the strings kind of hurt a little the tip of your fingers if you play too long but it's a great buy and affordable for young kids who just start their classes."
1,Not their best work,"Dean makes some very good budget guitars. This is not one of them. The fret ends are sharp, and the intonation is bad. The action is a mile high. NOT a good instrument for a young beginner -- spend more on another instrument."
3,Dean Playmate Product Review,"The Dean Playmate 1/2 size guitar is for children from 5 to 8 years of age that are interested in learning how to play the guitar. Other viewers say that it's more than a toy, and that's somewhat true. You should buy this instrument, with the intent of having your child learn how to play the guitar. It has normal tuning pegs, and acoustic guitar bridge pins, just like a any other acoustic guitar.For a $45.00 guitar, we know that Dean isn't gonna put a lot of time, and detail into this instrument, with that being said, my only complaint is that the action is a little high for a beginner. Maybe the extremely light strings will makeup for that. On the other hand the strings will break rather easily, so make sure your child doesn't over turn the tuning pegs, or the strings will break."
2,Toy Guitar,This is a toy guitar built with real guitar parts. It cannot be properly tuned since it's not made to be played. It is great for kids that want to look cool and make some noise. Tone deaf kids and adults will love it for its cool looks.
5,Saved the cost of a course and picked it up fast!,"I was going to take a course to learn powerpoint, but the times were all wrong for me, so I ordered this nifty book and with its help put together my first powerpoint lecture with an outline and graphics. It was a big hit with the audience and was easy to do. I think this book is terrific - and 2003 was fine for me - I still have Windows XP. Did this in May 2008."
1,Straitline Laser Tape,"I'm glad I didn't buy a Straitline Laser Tape. The clerk in the tool dept. at Home depot tested it in my presence. No measurement was correct. And no measurement was the same when scanned twice.Was this product successfully tested before marketing? I am not impressed with this company.Sincerely, Tom Grandia"
1,Junky light show,"Received it as a gift. The concept seems good, but even after frequent calibrations, it rarely got the same results twice. It just produced a meaningless mini-light shows.It seems odd that this product gets either a 5 or a 1 with the majority being 1. I suspect the reviews have been salted. Do not buy it unless you are giving it as a prank gift."
1,Awful- Lame - junk - schlock - P.O.S - ugh,"---I ended up smashing this thing with a hammer--It needed to be put out of my misery.>Another fine product from crapco where quality is just a word<I bought it to see if it would work better then the basic zircron I had. Well if completely arbitrary readings are what you want, this is your unit. A roll of wet toilet paper would work as well, and not have the annoying high pitched beeping.man was this thing bad.No ,really it was no good at allseriously, it was junk"
1,WARNING DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,Biggest piece of junk I have ever bought. It could not find studs properly. I trusted it and now have a whole in my wall that I have to pay someone to come and fix!!!!! It said there were two studs within 16 inches apart. I was putting up a wall niche and needed to cut out between them. IT WAS SO WRONG!!!!! It couldn't tell there was a stud in the middle at the 8 inch mark!!!! I could have done better throwing darts at the wall and going by were they landed!!!!.Please do not buy this.
1,get something else for the same money,"Bought this model - didn't work. Reread the instructions 3 times and tried many different surfaces - would never calibrate - always just kept beepingBought the Zircon Studsensor Pro SL AC for the same price (within a buck or so) - worked right out of the package. I also liked that you could switch the Zircon from 3/4"" to 1 1/2"" depth. These units say they detect live AC electric lines - but you'd be a fool to trust it IMHO - make sure the circuit is dead."
1,Total Junk,"Deserves zero stars. I received one as a gift. Worked fine the first day out of the box, but the next day it went nuts -- every inch of my wall had a stud under it according to the finder -- and hasn't worked since. I'm just glad I didn't waste my own money on it."
1,Don't bother!,I received this as a gift and it has never worked correctly. It never calibrated and hence was useless. Save your money.
1,Absolute piece of junk!,"This tool is supposed to do just one job: find studs in your wall.It simply does not work....at all.Do not buy this item, it's a joke."
4,strong debu,The better life is a great debut from 3 doors down. I head the song kryptonite and got the album. I was pleasantly suprised by listening to better life because they're a lot more talented then I thought. I thought that they would definetely will not be a one hit wonder. Of course now we know that because of songs like be like that. I'm just waiting for a new album by these guys hoping it will be as good.
2,Excellent neo-grunge album,"The people who say 3DD is a one-hit wonder obviously don't know much about the rest of their music. This is a great post-grunge CD without a single poor song. The energy and flow of this album is incredible; the album really never seems to get bogged down and all the songs flow swiftly through and on to the next. The guitar is pretty good, and Brad Arnold's vocals are solid. My favorites are ""By My Side,"" ""Kryptonite,"" ""Not Enough,"" ""Be Like That"" (which proves 3DD can do pretty songs too) ""So I Need You,"" ""Life of My Own,"" oh heck, just about all of them except ""Down Poison"" and ""Smack,"" which aren't quite on the same level. The Better Life is characterized by a gritty agressive attack and well-channeled energy; a must-have for fans of mainstream and post-grunge rock."
3,Cool album. I like 3 songs on it.,"The reason I give this album 3 stars is because it has three songs it that I like ""Kryptonite"", ""Loser"" and ""Be Like That"" the rest of the album is dull, but I like those three songs. Later."
3,Kids are Alright!,"Sort of reminds me of Gin Blossomes, and Matchbox 20,better than anything Red Hot Chilli Peppers could do orPearl Jam or Nirvana junk.Decent for a debut, it`s listenable compared to most new garage bands, who want to be headliners, that just whine, or are just plain angry, can`t play their instruments, or look foolish."
4,A good overall album.,I do not like Creed but I do like this band. I just got this cd earlier today and it was better than I thought it would be. Certainly better than anything Creed has ever done. My favorite track has to Kryptonite.
3,'clasic' 3 Doors Down,"I don't listen to this much any more, it used to be a big favorite of mine six years ago, my tastes have changed since then, but that does not stop me from recommending this as 3 Doors Down's best CD.but, what! Why three stars?Well, sir (or miss) it is one track that has the singular distinction of knocking off at lest one star off my review.and that track is... 'be like that', a song so monumentally awful that it made me cringe when I first heard it, with that memorable first line: ""He spends his nights in Calliiforniiaaaa..."" OH GOD, MAKE IT STOP!Brad Arnold has a voice that fits the rest of this album, except, 'be like that' it's so flat and lifeless there. Sad because the words have some meaning.Now that that is out of my system, a song I really thought was a real stand out is 'so I need you' highly underrated, it has all the thoughtfulness of 'be like that' but in a sound that fits Brad's voice.That being said this is a CD worth being in your collection."
5,These Guys Have A Future...,"3 doors down sounds like a great group! I got the cd hearing their two singles, ""Kryptonite"" and ""Loser"", but there are more good songs too. Loser is by far my favorite, and then i like kryptonite, life of my own, duck and run, and be my side. The other songs are okay, but they won't be the ones I listen to often. They got a great future, as long as they dont sell out to those MTV groupies..."
5,Good ole hard rock n' roll not alternative.,It's great to see a rock bank like this enjoying some goodchart sucess. Currently there are 27 on billboard and have spent 49weeks on the chart. Never mind the charts heres why this is a greatCD. The songs are all good from start to finish.Well I don't likeloser that much because I think It's a bunch of whining but I like thetune. What I love about this group is that they rock. Lots of greatpower chords and hooks dominate this disc. ... So all you rock fanboyband haters get this because its kick ...!
5,"3 DOORS DOWN ARE THE REAL SUPERMEN, THIS ALBUM WAS AMAZING","all i can say is that if you want a cd with unbelievable tracks then this is the album for you. brad arnold is amazing as lead vocalist and drummer. he is for sure a future star if not one already. i purchased this album just for the song kryptonite and was overwhelmed by the rest of the tracks on this album. from kryptonite to duck and run, this album is going to be considered a classic in future years. this band has a very promising career ahead of them. keep it up 3DD!"
4,try 'em,"Ok, so maybe ""Kyriptonite"" was way over-played, and you're probably thinking, 3 Doors Down? No way! But seriously, this cd is great. The feelings explained in the songs are so true-to-life. The cd picks me up. Give it a try."
3,"A good CD, but not great","I have had this CD for well over a year now and this band has never really impressed me much. Granted their are a few great songs on the CD (none of which get radio play). Its just a shame to me that 3 Doors Down are getting very popular and other great bands are getting looked over.My biggest comlaint with 3DD is the lyrics. What is this guy singing about? Songs like ""Kryptonite"" confuse me because the lyrics make no sense at all. ""Ill keep you by my side with my superhuman mind...."" WHAT???? I dont get it at all. And the hugely popular song ""Loser"" has been done by 50 other bands before (most notedly Beck's Loser from a few years back).Im not completely bashing this band because they still get 3 stars. I think that this album is a good start. But it really makes no sense to me how they have gotten so popular. I have trouble identifying with the lyrics and mediocre guitar riffs. Get the two great albums by Oleander before you get this one."
4,Can i call it soft grunge?...,"... or maybe the late nineties grunge?! 'cause they surely sound like grunge, but a more melodic, easy-listening one! There are very good songs in this album like ""kryptonite"", ""loser"", ""down poison"" and my favourite ""be like that"", the lyrics are good and i will listen to this cd very often! It's a 4+ album!!!"
2,Little variation between tracks,"This CD album is one that contains ""the hit single....and then all the other songs"". Kryptonite has a very catchy melody and has been receiving plenty of airplay. But the rest of the album is very disappointing. ""The other songs"" are remarkably similar to each other. They have very simplistic compositional constructions with minimal variation from one song to the other."
3,Ya..It's Rock But...,"I think this is a decent cd, but the lyrics are corny. I guess its real rock, but its not that great. Kryptonite will get old pretty fast. The music is satisfying, but shallow. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy this cd and I hope this band comes out with more albums. If you want to listen to a hard rock band with a great debut cd, pick up Appetite for Destruction by Guns N Roses."
1,not as advertised,I love 3 doors down. When I downloaded this c.d. it was not 'the better life'it was 'away from the sun' now I can't return it because its open but I can warn others. It came in 'the better life' case & the c.d. is also marked 'the better lfe' BUT IT'S NOT! I'm totally P.O.'d about this. Now I've bought the same c.d. 2x.
2,It's...alright,"I fell in love with ""Kryptonite"" nearly the moment i heard it..but once i got the CD, I was bummed to find that the other tracks on the album carried a rather depressing message..example, ""I am a Loser""...etc. The band does have talent, but until they can show it in more positive ways, you won't see me running out to buy their next cd. Hope this helped some of you who were debating whether or not to buy it...love to you all..God Bless."
3,Really Depressing!!,"All the songs are about suicide, death, & drugs.The entire CD is a downer!The guitar is flaming the entire album, but it's just way too depressing!!"
2,ok but could be better,"I enjoyed this cd but it could be bettter. For one thing, get rid of the swearing; it's unnessesary. Another thing that I didn't like about this cd is that it's not very positive. In some places it even gets somewhat offensive. Even if you liked the songs you heard on the radio, don't buy this cd. The radio songs are the only good songs on the cd."
3,It's one long song,"Sure 3 Doors Down has some good songs, but this album doesn't showcase them. Once I listened to it twice, all of the songs blended together into on long song. Every song has the same message, the same riff et cetera. Needless to say, buy the fourth track I was bored by the CD."
2,am I listening to a slow Anthrax here?,"OK, The Kryptonite hit was the song that would have made the albumn sell if it ever was going to, Down Poison comes next, and all the rest you can take your pick, execpt Loser, I simply can't take to it - lyrics?!? But not all is bad, I can put it in the car and sift through them for a while, production seems good, and as it's their first release, I will be hoping for more,Nice try though....Erik."
2,okay whatever!,Kryptonite is addictive. My friends and i really like it. It's always a plus that they're from our home state. I was sorta disappointed w/ the rest of the album though.
3,3 solid stars for a solid first effort,"I got this cd based on an interview of the guitarists in Guitar One magazine. I liked their attitudes and their description of themselves (an `80's rock band with modern alternative influences) sounded interesting. In the interview they never pretended to be anything but straight ahead guitar driven hard rock n' roll, so I didn't have any pretenses of angst-ridden poetry or the pioneers of a new musical style when I bought the cd. I wanted a hard rocker, and that's what I got. Obviously, with their straightforward approach to making music there's not going to be a whole lot of new ground covered, but they are a solid band with a talent for coming up with beefy riffs and catchy tunes. If you want to rock and not think too hard about it this cd's for you."
2,Disappointing,"On the strength of the song ""Kryptonite"" I bought this album, and wound up sadly disappointed. There's no doubt that ""Kryptonite"" is the strongest song on the album. While overall the musicianship is competent, none of the other tracks stand out. After awhile the songs all run together in a bland, forgettable mix. Too many start with a short acoustic into, followed by heavy guitar crunching, repeated ad nauseam. Luckily, I was able to sell the album to a co-worker and get my money back. Too bad, as I really wanted to like this album."
1,Temporary Pleasure,"Similar to other releases of 90's alt-rock bands Three Doors Down manages to sound competent while bringing absolutely nothing new to the table. If you want ""real"" lyrics, check out a more emotionally soaked band (like Alice in Chains). The music is temporarily pleasing then quickly becomes annoying while they plod out riff after riff with little to no variation between songs. The cd alternates between fast rocker to slow ballad so robotically that the cd screams ""predictable"".In short, the cd is good for about a month, until you either discover a new flavor of the month, or realize that they managed to pull off NOTHING original or special. A waste of money all around."
5,This CD rocks!!,"If you like rock then you'll definately like these guys. ""Kryptonite"" is one of the best songs this year and ""Loser"" is even better. A must-have."
4,What a rockin' album,"I agree with the above reviews. This album rocks! And we need more bands that still know what that means. I have to add, if you like this album and are a Creed or Godsmack fan you would absolutley love Doubledrive-the best rockin' band out there."
5,"A Great ""Live"" Listen as Well!","I am grateful that I had the opportunity to see 3 Doors Down, live in St. Pete FL, the day after the CD was released. They were even more powerful and dynamic live, and that was a little hard to believe after listening to the CD. Great rock-n roll guitar and phenominal drums with vocals that will blow your mind! A great buy for anyone who is a lover of rock music! I strongly recommend ""The Better Life"" for anyone who loves any kind of music!"
5,Awsome,"Simply put, tracks 1-8 are awsome. If you like rock, you will like this CD. My opinion, buy it!"
2,UGH,"Another boring album. shall I continue There is really only one song worth listening to that WON'T put you to sleep. Ok, so It's actually pretty hard to fall asleep with it on because it bores you to death.it was recommended to me by a friend and I regret spending money on it. Out of their two albums I only like 3 songs so it's easier to just buy singles.The quality of the songs was great , don't get me wrong, they have potential. It's the actual songs and combination of lyrics to music thats so bad.Maybe next time."
2,They wasted all their hooks on one song,"Yeah, ""Kryptonite"" is a catchy song. But that's about it for this album. The rest is disposable, cliched alt-rock that doesn't have any hooks to it. The playing is good, but all the songs seem to follow a formula. If it's your thing, you might like it, but I prefer better songs. (Although, give them credit for actually writing and playing, as a reviewer who liked the album did bellow)."
3,"Eh, it wears off.","I remember buying this album a year or so after it came out- I thought it was brilliant. It wears off though, the 'southern grunge' feeling gets too annoying."
1,"Boring, boring...",Bought this CD based after hearing 'Kryptonite'. Very quickly discovered that it was the only thing remotely worth listening to on the CD. I'm hoping their next CD will be called 'The Better Music'.
2,"BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...SOUNDS LIKE ANY OTHER ROCK CD.","3 Doors Down is nothing new. Their first single ""Kryptonite"" sounds like anything else. The voice is like anything else.....etc, etc, etc.Just see their video on VH-1 or MTV and you will see nothing new here, except for the video which pushes into a new direction.This CD is just average with nothing new to talk about."
3,not too shabby...,"When I first heard Kryptonite, I wasn't too impressed. But after I heard Loser for the first time, I was into them. I rushed to the store and shelled out the dough for this CD. I got it home and played it...I have to admit, the first 4 songs are great, but I wasn't too thrilled with the rest of the album. Most of the other songs sounded like remixes of Kryptonite and Loser. It isn't a total waste to buy this album, but I'm pretty sure that there's something else on your music list. This one can wait."
4,Still the best of 3DD,"Heard the rest, and enjoy them all, but The Better Life is still the best of the 3DD recordings."
5,very attrating,it was so awsome i cant wait to hear the new and more fresh songs to come the new cd is better than the 1st 3
5,"Great band, great album - buy it","This album has not been released in the UK yet, I heard Kryptonite on a US radio station and was hooked.Their music is what I would call 'bouncy'; you find yourself rocking in your chair whether you want to or not.If you liked Kryptonite or Loser then you WILL like the rest of the album, there is no doubt about that as there is not a bad track on it. You usually find when you buy an album, at least one or two tracks get skipped, but not on this one."
4,"powerful,and melodic","i think this album is top notch its simply motavating i am a die hard music lover and love powerful rock and roll and this cd delivers it hits all phases of modern and old style rock if you like too bang your head or just casualy dance about then this is the album for you. although its very typical in its genere its also very inspiring in alot of ways! The choruses are very melodic, the guitars whale, and the drummer has alot of tight chops. if you love creed and all other bands of the late 90's- through 2000 then this is a must have for your collection put it in your cd player kick off your shoes and enjoy a great rock+roll album, or as in my case go to the gym with my walkman and hit the weights!"
5,3DD Best Album,I bought this album when it first came out and I still love it. I'm mainly writing this review to let new fans of 3DD know that this one is still their best. Every song on this track is amazing and still gets routine spins in my CD player. It's also their hardest rocking CD they've put out and it's one every fan should have in their collection.
3,Alright,"For it's time, a decent effort by a mediocre band. Kryptonite is certainly catchy, and the rest of the album is similar in that respect. Makes for a nice listen here and there, but it's not as if this album is anything compared to the genre it is trying to mimic. Worth the money, but for anyone other than a die hard fan, it is not a must own."
4,Damn Freakin Awesome,"Hey, I give Brad credit for being the drummer also but, he's not the only one... If I'm not mistaken I think that the lead singer from Cowboy Mouth is the drummer also. And Cowboy Mouth has been out for a bit longer than Three Doors Down. But don't think that this Cd isn't awesome... actually it's one of the best Cd's out there...."
2,"Poor album, even laughable at times","This album proves the theory that if given the right breaks, any band that can put music together can get a record deal.Three Doors Down impressed the hell out of me with ""Kryptonite"", and ""Loser"" is a decent song as well. I decided to give the album a whirl.. let me tell you that almost every other song on the album is one in the same. Weak, repetative guitar licks, backed by weak, often pitiful lyrics.This album has no appeal whatsoever, and nothing to offer except what the radio plays. It almost seems as if Three Doors Down recorded the two radio hits first, then scrapped the rest of the album together in a day or two. Unless these guys change something drastic for the next album, we'll never hear from Three Doors Down again."
1,How can this be happening?,"I've tried to buy into the hype about this band, but after repeated listening, I can only come away from the session with a sincere feeling of frustation about the sake of Rock and Roll today.Where is the dedication to an innovative idea? How about some element of mastery of your instrument? What happen to creativity? Re-hashed, un-envolved, un-inspired and bland music are all that I can find located on this CD. How long have these guys been playing? Months? Weeks? DAYS?It's a sad time in the history of Rock and Rock if this is decided to be the best of the new.What's next? Kid Rock elected to the RnR Hall of Fame? Kill me now, please!I can already see the future commercial for K-TEL's latest compilation disc.""Hey man is that Crappy High School Rock? Well turn it OFF dude!""FH"
2,a nickle or two,"if i had a nickle for every time i had listened this CD striaght through without skipping a track i would have... a nickle or two! The fact of the matter is that it has a couple of songs worth a listen, but they arent numerous enough to warrent the cost of the CD. A bit of a disapointment. There are also alot of bands who are better and more consistant, my advice... buy one of their albums.Over all it has but a few reasons why u would want to buy it:1. You are a die hard fan of theirs (highly unlikely)2. The head of the Russian mafia has a gun to your head(slightly more likely)3. For keeping the King of England out of your face (just play ""Down Poison"" and he'll run(a decent reason but u will also suffer))4. As an expensive coaster (nuff said)"
4,Pretty damn good,"This band has come out with a good start. Everything has worked for them, they have several really good hits on this CD, and the CD is just good straight threw. Every song tells a story, and seems complete. One complaint: lay off the attempt at hard-rock, ure not good at it!"
4,a good cd,"i buy cds on impulses, and when i heard kryptonite i knew i wanted 'better life'. i got it, listened to it, and liked it pretty well. i would've really liked a faster song on the cd. my favorite is #3, duck and run. i was happy that the lyrics were, enclosed a major plus for me. overall they make enjoyable music and this is a cd worth buying."
5,A Great Start..........,Excellent album from these Mississippi homeboys. Good straight foreward rock-n-roll. Gets better with each listen. Looking foreward to their next album. Catch them live if you can....
4,"Don't listen to the ""official"" reviewer!","True, you can hear hints of Candlebox, Metallica, and many other influences on this MISSISSIPPI based band. Jason doesn't even know where they are from! I would highly recommend this CD. It may not set your pants on fire, but you will listen to whole thing."
1,cd defect,"I love the music that I ordered but there was a small problem. I could not listen to it without it skipping because of a manufactures defect called silve that went across the disc that would not allow clean play. It would keep skipping. The reason I know what it was is because I work at a cd manufacturing company that makes cd's and dvd's this disc could not have possible passed there inspection test without failing for an uncorrectable error or e22 error. This is not amazons fault though so I will still continue to order through them, I just got a bad disc."
4,Good ol' Rock n' Roll,"""The Better Life"" is a strong debut for 3DD, sounding a bit like the band Creed on steroids, but with better riffs and a more straightforward attitude. Each song is well done, so you can let it play straight through without having to hit the skip button all the time. Standout tracks: Kryptonite, Loser, Be Like That, and Duck and Run. Good Buy!"
5,Local Band Makes Good,It has been amazing how fast 3Doors Down has risin to the top of the rock charts in a little over a year. They have gone from playing local clubs to now playing major tours thanks to the smash Kryptonite. Kryptonite has been playing on the Mississippi Gulfcoast for over a year and a half when WCPR picked up the bands demo. Kryptonite became the most requested song in the stations history and was song of the year for 1999. Loser is the next single and is also a great song. Down Poison is my favorite on the CD. I usually listen to classic rock but this CD has been one of the best new ones I have heard in about ten years. Not bad for a little old band from Jackson County in Mississippi.
5,awesome cd,i listened to the cd and almost fell in love with the music i have the whole cd almost memberized it simply rocks!!! if you want a good cd that will never go dull here is one for you reccomend it to friends if you dont have it GET IT!!!!!!
4,Rigging? Yes! Animation? No!,"Actually, I'm quite pleased with this one. Alright, it's not the best book about 3d I've ever read, but if you want to learn how to set up your characters and how to build logical control systems in Maya, it's awesome. I really loved that you're not ""alone"" - The book ships with 2 DVDs, with extensive Video Coverage (unfortunately in quite bad quality) and shows you exactly how you're dealing with problems.Well, if you want to learn how to rig characters in Maya, this is the book for you. But if you want to learn how to create nifty animations and already know everything you need to know about Rigging - You'll make a mistake with buying this book!One last thing about the sample files: The sample data is awful. You'll rig a character model that's not even third rate (actually, it's converted from NURBS to Polygons) and therefore it's a lot more techical than many of you would prefer..."
2,"Buy an Avishai Cohen album, just not this one.","Cohen remains one of my favorite contemporary composers and musicians, but amony his body of work there are a few duds. This is one of them. ""Unity"" is another. While even on these albums there are moments of raw brilliance, there is a tendency to become to groove-oriented, become bogged-down, even, dare I say it, smooth."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I was given this album as a present and am thankful that I did not pay for it. Instead of the daring Jazz music I had known Cohen's previous albums to be, this mish-mash of an album left me deeply disappointed. Is he a pianist or vocalist or bassist?Who cares anymore..."
5,These really are the greatest pans!,"We got these a year and a half ago, and they are amazing. They take all the abuse we give them, and they still cook amazingly evenly. We do hand wash them, but, don't tell my husband, I've thrown them in the dishwasher before. I've never used such an evenly heating pan, especially on a gas stove. I can't recommend these enough."
3,Um....,"This book wasn't the best one I've read about hairstyling. The book does give a few good hair-care tips, but many of the styles in here are a little difficult to do and I don't think anyone who isn't good at hairstyling would be able to do them without help. Most of the styles in this book are for special occassions like weddings, dates, and vacations. ""The Complete Book of Hairstyling"" would be a good book if you want to find a style for one of the occasions above, but other then that, it would be wise to skip this book."
3,Complete book of hairstyling,"I found this book informative and interesting, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for. If you looking for a step by step book, Hair: A Book of Braiding and Styles/Book and 3 Scrunchiesby Anne Akers Johnson looks like it would be more help."
2,Not what I thought,"I am doing my own hair for my wedding. This book has a wedding section so I thought it would work. It did not.Unless you like the kind of hairstyles that are impossible to maintain and that you only see on a runway model, do not buy this book. The majority of the styles are odd and not for every day life. If you are the kind of woman who doesn't believe in spending more than 25 minutes on your hair, Do Not buy this book. These styles take at least an hour to complete and are very hard to do at all.There is one good thing about this book. It does give good advise on coloring and conditioning. So, if that is what you are looking for, do buy it.This book led me to believe I was purchasing a hairstyle book. In reality it is only good for hair treatment, because of the unrealistic quality of the styles that they offer."
1,Buy this book to be told what you are doing wrong,"The tips in this book are not for real people, they are written for people who have too much time and money to spend on their hair. I do not know anyone who actually has the time to wash, condition and blow dry their hair in the manner detailed in this book, let alone style it. The author makes it sound like you MUST blow dry your hair and coat it with expensive styling products in order for it to be healthy; there is something wrong with that thinking. If you have the time and the money to spend hours on your hair, this book is for you."
3,hairstyling book,Initially I ordered this book for myself but the styles were complicated as well as geared to bridal looks and I was looking for everyday looks. I gave it to my daughter who is getting married in June.
4,It was just okay..not that great.,I liked this book because it has some good hairstyles and hair care tips and techniques but for the size of the book I thought it would have a lot more hairstyles than it did. and I dont really like the whole storyline of the four girls either. so I give it a four. now im looking for a book thats just hairstyles and techniques with step by step insructions. What I thought this book would be like.
2,Completely Unimpressed,"Sorry, didn't like it. For one, i was expecting a little more ""how-to"" info, which this does NOT provide. It has these rather stupid characters it follows to illustrate tips and what not to do. Just not impressed. It did have a few hairstyles I might try out, but overall I was disappointed."
3,hairstyling,"i thought this books was going to be geat, its not a bow then this is great or you like doing weired hairstyles you will love it.ad book. it tell you good ways to take care of your hair and more indetail information that i think is great but the hair styles are few and there nothing i would do, pretty radical and unuaral. if your a model and weird hair is your show or you like doing weired hairdos then you will enjoy this book. its not what i was lookng for."
5,compelling easy-to-understand book,"This book is just wonderful because while you read it, the author gives you illustrative examples whereby you understand general policies and ideologies within the economy. It is just a five and odd star winner!!"
2,Way Too Convoluted. Nothing New In Here,"I've read some 30 books on story craft and this is easily one of the least useful of the bunch. This author doesn't believe in Outlines but this book could have definitely benefitted from one. Not only is the information put forth in a confusing manner, the author compounds this by attempting such things as trying to make up new terminology for age old story elements (apparently in an attempt to sound original and to convince you she has some pearls of knowledge that no one else has thought of).If you're looking for a useful source of story elements, this isn't the book. ""Story"" by McKee ""The Writer's Journey"" by Vogler and ""Building Better Plots"" by Kernen are FAR better, and more importantly, they are straight forward and easy to use in regards to your own work."
3,Great Start For Plot-Newbies,"Look, the book isn't Shakespere, but for someone like me who smiled and nodded--and that's about it--when I head the term, ""plot,"" there is good information to glean. However, even after finishing the book, I didn't feel like a master of plotting. Two of the best books on plots that I've read are ""Scene and Structure,"" and the more recent, ""Plot and Structure."""
2,Not about Plot,"I've read this book twice, the first time several years ago, and just recently when deciding if I needed to keep it. From the time I first read it, I've had a couple novels published. If this book had been named ""Some Stuff About Writing,"" it would have been okay. But unfortunately, it does not address the subject of Plot in a organized fashion, and was not useful to me when I was trying to learn how to plot. As other reviewers have mentioned, the author's use of some terms is unique. If I went to a meeting of writers and started talking about The Rule of Three, I would receive strange looks. Some neat things in the book, but it does not live up to its title."
3,FYI,"""Ansen Dibell"" is Nancy Dibble, a graduate of the Iowa Writers Workshop, MENSA member, and native of Staten Island. She writes sci-fi/fantasy novels. Given her genre & personality, it's not surprising that readers find this book more affective than cognitive, more subjective than objective, more random than systematic. Those who share these qualities find value in the book; those who don't are critical--as reviews on this page indicate. Non disputandum. The telling point is that Dibble uses fiction to solve ill-formed problems that she is confronting in her life. Using creative writing as an instrument of growth isn't unusual, for those with a Romantic disposition; but using fiction to work out personal problems or as wish fulfillment enters the realm of Psychology or even pathology, even when imagination succeeds in transforming experience into fables. There's a danger in working in Middle Earth: The return to reality can be downhill.She died March 7, 2006 in Cincinnatti OH."
1,About the Author,"I have been reading the 1 star reviews and most of them complain that they can't find any of the author's other work to read to see if she is actually a bad writer. It seems that none of the reviewers had the brain power to actually look up the author. While Wikipedia was only 4 years old when one of the reviews was written, the name Ansen (Anson) Dibell could have been Googled. Her real name was Nancy Ann Dibble. One of her books was Pursuit of the Screamer written in 1978. The last thing she wrote was published in 1985 and this book was written in 1988. That should be a clue as to its awfulness. 1) it was written in the 80's, and 2) it was written by a woman. Now I am not bashing women, but I have read sci-fi and fantasy stories written by women, and not one of the books was any good. Dragons of Summer Flame by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman was one of the worse fantasy stories I have ever read."
5,A precission guided exploration,"As a writer I have always had trouble with the concept of plot. Ms. Dibell really dissects what a plot is and the many elements that make it up and move it forward. She did an outstanding job in dissecting George Lucas's Empire Strikes Back in illustrating her points. A lot of the things she referenced I missed when I watched the movie, and had to rent to see the illustrations she was referencing. I can't wait to use the ideas and tools she suggested in my next work of fiction."
2,One of the Weakest Writers Digest Books,"As far as I can tell there is no textual difference between the ""1999"" paperback edition shown here and the earlier 1988 hardcover version.It's a rambling pastiche of ideas and commentary on various aspects of writing, with only loose homage paid to the actual topic of ""plot."" There is much better guidance available on most of the wide array of topics the author touches on so briefly (and inadequately) in this book. One's time would surely be better spent with such helpful titles as:Plot & Structure: Techniques And Exercises For Crafting A Plot That Grips Readers From Start To Finishby James Scott Bell.Beginnings, Middles & Endsby Nancy Kress.Characters & Viewpointby Orson Scott Card.I'm not saying there is nothing at all valuable in the Dibell book; that's why I assign it two stars rather than one. But it's too much effort for too little result to extract the value."
2,Disappointing.,"Compared to 1.0 and Onda, this one left me cold. Maybe it was a little too quiet and moody for my tastes... I wanted upbeat dance numbers, and this didn't deliver that."
5,A tremendous voice and a great selection of songs,I just saw her at the Fort Smith Riverfront Blues Fest and she was dynamite. A great performer. Great vocals; the review from Living Blues is way out of line.
4,"Great voice, lousy guitar","If only Susan could find a professional backup band she would be impossible to top. Vocals are great, strong and soulful, but please find a good guitar player."
2,Won't even warm-up!,"I have seen Susan Tedeschi, and was totally underwhelmed by what I heard. SHe seems to have a powerful PR machine behind her, probably the same one that tries to convence us that Kenny Wayne Shepard, Jonny Lang and Shannon Curfman are ""Blues"" people. Anyone who is serious and ""really"" knows the Blues genre and realizes that it is more than just hard rock blues guitar played by someone not old enough to get into a bar, have a wife or facing an uncertain future. I suspect that most reviewer giving her 5 stars are the same people who give Kenny, Jonny and Shannon 5 stars. Either they don't have a clue or a clue or hint of blues is all they can really relate to. Debra Coleman is the one to be heard and listened to, not just because she is the a black woman born of the blues tradition, but because she is the real deal not trying to play at being a blues artist. Debra's playing reflects rock influenced elements but her voice is pure blues as is her song writng."
1,"More ham, anyone?","I bought this record having read some positive press, what a let down! The vocals are so over the top and hammy - it's a complete joke. It's like a bad Bonnie Raitt parody -especially ""Angel From Montgomery"". Bonnie should slap her around for that one."
1,Hail Gilda!,"Gilda Radner has risen from the dead to do a Janis Joplin imitation. She chose an amatuer band, recorded it in someone's garage, and people are giving it five star reviews!"
2,good performer - disappointing CD,"I liked her live show and she's a good singer, but this is a bad-sounding record with bad songs and bad guitar licks. Hoping she will do better next time round"
3,Better in person. Arn't we all,"Saw her in person at the Britt Festival in Jacksonville, OR. Opened for Jon Lee Hooker. A really great show, very enjoyable and good blues/rock combination. Liked the first CD much better."
2,"Great Soulful Voice, lose the band.","I live for good blues music. I bought this disc in anticipation of the B.B.King Blues Festival coming to town. What a disappointment though. Susan can really wail and will just get better with time. The biggest problem is the guitar playing on this disc. I have to skip certain tracks when I listen to this CD because the lead work is so awful. I hope that I'm pleasantly surprised when I see her next week in concert. If you're looking for a newer artist whose CD you can listen to all the way through, try Tommy Castro's Right as Rain instead. No bad tracks on that one."
5,Susan rocks!,"Imagine B.B. King as a woman 50 years ago. There you go. Susan is a good guitarist, not the best. What sells this is the music and the attitude. It's like the occasional odd B.B. King riff, you pass by it becuase it's blues and the feeling is there. Not only do the songs rock, but I would say she simly has the best bluesy voice I've ever heard by a woman. I just can't believe there isn't a thrid CD yet. C'mon, what's the holdup? www.writingsongs.comDave"
5,I Can't Leave It Alone!,I heard one of Susan's songs playing on the radio one day and decided that I needed to hear more! This CD has become one of my favorites and is never far from the stereo (unless it's in my car!) I have come to know and love every track! My favorite has got to be Looking for Answers but they all have touched me one way or another. Her singing is so soulful and moving. I recently had the opportunity to see Susan perform at the Ben & Jerry's Folk Festival and in Cohasset. I was in awe! She is amazing. I can't recommend this CD enough!!
4,Great CD but pales by comparison to her live presence,"We went to see Susan T. at the South Shore Music Tent near her hometown south of Boston last night. She just totally blew everybody away! High energy, great emotiveness on fast and slow blues and several other styles. Great voice, and her guitar playing has progressed tremendously. She tried too hard on a couple of solo's, but a couple of others really smoked. My initial comment is really not a criticism of the CD, its one of my favorites, but now that I've seen her live, getting this energy and passion onto any form other than a live recording would be like trying to bottle lightning. One thing is clear when she takes the stage; this girl really means it and it shows in every way. Thanks for a great night, Susan and Band."
2,Technically assured; emotionally challenged,"Where is the feeling? What good are ""chops"" when you've nothing to say? This woman's vocals leave me completely cold. The phrase ""white bread"" comes to mind, and I can't help wondering, if she were an artist of color, would she have gotten a record deal?"
5,Best Blues CD Since SRV!,"Although she is no SRV in guitar licks, the voice and what she does with what she has guitar wise makes this one of my three favorite discs in my collection (below Texas Flood and equal to Doyl Bramhall's Bird Nest on the Ground).If you are looking for Etta James, buy Etta. Want SRV? Buy SRV. Want a heckuva voice with the guitar chop potential to eventually rival the best, buy this.The corporate reviewers and critics are clueless on this one, ALL the musicians I jam with love this one..."
3,Great Content - Talented - Quality Recording Disappointment,"I ORDERED THIS CD SOLELY ON BASIS OF DOWNLOADING ""IT HURT SO BAD"" - I ALSO LOVE ""LOOKING FOR ANSWERS"" & ""ROCK ME RIGHT"" - I FELT LIKE I WAS LISTENING TO A RECORDING MADE IN THE 70'S THROUGH THAT MAY BE PRODUCER'S INTENT. NOT A FULL RICH, SOUND I FEEL IT COULD BE - VERY MUCH EVOKES THOUGHTS OF BONNIE RAITT & JANICE JOPLIN, I LIKE SUSAN'S LYRICS, HER CD WILL GET ME IN THE MOOD FOR THE KING BISCUIT BLUES FESTIVAL IN HELENA, ARKANSAS I'M ATTENDING THIS WEEKEND - HOPE SHE HEADLINES THERE SOME DAY, I AM SURE SHE IS DYNAMITE LIVE. FROM A BLUES FAN."
1,No dynamic = big bore,"Sounds like Bonnie Raitt on amphetamines - there is no dynamic to her vocals whatsoever, - all one speed (high). As a result, the CD gets boring really fast. A comparable problem to Natalie Merchant, who sounds dosed on valium, no dynamic whatsover- all one speed (low). Another bore."
1,"Not Janis, Not Melissa, Not Bonnie, Not interesting","I bought this based on the number of 5 star reviews here. Guess I found out why they make chocolate and vanilla ice cream. There's a spark of potential there, but to mention this singer in the same breath as Janis Joplin is ludicrous. Anyone who compares her Angel From Montgomery with Bonnie R's cannot honestly say Susan is ready for prime time."
1,Bonnie and Janis? I don't think so.,"She can obviously sing, but the CD really isn't worth the 12 bucks - it's so over the top it's aggravating, and the production and songs suck. Let me know when she calms down and starts to make MUSIC."
1,Don't be fooled..,"by the four star reviews on this page like I was. This is no Janis Joplin, more like Gilda Radner doing Janis on an old Saturday Night Live."
1,C'mon folks . . .,"OK, I have to admit I'm being very hard on the woman -- she is quite a talent. But GEEZ, Susan, give up playing the Bonnie Raitt wanna-be with ""Angel From Montgomery"" which you latched onto as your ""signature"" encore in your live shows -- more like a forged signature, since Bonnie Raitt has been doing that for 20 years or more, and your version is ripped right from her performances. No points in my book for flagrant disregard/respect for your elders."
1,Stinks. Stunk. Stank.,"I just saw this girl ""perform"" on a CNN Grammy special. She stunk. I can't believe that she is up for a Grammy. Stinkiest New Artist?"
3,On Her Way,"I've read the reviews. I own th CD and, quite frankly, was 'tad bit dissappointed. Don't get me wrong, the woman certainly has a lot of heart. Then again , I have to agree with the previous reviews in that the experience is not there. A lot of the ""great Ms. Bonnie Raitt's"" earlier albums did not do her complete justice.......but blues fans across the world could hear her MAJIC no matter. One of the reviews I read named predictability.......taht is true. I must also add, that I thought that she did a pretty fair job of ""Mama, She Treats Your Daughter Mean"". She's young, has a long way to go, but is on the right track. Some are later to come into total fruition than others. Let's not be too willing to say that this prson isn't viable as a blues artist. I think that she is holding her own. With time, if the world doesn't knock this part of her soul out of her, she could be a contender. Then we'll all be sitting back saying, ""i was listening to her then'."
5,Absolutely great!,This is a really fun album. She can rock the house. Great dancing tunes. Belter's voice. On line reviews way too tepid.
4,Very Good album,"It's nice to see a local girl do so well. Despite her appearence, Susan can really belt them out. She is a very good female blues singer and if you are not sold by this album check her our blasting her way through Zepplin cover tunes of Double Troubles excellent album. She is no Lou Ann Barton who is an absolute force of nature, but she is a very good blues singer and a solid song writer. This is a well crafted blues album worthy of any blues fan collection."
4,"young, raw.... will move up...","This was a great way to be introduced to Susan Tedeschi... she is young, raw and reminds us of Bonnie Raitt. Of course, she doesn't have the lust of voice and guitar playing that Bonnie does... but, who knows... maybe she will move up!"
4,Rocks me right.,Saw Susan in Pittsburgh after purchasing this CD. The women rocked my world. Her voice is better live! Great performer who enjoys her music. I have high hopes that her career keeps growing. Look out ladies of Lillith in Motown.
2,"Good, not great","Susan Tedeschi is a legitimate blues player, but not nearly the type of musician deserving of so much hype. The comparisons to Janis and Bonnie would be unfair, except that she seems to invite it--doing ""Angel From Montgomery"" in a knock-off version of Ms.Raitt's. She is much more successful on her take of ""Momma, He Treats Your Daughter Mean"", at least THAT sounds original! The ability to take a standard, and reshape it into something unique, is what separates the great blues players from the pack. Right now, Ms. Tedeschi is learning this."
5,Vintage Blues with Modern Twist,"This album is excellent. There is some great blues guitar on this album that sounds very familiar but new. Susan brings Janis Joplan and Melissa Etheridge to mind, but with a slightly smoother voice (actually I prefer Susan to the two). I highly recommend this album. Just buy it."
4,Makes one pay attention and listen.,"This lady grabbed my attention on the local radio station, WFPK. She first made me think of Joplin...after hearing the cd, I thought of no one else! Yes, I think she could improve, but who couldn't and why should one stop trying? I'm looking forward to hearing this woman for a long time and will be greatly disappointed if she pays attention to those reviews that get published in the media!"
2,"She can sing, but shoot the guitar player","I really dig Susan's voice, and I believe she has passion for her music. However, the songs she chose to sing, the guitar solos, and price I paid for this cd really, well, suck. I dont think I have ever heard such immature, stylistically shallow, and, well, sucky solos on a ""produced and released"" album ever! I mean, didnt someone listen to this cd before they released it? My suggestion: get someone to burn you the songs you like, and save your money for Buddy Guy."
4,Living Blues Review Is Rediculous,Susan Tedeschis' 1st commercially released CD is very good. The Living Blues reviewer obviously dosen't appreciate Susan's attempt to release a varied album. I look forward to seeing her music mature in the coming years.
2,just won't burn...for real,"I bought this CD after hearing her for the first time on a local radio station. I was excited at the prospect of the appearance of a new female blues singer/guitarist and couldn't wait to hear all of the tracks. However, after listening to the disc twice (a general rule of thumb for me is to listen to an album twice before making a judgement) I became bored with her monotonous style of singing. I felt the guitar solos were lukewarm and ineffective. The whole album seemed to be detached from the real essence of the blues which is of course the expression of profound feeling ie, anger, desire, sadness, hopelessness, and even joy."
2,A perplexing album,"This CD had the potential to be really great, but for one thing: Ms. Tedeschi for whatever reason was allowed to play her own solo bits. Why? Who knows. But they absolutely ruin otherwise rockin' tracks, and as a muscian I can't understand why her amateurish (at best) playing was ever allowed onto this album. Chalk it up to producer incompetence if you wish.Ms. Tedesci does have one of the great new voices I've heard, that is one thing no one can argue. However, I find it exceedingly difficult to enjoy any one song due to her poor work on the guitar. In the future she would do well to leave the guitar to the professional studio musicians until her performances cease resembling aural train wrecks. Practice time should not, after all, be conducted on a global stage."
5,THE BLUES VOICE OF THE 21ST CENTURY!,"This awesome collection of songs covers the full range of Susan Tedeschi's phenomenal talent. Ms. Tedeschi's voice is in a class by itself full of emotion and soul not seen since the likes of Janis Joplin. Her songwriting skills are exceptional and show an honest and heartfelt understanding of life's ups and downs. Thanks to her Grammy Nomination, this album will get the exposure it deserves and place Susan Tedeschi at the forefront of American music in the 21st century."
3,good daylight general purpose camera,"hmmmpc-cam 750 has it all.. video, audio, webcam, pictures.and it works fine.. with one exceptionlighting!pictures are either too dark or too brightdonno what is the problemworks ok in daylight but not otherwiseso you have to take care in that regardalso it is a 1.3MP camera.. only interpolated to 2.1MPit has a good sensor.. still does not perform as well as expected...i would suggest you better buy a HP model available for $180 with optical zoom, lcd and memory slots than this one at $110"
3,Intec is a decent alternative,"I first noticed Intec products at Toys R Us, and have since seen them in a few other places. They aren't as big as Pelican or Interact, but they make some decent items. This pack is a nice collection of general GBA accessories. I would also recommend the Power Station, which will charge your GBA for 15 hours of play AND hold 6 game cartridges. I would say stay away from the shield light they offer- It's uneven light isn't good for playing in the dark, and when you turn on the light while your GBA is already on, it will RESET your GBA. Not good if you need to turn on a light in the middle of a game! Still, their prices are decent and they make a lot of great items. I'd call Intec a trustworthy company."
3,value pack,these things are good enough but dnt u think u have to include a spare lens if the original lens gets scratched? its hard to find a replacement lens so why not include it in the pack.
2,Not Accurate at All,"As a scholar who deals with a lot of rare material, I thought this pen would be a god-send in helping me transcribe material to my computer. The manufacturer boasts near-100% accuracy. I give it 40% at best. Sometimes, if you have a white piece of paper, clear, 12-point text, you can get 80% accuracy, but this is a rare occurrence.I ended up spending more time ""correcting"" the text from the Iris Pen than I would have typing it out...so now my $70 ""tool"" sits unused on my desk.I can't wait for the day that an actual pen-scanner works, but today is not that day."
1,Get the Cpen instead!,"In short - THE IRIS PEN SUCKS, buy the CPen instead.I am a law student who had used the Cpen 800C for the past two years. I have become completely dependent on it and was crushed when it died. It turns out Cpen no longer makes that model (was portable, didn't have to be connected to your computer to use) so I stupidly decided to try the IRIS pen. It is a 100% waste of money - it scans crap on a perfect surface and is even worse on my textbook pages that are ivory instead of pure white. After two frustrating days of trying everything I could think of to get the IRIS to scan accurately, I bought the CPen 20. It works perfectly , you can get a 2 or 3 year warranty for $5 or $10 bucks, and for $13 I got a mousepad that allows you to use it as a mouse (very cool!)"
1,Do NOT get this product,"This product fails miserably at every type of text I tried. Any font, any size, any color, it simply didn't work. I spent more time scanning, pasting, and FIXING the errors than I would have ever spent typing the text directly myself.This isn't even a good value if it were offered FREE because of the frustration level. Plus, as a Mac user, it is so clunky as to make me want to throw it out the window (I returned it instead).Do NOT buy this unless 1) you have a very high frustration tolerance 2) you like using white-out 3) you have $100 you want to waste or 4) need to own every gadget, even if they don't remotely work.Have I been clear enough how little I think of this product???Cheers!"
1,Poor product,This 'scanner' is a joke. I returned it the same day.It was very poor in reading text. Total waste of money.
2,iris pen,it doesn't pick up the data very quickly and is very sensitive to how the lighting is in the room/on my desk. It almost isn't functional in my office space (which has lots of shadows as it has dark wook walls/ceiling.
2,Train wreck,"I really wanted to like this. I kept reading and hoping it would turn a corner that it never did. I couldn't get a clear picture of the heroine and there wasn't enough time spent on the lead male. So, so, so many unnecessary, useless, distracting paragraphs about techie stuff - I ended up bored and frustrated at a waste of a decent storyline."
5,Surprisingly Good Read,"A surprise for me anyway because I don't generally go in for the Romance genre. But I liked it. Liked the plot twist, even though I saw it coming. You can pick up on little hints here and there so it's not as shocking as it may seem to some. All in all a good read. AND it now has me more interested in the genre, something that's never happened before. Looking forward to reading more about the Coxwells!"
3,Good read,"Wordy at times, and to much information to care,but overall a good romance story for the heart, and even though wordy,I'm instrested in the next story of the coxwells."
4,Awesome,Very good book! Never take what is not yours! It normally has a way of finding it`s owner !Enjoyable!
2,boring,Double trouble took a while to get in to and then jump to so many non important things. I could skip a page or two and would miss anything. It could have been so much better!
2,EHHH,I couldn't really get in to it. Spent too much time on unimportant details and not on the main story.
2,I Just Can't Finish...,"I have had this story for a few months now and I have started it many times. I just can't finish. I don't find the main characters sympathetic enough to what is going on around them...and for the age the main character is stated to be, I find her immature and rude...thus, why I just can't finish the book. I think the basic plot line is solid, but the characterization just fell short for me."
4,Surprisingly good,Thought this was a good book. Read this one cause it was free and I really liked it. Definitely will read other books by this author.
4,Rich characters,I Liked that the characters were flawed and real lots of story pacing was good made me care.I recommend.
5,What Fun!!! Loved the humor and attitude,"I loved this light-hearted, warm-fuzzy love story. I especially enjoyed the version of first person narration with side-comments aimed directly at the reader. One review declared that Maralys' character did not develop and I would have to disagree with that. She undergoes some a great deal of character development as does James. And it is a pleasure to watch them grow together. A pleasure to read."
4,LOL book.,Loved it. Light and light hearted reading. Great book for escape reading. Deborah Cook takes the mundane to a humourous level. A wonderful read that had me laughing out loud many times.
2,First Person Narrative,"I had a really hard time getting into this book. It is partial due to the fact that I really dislike first person narrative; I have only read a small handful of books where the writer was able to pull of the first person narrative.The main character is not, imo, at all sympathetic. She is sometimes quite off-putting. I also find that the author just drones on and on with completely unrelated and not at all essential to the story line topics. I found that I just skipped half the book and not really missing any plot, just so I could get to the end and find out what happened.I only fished this book, because I hate leaving books unfinished."
4,Good Read,"The story starts off rough with family drama but it gets better. I really liked the main character, Maralys. I'm sure others will enjoy the book."
2,Good read,"It was a good book, I wouldn't say it was the best but it was entertained, it was what I expected."
3,Good characters,I liked this book for the story plot. I had to keep reading because I needed to know what was going to happen and the plot had a lot of twists I wasn't expecting. The characters were complex with real emotions and depth. I would have given another star but the writing style was a little disjointed for me and I don't like it when the main character talks to the audience.
4,Couldn't put it down,The twists and turns what a great read. Couldn't put it down. Double trouble was a mesmerizing book. Never saw it coming and it didn't stop till the end. It's a must read book. Can't wait to read the next book.
2,Double Trouble,"I had a hard time getting into this book, and deleted it after a few chapters. Just wasn't enjoyable, didn't like the subject."
3,Okay read,Book was pretty okay but the detailing had me bored and the character just don't seem to be interesting. I find this book o missing a little Zest by I'll buy book 2 maybe the story get better
3,Good read,"Nice twist, ending was predicted table however. Expected more trouble from the sister, and possibly a cat fight. Would read it again anyhow."
1,what???,This book is in need of editing. There is SO much rambling and jumping off topic that you can easily skip half the book and not miss anything plot worthy.
3,Double Trouble (The Coxwells),This book had an intense plot but had too much unneeded drivel. I found myself skipping through the info that was completely pointless. Slow read but not a complete waste of time..
2,Very slow read,I'm not sure I will finish this book. I like the main character and her spunk but she gets too side tracked telling her story. She just keeps dragging along talking about randomness. It's really annoying.
3,Double Trouble,"I thought the book was just OK. I usually like stories about twins; but, I wasn't crazy about this book. I didn't care for the way it was written. In the middle of a scene, they put a ""Dear Mary"" in there? why? I probably won't read another book by them. sorry."
3,eh,It's an interesting book. I like how it's written more as a normal person talking/thinking.and she does have a killer sense of humor.
4,Enjoyable reading,"I liked the book, I couldn't put it down. It was funny, sexy,romantic and you find yourself caught up in the story. I definitely recommend this book."
5,Good stuff,"I liked this book. I read for entertainment and that is what I got! If you can read as if the character is talking directly to you about her crazy mixed up life, you've got a great read. I loved how the character slowly evolved into the hidden person she tried to conceal,even from herself."
3,I little bit creepy,This book was fun and kept me interested. A bit long winded though like the other reviewers said so perhaps skip some pages. I did find the twins premise a bit creepy.Spoiler alertI found it a bit strange that one twin stole the other bf then married him. Then they divorced and he ends up marrying the other twin. Why even bother with the photographer just say the old wedding photos were of her. Imagine the confusion. Dropping the kids off to school and explaining ' I'm his new wife. I just happen to look identical to his old wife.'
4,good read but...,"This was a very good book, the only problem I had with it was, it was so drawn out and then bang the ending was short. I'm looking forward to other books by this author."
2,Just ok,Some steamy parts. Cute story line. Cheesey perfect happy ending. Not a reread or page turner. It's a nice easy read but just ok.
3,Wrong pick,If I purchased it it was a mistake I was not wanting to see this movie I really don't want to review it
4,good book,I really enjoyed this book. Although i knew where it was heading from the beginning. It wasn't hard to figure out but i did enjoy it.
5,Undiscovered Treasure,"This book is wonderful, funny and touching. Yeah, I know people throw these terms around but this really is an unfairly neglected favorite. Maralys' voice is a joy to read. The revelation of the events that have shaped her unique character is particularly effective.Claire Cross/Delacroix does a great job with the first person; I've been searching for a new title for years, in vain, alas. Grab it - get one for your best friend while you're at it."
5,Hilarious!,I don't think i've ever read a book like this one before. I loved the humour and the lack of sexual content. I must get the whole series.
2,"Creepy, creepy, creepy","I don't care how screwed up your family is, it is beyond creepy to marry your identical twin's ex-husband. And even creepier that he married the twin thinking she was her sister. Perhaps you should get to know people better before you jump the broom."
2,Double trouble,"An ok read.The story line was pretty UN-believable.I can't see how any sister could knowingly steal her sister's boyfriend. I honestly don't know how any sister, much less twin could actually sleep with her brother in law."
2,Wouldn't recommend it.,"I didn't like the way the main character had to go into so many details to give you an idea ofwhat she was talking about. I mean 2-3 pages of her details was a bit much.I almost didn't finish the book, but of course I had to to see what happens."
3,Less is somtimes more!!!,"I read this book and uuuuggghhh!!! It was exhausting!!!, too much detail. The story line was o.k., it was funny and somewhat easy going, but it just had too much detail; from the character's feelings and thoughts, to the places she (Maralys) went to, to what was the color of her hair!!!Sometimes less is more, too wordy for me!!"
4,Cool Story,I really liked this book. At first it was hard to read sometimes because I felt Maralys went off on many tangents. I did like though how she would talk as if she was talking to the reader from the outside. It was pretty cool. It was a good book.
4,Double Trouble,It was wonderful and hard to put down. I can't wait to read more of this author's books. I would recommend to all.
4,good,I thought this book was pretty good. Not what I expected but at the end I like that she was able to find her happiness.
2,Good effort but..,"This book drove me nuts. It was literally too hard to read. Every sentence or conversation the main character had felt like it just led her off on another tangent where she had to describe the place she lived or her job. I don't find this book at all believable, she absolutely hates her sister, even seems like she almost wishes she'd hear bad news about her, and I just find that a big put off. I'm all about family, I LOVE my sister and I find this character someone who I'd hate if she was real and I met her. Just not my type of book sorry, maybe if this author has another book taht is offered free, I'll try, but I literally couldn't get past the first few chapters of this and I filed it under my ""Unfinished"" category on my Kindle."
4,Good romantic read,"Good recommendation for a holiday read.I think most women can relate to this book. Lot's of true to life moments, and brilliant quotes! Check out the highlighted lines."
3,This droned on and on and on and on.....,"Could have been a good read if the writer would have shut the heck up, on occasion. There were times that I had to really struggle to continue reading this book. There is such a thing as TMI. Until this writer learns to pare down some of their writing,I think that I will have to pass on any more of their work."
2,It was ok,"Pretty good for a free kindle book. Kept me entertained while I was unemployed. Story and charecters were kinda ""meh. ""Would't have paid for it though."
3,Double Trouble ( The Coxsells),Have not finished reading yet. So far so good. Hopefully it will hold my interest and be a good book as well
3,Pictoral memoir - not a coffee table book,"I purchased ""Soldiers On Skis"" as a coffee table book for my home in the Colorado Mountains. It is obvious that alot of work went into making this book happen.It only touches lightly on the training at Camp Hale, on 8 out of 234 pages. It's fine for history buffs, etc. My two complaints about the book have to do with printing and photography.Anybody with a decent scanner and a copy of Adobe Photoshop could have brought most of the photos to life and made a huge difference in the book. The vast majority of the photos are small, grainy and washed out. You will not lose yourself in the photos and be transported to another time. Some of the photos even have text from the previous page bleeding through and ruining them.Overall, I'm surprised that the ball was dropped and so much effort was allowed to be spoiled. It could have been a great book."
4,Well written with fantastic photos,"My father, a 10th Mountain Division veteran of the Italian Campaign, gave his approval and was amazed at the photos. He found himself playing volleyball in one.Soldiers On Skis: A Pictorial Memoir Of The 10th Mountain Division"
5,SONY CCD-TR818 PERFECT USE,I HAVE OWNED THIS SONY CAMERA FOR 12 YEARS..TOOK IT TO MEMPHIS..FLORIDA AND RECORDED SO MANY HOME VIDEOS..REUNIONS..BIRTHDAYS..ETC....IT HAVE RECENTLY STARTED TO SHOW WEAR AND TEAR..BUT THAT IS EXPECTED..I NEVER KNEW THAT THIS VIDEO CAMERA WOULD LAST THIS LONG...I LOVE IT AND WILL BUY ANOTHER ONE....
2,"book is ok, runes are not.","I ordered this product used. The delivery was earlier than I expected. I liked that. The book is easy to read and understand. Each rune including reversed versions have thier own page. Good descriptions also. But the runes were plastic and awful. Maybe new it comes with better runes? If you buy it used, ask questions first. Buy more for the book, order runes seperate?"
3,Interesting Take on Zen and Runes,"I'd been reading up on Zen philosophy and subsequently became interested in Runes and Targot cards. I'm a beginner and found this book an interesting take on both Zen and Runes. For experienced users this may not be for them, then again, maybe they will welcome the change of pace. My book did *not* come with a set of stones, which was a little disappointing and misleading in the description. However, I had already purchased an inexpensive set of stones and was able to follow along. This should not be advertised as a ""kit"" since it is only the book."
3,Be careful what you wish for...,"I bought this CD because I enjoyed cuts from it that I heard on internet radio. It sounded relaxing, pleasing to the ears, yet interesting.However, now that I own the CD and play it in its entirety, it seems to have lost interest and appeal for me. Perhaps it is best heard cut-by-cut mixed in with other music, but may be monotonous played beginning to end non-stop.I know that sounds subjective, but that's the best I can explain as to what happen."
2,Numb Resemblance,"Balance is a mirror of Chuck Wild's first project (Ambience Minimus) 3 years earlier. Unfortunately there is no forward progress in the Liquid Mind series. There is more warmth than it's predacesor ""Slow World"", but that ethereal ""Ambience Minimus"" tone is lacking. Here the tone tends to be outlaid rather than uprisen. Yes it dose maintain that flowing monochromatic state and it's planes dissolve well with some interesting soundshifting. But that is not enough to make this project appealing."
1,Uninteresting and boring.,"After two listens I wondered why I had placed this on my purchase list. The chords, chord progressions and lead up notes kept reminding me of other compositions and left me expecting to hear something else to begin. I found it frustrating to listen to, either actively or passively as background. this CD will not waste space in my library. The interesting cover picture is the only positive I can give."
4,Sounds like...,"martin roman rebelski's first attempt at a solo project comes across as a well-defined, though airy EP. some of you may be familiar with rebelski's work with Doves. on 'thanks for your thoughts,' you can hear a little bit of that Doves sound, but without the inclusion of other Doves members (except on one track) rebelski gets a chance to take us deeper into his world. purely a musical adventure led by piano light, you will surely enjoy 'thanks for your thoughts' if you want to listen to something different than what you're used to, but that is still guided by those strangely familiar ghost-like shadows of Doves band."
2,Piano Handbook,As a beginning piano player this was not entirely what I was looking for. It mostly tells about the origins and evolution of the piano. Very little in the way of instruction.
5,Terrific Piano Book. Learn Piano the Interesting Way,"This is a terrific book on the piano and learning to play the piano. I am taking piano lessons with a piano teacher but find this book a great addition. Carl Humphries is a clear, concise writer who gives you a wealth of information. I've had this book for almost a year now and find myself continually referring back to it and pulling it out to play or replay a favorite piano piece. His selection of music is wonderful with charming works that you'll fall in love with and return to time after time."
5,Perfect,"More than I could wait for. Amazing cover and pages layout, quality and content with focus on beginners and intermediate. This book gives a solid foundation on the basis of piano's world. Highly recommended!! A++"
3,If you're into jazz and popular piano... just don't!,This book is great for beginners who want to learn about music history and classical piano. It attempts to fit too much in one book. The author should have stuck to classical. If you're into jazz and popular piano look elsewhere.
3,I guess I expected something else...,"I guess I was expecting something else when I ordered this book, but I was truly surprised by how little music it has. There's plenty of theory and history on the piano and composers, which I guess is nice, but I was after the music. I used to play at an intermediate level, but I've been away from my piano for too many years and thought this book would be a good refresher. I was just disappointed in the content. The songs that is does have aren't complete, but they're just blurbs to demonstrate part of the theory. On the plus side, it is a really nicely bound book and the spiral lays flat, but ehh..."
3,A big disappointment,"While this book does provide a good history of the piano, and some exercises, this is not a book for a beginner. It could be a valuable reference for someone who knows how to play the piano and just wants to review some fundamentals. I found it to be very dry. When I offered it to my son who is a musician, he quickly disgarded it and said it was too difficult to understand. It's boring. It does not make me want to master piano."
4,Learned a lot.,"This book should be for intermediate to advanced players withreading skills.The book is well bound, covers many different styles and theory,also has cd and written music examples to play.Almost through it, will read thru it a second time probably.Recommended, but not for beginners."
3,previous piano experience required!,"This should be called the ""piano review"" workbook. The problem with experienced teachers and authors is they don't understand the mind of the beginner. They assume we already know things, or gloss over important details, or leave them out all together.I think the author should have spend more time proofing the materials being taught, rather than babbling on with history lessons about people that have no relevance to the topics and techniques being taught.The total glossing over the major and minor scales is horrible. To many ""see if you can figure out...."" without any followup explanation to check our work. To many new concepts found in the musical examples with no explanations as to their meanings.This is not a book for beginners. It is good for picking up a tip here and there if you already have experience.Very disappointed."
2,Not the best beginner book,"If you have prior experience and are looking to rekindle the fire, this may be the book... in which case it may deserve 4 or 5 stars.But I am a beginner, and there seems to be a lot of material delivered too fast!The good: Glossy pages, Spiral binding, a lot of material (it all looks complicated to me, so I guess it's good)The bad: Too much too fast, not a self learning beginner's book.I got the Alfred series, and I feel that their pace is much more in tune with my learning speed."
5,Beginner's Take,This is a bit more advanced than I had anticipated. But as I move into it I find that I am learning very quickly and am impressed by the overall quality of instruction. Sometimes I have a few double takes where I don't fully understand something(I have 0 musical background) but I just pop on the internet for clarification. Using the book combined with various internet sites I'm progressing rapidly.So if you are a beginner and are not easily intimidated go for this book. But know that it doesn't exactly hold your hand through the exercises.
4,Intense study,"Book starts out with a pictorial history, then moves into lessons. The lessons move quickly. Fortunately, there is a CD to let you hear how the music should sound. A lot of theory also. If you want to go a little slower, try ""Play Piano Today!"" by Hal Leonard.Good section in book on buying a piano also (what to look for and buying a used piano)."
4,great jazz vocals,Some really good stuff here. Skylark and A Man with a Horn two of the best. Back up musicians first rate. Will be looking for more Cheryl Bentyne music with anticipation. She may become my favorite female jazz vocalist.
4,Let Me Off Uptown,"Purchased as a gift. Recipient was very pleased with the CD, Said it was just what he wanted. He had sent some hints."
5,An excellent book with surprises.,Simply a remarkable book with lots of surprises within. Some details may shock readers.
4,Delighted,Waited for a longtime for this old rare book which was not available here.Fell in love with the black hard bound cover.The pages were all in good condition eventhough it was printed in 1937. I feel proud to own this great book.I will cherish this book which is older than me
5,"Wonderful book about a young, ambitious doctor.","A. J. Cronin, a doctor himself, wrote THE CITADEL, an excellent, well written book about a doctor just beginning his medical career. Follow him as he sees his first patient, braves the coal mines to save a young boy, finds his wife, and in the end, finds himself."
3,Henry Cooper: The Nearly Man,"British heavyweight boxer Henry Cooper nearly changed the course of boxing history. July 19th 1963 Cooper fought Cassius Clay. In the fourth round Cooper dumped clay on the canvas with his famous left hook, Henry's Hammer. Clearly in serious trouble Clay was saved by the bell. Sensing dire problems for his fighter, trainer, Angelo Dundee in Clay's corner managed to deliberately slit the glove of his fighter (Dundee later admitted having done this on British TV in the late 1980's). When an age had passed and the glove replaced, Clay recovered his senses and went on to defeat the often paper-thin skinned Cooper on cuts. This is just one of the many engaging accounts of the illustrious career of one of Britain's finest fighters that the book tells. This book is a facinating life story tale of Londoner Cooper, a terrific and colorful recital of the ups and downs of professional boxing."
5,Sick,This album is dope.. Its got some spacy/hiphop electronic beatsMy favorite track is Unexpected Delight..Definitely a must have for your Flying Lotus collection..
2,truly useless book,i just took the nbme shelf exam and i must say without reservation that this book was not very good. look to other review books if you want to study for the shelf or for the boards.
1,Poorly organized,Micro Made Simple is a much better book. This can't be used for much more than a quick reference because everything is spread out way too much. Too hard to study for a class or Step 1.
4,"Good review, great questions","This book has covers all the necessary topics, including immunology. But the best part is that it has a total of 416 questions!! This is a great source of practice questions for the USMLE. Still, it could use more pictures and diagrams. Just for the questions its worth the money."
2,Keep Looking...,"If you are looking for a good beginners Spanish language text, keep looking. This book presents under the umbrella of Barron's which is a solid name. This one, however, lacks the two ""C""'s: cohesion and clarity.The package comes with a study guide, a companion book and four CD's. Unfortunately, when you put the study guide and companion book together, you get nothing but confusion. You need to keep switching between books, exercises do not seem to match and on the CD you are not given enough time to respond to the words or phrases.The book does have some positives. It is attractively packaged and the study guide is colorfully illustrated.As an alternative, may I suggest the first text I completed. Frank Zambrano's ""The Everything Learning Spanish Book"" was very helpful. I paired this with a basic audio program and loved it. And it had the two ""C""'s: cohesion and clarity."
2,Surprisingly uninformative and disappointing.,"I expect much more than this from National Geographic, which has been providing informative and well constructed media for us since 1888. This presentation is fairly useless, repetitive and drawn out, with points lost in rambled cycles of poorly scripted dribble better suited for a first-year university student's first weekend natural sciences project. I am actually just sitting here confused as to how this was ever approved for release."
5,Bday present,It was a great present for a little girl turning 2. She loves Little People and they work well with the palace.
3,"Very cute, but instant broken door",I bought this for my year-old daughter last Christmas. The front door fell off on the first day and has to be snapped back in at least 4-10 times each time she plays with it. That's disappointing since this was not inexpensive. But the characters are adorable and it's a nice alternative for younger children.
1,Amazon fails to deliver,"Had Amazon actually delivered this item, maybe I could have given a real review. Since the heater never actually arrived, nor did they send a replacement because conveniently the item no longer exists in their inventory. I can still get the same heater by another vendor through Amazon but now it costs more than twice the amount I paid for it in the first place. So needless to say this was a very bad experience I had with Amazon since nothing was done to satisfy my frustration with the horrible service."
2,BE VERY CAREFUL,This item comes with many warnings as it should. It can be hazardous to use this heater with an adaptor for a two pronged outlet. The product itself is of high quality and runs well just not when you are in the process of renovating a house.
2,Almost a great heater,"I recently bought this heater based on consumer reports ratings and I like almost everything about it except one thing. The thermostat doesn't work every time. So, half the time it is turned on, it just stays on until the room is over 90 degrees even though the desired temperature is set at 72 degrees. I am guessing there is a defect in my unit but it seems to be a fairly common defect as I have read similar complaints on Amazon."
5,good product,"As i expected: timer up to 10 hours, threshold heat (turns off when it reach set temp). Excellent product!However, Amazon should not suggest it to buy along side with a thermostat... I did bought both of them, but when the thermostat reach the set/threshold temperature, the entire heater loose its power, & it will not power up when temperature drops. The heater itself already have the functionality! (please not to sell / suggest to buy both of these items).Thank you"
1,Not at all like the reviews!,"The heater does not have a fan so the room does not go up more than 2 degrees in 4 hour period. I purchassed two of these units, both had defect thermostats and I was reimbursed my full amount. Amazon is the way to order....they were terrific with their customer service in getting my issue resolved. The company that shipped the product, Geroy's also provided top notch customer service! It was just the product that was not so pleasing....no fault of Amaazon or Geroy's!"
2,"Fine, if you don't need a thermostat","It heats well - it could do a larger room very quickly. Its quiet.But:The only controls are a shutoff timer, and a thermostat.The thermostat is not reliable, for me, nor for many other reviewers.The shutoff timer still leaves the room I need warmed, either too warm (stays on HIGH for hours), or too cold, once the timer shut off."
2,"Quiet except for the huge ""CLUNK"" sound that makes at night!",If it wasn't for the loud CLUNK sound it makes when the coils warm up and cool off... this would be a great product... Thus I have no choice but to give it two stars as the CLUNK sound is too loud for my room.... It wakes me up EVERY time.... Silent my a$$
4,room heater,"ordered the honeywell low profiel silent comfort heater and I am very pleased, it's absolutely silent, and puts out heat which helps in other areas of my home without heating up the entire house. I love it"
4,Honeywell HZ519 space heater,"The heater seems to work well. I like that you can set the temperature and have it turn off after a certain number of hours (1 to 10). I use it when I'm in my basement office and only run it for a few hours at a time. One thing I don't like is that every time you turn it on, you have to reset the temperature and time. It automatically comes on with the temperature set to 75 degrees F, and no timer (always on), so I have to press buttons about ten times to get it set where I want it. But, aside from that minor inconvenience, it's doing the job adequately."
5,Honey of a Heater,"I wasn't exactly certain how well this heater would work as I have had others (not Honeywell) which seemed to make the room rediculously hot in a very short time and some which barely did so. I was quite impressed that the heater works very well and provides the right amount of heat within a 3 - 5 minute period. I will add that I am using this in my bathroom and it clearly says in the instructions NOT to use it in a bathroom. But I have it in an area which is well-ventilated and away from anything which could catch fire. It is great to come out of my shower and not have the feeling that I am freezing. I am very happy with the product and have had a few other Honeywell products (Air-Cleaners, Programmable Thermostats) and they all worked really well."
3,Heater Review,The heater is quiet and the controls work as advertised.But this product does not heat the entire room to the temperature setting as advertised. It heats the immediate area around the device to the temp you set so you'd better be close to it to get the heat shown on the temp setting.
4,It works,"I have been using this product for about half a month now. All I would say is that it is not that efficient in terms of heating a moderate size room, but is comfortable for a small room. The unit does not get too hot, which is good and the grill remains relatively warm (not hot - which is good too). An effective addition to existing heating appliances, but definitely not a primary source."
2,"Worked two years, then nothing, wouldn't buy another","Honeywell HZ519 Digital Low Profile Silent Comfort HeaterI used this heater for two years. The thermostat was not accurate, ever. It did heat the room when we set it high, but it didn't shut off.When we brought out the heater in the third year winter, it was dead. Nothing.The screws holding the heater together have a proprietary bizarre head, so you cannot even get into the unit to attempt to determine the problem.No support is available. The manual is worthless.It is very likely an issue with the inferior controlsIt is built in China for Honeywell, and isn't apparently repairable.It is not worth what we paid for it. Cheaper heaters have lasted longer for us.I will likely not buy another Honeywell unit"
2,Maybe for a Very Small Room,"I ordered two of these heaters for two large bedrooms that need some additional heat. The rooms are 15' x 20' with 10' ceilings. Though the heaters get hot, all the heat goes straight up and I can't feel anything unless I place my hand above the units. I'm now packing them up to be returned and looking for something that will work better in a large room."
3,Honeywell HZ519 Digital Low Profile Silent Comfort Heater,"This item did not work out for me. I can see where it would be useful for heating a small room, but I needed something to heat the general area where I sit (in a large room with tall ceilings). The heater is large, takes up a lot of space, and gets very hot. I was afraid to have my cats around it. Even though it seems like it put out a good amount of heat, the opening in the heater let the heat go straight up towards the ceiling. I could not feel the warm air unless standing directly above the unit. Sitting at a desk next to it did not do anything. I have since purchased a smaller unit with a fan that wil push the heat forward where I sit. If you want to warm up a small room over a period of time, this could be for you. If you want a boost of heat in a small area of a large room, go for something else."
5,Very inpressive,"I can't say how much we value this wonderful heater. It's silent, throws off plenty of heat. Built-in thermostat works just fine. We use it on our enclosed front porch in very cold weather."
5,Awesome,This heater is an excellent choice. It is a low profile baseboard design so its not easily tipped over. It heats the room well. I love the temperature control feature. I chose this unit primarily for the safety rating and I am completely satisfied.
4,great,"wow, this keep me toasty. Wish it had these things though:accessory: protective lid so wont get burned.as a tower so won't take up space (instructions say to keep away from wall, furniture etc. which means I have to keep it in my way).auto onremote control"
1,Does not work,"Unless you are sitting on top of the heater, it is useless. My home office is 11 x 10 and it won't heat it."
1,Don't waste your money on this !,"Does not heat period !! It is quiet because it does not do anything. I sometimes wonder if it is working, I have to go very close to feel any heat coming out of it. Don't waste your money on this heater. I always trust Consumer Reports but this time they have got it wrong !!"
1,Never made heat for a second,"I messed up and bought this nice looking heater at Home Depot at the end of the winter....plugged it in the next winter, disappointed that it doesn't work at all. I've messed with it for hours. I'm thinking that if I pour gas over it and light it, maybe it'll at least put off heat for a couple hours. I won't buy Funnyweld/KRAPZ again...unless its for a gift for someone I don't like. Anyone want a Heater?.....it looks great, would be great as a paperweight on a big desk. Can I sue this company if I get frostbite because their device doesn't work??? So much for their quality control guy......I hear they fired him because he kept finding too many nonfunctioning units."
1,Arrived damaged,"The heater still works, but it is dented. Make sure you open and inspect your purchases before the 30-day return policy expires. I made the mistake of leaving the heater in the box until I was ready to use it and now I am unable to return or exchange the item."
1,Amazon Send without good packaging - Can't test,Well this item looked good except it was sent in a way that made a big dent right in the middle of the heater. Returning it was a hassle since I had to stand in line at the post office with a 5 foot box. Then I find out they don't have anymore for a replacemnt in a message but they apparently do 3 days later since they are still selling them right now.Good luck with your purchase. Would probably buy at local store since it does look nice without a dent.Still waiting for my refund!
1,Scared to use it!,"Had the unit set to 68 degrees and came home to a very hot house!If you want to sit and watch it, its fine. But I'm afraid to leave the thing alone.The heater was going full blast and the cord was warm to the touch. I doubled check the thermostat and yes it was set to 68 degrees. I have seen other people complain about digital thermostats on Honeywell's units gone wild. Now I believe.I did get several years of use from the product, but now I afraid to leave it alone. So it's going in the garbage. Who knows what could have happened if it was on longer. The house might not still be here.Going to the store to get the simpler analog heater. You can never be sure that the manufactures don't source the digital parts from the same supplies, so I'm staying away from anything that looks similar.Remember that you are putting families' lives at risk buy using this products. I don't know who is designing these items, but I feel that I could do a better job."
2,Great while it lasted,"I loved this heater! It looked nice and warmed our very entire cold family room thoroughly and silently, unlike former heaters I have bought. I would have given it 5 stars--but the 2 stars are for the little over 2 months it lasted. I went to turn it on the other day and it just didn't heat. There is a warranty, but my husband threw out the box it came in, and it is so oddly shaped I am not sure how to package it for mailing. Wonderful. So now I am back to the cheap heater I bought at Walgreen's a few years ago. It is noisy and only heats a few feet around you, but at least it is a workhorse that hasn't quit on us."
3,Honewell baseboard heater HZ-519,Fairly easy to understand and operate. clear electronic panel. instructions are clear. For a 1500 watt heater it takes longer to heat an area than I would've thought. I have used 400 watt panel heaters that wall mount that I think are far more efficent. Cost was quite reasonable. Item is lightweight and easy to transport.
4,Great heater!,"This is really a great heater. I live in a 1790 stone (cold) farm house and use it to supplement the wood heat. It's quiet, easy to use and heats extremely well. I'm very satisfied."
3,Very steady and safe,but quite slow to heat up. It probably takes about 30 minutes for the heater to really start heating up a room. It is slow but easy to carry around and well designed for safety. It is extremely quiet as in you can not hear it when it's on or off.
1,Does not live up to its rating,"Does not live up to its rating. Doesn't put out any heat. Maybe if it had a fan on it, it would help. Unless you are right on top of it, it doesn't project any heat."
3,Comfort Heater Timer,Although the comfort heater does everything it says it does it takes to much time laying on the floor to work out the timer settings.Then you have to wait in that position to see if you have understood the lenghty instructions.
4,A great heater,"After using this heater for 4 weeks, I am very pleased. It is doing exactly what I want. The automatic feature works as well."
3,Definitely not toasty....,"I live in a 2-story house in Texas where the winters are not all that severe, but I really hate all the heat in the house to fill up the stairwell and leave the tile floor in the family room cold as an ice rink. I researched the space heaters and decided this one would do the trick for our size room without being too pricey, but I was wrong..... It barely takes the chill off the room, and it takes hours to warm up even on ""continuous."" One of the reasons I picked this one is that the reviews said it was quiet, and they were right. It doesn't make a single sound, and you wouldn't know it was on if it wasn't for the yellow light! But I think I will return it and get an upright with a fan. This just isn't what I expected."
4,"Safe, Attractive and Quiet","I use the heater in my basement office. The safety features were important. Setting the automatic off switch was relatively easy. I have configured the desk area to retain the heat before eventually escaping to other parts of the basement. Temps that on certain days are as low as 61 degrees can be raised to a comfortable 68 degrees in the office area, The heater takes the chill off."
2,Let's face it: the technology isn't there,"Just a heads up: The expectations of the ordinary citizen regarding space heaters are out-of-line with what the industry can deliver. I live in a drafty, if beloved, Victorian, and have tried 4-5 space heaters, including this one. It just can't be done. At least not by electric heaters. The only thing is a roaring fireplace, and lacking that, a kerosene-drinking heater."
2,Thermostat Broken,"Would be a great space heater, but it decides (for reasons unknown to me) to go MAX HEAT regardless of temp. setting and after my daughter woke up in her small room with a temp register of 90 degrees, I figured it was trash time."
1,Thermostat unreliable,"The thermostats are not reliable on these digital baseboard models. This was my second one that broke. You find yourself waking up - or worse your baby or kids waking up - to an 85 - 95 degree room sweating! The first one began doing this after not even a year of weekly use. I bought a second and it now does this also, fries us to 92 degrees when the thermostat is clearly set to 70. We've tried everything, unplugging and resetting the thermostat, but this Honeywell HZ-519 still heats up and up and up. Not recommended. Not reliable. A shame because it's nice and quiet and we like the way it heats. Go for the non-digital model if you can find them anywhere."
1,don't buy,"Bought two, within 6 months neither one works, probably the safety tip over switch. Of course they use propriatary screws so I can't even get into it to try and fix. Instead of a tip over safety issue they became a trip over safty issue. Waste of money, wish I could have returned them to Home Depot.DO NOT BUY"
1,Gets HOT - not safe for kids,I bought this thinking we could put it in our child's bedroom to keep it warm as it does not heat up that well. It was nice in that it had a digital temperature gauge and easily could be plugged in on cold nights and removed from the room on nights it was not needed. We tried it out prior to putting it in his room and the grate on top is metal and gets VERY hot. Not sure why they wouldn't have put something over it so it could not be touched but we had to return it. The seller was great and easy to work with but you do not getting shipping refunded and have to pay to ship it back as well. Would avoid this product if you have young children.
1,The heater that doesn't heat,Don't buy this product. We purchased based on a news clip we saw from Consumer Reports. We were looking for a silent heater for the family room. It does not effectively heat the room. You only notice the heat when you are a couple of inches away.
2,Still Chilly,"I bought this item for my wife's home office as a Christmas present. Small issue, but it did not arrive in an Amazon box, appearing instead in a Honeywell box with a picture of the interior emblazoned on the side so the secret was out and now I'm down one Christmas present. (A substitute will follow!)That said, I adopted the heater into my home workshop, throwing out the old one which seemed on its last legs. I'm sorry I did.This room is unheated and is built of concrete without internal insulation. Even so, the old heater took the edge off the cold within 1/2 hour. The new Honeywell heater which is 3 times the size takes at least an hour and a half to raise the temperature from 48 to 60 and after 8 hours the temperature does not increase from 63 even though the unit was set to 75. I would return it but I've already tossed the box. Maybe I'll find a way still."
1,Stopped working after two months,"I purchased this Honeywell Baseboard Heater for a small bedroom in our house where the temperature is, on average, about 10 degrees cooler than the rest of the house during the winter months. I began using this heater in late-October 2012 overnight (an average of 8-9 hours per night) with the thermostat set at 69-70 degrees Fahrenheit. It did a good job of sufficiently warming the room...for a little over two months. I turned the heater on a few days ago (January 7, 2013) and it never warmed up. There's $90 down the hopper."
2,Difficult to use!,"While highly rated by Consumer Reports, this heater is a pain to use on a daily basis. It's not easy to read the digital screen; you need really good lighting to set this thing.Also, because it has no memory, it resets to high heat every time it shuts off. [It would be like a manual control knob that jumps to the highest setting on its own accord.] Hard to convey what a hassle this is.I will say, that once in operation, it does heat nicely. Let's see if Amazon is cooperative in accepting this as a return."
3,Does a good job,"Received heater, plugged in, works fine , using to heat a 12x18 room with attached bathroom, not toasty, but adequate, supplement with a blower heater for shower times."
4,good deal,"good price, bought as an extra for bedroom and works better than expected. The only downside would be no fan but for an open area works just great."
4,Cozy Warm,B4 I make any purchase I check out Consumer Reports. This heater came in as one of the top rated quietest heaters available. It works perfectly. The only draw back is that it doesn't have a low setting.
4,Good quiet heater,"A very quiet and warm space heater, I use it near our bed at night and it does the job well."
5,honeywell HZ519 heater,Very pleased with this product...highly recomended by [consumer products]...heater has preformed to perfection...instructions for the dummy make it simple to operate and it dose what i needed...have recomended this heater to several friends and i know of two who have bought same...they are as pleased as i am...enjoyed doing business with you and will be ordering other products...many thanks
1,Diappointed,We were rather disappointed in this product. It didnt put out nearly the heat that we thought it would. And would have sent it back if it hadn't been for the shipping and restocking fee. It wouldn't have been worth the trouble and costs.
3,"OKAY, not great","First off.. ordered this product and when I received it all of the plastic was completely cracked. Returned it and reordered a second one. The product heating is ""okay."" If the room is medium sized it really doesn't do much. In a small room completely sealed off it could supplement decently but for the price I expected much more... My radiant oil filled heaters keep temperature much better than this. I'm not sure if we are going to keep it or just return it and get a cheaper, more effective oil filled radiant.Pros:Temperature controls""Hot"" indicator on the grateCons:Very hot to the touchMust reset temperature every time you turn it onMust watch temperature as it sometimes changes your settings on its ownBelow average temperature management in a roomFlimsy plastic and packagingCost"
2,patience,Very disappointed! This product was bought for a small sun-porch area with brand new weatherized windows. We turned it on and it took one hour to heat 10 degrees and two hours to heat it to the 68 degrees-our desired temperature. This just was too long to wait to heat this room up. It also does not have a timer feature for turn on if we wanted to have it warm ahead of time. We were not willing to keep it on all the time either. Use this heater in a room that doesn't require heating.
4,"Good heater, awkward design","I bought this heater for a spare bedroom. The quiet, and ability to set the thermostat to an exact temperature was a big selling point for me. This unit does a good job of taking the chill out of the air. However, don't expect it to quickly blow out volumes of hot air and heat an entire room within two-minutes. I like the fact that it is completely quiet, and doesn't off-gas any strange smells (like the Delonghi Mica Panel Radiator). However, since it is a baseboard design, you have to get down on the floor with a flashlight to see and adjust the display, which has no light. A remote control would be a good improvement. Although this unit is very lightweight and has a low, long profile, it is still fairly large and doesn't exactly disappear, if you get my drift. Overall, I am pleased with the job it does."
5,Powerfull little heater,"This is a great heater, I got it for my girl friend who's room is in a cold basement. I never looked forward to having to endure her freezing room when I came to visit, so we got this heater and now her place is like sauna compared to before. I would highly recommend this heater."
2,Dead after 1 winter,"I would have given this heater a great review during the first winter of use. But after putting it away for the summer, it no longer worked correctly when we tried it again. First the positives (assuming yours will work): It is completely quiet, it is low profile so it can be placed against a wall or floor board, the thermostat option is nice because you can set it for a certain temperature and it will turn itself on and off to maintain that temperature. HOWEVER, once we plugged ours back in the second winter, it would no longer keep to a certain temperature. No matter what we set it to, it would just get hotter and hotter. It took us several times of coming into our daugher's room to find the temep in there at 91 degrees before we realized it wasn't working and would no longer regulate itself. BOTTOM LINE: If you get one that works, it's a good heater. But if you don't get one that works, you're going to pay a lot of money for one season of heating."
3,Great until Viola turns on him,"I really liked this novel, Viola sounded so sweet & believable, and Ferdinand was a real gem. Everything seemed to be going so well for them, especially when they finally ""get together,"" but Viola gets so incredibly mean!! I mean, telling Ferdinand he doesn't know how to satisfy her with his inexperience, come on! Viola shared so much with Ferdinand and he was so easy to talk to, I found it hard to believe that she would reject him this way. I found it even harder to believe that he would continue to come back to her after she was so abusive. If the tables were turned, I wonder if readers would have been so understanding of a man speaking to a woman in such a way."
3,Not the worst book I've read...,"This book started great, in fact the whole first half was pretty good, but after they get together nothing goes right. She can't make up her mind and he's just not man enough I guess. The last couple of chapters were terrible she didn't have a good enough reason for her decisions and why would her mom and siblings have to live with her uncle if she has her own house and her mother had once been a mistress! What's she(her mother) objecting to. Too many unanswered questions for me."
3,Good but not as good as Balogh can be,"Boy it hurts to express anything but pure Joy at finding another Balogh treasure. Never really could care about these characters despite greatly admiring the female heroine. Somehow I never saw chemistry click between these two, nor did I see a chance for Ferdinand to truly develop in ""his"" story. I'm off to find Angeline Dudley's story if it exists."
1,BORING,"I cannot believe this author is the same who wrote ""More Than A Mistress"". Where is the tension and plot? This book is so boring that I couldn't even finish it. I don't like either of the main characters because they are not suitably matched. I hate weak men!!"
2,What the heck?,REALLY strange bad read. I love the first half of the book. Both characters delightful. Then we find out Viola secret. Not one I thought was that Viola was the Earl's [...] and things go down hill from there. Viola turns mean and nasty. Ferdinand can't talk sense to her. He offers to give her home back not good enough for her. He offers to marry and protect her with his family's name still not good enough. His sister and sister in law come to talk to her STILL not good enough. COME ON!I really don't understand why Ferdinand loved her after she changed. It really made no sense. I like a book with a LOT of drama but it must be believable for me to enjoy it. No Man's Mistress has a sweet ending. It the middle of the book ruins it. This my first book by Mary Balogh. I don't think I will be buying her books for her name. This not the worst book I have read but it's still pretty bad.
2,Heed the warnings!,"I should have checked the reviews on this one before buying. Learned my lesson. Can't buy Mary Jo Putney without doing that anymore. The only reason I'm not giving this story one star is because it was good and kept my interest - until Viola's big reveal. I figured early on that she was a bastard and that it was her natural father who gave her the property. I was not prepared in the least for the wagering whore part - and she was a talented and good one too. Just yuck. My heroines don't have to be virgins, just not... this. And the reason that she was one made no sense at all. Ferdinand was likable enough. Charming, good-looking, sexy, a bit of a naughty fellow growing up. Yet, he was a virgin at 27. I'm sorry this reversal of rake/whore and angel/virgin was nothing but revolting. As a result I quit reading at page 215."
3,Not one of her best,"The story and the content were not up to par for Ms. Balogh. I am such a fan because she rarely disappoints. I guess that makes it harder to enjoy a mediocore offerings like this. The plot is described in the reviews above, so I won't go into details. I will say that Ferdinand and Viola acted out of character throughout the entire story. Viola has spent two years protecting and builing a respectable reputation in a small town, yet allows a strange man to move in with her? Ferdinand spends the last half of the story acting noble and sensitive, yet had no qualms about threatening to throw Viola out of her home at the beginning of the story. Oh well, I enjoyed catching up with Jane and Jocelyn from More Than a Mistress and would have liked to see more of them. Still, even a less than perfect Balogh offering is better than most of the other titles out there. I would recommend waiting to read this in paperback."
2,Unlikely plot leaving me unconvinced.,"I loved More than a Mistress and this is a follow up telling the story of of Ferdinand, the younger brother of the Duke of Tresham. It's quite nice to meet up with Tresham and Jane again, in fact those are the best bits of this book. For me Ms Balogh's attempt to turn the tables and match a male virgin with a female courtesan did not work at all. I disliked the fact that she was forced into prostitution, her mother's complete ignorance of her lifestyle seemed odd to me and then as a grand finale the courtesan (who is pretty notorious amongst the gentlemen of the ton) is reinstated into society...... Um... I don't think so."
1,Not worth the hour,"As the inside flap boldly states, A Man Survives is definitely a novel which breaks away from traditional Russian writing. Unfortunately, it does so with little success. The story of a boy who grows up trying to escape the life that he lives is choppy, rambling, and not at all captivating. I always finish books I start, but it took genuine effort to concentrate on this one for long enough. Spend your time on something better."
4,GREAT RARE CLARENCE!!,"OK first off I'm biased- I helped with this CD on remastering and remixing some of the stuff that never saw the light of day- or was remixed in stereo, so I'm biased but , I must say I love it! I grew up watching the Kentucky Colonels on Sunday morning TV in LA!!I mean -some of it isn't the best of Clarence White granted but, for most people who are just starting their Clarence White experience they will hear just how versatile he was and what was going on around him from 67 -72.Even if you are a hard core Clarence fan this stuff is great! and I must say a lot of ""love"" and attention went into the remastering of these tracks when need be. Please don't be put off by this other review- and no I am not on the record company's (ACE) payroll-"
4,CD Fills a Major Gap,"I've listened to pretty much everything Clarence White recorded. He did a lot in his 29 years, and I find all of it interesting. This fascinating release reveals a transitional 2-year period in Clarence's career as a studio guitarist -- recordings that have been virtually unheard until now. To criticize ""Tuff & Stringy"" as a previous writer did is to miss the point entirely. These recordings will enlighten and entertain any Clarence fan except the terminally narrowminded. Considering that some of the tracks are informal studio demos and ""idea sketches"" from the mid-1960s, the technical quality is unexpectedly good. As for the music, it shouldn't be compared to the Byrds or the Kentucky Colonels. It's neither rock nor bluegrass. This CD fills a major gap, further documenting and demonstrating Clarence's broad musical interests and brilliance."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT-DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"A truly unsatisfying release obviously with no care taken in all aspects (performance, sound, etc.) to the great talent that was Clarence White. You are better off buying albums by the Byrds, Kentucky Colonels, Muleskinner that he performed with."
1,save your money,"Although my son likes the motorcycle, the spiderman does not stay on the bike. It doesnt even fit properly. He gets so frustrated that the Spiderman will not stay on the bike that he just turns to something else. I don't recommend spending your money on this."
2,Wierd,"I bought this album after hearing the track Falling Pianos - which is a fantastic track. But unfortunately, it seems to be the only good track. After listening to the whole album I can't say I'd ever listen to it again. Quite expiremental. Some of the others are okay but I'd pass on this one and just download the mp3 tracks that sound good to you."
1,Don't waste your time with Geneon/Pioneer,Don't buy from Geneon/Pioneer! It's a waste of time and money! You wont get the rest of the season/series from them! Find yourself an Import sorce. It maybe a sub but atleast you'll get the whole season/series.
3,Dictionary could be better,"although my japanese teacher recommended it, I felt that when I was writing a letter to my penpal, i couldn't find many of the words i wanted to use"
1,size L was very very small and does not correspond to reality,"size L was very very small and does not correspond to reality,size L was very very small and does not correspond to reality"
3,A good place to start,"A good overall history of WWII. This was one of the first books that I bought on the subject over 30 years ago, and I have read it many times. The edition I have has well illustrated maps that are easy to follow. This book is definitely for someone starting out on the history of the war. I found the sections on the Japanese conflict very instructive as this was not my main line of interest. However it filled the gaps of my limited knowledge. The book is over 1000 pages long and covers The rise of Hitler to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One could say that this is the most comprehensive one volume concise history om World War II available."
4,The Goodbye Summer,This was another addictive book written by Patricia Gaffney. She created characters that you cared about and wanted to follow to the end of the book and even further. I found myself thinking of the characters long after I had finished the book. The plot was interesting and poignant. Another winner from Ms. Gaffney.
2,I was bored,"I was really looking forward to this book, and totally let down. I loved Saving Graces, but this was a total disappointment to me. It moved so slow, I only got through half of the book. I was bored, so I just simply stopped reading it. Maybe the ending would've made it worthwile, but I wasn't pulled in enough to get there."
1,Don't waste your money - BORING!,"I picked this up in an airport because I loved The Saving Graces and was looking forward to being engrossed in a great novel during a long flight. What a disappointment! This was a long, boring book about a pathetic woman who has all kinds of new experiences over the course of the story but never changes! You'd think that after moving her Grandmother (who she lives with) into a nursing home, finding a boyfriend, getting dumped and having a miscarriage she would learn SOMETHING and develop into a stronger person. That was not the case at all.I was so disappointed in this book that I won't purchase another Patricia Gaffney hardcover."
4,Country Mountain Romance,I like having the instrumental recording of songs with words. Craig Duncan makes the songs relaxing and enjoyable for background listening. I also like the tunes he chose -- many are favorite vocals.
3,Purchased as a gift,"Purchased this as a gift for a young grandaughter who begged, ""buy me all things French!"" Hope this fills the bill, looked age appropriate."
1,Egocentric author who puts little value on Experts,"I thought the author was high on herself and down on anybody with a little knowledge. She presents Knowledge Management with a ""black and white"" attitude. This is right and that is wrong. It's very simple minded conversation about an extremely complex subject matter. Also, she uses generic and vague statements like ""Know who needs to know what in the Orgnaization."" That's obvious, tell me how to do that. What tools, work processes? She doesn't give much details on this. In summary, the book provides very little insight to solving a very complex matter. It's merely a gather of vague, wonderful proverbs!"
3,Best Ponda Boba yet,Do yourself a favor and buy the Vintage version of Ponda Baba instead of this one. It's a lot better and has a removable arm. You can find the vintage version here:Star Wars 3.75 Vintage Figure Ponda Boba
2,WAAAAY overpriced.,"I worked for 4 different national electronics retailers, and I can honestly say that Monster cables are overpriced. 90% overpriced. Every year, they (monster) would have a contest where we could get all the Monster Products we could buy at 90% off, if we sold X amount of product. At 90% off, Monster still made money.The Monster displays at stores are ""calibrated"" by Monster sales reps... NOT store employees. Anyone going to ""calibrate"" the powercenter at home? No. So why can't the stores display it right out of the box? Because then Monster loses it's ""magic"".I got this powercenter for $75 because of said contest... and it's no better than a belkin that sells for $30 (retail price).Interesting side note, run the monster thru the Belkin, the voltage is stable... run the belkin thru the Monster, the voltage fluxes like crazy.Moral of the story... Buy belkin"
1,Avoid at all costs,This was on sale before Christmas for $149. I've had a Monster Power Center for 13 years and it was time to upgrade. Surge protectors should be replaced. The Monster HTS 5100 MK II seemed like the perfect replacement.First one failed in about two weeks. A loud grinding. Noise came from the unit and random outlets would trip off. Called Monster tech support. They said return it to Amazon. Amazon cross shipped a replacement.That that worked for about 2 days before it randomly started tripping outlets. Tried various combinations of what was in different outlets. No go. I believe these units are bad and not worth anything.Amazon has great return policies and are the best part of this experience. I will gladly shop with Amazon but I will never buy Monster again.
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE AND IT DAMAGED MY RECEIVER,This product is complete junk and I will be returning this right away.The worst part is that it blew out my Yamaha A/V receiver and Monster Customer Service is a joke. They wanted me to send the product back to them so they could repair it and said there was no possible way it could have damaged my Yamaha. Now I have to have my Yamaha repaired at my expense. MONSTER HAS LOST MY BUSINESS FOREVER.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF JUNK AND ALL MONSTER PRODUCTS.
3,HTS 5100 Power Center,"Product was delivered as stated and appeared to be working properly. The power center didnt make a big difference, but may be because i was replacing an older power center that stopped working after about ten years."
1,Less than I anticipated from Monster/No Longer a fan,"I bought this product less than 2 years ago, and suddenly stopped working. I have tried to ask Monster what to do with it, and after 4 e-mails, and leaving 3 voice mails, no one has yet to call me, or answered my e-mails. It is very disappointing to see this type of customer service from a company that is based in USA, and in every type of media they introduce themselves as having very high quality products, therefore the high prices(When I bought this product 2 years ago, the market price was over 500 dollars). I am a huge supporter of USA companies, but when they treat you like this, it is hard for anyone to stay loyal.Dr. Robert ShahDallas, Texas"
1,Short Life Span,"I have had this power center for just under 5 years and all of a sudden my audio/video components would shut off and stay off for a few minutes and then come back on. This was not due to any type of incoming power probem to the unit. The power coming in was clean and stable. The unit just died shortly after that. As the other review said....""not worth the price"". Get a Belkin instead."
2,Broken After 2 Weeks,"I read other reviews here about folks having problems with this product, but wrote them off. That was a mistake. I got this item on sale, so I didn't pay nearly as much as other folks here, but it broke after just a couple weeks. Suddenly it would start losing power to some of its outlets, then turn them on and off randomly - even when set to unswitched. I'm going to end up RMA'ing it to Monster Power, but I can't recommend this product to anyone else."
1,Celestial Heaven,I enjoy New Age music that can take my soul for a journey through the stars. This is one of my favorite CDs for relaxing.
5,Elegant and Sublime,"As a long time fan of Jonn Serrie, I am very happy that he has returned to his ""roots"" of cosmic space music after his brief sojourn into more ""earthy"" music that he did on Spirit Keeper, etc.This premier artist of cosmic music that is used worldwide at Planetariums is reknown for his floating, ethereal music that allows one to dissolve into bliss as an instant fix for tension and stress particularly at the end of a teeth grinding day. On this CD, Jonn has created some of his most elegant and sublime music to date.Favorites: #2 ""Eye of the Beholder"" is achingly gorgeous; #4 ""Pan Galactic"" is stunning and #5 ""The Stars,like Dust"" is like really being out there floating around the cosmos in an imaginary starship like Enterprise or Voyager. An amazing CD from an amazing artist who will always remain my #1 favorite of all time."
5,Worth their weight in gold,"These get-a-grips are incredible. They allow you to walk, run, skip and hop on ice without falling, slipping or sliding. One note: they don't buy you much on snow, and they're not formed to go over heels of any great height. The medium size fits well over boots that run from a woman's size 6 through a man's size 9, and they take a little stretching to get on the first time. I leave them on an older pair of boots rather than put them on and off each time I need them. They should come off before you go inside, as they could harm carpeting or flooring. My son borrowed a pair from me when he had to shovel off a roof during this miserable winter. He told me he started to slide off the roof in the snow, but stopped short when he hit the ice. Highly, highly recommended. If you have older relatives, buy them each a pair. It's a lot cheaper than a broken bone."
5,Fantastic grips.,I have owned a pair of Get-A-Grips for the past 4 or 5 years. They finally started to wear out and I needed to buy another set.These are perfect.
1,DON NOT BUY!,This lamp gets very very hot! Made in China. Frame was bent when I received it. Very bad fit and finish. I cannot overstate how hot this lamp gets. I should have purchased a led lamp. Don't waste your money on this. This lamp is worth $15 at most.
5,Lamp works great!,"This lamp is stylish, efficient and works very well as a bedside lamp. I bought it because it has a dimmer switch and has a low light level that is easy on the eyes."
1,Lamp did not work out for me,"I purchased this lamp for my home office desk. When I opened the carton, it appeared to me that some of the white foam packing had got too hot and the power cord had white residue all over it, so I had to scrub that off before even trying out the lamp. The halogen bulb burn't out after one half hour use, a complaint another reviewer had also made. When it was still working, even at the highest brightness setting, it did not cover my whole desk area, and I had to move things closer to read them clearly. Also,it throws off a tremendous amount of heat, and the desk area directly below the lamp's light got quite warm. I returned the item."
3,lamp Ok Bulb Not,Bulb overheated and blew after just a few hours use. I bought a smaller wattage bulb - 75W - so far so good.
5,Arch Design Dark Bronz Halogen Desk Lamp,"This is an excellent desk lamp with some great features. First, the light is very bright. Second, with two well placed levers--one on the base and one on the lamp head--the height and angle of the lamp can be adjusted to meet your reading needs. Third, the intensity of the light can be adjusted with a dimmer switch. Fourth, the lamp is solidly built. Fifth, it is an attractive lamp that fits in nicely in a home office. This lamp is well worth the $99.00 price tag. I highly recommend it !!!!!!!"
2,Love this lamp after I fixed it.,"The lamp is great. It has a nice non-obtrusive design that fits on any desk. I am particular fond of the adjustable light intensity. However, it arrived bend. It was not a transport problem, it rather appeared to be a production problem. The aluminum light-bulb holder was bend and sticking out of the casing. Nothing one cannot fix, but who wants to disassemble a brand new lamp?! I heard their customer support is pretty rude and useless, so I never bothered wasting time contacting them and fix the lamp myself.5 stars for a good lamp -3 for production and customer support"
2,Light gets way too hot,"Positive: Very bright and is dimmable. This desk lamp looks nice.Negatives: Halogen is way too hot. Since this is a desk lamp, the light is close to the desk surface. So it heats up the desk surface and puts out heat making a person sitting at the desk a bit warm. Also was pricey. The stickers that came on the desk left marks when I removed them. Also the original halogen bulb burned out in just a few hours.Would not buy again, and I would have returned this one if I had not procrastinated."
4,Ever heard of The Lazlo Letters?,"I haven't read ""Letters from a Nut"" yet, but from the description it sounds pretty funny. I only have one question for everyone who marvels at the ""originality"" of this material. Didn't *anyone* here read ""The Lazlo Letters""?? Don Novello did this schtick (and did it damn well) 10 years ago! I'm shocked that no one has even mentioned this, much less suggested (as I will) that Novello (aka Lazlo Toth, aka Father Guido Sarducci of SNL fame) is also Ted Nancy."
1,"Boring, repetitive and not funny","This book was boring, repetitive and, for the most part, not funny. I don't know how it made it into print given that there are several other books with a similar premise authored by other writers that are substantially better. I'm surprised that Jerry Seinfeld put his name to this book. Is Ted L. Nancy a cousin... or possibly Jerry himself?"
1,I laughed until I stopped,"It's been done before in the Henry Root Letters and it was done a whole lot better. Some of those were funny. I appreciate that this may be a US v. UK sense of humour thing but if the Yanks think that writing to a circus pretending to be a midget or to a hotel and saying you left a ceremonial sword in the toilets (sorry, ""bathroom"") is thigh slappingly funny, then one can only pity them."
5,Ted L. Nancy is a genius and inspiration!,Ted L. Nancy is a genius and inspiration. To proudly display his desire to see the world and share with others in spite of so many hurdles shows courage and determination we all could learn from.
4,If you liked this!!!!!,Try books by Lazlo Toth (aka Don Novello) who didit first. His Lazlo letters are classics.
2,reruns,starts off funny but ends up so repetitive. the description lead me to believe it was different writers being rejected. disappointed.
2,A Derivative Work That Doesn't Succeed,"Other reviewers indicated that they laughed themselves silly over this book. I found Mr. Nancy's book to be mildly amusing at best, and generally tedious. Why? The secret to a successful book in this genre, as other authors such as Rosa and Novello have found, is to write silly letters that make the recipients swallow them hook, line and sinker, and respond with a letter thats almost as funny as the author's. Nancy doesn't have this talent. Many letters go without reply, or are answered with curt form letters. This makes the joke fall flat. We can all write stupid letters, but if we can't catch the victim in our trap what's the use? Don't waste your money on the second book in this series; instead go out and buy one of the other similar books by authors who know how to do the job properly."
5,Hee hee hee hee,I love this book! I've read it several times over and it's always great for a laugh. Ted L. Nancy operates out of Thousand Oaks CA which is near where my parents live. I'll have to stop by to say hi sometime.
4,Very funny,"I enjoyed this book very much. It was a fun, unique, and very humorous read. Highly recommended."
4,Some VERY funny material,"Let me start by saying: I get where some of the negative reviews are coming from. There is a lot of repetition in LFAN. This sort of thing has been done before. Some of the gags don't quite work. Few of the respondants really ""fell"" for the gags. In spite of all of this, however, LFAN did have me laughing out loud...a lot. Being no fan of spoilers, I won't highlight any of my favorite lines here. Suffice it to say, there are some extremely funny letters in this collection. If you're not howling after 10 minutes, put the book down. It won't get better. The humor's not for you. If you are howling after 10 minutes, read on! There's plenty more where that came from..."
5,If you want to laugh....,"This is the first of three books, of which I have read all, and they are all equally as hysterical!! The letters are ingenious, creative, and just down right priceless. Of course some of them are stupid, you can't have every single one of them hit right on. I guarantee you will laugh!! more then once! Makes you want to write one of your own!"
2,Lazlo is King.,"First, to not acknowledge ""The Lazlo Letters"" is flat out wrong. Second, if you've read ""Lazlo"" you will find ""Letters from a Nut"" to be second rate. How many times can he write to a hotel asking permission to bring along an object like a desk, sink, tub, bed, etc. The responses are identical. Very mediocre."
3,Jerry Seinfeld is Ted L. Nancy,"Jerry Seinfeld is obviously the author! Every letter displays his unique sense of humour. His ""story"" in the introduction about ""finding"" the letters at a party is ludicrous! Anyway, I found the book to be quite entertaining, although many letters were somewhat boring. Often, however, a letter would come that would knock your socks off! A good example of that would be the one about his costume on the bus (I won't say more). In any case, it's a fun read."
2,Mixed Emotions,"It's a funny premise, and there are certainly some hilarious letters. But, there is far too much repetition of ideas - that gets old. And I could not help thinking that hard-working folks had to waste their valuable time answering this nonsense."
3,Not as inventive as other books of its type,"Jerry Seinfeld's (c'mon, we know it's him) book of letters to corporate America, while funny in many places, is not as inventive as other books of this type. Many of his letters are similar to others in the book. How many times do we need to read about Ted Nancy's predicaments with things he likes to bring to hotels. Instead of putting all of them in, he should have picked the one with the funniest letter and/or response. Idiot Letters, the Lazlo Letters, and Outrageously Yours are much funnier, and sadly, probably haven't sold as well."
5,nutty letters,"Letters from a nut By: Ted L. NancyI think this book is good because it shows letters that Ted L. Nancy wrote to stores, and famous people like Al Gore some of the letters are so funny that you will enjoy them. Like in one of his letters he wrote to the President of mars candy. He says that he could taste what kind of candy with his eyes closed. There are letters for most of the store that you go to. I think if you read this book that you will like it a lot."
3,Waste of money,Would not waste my money on any other books by this author. Hope he has made enough on this book as he won't be selling anymore to me anyway!
5,Don't miss this book,I can pick this book up anytime and laugh. I've had it since sometime in the 90's. The best book of the bunch.
5,Hillarious book. Pray for a sequel. Seinfeld? at his best.,"If Ted Nancy is a psuedonym for Jerry Seinfeld or not, this book is by far one of the funniest I've read in a while. Absurd letters to hotels, casinos, airlines, and more... Look for letters like one to a casino regarding weather or not this ""Mr. Ted Nancy"" would be allowed to bring his own soda vending machine into his hotel room... or if Hanes Co. would be interested in a new 6-day pair of underwear invention with three leg-holes. Then read the serious responses from the companies he wrote to. Most fun to read out loud to friends. Steer clear of the one tedious chapter of ""Thank You letters"" but enjoy all the rest. Would Greyhound let a time-pressed actor wear his foam costume shaped like a stick of butter on board? Believe it or not... Yes! Definitely one you won't want to put down."
4,Comedy Fever,"I loved this book! My teacher read my class this book. It's all about the author (Ned L Nancy) writing stupid letters to hotels, casinos, fancy places etc. He wrote to one hotel saying he was a midget who needed special room furniture. He also wrote to the lost in found building saying he lost a tooth and wanted it back. He also wrote a letter to the Ritz saying he had a bedwetting problem! If you like comedy I would definitely recommend this book!"
3,Dead copy of Don Novello's (Father Guido Sarducci) books,"A series of books of this type was done first (and better) by Don Novello (Father Guido Sarducci of Saturday Night Live fame) who used alter ego Lazlo Toth - a rather strenuous and hilariously conservative American Patriot - to lampoon people like Lee Iacocca and other well known figures using letters which are just over the line of rational thought. The responses he received back (sometimes form letters which could play perfectly into the joke and sometimes personal letters) are displayed on the opposing page. If Mr. Novello hadn't died several years ago I would imagine he was behind this. Amazon has these books - I would suggest this one as a start:The Lazlo Letters: The Amazing, Real-Life, Actual Correspondence of Lazlo Toth, American!by Don Novello (Paperback - May 1992)"
2,Others have done it better,"Letters From a Nut and More Letters From a Nut have their moments, but for some REALLY hilarious crank letters, you've got to try Idiot Letters, Dear Ernest and Julio, and the classics, The Lazlo Letters and Citizen Lazlo."
2,Didn't even finish the book,"I don't know why this book was recommended so highly by others but I found it mostly boring. I really enjoyed ""The Lazlo Letters"" and even added it to my permanent library. The concept in ""Letter from a Nut"" is virtually identical to ""The Lazlo Letters"". Unfortunately it is missing some sort of spark that TLL had. I'm utterly amazed that this book even got published and expect it was largely due to the introduction by Jerry Seinfield (the author might be Seinfield himself, but I would expect it to be a better book if he wrote it.) Anyway, I read a little over half the book and stopped reading it because it seemed a little too repetitive to me. I also bought the sequel to this book and I'll probably thumb through it before donating it/giving it away. I think I saw that there was even a second sequel, which of course I won't be buying."
1,Massive Fail,"I got this to use on a cat between groomings. I followed the directions: rub into fur until fur feels damp, brush through, rub with towel. It smells nice and clean, but that's about the best I can say about it. It was a mess. His hair was all sticky and matted even after it dried. This lead to him cleaning himself incessantly all day, which just resulted in more dander. I'm glad it deodorized him, because he needed it, but the extra dander totally offsets that. I definitely won't be buying this again."
2,What is all the hype about?,What is all the hype about? I found both the performance and the sonics of this recording to be rather run of the mill.
3,Good,"I thought that this cd set was pretty good. I really like select songs and I cannot hear the cds all the way through. CD 1 was my favorite. I go for more songs done by Gigi D'Agostino instead of the remixes or whatever. For me, some of the songs are awesome and some just dont have enough zest. You'll like it if you dont mind remixes, trance music, and 1980's kinda music."
4,Genuis,This album makes Gigi look so good. If you listen to the first CD he uses other artist's music in the first several tracks. When you get to Gigi there is a dramatic change in the quality of the music. Interesting concept.
3,right to brag,It's not great but pretty good.The best matches were The Ironman match and the John-Miz which stole the show in my mind.The 4 way World's title match was a solid match for a 4 way but it was also too short.The Bragging Rights Tag Match was confusing and caused many of the wrestlers to get lost in the action.The Six Divas tag team match was ok. I give this event a 6 out of 10.
5,Life's too short for a book this comprehensive!,"I've seen dozens of volunteer books, adventure-job books, online databases, etc., but this is still my favorite. While some other places may contain more addresses, and yet others more information on each contact, this achieves the perfect balance. Hundreds of exciting jobs await, many well-paying and many volunteer. I've spent countless hours browsing this book dreaming and have used it for one job so far (at an out-of-the-way resort in Olympic National Park).The chapters are divided usefully into sections on artistic pursuits, overseas jobs, environmental jobs, adventure jobs, farming jobs, etc., and are peppered with helpful anecdotes from people who've been there. The only drawback, as others have noted, is that the vast majority of listings are US-based. So if you wish to find more non-American jobs, try somewhere else, otherwise this is the best place to start dreaming AND doing!"
1,Very poor adaptation,"I've been watching nearly all Pride and Prejudice movies and my favorite so far is still the Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle's. Unfortunately this 1980 edition is very pale in comparison to the other adaptations. The dialogues are not faithful to the book and the portrayal of the characters are quite off. Fortunately, this is just a library loan. I would hate to spend my money on this piece."
2,It's okay. Definitely not my favorite.,"This version is ""okay."" Just okay. It is from 1980 and the interior lighting is overly harsh and the exteriors are fine but come as a shock. Mr Darcy (David Rintoul) is icy, prideful, aloof -- so totally believable -- but Elizabeth Garvey as Elizabeth Bennet was somewhat lacking, as she did not show any charisma or anything that would make her a stand out to the likes of a Mr. Darcy. (I almost agree with Miss Bingley's opinions of this Elizabeth, ""For my part, I confess I could never see any beauty in her...."")Some of the dialogue was played with, having other characters say the words. Usually with adaptations, I don't mind this if it serves for flow or continuity, but it seemed to serve no purpose. I enjoy anything P&P; and was glad to see this version, but,it won't be one I watch over and over again. I'd rent it unless you are like me, and just have to have your own copy regardless."
2,A&E was better,"I love Pride and Prejudice...both the book and movie, but I was less than impressed with this version....did not feel the romance, the flair. Garvie is beautiful..yes, but she is prettier than the Jane character...it is not to be so. hated Darcy character...no life, no soul...in trying to be proud, he killed the character.... very wooden. Just did not leave with a satisfied feeling at all. The A&E version though inconvenient being on 6 tapes...much better....of course I forgive the inconvenience because it was a mini-series."
3,Well made brittish television theater,"I have watched four adaptations of Jane Austens book ""Pride and Prejudice"" and I must say that every version has its charm. There are also a number of classic scenes that each adaptation does better than all the others. This version should be mostly for hardcore Austen lovers than seekers of screen romance, I think. It is rather faithful to the book, in dialogue and casting - I don't think any other Darcy I've seen has been prouder than this. He is so proud that it is slightly unbelievable that Lizzie should detect his love, but she is a clever girl and she does and through inner monologue makes sure the audience also gets it. I will certainly watch it many times!"
1,Too much of the one thing can be bad for you !,"I am not being critical of the Pride and Predjudice version that is under review I think it is a great video. But if you have seen one you have seen them all. I suppose I am a bit prejudice, but I first saw the version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and I fell in love with characters. i have seen that version alot of times and i just got used to the characters being the way they were, i saw the new version to see how much it had changed and if it would change my views on Pride and Prej as a story, but it didn't. I didn't warm to the characters as much cause i expected them to be the same. Anyway If I had not seen the Colin Firth Version first I would be as in love with the new version as I am with the old. i think it was great work and Elizabeth Garvie did a great job, along with the supporting actors and crew."
1,Pride and Prejudice ~ Marsha Fitzalan,Okay movie...poor film quality. Later remakes are much better.
2,Don't put your faith in reviews,"After reading the review which claimed that this version was much more true to the book than the A&E version, I purchased it. I couldn't wait to get home to watch it!All I can say is, I don't know which book this film is so true to, but it is definitely not Pride and Prejudice! Many pivotal scenes and a lot of dialogue were either eliminated or altered so that they lacked the emotion and the humor that Jane Austen had so brilliantly crafted. The casting was appalling and the performances were wooden.Except for the fact that Elizabeth and Jane were a bit more conventionally pretty in this adaptation, the A & E version beats it hands down in every other category. When you watch that version, it's almost like reading the book.If you have to buy one film adaptation of the novel, buy the A&E version. Then you won't be disappointed as I was.But, as I said, don't put your faith in reviews! To each his own! To me, Colin Firth!"
2,1980s version vs. 1995 version,"I just saw the 1980s bbc version after having seen the 1995 version and rereading the book, and it is almost not fair to compare the two movies. The screen writing and direction for the 1995 version is just so much more sophisticated. A very typical example: at the party at Sir Lucas' house toward the beginning of the novel, we have the scene where Elizabeth observes that Darcy is listening to her conversation and she teases him for it. In the 1980s version, Darcy is standing all the way across a rather large and crowded room from her,and she has to wind her way over to him and say something like, ""did I not just express myself uncommonly well just now,"" or something like that. It made no sense at all. I also agree with a previous reviewer who noted that Kitty looked to be about 40 in the 1980s version. I could go on and on..."
3,Better Versions to Watch,Althought this version has the wonderful costumes and large amounts of Jane Austen's beautiful dialogue (althought not necessarily said by the characters who uttered them in the novel) it is still not my favorite version. The main reason... I don't like their Mr. Darcy. The trick is creating the cold and aloof Darcy who is really shy and caring underneath. They have the cold and aloof part and that is all. Whether poor directing or poor acting or a combination of both... this version just never warmed my heart. I found it hard to believe Elizabeth would ever find anything redeeming in this Mr. Darcy. Grab one of the many other lush versions (A&E is excellent) and enjoy that instead.
3,Missing Key P&P Ingredient: Colin Firth,"Although my title is a bit tongue in cheek, this version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is not quite as fulfilling as the BBC version starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth that would come a decade and a half later. If you love the regency era, however, you'll enjoy looking at the costumes and sets. And it's a satisfying visual adventure for any P&P lover. The sets do seem a bit cramped, as if it's Longbourne in a sound stage instead of just Longbourne, but, of course, I was spoiled with the cinematography of the BBC version before I watched this. If this is your first Pride and Prejudice movie experience, skip it and try the BBC version or the Kiera Knightley version (if you don't have six hours) first. But for the lover of all things P&P, it's a must-see."
3,a Jane Austen classic,"Pride and Prejudice is a Jane Austen classic, and probably her most popular and most-loved work. This film is a very nicely done version, but it is difficult to truly dissect and rate this particular version after seeing the Andrew Davies version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Colin Firth portrayed on-screen the quintessential Darcy that Jane Austen had in mind, in my opinion. He managed to play a gentlemen of few words, with a stern countenance, who was drop-dead gorgeous and filthy rich. His Darcy cannot be compared to any other, which makes it difficult to really enjoy any other film versions of Pride and Prejudice.This version has merit, though, as the actors were well-cast,unknown to most of us,but played well their parts. The scenery and screenplay were well-done, but the Davies version is still tops in my opinion."
5,The Best,This version is simply the best of them. Elizabeth Garve is superb. This is the one that I enjoy rewatching every couple of years. I think Austen would have been very happy with this production.
5,Pride and Prejudice,I spin wool into yarn on a spinning wheel and drop spindle everyday. So when I'm spinning I watch/listen to movies. I love Jane Austen and have watched several movies on PBS and thought this would be a great movie to watch/listen to while I was spinning. I truely enjoyed watching it while I was spinning and hope to buy another one of these movies soon.
2,Don't Waste Your Money.,"Don't waste your money. Spend a few extra dollars and buy the more recent A&E version. This version looks as if it was made in someone's basement. The production values are nil and the acting is wooden. There are a few nice moments toward the end, and if there were no other version available, I might recommend it more. The A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, is superb. I especially recommend the DVD with a featurette on the making of Pride and Predjudice."
1,"I beg to differ with you, but...","I found this adaptation lacking. I failed to see any real emotion portrayed by any of the characters, and especially that of Mr. Darcy. What a stone face!I enjoyed the A&E version of P&P so much that I watched it 3 times the first weekend I saw it. I have since considered it the most excellent movie of my acquaintance!"
1,I can not finish watching more than 20 minutes,"I am spoiled by the A&E version. It has Jane Austin's spirit. A true enjoy. As a matter of fact, that is my all time favorite. This BBC one is unspeakable. Just read the reviews that has one star, I agree with all of them. I even think that 20 minutes is a waste of my time. If you never read the book, you would never think this movie is intended to be a romance, never a comedy."
1,Butt numbingly dull,"I had to write a book report on P&P.; Since I'm lazy, I thought watching the movie would made my work easier. Wow, did I learn my lesson! This is the most boring movie I have ever seen and surprisingly made by BBC which I always think it's the best in making period movies.Who are those actors? Most of them, especially young ones, seems like have no acting training at all. They all say their line in a fast, monotone voice. And what's with this Darcy guy? Even when he is speaking, not an inch of his face moves. And did he have neck injury? When he turns his head, he always turns his whole upper body.Besides the aweful acting, the directing, editing and everything else are no good either. In the end, it's a total waste of 4 hours and totally put me off the idea of reading the book and writing the report. I did on Oliver Twist instead."
4,This version of Pride & Prejudice was pretty good,"The DVD worked perfectly, was brand new, and I liked this Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth better than Colin Firth & Jennifer Elthe from the A & E version...Liked the newest version with Keira Knightly and, the very handsome Micheal McFaydden better than all the rest..that version Is by far the most romantic, and the scenery breathtaking.."
3,"Pride and Prejudice, early BBC miniseries","It's okay, but I didn't like many of the actors in their parts. The two main sisters should've switched parts and the series editted to pick up the pace. The book isn't boring, but I found this series to be so quite often. Yes, it stayed true to the book for the most part, but that isn't always a good thing, as this production shows.Not worth buying, see if your library has it. Mine does now, as I gave my copy to them. I was curious about previous versions until I watched them."
3,I have several versions,"I have several versions and this is my least liked. Whether it's the people or the acting or the direction, I could never get into this movie."
4,comparisons to P and P,"Ok on regards to this version, I honestly did not think that this Mr. Darcy was charming or handsome at all. I prefered Colin Firth and Matthew Mcfayden from the most recent version starring Keira Knightly. I will say Keira was far too pretty for the role but as Ms Bingley would say, Tolerable enough. I found that David Rintoul from this 80s version played his role way to snobbish for my taste and Colin Firth did not, nor did Matthew McFayden. So I enjoyed this version very much but choose to stay with Colin Firth's version and Keira Knightly's version. It may also be that I am a very big romantic and the more the romance the better."
4,pride and prejudice,The movie is the greatest for all the details- The remakes after this all vary on the theme and leave stuff out.This DVD is a 2 sider and i do not like that- I was not expecting that - seems cheaply done for such a nice classic
5,Spectacular!!!,"I love this movie!!!! The dvd had scenes that were not in my VHS tape! This is a timeless story, and although there have been other productions of this wonderful book, in my opinion, this is the best one made. Sticks the closest to the novel. I highly recommend this."
1,Lacking in Energy and humor,"One of the things I love about Pride and Prejudice is the wit/humor in it -- this version seems to suck the life and humor right out of the story. Propriety is one thing, but some of Austen's characters are intentionally over the the top, and so I think it's fitting that in other versions the characters express that energy and sense of humor. Here they are just dry, and while the script doesn't eliminate all of the humor, it's delivered so poorly as to fall completely flat."
4,"Better Elizabeth & Darcy than 96, not such a good production","This production is not so lavish as the 96 version, and does not have quite the same drive. However Elizabeth Garvie as Lizzie, and David Rintoul as Darcy are far better than their 1996 counterparts (Colin Firth attempting to look moody looks like Colin Firth looking constipated). Incidentally both this version and the '96 version were BBC versions, the latter with production money contributed by A&E."
2,Bought this unintentionally,"I bought this in high school after reading (and LOVING) the novel and watching watching clips from what my teacher called ""the BBC miniseries."" I didn't realize that the version we saw was actually the A&E/BBC version, and bought this one by accident. What a disappointment! Yes, as many people have pointed out, it is very accurate. However, when I read the book, I felt like the characters were alive, but did not feel that at all when I watched this version. Needless to say, it hasn't come out of its case since that afternoon of disappointed viewing."
4,"Very good, a must for P&P fans","I have only seen the old P&P with Greer Garson, et al. so when my sister loaned me this video I was surprised and delighted. So much more true to the book. I thought the lead actors were superb and although Mr. Darcy was wooden and stiff, I believe that is the way the character was in the book. I found his facial expressions revealed so much more than his words. It really is more like a play than a movie and should be viewed in that style as theatre and movies are two different things!!! I have not yet seen the Colin Firth version and look forward to it, but I recommend this version at least for comparison."
2,"true to novel, but slack in imagination and emotional spark","I rented this mini some time ago, and although it was true to the text, it has some obvious flaws. The pacing is entirely off. There are some downplayed moments that should be poignant, which instead just feel like dead air. Most importantly, the performances leave much to be desired, as the two main characters, Lizzy and Darcy, are barely brought to life by the respective actors. I have to admit, my favorite parts of the adaptation were those with Darcy, not because of his character, but because the actor had the uncanny ability to barely open his mouth when brusquely and dully dead-panning his lines. His mouth remains a thin harsh line throughout the entre film, keep watch, you'll see!"
1,Disappointed,"I was never so disappointed in my life. I have seen 3 versions of Pride and Prejudice and this by far is the absolute ruin of them all. The A&E production is awesome,Colin and Jennifer are the best. I couldn't stand to watch this BBC one more than once, it was like drudging through MUD! It's like a small town amateur theater play. Very mundane and hard for me to get into after the one with Colin and Jennifer. No fluency and so choppy and direct, it's like the characters weren't even real............. totally disgusted with this one, and a waste of money."
5,Preferred version,"Maybe because I saw this version first (before the 1996 version), but I prefer this one. The actress that plays Elizabeth is excellent. I like her Elizabeth much better than the 1996 Elizabeth. Although I love Colin Firth (he's a hottie), I like the way that David Rintoul plays Mr. Darcy. He comes off cold at the right times and warms up when he wants to - just as I imagine that Mr. Darcy would. The production isn't as impressive, but if you like P&P, give this version a look.When will they put this on DVD?"
1,Favourite version but it was only a tease!,"I purchased this adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel and was extremely disappointed that I only received 3 episodes in the package. It is supposed to come as a 2 disc set but only received one writable disc and it was of a poor quality. So although I recommend this version as the best adaptation of the novel, I am sorely disappointed with the actual product."
3,Jane Austen,"This adaption was okay; however, it doesn't compare to the later versions. Nevertheless, I am glad I have it in my Jane Austen Library; I feel you get something from each adaption."
4,Another enjoyable rendition,"I am totally in love with all things Pride and Prejudice and am just starting to realize how many films and book variations are out there. I have now seen 3 movies. The Matthew MacFadyen, Colin Firth and David Rintoul as Darcy versions. All have their postives and their negatives. I can't tell you which is best. I love them all. I will say that you must watch them all and judge for yourself. They all bring something different to the screen and put together you get a full enjoyment of the novel."
3,Not my favorite version,"A little drier than some of the other BBC versions. I wish I wouldn't have bought it. I have the 6 hour Colin Firth version, and that one is so much better! Oh well!"
2,This Movie Was Dull.,"I love Jane Austen and I really wanted to like this movie. I've seen the version with Colin Firth, the Bollywood version (Bride and Prejudice), the Mormon version, and the Keira Knightly version. I just couldn't finish the movie. It was so dull. The acting was very wooden and seemed lifeless. I hate to give it a bad review, but I liked it the least of all the versions that I have seen."
3,Ok...I guess,"In this movie showing one of the most loved novels of all time Pride and Prejudice the storyline is good and so are the characters. The sound and color weren't fabulous though. I do like this movie but, I think it's a little outdated. For a newer version check out Pride and Prejudice (1996?) with Colin Firth. I highly reccomend that one."
2,Not the Colin Firth performance!,"I purchased this DVD thinking it was the BBC version I had heard so much about, with Colin Firth. It is not. My mistake, but I should have known what I would get for the price. It's barely OK. Spend some extra cash and get the full version starring Colin Firth. He is the best Darcy ever and that version is nearly a carbon copy of the book. Very well done!"
4,Great movie,"I own this movie, and while i still enjoy watching it occasionally, it's not my favorite anymore as the BBC miniseries with Colin Firth is much better. It's a good movie to own if you can't own the miniseries, and if you've enjoyed watching this, i definitely recommend the miniseries. I also recommend you read the book, nothing depicts Jane Austen's classic like her own writing."
1,I wish I could give it zero stars.,"I couldn't even watch this all the way through. I tried. I really tried. But it is HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE!The acting is bad. The writing is bad - even the authentic Jane Austen dialogue comes across poorly here! None of the characters come across they way Austen described them in the book. (I don't understand the reviews calling this the most authentic version; I strongly disagree!)and don't even get me started on Mr. Darcy. huh???? When I read reviews stating that this version was better than Colin Firth, I thought that I was in for a huge treat. But this Darcy is DREADFUL. I do not know what people who like this version were watching. I love period pieces, especially Jane Austen and MOST especially P&P.; But I cannot even finish this. Blech."
2,Dull,"I'm turning into quite the collector of British classics that have been made into movies. I love the PRIDE & PREJUDICE story and own the A&E; version with Ehle and Firth. So I thought I'd like another version of the story in my collection, and the reviews encouraged me to buy.But this is so dull, it becomes a struggle to sit through. It is like watching a stage play with exaggerated character reactions. Little seems to flow naturally. The dancing was stiff. The scenery was confined to a few look-alike parlors.The emotion in the A&E; version carried me away, while this one left me yawning."
3,Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice,"This version of Pride & Prejudice, although not as wonderful as the more recent version, has many perks. This version is much shorter, cheaper, and compact. It follows the novel very closely (although not exactly) and gives a wonderful rendition of what the novel is all about."
1,Just awful,"My favorite is the 1939 version. The A&E version is great. I liked the Kera Knightly version. This one is flat and boring. Everyone is shrill. And Elizabeth has zero appeal. Just awful. Oh, and the sets stink. They spent the equivalent of my child's weekly allowance on this junk."
1,lousy,"OMG. This is so painful to watch. Lousy acting, lots of quotes from the book from wrong people, people seem to gossip, Mr. Bennett is just so crabby; everyone is obnoxious. I was going to buy this because I love this book, and I liked the A@E version, even the last movie with Kira Knightly was decent, if short. Luckily, I was able to borrow it. If you are thinking about buying this, try to at least see a preview first."
3,Not the best version,"It follows the book pretty closely, more so than some of the other versions. But again, as is with many BBC productions of these books, where is the feeling? Where is the passion? Darcy in this version is cold, and stiff, even AFTER we know he's fallen in love with Elizabeth. The acting was not too bad, the set was was good. There just isn't the ""feeling"" we get with the Ehle or the Knightly version. I give it 3 stars because it was watchable and I did enjoy it. Just not as much as the other two newer versions."
3,incorrect description,"I picked this movie because it said Colin firth was in it. However, this was not the version that had Colin firth in it. It was a completely different one."
5,For those who do not want Colin Firth,"I prefer this version as being closer to the book and the mores of Austen's time, not a sexed-up version."
3,Pride and Prejudice,It was an ok version that seemed closer to the actual novel but was not my favorite. It seemed choppy.
1,I would like to know why I was sent something used,This was sent to me for my wife as a gift from Chistmas. She wants to watch it now and it is scratched! I bought this NEW! Why is it scratched?
3,Hard to go wrong with P&P,"I enjoyed watching this version, but the description is completely wrong - this is NOT the 90s version with Colin Firth, it is the 80s BBC version. So not what I was looking for, but still worth watching if you are an Austen fan or enjoy the period."
4,janeites,"If you cannot stop reading the book, buy both the A&E; and BBC versions. Because, like myself, you obviously can't get enough. Both are entertaining enough and different enough from each other to justify the expense. Double your pleasure.C.P. of Atlanta"
2,Simply dreadful!!,"I could not even finish episode one! I have seen many versions of P&P; the very first being the 1940 Greer Garson, Lawrence Olivier version which even though it is heavily edited and incorrectly costumed is so superior to this version I am surprised people here speak so highly of this version. Such dreadful acting; artificial, overdone and unnatural. Mrs. Bennett is NOTHING like the character in the novel at all, nor is Mr. Bennett.UGH maybe if I had seen this before all others but I really think if I had I might never have even read the book at all. The only reason I give even two stars is the costuming is quite good. Too bad I cannot say the same for the acting!Even being able to watch it for free as an Amazon Prime member cannot induce me to finish this...simply dreadful."
3,Pride and Prejudice,"Even though the production value for this version is a bit poor, it still remains one of my favorites. I remembered when it first aired and was very excited. It was fun watching it again."
3,All of the story with none of the feeling,"It's amazing how many similarities there are between the spoken dialogue of this version and of the 1996 version. But to me it was even more amazing how little feeling was communicated thru the performances and the direction.Moments that I find tremendously moving and thrilling in the 1996 version pass without the least involvement in this version.The direction is static and stolid. Performances are tepid compared with the spirited portrayals in the 1996 version. Casting is everything and again the 1996 cast is vivid at every level. The director really let his 1980's cast down.This is not a novel. It's a dramatatisation of a novel, a visual retelling of a complex story in only a few hours. You can't depend on Jane Austen to make the movie as successful as the novel. There is no way I would have wanted to read the novel if this was the only dramatisation I'd had available."
3,Not as good as the A&E adaption.......,"I viewed this version after the lavish Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle adaption and even taking into account that it is 10 to 15 years older, I still found it inferior. I agree with the previous reviewer that at times it looks like it was filmed in someone's basement. All the actors seem to rush through their lines and some seemed to be just reading through them for all the lack of emotion put into them. David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy was just too stone-like for my tastes. Elizabeth Garvie was extremely good in this version, however.I highly advise you to check out the newer A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Ehle is not as likable as Garvie but Firth's Mr. Darcy makes you forget that."
3,"Good, but not good enough!","If you love Austen's book, you will only find this movie version tolerable. It was not true to the book. The voiceovers took liberties at the inner thoughts of Elizabeth that Jane Austen may not have intended. It stifles the viewer's imagination. Watch the A&E version if you are only going to watch one (it is my favorite movie of all time). But, if you want to watch another, this one is not completely lacking in merit or entertainment."
3,Thank Heaven for A&E,"I completely agree with the reviewer who stated that the reviews for this film were misleading. The razor-sharp Austen wit was almost entirely absent in this version while I laughed the whole film through during the A&E version. There was no dramatic build up which you would think would make the ending less disappointing, but sadly it does not. The last scene ends and you are left saying to yourself, ""That can't be it!"" Immediately after the movie ended, I felt the incredible urge to put in my A&E DVD and make all right with the world again. So much for reviews, but I do hope someone pays some attention to this one."
4,Most Helpful for Dream Weavers,"I have perused many dream encyclopedias, but this is my favorite because it offers several possible interpretations for each dream symbol - you choose the one that best fits your dream and your life. Also, the interpretations are deeper and more spiritual than those found in many other books. This book was my main source of guidance in writing DREAM WEAVING: USING DREAM GUIDANCE TO CREATE LIFE'S TAPESTRY."
4,Shower light,This lens is good for shower installs. We matched it up with a Halo airtight housing and we are pleased. I did paint the plastic trim bright white to match the ceiling. I used spray paint for plastic. The color was just slightly off white. The lens attaches using wire hangers. You popped these hangers into the housing slots and push into place. When you want to change out the bulb you just pull down on the edge of the trim and it hangs in place but gives you room for your hand to put the bulb in. Easy. It is only rated for 45 watt incandescent bulb. We used a cfl bulb in it. Not too bright but just enough.
2,The glass is yellow!,"I like a nice bright light for my shower, and even when I put a daylight bulb it still is too yellow for me as the glass trim glow yellow when lit up. Not happy with product...will look for other trims."
4,Nice replacement lens,"This is a nice replacement lens for my shower light. I needed the replacement, because I am clumsy, and broke the original when I was changing out the bulb. Fits right, and looks identical to the original. Recommended."
3,Just the usual westerns,None were that great. Several were westerns that are in other western DVD collections I had seen before.
1,cell phone contract,We were not happy with the coverage of T-mobile. Could not get reception where we were able to easily get bars with AT&T. Returned new phones and cancelled contract.
4,Good Deal at a Good Price,"I know nothing about multimeters, but when it was a Christmas request, I searched the web and found this one. It was a gift to my brother, who is an electrical engineer. He has found it to be all that he needs in a multimeter for basic, everyday applications. He has told me that I made an excellent choice. He says it is very accurate and highly recommends it. Of special note are the plastic casing, which protects against accidental breakage, and the ""easel"" prop for hands-free use."
5,it's nice and differn from oderheri,I enjoy the music it's enjoy hear music like whity i also enjoy all the song she sing it make send to all people who take the time to list to the word.
5,the best original music heard in a long time,"this single is really a 90's song.It says everything that happens to people everyday.Really original, and is the best work from whitney for the longest time.The remix is awesome!!!!!!!"
5,"My love and my soul for the real DIVAS""""""""""""""""""",Whitney is the best. My love is your is the best work from her. New sound and more r&b.Better than celine or Maria. All i have to say my whitney still the best for ever.
2,Disappointed,"Its a good book for Jr. to Sr. High range. He has a good message about the effects of how people feel being picked on, or even being the bully feeling the pull of peer pressure. However, after Piercing the Darkness and This Present Darkness, which are both excellent, can't put it down books, I was left wanting more. The ending was a big disappointment for me."
2,dont take my advice,the book was not a five star book i thought. Pereti could have given a few more hints in the begging of the book instead of leading tothe wrong person right away. How the students came up with the ghost taking the students wasw a good idea because i personaly could see that acctually happening in todays high schools. The way the book went the ending was way to short and could have been drawn out a little longer. From this you should be able see that i am not the best person to take advice on this book from since i ussually read total science fiction.
2,Could have been much better...,"Hangman's Curse starts when several jocks at Baker High start going completely nuts. The Veritas project -- Nate, Sarah, Elijah, and Elisha Springfield -- are called in to investigate and find the Truth.The book reads like a thriller, with a plot that keeps twisting and an ending that will shock any reader, but the characters aren't up to standard. The Springfields are all disappointingly two-dimensional, and take every opportunity to show the reader that Christ and Truth go hand-in-hand. The obvious suspects are witches, Satanists, or goths (take your pick; Peretti seems to think the three are synonomous), and the end moral of the story -- that today's high schools are full of cruel kids, evil athiest teachers, and troubled kids resorting to witchcraft because the schools lack belief in Christ -- is a little over the top.The book's interesting, and it'll keep your attention long enough to finish. Read it if you must, but I'm not sure it's worth buying."
1,Needs warning stickers,This book needs warning stickers that it is promoting the Christian agenda. It presents anti-evolutionary statements as if they were facts (to the further detriment of America's standing in education in the world) and pretends that God'll make everything ok. This is one of the very few books that I'm throwing away as opposed to donating or selling to a used book store.
5,"Good Read, Best in Audio","Frank Peretti delivers!! This is wonderful youth fiction, but adults who read Harry Potter will enjoy this mystery/suspense book. One tip? Mr. Peretti's voice on the audio book is outstanding and he is a wonderful story teller."
5,The Hangman's Curse,"I love Frank Peretti's books. He somehow manages to combine suspence and christian values in a such a way that I can't stop reading once I start. The Hangman's curse was a great book. It stayed interesting througout the entire book. I never knew what was coming next. I also love it when he says, ""Metal detectors may keep weapons out of schools ... but these will not keep out the pain, anger, and loneliness that cause a child to bring a weapon to school in the first place."" I hope he writes more."
3,Very entertaining I enjoyed it!,"This book was very exciting to read. It reads very quickly and keeps the reader involved. I couldn't stop turning the pages because I wanted to know what happened next. It is a great story and I would highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys suspense.The reason I am only giving it three stars is because it is very poorly written. It flowed well, but it was not nearly as good as it could be. If the story was told by a more skilled author, it could have been a much better book. When writing dialogue, The author often uses the word ""said"" (he said,said Elija); instead he could describe it so that the words painted a clearer picture (he muttered sarcasticly, Elijah replied calmly but his composure poorly masked his disgust). But even with its faults, I can't deny, though, that I really enjoyed reading this book."
5,Awesome,"This is the best book I've ever read. It's suspensful, funny, scary all at the same time. I would strongly suggest you read this book."
5,An Awesome Book!!,"This book is excellent. I have read just about every Frank Peretti book. He never stops amazing me. I read ""Hangmans Curse: The Veritas Project"" in two and a half hrs. I could't put it down. I can't wait for the next one in the series. If you haven't read this yet, go get it!"
4,Passing another book on to my daughter...,Years ago one of my co-workers lent me his copy of this book to read. I really liked it but I haven't met a Frank Peretti book that I've despised. At the time my daughter was too young for it but now she's old enough for to read and enjoy it. It took a while to find it again because it wasn't available anywhere but I kept looking and finally found it on Amazon. I'm going to read it again after she does. One of our very favorite things to do together is talk about books that we've read.
5,Great for teens and adults,"I bought this book for my teenage son, started reading it and couldn't put it down. I've read other Peretti books and knew that he was an excellent, Christian author whose books are never ""preachy."" This book lives up to his standards. Even as an adult who has long forgotten the trials and rejections of adolescence, I felt like I was transported back into that time and could truly empathize with the kids who were getting picked on. This book really helps you to understand why there is so much violence in schools today. Plus, the story line has so many twists and turns that you're constantly on the edge of your seat. You can't put the book down until you find out what's going on -- and the ending is really a surprise. I loved this book and recommend it to both teens and adults!"
5,Hangman's Curse,"I recommend you read this book because this is the best book I've read in my entire life. It's about a high school that people think has been haunted. But has it? Well, let these teachers, parents, and high schoolers guide you through the book with surprising events happening throughout each chapter and throughout the whole book. Yes, it is long, but it is really good. It's so good you won't want to stop reading. It is a little bit religious, but other than that it is a good book. I think this because it keeps you waiting until the very end to know what happens to everyone."
2,not so good,"anakin skywalker was the firts sideshow action figure that i got from this line, dont get me wrong the line is very good, but it seens that in anakin there was some issues regarding what type of leather or vinyl sideshow would use, in the jedi uniform, and it seems it was the cheapest choise, my anakin leather came off, all of it, it was like it melted away, for me paying almost 80 dollars and this happens after only 2 years of having the product is unacceptable, and belive me if theres a way of letting sideshow know of this ill find it soon, i feel i was cheated,you pay for quality and at the end you get crap."
5,We love you!,"Aw, Donny Osmond. The man with three careers! Member of three musical groups! You can guarantee that Donny won't be out of work any time soon as a member of three bands. And each one completely different!First, there is his job as keyboardest for the legendary rock band the Osmonds. Second, is his duo as Donny and Marie. And if that weren't enough there is his solo career as Donny Osmond.If one doesn't work out he can just move on to the next one. But the best part is that he keeps all three going and ahead of the game!"
5,Donny Osmond Singles,I ordered this for another person and he has really enjoyed the CD. It came in excellent condition and we were very pleased with the product. Thank you.
3,HIGH QUALITY BUT NOT THE EVERYDAY MAN,"Tom Bianchi is a great photographer with a great eye for beauty. His books are filled with passion and beautiful people. He is considered one of the greats. However...I find this book ON THE COUCH to be very typical of what most gay men fantasize about. These guys are ruggedly handsome or beautifully handsome with chisled chests, bulging arms, well crafted shoulders, flat (and some with a six pack of abs) stomach and muscular legs. To defend the photos: Tom did say this is what he looks for in a man (preface). Not every gay man looks for a body builder as a partner. Some want a man with a good strong mind, sweet personality and good disposition. Sometimes what is on the inside can be more handsome than what is on the outside.Regardless, the photographs are top notch (considering he used a digital camera). I am not knocking his talent, just he choices for subjects."
4,Reviewed as a world history teacher,"I am reviewing this as a high school world history teacher who is looking for high-quality historical fiction of all skill levels that I can add to my classroom library.While this book is too easy for the average high school student, it would be a good fit for the 'reluctant reader' or the student interested in the Reformation. The plot moves along pretty quickly and does a good job of telling about Martin Luther's big moment at the Diet of Worms and his travels immediately before and after his hearing.Some previous knowledge of the Reformation would be helpful.I give this one a B+."
5,Great Book,My wife loves it. She carries it in her purse and everywhere she goes. She has read it cover to cover and has continue to read it over and over again.
3,Interesting insight into the movie,"I picked this book up because I was curious about how some of the dialog evolved from the novel to the movie.I got those answers, and more: from reading the forewards, script notes, and seeing 100's of pictures from the set, this book helped me understand the filmmakers' worldview and artistic vision as they advanced the story beyond Dan Brown's printed pages.I also really liked that this screenplay edition included lots of storyboards and behind-the-scenes depictions of the intricately constructed sets and props.But unless you're really into the genre, you could probably get as much from thumbing through a borrowed copy in a half-hour as you would from buying and reading this book page-for-page."
2,Dont Buy for P-01,"Recieved these sights, installed them in my P-01, and now the point of impact is three inches low at 50 ft! The factory irons were dead on at this distance!! Not sure what the problem is, but don't get these for your P-01!!!"
5,This book is really cute!,"I teach young children and they really like this book. Although there are a lot of animals, it's fairly simple. There are a lot of words,so if you have a young group (toddlers or twos) you may want to leave out some of the words. The pictures are adorable and I especially love the hamsters, who only sleep for an hour!Then they're up again ""at their hamstery best."" Very cute book."
4,A Great Band With Great Songs and Exciting Sounds,"Although the sound of this recording is a little cleaner than it needs to be for this style of music (just like most of the VOXX recordings of the mid-'80s), this album really spotlights the fact that this is one of the only garage bands that can actually boast song-writing as one of their strengths. Most bands (my own included) contented themselves to just dig up a bunch of obscure cover songs and maybe only wrack their brains enough to write one or two half way decent originals. Here the Workers present a dozen or so great originals with only one carefully picked cover song ""Hey Little Bird"". Highlights include ""Go Now"", ""Already Gone"", ""Tears"", and ""Mystery Girl"". These are songs I can still hum even if I haven't listened to this disc in ages. If you love the 13th Floor Elevators, the Sonics, the Seeds, or other psychedelic/garage type music, then you'll enjoy this record too."
4,Best neo-psychedelic garage band ever,"The Miracle Workers operated for a while in a very cool time-warp, right down to being recorded badly and having a snotty lead singer. I was lucky enough to see them in the Satyricon, in Portland, Oregon, where their rave-up was enough to make you think you were hearing the Sonics, the Chocolate Watchband, and the Shadows of Knight all at once. This album is a good document, with three or four absolute killer tracks and then some filler. If you like the stuff on Nuggets, these guys fit right in. That's a compliment!"
5,so touching,"i'd just like to say this book was as close to perfect as they get!! scott and elizabeth's plans have been changed (by scott) and they are leaving then next day!! jessica doesn't want elizabeth to go, and tom is completely desperate to get back together with her. dana and scott have joined forces to keep them apart, and dana does a darn good job of it!! elizabeth is still completely in love with tom, and is leaving mainly because she is so miserable. the ending is perfect- very emotional. i cried so much while reading this! not a good thing, since it was about 1 AM (that's how late it kept me up!) and i was absolutely sobbing!! this was, without a doubt, my favorite book from this series (and i've read a lot, believe me!) or even anywhere!"
3,Problem Book!,"Yuck! I mean, c'mon, Tom and Liz? They can't last, they won't last. Liz is such good friends with Todd and friendship leads to love... Plus the writers will go and do the CRAZIEST plots! Ya know what? I think this'll happen: Jess and Nick are breaking up Jess thinks Tom is a good kisser Liz is missin Todd Tada- Liz&Todd and Jess&Tom I cant wait for 39- but I bet Tom and Liz won't last long! Maybe they'll even break up then. Oh, and a summary? Liz almosts goes than doesnt"
4,What happens next?!?,"How come the story line just ends there? No further explanations?!? I've been reading and waiting for each book to come out and when it does....it sort of disappoints me because i thought they'd at least write about their make up and everything...but all in all, i'm glad liz and tom got back together!"
1,IS THERE A CLEP BOOK FOR THE LANGUAGE TEST (SPANISH),I HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SPANISH TEST EXAMPLES IN THERE. DOES ANYONE KNOW OF A CLEP BOOK WITH SPANISH EXAMPLES IN IT? PLEASE HELP.DISTRESSED.
4,Good Basic Information,"Enjoyed the movie as it appears to be the only visual history available for Will Rogers.However, the book by Ben Yagoda is a must read follow up."
3,It's Not WrestleMania,"I loved the WWF in the 1980s and early 1990s. Survivor Series was always a memorable part of Thanksgiving. But watching this anthology, 20 years removed from it, and with a number of other events succeeding it, didn't rekindle the original spark it had. Volume 1 is probably good for one viewing; I might watch the 1990 and 1991 events again.I certainly wouldn't encourage anyone to use the early Survivor Series Antologies to introduce younger wrestling fans to a previous age of the sport. The match quality just isn't fantastic, and some of the talent and their gimmicks are ridiculous. Most 9-12 year-olds might have a hard time enjoying these events.Volume 1 does include peak Hulkamania, which I did enjoy. Undertaker's debut can't be overlooked either.But for the best wrestling of this era, and a better way to introduce younger kids to the era, would be the WrestleMania anthologies. The match quality (even if short in length) and production values are significantly better."
2,Latin all the way,"The three brothers are genuine artists at their trade. Since the album is in Spanish, many people may not experience the full flavor of the lyrics. All in all, the album is very good. As far as melody is concerned, they do it all. It's easy to listen to and visualize. I recommend this album to Latin music lovers.Los Tres Reyes en Concierto"
3,First contact might be misleading,"So any way, I liked the tune first contact a bit, It showed up on a couple Moving Shadow comps and of course it is on the GTA 3 game. My problem is this, mixed in with the other songs on this realese it looses some of it's appeal. don't get me wrong there are some interesting sounds on this disc, but the beats don't hit me as hard as I would like. I like mellow music as well as the abbrasive stuff, but to sum it all up This is a mellow roller.(if that makes any sence). I am sure I will grow quite fond of this album. It just isn't my favorite right now."
4,Good Content Bad Print,"I bought this for a class in advanced networking, and the content was good but the print was not the greatest almost as if someone ran it through a copy machine. I would recommend Oppenhiemer top-down networking in addition to this book if you are serious about designing a customer centric network"
4,Great class material,"Campus Network Design is a worthy book for learning network design and the concepts that make up the networks on a smaller scale. The book is written well for beginners and intermediates that want to strengthen their overall understanding of networks. This was a class book for me, and after a few years of network experience, I learned new things and solidified what I already knew. The writer is easy to read, and the concepts are logically laid out. This is not an advanced book."
3,+1/2 -- Gritty blues from Detroit,"This Detroit quintet serves up gritty electric bar blues, adding a funky edge to a style derived from Albert Collins, Steve Ray Vaughn, and others. Their second album features a solid rhythm section, with Shannon Boone's drums mixed favorably hot - it gives the album the sort of punch you'd expect to hear in a club setting. Mike Smith's guitar and Johnny Evans' harp and sax each provide memorable riffs and solos, and vocalist Tino Gross sings with both swagger and grit. Howling devils, indeed! 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [2005 hyperbolium dot com]"
5,"Very good price performance, durable","I used Brush-T and like it, but not the price (~$3/ea). The GOGO Tees are good replacements. I found only one length 2.4 inch and luckily it is what I used for my 460cc driver.Yes, the Brush-T is easier to keep the golf ball stays, the GOGO tee is thinner, so you need to insert it in straight like other tees and I found no problem with it; it is very easy to use the clear cap to push the tee. It is durable, I'm still using the first one after 15+ rounds.Yes, I am pleased with the product and will recommend it to my golf friends."
4,Great collection,Truly the best of Bombeck! A great addition to your bookshelf if you are a Bombeck fan!
4,Bombeck Amazes,"Bombeck never ceases to amaze with a unique ability to hit the nail on the head while poking fun at the realities of life. I was laughing out loud from the very first page. I purchased this book to cheer up a friend with cancer who is undergoing radiation and chemo. The book arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner from Amazon through the seller, Giggil."
4,Book in good condition,The book was in great condition. I was pleasantly surprised as this was an old book & I am picky about the conditon of my books.
1,Amazon should not recommend this for Bunn coffeemakers!!!,"I've owned reusable filters for years and wish Bunn made one, but they don't...period. Shame on Amazon for linking these two products!"
3,Good but not for Bunn,"This filter works fine and makes a good cup of coffee. However, if you have a Bunn coffee maker, forget it. The Bunn machines require a taller filter. If you use a regular height filter (like the Perma-Brew) you'll end up with grounds in your carafe. This filter comes with directions to make a pot of coffee in two stages. So, it is really a stretch to say this filter works with a Bunn coffee maker. If I can't find a taller one I'll just stick with the paper filters."
2,Re-useable coffee filter,"I recently purchased a Bunn Coffee Maker and with this purchase I also purchased the Perma-Brew 3 year re-useable coffee filter that was recommended in the add. The filter is not tall enough for these Bunn coffee makers...unlike the paper filters that are made for the Bunn Coffee Brewers which are taller then standard size filters you might buy at the grocery store. When I used the Perma-Brew 3 year re-useable filter I ended up with coffee grounds in my coffee....it overflows in the basket and the grounds end up all over... big mess....If your company is going to recommend an item with something being purchased then you should make sure the item actually works properly with the device.Thank you,Norma HendersonPerma-Brew 3 Year Re-useable Coffee Filter, Fluted Basket"
2,Not what I hoped,"I thought this would be great so I didn't need to keep getting paper. I also heard paper keeps some of the oils from getting through. This filter has a bottom that is divided into six ""compartments"". Only 2 of the 6 allow liquid to go through. The other 4 were solid plastic like the frame. I do not know if it is the design or a defect but the packaging does not include anything to make me understand if it is intentional or not. At any rate, the water wasn't going through and what did took forever and too much was left in the filter when I gave up. I can't imagine it is meant to work that way but I would not recommend it as it is."
5,Nice option,Great option to add. Enjoy not having to use paper products. It was not expensive to add to other purchase.
1,Coffee filter,"This filter is not for the BUNN, it is not tall enough to prevent the coffee from overflowing. Each time I used it, it caused a big mess.I made a 1/2 of pot of coffee, still a big mess.The coffee grounds clogs the pores and the water and coffee over flow.I received great service, it arrived on time, yet did not send back since it was only a few dollars."
2,disappointed,"If I had known the conditions for using this filter in a Bunn coffee maker I would not have ordered it. You can only add a small amount of water at a time or the water will over fill the filter and you'll get coffee grounds in the pot. The way a Bunn maker is designed you're supposed to add the water then close the lid from there it automatic with water in it thats already hot it just replaces that hot water with your new cold water, remembering to stop and restart the brewing process is kinda a pain. Maybe for a different brand coffee maker it might be okay, but the Bunn pumps water out too fast for such a shallow filter."
1,not what I hoped for,The mesh on this filter is so fine that the coffee grounds ended up all over the coffee maker and in the coffee. I was very disappointed in it. I was hoping for the same quality as the perm filter that came with my son's coffee maker.......but it was not even close.
1,Re-useable Coffee Filter,"Perma-Brew 3 Year Re-useable Coffee Filter, Fluted Basket Good idea but filter is too short and you get coffee grounds in your coffee. It doesn't seen like it's the right size for the Bunn Coffee Maker and it said it was."
1,Grounds in my coffee,"This filter was recommended for purchase with our Bunn BT Velocity 10 cup brewer. It is probably okay with your standard brewer which brews at a slower pace, but NOT with this brewer. We make 6 cups (30 ounces) in the morning which results in the coffee overflowing the filter basket dumping grounds into the carafe...NOT a good thing. So...I certainly would not suggest this filter. We use the paper filters and have not had this problem."
1,filter,"This was a suggested buy with my Bunn coffee maker. This works poorly with the Bunn. It's too short, letting the grounds go right over the top into the pot! Should not be recommended with Bunn! A waste of money!"
2,Do NOT use with a Bunn coffee maker -- DANGEROUS,"I don't know how well this filter actually works, it looks like it will work well with a Mr. Coffee, etc. Amazon recommended using it with a Bunn coffee maker. THIS IS A REALLY BAD IDEA. The filter is fairly short. Bunn coffee filters are taller than normal because the water goes in so quickly (making a pot of coffee in 3 minutes means lots of water quickly). Regardless, using this filter with a Bunn worked poorly. The water came out faster than the filter could handle it, the basket overflowed, a good deal of the coffee washed out and clogged the entry hole on the top of the pot ... which caused the coffee to run all over the counter and floor. We had hot coffee and grounds everywhere (drawers, pantry, floor, counter). It was a mess."
1,Coffee grounds all over the place,"We used the coffee filter for the first time today. A total disaster! During the brewing, the coffee grounds overflowed the reusable filter, and got into the brewed coffee. Not just a couple grounds, but lots! The pot was undrinkable. I used the same amount and kind of coffee and the same amount of water as with the usual disposable filters. The only change was that I used the reusable filter. I won't be trying the replacement filter again. Just not worth it."
2,Not what I expected.,I didn't know until I received the item that it really isn't for a Bunn coffee maker although it says it is on the website. The instructions said to use twice to make a fully cup when using a Bunn. It is defindately to small for that coffee maker. I won't return due to the cost of returning such an inexpensive item.
3,Too shallow.. . . . .,"Not a bad product if you like your coffee on the weaker side, . . as for me I prefer a stronger cup and tend to use more coffee grounds. The sides are too short and I end up drinking grounds. I ended up throwing the ""reusable"" filter away and puchasing paper filters."
1,Believe the reviews,Don't waste your money and your time cleaning up the mess it makes! To small for more than 4 cups!
4,"good, could fir better",Use it every day without complaint. If it actually fit our coffee maker properly then it would be 5 stars. We use the Bunn 4-8 cup coffee maker and only Bunn paper filters fit correctly. It isn't a huge issue for us because we don't make 8 cups at a time and we have a stash of paper filters if we need them. The issue is this filter is shorter by a couple inches than it should be. What I don't get is this was a recommended product to go with the coffee maker. How can you recommend something you know doesn't fit properly?
3,NOT for Bunn Thermo Fresh Brewer!,"If you like a gigantic pool of coffee and grounds on your countertop when you come back into the kitchen for your 3 minute Bunn coffee, then this is for you. Filter basket is way too short and quickly overflows. Buy the paper filters (extra tall) if you can find them. Basket probably works very well in the right application, but not for my brewer!"
2,Great filter but not for a Bunn Coffee maker,"I bought his filter when I saw it online as I thought it would be a great back up. Well I used in my Bunn Coffee Maker and what a mess!! Those of you who own a Bunn Coffee Maker know Bunn uses tall filters and this one is not tall. I had to use it to strain the coffee again before drinking it. However, it does clean up very easily. Very sturdy and seems like it would last for a good while for someone who used a coffee maker that this would fit.Great idea and product, just wish it fit my Bunn coffee maker."
2,Not for a Bunn,I was very disappointed with the Perma-Brew reusable filter. Amazon showed this product with the Bunn Coffee Maker that I purchased. I actually thought the Perma-Brew Coffee Filter was made for the Bunn. This was not true. The Bunn Coffee Maker brews the coffee much too fast for this filter so the coffee goes over the sides of the filter and fills the coffee pot with grounds.This product is probably good and useful for other coffee makers that brew coffee in 10 plus minutes and not 3 like the Bunn.
2,Perma-Brew Re-usable Coffee Filter,It works good but I don't like the product because it takes a lot of water and time to clean it. Paper filters are so much more convenient to use. I can't recommend this product.
2,Does not fit Bunn,"The description of this product was incomplete. This filter does not properly fit Bunn coffee makers. It works, but you have to feed 1/2 the water, wait for it to process, then feed the other half of the water. A small thing for most people, perhaps, but not what I wanted. Looks like it would be just fine for other coffee makers, though."
2,To small for a Bunn,"I bought this at the same time I ordered aBUNN HT Phase Brew 8-Cup Thermal Carafe Home Coffee Brewer. They were frequently purchased together. My mistake for not reading the reviews. I'd so love a reusable filter, but havent been able to find one that fits a Bunn properly. I went with the case ofPk/100 x 12: Bunn Coffee & Tea Filters (BCF/100-B) Box contains 100 Filters."
2,doesnt work!,"This filter is too short for the basket on my coffee maker. It was recomended when I made the coffee maker purchase,but it doesnt fit."
4,OK - don't really need it now,"It is just what I wanted - a back up in case I ran out of coffee filters. As I just rated the Bunn 1000 coffee filters, that doesn't seem likely! =)"
3,Re-usable coffee filter,My husband does NOT like this product...says it over-flows and gets grounds into the coffee.....so we do not even use it.
2,too small for my coffee maker,Like the idea of a reuseable coffee filter but does not fit my coffee maker. We had quite the mess to clean up when we used it.
1,junk,This is to small do not buy it. The coffee comes over the top even if you make a small amount like 4 cups! It flows over and gets in the pot. What a waste of money no matter how cheap it is.
1,Don't Use it with a Bunn,"1 star because it didn't work with Bunn. I didn't check the remarks on this one. I have always used a re-usable coffee filter so I don't keep using paper. This was pictured with the Bunn and I just assumed it worked with it. It does not. It is too short and grounds get into the coffee pot. I wish Bunn would come up with a reusable tall filter but until that happens, I will need to buy the Bunn paper filters.BUNN NHBB Velocity Brew 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, BlackBUNN NHBB Velocity Brew 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, Black"
5,Easy and green,"Great bargin. Not only is this basket a money saver, it is an easy way to go green. Highly recommend."
3,Good for California Investigators,"I have been involved in the investigative field for 12 years. I have worked in uniformed management, white collar crime, undercover, insurance defense, etc. I found the book to be written more for a personal reference of the author. Section one was quite helpful (Working Your Case), but the remainder was almost exclusively for California agents.The author showed a good knowledge of the history of bail agents, and did provide some good cases for reference.Overall the book was OK as a reference point for Bail Enforcement Agents, but I personally believe that the claim of ""The Bible"" for the profession is a bit much."
4,Is science going too far?,"You'll be left wondering if science is going too far after reading this H.G. Wells' classic. This novella tells the story of how science is able to make food, people, and animals bigger and stronger. Huge wasps, rats and giant men run about in this book due to the work of science. Of course people have gotten bigger in the 20th century, due primarily to better nutrition, health care, excercise, etc., but we are hardly the 40 foot giants Wells' talks about. I found it easy to associate Wells' fears with the fears many of today's people have over cloaning. When does science go too far? This story is fairly short and you won't want to put it down. Best of all, this Wells' classic will get you thinking!"
3,not sure,"i bought it to mix with my laptop.it's not for that.u need a separate sound card. (osea, two soundcards)Not recommended"
2,Torq MixLab review,"Not sure if I could recommend this people, even if on sale. That being said, this unit retails for $100.00. I would never have purchased this thing for $100.00. The crossfader seems loose. I'm not sure if that is intentional or just my unit."
3,Controller fine. Torq le buggy,"The x-session does what it says. The enclosed le software however is crunchy in sound, particularly when mixing. Eqs are too sharp, and there are mysterious midi jumps from one command to another. I was in mid mix when suddenly my filter started. I may have bumped it though. Waveform is crowded compared to other software. You get what you pay for. Oh and torq le would freeze momentarily, yet keep playing whenever I loaded a track, then resume it's playing. Not a full crash mind you but worrisome. Very disturbing. Btw all wifi and virus software was off."
4,Works great with Ableton Live,"Ordered this controller simply because it was 35 bucks, it was a good decision. Sturdier and a bit larger than I was expecting, USB powered, shipped fast. Took about 3 minutes to setup with Ableton, it would of been quicker but the crossfader outputs 2 midi CC's (17-Normal & 20-Inverted) so choose CC17 and all is well. Torq software went right in the trash so I can't comment on it. 1 or 2 endless rotaries would of been cool.Bottom line it's a good cheapo controller: 12 knobs, 10 buttons, 4 faders and 1 cross-fader for a very good price.Ableton live users, pair this with a Launchpad and you're pretty much set!"
4,nice kit,I had to rebuild 4 of the polaris clutches and this kit made my life alot easier for one of them
3,Not all the same size,"I bought these for juggling, really wanted them to all by the exact same size. One of them was considerably smaller, though, which it really annoying. I'm sure that will vary from order to order, but still, that's just lame."
4,Quality Guatemalan Hackey sacks,"I purchased a set of 3 of these from Penny Lane Gifts. They are quality Guatemalan 'Killer Beads' hackey sacks. These aren't filled with junky styrofoam and plastic baggies, like some of the cheaper options. They are a good size, a quality knit, and generally have a good weight and feel. My friends much prefer these to Dirtbag footbags, which are more expensive and sand filled."
1,lame hacky sacks. they are squashed to one side.,hack sacks should be spherical. not pancakes shaped. lousy for actually trying to play hacky sack. make nice decorations. I would recommend buying real hacky sacks.
2,Not actual Hacky Sacks...,"Nice as a novelty gift! This item has plastic beads in a plastic baggy surrounded by a wool like yarn that opened at its end exposing the plastic insides with in 5 min of use. As to show they are aware of the Hacky Sack unraveling, They preemptively have the beads in a plastic baggy since they know it comes undone. I didn't expect much for the price but I didn't expect this!Hemp or Leather Hacky Sacks is the way to go!! IMO."
1,fell apart in less than a day,I bought these hacky sacks because of the star rating. My friends and I are learning to play hacky sack at the office. In just two days use(very minimal as well) all three bags had begun to unravel and one bag had the insides coming out. Terrible quality.
1,Wrong Hacky Sacks!,"What the picture shows and what I received are totaly different. I ordered these specifically because of the way they looked. I got 3 totally different ones, red, orange, yellow colored. Because what I ordered is not what I received, I give this 1 star."
1,Big Disappointment,This book was a Big disappointment. It has useless information. This is not worth your money.
1,A real disapointment for 'rock hounds'. Ok for kids.,"I made the mistake of buying this book SE, as well as NE and NW site unseen hoping it was something like Eckert's series. I was very disapointed. Very few sites are listed, most of those are very well known sites. In fact all of the sites listed in some states are only for mining or mineral museums! This may be a good book for kids or someone just getting started, but since Eckert's book has been republished, I really would point them there first. In fact, 5 minutes on the web can locate all the mining museums located in this book. Save your money for the Eckert series."
3,A Wonderful Adventure Story,"While not destined to become a mangum opus of its genre, this short volume recounts a true story of a sailing adventure -- at once compelling, humorous, terrifying, thought provoking. Certainly worth the relatively short read. Qualifies as a truly interesting story of a father and son team who set out to sail around Cape Horn, the southernmost tip of South America, the ""bottom of the world."" Not using motors, GPS navigation systems, and the like, but old fashioned sailing, survival and navigation skills. Also a story of a father/son relationship and its development during this adventure and ordeal."
2,Reckless with animals.,"Fair sailing story about a boy who lost a kitten overboard in the South Atlantic. No safety precautions wasted on the cat apparently. Sad, but no real problem, as he picked up another cat, and a monkey, later in the voyage. No mention is made of their ultimate fate. Literary use of ""f__k"" and ""s__t"" to add needed color to the tale no doubt."
2,"Mildly interesting, turned off by language","I was enjoying this moderately until right about midway (between Galapagos and Easter Island) when the language got rougher than the seas and I deep-sixed it. After reading Joshua Slocum's ""Sailing Alone Around The World"", (a tremendous story!) this book seemed crude and sophomoric."
1,very boring!,i found this book to be very boring. it was the same thing over and over for almost 300 pages.. i would highly not reccamend this book..
4,both an adventure tale and a family story,"I'm on somewhat of a sailing/adventure kick these days, and this book is full of great adventure. Unlike The Godforsaken Sea which is populated by hugh and high tech yachts, this book features the Sparrow, a tiny 25 foot sailboat built by the father and son who sail it. Therefore, their adventure is even more incredible. Lundy even refers to it in The Godforsaken Sea with some awe. Occassionally, you may get sick of some of the personal reflections of the son, but overall, I enjoyed their personal reflections. More than the family bonding, I enjoyed the day to day details: the huge lists, the small tasks that fill the sailing day, the meticulous descriptions of storms and weather -- this is what made the book vivid. For anyone who enjoys this kind of sailing adventure, this book is a must read. I'm still amazed that they made it with some of the tremendous risks they took. An enduring tale of man against nature."
5,Good Father and Son Adventure,"My father bought and read the book this last fall, when finished wanted me to read it. I enjoyed living this adventure vicariously through Dave and Dan. The only down point of the book was the son appears to be somewhat flakey, perhaps it's just my homophobic fears, there were just some parts of the book I didn't care to know. However, letting the cat chew through the electrical cables was cool. The book made me think of my own relationship with my father"
5,Great addition to my library!!!!,I AM NOT A BEGINNER BUT CAN SEE HOW ANYONE CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS TERRIFIC BOOK. HE IS A MAREVELOUS PAINTER AND GREAT DETAILS ON HOW TO DO THIS. YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH FROM HIS ILLUSTRATIONS. I HAVE IMPROVED TREMENDOUSLY AND LOVE TO USE HIS BOOK OVER AND OVER. GOOD TO HAVE THE BOOK EVERYWHERE I TRAVEL AROUND WATER SO I CAN READ FOR INSTRUCTIONS.
1,Paint the Sea in Oils Using Special Effects,"As a new painter I am very disappointed with this book.I was hoping for detailed illustrations and step by step instruction. Well this is not it. In the product description it had mentioned for the beginner, well it's not for this beginner. Perhaps I'll try a Bob Ross "" Joy of Painting"""
5,I would have spent $100.00 for this book. It's that good.,"If you a realist painter, buy this book! E. John Robinson explains everything about how to paint the sea in an easy to understand manner with 100's of color pictures to demonstrate. I loved this book and have been able to create beautiful paintings because of it."
4,Works great - couple things to know...,"I have a Mac G4 laptop running 10.4.8. From opening the box to having 20 cards well scanned was only about 20 mins. 2 things to be aware of: First, you cannot scan the back of a card (other than making it a separate entry in the database). If you are like me and constantly jot info on the back - you will need to enter that text by hand into the notes field.Second, it cannot recognize 'reversed' text (white text on a dark back ground). Even very clear, sharp, large text is completely lost. Of my 20 cards, 2 had reversed text, and I had to enter those in by hand.All in all, the recognition was very very good. Lots of smarts there. The product configured easily and worked as it should. The interface is a bit goofy - but not too bad. I thing this is a good purchase"
2,unrealiable - keep looking,"Iris has loads of experience developing OCR software so I'd hoped for something better.1) The software throws an error message and crashes if the data files are not on your local machine so don't store them on a server. I lost of lot of data that way until I isolated the source of the error. There is nothing in the readme that lists this restriction.2) The scanner worked for a day (scanned in 150 card) and then just stopped working. No error message from the application, I'd click the scan button, accept the scan dialog box, the box would close, but no scan.3) Iris only does M-F 9-5 Eastern time tech support.4) Of the 150 US business cards that I scanned, the software was not able to recognize the business name in about 50% of them. I had to enter it manually. Did not have that many problems with other fields though."
4,IRISCard Pro Business Card Scanner review,"I've got functionality as expected - to scan business cards and arrange it. Recognition usually is not a problem, even in Russian, but sometimes (about 20% of cases) software cannot understand field's purpose. I have to spend 30 seconds for card scanning and about 2 minutes for additional check and final approval.But, once checked, you're able to use database forever. Definitely I'll continue using it; secretary would be a great addition for the tool :)"
1,Poor implementation,It sounds like a very nice product but I had issues from the start. It will not scan a business card that is mostly black. Scanning pictures is almost impossible. The business card data import function is poor and the user is required to go in and make several changes to the imported cards. It is not worth the price unless you just want images of the business cards. I have returned to importing the business card information by hand because it takes longer to use the scanner and correct all the mistakes. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you have disposable income and lots of time.
3,Review of Cardis IRIS,"The Amazon service was great. The product was dificult to get started, but then it worked ok. I wish it had more sorting options. The directions were insuficcient."
4,Compatible with PC and Mac?,This scanner was easy to set-up and use in Windows. However when we tried to use it on the Mac we encountered many problems when trying to export the data to our email client. I would therefore recommend it for PC use only.
3,Standard Covers,"I bought a funky single seat cover for the driver's seat from this manufacturer and it fit a bigger bucket seat pretty well and is really fun. These ... just don't fit as well. They seem to have the same shape, but are less stretchy/flexible. I'm happy to have the protection to my upholstery, but I was surprised this one was less flexible that the other. *shrug* Still, good for the price certainly."
2,Great if you're looking for a refresher,"Let me start with the format. The copy I received was burned DVD-R with a home-made label. My DVD player chokes on it about halfway through the disc. The second issue I have is that if you're still trying to learn the katas, the guy moves pretty fast. It's hard to stay up with him (even after they slow him down). It is a bit more difficult to follow a video than it is to watch a 3-D class of students and teachers who turn with you (once you're not facing the screen, it's hard to follow along). I was expecting a little more commentary on how each form was done (they do mention when to keep a heel down here and there). I was hoping for more of a ""forward stance here, moving into a cat stance, high block, high block, middle punch..."" etc.I was a little disappointed in this one. Also, the only kata is the first form and a little of Tekki. The beginning history of kata was kind of interesting, but past that, this wasn't exactly what I was looking for."
3,winnie the poo bed,"this bed needs two people to put together, my doughter loved (play laying in it ) but shes still going thru the im in my own bed phase , Have Patience putting this together , some holes dont inline with each other"
5,Very good product,"When it comes to furniture, I've definitely found myself moving away from wood and toward steel frame furniture. This went together easily. I got two (twins) and it took me a half hour to assemble both of them. Because it's steel frame and there's even metal threading where the steel screws into the plastic, I know I'll be able to take it apart and put it together fine no matter how often we move.I don't think it's quite as durable as some of the high-end wood furniture because of the plastic. It looks like if they tried, over time, they could break it. However, I can't bring myself to pay $150 - $200 per bed for something they'll grow out of in the next 2 -3 years."
5,Great buy,Nice sturdy material. Colors have held up so far. Great price. Also a good conversation starter (Riverdogs?). I am gong to buy more.
3,"Not a toy, so questions make no sense","the review asked how much fun is this toy, it is not a toy but rather a piece of equipment that works just fine. Mine lasted 2 seasons. i bought a new one for next season and tossed my other one because the electrode thing stopped working. replacing that costs more than buying the whole thing on sale. It's nice. I prefer the saltwater concept of chlorine management rather than the harsher chemicals. easier on the whole experience. Cheap, works, lasted 2-seasons. Not bad. could last longer, but for the money, you just can't beat it. Other products that do the same thing are much more expensive. Look for this item on sale."
1,Horrible customer service!,"I bought this item for the pool I purchased last year but when setting it up, it had a leak so I no longer needed the saltwater system. I contacted the seller to get a return authorization response within the 30 day window. They never responded until I filed an amazon claim. Then they finally responded and were not helpful and never emailed me back after my 2nd reply. I have filed another amazon claim and will update later. They are not good about responding to customer problems, etc so hopefully if you buy the product it works well because dealing with this seller is a hassle."
1,Not generating enough.,I am returning it to the store. The green light was on as I ran it all night for 3 consecutive days. I finally had to give up on the machine and add treat the water myself.
1,Chlorine Generator Saltwater Pool System - Intex Model 56601E,Hello:Quite simply this product don't work. New out of the box or may last one day. I had three of them in six months from the factory and the last time they just ignore my phone calls. It wouldn't even take care of a 10k pool. I wouldn't give this one star but I have to to post this.
1,no response,"i purchased this system less than one year ago. the system would not work a few months after purchased, so i contacted the seller. they suggested a remedy for the system which also did not work. i recontacted the seller numerous times still in the warranty time period with no response. i would not recommend this seller for any transactions, they do not stand behind there items."
5,So Far So Good,"We only installed this system a week ago, but I already enjoy having it.We installed this and a 1,000 GPH pump/filter at the same time onto our 12'x30"" Intex pool. I added 40 lbs of salt and stabilizer. The chlorinator has been running great.With such a small pool, I really have to watch the water level. If it evaporates even just an inch or two, then the chlorinator gives a High Salt reading and I have to add more water to the pool."
5,Salt Chlorinator,"If you hate to hassle with chemicals for your pool, you need this chlorinator. It keeps the pool clean and balanced. We went on a trip recently and the dog unplugged the unit. The pool went green. I started the pump back up without adding any chemicals and it was pretty blue again in 24 hours. This is the best product for the money. Some stores sell this unit but buying online can save you about $100."
5,Saltwater Pool system,Me and my family love this product so far! It works really well and it keeps my pool very clean. So very easy to use too!!
5,No headache pool maintenance,"My family is going on our third year with this salt pump and its never let us down.We've had the funny codes pop up but the manual clearly tells you what to do to solve the problem. We went on vacation last summer for a week and the pool was completly green when we got back. We started the filters up and it only took it 2 days and it was crystal clear. I love the fact that I dont have to mess with chemicals or even have a chlorine tab floating around the pool. Its so easy, its ridiculous!! The bonus I love, the salt water makes your hair and skin soft.Pool maintenance used to be a headache, now its no problem."
2,Nothing but trouble!! Stick with chemicals!!,"I bought this based on all the info I got from Intex - low maintenance, easy to use, etc. I have hooked this thing up, followed all the instructions and it still gives me the 'low flow code' 90. The seller wont take this item back because thier policy is 'unopened' and 'unused' for returns, so now I am out $190 ( includes the shipping) on an item that doesn't work! This thing is real sensitive to anything like low flow or even the smallest amount of air in your hoses."
5,Book for chewer,Great book for a busy 7 month old who loves to put everything in his mouth! He also enjoys playing peekaboo with the mirror and face cover.
2,Amazing Baby soft book,"My baby just doesn't like it. She is 6 month old and she just ignoring this toy when I give it to her. She played with a ""bookmark"" couple of times but that's all. It has only 3 pages and it just doesn't get her attention. So sorry bacause I really thought she'd like it."
1,Concerns,"After receiving this attractive baby book I noted it was made in China. The paint on the cloth seemed very bright and thick. In remembering the news articles about bright, shiny paint used by the Chinese in painting children's toys, I just couldn't bring myself to give it as a baby gift to my nephew and his wife. I have opened it, but I don't feel good about giving it to Goodwill either. I may need to throw it away . . . though that is a sad thought also."
2,Steer clear of this Ed Sullivan Release!!,"When they originally aired this Sullivan Christmas Special on network television a few years ago, it was packed with oldie rock 'n roll clips as well as old Sullivan holiday clips. On the TV special were classic performances by Neil Diamond, the Animals, Petula Clark, Sam & Dave, etc etc. For some reason they wiped all of those great clips and left only the Christmas-oriented performances on the DVD release. On other Sullivan DVD releases, they released pretty much the same content as the TV specials. I cry FOUL on this one!!"
4,"Thunders, Hell, Nolan, Lure: the Early Months","A nice artifact: the early Heartbreakers with Richard Hell. For LAMFers, this is a must to fill the collection. For neophytes, well, come back to this when you've had some experience. The sound quality isn't so good, and the band was still teething, yet there is always Jerry Nolan to push things along, as well as Hell's weird charisma and Johnny's two-string sorcery--all in all a splendid find. Hearing Richard Hell sing ""Can't Keep My Eyes On You"" and Johnny harmonizing on Hell's stuff are an experience. Also, a freshly-broken-hearted-from-Sable-Starr version of ""Stepping Stone"" make this well worth the price."
3,Not as good as Moncrieff's translation,"I do not think this is the best translation of ""Swann's Way."" I revere Lydia Davis but the very qualities that make her a great writer of fiction -- her dry humor, her obsessive-compulsive observations, her fussy characters playing out their little existential scenarios on tiny stages -- make her unsuitable, temperamentally and stylistically, for the great symphony of Proust."
2,Life is too short,"It was time, I thought, to read Proust. Unfortunately, this has to be one of the most boring books ever. It's clear that it takes more dedication than I possess to make my way through such a plotless story. Maybe it's better in French."
3,I hated it.,I am glad I read this book. I appreciate its importance and influence on literature in general. Some of it was even interesting.I did not find it a hard read.I basically hated it. I hated dwelling for 600 pages in Proust's world.Thank God I've done it and it's over.
2,Interesting edition...,"To be fair, I purchased this book in a hurry, with a large order of other books, so I wasn't paying particularly close attention to the details of this edition when I placed the order. My mistake.Things you should know:1.) This book is HUGE. Not only is it a dense read, this edition is about the size of a coffee table book. Nothing you can take to Starbucks with you and casually read.2.) The cover ""art"" is not attractive; it's pretty much just a blown-up image of someone else's art. Pixels are clearly visible. So if you were so inclined, you wouldn't even want to put this on your coffee table to impress others with your intellect. It is an unattractive book.3.) This book is available free on Amazon kindle, so I suggest not buying this weird and overpriced edition and downloading it instead."
1,Unreadable,"This was not a book I could pick up and read. Although I read the intro and a study guide and was keenly anticipating reading one of the greatest books ever written, I was unable to. I read the first Combray twice and still did not understand sections I had read. I felt defeated, disappointed, and stupid. The book, for me, requires intense concentration - no distractions or noise while reading - a virtually impossible scenario in my world. After reading the synopsis in the back of the book I wasn't sure I would want to pursue this even in a study group or classroom situation. It sounded dry and boring and I'm not sure it would be worth the effort for me."
5,More of M.S. fantastic work,"More of the jaw droping pretty girl art from Shirow. Full page glossy promotional images glore! Guns, shiney girls, sci-fi environments, And even more fan service than Blades!If that's what you love about Shirow's work. This is for you!As a long time fan of this artist, I say you can't go wrong."
2,Not Impressed,The cover of my order arrived with a large cut across the entire front cover. I normally wouldnt be too upset about something like this but these books are expensive.
2,Did not realy enjoy it.,"""Shooter"" by Walter Dean Myers, is a book about a high school shooting. The main characters in the book are Leonard Gray, Cameron Porter, and Carla Evens. The troubled Leonard or Len, as he is called, commits the shooting after a troubled few months of his mom being abused and being bullied. He is finally driven over the edge. During these months he gets arrested for vandalizing a church with Cameron. They both were given counseling and put on prescriptions. Len got addicted to these drugs because he said he was in a depressed mood.This book relays the experience of how someone could attempt a shooting at their school and killing someone. I think that this book is not an appropriate book for younger children and was not very good."
3,Shooter,"If I had to choose one word to describe the book ""shooter"" by Waiter dean Myers, I would use is realistic. Because it seemed to be like real life. What I liked the gang or do Saggitae because it was weird .I liked the book ""shooter"" by Walter Dean Myer's for several reasons. The first was when Len talked about the rats in his head. Reason two was when Len and Cameron was shooting at each other.These are the reasons why like the book ""shooter"" by Walter Dean Myers. The reason why I didn't like the book ""shooter"" by Walt Dean Myers. The first was when Len put Carla records on the internet. The second is when Len's dad hit Len's mom. Overall, I would recommend the book ""shooter"" by Walter Dean Myers to my friend. The reasons for this are because it's realistic and a good book to read. Out of five stars, I would give it three."
2,I simply didn't like it,"I'm a huge Funkadelic fan, and I'm still getting into Praxis. This CD is 100% techno, so if you are into that kind of stuff, go ahead and buy it. I don't mind random electronic music (I'm also a big King Crimson fan), but the music on this CD is not the best quality, and it's really repetitive."
5,Excellent gift for children,Who doesnt love Bambi? I bought this for my grandchildren (5 and 7) but watched along with them remembering when I saw this as a child. Despite dating from 1944 the graphics were still beautiful and nothing looked dated in the film. Disney was getting it right all those years ago.
1,"Item was great, but not exactly as described","This listing was for a set of 6 books. I ordered it because I wanted all 6 books for my husband's Sunday School class. I only got 1 book, not 6. I emailed for a replacement and still only got 1 book. I waited a month or so to see if Amazon could fix their ordering problem and tried to order another set of 6 and only got 1 book. I was told it was the distributors problem, not Amazon's and they could do nothing for me. So, I got 3 books but never got the set of 6 I ordered. I paid the price for 6 books and only got 1. Beware when ordering a full set, you probably won't get it!"
5,a physician's perspective,"This book is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. It is equalled only by her second book, Sacred Poems and Prayers of Love. I am saddened to see that the book is out of print now, but am happy to see that the tape is available. The combination of Mary Ford-Grabowsky's selections, and Andrew Harvey's stunning reading should not be missed. I have given copies of this book and of the tape to some of my dying patients. They found it wonderfully comforting in their final hours. One woman also expressed to me how wonderful it was to have the book available to thumb through after her husband was gone -- she said it supported her through her immense grief. I anxiously await more from this author!"
4,"Amazing, but Brazilian Version with Claudia is the best of them all.","Paloma's vocals are amazing, I dare to say, having listened to ALL of the Evita's recordings and arrangements that she is the second best, because the first one ( better tham Patti and Elaine Page and even Paloma ) is Claudia Oliveira - the Brazilian actress that played Evita's role in 1982 and in 1986. The only one that sings with power and energy needed for the role. And in addition to that, Claudia is the only one that sings the ""one star quality"" phrase with amazing high notes, different from all others, that cannot reach such crystal and clean notes and just lower their voices to sing in a descendant scale... That's a shame they didn't remastered Claudia's recording. I love Paloma's recording but CLAUDIA IS THE BEST Evita theaters have seen and heard EVER!"
4,Experienced with testing.,"My opinion about this book is that this is very useful in order to learn about the facts that happens when you need to lead a group of testers, basically. To read this book you need a previous experience as a tester, in order to understand very clear the ideas. If you have this experience , great!!!!! The book is very very graphic about the facts that happens when you do your job as a testing leader."
5,Astonishing !!! Pure experience based knowledge shared to us.,As a test manager and tester for years I discovered recently this book. Astonishing how much it drives you to question yourself about methods accurate for YOUR testing project.Insightful to senior testers who find themselves in charge of a team or of a testing project.My testing will probably never be the same as I reread those advice and still try to find good question to ask myself to better my test.Great Book.
1,The Worst Book on Software Testing,"The authors admit the following (on page xxiii):1- ""This is NOT a comprehensive guide to software testing""2- ""This book is NOT a collections of lessons that are always true"" (!)3- ""Some lessons that have been usefull and important in our careers may NOT work for you. Use your own judgment"" (!!)4- ""This book is NOT a collection of best practices. We don't believe in best practices"" (!!)This is a real bad book. The only lesson you may have to learn is ""how to sell used books in auctions!"""
4,Good Stuff,This book is really readable and packed with practical information. Any reader is bound to walk away with something of real value and use. This book will certainly be staying close at hand for future reference.
2,Southern herb garden,I was disappointed to receive a book whose spine was not completely attached to the pages. The content of the book seemed to be helpful.
2,The Writer Who...,"...is too involved in things Scottish to turn out a book. I have been patient. I loved this series for over ten years, but as the wonderful old girl ages, Ms. Braun apparently mistakes readers of her mysteries for fellow Scottiphiles. Bring back the plot twists that force us to read until each page is devoured. Bring back the clever cat antics and Qwill's witty chatter. Please stop trying to convert us all to Scots. Enough is enough."
2,Not as entertaining as earlier Cat Who... books,"I was disappointed in the latest Cat Who... book. It is too predictable, and it ends abruptly. The story just didn't hold my interest. If it were the first Cat Who... book that I had read, I doubt that I would have pursued the others. Is the author growing tired of the characters? Do they need a change of locale? Qwill, Koko, and YumYum could go to Paris, perhaps!"
4,The Cat Who Changed a Little,"This book, although good, did not fully measure up to what I have come to expect from Ms. Braun. I agreed with some that she needs to bring back old characters who we have seen very little of in this latest Qwill update. The story seemed to lack her usual wit and conviction. However Ms. Braun did not deserve some of the unkind reviews given as it was an enjoyable book. Maybe it was different. Let us hope that with the next she will be back at her best."
2,This cat is nearing it's nineth and final life.,"I like my old slippers, my old robe, and the cat books. But eventually I will throw out the robe and slippers. I think it's time to retire the cat series too. Thank you for the memories, Lilian."
1,Thre Cat whoi robbed a Bank,I have enjoyed all the Cat Who Books . Have owned or borrowed or went to library to read them. Always can't wait for the next book to see what Koko and Yum Yum are up to. Have two of my own and think they are smart things to have.
2,really quite sad...,"I have been reading this series forever, and I think it's about time for the publisher to admit that Ms. Braun is no longer writing the series, or if she is still writing (which is highly doubtful considering the time frame of the entire series from book one) she is being aided by a ghostwriter. There is no possible way that this book could have been written by the same author who was writing the series five years ago. Very boring and cluttered with detail. Those of us who have come to know ""Qwill"" and his two cats feel a great loss within the pages of this book- their personality, humor, and warmth. The cats became merely grunting pets in this book- and that's the ""clue"" that Ms. Braun has passed on her pen. How truly sad :("
2,The Cat Who Disappointed a Reader,"I have read every Cat Who book written by this author, and I feel this is the weakest book in the series! All of the other books had twists and turns in the plot, and all of the other books had the ability to keep you guessing until the very end. Unfortunately, in this book, the author chooses to dwell on character development and background material. As a fan of the series, I did not need this additional information - I already love Qwill, Koko and Yum Yum, without knowing the ins and outs of Scottish games or mechanical banks! I hope that the next book in the series sees a return to a real mystery, and not just a walk down memory lane! If you have enjoyed the other books in this series, you will find this entry acceptable, but it will probably not be one of your favorites. If you have never read one of the Cat Who books, or if you have read only a few, I would recommend reading the earlier books before this one."
3,Close but no cigar. The Cat who Robbed a Bank,"Although the book was very well written and was very enjoyable, it was completely opposite ms. Braun's creative style. In fact, every single one of her books contradict the style in this book. It deprives you of the magnificance of her other books. In this one Qwill (James ""Jim"" Qwilleran) is practacly handed the clues to the crime. And also what outrages me about it is that THE CATS PLAY OFF STAGE AND QWILL GETS ALL THE LIMELIGHT! It's a semi-good book, but I would only recomend it if you were to read the whole series."
