1,Levi's Jeans are poor Quality,"I don't blame Amazon; but I blame Levis, the company. I bought two pair of these and within a day a belt loop easily ripped out of the material on one of them. Then, the replacement did the same. The company had better reconsider the decline in quality or they are done. I now do not trust the remaining pair. I wore Levis all of my life and I am shocked and annoyed at the decline in the quality of their jeans."
4,"Great fit, quality is decent","These are my jeans of choice and they fit well. My only real complaint about these jeans is that they wear out and get holes sooner than I think they should, considering I'm not very rough on them. It might also be nice to have more selection in colors."
5,Gift,This jeans were for my husband. They fit perfectly on him! I hope that the blue colour doesn't fade too quickly.
4,Good product!,"I love Levi's jeans! I'm a big, tall guy and these jeans fit well. I would've given them 5 stars but they were just a tad bit too long! I normally order my jeans the same inseam length (36"") but these fit longer than any other jeans I've ordered. I really don't mind though. The shipping was extremely fast and the packaging ensured my jeans arrived as if I had bought them out of the store. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with my purchase!"
3,Thin and tight pockets,"The fabric is very thin, and simple weave. The fabric thickness might be okay for small sizes, say 32"" or smaller, but is disproportionate for anyone bigger. These are very much NOT work pants.Also, it's very tight in the front for pocket access. These are more designed to show off your rear than to be comfy.I recommend the 569 ""Loose Fit"" style, or Wranglers' Relaxed Fit for comfortable daywear with a little fabric heft."
5,Loved them,These jeans were perfect for my husband. We have had such a hard time finding his size in a color that he likes. These worked out great.
3,Value for money,"I was a bit nervous about the fit but it turned out to be perfect. However, the quality of fabric is nowhere near what it used to be (I still use a pair that I had purchased eleven years ago). Time will tell!!"
5,Good Jeans,Worn 550 jeans since I was 16 (34 now). Tried a few other brands over the years but always come back.
3,Just O.K.,These jeans are nicely made. I tried them just to be different from the 501's. I'll stick to the fit of 501's from now on. A little to baggie for me.
2,They don't Fit !,"I bought these for my husband. This is his pant size. The cut was off on both pairs. The pants had a short crotch, the distance between the bottom of the zipper and the horizontal seam above the pockets, and a low waist, they seemed to have been cut for a boy or very trim young man. He wears jeans almost every day, none of the other major manufacturers have this problem and in fact the Levi signature brand have a better fit."
5,"W33L36, colour ""Inspector""","My husband has worn Levi's jeans since 1998. Unfortunately, this company can't keep the same level of quality. By the way, not only quality of jeans.But this opinion about the Levi's 550 W33L36, colour ""Inspector"". The denim is not heavy, a little thin and it's ok in this case, because it was bought for warm season. The fit is good, the colour is good. But this jeans loose colour a little fast, I think.W33L36 is a size which you seldom can find, so if there are some not standard colors, it's the way to make feel good for thin and tall men.My husband had worn this jeans 2-3 times a week from may until september. He likes it very much. This jeans make to feel comfortable and it looks not too wide at the same time. He wants to buy the same and also may be another color."
4,Basic and comfortable.,"Over the years I have tried different models of Levis and prefer the relaxed fit of the 550 over the rest. Of course this is simply a matter of personal preference on how you want your jeans to fit.I agree with other reviewers in that the material has gotten thinner. In my opinion this is not necessarily a bad thing. The thinner material makes for a lighter weight and even more comfortable jean. It will just take time and many washings to see if these jeans hold up and last as long as the older and thicker Levis.Overall I am happy with these jeans. Although, if I want a heavy and warmer jean then I buy LL Bean."
4,good fit,"the jeans fit well and are comfortable. have not washed them yet, but hope for lots of use out of them."
3,Not like the old days!,"These are just ok. What happened to quality control?? In the old days Levi's were made in America and the quality of finish and the quality of material was excellent and reliable. Now when you buy Levi's (made in umpteen 3rd world countries with no quality control?) the fit is very hit and miss and the material is THIN, THIN, THIN!"
2,jeans,returned these jeans because the did not fit as I would have liked. could had a little more room in the rear
4,Thank you,My husband loved these as we can not find pants to fit him in the stores... he is too tall...
5,Fast Delivery and True Fit,I ordered on a Sunday and had the product on Thursday. Levi's in my size are a challenge (impossible) to find at stores in this area (Pasadena) but the wide variety of sizes and styles made it simple. The price was great too.Amazon for Levi's is the only way to go.
1,poor quality,"jean were 2"" to long on arrival - whats the deal with quality control here from the plant ex mexico where these are clearly made to order?"
1,DIAMOND GUSSET JEANS Made in the USA,"I am always looking for products made in the USA, these jeans are about the same price as most other jeans and are worth every penny. All of us need to try to buy american made products and stop the flow of monies to China oor where ever else it goes, keep an american working while you are buying a quality product."
1,Not Relaxed at All,"These pants were WAY too tight. They come in the size I ordered, but I have never had a pair of pant this tight. I would have to order two times my size for these jeans to fit."
3,Lacking Quality Control,"I got a pair of these the other day. The bottom tip of the right front pocket was riveted to the top of the pocket, essentially making the pocket useless, or half useless. I had to cut the pocket away and sew the tip of the pocket back together. I figured this was easier than shipping it back to Amazon and getting another pair."
2,Paper thin jeans,"I purchased these 550 jeans based on the superb wear I had from my previous 550's. Six years ago I purchased five pair of these jeans from A&N and have worn them weekly to work. Those jeans were thick and heavy. I expected these new jeans, labeled also as 550's, to be of the same quality. These new jeans are paper thin as you would expect of jeans half the price. So, if you like your jeans to be thinner than your PJ's for lounging then these might be for you. But for work jeans I'll be surprised if they last a year."
1,Low Quality,"Manufactured overseas. Levis jeans are now made with no quality control,the result are a pair of jeans I returned."
2,Nasty looking Jean and very thin,NOT happy with these jeans at all!They look like someone has worn them for a year and never washed them. The material is 1/4 the thickness of any other jean I have ever purchased. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE JEANS TO ANYONE.
4,Comfortable and Rugged,"Good, serviceable jeans that can work for kicking around or low business casual. They did seem to run a little longer than I had hoped and didn't shrink much in the wash."
5,"Quality jeans, good fit.","Exactly what I expected, these are comfy jeans with a good weight to them. I ordered every available color in my size and couldn't be happier."
4,Gift,A gift for my brother he loved them 36 in inseam are hard to find in stores but these was a great fit at a good price.
3,Nice jeans,It's hard to find black jeans in most stores. I found them in one department store but they didn't have my size. I tried The Gap but they don't carry this style. I gave up and ordered them online. They're what you'd expect for jeans. This model has a zipper fly and a relaxed fit.
1,what's the problem,Everytime you order Levi's they can be from another country. What happened to the USA??? Every country makes them different. Why is that? They never fit the same or do not fit at all. Will never order on line again and will be sending these back. The ones from Mexico are great and the ones from Egypt are to small!!
1,What size are they really.,"I've been wearing 550 relaxed fit for years. I have a drawer full of old 550s all the same size and they all fit the same. I received a new pair for Christmas in the same size I always wear and they don't even come close to fitting. They are labelled 34W 32L, but the waist is more like a 30 and the length is more like a 34. I looked at the tag for where they are made, and it says ""Lesotho."" Do they use a different form of measurement in that part of Africa? If a company is going to risk their reputation on cheap labor, they should at least initiate some quality control. If you are going to buy jeans from Levi, don't count on them being sized properly."
1,Belt loops defective,Bought oct 2011 and by jun 2012 two belt loops have popped and torn holes in the body... Totally poor quality control... And at nearly full price...not worth it at all...
1,"amazon sells levis ""seconds""","i have bought levi's 550 jeans, 44x32 from many places, sears, penney, macy, boscov, etc, and all are regular levis quality. this pair i bout from amazon are definitely not of the same quality and definitely not the same fit as levi's jeans bought elswhere. i believe these are factory rejects sold at this site."
1,Very thin material,"One star for Levi's 550's, five stars for Amazon customer service!I recently ordered two pairs of 550's from Amazon, expecting the same quality they've always had. Eh, not so much. First thing I noticed when I took them out was the thin material. They don't feel like jeans, more like Dockers chinos. Also I noticed the stitching wasn't particularly tight. I returned both pairs for full refund (thanks Amazon!)."
3,"Great looking item, a little pricey","I bought these for my uncle around Thanksgiving for Christmas, thinking I got a good price. Unfortunately when I got to looking I found places where they had them for half the price I paid. I like the look, but like I said a little on the pricey side."
2,Cheap Material,"I have purchased other Levi's jeans from Amazon that were of good quality, but these were not. The material is much thinner than most denim pants. They are obviously made of a cheaper material than most Levis. Not sure how this happens, but at least with these pants, I would not recommend buying them."
5,great gift,"Great product - can Levi be anything but - great fit, great Christmas gift. It was received before the expected date which was amazing. Amazon is my favorite shopping center."
4,Great,Great to be able to order an uneven size. Not as pleased with the colors. Hard to determine from computer screen. Overall great service
5,"these jeans arrived today, yay!",My husband is long waisted and these jeans fit him perfectly! I highly recommend this product to everyone interested in blue jeans.
4,Levi Jeans for men,"Great jeans. Levis are an American tradition that just keeps getting better. 550's are greatEasy to wash, easy to wear."
4,Classic good Levi Fit,If Levi's fit well for you than these are a very nice pair. I like how Levi jeans fit me. They are the right length in the upper part of the leg. I like the feel of the material.
4,550 Jeans fit great!,"Great price, great fit. Levi's jeans are the best. I've tried all other brands and they never fit as well as Levi's."
3,belt loop broke,Belt loop broke 2nd week into having these and hardly worn. I called Levis and sent them back to them for examination. Still waiting to hear back from them
2,Inferior Material and Stitching,"I have worn Levi's jeans for years, but the last several pair I have purchased are not very durable. The material and stitching are inferior to jeans of the same model/style purchased in years past due to Levi's cost cutting measures. I have now switched to Lee Premium Select jeans which are available in cuts and styles similar to Levi's, but are more durable with better material and stitching and also less expensive. So I now bid farewall Levi's!!!"
3,The fit has changed,"I have ordered these jeans, same size for years and for some reason, the fit is different. They are labelled relaxed, but the waist is tighter than I like. I think going up a size would be too big. I looked at the tags on my old ones and they are made in Bangladesh. The new ones say made in Egypt. I agree with the folks here saying that they need to work on quality control, at least in the sizing department."
5,great fit,"it is great having the chance to buy clothes online. this pants just makes it. soft cotton, great quality. and I don't need to try them on. I know they will fit perfectly."
3,Waist too tight,"These 550 relaxed fit jeans look good, but the waist was way too tight. Levi's jeans shorts ordered about the same time -- same waist size -- fit perfectly. Go figure -- and so much for the relaxed fit. Items like jeans that can be tricky to fit may be best purchased in a retail store where you can try then on. These 550's are on their way back to Amazon."
3,thin material and tight fit,"The material is thinner than the Lee premium select jeans and the ""relaxed"" fit is a bad description. The waist is actually 33"". Other jeans with a 34"" waist I can easily fit my hand in the pockets but with the 550 it is a tight fit even for my phone."
1,Quailty? Not with these jeans,"I bought these jeans less then 3 weeks ago and I knew right away these were not the Levi's quality I was used to. The material is MUCH thinner than every other pair of Levi's I've owned. Then after only two or three uses, the belt loop broke. You've got to be kidding. Are these jeans made just for Amazon becuase I ve never seen such junk in retail stores.Levi's Men's 550 Relaxed Fit Jean"
2,Been a Levis customer for 30 years...no more,"I'm tired of the lax quality control.When I try on Levis in stores, several pairs of the exact same size will be very different.When I recently ordered several of 550s in my size from Amazon, they were all a much tighter cut than they used to be. I wear the exact size of 550s every day comfortably, and the new ones were all cut like the ""Regular Fit"" and not ""Relaxed Fit"".My brand loyalty is gone. Levis ruined a good thing in the typical corporate greed and lack of care about product or customers. On to LL Bean most likely."
2,Degrading trend,I purchased two pairs of Levis 550 jeans. I had a belt loop on each pair rip out within 3 months. Their quality is not what it once was.
1,"Unacceptable, inferior quality.","The fabric is inferior and not the standard Levis fabric or quality. I have three pairs of older Levis in my closet and the new ones do not measure up to those. After using the first pair that I ordered from Amazon, I returned the second and cancelled the order for the third.If I have a repeat of this experience with another purchase from Amazon, I will have to consider not making other purchases."
2,"Location, Location, Location","Fit is everything in jeans. Different brands are for different body types, similar to shoes. I've purchased and worn dozens and dozens of Levis 501s & 550s over last 40 years. When they were made in the USA you could identify the factory and know what cut and fit to expect. The stonewashed jeans only shrank over a long period of time. Then there was Mexico and Egypt. Both different. Now, the last pairs purchased from Amazon came from Haiti. This is not a commentary on the Haitian people. This is a commentary about jeans. The Haitian jeans [stone washed] are cut oddly and shrink with one washing [The same sizes from Egypt ran large]. The fabric may vary and be thinner than yesterdays' jeans, but the real issue is fit. Levis have become very hard, if not impossible to depend on."
2,Denim not what it used to be,"The first thing that I noticed when I got two new pair of Levi's was the fabric quality; much thinner than the last several pairs that I purchased a few years ago, and thinner than other name brand jeans that I have purchased recently inlcuding Nautica and Lands End.Then the second time I wore the 550's a belt loop tore clean through the denim, leaving a hole and a flapping belt loop. I've never had that happen on any other pair of jeans that I have owned.The fit is still great on Levi's jeans, but cutting costs by cutting thread count or fabric durability doesn't make any sense...remember all those Levi's adds touting how tough the jeans have been since they were original made for 49ers? I guess outsourcing all your manufacturing does have a cost after all...."
3,Black Levis jeans,"PRO: Nice product, will wear it to work everyday. Fabric is not so thick but fairly good quality. Arrived on time. Could be $5.00-$10.00 cheaper. I guess the LEVIs name has some value to it. The color is very black and not faded as the picture implied. Over time and many washes it will eventually fade (or bleach it out slightly). The overall fit is excellent. It's not one of those fancy jeans that fits too short or weird. Very comfortable to wear.CON: I could get a COSTO (Kirkland brand) w/c is a better quality for less. Anyway I am generally happy with the purchase."
5,Good Jeans,"Worth the money. Good fit, good color, very good wear. Holds up well to work and also looks good for casual wear."
5,Good Value,"These are my husband's favorite jeans! He typically has a hard time finding jeans that properly fit, since most brands seem to be made for the tall and lanky fellow or prepubescent girls. The cut is generous without being baggy and very flattering on the fuller man."
1,Very disappointed,these jeans were 1 - 1.5 in. shorter in the crotch than the same jeans I purchased from another retailer several months prior.
5,Christmas gift for my brother,"The stitching looked well-made and the jeans were starch-stiff. They still fit true to size and are rugged, unlike some of the newer Levi styles."
4,nice jeans,"The jeans were nice, thought they ran a little small, though. Usually they stretch some when worn and my son said they would be okay so kept them."
2,"Review of 550 Relaxed Fit Jean, Inspector","Apparently ""Inspector"" means what I call distressed. Going to return them as my son does not want the faded look on his Levi's"
5,Hubby's butt,"My husband has an odd inseam (31) and it's difficult to find jeans that are exactly right. These are great. Fit is perfect and really makes his butt look good..lol Oh, yeah, and he likes them too!!!"
3,Not as rugged as they once were!,"I have been wearing Levi jeans almost exclusively for 25+ years and while they are still good quality jeans It is obvious that the quality of the denim is not as rugged the past few years.. They are still confy, good looking classic jeans, but they wear out alot faster than they once did.What were once the best most iconic jeans around are now merely good."
5,Reviews helped me so I want to give back.,"Everyone loves Levi's and these are no exception. My husband is a big, heavy man and these fit him perfectly. He is so happy which of course, makes me happy, too!"
5,Levi's 550 Relaxed Fit Jeans STONEWASH,Received in excellent time and was just as described.Would purchase again.Thank you
5,Wrong item received but corrected immediately,"The product is just a Levi 550 jeans, which most people are familiar with. They came from the Charleston Department Store in Charleston, West Virginia. I originally received Levi 560 jeans in error but when I called them, they sent the correct ones immediately along with a pre-paid UPS envelope to return the incorrect ones. A good experience overall."
4,Exactly what I wanted,"I got these jeans for my husband for Christmas, they came in quickly, the sizing and color was exactly as described."
2,Son found too tight,"My son found this to be too tight as compared to another pair in the same size. Gave back to me to late to return,"
5,Love these,"Great jeans for a middle-aged guy. I've bought about 10 pair over the years--they're the only jeans I wear. Really comfortable, but not too baggy."
1,I hate shoping.,My wife returned my jeans and then whent to Sears and bought the same pair of pants for about $10.00 cheaper.
5,"Good Quality, Nice Fit",Ordered these jeans so I can have another pair when I went away for the weekend. Good quality and comfortable and fit better than some more expensive jeans that I have had.
2,the sizes are wrong,"good material, good design, except that you should order the next size to yours, if you do not leave anything to the imagination, made in Egypt"
2,Misfit Jeans,"Its hard to buy clothing online as most people know, I ordered these jeans knowing my size in levis, but they ended up not fitting even close, so there you have it, but Amazon did send me a label to easily return them without penalty or cost."
1,Not So Sure,"Hmm...I ordered these Levi's jeans online because it's hard/impossible to find a waist size of 35"" in stores. I've worn Levi's my entire life, and I've never before experienced this texture of fabric. It's like a softer, brushed denim, and I don't like them. I don't wear the jeans."
2,Bad quality,The colors are more of a yellow/brown rather than white and black and are printed on flimsy paper. I would not recommend this product.
2,"Notice keyword ""wrinkles"" in other reviews","It wrinkles like no other fabric I've ever seen in my life. Even after ironing, it will never, ever look anywhere near what it does in the picture, and there is no sateen feel to it. If you think about it, how can something be so wrinkly and feel sateen?I recommend you spend about $10 more and get something made with Egyptian cotton."
3,Good Sheets,These are good sheets - nice and soft but they are a little wrinkly. I think with time they will get better but for now they have a lot of wrinkles. Doesn't bother me because the price was just right!!
2,Okay for the price,"Wrinkled no matter how I wash them. They are soft, but don't feel very substantial. They feel like they didn't cost very much, even though the thread count is high. Wouldn't purchase again."
3,"Not terrible, not great","Well, thread count isn't everything. These sheets are not as soft (not even close) as the 330TC Egyptian Cotton ones I got about 10 years ago. Those were also about twice the price. If you are coming from 200TC percale or something, you'll probably like these much better. Guess I'm a bit spoiled now. :("
1,Poor workmanship,The hem is so uneven that it cannot be ironed flat or even near flat. The only way the top sheet can be used is to tuck the top hem under at the foot of the bed.
3,Disappointed,"The sheets were very soft until they were washed. After washing they were very rough. I didn't mind the wrinkles, who cares if they are wrinkled. I did however expect them to keep their softness."
3,Better for children than adults,"I was given this game as a gift, but my wife and I found it fairly simple and a little boring to play. Basically, you flip over cards quickly and if you need them you add them into your hand. The trick is you have to pay attention to a path and remember the path you took as you gather the cards into your hand without looking back at what you have already gathered. We both agreed the game would be better suited for older children (6-10) and we would probably have enjoyed playing with them. However, for adults it was a little too simplistic."
2,Any Thing But Advanced Hostage Rescue,"I purchased the video to learn more about Hostage Rescue operations, but what I got from it was an advertisement for SOS Temps Inc. Basically the video interviews Richard Marckino (Ret.Navy Seal), and his company he formed called SOS Temps Inc. I learn little, if not anything from this video."
5,Superb book for managers,"Wolf Rinke's latest book is a great addition to his collection of well-received books and and personal improvement products. ""Winning Management"" clearly shows the reader what must be done to excel in management. This is a practical guide to success on the job and can be used easily by any supervisor at any level of an organization. My copy is well-used!Having seen Dr. Rinke present his strategies for success as a seminar leader and author, and also having heard the outcomes of his plans of action, I know that he can positively and quickly affect your success at work."
5,"Smart, Creative, Moving, Great Trailer Park Musical","One of the best Off-Broadway shows I have ever seen. Thank god for this recording. The songs are smart and some even moving, funny and make you feel like you're in the theatre. Def. a great buy for every theater lover. A MUST HAVE."
4,"Saw the show, and love the CD","My husband and I saw this show in NYC and thought it was very funny! Of course, we are from Florida, and know all about Ole' Sparky, the electric chair. Florida certainly has more than its share of trailer parks, too. The show had a fabulous set, with all the trailers, and the cast was very talented in this cute, nervy, show. I loved the way they did ""Road Kill"" so low tech with two women with flashlights as the headlights, and a steering wheel harnessed and strapped around the guy's waist. Corny but funny stuff. Had a few little digs in it, too. Maybe I'm sick, but I liked it, a lot."
3,Just Okay,"I was all excited to find a honey almond scent thinking it would smell so yummy!! I saw it on here, then I found it at the store so I bought it. Turns out, it actually smells a lot like shampoo. I've asked several others what they think of the scent and they all say it's like shampoo, too. So I'd say skip this one and find something else more pleasing and unique."
2,Don't buy at Adorama,I haven't got this product because it took forever to Adorama to ship it.Being over seas it is very expensive to buy from Adorama because all the other things I buy get there on time except what I buy from Adorama so I end up paying a lot for what I buy there.
3,Looks nice but on closer inspection...,"The mailbox arrived more quickly than I expected. It looks great from a distance but upon closer inspection, several areas were missing green paint. I contacted the seller and received a response the same day of my initial inquiry - which I felt was excellent customer service. They offered to give me a 50% refund + refund the cost of shipping (or I could get a replacement mailbox). Given the hassle of returning an item, I opted for the refund. While the item wasn't the greatest, the company was fantastic. The item was probably 2 stars but the customer service was 5 stars. I settled for giving them 3 stars altogether."
2,Paint is very poor,"Box seems well constructed but the paint wears off and scratches very easily. A 'post it' note on the box pulled the paint off and other areas it has worn off. Going to contact the manufacturer to see if any touch up paint, but I do not plan on buying another one of these mailboxes."
4,Great Overview,An excellent overview of the evolving movement towards green development. The book is somewhat dated and lacks in-depth coverage in some areas. Regardless effectively gets you into the space.
4,Well up to Satoh's series standards.,"This is a very enjoyable disc and should not disappoint anyone new to De Visee's work. Anyone collecting each volume of the Satoh series on Channel label will be pretty pleased with the performances here and they are well-worthy of the high standards set by Satoh to date.However, those who are familiar with Hopkinson Smith's superb disc on Astree label will note that there is a degree more fantasy that can gleaned from De Visee's works than Satoh gives us. But it is worth noting that Smith plays theorbo only, while Satoh also gives us the brighter textures of lute and guitar.While much French baroque lute music can be a maze for puzzled listeners, De Visee is rather more accessible and is a good starting point for this repertoire.Satoh's disc gives a far preferable impression of De Visee than Monteilhet's dull effort on Virgin Veritas."
4,R. Waterhouse,Interesting thing about this book is the that it's written by an Australian with a PhD from J.Hopkins.
2,meat,"this thing tasted like a salami rolled in italian seasoning, its still in my fridge because no one will eat it..."
1,Don't bother!,I never even got past the first 15 minutes. A waste of my money and the time I spend trying to find anything funny in this.
1,waste of time,"Weak, with no information on the page to help you make a decision on the contents. Page should have additional information."
1,A bit of a disappointment,"I was looking for something to supplement Kaplan & Norton ... some different Strategy Map illustrations, etc. This book had been recommended by an acquaintance who had heard the author speak. I found the text to be somewhat rambling (almost like a folksy mind dump) and loosely structured. The examples and illustrations I was looking for weren't there. Maybe you had to hear the author speak."
4,Good Know How for inexperience colsultants,"As we are trying to build up the Balance Scorecard in our company, we have read the material published by Norton and Kaplan and also we had trainig on BSC as well.We have found this book useful because of the experience that the author transfer for new consultants that are in the begining of building up the strategy map and the scorecard, full of theory but no practice at all."
5,Misty Embrace,"Very well written, entertaining and enlightning. It is a very nicely written love story that tears at the heart. I hope Judy keeps writing for a long long time."
4,Fine Single Featuring a Rare B-side!,"""Blood Makes Noise"" and ""Bad Wisdom"" are fine tracks from Suzanne Vega's great 1992 ""99.9F"" album. To my knowledge the third song ""Men Will Be Men"" has not been released anywhere else than on this rare single. Being a big fan of Vega, I have now succeeded in getting hold of the single and though ""Men Will Be Men"" is nice enough, it is not really very memorable."
5,.....,"New! Statue in the Book of Daniel pamphletThe Four Kingdoms and God's Eternal KingdomThis fascinating wall chart and pamphlet give a fantastic summary of King Nebuchadnezzar's dream in the second chapter of Daniel-* Head of gold Babylon Lion* Chest and arms of silver Medo-Persia Bear* Middle and thighs of bronze Greece Leopard* Legs of iron and feet of iron and clay Rome BeastGod told Daniel that He would set up a kingdom that would destroy all of the other kingdoms and would never come to an end. Jesus said, ""The Kingdom of God is at hand.""The illustration of the statue is based on a carving of King Nebuchadnezzar's grandson, Nabonidus. It is the most accurate representation of the Babylonian style of art. Pamphlet is great for students. Fits inside a Bible cover: 8.5"" x 5.5"" and unfolds to 33"" long."
5,Phenomenal,This cd is brilliant. Not only are these ladies gifted and annointed but they are very beautiful and deffinately talented. May God continue to bless you all with the wonderful music you keep bringing to your fans.Love ya Twinkie.
4,My daughter loves it,"Bought this for my daughter to replace one of the figures we lost a few months ago. She loves playing with the mini dolls more than the bigger dolls. She is only 2. I put away all the small parts, she can play with them when she is older. But, the dolls are great for little fingers and imaginative play. The item clearly states the size of the item, so unless you don't pay close attention, then you might be surprised to find that these are miniatures. The price is great and much cheaper than what is in the stores."
1,HUGE disappointment!!,"My 4 yr old daughter received this as a gift. She loves Strawberry Shortcake and was so excited to get this set. However, once we opened it, we were very disappointed. As someone else mentioned, this set is about as good as a Happy Meal toy. The handlbars fell off the scooter immediately and I was afraid my 18 month old would choke on them. A few other pieces fell off also. Needless to say, this toy is already in the garbage after not even a days worth of play out of it. There are other SS items that would be great gifts, this is not one of them."
2,Disappointment,"My 3 year old daughter already has an adorable 2.5"" Strawberry Shortcake set with lots of pieces and lots of room for imaginary play. She loves it, but it only came with one doll. I've searched for the individual 2.5"" dolls but to no avail, so out of exasperation, I bought this set so that SS could have a friend. While the extra dolls were exactly what I was looking for, the rest of the set was a complete disappointment. There are only two pieces in addition to the dolls and their hats, and they are nothing more than kids meals toys. She was SO disappointed when none of the pieces came apart for play that she almost cried. I ended up taking the scooter and the cake off the platforms so that she could play with them and threw the rest away."
5,one armed against nine killers,This film is excellent... anyone interested in martial arts will love this movie... and there's a secret special suprise at the end that makes it worth the price of admission! Higly recommended!
1,Died after couple of days-wasted my money,"I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it). After couple of days, when I tried to charge it again, it did not work. It still does not work. I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway. In store purchase is better for such product where I could easily take back.The bottom line, don't waste your dollars and give it a homeless guy."
5,Excelente condition....,This piece not have any problem and work perfectly....Trabaja de mil maravillas y en exelente condicion... ;)Good Look (SuerteX)
1,USED!!! AND BAD!!!!,"It supouse to be brand new, but when arrive home it was used, crashed and doest work well!!!!! so, i expend my money and time!!!!"
1,Poor Substitute,This mirror is a piece of junk. Remote control shaft that knob secures to is very poorly designed and weak. Hard to adjust mirror. Spend the extra bucks and buy Toyota OEM not this cheap immitation. Big difference in quality of mechanism.
3,I'm Amazed,"Maybe it's because I read the book before I saw the movie, but I was disappointed with the film version of this story.If you liked the movie, and judging by the reviews many do, do yourself an immense favor and read the book. Not only will you get the REAL true story, complete with pictures, letters and more, but you'll get a sweeping and poignant impression of botht the era and this tender love story."
5,Beautiful Acting / Beautiful Story,"This movie just plain breaks your heart, but it's worth the emotional journey. With characters that are vividly brought to life against a cruel backdrop of war and bigotry, the movie shines because it never compromises on its characters. All of the characters are rich and three dimensional - Nazi, Jew, and German alike. There's Jaguar's boss, a Jew-hating Nazi with a surprisingly sweet and good-natured side. There's Aimee's husband, who can be both sweet and cruel at the same moment. And then there's the main characters - characters who are flawed, but in love with each other in spite of AND because of those flaws. I highly recommend the DVD because it contains interviews with the original Aimee and pictures of the couple from World War II."
1,AHA-BUCK are rip-off's,"AHA-BUCK are thugs yo, they sold me a german film thathas no english subtitles. In thier ad it did not display if it did or did not have subtitles in my opinion thats trickery, next time i'm only buying from american sellers.When i E-mailed AHA-BUCK they sent me a negative response stating to buy at you're own risk. Dont trust them they dont have respect for us buyers, and thier prices are too high i only bought from them because i trust amazon.com."
4,Sad but true,"Excellent movie, and worth all the rave. It tears the guts right out of you when... hmmm.. sorry, buy it and find out for yourself. I'd have liked a longer and more graphic love scene between the women, but I guess too much to ask for from a masterpiece. Watch a good softcore ... flick (ala ""Good Bye Emma Jo,"") then this, and you'll be good to go :-D"
4,Richard and permissive Universal produce another compilation,"Like the other reviews state, this product is soley for the purpose of compiling songs composed by Richard, the lyrics by various writers, namely John Bettis. There is nothing new here really, the remix of ""One Love"" was up until now available only on the Japanese import album ""By Request."" Most of the older songs in the remix versions presented here are available on the boxed set ""The Essential Carpenters."" The song ""At The End Of A Song"" makes it's first appearance on a release since it's inclusion on ""Voice Of The Heart."" This project is a companion piece to 1995's ""Interpretations,"" that set featuring all the Carpenters ""covers."" The mastering of these songs is updated since the album remasters in 1998 and '99, so the songs here are a bit cleaner. Outside of the sound, nothing is new about this project, sad to say, unless liner notes are worth collecting."
3,Time for a remix,"On one hand I'm happy that Richard keeps the Carpenters name alive to new audiences with these regular compilation CDs; however, I agree with other comments here that it's time to invest some money to scrap the 1970s arrangements and update the music tracks with something more contemporary and more complex. No doubt his own voice is deeper and richer now, so he might want to go back and overdub his own tracks again. Rich--if you're reading this, maybe you should hook up with the brilliant arranger & composer William Goldstein. I also think it would be fun to have an album of top name instrumentalists do some of the solo bridge spots: Herb Alpert, Earl Klugh, Kenny G, Glen Campbell (Guitar), Barry Manilow (Piano), etc."
3,Oh Yawn Oh Yawn.,"How many more times is Dick Carpenter going to regurgitate released recordings..is he aiming for an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records for countless compilations? Does he need more cash to feed his ever growing family? Hmm..I think not. Following the death of Agnes Carpenter, he is probably the sole beneficiary of Karen's sizaeble estate.I recall seeing a Carpenters TV documentary some years ago here in the UK. Richard stated that, following the release of the 4 CD box set, there were no more unreleased recordings to come. Liar liar pants on fire! We then see the release of a CD dedicated to unreleased tunes. Any Carpenters fan knows full well that there must be reels of unreleased gems in the A & M vaults. So does us all a favour Dick, and release something that is worth buying for the Carpenters fan, and stop rehashing old material.IT GETS A BIT BORING AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF IT."
2,Good Story Line - Horrible editing,"This novel has an interesting story line but is barely readable because of extremely awkward sentence structure, misuse of words, using wrong words (example: encite instead of insight) etc.If you are not bothered by such, you will probably enjoy the book. I managed to finish it but lack of proper editing bugged me all the way."
4,"Excellent, worth watching","I first got hooked onto El-Hazard through the TV series version, rather than the OVA series. All I can say is, wow, and I don't regret watching a single episode. It's got humor, some action, and best of all great personalities among the characters. While the TV series is good, I felt that the first OVA did a better job (especially in plot and humor), but both are still worth watching."
5,Greatest Movie Ever,"City of God was undeniably the best movie I have ever seen in my life. The cinematography was outstanding. After I saw this movie I could not stop talking about it, I knew I would have to own it as soon as it was released on dvd. This movie is a must see and I recommend that if you like movies you will love City Of God."
3,A good watch,My friend was moving to Brazil until she watched this movie!!! Just kidding.. she lives there now. We enjoyed it.
2,The Devil's Disciples,"328 Reviews of this movie is way more than enough. I am adding to that number only as a means of supporting those few brave souls who found this cleverly choreographed mayhem devoid of morality and humanity. It was good to see so many of them wiped out as the film progressed. The trouble is that it is difficult to tell who kills whom. All of these cardboard pastiches look alike, think alike and act alike. It could have been worse: it might have been made in Hollywood."
3,the emperor's new clothes,"i'm sorry, i just don't see a masterpiece here. even though all these poor children are murdered, in a world that doesn't care, the character developement in this movie was so poor that in the end, i didn't care either. this film might as well be a documentary because it makes little use of the power of art to incite our emotions. it did convey a feeling of hopelessness i guess and maybe that was the point, but it could have done so much more."
1,"Stupid, Sadistic, Boring, Depressing","I can't understand all those glowing reviews on this movie. Surely, I will have idiots that will criticize me for not liking this OVERLY violent movie, is beyond me.The violence was too much. Shooting left and right, pretty much the entire movie.The sadistic way that the main character was laughing when he was going to shoot a crying, terrified child is sick to my stomach. How can people like seeing that crap?I don't need to see these type of scenes to see what goes in a favela.The story line was that a guy made out of the favela in these type of horrible conditions. But the excessive violence killed the interest for me.I didn't even want my family to walk in on me watching this movie.I guess I have to keep searching for a good Portuguese movie."
2,good video,i had no idea this was not in English but because i liked the movie anyways i decided to keep it. pretty interesting way of writing a script. just wish it was English.
4,A foreign gempiece,"I positively loved this movie.From start to finish, this is a story that boldly demands100% of the viewer's attention and never disappointsthroughout the entire run. Even in spite of the gratuitiousviolence, this film is somehow able to come acrossas a foreign masterwork; not because some Hollywoodbigwigs have decided to patronize and endorse the ""foreignflavor of the moment,"" but simply because this is anincredible story in and of itself. The great cast, excellent camera work, and infectious Brazilian music only amplifythe cinematic perfection that is ""City of God.""This movie will be a great addition to any collection.It's a winner.Seriously."
5,A movie to show how absolute poverty can affect lives,"I personally found the movie to be very sad but interesting. The cinematography was beautiful and the characters acted well even though many of the cast were not professional actors. As to you Brian Kerecz, there was a portrayal of working-class Brasilenos (see Rocket's parents at the first part of the movie) but in countries like Brazil ""working-class"" people are often still poverty stricken.....also these characters were based on real people if you caught that at the end. This movie was not set out to degrade or exploit Brazil, but maybe we need to know that there is more to this beautiful country than beaches and carnival...and unfortunately it is not always so beautiful."
5,Movie blew my mind away,"Don't read the review of the movie, it will ruin the experience. Just buy it and watch it. This is a heavy and sad and violent movie."
5,Not an easy movie to watch....,"...but outstanding in its depiction of a place so at odds with our own Disneyfied, suburban existence.It's easy to get somewhat myopic in how one sees the world. Movies like this are in your face reminders that there are billions of people who live in completely different circumstances, with different values, and that the biggest concern isn't paying for that new iPod or getting far enough ahead financially to get that second home, but sheer survival. Anyone who has kids has to shudder at the plight of the Runts, a band of feral kids who rob and kill in the City of God. There but for the grace of God go we. It definitely makes you grateful for what you have......."
4,about this film City Of God..............,"This film basically talks about the story of killers/bad people that comes from Brazil which later end up in drug business and later shot of kids with multple gun shot whom so called try to take over the power from the bad guy.....ver nice film.....this film is basically about bad society problem that deals with how bad people live and leas their daily life of business in a country.......very nice film and I give it a 4 star for its good performace to prove to the public on the life of bad people/kilers.Review by:Dr, MR FRanc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon KahDirector Ron Howard - Ang Poon Kah for film Angels and DemonsAssistant FED chief (Internationale)"
4,very compelling,this film brings alot of action and it tugs at your heart as it has strong content. film is street and very real and i saw it the other night and it was disturbing but it kept your attention from start to finish. a strong film that breaks into several parts and themes.time periods.
5,Graphic but amazing.,"This film was absolutely amazing. Though parts of it were quite graphic and may not be appropriate for all viewers, the truth it held was incredible. It will really open yours eyes to what goes on this world and what some people might be driven to do to survive. It also shows that not all people who do bad things are really bad people.I was required to view this for a college course in urban geography (in class) Not only did it truly hold the attention of the entire class of 40 exhausted evening class students, but we talked about it for weeks afterward. I am so glad our instructor opened our eyes to this film. It even prompted me to purchase the book (which is also excellent but much more graphic, even disturbing at times).That said, however, if you are bothered by violence I do not recommend watching this movie."
4,New Favorite Movie,"First of all the movie is ALL SUBTITLES because it is in Portuguese. However, it is so amazing that you don't even realize you're reading the screen. It made me laugh, cry, and almost pee my pants is suspense! I was a little sad when I opened up the box and all I saw was a dvd. I prefer to also see a little booklet or at least a list of the chapters. I rate the movie a 5+ but a 4 for the presentation of the dvd."
4,fearful living,"Nothing was to horrible for this film, from the beginning to the end it demonstrated experiences that I will never witness with my own eyes. Having that in mind, I sat through it with an open mind, and gained respect for the culture and way of life. City of God, shows how true friendship can be the best survival tool."
5,"great movie, simply great!","one word. Great.must see, you forget in minutes that your reading sub titles, and get swallowed into the film."
4,No Redemption In The City Of God,"The film explores the violent lives of young people living on the fringe of Rio in a delapidated housing project called the City Of God. Gang life, robbery, coldbloodedness marks a world devoid of much that is positive. The film is brutally honest about a side of life often ignored in developing countries. The characters are a mix of kids with nothing better to do and kids who have been turned into hardened killers.Years ago another film Pixote explored the similar circumstances of Brazilian street kids and the characters were more sympathetic and fully realized than the characters in City Of God. Ultimately City Of God is worth viewing to peer into a subculture of violence and criminality fostered in an environment of dire poverty but it will leave you depressed since it offers no sense of hope or solution."
4,what a increditable struggle,"basis on true story well put together, the struggle to be good in a world full of bad. I lked it . what an increditable struggle"
5,One of the best gangster films ever made.,"NOt only does this movie have credibility over other gangster films because it is just as good, but all of the actors in this movie except for one are amateurs with no prior experience. That sets it above all else, and the quality of this movies is awesome (Big Budget level) though it was made on a shoestring budget."
5,One of the Best Movies I've Ever Seen,"Some say that this film glorifies gang violence but I see it otherwise. Sensitive to these issues while maintaining a slight moral stance on them, City of God tells individual stories with such flair and poeticism that I almost cried during this movie due to its eye-opening beauty. A must-have for any shelf."
3,Couldn't Finish it - too violent / too many drugs,"Well filmed, probably has potential, but my wife and I only made it about half way through it. Very violent, including shooting of children, drug use among almost all characters, kids smoking pot. Not for the light hearted."
2,God would not have cared any less,"The problem with docudramas is that these at times fail to create the dread, the fear, the disgust and the sympathy which a darker form of movie making can. In this Brazilian movie, about the eponymous Rio De Janeiro slum of the 70s, the central character, who is the narrator too, fails to evoke the pathos in the viewer, which the movie should have. In fact, at the end of the goings on, one does not feel too strongly about the violence in the movie either. It could have been a very impactful movie had the drama been made more intense and powerful. Ram Gopal Verma-ish treatment of this script would have created a wonderful movie. There were many moments in the script which could have been nail biting had its (the script) treatment been more feature film like."
3,"Brilliantly made, but brutality gets boring","City of God is a fantastically shot, composed, structured and directed film. An absolutely stunning example of the art of film-making. Beyond all that, though, is the story: occasionally gripping, sometimes amusing, but overwhelmingly and distatefully violent. About two-thirds of the way through this film I found myself totally bored by the endless killings, as youth after youth is gunned down. It loses all meaning, and I mostly started wondering whether I wasn't in some way damaging myself. Still, made me grateful that I don't live in Brazil! And I won't be going there in a hurry..."
2,Documentary is much better,"I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone - unless they were scouting for someone to direct the next James Bond or Arnold Schwarzenegger film. It's just a fast-paced gangster flick, using (one is tempted to say 'exploiting') as a background one of the most troubled slums in the world. People die every few moments, and it sports a relentless, pumped-up, John-Woo-style gun-and-trouble worship which you can find in dozens of action flicks these days. It's flashy as hell, and not real.The documentary on the DVD, however, is another story altogether. It's completely centered on the government terror that rains down on this city daily (something very marginal in the film) and is truly terrifying in a way that the andrenaline-MTV-soaked movie can't touch."
2,BRAZILIAN BOYS N THE HOOD,"it's very obvious that the makers of this movie were influenced by american movies like MENACE 2 SOCIETY and PULP FICTION.there's all kind of arty mtv music video direction, narration, flashbacks, flash forwards, violence---and a plot about a ghetto kid turned...photographer!?!also lots of disco type music, that kinda makes the movie cornball after awhile, despite all the violence."
3,jimmy cagney redux,"an overrated but frequently compelling view of gang warfare in rio. this got told by american filmmakers in the 1930s (anyone remember ""public enemy""?), but of course its not politically correct to say that."
5,The City you'll never forget,"The movie centers around a skinny, easy-going teenager nicknamed ""rocket,"" who's too afraid of guns but is able to put up with the worst crime-ridden favela (slum) in one of the World's largest cities. Rocket narrates back and forth in a journey that takes you to his experiences around the underworld of narcotics, gang shoot outs, crooked cops, partime jobs, and teen love-affairs in the sceneries of Rio de Janeiro that ""don't come up in post-cards.""Along with 'Amores Perros,' this ought to be the best masterpiece coming out of Latin America cinema in recent years."
4,Good Movie,I really like this movie. Could be considered a little violent for some but the story line is interesting and keeps your attention. I watched so intently that I forgot I was reading sub titles! Awesome that it was only $1.99 to rent!
5,amazing movie,it is one of the best foreign films i have ever seen. i highly recommend watching and/or buying this movie.
5,Awesome excellent movie!!,It's amazing how foreign films deliver such action and drama while telling semi-true stories. The cinematography and acting made this movie spellbinding.
5,Stunning.,"This movie is a stunning achievement. Without question the best film of the year. It shows that film making is still a vibrant art form, despite all the rubbish being produced in Hollywood these days."
1,Wanted to walk out,"If I had driven my own car to this movie I would have walked out. One of the most senslessly violent movies I have seen. If your idea of a good time includes watching a thug ask two small crying children (3-5 years old) if they want to be shot in the hand or the foot, and they shoot them... If you enjoy watching a thug then decide to kill one of these kids to earn his way into the gang, and he kills the child... then buy the movie, cuddle up with your popcorn enjoy."
1,Over-rated dreck,"The only difference between this movie and your average Hollywood shoot 'em up is that in this movie, they speak in a foreign language and in your average Hollywood shoot 'em up, you just might care about a character or two.This is basically gratuitous violence and complete garbage masquerading as ""art"". And the freaking ""Matrix"" shot? Please. That was played out in '99."
1,City of God aka Boys in the Hood,"The title and short of the DVD, would lead one to belive that this was film was about the homeless children of Brazil and how they survive everyday oppression. Instead it is like a Brazilian version of ""Boys in the Hood"". It is about stealing, killing very violent with no particular message. How can I get my money Back???"
1,"Horrible film: pointless, poorly produced, monotonous","From all the high reviews I decided to watch this video, and had to force myself to go through it, wondering when it was going to hit it's stride. It never did, and just proceeded to hash out more of the same type of footage as seen in the first 15 minutes. This material could have been packaged way better: develop a better story or some hook to focus the attention, get rid of the tired technique of jerky handheld camera POV (it has been played to death), and shorten the film (towards the end I just completely lost interest). The whole film was just tiresome."
1,this movie stinks,i heard so many great things about this movie. I was sorely disappointed. the whole movie is gang members shooting each other. the end.
1,"Well, the tagline is wrong...","While city of god is an entertaining flick, it is entertaining in the wrong kind of way. The movie feels to me like a pure comedy. It will make you laugh almost as much as the acclaimed masterpiece, Beauty Shop. Ugh, where do I start with whats wrong with this film? The actors are just plain terrible. Where the heck is Vince Vaughn when you need him?OK when it comes down to it if you are looking for a serious enjoyable film, this is NOT where to look. Growing up in the slums of Brazil myself, I would know first hand on how much BS is fed to you in this garbage.The Truth is out."
2,"Good movie, poor streaming","The movie was excellent, but the streaming was very choppy, with many stops. This made the watching experience much worse than Netflix."
5,Well done,The movie was amazing at tying parts of the story into other parts. It definately held my interest all the way through. The story is more of a documentary of the people in the City of God than it is about the main character.
4,Goodfellas and Moulin Rouge,"Reminiscent of many great films, City of God proves to be an excellent portrait of slum life. Beautiful and stylistic, a friend jokingly referred to the film as ""a mix between Goodfellas and Moulin Rouge."" Though it was a strange comparison, the film does have the overtones of the Scorsese masterpiece, and the dizzying and beautiful stylisms of Baz Luhrmann's groundbreaking display of MTV style editing.City of God has so many different elements, and goes through so many emotions, that I really felt that I got more than my moneys worth with this ticket. Sometimes suspenseful, sometimes sorrowful, sometimes laugh out loud funny, the film ranges everything from gangster story to dance party and back again - all without batting an eye."
2,I love latin foreign movies but this one's boring: drug dealers and shooting,There are no surprises in this movie compared to the telenovelas.It's basically a movie about drug dealing punks who take over each generation or decade.
5,One of the greatest movies...,"Some people are afraid to watch City of God anticipating a grim, explicit look at drugs, death and sex,but actually they're just delaying the pure enjoyment of good story telling, charming characters and wonderful cinematography. I felt good by the end of this movie and so will anyone else watchingit."
5,Mind Blowing,"One of the best films i've ever seen. Very disturbing at times, perhaps too much so, but Meirelles truly got his poin across with this film. Powerful and compelling. A simply amazing film."
4,Masterful Storytelling,"Great movie showing the rise and fall of characters set against the backdrop of Rio's ""City of God"" faveala. Although at times violent, there are many poignant elements and this contrast makes the story and characters more compelling."
5,City Of God Review,This Movie was AMAZING! I recommend It to everyone. Kept me on my toes and very pleased with the ending.
5,City of God,"This riveting, vibrant, hyper-kinetic crime film by the Brazilian director of ""The Constant Gardener"" details the harsh realities of daily life in the Rio slums, where gangs of youth battle for control of the illicit drug trade. Cast entirely with nonpros from the real-life City of God ghetto, the film is based on a novel by Paulo Lins, who drew on an appalling true story. Da Hora, Nachtergaele, Haagensen, and the rest of the cast are sensational--colorful, complex, and utterly credible in their respective roles. With its flashy camerawork, jagged chronology, and explosive violence, ""City of God"" is a compelling tour de force that'll hit you like a megaton bomb."
2,"Yet Another Young, British Heroine...","I've read (and enjoyed) ""The Diary Bridget Jones,"" ""Jemima J,"" ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" and countless other novels about shy, yet witty, British women trying to find their way during their late twenties and early thirties. ""Slave to Fashion"" is more biting look at the world of relationships and fashion, and the heroine, Katie Castle, is not as demure as other characters in similar novels. Despite this, I could not connect with Katie the way I could with Bridget Jones. As much as I tried to like Katie and actually care about the travesties in her life, I could not bring myself to feel sorry for her for the mistakes she makes; I felt she finally got what was coming to her.I'd be interested to read any possible further works by this author, since she has a formula that appears to be working for other authors. I would, however, not recommend this first effort by her."
1,Please read this...,"During lazy summer months, I indulge in a little light, upbeat reading about romance, shopping, friendships and life as a single gal. Most of the books in this genre are fairly well-written, entertaining, light and funny, sadly, this book IS NOT. To be blunt, it was horrible. The main character, Katie Castle, is the type of person you avoid in real life (nasty, jealous, two-faced, shallow, low in self-esteem, hateful to her friends and family...). No matter how hard the author tried, this character was never likeable and impossible to relate to (you don't want her to succeed...never a good sign). The only advice I can give is please don't waste your time reading this book...it isn't worth it.If you do want a fun, light-hearted novel, try anything by Naomi Walker or Clare Naylor's Dog Handling.Thanks."
1,Boring,I couldn't get past 40 pages and that was after skimming some! The first person mind rambling is hard to read. You know what happens to turn the plot yet it takes forever getting there. Too many boring side/back stories. There are better out there. Sophie Kinsella writes well but never should have offered a positive quote for this book!
2,Don't be a slave to this book...,"I bought this book for some light reading while on a cruise this winter. Instead, I was frustrated by the simplicity of the writing, the unlikeable and boring characters, and the mundane plot line. I put it down after 100 pages -- something I never do.This was the worst novel I've read in a long time.Save your money, or if you are looking for something fun, try The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants series."
5,I wanted to hate it but ...,"I hate chick-lit. I hate the shallow, silly girls who live in it and the shallow silly world they inhabit. So I didn't want to read this book. But a long flight and a raving girlfriend made me do it. And what an amazing surprise. Real characters, smart lines, clever ideas and a thrilling (well, if you like love stories) plot. It's just so incredibly cool. Slave to Fashion is like life, only better."
2,Eh.....,"This book was okay, at best. Out of all the chick lit books I've read so far, this had to be my least favorite one."
1,Didn't find it interesting..,"I will admit, I made it to the 3rd chapter and took it back to the library. Could not get into it at all...very slow beginning!"
2,Poor...,I bought this book thinking that it would bring me to the world of fashion with aw or ohhs... but instead I was brought to the world of a very selfish individual Katie. The author also describe everything too much. I found myself re-reading the lines to understand what she`s describing about. This book failed to capture my attention from the very first chapter. It probably worked for others but it didn`t work for me...
1,Awful. Save Your Money.,"If I could give this book 0 stars I would. It was just awful and I can not see how anyone could have enjoyed it. Thinking this was a new author I decided to give it a try. I bought this book after noticing that Sophie Kinsella, author of The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopoholic reviewed and enjoyed it. I could not believe that main character Katie Castle. She was a conceited, manipulative woman who needed to grow up. The story went no where and I'm just sorry I couldn't get my money back."
1,I couldn't even finish it!,"First off let me just say that I'm not a picky reader when it comes to chiclit books. I usually love 'em all! The Shopaholic Series, Anything Jane Green, or Nic Sparks. You name it I own it! I'm also a Fashion Student and love anything involving the catwalk & designers, so when I saw this book I just had to have it! I guess now would be a good time to mention I bought this book about 5 years ago and have tried numerous times over the years to finish it! (TRY being the keyword) When I would take the time to read it my eyes would glaze over with boredom. The book went no where, the characters are dull, and it's just plan BORING! I ended up giving this book to Goodwill. Don't waste your money! And if you do, don't say I didn't warn you!"
3,You will slave to finish this book.,"Buyer beware, this is not the typical brit chick lit novel. I found it very hard to sympathize with the main character, Katie Castle, because she's so self-centered and materialistic. Although the reader is taken on a voyage where girl (Katie) has everything, makes a stupid mistake, loses everything including boy, and then starts the path to recovering everything, I just didn't find myself careing what happened to her. Reading the book from Katie's perspective was aggravating since I didn't agree with most of her thought processes and disliked her. For readers looking for a good book with fashion and wacky 20something girl antics, I would suggest reading something lighter with a stronger, more likeable heroine. For instance any of Sophie Kinsella's 'Shopaholic' novels."
3,Not bad...not great,I was hoping this book would follow along the lines of Sophie Kinsella's style of writing...while it wasn't exactly that...it wasn't a bad novel. Katie makes you want to pity her when she falls victim to Penny Moss...who was totally a witch and then some! I struggled at certain parts but did finish in less than a week.
4,A darker and cleverer Bridget Jones!,"This novel has the essential chick lit elements -- young woman seeking love and career success in London -- but the story has a darker edge and cleverer appeal than the other Bridget Jones knock-offs!Katie fits more into the ""anti-heroine"" category. She lets us into the very shallow and sad world of the fashion industry with a great deal of irony. The heroine herself seems to find this glamorous, yet gloomy world as part of everyday life. Her life, however, is together. She has a great apartment and a fiancee, who happens to be her boss's son. A fling tumbles her perfect world apart, and she must do whatever possible to redeem herself and her reputation.With a darker approach to humor than most books of this genre, Slave to Fashion is one clever chick lit! I recommend it most highly."
2,um...,"ugh. not to sound so harsh. but her previous book kinda was boring too. it was long and draggy. i've decided to give this book a chance after seeing a comment made by Sophia Kinsell, the author of the famous Shopaholic series and found that this book seem to be a borrowed idea of shopaholic and it was really boring. not funny. anything. nadah."
1,TERRIBLE!!,I could barely finish this book! It is boring and terribly written and there is no character development!Don't waste your time.
1,AUTHOR DID NOT DO HER OWN RESEARCH!,"SHE TALKS ABOUT Siberian Ginseng, THIS IS NOT A real Ginseng! See does not even mention Shepherd's Purse as A way to stop periods, I hate it when a person like this one never actually does her own research. She mentions of mixing herbs together that should not be mixed. NO warnings for herb drug reactions. She speaks of using Black Cohosh (causes liver damage), wild yam root which does nothing, and St. John's Wort all at once. St. John's wort MUST BE TAKEN WITH CAUTION. DO NOT TAKE IT WITH DRUGS! IT can make matters worse. Newer books would be a far better choice Such as ""National Geographic DesK Reference to Nature's Medicine"" AND PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO ""HERBS DEMYSTFIED!!!"" This Woman's book Should be used to start a campfire with."
2,Cross My Heart,"This book is an easy read. Brain candy. The premise is cute, the prologue engaging. The title is catchy. You could take it to the beach or haul it around in your purse to read in bits and pieces during your commute.Sadly, though, I didn't enjoy it as much as her other novels. I wasn't attached to the characters and it seemed like this book somehow bypassed editing. There just was no driving need to turn the page and see what was going to happen next. It wasn't bad, but I'll think twice when deciding whether to buy her next book or borrow it from the library."
2,"An okay read, read well","The best thing about the audio edition of this book is reader Marie Caliendo's pacing and vocal characterizations. Ms. Caliendo takes her time rendering this predictable, riches-to-rags-to-riches story. Her vocal characterizations lent interest to otherwise one-dimensional, underdeveloped participants. The shamelessly open ending almost screams ""sequel!,"" but if Marie Caliendo is the reader, I'd consider getting it."
2,If you like emotionally stunted characters...,"then you'll like this book. I just wanted them to grow up (warning - most don't and you have to wait till last couple of pages (or minutes) until two of them do. This one doesn't have any of the wit or charm that the ""Simply"" series holds. The love scenes made me wince and every one described how the female lead ""tingled"" somewhere. I'm really regretting the $30 + dollars spent on the audio version."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing. The author is so obsessed with disproving the arguments of the anti-porn feminists (which are about 20 years old at this point) that he misses a grand opportunity to simply understand what men are doing with porn. Essentially, he has let his enemy frame the language and topic of debate and he never gives himself the opportunity to move beyond a discussion of whether or not porn equals subjugation of women.To be sure, subjugation of women is a valid topic when discussing porn, but it is far from the only topic. What about fantasies, what about masturbation, what about relationships and negotiating porn, what about shame, what about gay men, what about pleasure for god sakes? All these issue are forgotten in Loftus's intractable argument with anti-porn feminism."
4,"A unique plot. ""Sommersby"" with amnesia.","The story, as described by both reviewers, is fresh and interesting. The writer has characters that really come to life and you can relate to. Very enjoyable. ( the back cover is terrible. Who can believe a war hero looks like he's 15 yrs. old?) Chase is all man, inside and out. I didn't give it a 5 because of Linese. She starts out as a delicate bride, becomes a very strong woman and then seems to beomce a whimpering, delicate lady again. Liked her better strong. The secondary characters were larger than life."
2,The ABC challenge in financial institutions still remains!!!,"The Activity Based Costing Methodology showed in this book, by itself, doesn't provide full answers to the challenges Financial Institutions have been facing.Of course, some simple and commom questions are addressed, adapted from manufacturing knowledge, but complex ones aren't.For example, the question ""how can I compute IT costs to products, services, customers, distribution chanells?"" can be answered in a correct way.As a ""growing high tech consumer"", financial services industry needs valuable answers to these questions.Since 1994, we've performing projects related to implementation of Advanced Cost and Budget Systems using ABC Costing. Recently, we've perfomed projects in 2 global Banks (top 10, assets), where we can focus in answer in a correct way these complex questions.However, I think the book is usefull for starting discussion about the theme in the financial institutions environment.Thank you.Christiano Mendonca, Brasil"
3,The Anthony Lane segment,"'New Yorker' film critic Anthony Lane speaks with Charlie Rose about a collection of Lane's reviews and other writings,""Nobody's Perfect."" Lane speaks about his enthusiasms in film especially for works of comedy. He talks about Cary Grant as key player in the history of cinema. He speaks about Woody Allen now esentially doing nothing more than creating works which he has done before. He speaks about his debt to the film critic Pauline Kael. All of this is done in a slightly understated British way. It nonetheless did not come out as very convincing or interesting.One of the great skills of Charlie Rose is in his selection of guests. He is a person of quality who often gets the best from all areas in question.While Lane does say interesting and sensible things in certain places- I am not sure that Charlie Rose with this one has done what he usually does in guest- selection."
5,the theed generator complex is a great toy and does a lot,.It has two exploding panels!The generator includes 1 battle droid the front front ramp folds up two battle stands and exploding platforms.The theeed generator does not have printed panels but it does have stickers.
3,"Fantastic book for Flash MX, Actionscript Experts ONLY","I agree with the others that this is the most advanced flash game book without exception. The book is over 620+ pages with very little fluff and no novice turorials or hand holding.If you have a firm grasp of Flash MX, Actionscripting and using Flash MX as a game platform you cannot do wrong with this book.However if you are a beginner you will not find the typical basic tutorial sections that expert users loath as a waste of print. If you have not used Flash MX extensivly I reccomend purchasing one of the other titles that do the hand holding to get yourself up to speed before you invest in Flash MX Game Design Demystified.Good book for the expert user, but not good at all for the beginner."
4,Excellent! Good examples and lots of code.,"The layout of the book was very good, each section really seemed to blend into the next, building on the previous.While I'm very familiar with Flash AS, I was happy to see the sections on trig, physics and collision detection! My maths are pretty rusty and these are areas that I always struggle with. Actually having *working code* to look at is invaluable.The multi-user section was quite interesting too, with both basic chat and game examples. All the examples use ElectroServer as the backend, so there are some specifics which relate to that server only. However the ideas presented are applicable to any multi-user based game, regardless of the backend server.Anyone looking for some insights to coding a game in flash MX would not go wrong in reading this book."
5,An all in one FLASH GAME DEVELOPMENT source,"Well first off, im a pretty advanced user of Flash MX. However, there are many tough subjects that this book covers well. From front to back, I learned something new every chapter. New ideas of coding things and better practices. As long as you have used expert mode ActionScript in Flash, you should be fine with this advanced book. It really has all you need to know!"
1,doesn't look or sound like the original record,This CD version of Little Monsters sucks big time. The packaging sucks and the sonic quality is that of an amatuer. I own the original record. It is awesome. This shlock label took a rock classic and turned it into a piece of junk. Every song on this disc is great but you would never know it given that this is one of the worst sounding CDs I have ever heard. EVER. Does Wounded Bird records know how to spell digital distortion let alone hear it? I don't think so. The original record is so great. What were they thinking? Members of the band Holland consider this an unautorized release and want nothing to do with it. It is a disgrace to this great classic rock band. And a PINK CD! Wounded Bird Records should be sued and shut down.
1,Full of static and hiss,This sounds as though Wounded Bird dubbed this straight from the LP rather than the Master tape. You can even hear cracks and pops throught this CD. Very lousy and cheasy job on behalf of Wounded Bird Records.
5,Smile,"Being a 2yr Highschool Student of Kaya's, I may be a little biased. If asked to describe Church Of The Dog I would use the analagy of Being a fly on the wall while, Sitting Bull, Quintin Terrantino, Bob Dylan, And Henry Rollins shared a morning cup of coffee. Her writing style is very unique as is she. And her phillosophies on life and its anonimities Never ceases to shine a new light on a subject. No matter How many times I've thought about the same thing. Great Job Kaya, I'll be looking forward to reading some more books in the near future."
2,Bubble Bath Fantasy,"In the interview with the author at the end of the book, she relates that when she began writing The Church of the Dog, she did not intend to have it published. It is a well intentioned book, but it reads like an extended journal of a middle school student who is exploring the genre of supernatural fantasy. The main character, with her sugary-super-special-magical-powers, is just a bit too precious for my taste."
5,Great Fun!,My 2 yearold son loves this heavy duty rig. It takes all of his crashes without a scratch. The two motorcycles are loads of fun!
4,Excellent jacket except for one glaring omission.,"I really like this jacket. It is well designed and completely waterproof. There are flaps and velcro strips everywhere. However, there are only 2 pockets in the entire jacket! A third pocket is definitely needed for an iPod, cell phone, etc. I looked and looked behind all those flaps, but no third pocket! I deducted one star for this missing third pocket.The care instructions make for interesting reading:1. Wash with cold water.2. DO NOT USE FABRIC SOFTNER.3. DO NOT TUMBLE DRY.4. DO NOT IRON.5. DO NOT DRY CLEAN.I was standing in front of the washing machine scratching my head - OK, so what can I do?The jacket was made in VietNam."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,When I was writing my dissertation on Jackson and another author I found this book absolutely indispensible. I was completely inspired by Hall's work; the book gave me strength to finish my own study. Thank YOU!!
1,wack!!!,"I Like the Cats in the Film&the Ladies in the Film was solid for my eyes but as far as watching this Film that couldn't make up it's mind if it wanted to be""How to be a Player"" or ""Daddy Day care""? Forgetaboutit.save your money.it has a few aight scenes here&there but on a whole it's a lemon.the best part for me was the kid playing little 2Pac in the mini Low-rider."
1,Watch the trailer--it's better than the movie,"Someone owes me three bucks for renting this movie, excuse me, waste of time and money. I'll give it to you, the trailer made me think I was going to be actually watching a comedy. And Anthony Anderson is usually a bright spot in any film. Poor Anthony couldn't save this dog. I was dismayed when my husband and I rented this movie and discovered that the best and only jokes of the film were shown on the trailers. They were also shown fairly early in the film too. So we basically sat watching the movie in dead silence. I began daydreaming to entertain myself until my husband begged me to turn it off. Yep, it was that bad. We can only stand about 45-50 minutes of crap at at a time. Please save your money and buy food or gas or a better movie. If I've saved just one person money from staying away from this movie, than I feel I've done my good deed for the day."
2,Passed Time,"I had nothing to do and it was raining. I knew Anthony Anderson and Eddie Griffin are pretty funny, so why not. The movie was cute and it did have it's funny moments. Don't buy it, but it will make you chuckle."
3,Funny movie!,This film had a few laughs. If you like any of the lead actors you should watch this movie.When I saw the outtakes I could tell that they had planned to make this film a lot moreraunchy but they decided not to go with an R rating. Recommended for fans of AnthonyAnderson.
2,Nothing Special,"If you were expecting a Daddy Day Care sort of movie well you'll be disappointed. Just the title alone I wasn't really expecting this movie to be on a Friday or Barbershop 1 type level but I was expecting it to be a little more funny than it was. It had some cute moments and if not for Method Man playing the crazy cousin ""No Good"", John Amos (Good Times) playing his typical hilarious father figure role, and Paula Jai Parker (The original Friday) playing her usual ghetto fabulous roles, it probably would have easily have gotten 0 stars. However, the fact that the movie was actually clean, and the comedy very tame to the point where I could let my 9 year old watch it, I won't complain too bad. The fact that the message of the movie was to show grown men to take better care of their responsibility as parents was not lost on me as well which saved me from completely trashing the movie."
4,To Tame A Land,"This book had one of the best plots of any Louis L'Amour books you'll ever read. Louis L'Amour does a graet job of getting the readers attention and keeping it throughout the book. The author discribes the setting so well, it feels like you are there. My only dislike of this book would be that the author skips around from subject to subject, but it did make the story make sence. I think anyone with a sense of adventure or anyone that likes western books would like this book."
5,Great book on CD,"Great story by Louis LaMour, and it is well presented on this CD. IF you like LaMour, you will love this book on CD."
4,One of man y,I am a fan of Louis L'Amour books. L'Amour has a way of writing visually making the reader feel like he can see what is taking place.
1,how low can you go,"I have never heard such a boring,monotone style. This music is absolutely depressing.Music is supposed to make you feel good, not down.This is ""art"" music, not real music. This could be one of the worst choices I have made in contempopary music."
2,Disappointed,I became a big fan of Carrie from her previous work with Chip Taylor so I had high expectations for this solo release. A huge disappointment for me. It wasn't what I expected and I didn't care for the songwriting or the arranging.RS from NYC
4,review,"stellar, excellent CD? no- but still, its decent music. There's a lot of improvement from his previous CD's. I find it kind of stupid to keep comparing him to his brother because you can't really get your older bro to help you when you're actually singing can you? Wow, some people are really cynical. Yea, there's a lot of bubblegum pop out there but I feel his music isn't precisely teenybopper stuff. I know people will automatically judge my review as stupid and childish once they find out that I'm the same age as Aaron. But hey, I have every right to state my opinion and have it respected."
5,The BEST Cd Ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love Another Earthquake!! All the songs rock, he has pop, r n b, rap, and rock! I can't stop listenin' to it! Buy it if you havent already have...NOW!"
2,what a shame,i'm sorry to say that i loved all of his other albums but unfortuanatlly his voice has broken which i feel has ruined everything sorry arron very low rating
2,Another Earthquake In My Brain!,Once again Aaron has decided to ruin peoples ear drums listening to him trying to rap which he is horrible at. I think Aaron has potential & talent if he didn't blow it by wastng his time trying to rap!This cd has several annoying tracks of Aaron trying to rap & some tracks he actually sings! I like it when Aaron sings then he isn't so bad he sounds just like his Brother Nick Carter of the Backstreet Boys but when Aaron raps it is something wicked! This cd stinks!I recommend to you instead of Another Earthquake Nick Carter Now Or Never or Hilary Duff Metamorphosis Aaron stop making an earthquake in my brain!
5,awesome,Aaron's cd's just keep getting better all the time. I really enjoyed this one just as much as Oh Aaron.
1,Sell out,Another Album from another wannabe. Hes like an annoying little brother he always wants to be like his bigger brother. Hes about as talented as a fish with half a brain. This isn't music this is a little boy trying to be like his big brother. Did He suceed...........NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just so u know i would have put 0 stars if i could have
5,AARON ROCKS!!,"Okay, he is sooooooooooooo cool... This is by far his best album, because his voice has matured sooo much. He is so fun to sing to!! And dance to...Here is my review of each song:1. Another Earthquake- Dislike...(1/5)2. To All Of The Girls- Following in BSB's footsteps are you Aaron? Cooliez!!(6/5)3. Summertime- Skip it...hate it..(2/5)4. My First Ride- Great rap song!!(4/5)5. Do You Remember?- So georgeous...I love this (6/5)6. 2 Good 2 Be True- Cooliez tune!!(5/5)7. When It Comes To You- Great song, as pretty as ""Do You Remember""!!(6/5)8. America A O- Great song...very cool (5/5)9. Without You Me (There'd Be No Me)- Great song. Second ""dedication""!!(4/5)10. Keep Believing- Great, Great song!!POWERFUL lyrics. (6/5)11. Sugar- Hate this...it's the lyrics!!:((1/5)12. NoN Preview- A preview of ""Now Or Never"" by NC. They play 1min bits of: ""Help Me"", ""Do I Have To Cry For You"" and ""I Stand For You"". Cooliez!He does not sound like NC!"
1,HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!,"W-what is this crap?!i can't stop laughing at this loser! i'm just here to make a statement about HIM, not this cd. as unpopular as ashlee simpson(who everyone's forgotten about except all the retards on mtv)uuugh, just some little f(I never told you what I do for a living)r singing about a bunch of s(I never told you what I do for a living)t,sheeese,without artists like nine inch nails,my chemical romance,And green day, the new age of music would really f(I never told you what I do for a living)g suck! look i don't care if you give this a bad review i just hope i gave you a lot of s(I never told you what I do for a living)t to think about."
1,More [stuff]!!!,"Don't you wish we had never heard of the Backstreet Boys? Then this CD would not exist. This is another example of recycled pop that is a waste of money. Aaron is trying to be what he is not. On the outside, he acts like he is a hardcore rappper, but then he sings about stuff for little kids. Hopefully some people can see right through this."
5,OK Lets Be Honest Folks,"OK....I have to say that as an award winning producer/singer-songwritter, that this is probably THE worst CD that my critically acclaimed ears have ever heard. What I would like to do is get with Mr. Carter, one on one, and really give him a fundamental lesson on pitch and tone. You see these are the foundation blocks for teaching someone how to SING, and sing he does not!! His terribly thin and misguided vocals do little distract you from the marginal arrangement and production, which only adds to this collision of awful singing and cliche pop culture references that we call Aaron Carter's ""Another Earthquake"" CD."
1,This MUST be a joke,"Aaron Carter is yet another poor excuse for music today! ...This music is so lame it is hilarious.The only reason Aaron Carter got a contract is because his brother is a Backstreet Boy(which isn't saying much.hehe)This album is good for one thing though,I mean my dog does need a new frisbee..."
1,good,"holy ...! I love this album.seriously, this cd really works for me! every time I set my drink on the coffee table, I never leave a ring! a simply fantastic coaster!! ummm.. would i listen to it? NONONON NO. but aaron carter, my fine furniture thanks you"
1,Another Disaster,"Well, the little chipmunk's all grown up now. The pretty boy is still selling CD's thanks to the brainless preteen children of America. As long as the kids are stupid, he'll keep on makin' his lame @55 music. The apocalypse can't come soon enough..."
1,THIS CD [stinks] BUT I WILL GIVE HIM A STAR CUZ I FEEL BAD!,"... AARON CARTERS NEW CD [stinks]! when i heard his new cd ""another earthquake"" i was like what the heck! his voice [stinks] and his songs [stink]2if you want real pop music get b2k or dreamstreet or mario"
5,Fan-fudgepackin-tastic,"I think this cd is super. Too many of these reviews are quick to point out Aaron's obvious lack of talent but I think as a whole that they've just missed the point on what this cd is really about, Gay Liberation.I think it's refreshing to see a young man so confident with his sexuality. He's out there mixing up with boys every night and in the studio every day creating the anthems for the Gay Movement.Right on, Aaron, keep on man pumpin!"
2,Another Earthquake To My Ears!,Aaron has yet again decided to annoy tons of people especially me by trying to rap! Aaron Has Some Talent When he uses it by singing!Aaron Stop You Are Causing an earthquake through my ears & into my brain!I also Recommend Nick Carter Now Or Never Instead Of Another Earthquake!
1,NO WAY!!!!!!,"This is one of Joseph's daughters (the youngest one)Aaaron Carter needs to realize that he can't sing at all. He is an idol to ""boy crazy"" girls. No offense, but those are probably the only people that like him besides his brother, the heavily talented Nick Carter. Nick gives him a chance and some motivation to do great but what does Aaron do? He takes Nick's motivation, stomps on it, chews it up and makes songs like ""2 good 2 be true"" and ""another earthquake.""I feel sorry for Nick's reputation now"
1,ugh,"Will someone please shoot this kid? This guy sucks, always has and always will. If this is what pop music has come to, I'm ashamed to share the same Earth as him and his followers. Worthless garbage."
3,Average by my standards,"Nice Lyrics, voices are average. I've heard church recordings of them and it seems as if something is holding them back. Some of the previously mentioned songs are listenable but aren't anything special. It's got a nice mellow sound, so I could dig this album for background music at a laid back party.Someone is actually my favorite track. Seems like someone put some time in to putting that melody together.Someone's probably the only song I'll archive."
3,Not bad...Kinda good,"Not bad, not bad at all. Ladies can sing, got powerful voices with some good R&B songs on this cd. Most of the song I never heard before, but overall good quality was put forth into the making of this cd."
2,Alright,"The album isnt really all that good, but ""Right here with me"" is a very good track that should have been the 3rd single release. I think that would have helped out the album sales."
2,Ice Cream,"The Johnson Sisters have light airy vocal skills that work on a few tracks however the annoying shout-outs by R. Kelly weren't necessary. Two of the tracks Kelly wrote for the ladies are strong and make excellent use of their voices but there really aren't enough strong tracks to recommend anyone buying this entire cd.Frankly the only tracks that stood out to me are: LOVE ANGEL, ICE CREAM & STAY RIGHT HERE & RIGHT HERE WITH ME."
1,trechique21,"I have listened to all the tracks that I can stand from JS. Unfortunately, R Kelly has produced a one-hit wonder. The only goog song on the album is Love Angel and the on reason is they don't have to try to sing. If making a raunchy video is the only way to earn fans, thats pathetic. R Kelly is the greatest but I hope he didn't put too much time and energy into these girls. Hopefully the media won't give them a false nickname like the one given to Ashanti. Best of luck to JS but snging lead is not there forte."
5,GENIUS,"ANYTHING R KELLY TOUCHES IS GENIUS, AND THESE LADIES ALREADY HAVE SKILL OF THEIR OWN....COMBINE THE TWO TALENTS AND THIS CD WILL GO TO THE TOP...."
3,"""Ice Cream"" Great, but the ""Jhonson-Sisters"" (JS) NO!!!","When I heard that the Jhonson-Sisters where comming out with their debut album ""Ice Cream"" I was really excited, but when i purchased it, I expected more...The only good songs are ""Love Angel"", ""Half"", ""Ice Cream"", ""Ice Cream (remix)"", ""Handle Your Biz. (feat.Ronald Isley)"", and ""Baby, Come On"" belive me, I know music...thus isn't music, I really truly think 3LW or IYSSIS can sing not these girls. It is not woth buying. Ice Cream is great. The Jhonson-Sisters (JS)..uhhh...NO!!! What DOES happen when you bring the back to the front!!!"
1,Awsome Love Ballets,"The music production of the album itself for me is only about a 3 or 4 but the lyrical content(which most people ignore) is of the hook.its co-produced by R. Kelly and he usually does good stuff. Although the girls are young, its not a corny,crapy, pop ablum you would usually get with Britiny Spears. It has a very universal appeal and its not dirty or anything. Check it out!!"
2,Ice Cream,"I thought the song was okay I just didn't get the meaning of the song. All they were talking about was Ice Cream, what does that have to do with anything!"
3,This Is Definitely Produced By R. Kelly,"The ladies of JS have nice, serene voices, but everything on the cd sounds the exact same for some unknown reason. I'm not saying it isn't good to listen to. You can just about tell what the content of the songs are and how the beats are.The best songs are Stay Right Here, Love Angel, and the title track, Ice Cream. I don't like the remix because of R. Kelly constantly yelling in the background. Plus it is poorly placed in the middle of the album four songs after the original.Maybe on their next attempt, the sisters will be able to come up with something a little bit better."
3,changin faces 2003,js is'nt as groundbreaking as mr. big claimed they was gonna be kelly could have written ice cream for changin faces back in 94 or sparkle or anybody hell I'm waiting for the remix with trina.best thing js has goimng for them is the looks and cd's lilke this makes me miss real singers like chaka khan.
3,I remember getting this album for my aunt...,"From what I recall there are a couple of cute cuts. ""Ice Cream"" surprisingly was one of the best songs on the album. The remix was good too (just not that different from the original). R. Kelly had his imprint all over these songs (he wrote most/all of them) and while he's talented, this record doesn't fully show his skills. Like I said, some alright songs but a lot of filler. I remember my aunt liked some of the songs a lot but as a whole I don't think either one of us was impressed. I wouldn't buy the album again like I did in the past but I wouldn't mind hearing this again just to see how it compares now.3 stars."
3,And another thing...,"Since we're talking about ice cream, JS is the flava of the month. Whether or not they'll be around next year, we'll have to wait and see."
4,"This ""Ice Cream"" Tastes DELICIOUS!","JS are not only backed by the legendary Ronald Isley but also the legendary R.Kelly! ""Ice Cream"" and ""Half"" are wonderful songs! JS are on the right path to success! I recommend this wonderful CD set to any Isley Bros. or R.Kelly fan!"
1,NOT FOR T60 although Amazon bundles this armband with the T60,"Amazon often offers linked deals, buy one item and another shows up as recommended. I ordered a T60 and saw the armband offered with it .. I foolishly didn't read that it was an armband for the T10. It really doesn't fit the T60 ... I hope Amazon debundles the two items."
3,Depends on what you're doing while wearing it.,"this arm band is ok. My personal preference is to use the Spring loaded clip on the MP3 player to clip to my pants or shorts rather than use this huge armband holder around my arm (that's moving) while it gradually slides down my arm.The holder fits the MP3 player PERFECTLY, but its ease of use is subpar since its up near your shoulder. Its cheap, so buy it, if you don't like it, then your out like 10 bucks."
4,First Alert Gun Safe,"Received my First Alert 6741DF safe today. Overall very pleased with the purchase for the price of $580 and free shipping. Very solid, it was delivered on time, and had no marks or dings. Very heavy weighing in almost 400 lbs, which was the determining factor of this over Sentry Safes. Its like a mini tank. Would give 5 stars if it had a place to put a cord through for a dehumidifier rod. Might be able to fit one through the holes used bolt it to the wall, but havent tried yet. Electronic combo was easy to program without any problems."
4,a secret surprise,i bought this cd because of a lesser work by a fairly obsucre composer named charles koechlin.the engineering of this disc is pristine and the other pieces are as well represented as the jewel of a chamber work by koechlin.the pieces selected to round out the disc are beautifully peformed and serve as elegant examples of the very best of early 20th century chamber music.
3,dead dudes,i got this for dead dudes the other movie are bad real bad i like dead dudes in tha house
3,Two out of three ain't bad...,"""Dead Dudes in the House"" (also known as ""House on Tombstone Hill"") is a pretty good slasher/zombie flick if you appreciate movies with a so bad they're good quality about them. It's easily the best of the three films in this set.""The Newlydeads"" isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly not a horror gem or anything.Lastly, ""Zombie Bingo"" (or whatever it's called) was horrible! It looks like the movie was made by a group of friends using their camcorder then dubbing silly voices over their footage. I've never seen any movie this stupid before. This movie is complete rubbish and should be avoided at all costs.If you like Troma-style movies, this set isn't the worst collection you could buy. If you prefer to watch movies with decent budgets and actors, look elsewhere."
5,Space Zombie Bingo,"Space Zombie Bingo was shot on 16mm motion picture film, not on a camcorder. People/reviewers who have never made a film and probably never will, may not know there is a difference."
3,"The book is about the victims, not the killer","Be prepared to read about nearly every tragedy that can befall a young person. Most of those women were pretty much doomed from birth, only because they had the misfortune to pick the wrong people for parents.......and the wrong man's truck to climb into 15 or 20 years later.His death toll is actually at least 55, not 53, because two of the victims were known to have been pregnant, one nearly at term, at the time of their deaths. Saddest of all were the numerous children left orphaned by this monster disguised as a slow-witted truck painter.If you're looking for Gary Ridgway's story, this isn't it."
3,Digressions ... YUCK!,"All of Ann's books (I've read this and two others) are well written and obviously well researched through numerous interviews. Thereby lies the problem: The books never seem to ""pick up."" They contain endless digressions into the past while they pick apart every minor detail of every life. At times I expect to read about the childhood of a victim's milkman.These endless digressions retard the story's progress. I found myself lost after one such instance."
3,Too long,"Too much attention to law's personal activities, etc. Details about who/what/etc that investigated - overdosed me on their lives and made me lose track of the victims and the mass murderer."
4,Solved Through Years of Dedication,"Ann Rule, the Queen of true crime writing, strikes another note of dedicated research and brilliance. Makes you feel the pain of his victims and their families. So deceptively brutal, yet living and working every day amongst us. Makes you wonder about that co-worker next to you, or the neighbor on the other side of the fence. Makes one appreciate those thankless individuals in law enforcement, who truly are trying to protect us from the evils of our fellow man. Be aware of your surroundings people."
2,Not a page-turner,"I kept waiting for the book to get better. I understand why Ann spent so much time with the details of each murder, she was trying to paint a picture of the victims and honor them. However, her descriptions were much too technical and did not do justice to the many who suffered. I would not recommend this book."
3,"Long setup, adequate writing and overall enjoyable read.","With the number of victims, the setup for the story involves a lot of bio information and takes a considerable amount of time. It's worth it though, as knowing the bios pays off.This was my first Ann Rule book and I'd have to say I'm not disappointed with her writing skills ... but at the same time, I'm not really impressed. It seems popular, so if you enjoyed her previous work I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
1,What a disappointment,"I hesitated buying this book - the cutsie oh-so-clever title was offputting - but I took a chance and bought it, and big mistake. I found this to be way too long, offered no insight whatsoever, and sometimes it just plain rambled. I couldn't finish it."
4,Not really her style,"In this book Ann told more about the victims then the killer. I feel that because the number of girls killed was so high it was impossible to tell their individual stories in one book. This was a new writing approach for Ann, and she does deserve merit for her efforts. I read this and found myself skipping through pages as I never really connected with either the killer nor the victims. Too many unfortunate victims muddled together causing this story to not be clearly defined."
1,Drat,"Boring and artless. I truly expected more from this book. It's basically a listing of people, and of driving directions.I've read one other of her books, it was boring too."
2,didn't like this one,"I think Rules ""The Stranger Beside Me"" is one of the all time great true crime books. Her insight into Bundy and her personal relationship with him were fascinating. Here, however, her relationship to Ridgeway is not interesting in the least. She didn't know the guy - he lived nearby (no surprise) and attended some of her speaking/book signings. No surprise there either. Thats about it. The descriptions of the victims were very confusing - I couldn't keep them straight in the lease since there were so many and she hoped from one to another. Although this evil man was murdering for so many years and so many women - this book could/should have been much shorter. There are better books - wish I hadn't bothered."
4,Trip down memory lane,"I lived in South King County in Washington state when the first victims were found dead in the Green River. I remember the fear, disbelief, horror felt by people in the area that such a terrible thing could be going on in this peaceful, beautiful area.As time passed and more and more girls were reported missing and remains were found it effected all the citizens of the area. We all looked with suspicion at old boyfriends and husbands and new men we met. Could he be the Green River Killer?6 years ago I moved from that area to SW Washington near Portland, Oregon and reading this book was like looking at a chapter of my own life. Ann Rule's descriptions of the area where the bodies were found brought back memories of driving on those roads or walking along the river near those spots."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book, having read previous works by Ann Rule, including I-5 Killer and Stranger Beside Me. The sheer number of murders attributed to the GRK, together with his ability to elude police for years before he was finally caught, made his story one that intrigued me greatly. This book, though, leaves much to be desired. Most of the book is devoted to how each victim lived her life prior to dying at the hands of the killer. Very little of the book is given to fleshing out the life of the GRK, or getting into his mind as he sets out to kill. The book picks up a little at the end as the GRK is interrogated and begins to tell his story to the police. However, it is too little, too late, for by the last few pages, I felt mercifully glad to be finished, so that I could go on to another, different book."
2,mostly about the victims,"Should be called ""the real story of the lives of the victims of the Green River Killer"". Ann Rule is doing a public service by making us see the killer's victims, many of whom were prostitutes, in a more sympathetic light. But public service isn't necessarily fun or interesting and the victims' lives tend to blur together. The book does not do a good job of conveying the drama of a police investigation nor the texture of the killer's life. Not adequate for airplane reading."
2,Long and drawn out,This book is more of a yearbook of the victims than it is an account of the crimes or the mind of the GRK. It just went on and on about each girl and her miserable life and how that led her into the world of prostitution and eventually to becoming a GRK victim. I read about 3/4 of the book and then just gave up. It just went on and on and on and jumped all over the place. Only Ann Rule book I did not enjoy. And the first book I have ever not bothered to finish reading.
3,NOT HER BEST WORK!,"I Love Ann Rule's Work But this one just didnt get it for me! I appreciate that she gave the victims a Chapter each,But this book lacks something.After all of this time waiting for the GRK to be caught I thought we would hear more about how He operated,Instead its filled with endless banter about the policemen who worked the case..and Yet more talk about Ted Bundy!(We know you knew him Ann Enough Already!!)The book was OK..I think We TC readers just hold Ms Rule up to very High Standards.And Ridgeway wasnt nothing to write home about!"
2,Green River Running Red,"Ann Rule continually repeats facts over and over. Goes through failed police attempts too many times which really drags the story out more than necessary. Its like Ann is constantly trying to refresh our memory of how long it took to solve the case. Although I finished the book it got boring half way throughGreen River, Running Red: The Real Story of the Green River Killer--America's Deadliest Serial Murderer."
3,Green River Serial Killer,"Accurately and graphically covering details of horrific murders, Ann Rule does so with compassion and sympathy. This is not any easy task considering the horror of the crimes against more than 50 young women in the Pacific Northwest during the 1980's. Rule gives the reader insight into the both the killer's and the victim's motivations and life's story. This story is well-presented and conclusive. Recommended."
2,Too much info on the wrong topic,"I'm a big Ann Rule fan and this was not one of her best books. For her there was alot of research involved to be able to give such details about the victums. However, as a reader its too much to try to remember and put together. The lives of 48 different woman, it becomes a blurr and is boaring to read. The last part about them catching the killer after 20 years is ok, but still not that great for Ann. More focus s/be on Gary."
5,"A profoundly sad, disturbing and well-written account","Ann Rule's book on the Green River killings is an amazing account of one of the worst murder sprees in the history of the U.S. Rule paints compassionate portraaits of the killer's victims, most (but not all) of whom were prostitutes, and assesses the tragedy from all crucial perspectives involved, including the detectives' and killer's as well. What a sad and pathetic man he turns out to be when we finally discover his true identity and hear his morbid insights into his perverted nature. One can only mourn the lives of the girls this remorseless monster choose to pluck from the night, and Ann Rule sends them a poignant note of justice that will hopefully provide them with a greater sense of peace beyond the grave."
2,Not one of her better books,I did not think this book was well written. I skipped about 100 pages or more in the middle just to get to the end... even then I was skipping paragraphs.
5,Loved this book,"This is another great Ann Rule book. From the first chapter, I found myself unable to put it down. She does a tremendous job of making the reader care about the victims. And it's creepy that this psycho was showing up at her booksignings, etc. How awful. I applaud Ms. Rule's courage. And I can't wait for her next book."
3,She might be from this area But she doesnt know much about it or its people!!,The book was very informative but many times boring she also wrote like (or gave the impression of) she was part of the GR task force which she was not she talks about how ridgway acted and dressed just like everybody else in the area (Ridgeway was hardcore white trash)Not he did not He had no friends.I personally think she jumped the gun and quickly wrote this book with out doing all that much research.Just to be one of the first books out after Ridgway was caught!!!
1,Beating a dead horse,"I should know better but my wife is a fan of Ann Rules, so we got the book. It can be summed up in one word Boreing.Ann Rule spends too much time with extranous characters. She tells the victims life story, his or her signifivant other's life story and with over 50 victoms of the GRK she could and did expand page after page on material is not really relevent to why they were killed. After all GRK did not know his victims in that detailed level. So she is just filling pages.She is a good craftsman however and deserves brtter."
5,Ann Rule at her best,"Ann Rule has written the definitive book on the Green River killings. It is a comprehensive look at a series of murders that spanned decades and baffled detectives in Washington state. Her intimate knowledge of the area where these killings principally took place has translated into a well written book that rightly focuses on the victims of this brutal killer. Instead of glorifying the horrific details of Ridgeway's murders, she draws us into the victims lives. This is one of Ann's best books and ranks up there with ""The Stranger Beside Me"". Ann truly does Rule!"
2,not the best book on the subject,"although this book is fairly comprehensive, it comes off as quite self-serving at times. rule never passes up an opportunity to make herself seem like an insider in the case, or to point out what a caring, sensitive, thoughtful person she is in the midst of so much tragedy and horror.if you're really interested in the story of the green river killer, i'd recommend starting with smith & guillen's ""the search for the green river killer"" for a detailed account of what happened, followed by mark prothero's (with carlton smith) ""defending gary"" for further insight into the killer's mind and crimes."
2,Not one of her best,"I have read all of Ann Rule's books and this is just too disjointed. By the very nature of the crime, no. of victims, no. of years, and the changing of the many investigators, the common thread of character development that interweaves throughout the victims and investigation in most of her books, was not there. I was really disappointed."
5,This is a book that needs to be a part of your library!,"Oustanding, this book deals with many issues men face today. It shows men how to become better Husbands, Fathers, and Sons. It tells how to develop masculine relationships with other men, and how to learn from a mentor, or be a mentor. If you are seeking to better yourself, or you have become tired of the way you are and want to know how to become a ""new man"", this book is for you. Don't pass this one up, you will be hearing alot about this book from others."
5,Good buy,"I asked my partner to compare all the pregnancy books that I found in Kinokuniya bookstore. I am glad he choose this book, since it covers from pregnancy till 36 months. I did compare it with Dr Miriam Stoppard's books, and find this book is way much better for its illustration and explanation. It give step by step guidance through pregnancy that you want to know and even the basic knowledge such as breast feeding babies and changing nappies (with illustrations, of course!)"
5,GREAT BOOK,"SENT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY BROTHER AND HIS WIFE WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED THEIR PREGNANCY. THE BOOK WAS GREATLY APPRECIATED AS THEY WERE FIRST TIME PARENTS. FROM WHAT THEY TELL ME, IT HAS ALL THE HELPFUL INFORMATION AND REALLY USEFUL. GREAT BUY."
5,The best pregnancy & baby book,clear & full of illustrations..good book for new parents..give clear explanation from the beginning the the pregnancy until the first 5 years of the baby
5,Excellent Book!!!!!,This is the only book I used throughout my entire pregnancy. It has great information and illustrations. I am now the mother of a 1 month old and I still use the book. I highly recommend this book to those mothers who crave knowledge like I do. This book answered a lot of my questions from the first trimester to delivery and to caring for my baby when I bought him home. This is a must have for mothers-to-be!!!
1,I didn't like it.,I thought my child was going to love this dvd because she loves to watches in Baby First TV but when the made the dvd the play the same music constantly and gets to be annoying.I would not recommend it as a dvd.
2,Reading Scottish,"The story was adequate, but the writing of Kel speaking Scottish was so distracting that it took a lot away from the book. I found myself having to talk the dialogue out loud to figure out what Kel was saying. I never did figure out what ""ken"" was supposed to mean. If Sean Connery had been available to read it to me I would have enjoyed it more."
1,Didn't last 5 minutes :(,"I had such high hopes for this ball given all the great reviews... but unfortunately our boy destroyed the ""indestructible"" leaving nothing but a trail of little rubber pieces. Obviously I took it away once I found him at the end of the rubber rainbow, but like I said, it was less than 5 minutes.Guess we're back to the black extreme kong ball (he gets through this too, but somehow the ball stays together), his big Nylabone (eventually these need to be tossed) and his ever favorite solid, dense plastic 14"" Jolly ball (aka horse toy) - though this is NOT a house toy.Happy to hear this worked for some... but if you've truly got an aggressive chewer, this is not the toy for your dog."
5,Dog's all time favorite toy!,"My GSD aboslutely loves these things! I purchased the first one about a year and a half ago and after daily outdoor use, it still looks almost new. This ball gets thrown dozens of times a day, bounced off good NH granite boulders, tossed in rivers, chewed daily and is almost indestructible! I keep additional ones in the house now so that when he loses one (or more) in the snow during the winter, he won't get depressed. This is a heavy item so I wouldn't recommend it for indoor use. I gave a couple to friends (one has a GSD and one has a lab) and it quickly became their dogs favorite toy as well.Update: Aug 2012. Just wanted to add that I still have the original ball that was purchased in 2010 and despite the dog playing with it daily, it still looks almost brand new! Talk about an indestructable dog toy!"
4,Good product!,"Very quick shipping, good price. what more can you ask for? The ball was a little larger than i expected though. I have a doberman, shepherd mix, about 80lb dog, and the ball is a little too big for even her mouth, but the product is good. heavier than i thought too. was looking for a replacement for the tennis balls i go through, and it's about the size of a small softball, not a large tennis ball. so, i'll have to buy a smaller one to make it work. the ball is very bouncy and heavy. good toy for a much bigger dog like a mastif, or something like that!"
3,ok ball,"we have a 80lb lab, pops a tennis ball in 30 sec, this has only been used for play sesions, it does show the teeth marks, but is not coming apart. it does float, but not very high in the water, floats just so the top edge is at the surface. Our dog has a hard time finding it if he doesn't see the splash, which can lead to me having to wade out to get it:( but we have had it over 6 months and its still in one piece."
1,In the name of dysgenics,"Biased book on Eugenics. A book 1,000 times larger could be written called ""In the name of dysgenics"" and it would list civilizations destroyed, crimes, poverty & etc. Its NATURE & Nurture folks! Start thinking both sides of the equation just like we do with every other non-human species when we improve the stock. Awful things happened during the beginning of a complicated science?!! Duh! Same thing can be said for the field of Medicine.Taboos breed ignorance!"
4,Taping dog ears,"Tried all sorts of tapes for such a task.A wiggling puppy of 37 lbs task of taping ears is daunting.This product is superior and does stick & remove as appropriate.I plan to pass info regarding this product forward, now."
1,Adobe GoLive CS Classroom in a Book,"Just call me 'Lost on lesson one.' Series came recommended but as I am new to the product and web pages I don't know what to do to work around the errors. Wish I could bill them for my wasted time. Page 18 promises when you drag an icon 'a black bar to show appear indicating a family relationship to the new page.' It doesn't happen, and other similar items don't link. Rip off but once you open the CD you are stuck with it."
1,Hard to believe something this bad was released,The absolute and complete arrogance of Adobe Systems to allow this book to be released boggles the imagination. I will never purchase one of their books without having a copy in my hands for inspection and review.Granted Adobe Golive is not a first tier application at Adobe but can you imagine a book this bad being released if the subject was Photoshop or Acrobat?
1,Error filled book.,I've bought a lot of computer books over the years and this has to be one of the worst. The number of errors is unacceptable. It leaves me with little confidence in the GoLive software.
1,Extremely Disappointing,"After being so impressed with Illustrator CS Classroom in a Book, I forked over the money for this one and would like it back. Learning a new software program is difficult enough when you have accurate instructions. With incorrect instructions you have to spend extra time deciding if you don't understand or if the book is wrong. Don't buy this book unless you have time and money to waste."
1,Time for a Recall,"I consider myself an intermediate software engineer, and this book was written way too fast, and released for publication even faster. It's better than nothing (not many ""Go Live"" books out there) but I wish I'd waited to spend my money on something better written AND USEFUL. C'mon Adobe - you're better than this!!"
2,Don't buy it until it is in sync with the software,"I can only agree with the other comments on this book. It is VERY irritating when a book, with step-by-step instructions, doesn't reflect the software. When a step doesn't work the way it is told and nothing happens... what do you do? Skip the lesson? First major ""bug"" is already on page 18!(It is however possible to make the Section Icon ""snap"" to the Main page if you first export the Main page to PDF!!!)I bought this book because I've just run through the InDesign book in the same series, and I was impressed that they always seemed to read your mind in every step. If there was a slight possibility to do wrong, you were guided into the right direction again."
1,"useless, don't buy it!","I should've trusted other reviewers here and skip this book. What a waste of money and time.I am an hardware engineer and know HTML and have built basic websites using HTML coding, but would like to build websites that looks more slick. That's why I purchased Adobe CS ( for the photoshop and illustrator). since goLive is part of the suites I thought I'll learn goLive and redo some of my old sites.after going through all the chapters, you would only learn a couple of things about this software: where the buttons are, how to use the pick to make links, etc.it does not explain to you how the software works -- which is what I'd be looking for when I learn a new software.bad book. worthless."
3,I nearly gave up,I read the reviews and then hoped for the best as I could not find another book which would help me learn this programme. I use a MAC and I am reasonably computer savvy soI hoped I would be able to find some work-arounds if needed. All went well until Ch 8 when there were no scroll bars but by reducing the page size I could see what I needed. Ch 9 was the worst. To start with I had a copy of the finished file to pratice on. By deleting bits then trying to replace them I managed to do some of it but there were other problems as well. If I hadn't read the reviews I'd have given up at that point but fortunately the remaining chapters were almost trouble free. I have learnt a lot and I am confident I can create a simple web site using this programme. My other criticism is that the book tells you what to do but seldom explains why so although I have finished it I feel I still have an awful lot to learn so I understand the programme
2,Another Blair B-Bomb,"This movie, in which Linda Blair's character becomes romantically involved with an Australian of questionable morals, actually features a rather solid storyline, as well as a decent performance by Linda, but is dragged down by the poor performance of the male lead. Male viewers might agree that the movie's high point is the shower scene!"
5,Great fly swatter,I love the flexible plastic because it doesn't crack like the more brittle ones and doesn't fray like the metal ones.
2,Brittle plastic,"Shipped in a BIG GIANT box which made me laugh, so it has that going for it. Happily swatted flies for a few weeks before it snapped near the base of the plastic swatter. I sort of glued it back together and it is working again but the brittleness of the plastic leads me to believe that these are very old, from a stock of swatters molded in the 80s or something."
1,Swat in the trash!,I swung at a fly on my wall once and it broke in half. Cheaply made. I am very dissapointed with this product. I don't reccomend it at all to anyone.
5,Hooked on Trout Run,"SWALLOW THE HOOK, SW Hubbard's second Trout Run mystery starring police chief Frank Bennett, is no sophomore slump effort! As Frank Bennett grows more comfortable in his small Adirondacks beat, his relationships with local folk grow increasingly funny and real. The story is absorbing and the village of Trout Run with its surrounding wilderness comes alive through Hubbard's words. Highly recommended!"
5,I am hooked on Frank Bennett,"Another successful mystery from SW Hubbard. Hubbard manages to lead you in one direction for clues to the mystery but then starts tugging you into other possiblities for suspects. I like the town, the people and the banter between Frank and his deputy. I would love to ""meet"" his daughter in another mystery book. Looking forward to other publications"
5,Second in Hubbard Trilogy - Great Read,"I enjoyed this second book of the trilogy S.W. Hubbard wrote. Again, the story was compelling and the characters believable. It was a little hard to keep up with the sheer number of characters, but upon a second reading, the story was just as good - even better!"
5,Applying Ranger Knowledge to Business,"In my view the author does the impossible himself by applying the vast knowledge and wisdom he gained as an elite combat Ranger in the Vietnam war to the complexities faced in civilian organizations. The learnings are certain to help organizations as they strive to achieve competitive advantage. The book is filled with interesting case studies and meaningful quotations that help the reader grasp the practical value of applying Ranger knoledge to strategic planning and problem solving. This is a must book for all who are iterested in help with the challenge of keeping their organization vital. David Tanner, Founding Director, Dupont Center for Creativity & Innovation."
5,Comprehensive is right,"Though this thick grammar is a translation of a Dutch work, it is the best thing I could find on Spanish. The length may put off those who are only casually interested in the language, but others will appreciate getting such minor questions as how to say numbers ( 'mil quinientos' and never 'quince cientos' ) answered. The book is linguistically sound, and sentences from novels and newspapers are used as evidence to support the grammatical rules. Conversely, the book does not waste space. The treatment of irregular verbs uses easily learned patterns rather than a brute listing of forms."
4,Korn finally decided to write something good,"Have you seen Tomb Raider the Cradle Of Life, if so you would of heard this song, or heard a clip from the website. So then, what most people do, is by the soundtrack, wanting this song. But they don't find it. For some reason they didn't put it on there, it's okay but nothing without Korn. So I had to buy this CD and it's pretty good. I like the original did my time and the graveout mix but the song the one, put Korn in the crapper! They need to take it out I think!"
3,Not really worth it...,"""Did My Time"" is going to be on the new CD coming out in two months, so you don't really need to get it now. Unfortunately, their version of ""One"" isn't very good. Jonathan misses the cue once, and the guitar solos are terrible. Then they completely cut out the dueling guitars at the last three minutes of the song. Save your money and wait for the new album. If you really want the song, you can get if from Korn's web site."
2,"Going, going, gone...","Ever since they released their self titled album back in 1994 it's been a downhill ride musically for Korn. They pretty much pioneered the nu-metal genre along with the Deftones. While the Deftones have gone to make better music, Korn is constantly getting worse and Did My Time is evidence of this. The riffs are simple and the lyrics are nothing to jump for joy over. It's clear they haven't picked up on any of their bad habits (musically) since the release of their self titled album. Save your[money amount]and pass on this. If you really want a Korn album, stick to the first two."
1,"SAVE your MONEY, TIME,and EDUCATION","I haven't read this book but I am familiar with their high school prep book for catholic students. There are at least 100 incorrect answers in the book. They even give an incorrect formula for the area of a circle. If a student really uses this book they will miss every math question that involves circles! I would have put this review under the title of that book but the new edition is not out yet, and its not taking reviews. Get any book but these!"
1,What could be worse than a math book full of wrong answers?!,"The scenario is almost like a fictitious evil plot--a math book with wrong answers! I picked this up for my sons who are preparing for the SAT. I have plenty of other resources, but I find it useful to get various perspectives and get a variety of problems to work through. I was reading through and working some of the problems myself seeking good examples to demonstrate the concepts. I repeatedly found egregious errors in the solved examples--not a simple typo, but wrong values carried throughout the solution! To top it off, I found misspellings. Those are bad enough, but could almost be forgiven, but blatant math errors?!Don't even take this book if someone offers it for free; it's negative training!"
2,Not enough flotation,"I got this TYR kickboard long time ago, and also quit using it long time ago.The reason is it has a big enough surface area, but very thin compared to other brands.I just don't like it at all."
2,Not as effective as others,"Although this board is for adults, it does not support as much weight as other brands. It's not nearly as effective it terms of helping you practice gliding or kicking. It's probably more useful for young teens. Maybe I'll use it for holding my 6-pack of beer in the pool since it seems sturdy for that."
4,Very comfortable,Very soft. I sleep with them very comfortably.If you wash them they become difficult to reinsert.
5,Can't hear the television!,"Blocks out enough noise that I can hardly hear my boyfriend blasting the TV at night, but can still hear the alarm clock by my head to wake up in the morning.These ear plugs are relationship savers. Inexpensive enough that when the parrot chews 'em up, it's not a huge loss."
2,"Blocks noise, but enhances conversations","I bought these to wear on a US to Europe flight. I was hoping they would help reduce the amount of noise on the plane and therefore help me to sleep better. They worked well at reducing the white noise (e.g. engine noise, humming, etc...), but by doing that it actually enhanced the voices and conversations I was hearing - it made them come through more clear. I was better off having the engine noise drown out some of the chatter. Dissapointing for me so beware if you're buying them for travel."
1,Defective batch?..expands before you can put in ear..,"I've used this model earplug before, but had purchased them in a different format (i.e. bulk size, or smaller packs..). They usually worked pretty well for me..the problem I have with this batch that I ordered is that when you roll the ear plug between your fingers to compress them so that they can slide into your ear, most of the ear plugs in this batch just automatically expand back to full size instantly, before you have the chance to put it in your ear!!.. it's really annoying when you're tired/want to go to sleep but have to ""try on"" multiple ear plugs before you find one that will remain compressed for a couple seconds, enough time to put it in your ear.. maybe I was unlucky with a bad batch, but it makes me want to look at a different model earplug.."
3,Does the trick,"These were a little pricey, but they protect your ears. No complaints, other than a carry case would've been nice."
4,"SOFT, COMFORTABLE, AND SOUND REDUCING EAR PLUGS","I'm a high school student. These earplugs are very soft. It does its job: it really does reduce noises around you. I use earplugs at libraries, study hall and pretty much whenever I need to concentrate without the interruptions from my surroundings. These ear plugs really are great. I would recommend this product if you like soft ear plugs. i feel like I'm all set till I go to college. The only thing that i don't like about is its size. I was very used to using bigger ear plugs and when I first used these, I worried that i might not be able to take them out because they were really small. As I got used to them, now I feel more comfortable using these. But if you are not very comfortable with small earplugs, then you can be very easily irritated."
3,56NET Modem Setup Problems,"I purchased the Best Data 56NET Internet Sharting modem recently and now have it up and running. This modem performs the best of 7 different brands and types used for my setup. I had a incredible time getting the modem to dialup, due to some misinformation in the quick start guide. The proper way to setup this modem is to read the manual that is on the CD-Rom. Also the insructions to use the New Connection Wizard did not suit my liking. It wanted to treat the connection as always on, so I had to reinstall the old modem and delete the first setup and start over. The performace once setup properly is excellent. Getting to that point was very frustrating is why it only gets 3 stars in my opinion. No tech service available toll free. 30 minutes on hold. No email response in timely manner. Give it a try, but read the complete CD-Rom setup manual first.WC"
1,S-L-O-W............,While this product does provide wireless internet from a dial up connection ~ it sets a new low standard for slow connection speeds. Two attempts to contact the company about the speed issue through technical support and their website went unanswered. Guess they don't care how their product works.
1,"No sound, no picture. Returned.",I tried to watch the movie but the sound is very poor.A very bad reproduction. Do not buy.
5,Fun with construction paper creations,"Cut-Paper Play is an excellent collection of over 80 kid-approved construction paper creations for children ages 4 to 10. The projects are grouped by 3 different skill and difficulty levels. A variety of techniques is shown. All you need is different kinds of paper or cardboard, scissors, glue, sometimes yarn or a stapler. So the crafts are inexpensive, but very amazing. Two- and three-dimensional projects, mobiles and seasonal projects are shown. We got inspiration for many more paper projects for the future!"
5,Great Kids Craft Idea Book,"I got a good number of well received children craft ideas from this book for 4th through 6th grade kids, which were the level 3 crafts. The level 1 & 2 crafts are too simple for this age range of kids, but should be fine for K through 3rd grade kids. I also got several other very good craft ideas from Ms. Henry's other book, ""Kids Art Works."""
3,OK,I usually love all of the books in the Williamson Kids series and found a few ideas I'll use in this one.
5,I want Chris in my home,"This show was excellent. I loved it, it was so cleaver and witty. Who knew Chris was so good at acting. I've seen him in a couple shows as a guest spot (""FRIENDS"" is the one that comes to mind.)I hope they release all the shows on DVD. There are many people who did enjoy this show.There are even shows out on DVD who didn't even make an entire season that they have released. I hope they put on any un-used episodes on the DVD as well. As well as some behind the scenes footage."
5,CASH!,"I have cash! Do you want it? The show isn't exactly gaining in popularity right now. You're all missing the boat. Enough already. Hey Chris, if you burn it yourself I'll buy a copy at your next show."
5,STILL Waiting!,"Please, Viacom, we want DVDs of the great shows. My fav series!Why is this not available.I want to show them to friends who missed the original series. I was so sorry it didn't run longer."
5,No release....,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this show.....BUT....I have read that due to ""copywrite"" issues with all the music and such, they will NOT be releasing this show on DVD. Too much of a LEGAL hassel for them to deal with."
4,Why not yet released?,"Usually the hang up for getting a show such as this on DVD is the music rights. Rights must be negotiated and purchased separately for each mode of distribution (i.e. the rights purchased for the original Showtime airing do not cover the DVD release.) More people in suits are involved, and sometimes the financial payback is just not worth the effort. Just my best guess as to why there has not been a DVD release of this great show."
5,Great show,"This was really a great show, funny with diverse guest musicians. I would surmise the hold-up may be due to cross-licensing issues tied to the musical guests and their music / performances."
3,not too bad!,"This movie is pretty damn good as far as action is concerned.Plus it wasn't made in the ""olden days"",it made in the 90's.It stars Jean Carlo(actually Chin Kar Lok,Chin Sui Ho's younger brother) who definately has some great skill.The fights are good,but not as good as the,""olden days"" fighting put out by the Yuen clan and other early 80's choreographers."
2,Legend of the Drunken Tiger,"This DVD version is dubbed and the English dubbing really takes away the essence of the movie. Also, if you're going to use dubbing, then the voices have to be native English speakers, not someone who speaks with a very heavy accent. People buy foreign films because they are attracted to the exotic culture and language, and to take away the language and replace it with bad English is really dumb! The action scenes are not so bad, when one thinks that this film was made in the ""olden days"". But one has to say that they are nothing compared to modern martial arts films, with the skills of Jet Li and Jacky Chan."
3,A Beginner's Guide to P3,"For the big price, this book was a big disappointment. The first four chapters are devoted to the fundementals of Project Management, and yet nowhere in the book is Work Breakdown Structure even mentioned. If you're new to Project Management and P3, this would be a good place to start. If you want to get the most out of Primavera though, you'll need to look elsewhere."
1,Save your money.,"Am 100% pissed about losing $100 buying this piece of crap. Everyone familiar with Primavera knows that Primavera has written an excellent program P3 e/c especially for construction. I assumed Marchman knew this as well. After reading Chapter 4 (the first 80 pages being on general scheduling concepts for virgins), I tried to set up his sample project on a copy of the P3 e/c software. NO WAY. Far too much stuff was left out of the book such that it was 100% worthless. Very possible it may work on P3 e. However, as Primavera has had the P3 e/c out for quite some time, and construction companies are widely using P3 e/c -- why bother? Note that one other review rates this book as ""terrible"". If you read closely the remaining reviews, as of May 5, 2004, you will find they are actually for Marchman's Primavera P3 book, and are incorrectly placed here."
3,Paying for the brand name,You can get a third-party one on eBay for one dollar. There's nothing better about one made by Nikon.
3,Don't buy this! Just get a knockoff for $1,"There's really no reason to buy brand name with this. Get on some auction site or otherwise search around and you can get a set of rear lens cap + body cap for like $3 or something. (You're going to want another body cap anyway.) Seriously, it's just a molded piece of plastic. Any factory in China can make one of these, and not surprisingly, several are."
5,Nikon LF-1 Rear Lens Caps,"the owner cal me twice , the item receive and in good shapeIwill buy from them for certain...........excellent compagny"
5,It does what it was designed to do!,"This rear lens cap does what it designed to do....protect the rear glass element on your lens. I found myself with some vintage lenses which, although clean, did not include front and rear lens caps. I bought several to take care of this....prevent dust and debris from getting inside, as well as prevent damage. I prefer this older design to the rear lens cap that is included with some of the newer lenses."
4,Nikon rear Lens Cap,"What do you say, it's a plastic rear lens cap. Wish it was cheaper, but Nikon is over priced, so what do you want? It fits like a charm like a stock would. It does the job, I bought it, and would again if need be."
5,Perfect,I bought this for my 50mm 1.8 lens for my nikon d5100 since it only came with the cheap piece of plastic that just covered and I wanted something more secure so I wouldn't have to worry about it coming off in my camera back and it is a perfect fit for the 50mm 1.8 lens and the 18-55mm kit lens and the 55-200mm lens that I purchased also. If and when I purchase any other lenses if they don't have the rear lens cap I will definately be purchases one of these for each lens.
4,Worth every penny.,"The Bower 2x 72mm Telephoto Lens does exactly what it should for a very low price. I use it for an HDV video camera and it works great when zoomed in between 75% and 95%. When zooming in all the way, the lens produces some chroma shift and when zooming out there is heavy vignetting (tunnel vision), but in that sweet spot it delivers a nice close-up. Overall for the money (which is less than 10% of it's high-end compeditors), it is a good lens."
3,Not for the typical user?,Received this item and immediately had to try it out. Easy enough attaching this to the end of my Ultrasonic 29-135mm lens. I began to take a few pictures and noticed a fuzzy haze surrounding all of my photos. I began playing with the settings and could not eliminate the fuzzy haze around the photos. I am using the auto focus on a Cannon EOS 40D that normally takes beautiful high quality photos. I have read many reviews after the fact of buying this item and notice many people with the same issue. I guess I will have to read a bit more and see if it is my lack of knowledge in photography or the quality of the product itself.
3,ready for more,"This is a very good horror comic series. It's not going to change your life or anything. Both the story and artistry are good, not outstanding. If you like zombie stuff, you should get this. You'd like it a lot.I titled my review ready for more because while I'm not blown away, I certainly would like to keep reading this series. Fortunately, I've got a brother in a comic shop, so I don't have to pay retail!!"
2,Boring if you have seen the series on tv,For a comic book it is exactly what you would want but if your not a fan of comics than pass. It goes right along with the series which is a great show!
2,Zombies & A Dimwit,"My sister mentioned the TV show to me so I started to watch it and I thought I would give the graphic novels a try. The characters come across as bland; they are more colorful in the show. I would rate this higher if the lead male character was more likeable. I kept thinking ""he's a bit of an airhead, what a dimwit"". He often had a dopey expression on his face. Is it wrong that I liked the zombies more than the living? The story was simple enough and I liked the grotesque illustrations enough. I must admit the ending was abrupt and odd; it made little sense to me. I thought it was dumb. It could've been improved with a possible ending that had a tad of closure yet still open-ended for the story to-be-continued. For example the last picture could be one of them leaving the campsite."
4,Nice!,"Not having much exposure to graphic novels or comics, I was impressed at how enjoyable this story was to read. A good zombie fix that's blessedly free of plot holes and other flaws that tend to trouble this genre.It's over way to fast, but it's good."
5,The Walking Dead,I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead books and show. I would definitely recommend all the books for any Walking Dead fan :) This particular book arrived quickly and in very good condition for a used version.
5,walking dead is amazing,"This book should have held no secrets for me, I have seen all the shows and know that story. When reading this book I found I know the players, but there are subtle differences that make huge changes. Read it!"
5,Great zombie comic!,"What a great start for me reading Walking Dead! Good storyline, flows well throughout, and zombies everywhere! Would highly recommend :)"
5,Great!,"I watched season 1 & 2 before I read the graphic novel, so I came in with expectations. It really exceeded all of them. Great artwork! Great story!"
5,great start to the series,This book starts out great with the introduction into the world of the walking dead. I look forward to the many more volumes.
4,Better than the show. Not mind blowing.,"Most people who like the show arent even aware that there was first a comic. Which is sad but because the book is way better. And I love zombie movies/shows. In the book we don't have that annoying ass hick that everyone seems to love in the show. Thank heavens.The art in here is sold though not amazing. It fits the Image comic genre well. The zombies are satisfyingly grotesque. The characters are for the most part distinguishable and unique. Though with it being a black and white title I find that too many of the female charcters tend to blend into eachother and you find yourself going ""wait who is she again?"". But over all the art works and fits well with the writing.The writing and story are strong but like other people will mention, not shockingly original. Robert is coming far away from the likes of Battle Pope but he pulls it off. I wont spoil the story for you but never get attached to any one character. That would be a mistake."
4,Cool book,Never read a book like this but was intriguing and was awesome to see the differences from the show. Would recommend it to walking dead fans who have only watched the show like myself.
5,In credible,"I came here after watching the seasons and thanks to a friend, it really turned out better than I expected I looked forward to the rest of them"
5,Some of the best zombie writing ever,If you're a fan if the show but haven't read the comics you don't know what you're missing. I read these as they came out and now I'm rereading through the tpb's. Great writing and art. Kirk man is at the top if the zombie heap with Romero and Brooks. So good!
5,Count me a new fan.,"I'll keep this short. I've never been a fan of graphic novels of any sort. But then I got hooked on the show (though season 2 was awful) and read a lot of good reviews by people who, like me, never cared for graphic novels. Well, I'm hooked. Once I started I couldn't put it down. The b&w artwork, the dialogue...top notch. I plan on ordering the entire series asap."
5,Loved it!,This was great! it was a quick read but twas great for anyone into zombies. I watched the TV show on AMC first and the book is much better
3,"Not the best intro, but it's VERY worth it to keep going","Some of the more negative reviews of this first Walking Dead book are quite merited. In many ways it feels derivative, even a bit lazy. I'd only like to add that the series does get better, a whole heck of a lot better. Read this first one just so you can get to know the characters, but if you're feeling put off, do yourself a favor and keep going. By the time I was halfway through the second book I was hooked hooked hooked, and I devoured the rest of them as fast as I could. These have some of the best character development I've ever seen in any media, let alone in comic books, which are NOT known for their depth.Kirkman has made a decent name for himself in this business, and The Walking Dead series is a fantastic testament to his deserving respect."
3,I've bought all so far,"I did this in reverse of most people - I watched the show and then bought the graphic novels. The storyline is awesome and pretty much the same, but, truth be told, I like where the TV show is headed as compared to the graphic novels. I understand there's only so much you can do with one or two plots, but by the time you get to the fifth or sixth book, you have a hard time keeping all of the stories straight.If you absolutely have to choose between the graphic novels and buying the show on Blu-Ray, go with the show."
3,First Book Without Pages,"I had just gotten my Kindle Fire during the midseason break of season three of The Walking Dead. I wanted to try out reading a book without pages for some time but had gotten cold feet until my momma gave this new toy for Christmas.Missing my show and not ready to jump into a full-blown book just yet, I gave the first edition of The Walking Dead comics a try and really enjoyed it. Very well drawn and great to see some old friends again. Very quick read makes me hesitant to get the next issue, as I'd like to try something a little longer, but no spoilers for anyone that has finished the first two seasons of the AMC show."
3,More squinting,"Great story, great graphics, but the text was too small to show up well on my Kindle. Very difficult to read."
5,Amazing,"You won't want to put this book down or any of his Walking Dead books for that matter. People say Zombie stories are over played, but Zombies like any genre will remain a success as long as the story is told well and Robert Kirkman knows how to tell the story well. Do yourself a story, pick up the first two volumes, Volume 1 is an intro trade, a very good one, but once you're done you'll want Volume 2 right away."
3,"Meh, I like the show better","I'm a fan of the show and of comics so a friend gave this to me as a gift. I have to give it a meh across the board. Maybe if I hadn't seen the show first I would be more into it, but, I'm not sure. The art is ok. Nothing particularly original in style or technically great. The author mentioned the artists great style and being thankful to have him inside the book...not sure how happy the author is now, since the artist is trying to sue him for TV money. I read the book before I found out about the ridicilous lawsuit, so my opinion is not jaded by that. Honestly, I thought 30 Days of Night was much more groundbreaking than this book. Again, maybe I'm jaded because I like the show, but I really wasn't drawn to continue reading this series. Just seemed sort of run-of-the-mill zombie story."
4,Best Graphic Novel of 2004,"Brilliant artist Tony Moore takes a superb script by Robert Kirkman to give us a fresh retelling of the ""zombie world order"" horror story. Inkwash over pen and ink works perfectly to convey a human tale of survival at the end of civilization. This book is a character study with examples of courage, cooperation and compassion balanced by equally well rendered paintings of human fear and envy. I usually walk by black and white comic books, but this one wouldn't have been as good in color. 2004 is not quite halfway over, but I doubt I'll read a work of fiction this year I'll enjoy more."
5,Amazing,"It was everything I thought it would it would be like and more, couldn't put it down. Starting volume 2 now! Must read for any can of the tv show or even if you haven't seen it and just enjoy zombies."
5,Brilliant comic,I bought this as a present for my boyfriend who had just been watching the tv series and he loved it. The art work is amazing and I'm sure he'll be buying more of them soon. Really great product.
5,Wow,I love the show and the books and just now read this comic....Amazing!!!!!!!! Better than the show!!!!!! Buy it buy it buy it it's sooooo worth it!!!!!
5,My son loves these books.,"My son is 12 and doesn't read a lot unless something really catches his attention. He loved this series so much he read the first three books within 4 days. They have a comic book quality, but plenty of dialog to go with the pictures. His last series was The Hunger Games, so he is an above average reader. Hopefully that helps gauge whether or not these are appropriate for your child."
5,FREAKIN' AWESOME!,"We've Been watching the Walking Dead on AMC and I decided to start checking out the comic since I never knew about it til I watching ""talking dead""! The artwork is AMAZING! Would've bought it just for that!"
2,Like A Zombie ...,"A friend recently loaned me the first few graphic novels in this series, and I have to say, the writing was like a zombie going through the motions, shambling forward in a sequence of uninteresting and predictable steps. And like a zombie, this lacked the spark of life that I think distinguishes such comics as The Sandman, Fables, Last Man, etc.Using zombies as a device should have been a no-brainer (pun intended), but to totally rely on this device without bringing more to the table gives one a huge sense of been there, done that. While not a total disaster, this was definitely flat reading propped up by the occasional grotesque image to keep it in any way interesting."
1,No Kindle version for Vol 1?!?!,"I have enjoyed the AMC series of TWD so I thought I would try out the comics. Unfortunately, you can buy every volume of TWD for the Kindle....EXCEPT Vol 1! Why would anyone want to start with Vol 2?"
3,Ugg. Totally Not Into It.,"Perfect example of what hype does... Hype sells these types of graphic novels more than the story does. If enough people enjoy something it gets popular. Look at McDonalds. This is way too mainstream. It's cliché after cliché. Boring. Guns, Zombies, and Cops. Couldn't get more boring. It's so boring and so predicable that it seems like a Junior High School student wrote it. Similar story to Stephen King's Cell. Why would I care about a cop trying to find his family? That's just my opinion so don't get your panties in a bunch you fanboys. I'm entitled to my opinion as much as you are... and I didn't like it."
2,The TV show is so much better!,"**Spoiler alert**I've read this first one. We have books 1-3, but so far, I much prefer the tv series to this graphic novel.The artwork is amazing! A++ The only downside is it's in black and white.That being said, I thought the book is too way too much different than the tv show for me.The book moved too fast. Things happened in this first book that didn't happen till later in the tv episodes.I also didn't like the ending. Without saying too much, Someone important dies at the end of this book. I really don't see where it will go from there. I think killing off this character will probably make the series boring. I don't know though. I guess I'll have to wait and see."
4,Awesome,Really enjoyed this book. Kirkman makes you care for the characters and even a few of the zombies like the one Rick goes back and shoots on his way to Atlanta.It's a read good read and I would recommend to anyone.
5,Good comic!,"Yeah the story is a bit different than the show, but it's a good read and worth collecting as I haven't collected comics since I was a kid. I wish I would've known about the compedium's especially since they are up to vol. 17 or 18, but since I started on the single volumes I'll just slowly work my way up."
5,LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT,"I can't express in words just how great this graphic novel is...but I will try anyway.From the intriguing opening page to the suspensful conclusion of this wonderful story, I was simply in awe. I have already purchased and read book 2 and 3 which keeps snowballing this supurb story into comic book history. I recommend this book and all the others in this series very highly.If you have read the descriptions of this book already you probably know that this isn't just some ""horror"" comic, but it is a character driven sociological dream come true. Please give this a chance, I swear you won't regret it."
4,A good look at your fellow man in crisis,"Following the George A Romero spirit of the dead rising again, this book looks more at the way survivors treat each other in their fight to survive themselves. Funny how some people risk everything for each other, and others stand back and watch people die thinking they are saving their own skins, but instead killing themselves in the end (safety in numnbers) Focusing less on the Zombies, and gore, it teaches a good lesson about treating your fellow man."
2,Enough,"I'v been checking the comic and I think the art hasn't got the quality you expect with the drawings techniques in these days, it's fine if you like them in black and white. But, am I the only one that thinks the begin of Walking Dead Vol. 1, is very similar to the begin of ""28 days later""? A man wakes up in a hospital and finds himself in the middle of a mess, nobody can help him, alone."
2,Nothing new here.,"I had great hopes for this graphic novel. Generally each film or book brings something new to the genre even if they aren't of the highest quality. This dull piece of work actually managed to bring yawns to the table. The so so artwork is only topped by the ho hum story. My advice is avoid, go online and read some of the many amateur zombie works that far out class this stinker."
1,"Pass on this over-hyped, lack luster writer","A friend gave me the first four volumes of The Walking Dead as a birthday gift, knowing that I loved good zombie stories.The story starts by completely lifting the beginning of the film 28 Days Later. This book started only a few months after that film came out, so I guess Robert Kirkman figured people who enjoy this genre would just forget about it.Kirkman's writing is presentational, convoluted, and overly worded. Big shock that he's a huge fan of commas. He has his characters speak about what they're going to do at length, then complete the action in no time; no doubt to leave more panels in the book for Kirkman's brillant (in his mind) dialogue.The pacing is poor. The characters are trite. This is nothing new. You've seen it before and done much better. How this writer sells books amazes me. Wake up, people. The real zombies are the ones who continually read this guy's stuff."
1,Zombies don't have to equal misogyny . . .,"But in this comic, they do. I read the first couple issues, because I was intrigued by the concept -- I like post-apocalyptic fiction of all kinds. But the portrayal of women started out iffy and only got worse as the series went on. I'll spend my money elsewhere next time."
3,great book but foolish use of profane language,"For the genre of graphic novel, I thought this book was excellent.The pace of building to a climatic point, Rick vs. Shane, is excellent.I give it a three because its use of profane language adds nothing to the story. It detracts and serves to limit the book's appeal."
5,Finally can catch up,"Man! Received the next day! Now that we have to wait another 8 months or so for the other half of the season, I figured i'd start reading the books. So far so good!"
5,Great,If you are getting this thinking it is going to follow the story from the tv show exactly you will be dissappointed because it does not. There are things from the show that are in the comics though. If you are a fan of the feel of the world of the tv show I think you will love the comics.Robert Kirkman has created has created an incredibly interesting world and characters that feel real. This is becoming one of my favorite comics. I recommend this to any fan of of the tv show and to anyone that may be getting tired of the regular superhero comics.
5,Good stuff.,Excellent comic! This is a prime example of when art and story combine to make a truly wonderful reading experience.
3,Kirkman is a genius...,"I more fondly appreciate Kirkman after reading the first issue. Having said that, the show is so much better. Graphic novels aren't my cup of tea. The art is great, the story was way too sparse."
5,WOW,IT JUST CONTINUES TO IMPRESS MEWOW THIS IS JUST CONTINUING TO IMPRESS ME AND THE WORLD THE.I CAN'T BELEIVE THIS BOOK HAS SO MUCH ESUSPENS
5,The Ongoing Zombie Story,"Wow! I loved this book! It was very touching and kept me excited all the way through, I was very surprised as i was reading it. It started out like ""28 days later"" in the way that the main character was in a short coma and just woke up after the world had gone to hell. I even loved how he worked in the dilusional(sp?) person in the way that he thinks someone is gonna just ""Save the world"" and it'll all be better. I think that no other zombie movie has done anything like this and since this is a graphic novel, we don't have to worry about sucky movies that try to do the same as the first, and a constant change of actors and actreses (with the exception of The Great George A. Romero), no this is an on going story and it brings a diffrent spice into the genre that i thing has been missing all these years. I really liked it and am enjoying the rest of the series.J.Kie"
1,sadly disappointed,"I bought the Philips 15"" LCD TV Nov. 04 for $429 from Costco. It now has two black circles on the screen where the bulbs have self destructed. Not exactly 60,000 hour life expectancy of the bulb. When I called Philips, they said the warranty has expired, but if I were to return it to them, they would give me a factory reconditioned unit for mere $300. Considering I can buy a new one for about the same price, I declined their offer. What a disappointment."
2,"OK, at best----","The picture is OK. The sound varies widely. If set so the spoken word is at the right level, the background music overpowers the voices. Commercials blast you out of the room. Using a set of computer speakers instead of the on board speakers helps reduce the variation. The remote control died after a couple of months. Spent $5 or so on a battery and that wasn't the problem. Bought a new universal remote and have not been able to access all of the menu controls so I can't experiment any further with the sound. Can't seem to access all menu functions from the buttons on the TV. It would be worth the extra hundred bucks to buy a better brand."
2,"Decent TV, Terrible Customer Service - Update","The TV works fine, but the remote didn't work from day 1. I called Philips* they made me copy and fax my receipt* wait two weeks for a confirm number* package the remote and mail it back at my expense ($8).* I still don't have a remote - 2 months after purchase.Update - 6 weeks after mailing in my broken remote (that was broken when it came out of the box) - I rec'd the same broken remote mailed back to me today. I jumped through every hoop imaginable and they just mailed it back. Avoid Philips at all cost.UPDATE - After finally replacing the remote at my own cost, I enjoyed the TV for about 10 months until the video component went out. I still have audio, but no picture which kind of defeats the purpose of have a teleVISION. I called Philips and was told (like the others) that the TV is not under warranty and I could purchase a refurb unit for $299. I'll never buy from Philips again."
3,PRODUCT QUALITY,"This in not a great product sepcially the remote control is veryflimsy, the battery holder has some free room so that it createloose or no contact, I try to fix it but I am not sure how longit will last. This is the product quality control problem, anotherthing is viewing angle is very limit.and lastly isthe color is flat. I do hope the PHILIPS will look into it!"
1,POS,"I bought this little TV 1-1/2 years ago. I had no problems with it and was quite happy. . . Until I came home this evening and - voila! - no picture. Sound is fine but screen is black. It was around $400 which isn't a fortune, but I certainly expect more life than that. I'm sure that trying to get it repaired is not worth my time, money or aggravation. Believe me, I will never, ever buy a Philips product again!!"
3,"LCD TV OK, but there's much better out there now.","I bought this LCD TV hoping to hookup to my laptop, purchased the cable that was in the instruction manual and it didn't work. Screen resolution was OK, I've seen better now. This is old school LCD TV, so I returned it when the unit could not hookup to my laptop."
1,After 2 years .....,TV played great - had built in made in new kitchen for this one. Was watching and poof a black screen. Called Philips - Can not correct this problem it is a total failure - offered me nothing - TV is only 14 months old. I will never buy a Philips product again!
1,"Great sound, horrible DVD","The sound on this system is really fantastic for the price, but I've had the same experience as the other reviewer. The DVD skips constantly, and Phillips is absolutely no help in fixing the problem. Amazon has been great and has offered to give a 50% credit, but Phillips insists that I send (at my own expense) the machine to them and then wait 4+ weeks to have a 'possibly' refurbished unit. I'm quite disappointed with Phillips and its lack of customer service."
1,Don't buy from Philips!!,"This system is quite sleek, easy to fit in a cluttered living room. Assembly takes about two minutes. The instructions are very clear. The sound is amazing, especially when you put on your favorite loud, bass-heavy film. Why then do I give it one star?It skips. Like nobody's business. At first, my wife and I thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched. But then we put in new disks. No difference. When exactly does it skip? Impossible to tell. Sometimes a little. Sometimes every frame! Sometimes it'll tell us that disks are bad. Then the next time we put them in they magically work -- until they skip.So I called Philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping, but they could not guarantee that they would fix it, and it would take up to a month before they'd ship it back.Save your money! Buy from someone else!"
4,"A great value, excellent sound","We had this system for a year and a half, using it in a store seven days a week for about 10 hours/ day as a stereo system (never tried the video, that wasn't what we got it for). After that much abuse it finally gave up on us and wouldn't read discs, but we thought for the $170 it often runs at Target, it's hard to beat, value wise. The sound is quite excellent, the speakers are very easy to connect and set up, the remote is great, the treble and bass are very distinct and clear, hard to go wrong here for the price."
4,Great system for the price,"Just picked this up for $128 at Target over Christmas. This is our first sound system and great for someone who knows nothing about electronics. We haven't had any problems with skipping, humming or anything else. You can't beat the quality for the price and we are very satisfied. Highly recommended for anyone wanting decent sound without spending big bucks!"
3,Not First Rate ... IMHO!,"Received the product this morning ... only to find half of the box emptied in the shipping container with the packing material. What a mess ... thousand of tiny lentils everywhere. I hope that the inside of the shipping box was sanitary. These are expensive lentils at $10 a box and I think deserved better treatment. One additional observation was that there was no ""Best Used by Date"" on the box as indicated on the side box instructions. Maybe overseas exports are not stamped so you don't know how long they were sitting on some storage pallet in the importers warehouse. Otherwise everything else seemed OK."
1,Disappointing,"The inflation valve doesn't stay securely shut, so mine has been in use without the air (it still will stay put on our avergae sized toilet though). It's less comfortable but will still do its job. Because of the valve issue, I wouldn't recommend this item and would stick to the standard plastic bowl-type sitz baths."
4,This is a good video for the bad days that good boys have.,"My two boys have almost worn out this book AND the video. When given a choice, my 4 year old brings this one to preschool. Alexander wakes up one morning and it is all down hill from there. He is squished in the carpool, picked on at school, wrecks his dad's new copier machine and on top of it all, he can't get the 'cool' pair of shoes. What can be worse?? I sure hope they start producing this video again because I have promised the preschool a copy before my son graduates!"
3,Dig a little deeper and go for Greatest Hits,"For another 3 bucks (as of this writing), you get 21 songs instead of just 14.This does have two songs not on GH--""Turn Your Radio On"" and ""All I Do Is Think About You."" For most, these won't compensate for the loss of ""1941"", ""Cuddly Toy"", ""Girlfriend"", ""The Puppy Song"", ""Living Without You"", ""Good Old Desk"", ""You're Breakin' My Heart"", ""Don't Forget Me"", and ""As Time Goes By"". The earliest of these, especially ""1941"", show why the Beatles raved about Nilsson way back when. ""You're Breakin' My Heart"" is notable for its free use of the ""F"" word; funny, but maybe not essential. ""As Time Goes By"" was a minor hit from a standards album (A Touch of Schmillson in the Night) that was as uncommercial a move then as it is commercial now. Go figure.This man was brilliant. And that's coming from someone who is not a long-time fan; I only knew his biggest hits before buying GH. Spend a little and get a lot more. You won't regret it."
3,everybody's talkin,I have always thought that 'Evevybody's talkin' was one ofthe best songs of the mid 60s. That is what I purchased this cd for.Nilsson's other music is not consistent enough for me. Theother songs in this collection are a bunch of hodge podgeand mix match.
5,Nikon Body Cap,The body cap arrived on time. Serves its purpose. I bought it to store a Nikon camera body.
2,Ugh,"This is Leone's absolute worst film. Coburn and Steiger constantly lose their accents, and Morricone's score is terrible, full of early 1970's hippie strings and birdlike songs. The action consists strictly of blowing things up, which gets boring very quickly. Not a good film from a cinematic master."
1,Never got it.,"This DVD never got to me. I checked with my post office and it's vanished, apparently into thin air. I don't know what happened, except that I'm out $25 or so and have no DVD. I've wanted to see this for a few years now and am still not able to. I ain't happy."
4,Dark comedy about revolutionaries,"I would normally give this film five stars. However, this Spaghetti western substitutes a white, male actor to play the role of a Mexican bandit turned revolutionary.Admittedly, Rod Steiger is an excellent actor. But with so many talented Latino actors available to do the part of the Mexican bandit, one can only imagine how much better the film might have been. The story is engaging, and James Coburn's performance is memorable. The music by Enno Morricone adds to the film's appeal. SergioLeone's directing is clumsy in places, and juvenile in others. However, the film is a wonderful story about the bonding of two men from very different backgrounds,and they way one of them grows to a new potential and level of actualization. It is, therefore, a very entertaining film."
5,Great Spaghetti !!!,"If you like any of the Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Westerns, then you will also love this Sergio Leone classic. It didn't do great at the box office for various reasons, but it has been extremely underrated. A very well done western with some great actors. Highly recommended."
4,Nice Tank But Runs Small,"I bought three of these tanks recently. They are high quality and wash well (though I have avoided putting them in the dryer), and the colors are very pretty. I recommend ordering up one to two sizes, because they run small. In my case, I found I had to get an XXLarge for a comfortable, although still fairly close, fit. I normally wear a medium/large (size 10-12)."
3,small size,"Small sized, if you want roomy purchase up a size. Too a very long time to ship out and get it from the time I paid and ordered it."
5,Tech Step that doesn't get carried away,"A nice duo to hear put Tech Step and D&B flavors in motion. Tight synths with smooth arid flow = redemption for DJ Rap (last album was weak), BUT I STILL LOVE YOU BABY!!!. Big Ups to SOLAR! Can't wait for disc 2!! And if you get the chance to, check out Kenny Ken and Rap LIVE! You will not regret it! ENJOY!-The Delity"
2,"Shrek 2: 18"" Animated Shrek Figure Bank","Well, I got it on clearance and practically got it for free. But, if I was paying full price...I would have sent it back.The bank part might hold all of .75. The mouth part didn't work at all.But the rest of the animation and the songs were delightful.It was ok for a couple of dollars, but not full price."
1,for saxophonists,"there's not much to say except that with this cd, a ""prize-winning"" professor of saxophone at an esteemed university demonstrates the problem in the world of classical saxophone. How can anyone honestly release a cd that includes such bad musicianship, intonation and technique?"
4,quality nonfiction,"The true adventures of a Rhodes scholar, Harvard medical school graduate and published writer who could have easily settled down and lived a life of luxury. Instead this brilliant man chose to climb mountains, travel the world and pursue his dreams. His story is unique and interesting."
3,a Femaled-up Milenium,"I love the concept, and ofcourse the genre., So I had purchased the ""Season 1"" blind, and on a whim from a used store. I guess I was hoping for Milenium. What I got was an almost but not there. I mean Robert Davi in a cowboy hat flying in on hrlicopters...What is that? Stupid miscasts like that will defifitely cause a show to shark-jump. So I let the DVD's marinate for some time until I can watch it from the pilot and hopefully share with its fans. Maybe I'll purchase season 2 as an incentive.Kevin""I want to believe"""
1,No closed captioning,"I love this show but can not hear what is being said. How could A&E produce these DVD's without CC. Entertainment companies need to acknowledge that the people who watch these shows and buy the DVD's are of the older population and just do not hear as well as they use to. As for me being a senior citizen, I can little afford to buy from companies that do not provide CC."
1,I'll wait: Follow up: The wait is over.,"It's difficult to believe that at the price set for this DVD that the producers couldn't afford the rights to the music in episode 4.When most TV DVD sets are retailing for $50 to $60 they expect people to cough up $100 (Amazon does try to help with the discount) for an incomplete season.I'll wait for A&E; to get it right or not bother.The show was fairly descent back when it aired but eventually it will be released correctly and at $100 I have time to wait.Follow up:When I originally wrote this review in Jan 2005 this DVD actually was $100.Now that it's down to $25 it seems more reasonable, but I've moved on to better shows."
3,Darker series the most will like.,"The profiler is definatly a darker series then most would like, although I really enjoyed it. Most of the reviews i've read say they don't like the ""Jack"" sub-plot but I think it make's it more darker. It's like in Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lector. This season is the best place to start if you decide to watch this series. Being as though I say this the first time a round I may be biased. The first three seasons of this show are what made this series but the forth revamped the whole series and went down in flames. Ally Walker and Robert Davi flow so well as though they know what to do without direction."
2,Not worth it,"I can't understand why these DVD's cost so much. It's not like there are extras that would kick up the price. Sure, the show is amazing and I would love to buy it, but at this price? No. Way."
5,FAST SHIPPING,PERFECT CONDITION AS LISTED! VERY HAPPY JUST GETTING STARTED. I LOVE THIS SHOW AND IT HAS BEEN SO LONG SINCE I HAD SEEN IT I'M VERY EXCITED TO GET BACK INTO IT.
3,basic grammer,"Tapes and workbook are a review of grammer 101. Tapes, exercises in grammer like proper use of adjectives, adverbs, sentence structure etc. answer sheets included."
5,Great gift for a new father,A rare book by and for new fathers about his godgiven relationship with his son & trials they endure early on. I think every new father needs to read this - especially fathers hesitant about their new role
4,A good start for leadership,"This book is quite simple and organized in a concise manner regarding leadership but it contains very powerful messages. It will give you a good start in how you lead people. The book starts with ""Genuine leadership is of only one type: supportive."" which is quite simple yet true."
5,THE ART OF INTEGRITY,"I've read many books on management, and I've read many books on leadership, but J. Donald Walters, a successful entrepreneur who has several thriving and growing businesses in different industries, has done a masterful job of capturing and presenting the essence of true leadership in an inspirational coffee table book that eloquently and concisely defines what a true leader is, how a true leader thinks, and most importantly, what a true leader does.The person who is pressed for time, or short on patience, will take lessons away from this book that can improve their management skills and tranform their organization with integrity actions that build trust, engender devotion, and create a vortex of positive energy. Perfect for those graduating from business school, or those in a position of authority who are looking for sage advice and techniques on how to lead your organization or company to success in harmony. The price almost makes it free so ""steal"" your copy today."
5,A Postwar Classic,"This riveting tale of a Jewish gambler in postwar London deserves to be far better known. Seductive, insightful and ultimately thrilling, The Lowlife has just about everything, including a brilliantly rendered cast of characters and a protagonist you won't soon forget."
5,Finally!!!,"There has never been a book like this one! Ignorant customers of America read ""Dry up with a Twist."" That's an order!!!!"
4,"Dry, Up, With a Twist","Everyone should have to show proof that they read this book before being aloud to dine in a restaraunt! Mr. Galloway is very witty and clever in detailing the hypocrisy of those who fall short of the ""fine"" in fine dining. Thank you for introducing readers to the very interesting characters that you have encountered!"
5,Applause to Mr. Galloway,"For such a great read. I get the impression this is the author's first book, but I for one hope it is not his last. This book is a true tapestry, a woven tale of history, modern day references (introducing the chapters) and tragic beginnings. The often times exasperating experiences as a waiter are laugh out loud funny as well as pathetic. In the end, the author's fulfillment of his dreams and self are achieved making this a compelling story I hope you won't pass upon. Good work John-kudos to you and May all the best be yours."
5,"If you ever dine out, you must read Dry Up With A Twist","Brace yourself for this daring and unbelievably hilarious novel about the truth of fine dining. When you think you've heard it all, you turn the page and read something even more shocking. There were times I reread a section just to relive the sensation. This is a very well written novel."
5,"A Brilliant, Original, and Furiously Funny Book!","My headline says it all. Galloway goes where few, if any authors dare. I've never enjoyed a book as much as this, and just thinking about some of the passages makes me laugh.But there's much more to ""Dry, Up, with a Twist"" than just true-life humor. There's heartache, and mental angst as the author finds himself trying to find meaning and honor in his life. And where he's stuck is front house fine dining---bereft of such things.This book is also an education, and packed with things you never knew. All things ccoicnsidered, I give it an A+. It's only flaw is that it has an ending."
5,Idaho Review,"John mixes many facets of the restaurant business with his own personal experiences, which make the book very very interesting. The interesting thing about this book is the humor within it. It is a well crafted story that works on several different levels. Not only is it a hilarious account of John's many years in the fine dining industry, but it is also a critique of the restaurant business and the people invloved in it. John found a unique way to incorporate humor in his book... a lot of authors attempt humor in books while maintaining serious points throughout, but most simply fail. John did a great job in this book, and let the reader laugh and learn at the same time !!!"
5,A Great Find,"I was very glad to stumble across this book. Dry, Up with a Twist is a daringly original book. It is a well crafted story that works on several different levels. Not only is it a hilarious behind-the-scenes account of John's many years in the fine dining industry, but it is also a thought provoking critique of the restaurant business and the people invloved in it. Mr. Galloway holds nothing back in this book, he lets his former bosses, co-workers and customers have it, while maintaining his witty sense of humour throughout. Sometimes shocking, sometimes tragic, but always entertaining. I currently work in the service industry myself and I could instantly identify with John's tale. It's nice to know that there are sane people in this crazy business . I thoroughly enjoyed Dry, Up with a Twist and I am very glad to have stumbled across it."
5,A riotous look at the world of fine dining,"I picked up this book and didn't stop laughing for over two hours. Galloway's portrayals of chefs, waiters, busboys, and customers, among others, offers food for thought both humorously and sadly true-to-life. I learned the extent of my social faux pas and promise to tip on the full amount of the bill.The book is liberally sprinkled with word usage and situations that might not be appropriate for younger readers, but it provides vivid testimony as to why mamas don't want their babies to grow up to be waiters. Or chefs. Or restaurant owners."
5,Dry Up With a Twist,"Welcome to Dining 101. If as a guest you ever wondered what lurks behind the smile of your server well there you go.For those working the restaurant front lines well, revenge is a sweet thing isnt it?Hopefully, reading this book will remind diners that those working to make them happy are human beings, just as anyone else, and showing them a bit of respect would go a long way(and so would a good tip). The book is funny, educational and a good read."
5,awesome,"Great book. Well written by an itelligent man. I must say this is one of the better books I've read. Intresting from start to finish. I found it hard to put down at times. A good look at the business that goes on behind the scenes in fine dining!Loved the book,"
2,cricket tube,"It is plastic and way too expensive but it is very useful and time saving. The shipping was very slow, took over 10 days to get it, would not recommend buying from the seller."
3,"Good, but not great.","This book didn't live up to the amazon.com reviews I read. As a former JET participant myself, I found Ken's chronicle of his life on the JET program a bit flat. In addition, some of his cultural anthropological observations/definitions are just wrong.If you are going to be going on the JET program to Japan, this is a starting point, but only that.If you are going to read no other book about Japan, it's probably not the best one you could choose. I'd recommend Views of Mt. Fujii, Songs of Mariko, Memoirs of a Geisha, Tale of Genji, Turning Japanese or even Dave Barry Does Japan."
1,"Was not the product I ordered, was sent lesser quality product than advertised.","Instead of the heavy duty version Fram oil filter I ordered from your company and Amazon, I recieved the lowest quality Fram filter you offer. Thanks for the crappy oil filter I was trying to avoid purchasing. Now I have to use it being I cannot wait another week for a replacement. Filter number PH6349A is not the filter number I paid for, this is a orange standard filter and not the premium black filter made directly for synthetic oils. Again, thanks for the false advertisement, hope people don't trust you guys as I did to keep your end of the deal and to not waste valuable time and money."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Thought that I would enjoy this period piece, but it was too vulgar for my taste. I love mysteries enough that I watched the whole thing. It reminded me of a play since I didn't think that most of the acting was very good as compared to Downton Abbey or Our Mutual Friend. I also figured out the ending about halfway through. The part that disturbed me the most was when the supposed murderess ridiculed the man of God and God himself. How rude. If she would be someone who believed in God and in morals, she wouldn't have been in the situation in the first place. I did enjoy the acting of the stepson and wonder what else he acted in. Didn't quite enjoy the part of the ending since people took the law into their own hands. Isn't that what got everyone into the predicament in the first place...everybody just doing whatever they felt like with no qualms about what's right and honorable? I decided that I enjoy refined Victorian mysteries, not amoral, vulgar characters."
1,"Went south, pretty fast - and caused a fuse to trip - 2x.","After a few months of use I noticed it would not charge blackberry. I had to position the phone just so in order for the plug to make contact and allow recharging. A week or two later it caused a short circuit in my car and blew out a 15 amp fuse that protects the car's radio, electrical port, rear view window adjuster, etc). I replaced the fuse; nothing happened when I plugged in my Garmin GPS's adapter, but when I substituted the Garmin adapter with the Just Wireless adapter and rotated the adapter's head downward, it blew out the fuse again. I'd complain to the maker but can't seem to find their address anywhere. Way to go, Just Wireless!"
5,Much more than a garden book,"It's really about experiencing and analyzing the spacial environment. Well written & illustrated. I've used it as a supplemental text in a history of L.A. course, & students have found it really valuable. I've just plain enjoyed it."
4,"Not her best, but very good like just about every other CD","As a big fan of Keiko Matsui, I feel like you could put together any 10-12 songs of hers onto a CD and it will be a wonderful listen. This CD is another good one in that mold, a pleasant listen all the way through.The title cut is terrific, including the solo near the end. ""Postponed Summer"" is another that stands out, although very little does all by itself - this CD is just a good listen all the way through with consistently good material.If you're a fan of hers, or of good piano music, this CD is a worthy addition to your collection."
3,Ok but not great.,"The style of this doesn't appeal to me as much as her Deep Blue album, but its not bad. There are some tracks that are quiet to my liking. But most tracks are more upbeat and/or electronic for my tastes."
5,Excellent Product: Say goodbye to those cheap throwaway brushes!,"For many years, I have been using cheap basting brushes for such tasks as basting, barbeque, and other cooking tasks that require a brush. Frankly, I was hesitant to spend the money on this brush because I thought it was expensive compared to the old brushes, which sell for about $6 for a box of 20.Well, I sure am glad I took the chance. The quality of this, and other, La Creuset silicon brushes and spatulas is excellent. I use this one mainly for barbeque, and the wife uses it for cooking as well. We love it. It spreads sauce evenly, the 'bristles' are soft, and it just works great. There isn't an easy way to speak elegantly about a barbeque basting brush, so it will have to suffice to say that all of our kitchen utensils are being replaced with La Creuset silicon if it's available.Buy one of these and a silicon spatula. You will be thrilled with how well they work and how easily they clean up."
3,Good for the Price..But.....,"I bought this watch for swimming only. For the price of $13.50 it works well. My cons on this watch is it runs small and is not very comfortable for long term wear. I have a size 7 inch wrist and it just fit. The velcro is very scratchy. Maybe with time, it will losen up and become more comfortable. I have not noticed it being or looking dirty."
4,Good for price,"I bought this watch for my 7 year old daughter. She wears it eevrywhere and for everything. It ""takes a licking and keeps on ticking""I especially like the band.Con: An apparent battery malfunction straight out of the box. The screen kept coming on and going off. ANyway it seems it sorted itself out."
2,"No English Dubs, just Subs",I Just got the movie today and the movie is just in its original language. There is no English Dub on the copy that I have.....
3,"outstanding formula, not best tasting","I really love Wellness and really want my cats to eat it, but with the exception of two flavors of the regular wet food, they just do not like it. When one of my cats was a kitten, she loved the Wellness kitten formula, but that was it. I can't get either of them to touch CORE canned or dry food, even with their old food mixed. This has resulted in a number of returns, which really made me appreciate the company's guaranteed satisfaction promise! I'm trying to narrow it down, but I think they both don't like either the smell or taste of potatoes, rosemary extract, or cranberries. Obviously, every cat has their own taste preferences just like us humans, but I just wanted to caution other owners to try a sample before buying a large, expensive supply..."
3,Not for my cats,While my cats love some other product from Wellness they are not a big fan for this one. They barely touch it and will always leave a lot to waist.
2,"Good food, bad flavor","The cats loved the other flavor, they won't touch this one. My bad, I ordered the wrong one. Love my cats"
1,Cats did not like,I have four cats and none of them ate this food. I ended up letting the racoons eat it at night. All cats are different where there eating habits are concerned. But none of mine would touch it. They smelled it and walked away. It sat on the floor a week before I gave it all to the racoons.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"0 stars if I could!Do your research before you buy! I thought this food was the BEST for my spoiled cat- but after a complete urinary blockage in my cat, costing him almost his life and me out $900.00 at the vet- the food was determined to be the culprit. If you google this food and ""Urinary Blockage"", ect in the same line- you will find an ENOURMOUS amount of people who went through the same thing with there feline pal after giving this food.SHAME ON WELLNESS!!!"
2,"Wellness CORE Grain-Free, Fish and Fowl Adult Cat and Kitten Food, 2-Pound Bag","Well, I tried this because I wanted my cat to eat more healthy. He is used to Fancy Feast and Friskies. He is a male, 13 yrs old. When he smelled it he started to seem reluctant, like ""what the heck is this?"" Then he decided to try it. He ate a little and walked away. Just enough to vomit it back up on my carpet. It came up just like it went down, in little balls. I don't know what the problem is, but he definitely won't eat it. I will try to mix it with some wet food, hopefully he will eat it."
3,"Its okay, I guess",I like using this brand because its very healthy and my cat's furis GORGEOUS but she doesn't like it and I have to mix it with other brands to get her to eat it.
5,Kitty likes it,"After the vet told me my 8 month old kitten was getting a ""pouch"" I cut back on his food a little. Johnny turned into a cat who ate when hungry to one who was constantly crying and begging for food. I choose this brand for the quality of the food, but my kitty seems to love everything about it. I'm still mixing it in with his other food but he hasn't cried at all since I started feeding him Wellness. This seems to keep him full and happy even when his dinner time is pushed back a few hours."
1,Try a sample first,"Just like other reviewers, my cat also went on a hunger strike rather than eat this food. I DID gradually switch foods and yet when only the Wellness food was left, he would refuse to eat it. He lost over a lb over this whole ordeal. The only way I could get him to eat was to sprinkle some other cat food on top. (Someone randomly gave me some since he knew I had a cat.) What ended up happening for the past month was that the cat would pick around the Wellness pellets and eat everything else. I finally had enough and bought the food he's been eating for the past year (also grain-free, also expensive). He acted like it was Christmas and gobbled down the whole bowl, just like old times.My cat is NOT a finicky eater by the way. He is a stray that we found last year. Up until this purchase, he has eaten everything we set in front of him. Maybe your cat will love this food. Maybe not. Try a sample first because I'm pretty mad about wasting $30."
2,"Great nutrition, but my cat won't eat it.","I really wanted my cat to like this food (especially considering how expensive it is), but she just doesn't want to eat it. I introduced the food to her by mixing it in with her old ""junk food"" dry kibble, as recommended. She simply eats around the Wellness kibble, and I find little bits of it slightly chewed up/spit out by her bowl. I've been testing to see what happens if I don't feed her again until she clears her little bowl of food, but she just mopes around howling (something she normally doesn't do) and starves herself instead of eating the Wellness kibble. What a waste. :("
2,MEOW !!!!!!!,"My indoor cat does not like it, I mix it up with another brand and he would leave the nuggets of the CORE there he does like the smell of it not the taste."
3,Wellness CORE,"My 6 month old male Tuxedo cat likes Wellness Kitten Health Dry Kitten Food, but does not seem to like Wellness CORE. I think he's a ""chicken"" eater. I rate the Wellness Core 3 Stars, as I haven't completely given up yet on mixing it in with other foods he likes: California Natural Chicken and Rice Dry Cat and Kitten Food; Innova Cat and Kitten Food; Premium Edge Dry Cat Food for Kittens; and Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Cat Food, Chicken Recipe. The Wellness plastic bag is one of the nicest kibble, dry cat food bags on the market, featuring a resealable strip, which is a nice feature that some other kibble cat food bags, that are seemingly more paper based, do not have."
5,Simply Awesome,This is a great video. Its very informative and visually interesting. It presents information about art in relation to now in a brilliant fashion. I would give it more stars if I could.
3,"Visually great, but not really informative.","It has a great visual side, but pretty weak plot. No visual trick can rally keep one's attention for 290 minutes. while monotonous voice tells a long boring story asking questions all the time but barely providing digestible answers."
2,Mediocre Minds Opine on the Evolution of Art,"Over ambitious project presents wild conjectures as truth, without proof. Slick exploitation of claims upon subject matter bolstered by sound and fury in place of substance. Intellectually vapid. NOT art history, and only half a step above those well researched revelations splayed on the pages of the National Inquireror. That the filmmakers believe they are performing the equivelant of translating the Rosetta Stone here-with-in is quite evident by the hubris of including their ""Special Features"" section, which consists of the filmmakers talking about setting up certain shots; what kind of a self-important mind could conceive that anyone would want to waste their time watching them relate that their camera crane showed up late one night. Who cares?! I am very disappointed that I wasted my time and money on this immature work of floppy-doodle."
1,Ugh,"""Yes, you heard him. He did say `Seagulls'."" It's statements like these that make this documentary insipidly condescending. The narrator seems to think he can hide his blandness by jerking and nodding his head to every one of his banal syllables. These poor people also seem to think that they can improve a crappy documentary with fancy special effects. Many will no doubt fall for the trick. This kind of thing confirms my feeling that some establishment out there is bent on destroying the world's IQ."
3,Works well until it breaks.,"It is comfortable and fits the violin well, but the first one had the metal ring inside of the rubber foot break within a months of use. They kindly replaced it, but the second one broke as well, in the same place. The metal ring that screws on is broken right through in at least 4 or 5 places."
4,Helpful,"Easy to use but sometimes slips off. But, it's been a helpful support for my little one whose learning to play the violin."
2,Falls off,"The rest is quite comfortable, but tends to fall off the violin easily. As an adult of course I use a 4/4, but I also bought one for my daughter who uses a 1/2. Hers falls off more frequently than mine which is quite disruptive and annoying while practicing."
5,Destined To Become a Classic. . .,"Shot down in hostile Iraq, two US pilots run for their lives. Rescued by a Shi'a Muslim, the three men then fight their way through scorched desert and Saddam's soldiers. So how does a ""war story"" pique a literary reader's interest? Easy. Into A Dying Sun is to war what Lord of the Rings is to jewelry.Into a Dying Sun is triumphant in two ways. One: A lapse in judgment by Biedermann (the main character) starts a calamitous domino effect that in a world where so many of us think we are bulletproof can only serve as a wake-up call. Our actions do have consequences to the people and things around us. Two: Through Sa'ad Abdullah we learn about the Iraqi people and their history. The reader empathizes with a likable Muslim. And since September 11, 2001, America needs all the cultural tolerance it can get.This novel is destined to become a classic."
4,Excellent !!!,"Into A Dying Sun is excellent (could have been longer, but there are no distracting storylines). Overall the author has done an excellent job of relaying the horrors in Saddam's regime and Islamic prejudice and tolerance. A must read, considering we are on the verge of Persian Gulf War II. This is not a book only for war/history buffs, this is a book for everyone."
4,A Solid Introduction to Levinas' Thought,"Dudiak's book is by far one of the best introductions to Levinas available. It does a great job explaining Levinas' philosophy without getting caught up in technical language, and it makes a great effort to situate Levinas' thought within the context of Western philosophy. My only complaint about this book, however, is that it makes little mention of Levinas' Jewish sources. This is important since Levinas himself characterized his thought as addressing the relation between the ""Jew"" and the ""Greek"". A book on Levinas' conception of dialogue should also contain more references to Buber, Rosenzweig, and Buber, who each informed Levinas' ideas on discourse and dialogue."
1,Product misrepresented,"I was interested in purchasing a USB NIKON Cable. This was NOT a Nikon Product, did not even look like the image displayed. [...]"
1,It does not work!,The cable connector on the small end is too loose to make any connection. It does not work with my camera.
1,Junk...Desn't Fit ! Don't buy from here !,I blame Amazon for using a cheap vendor like CableMark. They sell junk. I have a Nikon 880 (baby brother of 990 I use at work. They BOTH use the UC-E1 cable (yes my manual says so too). What I received from CableMark (through Amazon) does NO FIT my camera OR the 990 model at work.First and last time I will shop at Amazon.
2,Too big,This is a great blanket but way too big for all of my daughter's breyer horses. If it was the right size it would be fine.
5,The DVD is Fantastic,"If you loved the VHS version half as much as I did, it is well worth the money to upgrade for better quality and durability. If you haven't seen this version you have missed the most delightful and fun presentation of any Gilbert & Sullivan production. There is so much happening that you will notice new things with each viewing for a long time and will find yourself laughing again and again at all of the fun the cast constantly has with words, music, scenery, props, gestures, etc.. If you are primarily concerned about fidelity to the original book and music, you probably will not appreciate the hint of Elvis at one point and may miss much of the joy throughout this production."
5,Adorable movie.,"This is such a cute movie. My grandchildren loved it especially since it was pirates and ""Mrs. Potts."" A great way to start the introduction of the next level of music to them plus adults enjoy it too."
2,no plot,"I kept waiting for something to happen, but there was just no point. It's boring and outdated; even Kevin Kline was disappointing."
3,The primary reason for non-G&S purists to watch is Linda,"Not being an opera fan, I was still surprised to read in an earlier review that they transposed down considerably for Ronstadt. How much higher can you sing? I love Linda Ronstadt and thought her voice had never been better.First of all, the biggest flaw in this film is the rank amateurish acting by Linda Ronstadt and Rex Smith. As Linda herself has said, she is no actress. And Rex, whoever told him he could sing, anyway? He sounds like an Elvis imitator and a nanny goat when he sings ""Is There Not One Maiden Breast""! Kevin Kline is great. And Angela Lansbury is wonderful. George Rose is just tremendously comical.The sing-song delivery of lines really gets on my nerves.I'd recommend this film for any Linda Ronstadt, Kevin Kline or Angela Lansbury fans."
4,Pirates of Penzance,I recieved my DVD very quickly and it was in excellent condition. I would reccommend this seller.
5,One of our favorite movies!!!,"This is literally one of my family's favorite movies. It's light, campy, funny, and the music is wonderful! It was a delightful way to introduce my children to light opera, and as teens they still enjoy the movie. I would highly recommend it."
3,"The Pirates of Penzance VHS -- (Joseph Papp Production, c 1982)","Every household should own this movie! It's fabulous, funny, clever, and absolutely brilliant! (The DVD doesn't exist, however, so hold onto your video players!) I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the VHS, however. Several times throughout it ""blinked"" (momentarily fuzzy/wiggly), and the left and right edges had a faded, green cast (even on skin tones). I paid about $50 for it (it was available for less but I opted for the higher price thinking I'd get a superior product, 'though maybe they all have these defects). Five stars for the movie itself, but three for the quality of the tape."
3,"My six year old LOVED it as hoped, but -","We rented this from our local library to introduce our kindergartner to Gilbert & Sullivan. Anything with pirates ...The video's quality was bad, and that is why I'm looking for another version right now, as he's requested. If there were some way of bringing this version's audiovisual quality up to par with its performances - which along with the singing are EXCELLENT - this would be the perfect classic rendition of Pirates of Penzance. I hope that somehow happens."
5,Best Gilbert and Sullivan!!!,"I first saw this version as a child when it originally came out and I really am dissappointed that I can't own it yet!!! It is one of my favorite operas and I think the version with Angela Lansbury is the best!!! You would think that with all of these known actors that this film would be on DVD. It has always been a favorite and really helped open the door to music as a child!I absolutely recommend this version above all others...this far excels over the other ""stage"" version especially because it was done with a bigger budget!Please release this on DVD soon!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Fantastic,"We go to every local production of the Pirates but this video is great. We have had the original full Screen version for years, but this one shows the whole vision of the director in such beauty that the old one looks like another show. Buy this one if you like the old one and get ride of the old full screen version."
5,Pleasingly fun,"Pirates of Penzance is a truly special production to be sure. The comical performance by Rex Smith makes up for any poor singing, Linda Ronstadt's graceful tones and beauty adds a gentle touch and Kevin Cline took even my Father by surprise with his athletic movement and deep tones. But I can not possibly leave out the policemen, they did a remarkable job as well and gave the later half of the video the spark it needed.Alright, I will admit my Mother left the room after half to read her emails and my Father was nearly asleep, but neither hurdles stopped me from watching it more than once everyday for over a week until I had to return it to it's anxious owners. Over all, though I'm no expert, I consider it a must see for anyone who simply wants to sit back enjoy a laugh and maybe even sing-a-long."
4,Really funny Pirates,"This presentatain of Pirates of Penzance is absolutely hilarious. I am an octogenarian and my earlier experience of the G & S classic would therefore be old school, possibly, old hat. I actually played Frederick, in public, in 1960.They might not have been 100 per cent faithful to the score and libretto but they were close enough. What blew my mind was the amount and wild quality of the 'stuff'. The sting in the tail was when the Pirates happened upon and took apart a production of another G & S comic opera H. M. S. Pinafore. That was delightfully out of order.If Sir Arthur had seen this version he might have scoffed. Gilbert, I am sure, would have been doing cartwheels. I dropped a star because if they hed been faithful to the score it would not have changed the picture one bit. Really great entertainment and actually great acting."
1,Caveat EMPTOR!!!,"If this DVD IS based on the 'Broadway' production and NOT the 'Hollywood' one........and I suspect it is, based on the 'description'.....you'll be VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!The sound quality is abominable. The lack of 'mobility' on the part of the cameras is atrocious. The sets are disagreeable.I bought it from Hollywood Video, back when it first came out. And immediately returned it to the store as totally unacceptable.I still treasure the VHS tape."
1,Definitely not for G & S purists.,"I have seen the opera staged by three different college or amateur companies, all of which I enjoyed tremendously. This movie was pale and lackluster by comparison. The voices of the actors in this production were just not up to the demands of the score and I found myself turning the volume down to keep from hearing music I love sung like a flat pop ballad."
4,My 3 year old loves this,"My three-year-old son Daniel, who loves pirates, took to this video immediately and has committed to memory a number of the patter songs. Kevin Kline is hilarious and is now Daniel's ideal Pirate King. My six-year-old daughter Charlotte is in love with Mabel (Linda Ronstadt)."
3,Sound levels low on Pirates dub,I enjoyed watching this film again after so many years. Time has not dimmed its appeal although I was disappointed with the sound levels on the DVD. I had to have the volume on my player extended to the max to hear it properly. I appeciate that films of this vintage often do not have digital sound but in the best of all possible worlds it should have been digitally remastered.
4,Well Worth It,"Although purists accquainted with the original Pirates of Penzance will not like this dvd everyone else should. It is great fun with Kevin Kline, Angela Lansbury & George Rose stealing every scene they are in. The acting is broad which is what is called for with Gilbert & Sullivan and the singing is wonderful. Rex Smith does an excellant job as Frederick, and while Linda Ronstadt starts out slow in her interpretation of Mabel, she grows into the role. I did wish for more of the original songs and the staging is uneven. It is a unhappy mix of theater and reality and the mix doesn't work that well. But other than this, the dvd is well worth the price."
5,Where are the Pirates?,"This rendition of Pirates of Penzance with Angela Lansbury has got to be released, it is too good a production to sit idly in some vault someplace. How long must we wait for the DVD to come out?"
5,"Great, great show",this is the first real musical that I have ever watched and I LOVED it. I thought the cast was great. This movie got me hooked on musicals.
5,Finally on DVD!,"I remember watching this movie as a child and loving it then. With everything now on DVD and Blu Ray it wasn't worth buying it on VHS. My entire family pre-ordered this film since it's available on DVD and love it! The quality is wonderful! I was worried that you'd be able to tell that it was a converted VHS, but you can't. I love Kevin Klein as the Pirate King as well as the other characters cast - except maybe Linda Ronstadt since she was in her 40's and looks better than I do in my 20's. Just a great movie!"
2,looks like a dub,"I love this movie, but the quality looks second generation, like it's been copied. The image is not as sharp as it should be. The packaging looks new though, so I can't figure it out."
4,"Long time favorite, but not the complete version","I have been waiting and waiting for this to finally come out. I am thrilled to finally throw out the last of my VHS tapes as it was only sticking around for my Pirates tape, but if you were expecting the rare uncut version with Ruth's Act I pirate scene and Mabel' Sorry Her Lot, you will be disappointed, as I was. I really thought since they were finally putting this together they would make it worth their while and include the full version that is only available via CD with Estelle Parsons plaing Ruth. I guess I'm just annoyed they haven't released the complete version but otherwise still a favorite :)"
5,"A great ""Pirate"" movie for the family","I had this on laser disc, but it was starting to degrade, so bought this to upgrade my collectionof over 700 titles. A fun romp with Kevin and Angela."
5,AWESOME,If you like musicals you will love this. It reminds me of a Mel Brooks comedy. Great for everyone :)
1,"Sadly, not Gilbert and Sullivan","I am a great fan of G&S, and Pirates in particular. Sadly however the most liberal interpretation of the score seems to have been taken with this production. It is thin, tinny, and when compared with CDs from proper stage performances falls far short. The orchestra appears to comprise 4 people who hop from one instrument to another, inserting ""comic"" sounds at various points. The traditional booming Pirate King is a mere shadow, lacking any presence. Some of the narrative passages are well done, and with tongue in cheek humour, but just when you start to feel a bit better about it they reach another song....and you just cringe at the awfulness. Sorry, go and see a good stage production and buy a D'Oyly Carte CD."
3,The Pirates of Penzance,I thought I would enjoy this movie again with my nephew but I was surprised that he turned it down after I got for him since he was in stage production. He was 10 or 11 as far I remember. I guess that was not the case. Life goes on. Oh well. I tried.
1,Pirates of Penzance,This DVD was totally unwatchable. It appeared that it was a negative print - everything was dark and reversed. I will not buy this product again.
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this production. For those who love Gilbert and Sullivan and can't wait to here the beautiful music, forget it. There is no orchestration. The singing isn't too bad, but I love the music so I did not like this at all. There has to be an orchestra, that is a must!!! I don't know how they could even conceive to do a Gilbert and Sullivan Opera and omit one of the most important ingredients. They used amateurs, sorry, Linda, Rex and Kevin. I don't reccommend this at all."
5,From an ex-smoker,"I thought this book was great. The daily exersices helped keep me from smoking again and kept reminding me why I quit. I still have it and anytime I get the urge, I start reading it again."
5,great product,"i found one on a bus stop, must have fallen off a photographers camera. i took it home, glued it around my front door's peephole. since then, i now look forward to and enjoy looking through the peephole when someone bangs on my door."
2,Could not get past the first 50 pages,"Alan Turing and Kurt Godel were two of the greatest mathematical minds of the 20th Century, if not of all time. Not surprisingly, these two brilliant men had more than a few personality quirks. Leven tries to create a novel, not even a historical fiction, really, based on the two men's lives.I could not get past Leven's overwrought prose, and gave up after about 50 pages. The book sounded interesting to me -- I've read and enjoyed Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach, for example -- but after fighting through 50 pages of this book, I am not so sure I like the idea any more. Perhaps a writer like Hofstadter could pull it off, but Leven certainly cannot."
1,Incidents not Narrative,"By Chapter 5, this book was in the trash. I bought it after hearing Levin on the NPR show, On Being. Listen to the radio broasdcast. Forget this book. Levin thinks that by dwelling on one long incident after another she is telling a story. It is if you are schizophrenic! Some may find this type of incidental writing creative. I found it frustrating and fit for the trash."
3,good but not so good,"This is a mostly satisfying book. I like her ""Faulkner like"" style, on the one hand, but it is uneven, and at times rather confusing. Her primary characters, Godel and Turing, are both rather sad cases in many ways, but there were other facets of their lives which could have been at least mentioned, such as Turing's superb running, or Godel's apparently excellent relationship with Einstein... these would not have turned the tide, both men were, it seems, rather tragic in spite of their genius, but it would have added balance to a book which was unbalanced toward the tragic, if not the macabre."
2,I dreamed of one day finishing it,"But I just couldn't! Sorry, Jenna, I just couldn't get into it. I loved the premise, and I'm fascinated with both main characters (as well as the mathematics involved), but I found it far too self-indulgent. I wanted to be a part of it, but I didn't feel Jenna was able to let me in."
3,Minor note about Kindle edition,"There's a curious typesetting glitch in the Kindle edition - doesn't seem to be able to render the ""+"" and ""="" characters; rather, it substitutes some kind of encoding string like [H10011]. At first I thought it was intentional - a Godel encoding! Then I realized it's just a bug in the content. Presumably it's impossible to get this corrected.Other than that, I was disappointed in this book. It's a clever concept - to create a narrative that reads like fiction, but for me, this attempt doesn't work. Reads like gossip.For a much better biography of Godel, read Yourgou'sA World Without Time: The Forgotten Legacy of Godel and Einstein"
4,Truly entertaining,"I can remember those free weekends HBO would allow the cable companies to have every so often. I would go over to my friend's house have some pizza and soda and stay up late watching the free cable. Along with other hopes that pre-teen would see on cable, this was another show I was hoping to feast my eyes upon. Though these shows were a little bit scarier in my youth, the episodes contained here entertained as well as brought back memories from a time all but forgotten. These stories are great to watch with the family around Halloween or to watch while having as few guests over during the summer. Fun for all I say, fun for all!"
2,The bottom of the barrel (at the time),"Weird. After finally finding itself in Season Three, the series pretty much collapses in Season Four. Great casts (and sometimes directors) but consistently stale stories (how many times have we seen the sentient doll tale?) with few thrills. Only Split Personality, with Joe Pesci in full-bore Joe Pesci mode and a lavish gross-out ending, reprises the raw, ballsy spirit of the previous season."
3,"Great show, terrible edition","Any one else notice that the box sets keep getting crappier? This one is the worst...the picture looks terribly grainy; its almost as if it were copied from a VHS. I will say the absence of the Cryptkeeper introductions is an improvement. The puppet used in the previous sets was awful. It looked like the latex on his face rotted off and no one spent the money to fix it. Anyway, best horror show ever, but the DVDs are a terrible tribute to it. Too bad there's no alternative."
5,no longer a secret....,"This book rocks!! Not often do you find a book *actually* worth buying! If you liked ""The Hot Zone"" you will love ""Secret Agents""."
3,Interesting but not great,"I enjoyed this book -- it gives a good overview of many of the viruses facing us, and the issues with our underfunded and ignored health system. I particularly found the chapters on viruses as the root cause of many chronic illnesses to be interesting, and the chapter on West Nile in New York was particularly interesting.I found The Coming Plague to be more gripping, and Virus X to connect more emotionally, so I have to say I prefer those books to this one. At points this book seems a bit too much like a survey (which of course it is), and I found myself wanting to have either more scientific depth or more character depth."
3,new agents out to get you,"When reading this expose I had to remember that Ms. Drexler is a medical reporter researcher, and as such there are areas of her research that may not have been done in depth...otherwise the book is easy reading... The author has much to say regarding new and emerging viruses and bacteria and their ability to penetrate the animal-human barrier. Doctors and researchers are baffled in their attempts to locate the culprits which were in some examples birds spreading germs that jumped to humans. The flaw was Ms Drexler's misses the mark on the origins of the aids virus, choosing instead the old dry tail of the natives ate the green monkey story - ergo, they got the virus. This did not take much work!!! As current evidence shows the problem runs much deeper."
4,Secret Agents: The Menace of Emerging Infections,The book offers a unique and important insight into issues concerning the resurgence of infectious diseases.
1,Handle does not work,The handle was defective and was not telescoping as it said - it was not worth the money at all
4,Very Handy Tool,"Works great in most snow, but be careful using in deep or heavy wet snow as the plastic mount for the handel may crack. This is my second one and this is the only concern."
3,Great for heavy snow,"We had around 5-6 inches and this made my job easy to clear the snow off without worrying about scratching the car (new car). Telescope was a bit difficult to use and the handle came loose from the broom section easily. Because the broom is large - it is BIG, it did not get into close/little areas easily so you need another tool."
5,AWESOME!,These brooms are well built and work great. Lightweight and move a lot of snow! Easy to use and won't scratch the paint as long as you keep them clean.
4,works pretty good,I purchased this for the heavy winter months of Jan/Feb. So far it has worked great. The best part...no scratches on my new car! This was a deal breaker for me and this product has lived up to that. I used brushes in the past on my old car and I'd never go back. ComplaintKing...Recommended.
4,Works great,"It really removes the snow in either direction (push or pull) without scratching the finish, but I wish it felt sturdier when fully extended. I fully extend it and then retract it an inch or two in hopes that makes it a bit sturdier to use."
5,awesome!!! cleared 2 cars in less than 5 minutes!!!,"Snobrum is great!!!I work for an amazon warehouse and kept seeing these in our building. I debated for awhile until I read the reviews. also..this product was something one of my coworkers kept talking about...So I bought two of them...One for me and one for her. We both love these!! I had two cars cleaned off in less than five minutes. It was easier for me to pull the snow towards me to get the cars cleared. For my friend, pushing the snow off worked best. So its a personal preference how you choose to do it. The snobrum was used in approximately 9 inches of snow that had fallen overnight. The snow was heavy and really wet and I still didnt have a problem getting the vehicles cleared. Im really glad I finally bought these. Id recommend this product to anyone who wants to get the job done quick and easy..."
2,snow job,I was very disappointed when I received this item and returned it immediately. The item was poorly made and unsubstantial. The telescoping handle didn't increase the length enough to really be useful.The item was greatly overpriced.
3,"A winter must, but handle fitting can crack","I bought one of these a couple years ago and then promptly bought several more for my family.Pro: It's a very useful tool overall and I can completely clear all the snow off my SUV in minimal time.Con: I've found that the plastic fitting where the telescoping handle screws to lock in place can crack. (3 out of 5 we own are cracked.) If I tighten it less, the telescoping handle sometimes collapses while I'm using it. If I tighten it more, then the plastic cracks. The fitting seems a little light-weight for what is needed - maybe they can switch to a heavier grade of plastic or change it to metal. Because of this fault, I think they're a bit expensive for the quality. I'll use it through at least another winter before I consider replacing mine."
2,not impressed,"overall this worked well due to the sole fact of the retractable handle, half way through the winter the locking mechanism started to fail and the blue foam started to loosen on the red plastic piece"
5,I love this thing,"Works great to push heavy snow off my car. Don't want to scratch my car so I bought one. So happy I did. It's very light weight also, so people that have a hard time lifting can use with ease."
3,Not for all snow conditions...,"I used it on wet heavy snow today, about 4 inches or so thick. It took care of the windshield and hood ok but the roof was another story. I drive a Subaru Outback Wagon and the 4 inch wet snow would not move. I had to get a plastic shovel to get the job done. Also, the tool buckled where the handle connected to the broom and it would not stay locked in the extended position. So don't throw away your old fashioned snow removal devices as this is not the end all 100 percent solution."
5,Had one for a few years now and I love it.,"Found this at a chain auto parts store and figured I'd give it a shot. I've been using it for years; it made cleaning off the tonneau cover of my 2002 Ranger an absolute piece of cake. On a really bad day, it might take me 45 seconds to clear it. I've cleared 8+ inches off my truck quickly by pushing and pulling the snow off with this 'brum.'Since selling the Ranger, I held onto this awesome accessory and now use it on my Blazer.I loved it so much that I bought a similar product for my wife's car. Hers has a threaded collar which allows the handle to telescope - but that takes two hands to operate. This Brum can be operated with a one-handed flick of the wrist with a little practice.You will need to keep a dedicated ice scraper in your car, but the time you save with this brum will more than make up for it."
5,Better than before,"I bought this sno brum to replace the one I received years ago. I got a little careless with my old one and bent the handle. The old one had an aluminum handle, whereas this new one is steel. It's far stronger than the old one and I'm expecting years of use from this new sno brum."
3,needs redesign,"Bought this from Amazon last winter and used it very often. The concept is excellent but it needs to be redesigned to fix a problem with the locking mechanism for the telescoping feature. No matter how much I tighten it, at times, when you try to push or pull heavy snow the lock does not hold and the unit handle either folds or telescopes. Needs a better telescope locking mechanism."
3,Sno Broom,"Good concept, but this product could use some improvements. For example, the handle keeps collapsing when you push off a lot of snow causing it to be difficult to use and shortening one's reach. The head of the broom also tends to pivot, further making it difficult to remove snow from your vehicle. Overall it is not a bad product, but could use some fine tuning to make it a superior product. As is I give it a B- at best."
1,surprised at the good reviews,The head of this brum unscrews way too easily and the shaft is so soft it bends way too easily. good concept but poorly designed.
1,sno brum,"It was so cheaply made it broke the first time I used it. No screws to hold anything together, just some small plastic nubbies - worthless. returned it immediately"
1,JUnk.,Just plain broke in half. Forget it for anything more than 4 inches of snow. What a shame - seemed like the product had potential.
1,Scratches and collapses,"I too am surprised by the number of good reviews. I bought this towards the end of last year's brutal New England winter. It scratched my car - not terribly, but definitely. I think it is due to the rather hard edge around the cushioned area. And the handle repeatedly unlocked. I am throwing this away and looking for something else for this year. I agree with another reviwer who said it is a good idea but very poorly executed."
2,I've used a sno brum for the last ten years or so,Sno brums are great. They're very light so you don't get tired. They push massive amounts of snow. They are fragile but they'll last for years if you use them properly.The worst flaw of the brum is the mechanism that keeps it from collapsing. Some work better than others but mine is very difficult to tighten. I have to constantly retighten and I can feel that it only goes so far and then starts spinning. Spraying with silicone makes it a little better. I'm pretty sure they'd have taken this one back but I bought mine late in the season on line and shipping costs and inconvenience would be ridiculous. I wish they just built this mechanism better so that it worked right on all the brums.
5,It really works!!!,My new Sno Brum is everything I wanted it to be! It is fabulous! Lightweight and so very effective in removing snow from my car. My neighbors all tried it and plan to order their own Sno Brums.It is always gratifying to find a product that does what is promised. Thank you!
5,Great Product,"I help an elderly widow with snow. She has a Sno Brum, and I just had to have one! Great product! With it, the car gets cleared off so much faster."
5,Sno brum makes life easier,Just bought the sno brum and love it. We just had 17.5 inches of snow in Wisconsin and it worked great. This is the only product I could find to remove snow from a vehicle. I would admit you can't use a lot of force when you using it otherwise it could break. Great product.
5,Perfect for Removing Snow,"A repair shop told me about the Sno Brum. They use it for all their outside vehicles. It does a good job of removing snow, while not damaging the paint."
4,"Fast, Efficient, Love it",Great way to get snow off the car with worrying about scratching the finish. Simply push the snow off. Takes off large amount of snow at once without having to go over the same spot over and over again. Love it.
2,SnoBrum weakness,I purchased three SnoBrum's in December. I had seen one that my cousin purchased last year in Maine.Two of the Brum's work great -- one snapped in half when removing light powder snow.My plan is to contact the company for a replacement.
2,Snow rake for autos,"I guess I will see how this works out over the winter. This item seems flimsy, but since I have never had one before maybe they are all similar. What I don't like is the rake portion does not articulate, so if you want it to lay flat you have to remove it from the handle. It seems there are others that have this feature, but did not see them until after I purchased this one. From what I can see there might be better options out there."
4,I love my Sno Brum!,"I park my car outside in Maine, and I love that the Sno Brum safely removes snow without scratching my car! The only thing I don't like about it is that the extending handle collapses into itself sometimes. Otherwise, I love this product!"
4,Snow Brum,I love my snow brum. It is very helpful when I am trying to remove snow off the roof of my SUV. I can get the job done in half the time.
5,Works With Longer Poles Too!,This is as good as advertised for a car and I've used it for that and will keep it in the car. But for me the good news is the threads in the snow brum head and handle are the same as with household poles for extending roller brushes or attaching mops. I really wanted the snow brum to clear the snow off a large hot tub cover and was able to quickly attach the heat to a 10' extension pole. The handle that comes with it won't quite reach all the way across the cover.
5,"light weight, but sturdy","I bought two of these, one to sweep the snow off of the hot tub cover, and the other to sweep it off of the cars. I just stuck a couple nails in the shed to act as a holder, and it's there when I need it. Works just as needed."
4,Good Brum,"It is great but the handle keeps unscrewing from pole when you use it.It does take off the snow, but for some reason the brum part comes loose"
5,Cleaning the truck off just got easy,Makes cleaning snow of my F150 a breeze. Simply push the snow off the truck and go. Telescoping handle means I stay clean and dont need to open the warm cab to stand and get top of cab cleaned off. Also useful for clearing the snow of my bed cover.
4,Snow Brum,Bought to remove snow from Solar Panels and works great. Would recommend for my use or use to remove snow from roof.
4,Works as advertised.,"Living in Colorado we get our fair shair of heavy snowfalls. This is definately easier to use than our old brush and makes quick work of clearing the car of snow. The only thing I would change is I wish the head folded up for storage, it's a litte cumbersome in my closet and doesn't stay standing."
5,Sno Brum,"The Sno Brums are great! This is my second one. After 3 years of use, I gave my old Brum to my son."
5,Must Have!,"I live near Buffalo NY and this is a staple! I'm here to tell you that you can move some snow! I have an SUV and this works so great at pushing the large amounts of snow. We just got 12"" last night, and this Brum cleaned my truck in about 2 minutes. If your on the fence, please just buy this!"
1,not so useful,"not good for snow more than 6 inches. the first time I use, the handle broke. Not strong for BIG snow."
1,Didn't work,"I was never able to get this to extend and that was a real pain, especially since I bought it for my wife, who is short and catch reach the top of the van. Also, don't mistake this for an ice scraper; it has rounded edges meant to remove snow without scratching the roof of your vehicle."
2,Opinon of Sno Brum,I used the Sno Brum for the first time after the storm of 2010 in New England.I had purchased two of these. It was not very good to use because the head of the Sno Burm kept coming undone and I had to stopped and twist it back on. I would not recommend this to any of my friends. I am very disappointed in this product.
4,To short,The handle isn't long enough for me to reach across my Jeep Liberty. Why not add another foot to the length?
4,I thought the product was for a roof of a house must read more carefully,"This product can be used for a roof, however, I have to buy a longer pole. and ensure the top of the pole will fit... waiting for snow and purchase of pole.."
2,JUNK,Looks like rubber...but it's actually lined with Styrofoam!!! The stuff that disposable coolers a made of. Or package material that you throw away! I hope I never have to use it!
5,Two of Tona La Negra's classics on one CD.,"Most of the songs on this CD made Tona La Negra a peerless and immortal bolero singer. The two albums contained here were among her most popular RCA recordings and make for sheer listening pleasure. Once you fall under Tona La Negra's spell, you'll want to get all her work. (By all means choose the originals on RCA over the remakes on Orfeon, WEA Latina and other labels, however.)"
1,Very disappointed,I just recd this book & there is not one project in it that I will make. I have already put in with other books to be sold in a yard sale. I need colors I like to be shown in the quilt in order for me to decide to make it. The colors in this book are dark; without any sparkle. The quilt on the cover is the only one I half way liked but I have other books I can refer to for the pattern.
1,Not what I expected,I only like one of the patterns on this book. The cost of the book greatly exceeded what I found inside. I wished I had listen to the one review telling me not to purchase it. I did not find anything really innovative or different.
4,#20-- and a slight dip in quality....,"Hamilton's Matt Helm books are always a good value, and I've read the first 20, in order. This is my least favorite, though it's still good. An element of silly paranormalism creeps in here, and it's unwelcome in such a gritty, realistic series. Yes, Matt kills and connives and screws as usual, and it's, as always, well written and well-plotted, but there's a bit of suspension of disbelief necessitated here that's never been required before. I'll read the last 7 in the series, hoping this is a bump in the road."
4,Alright....,"This book is excelent if your interested in the current argument about CAS (Whether the A-10 or other, faster planes are better). If you are looking for this book because you like the A-10, you may be satisfied with its full page color photos, but the author is constantly denouncing the A-10 throughout the book. If your for the F-16, this is a great book. The author gives countless examples to support his opinion, and they had me half convinced. This book is also nice because it glorifies some of the older CAS planes, such as the A-37 and the A-7. Overall, I would recomend this book to anyone interested in CAS,"
2,If you have the motorola 2267 phone move on to another case,"I have a Motorola V2267 series cell phone, and according to this page here it says this leather case in compatiable. It took 30 minutes to squeeze this phone into the case. If you have a faceplate, take it off. The ear hole and the mouth hole do NOT line up with the phone. Only buy if you have the patience to fit this phone into the case..."
5,great product,"We couldn't find what we were looking for anywhere else, but we found it at Amazon. And it was at a great price, and came delivered as promised. We got exactly what we ordered."
1,broken when arrived,"One of the plastic tabs holding a strap was broken. So, my son couldn't even use it. But he is an average size 9 yr old and the backpack was too small. It doesn't hold much either. IN addition, the part that holds the skateboard is designed only to hold the skateboard. So, if you are not carrying the skateboard it can't hold anything else. I would not recommend buying this product."
5,An unexpected pleasure,"I was ready to be really impatient with this book because of the ""minor characters"" who tell the story. I ended up really loving it. Storm does a great job writing about characters falling in love (although her idea of what happens after that can be a bit bleak). My only complaint is that these characters are pretty much dropped from the remaining books, which focus again on Cal and Pell. That's really where the heart of her stories are, but it was a little disconcerting to lose track of Lor and Flick in the next books. (P.S. I have to say that the person writing the Publishers Weekly review commenting that Cal is a minor character needs to be the subject of a very dark Grissecon.)"
3,Worth the wait?,"Being a huge fan of BlacknBlue since they released their self titled debut,I have been looking forward to this release for at least 7 years, once I heard they were getting the band back together.Upon my initial spin of their latest cd,I was longing for that classic BnB sound,which,from time to time,shows up on this cd. I was somewhat disappointed at first,so I gave it another chance...,same result. It's not that it's that bad,it's just not that good,especially with 3 of the tracks totaling almost 3 minutes,combined.If you need this cd to complete your BnB library,pick it up,but if you're longing to hear the BnB of old,go back and listen to ""Without Love"",""In Heat"",or ""Nasty Nasty"". Better yet,just get ""The Ultimate Collection""."
2,Disappointing,"Compared to Black 'N Blue's other albums, this one just doesn't quite seem to hold up. Their classic sound is missing and the songs sound mostly uninspired. I suspect it's because their original lead guitarist and co-writer, Tommy Thayer, is not on this album. 80s hard rock fans might like this album as it does have it's moments with prominent songs like ""Fools Bleed"", ""Hail Hail"", and ""World Goes Round"", but true Black 'N Blue fans will likely remain dissatisfied and know that this album could've and should've been better."
3,Paul Stanley's brother?,"We want Kiss, We want Black n blue, We want Kiss, we want black n blue.If we went into this bands influences and record collection( particularly the singer), it will be Kiss, Kiss and Kiss. As a youngster, he may have dressed like him, acted like him and most definitely sounds like Paul Stanley and Kiss in many ways."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Black N' Blue were one of those ""2nd Tier' Hair Metal acts from the 80s....a band that was just as good and talented as the top-shelf acts but for whatever reason weren't that successful. So, it is to my shock and awe that they actually have a new album out. And, just like as in the 80's, this material blows away the more well-known and bigger selling acts!There are only three or four throwaway tracks on this platter - everything else is pretty good. This DEFINILTEY blows away new releases from Bon Jovi and Def Leppard, that's for sure!"
3,"Works great, but really small","The lubrication oil works great with my electric shaver. It helps clean as well as sharpen the blades on the razor. I normally use this product every 2-3 shaves to increase the life span of my razor blades and not have to replace them as often. The size of this bottle is really small and I will be going with a little bigger of a bottle to last me longer. The price isn't the best, but I needed to find something quickly to travel with and settled on this."
3,dont know,Sorry I've not had an opportunity to use this product yet. But it did arrive on time and without problems.
3,All is just fine,Asking reviews for items that are pretty standard is pretty dumb.Oil is oil is oil. It works as oil and it was received as expected
5,Nichole,"I have had this album for several months and, although my primary music genre to listen to or purchase is usually heavy metal, this is so fabulous that I have to say so! BUY THIS RECORD . . . you won't be disappointed!!"
4,Nicole,"Very smooth and relaxing much like conventional ""New Age"" music. Nicole hase a very unique style to her flute playing that sets her apart from others. She sounds just as good in person. The only downside is ""sameness"" of the songs. I would definitely buy another one of her albums."
5,Entrancing and Hauntingly Beautiful,"I've had this CD since January 2005, purchased at the Denver Indian Market after hearing Brule for the first time. In August of same year I was injured in a car accident, and this music was my initial therapy. For several months after, it was played for me repeatedly every night to enable me to relax and get some sleep. In the listening I was transported from my broken, dispirited state to another time, another place. I'm quite sure that without it my recovery would have taken considerably longer. I still listen to the CD frequently; it is so uplifting... thank you, Nicole and Brule!!"
5,Unexpected,Passion Spirt as well as Brule's music are the most relaxing and spirtually uplifting CD's I own. When I first saw Brule live Nicole wasn't with them. I wasn't entirely sure how a flute would fit into Native American music. Nicole has done a wonderful job of giving a new life to this music.
3,Mark wahlberg collection,"If you are a die hard fan of Mark Wahlberg and you want to put this DVD with your collection go for it, but I think the price is high considering the interview with Mark is about short like 15 mintues."
1,Bulwer-Lytton reicarnated!,"I have not read such long, involved and confusing sentences since I tried to read ""The Last Days of Pompeii."" Here is an example of the first two sentence of the book: ""Bad thing were starting to happen again in Uncle Henry's basement. These were things that had happened before, when the wind swung round, when the trees all felt the blood rush to their leaves after the exertion of August and the idling of September; when the chuckle-dark harvest moon shaped pumpkins in its own image, brought its secret wine flush to the scarcrows' cheeks; when the rich bounties of the land lay plump for the taking and the light left them alone for longer and longer at a time."" The entire book is written in this manner. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Dragonfly Is Awesome!,"I recieved an autographed copy of Dragonfly by Frederic S. Durbin for my 13th birthday from an aunt. I have read it many times since. This book is awesome for anyone who enjoys an adventure with a twist of fantasy. There is the usual plot: Girl trying to save world, then the love story, heroes, adventure, friends, enemies, strangers, mysterious gypsies and more.... I totally advise anyone to read this great book!"
2,Kinda disappointed,"I bought this movie because I remembered seeing it at the age of six when it first came out. The message I got from it then was that if there was a war, I could use that as an opportunity to kill all the people I hated. Not a very good lesson for a six year old kid.Some are touched by the heroism of the main character, and yes, one could say he was heroic, but what is heroic about a tough little guy full of anger?The stars. Why two stars? The story was pretty skinny, I mean, not much substance, not much history told. I really was expecting more.The price is way beyond what it was worth to me."
5,GREAT BURN ON DEMAND SYSTEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought this season was delightful.The artwork looks professional.The discs don't look like their dvd-r.The only thing that looks unprofessional is the back cover it shows a picture of rj and then on the bottom has a synopsis and a list of episodes.One other thing i thought this set wouldn't have was special features.Overall,I thought this set was very well done artwork, menus, and show is great."
4,HILARIOUS,"Great show. Pretty raunchy, but HELLA funny! RJ is such a like-able character. You're rooting for him the whole time. He has a sweet heart and he's a good guy. Lily is hilarious and Miles is disgusting, but hilarious. I was really unsure when I saw the previews for this, but it's really funny. Quirky, but awesome. (Then again, I am in college so maybe it's just my age group) LOL."
3,Got it because it was free,"I got this episode through a free promotion. The video quality was okay, but I would not pay full price for each episode."
5,skipper,"I ordered this toy for my daughter who loves to jump rope. She LOVES it & can't wait until it warms up so she has more space to play with it outside. It takes the place of my old ""lemon twist."""
3,"Great musicians, classic songs, - mediocre documentary","I grew up on Cream. And when I saw this available I though ""Wow and in-depth explanation"". At worst we will get some good songs. They are not just old memories to me as I still keep copies of their songs on the iPhone.What we got was a lot of disjointed sound bites. The information was interesting though maybe not new to most people. However it was fun listening to everyone including Clapton, Baker and Bruce reminiscing with a few sound snippets tossed in. This presentation would bat a good add-on to a DVD but just is not that great as a standalone presentation.Disraeli Gears [Vinyl]"
2,A definate thumbs down,I don't know who's idea it was to take these poor films and put them into a tin can collection. I am kicking myself for buying it. Maybe I can pan it off at a flea market or something. It comes in a nice package. That is the best I can say about it.
3,attache case fell apart as I took it out of the box,the handle of the case fell apart as I took it out of the box. The pieces of the games worked well. Good that it is magnetic.
3,"Functionally the same, but not as pictured","I ordered this and it's not as pictured, although it fulfills the same need. It doesn't have the little ""nub handle"" like thing shown in the picture. It is two flat pieces that screw onto both ends to protect your filter stack."
1,Way To Short,"This game may look good on the cover, but it can be finished within 2-3 hours. Graphics are not realistic, neither are the sound effects. The battle parts are 'okay' but not at all realistic. I was very disappointed with it. Return of the King GBA game is a much better use of money. It's cheaper too.It has many ""chapters"" that are not in either the book, or the movie (both of which I enjoy). I traded this game in for The Third Age, which is an awesome game. Save your money, get Return of the King."
2,"It is fun,but it is scary.","At first,I was stuck on level 3.Then my friend got me to level 6.To get past level 6 you have to stay with the tiny rocks.If you do not,Edmund will lose energy.Anyway,yestrday I got to level 9 and I got caught by the guard.Since I was too scared too go on,I shut my Game Boy off.Although it is scary,it is fun.If you like scary stuff,I recommend this game.If you don't like scary stuff,find a different game."
2,It is fun but it is scary.,"First,I could not get past level 3.Then my friend got me to level 6 and when I got to level 9,I was not happy.A guard caught me and I turned my Game Boy off because I was too scared to go on.I am 9 years old but if you like scary stuff,I recommend this game."
5,Very dramatic Prokofievs 3rd!,"This sonata by Sergei Prokofiev is not very often recorded! Even though we do hear some audio flaws, being a live performance, this dramatic interpretation of such a technically-demanding piece deserves great applause and deserving admiration by the talented pianist."
3,Disturbing portrait of a Dysfunctional Family,This film is very disturbing about a teenage boy forced to have intercourse with his mother. Ryan Phillipe gives a wonderful and frightening performance as Jimmy West. His pain and anguish are perfectly shown from Ryan. You feel sorry for him and can't believe what his father has forced him to do. The film however is very slow paced and half way through the film Jimmy West leaves and the rest of the film focuses on his father and mother played by John Savage and Natassia Kinski. Nothing really gets resolved in the end and has an unsatisfying ending. However I do recommend this film for the wonderful performance from Ryan Phillippe.
1,mislead,"I bought this title because it was listed under gay movies. We enjoy watching movies about gay people with gay people in them. This movie had nothing gay about it, and was totaly misrepresented. A total waste of money."
3,"Disturbing, but worth it","My roommate rented this movie last night and I had no idea what it was about when I sat down to watch it. As the story unfolded, I was totally horrified by the forced incestuous relationship between mother and son. I quickly guessed (correctly) that they were going to lead us to believe Ryan Phillipe was the father of the 2 boys (both of whom are fine young actors with bright futures). I really hated this movie at first, not wanting to witness such a disturbing scenario, but after it was over and I had time to digest it all, I realized how well done it was. This movie was definitely saved by its superb acting."
2,All in the Family,"This mildly engaging indie drama presents an intriguing mood and a couple of good performances, still as a whole it doesn`t work very well. Antonio Tibaldi directs this story about a dysfunctional family and its secrets, particularly Jimmy`s past, AKA ""Little Boy Blue"" (played by Ryan Phillippe). Despite the mysterious tone of the film, which offers some surprises along the way, this is an average effort overall, since the pacing is too slow at parts and the ending isn`t too satisfying. The acting is convincing, though (John Savage, Natassja Kinski), so this offbeat coming-of-age tale still deserves a watch.Not bad but not good enough either."
4,"noooooo, my brothers are my sons damnit","shocking and powerful piece. Phillippe is the son of Nastassja Kinski and John Savage(who is Savage in this movie). Savage is Phillippes abusive father. starts good and ends with a bang, well two bangs. and one of the bangs shouldnt of been in there, where Kinski gets shot. the story goes that Savage stold Phillippe when he was a baby and killed his real father and raped his real mother, his real mother finds this out and comes for some, well, revenge. Phillippe also finds out that his brothers are his sons and his mother is the one who he had sex with, whoa!!!! and then Phillippe suddenly vanishes. his real mom comes and kills Savage and then Kinski(whyyy!!!) and then shes shot down by Phillippes buddy cop. they find Phillippe under ground tied up from his fake father. Phillippe delivers one of his best."
1,watch The Reflecting Skin instead,"What, have Antonio Tibaldi and Michael Boston just rented Philip Ridley's ""The Reflecting Skin""? This movie watches like a V.C. Andrews' book directed by a film 1 student. Kids: Ryan Physique, I mean Phillippe, plus taboo subject do not a great movie make."
4,Little Boy Blue,This is an awesome soundtrack. It is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do. this is odd why is amazon putting the soundtrack review in the movie review? just to let people know so they don't get confused i'm reviewing the soundtrack and not the movie. i will review the movie later when i've seen it.
3,Life often tends to be a lot of heartache,If your looking for any one story about one possible scenario and you don't mind the depressing reality of it this is for you! It is possibly one out of thousands that are unfortunate but true after all there's nothing wrong with our world but the people in it!!!
5,Movie-Little Boy Blue,This movie / DVD is very interesting Indeed. It keeps your attention and is quite the story to say the least.
2,Little Boy Blue,The movie was not good at all. I was very disappointed. Only got the movie because it had Ryan Philippe and only continued to watch the movie because he was naked in it. The movie was disturbing in its theme. Again ryan's bare ass kept me watching.
4,Fantasy Films in Collectable Tin,"This is an excellent value of four of the better made for TV Hallmark movies. All four have good casting, sets, effects, and music. I recommend this set for the whole family. The DVDs are have good quality picture and sound. If you enjoy these be sure to catchMerlin: The Complete First Season.CA Luster"
3,Prefiero los otros albumes de Fobia,"Fobia es un grupo favorito miyo, pero creo que los albumes ""Fobia"", ""Leche,"" y ""Mundo feliz"" demonstran mas creatividad. ""Amor chiquito"" no tiene esa chispa de locura y originalidad que me fascinaba de los otros albumes."
3,Great Illustrated Classics Series Same ISBN# on each Book,"I just realized that at least 3 books from this series have the same ISBN#. Treasure Island, Little Women & The Three Musketeers. Rather confusing if you are trying to complete the set."
2,Kind of weak!!,"If you are looking for a Shaolin movie with good fights, then this is not the movie for you. The reason I completed this movie was because there was nothing else to watch on TV. I fast forwarded through most of it. I was under the impression that most Shaolin movies would have some good fights and training...unfortunately this was not the case here."
3,Shaolin revenge story.,"A young man taken in by shaolin temple as a favor of his father is forced into a journey of revenge after his father is killed by a past enemy. Can he find and beat this man, and is there more to the story then he may think? Another Shoalin flic with some shaolin mastery."
2,Shaolin...enough said,For any Shaolin enthusiast...You really can't go wrong. Not as visually stunning as some other Shaolin movies and lacking in serious training scences...none the less viewable for all Shaolin fans
1,Do not touch...even with gloves!,"Who in the hell okayed this piece of dung to be made let alone be put on dvd? Under no circumstances should this be viewed by anyone for any reason if you have anything else watch it! A kung fu movie should always be about kung fu not about ghosts, exorcisms, or people getting possessed twice. A kung fu movie starts with one story and everything in that story centers on one point. This movie is confusing and boring. The action is substandard, the main hero started out as and remained throughout the whole movie a chump, nobody showed any real skills, and the final battle was too short! Leave this $#!T alone!!!"
1,Extremely weak!,Shaolin Disciple is a horrible movie. It starts off with Ku Feng getting broken out of prison. He was helped out by a masked man who wants him to kill someone for him. Ku Feng agrees to kill the person and does. Then this kid has to take revenge.Now the story does not make a whole lot of sense and has too many long non action scenes that will make you wonder why the hell you are watching this. The star of the movie is the same hero from 'Dragon Claws' and the dreadful '36 Crazy Fists'. Sadly the bad guy in the movie looks super weak and just doesn't look like a bad guy at all. He is small and doesn't look like he could possibly be a mean guy but he does fight decently. And the final fight is absolute crap. Ku Feng actually has the best 2 fights of the movie and that shouldn't have happened. HORRIBLE movie.Version from Tai Seng has very bad picture quality. The graininess is as bad as it gets but does clear up a bit by the end. I also had to turn the volume up extremely loud.
4,"We are all at times Embarrassed Belivers, but ...","This is a very good book. It not only points out where we blow it in sharing the gospel with others, but gives great pointers on how to work through these problems. The book was recommended by my pastor and I recommend it to all."
1,Bold as a Lyin',"Hugh Hewitt provides just what contemporary Christians need: cover.While an increasing number of honest Christians find themselves compelled to admit their claim to truth is every bit as unsubstantiated as the religions they denigrate as false, Hewitt allows other Christians of the twenty-first century to boldy proclaim they don't really care about truth; rather, Christians are free to do all they can do to legitimize the oppression and irrational beliefs they foster.Thank you, Hugh for helping us bury our head in the sand a bit longer, so we can avoid dealing with the real world in the here and now and all the problems thereunto appertaining, not the least of which is the division, terror, and war predicated by unverifiable claims such as the one Hewitt is unembarrased to let us perpetuate.Here's to Armageddon!!"
5,Hewitt Shouldn't Be Embarrassed About This One,"It was a good read. Hewitt doesn't try to spare anyone's feelings during the book, including his own. He hits hard and doesn't pull any punches on the Embarrassed Believers, but delivers a matter of fact lay out. It's not high Christology (you theology majors know what I'm talking about); it doesn't claim to be. But should still challenge even the most seasoned believer. I think the end was a little lacking because it left a lot of questions and provoked thought, but doesn't really give you an answer to the questions it raises...it doesn't even really make a step in the direction of answering questions. However, I would still recommend that you read it. It's worth the small amount of effort you need to get through it and you'll have more than your fair share of food for thought."
4,An Intelligent Plea!!!,"Hugh Hewitt has written a book which is both provocative and challenging to Christian believers in the U.S., who are most likely influenced by what he calls the ""elite media,"" and he urges them to counteract this influence with truth, salt, and light. Not one to merely criticize, he uses his own life as an example, especially in very candid and frank moments of weakness, and he shares these insights with the reader with a great deal of grace.This is an excellent read, and highly recommended for those who want to examine how they can impact their culture for Christ."
5,Love it!,"I love my storage bench! I love the price and the look. I was iffy about buying because previous reviews, but I am glad I went with it."
4,Value for the money as long as you are handy,"Purchased this after reading a number of reviews about the difficulty assembling it. Sure enough, assembly was a frustrating experience. The supplied dowels were 3/8"" in diameter while the pre-drilled holes were 5/8"" in diameter.Assembly is difficult and it definitely requires two people to assemble, but the finished product looks nice.For the price point of $135 it is worth it even with the assembly frustration.When I later told my employee that the bench is supposed to support up to 400lbs, he laughed sarcastically. He said it didn't feel that sturdy and he would guess 200lb capacity max.We will see..."
1,Broken and useless,My bench arrived today. Unfortunately the seat panel was broken in 2 places. I attempted to just fix it and continue with the assembly but the pieces do not line up which makes it impossible to actual build the bench. I am disappointed with the packaging of this product which allowed it to break. I am returning to Amazon for a replacement and hoping to receive a new bench with all the panels intact. I'll update my review if my replacement bench actually gets here unscathed and I am able to put it together without incident.
4,Not bad for the price you pay,Serves the purpose and not a bad price. The craftsmenship is a little sloppy and I had to make some adjustments to make the doors close properly. Looks great and great for putting all my wife's college books inside and out of view.
4,Great bench,"I wanted a small bench to fit in a specific spot, and this one did the job. One of the doors is a little crooked, but it's hardly noticeable. Very sturdy bench, good rich walnut color, and looks expensive."
3,Wood bench with storage,"I put this item together all by myself under an hour. Putting in the doors probably is the hardest part if you work alone. Try to use an extra help for easier assembly. I love the color, love the size, love the entire product. I use it for storing shoes and as a decorative bench in the entryway."
5,Offerings,A beautiful and moving series. The emotion can be felt in every song she plays. I listen to it time and time again and continue to be impressed with her ability to inspire through her music.
2,not a quality product,"I have not been happy with this product. It works sometimes, and sometimes it just freezes up. I have to unplug it to get it going again. Also, vhs tapes get stuck inside, and are difficult to get out. Also, after recording a dvd, you have to finalize it to be able to use it on other brands of dvds. Well, often it will just quit with an error condition in the middle of trying to finalize a dvd. When that happens, you probably just lost everything you had recorded.In my opinion, this is a piece of junk, and the worst product I have ever purchased from panasonic."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I TEND TO LEAN TO PANASONIC PRODUCTS AND I AM SURPRISED AT THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS ONE. IT HAS A MIND OF IT'S OWN. SOMETIMES IT WORKS, SOMETIMS IT DOSEN'T. AND ABOVE ALL DON'T TRY TO PLAY A COMPUTER GENERATED CD CONTAINING E-MAILED PICTURES. YOU MAY SEE SOME YOU MAY SEE ALL YOU MAY SEE NONE. MY $29.00 MAGNAVOX PLAYER CAN PLAY THEN WHY CAN'T THIS ""SOPHISTICATED"" PIECE OF HARDWARE DO IT? IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING."
4,"Good product, but struggling a bit","Bought this for my dad who loves to record TV shows for viewing later. Setup was easy, the quality of recording very good, and dubbing is awesome. What I am not able to figure out is how to create chapters or add more content to the DVD - I wanted to record TV episodes to DVD and since DVD capacity can hold more than one episode, I wanted to add to the existing DVD - unfortunately, the user manual was not very helpful and everytime I tried, it wiped out my original recording. So my dad started recording to tape, and then transfer to DVD (as a workaround). I guess I need to do more research/playing with this. OVerall, it is a good product, and it was a gift he loves."
3,not too shabby,"Makes very good dubs from non-copyrighted tapes to dvd.Instructions aren't precise enough regarding some things-titles and so forth, but the range of dubbing speeds is great, especially flexible recording mode. Wish it would copy some of my store bought vhs but stops when tried."
2,Not too durable?,"I have owned this unit for approximately 9 months. For the first 6 months it worked very well. However, for the past three months we will be watching a dvd or vcr movie and the screen simply goes blank. We can hear the sound, but no picture. In order to get the video back, we have to reboot the system which is a pain in the butt. So far Panasonic has no response."
2,Dissapointed,"This thing works well, if you use Panasonic friendly disks (-r,-rw,-ram). I've been able to record TV shows and replay them just fine. The software does the job, which is really the only perk of this DVD recorder.This DVD recorder burns in some proprietary format, so your disks (-r,-rw) cannot be played on other DVD players (including computer DVD players).The lack of compatibility with other disk types and DVD players makes this DVD Recorder a bust. If there is something else available, go for it. I guess I'll try to unload it on eBay!"
4,Reunion album of original members,"Excellent album with great sound, singer Charlie Huhn on loan from Foghat comes back with a kick a....s hard rock album, I think its much better then there 1980's albums at least sound wise, if your a fan of Charlie or hard rock in general you'll love this album."
4,Great disc from classic era Victory!,This is a great CD from the Don't Get Mad Get Even/Hungry Hearts lineup of Victory. So if you liked those early discs you should like this but w/ better production than the 80's stuff. Mostly heavy songs on this disc and Charlie sounds as great as ever on vocals. Good to see him back though it didn't last after this release.
3,Buy the Kinamax MS-U3266 Mini High Precision USB 3-Button 3D Optical Scroll Wheel Mouse with Retractable Cable instead,"I bought this mouse and the Kinamax MS-U3266 Mini High Precision USB 3-Button 3D Optical Scroll Wheel Mouse at the same time as they were both 5.99 and I needed a small mouse for my laptop...I could not decide which one to get, so I bought both....Unless you need the very smallest mouse you can find buy the Kinamax MS-U3266 Mini High Precision USB 3-Button 3D Optical Scroll Wheel Mouse instead. Both mice work fine, however this mouse is very small and not as well made."
1,Not vista compatible,"I bought this mouse for my new notebook. I open it an plug it in and, to my surprise, it doesn't work. Package says its compatible with windows xp and earlier. The product description mentions nothing about compatibility. Buyer beware."
4,"When they say ""mini,"" they mean it","I thought that this mouse would be a perfect replacement for my recently deceased Targus Mini Kaleidoscope mouse. I liked how Targus had a retractable USB cable and the size of it fit perfectly in my small hand, so the Kinamax looked like a good idea. When it arrived, I laughed out loud at its unbelievable size. BEWARE: The dimensions the seller provides are of the box, not the actual mouse. I'd say the mouse is actually not quite 3"" long and and astounding 1 1/2"" wide. The buttons do make a loud click, but the wheel works very smoothly. Overall, it was a shocking purchase, but you can't go wrong spending less than $5 for an optical mouse."
4,Nice for the price,"This is just what I needed. It's small, cheap and travels well. The only downside - the mouse buttons click rather loud."
3,Smaller than I thought,"I knew it was going to be a small mouse, but I did not know if was going to be this small. A picture that shows size comparison would have been helpful. I love the retractable cable though and as far as functionality, I have no complaints. Great product for the price."
5,LOVE IT,I was very pleased with my order. Shipping was fast and the quality of my item was just as nice as advertised. I will be buying again..
3,Worked for About 2 Years,"Nice compact mouse that works well.Likes:- Retractable cable helps with storage and usability- Fairly high precision (dpi) for the price- Works for both my wife and myself (small vs. large hands)- Price for the featuresDislikes:- Retractable cable seems flimsy--time will tell how durable it is- Not as accurate on shiny surfaces (typical of most optical units)Overall very useful for a Netbook/Notebook.Update: It has been about a year and a half and the mouse is still goingstrong. Retractable cable occasionally binds when retracting, yet is easyto fix by extracting and retracting a couple of times.Final Update: Dropped rating to 3 stars as the mouse died last month (12/2011). You get what you pay for."
2,Not good,I guess you get what you pay. The price of this mouse is cheap. But it really isn't precise when you use this mouse to click on something. It is very hard to control where you aim on the screen. I am surprised that it even has a precision name.
2,Broke within 8 months,The quality of this mouse is not good. We bought two and they both broke within 8 months. The area where the cord connects to the USB piece ripped.
3,Too small,"I did not expect it was such small mouse even after I saw the word ""mini"". It is better include the size in description. Anyway, the quality is good, only the size..."
2,"No Name brand mouse, light plasticy feel, tiny","I don't think this is a kinamax. Arrived in a cheap cardboard box floating with no inner wrapping or padding. Didnt even think it would work, light cheap flimsy, and super super tiny, its a bit awkward to use. it works, and keeping it bc its too much bother to return the $5.99 item, but would not recommend."
5,Very Informative,"There are a lot of great, colorful illustrations that really help you ""see"" the techniques Mr. Seymour is writing about. While much of what he says isn't appropriate to where I live (central Texas), the book is nonetheless informative. It's a great resource."
5,We Should All Be 1/4th John Semour,"The book is everything you could wish to know from beginning to end. The ONLY criticism I have with the book is that is seems to be for one specific climate in England. I'm not quite sure how to translate a lot of it over to a New England (USA)Winter setting. Regardless of that, it's a miracle to have such a book in this day and age."
4,Inspirational,"Well written and inspirational. This book covers the basics of practically everything one would need to know on the subject of self-sufficiency.I rated four stars because I would like to have seen more detail. However, it is worth the purchase price."
3,Missing some vital information,"I am really disappointed with the content of this book. It has beautiful glossy pictures, and a great deal on gardening and livestock - but skips important topics entirely. For gardening, this is the least valuable book that I have ever purchased. I expected this book would include a section on making lotions, but lotions were not covered at all. I use white vinegar extensively for cleaning, preserving, and cooking. The book includes vinegar as a needed ingredient for canning, but it did not go into how to make vinegar - a vital product for self sufficency. I bought a 'how to make vinegar' manual for under $3 from lehman's instead."
2,:(,"I was disapointed with the book. Didn't like the tone of how the book was written. Yes, it has lots of information but the way it is written is hard to read. I use it for a reference once in a while other wise it sits on my self. :("
4,Great Book...,"This book is great for learning and just being able to reference info on ""the old way"" of doing things with modern twists. I have it and bought if for my cousin in Cali whom also loves it. I just wish that it didn't spend time on items that were not really as useful in this aspect. But it is a great book for knowledge about gardening and farming."
5,I love this book!,I love this book! I borrowed it from the library so often that I decided to buy it! It tells you how to do everything!
5,THE Classic!,"This book is an absolute classic in self sufficiency. I don't think anyone seriously considering living ""off the land"" should leave this out of their library. The author not only lives what he teaches in the book but also teaches it in classes. This is a very well balanced book giving little golden nuggets that you probably never considered."
4,I liked it,"Very nice addition to any collection. Most of the ideas and uses, in this book, I agree with. It'll open up all kinds of other ideas to lead a simpler life in harmony with nature and the land we should all be a good steward of."
3,"Good book, but old techniques","Book is an easy resource for self sufficiency, however the techniques are a bit dated. Recommended for traditional gardening techniques and farming, canning etc.Brian Housewert"
4,Terrific; virtually all-encompassing,"This is a great book with great illustrations ... Simple yet detailled, practical yet principled. John Seymour has got a great good grasp of the ecological principles that SHOULD inform gardening and farming (what comes out must go back in).In his other writings, Jonathan Seymour has a streak of anti-urbanism that I don't like--I don't share his view that cities are unnatural, diseased places. But he seems to have overcome it here with a description of urban gardens, limited-scale self-sufficiency and the like. This book lets you pick and choose; if you want to grow wheat on five acres, harrow, harvest, thresh and grind it yourself, that's fine. On the other hand, if you live on a half-acre lot and just want to set up a backyard garden, a compost pile and maybe a beehive, this book will also show you how."
4,Just a bit lacking but amazing info,"There is so much information in this book and it really is great, but at times the author rants a bit and there are parts that are very lacking like the keeping of turkeys. No more than a paragraph and that paragraph really lacks necessary information."
5,Homesteader's delight!,"You won't need any other book to be self sufficient. John Seymour is extremely knowledgeable, mainly from good old fashioned hands on experience. Very common sense, not too wordy, great illustrations. Explains how each farm animal is a valuable contributor to the whole 'stead and works symbiotically with the others. Food storage techniques, some recipes, animal husbandry, wool carding, using a distaff, tools, gardening, etc.. I've bought it as a gift for others. Indespensable and a very pleasant read!"
5,This Book Has Everything!,This Book has everything you need to know about wanting to do things on your own! Great book! highly Recommended for those individuals who want to know how to do things the old way and still live in the NOW. Great Book!
5,Best How to,"This DVD is the BESt DVD by far for how to dj. Awesome interviews and 2nd disc does excellent job of showing you all you need to know about how to dj. Do not waste money on other cheap and cheesy Dj dvds like I did, spend the extra few bucks and I knwo you will be happy with this purchase."
2,Not that great,"better to purchase the Harry James Trumpet Blues CD. It has the better versions of his songs with Helen Forest, including the better version of ""I've heard that song before"". Go figure!"
5,My Mom Loves This CD!,"One day she told me about the big band music of Harry James and wondered it he had a CD and the next moment I was ordering on Amazon. She plays it over and over and was excited it was a 2-CD set. She loves the big band music and on a daily basis you hear it playing through the house while she is doing her household chores so if your mom loves big band music, she will love Harry James."
2,"Nice scenery, at least","In the entire movie live wild boars were seen for a total of about one second. Actually, ONE live boar was seen, plus 3 or 4 dead ones, so those expecting a lot of action will be very disappointed. Mostly it's face time with hunters, and lots of non action as they listen for sounds of their hunting dogs, or boars in the brush.On the plus side, that French countryside is gorgeous, the sportsmen are having a good time, and apparently doing a real service. If I understood it right, those wild pigs are causing so much damage that farming has been largely abandoned in some areas. Doesn't make sense to have a 'season' for the pests.Not worth the $2 rental, but not a complete waste of money."
1,WARNING: Universal does not mean Universal,"According to the manufacturer, this car seat carrier is NOT compatible with thousands of infant car seats on the market despite the clearly misleading name ""Universal"". I bought the top rated infant car seat by Britax and then this carrier based on the box which said compatible with Britax. After reviewing the instructions, I found it was not compatible with this and many other infant car seats."
2,Could not find a compatible carseat,"Pros:-Large, easily accessible basket.-Large cup/snack holder.-Long handle keeps you from kicking the stroller wheels as you walk.Cons:-Most car seats *do not* snap onto the frame including some that are supposedly compatible according to the manual (including my Graco SnugRide, which did not fit).-The only thing left to secure the carseat to the frame is a belt that snaps across the middle of the carseat. If you run into something, the car seat flips upward, pivoting on the strap.I took this to Babies R Us and tried it with all the infant seats, but could not find one that actually snapped onto the cross bar of this stroller frame (tried Evenflo, Combi, Graco SafeSeat). I was disappointed because I do like the design of the stroller and would have kept it if I could find a compatible carseat. I ended up returning this and getting a Graco SnugRider stroller frame instead - not as nice but at least my Graco seat sanps onto it securely."
5,Excellent Product!,"I bought it, and I LOVE this carrier. For the person who hates bulk and complication when wanting to take your baby with you, this item is a MUST!"
3,Infant Car Seat Carrier,"Item not as lightweight and compact as I had hoped it would be. It is universal so I can't expect the car seat to be a perfect fit, but I wish the car seat fit more securely. Serves its purpose though. Not nearly as bulky and heavy as my Graco Travel System. Very easy to push and maneuvers well. Easy one-hand fold up system."
1,didn't work and it was jacked up!,"It says that all Graco SnugRide's would snap into it. Well, ours didn't. I was very disappointed, because I really liked the design. When we got it, the front bar was at an angle, but the pads were just too thick for our carseat. I live in rural AK, and we can't just go down to the store to see it before you buy it, but I would suggest doing that, and making sure that your seat will snap in properly! Other than that, it looked really nice, still waiting for Amazon to refund our money so we can buy the graco brand one. Good luck!"
2,Disappointing compared to their older material,"As a die-hard fan of this band, sorry to say that it never rise to the melodic heights of their earlier albums, particularly Cut. For those who are looking for a sample of this band's best material, look to their earlier 1990s releases."
4,A simple old style kung fu movie,"This is one of the old style classics; simple plot and lots of fighting. Concentrating on the Snake & Crane styles, which are regarded as probably the 2 most difficult to master.The story is your basic revenge plot in a time when your Kung Fu skill defined your power and position in society. It doesn't waste too much time talking in the movie, and gets down to fighting once every 5 mins.The fight scenes are good and numerous. Although if you are a fan of the modern quicker Jet Li in Fist of Legend style you may not like this as much."
1,Not convinced....,"Although Hadler does make sense, I believe he takes too much of a step back & wait approch the could severly damage someone's life. I say this because after reading the book, he also became my rhuematologist. If I had taken his advice & not pushed forward seeming like a crazy person I may not be in remission today. He diagnosed me w/ a rare disease, but only treated me w/ asprin. I later found a doctor who found I had major joint damage, & was risking organ issues. Drastic, quick action has given me my life back...all of which went against the ""last well person."""
4,Great read but........,"The only criticism of this book is that Dr. Hadler's writing style is more suitable for his colleagues, rather than the average reader. It helps to have a good dictionary handy while reading this book."
4,Ignore your doctor but take care of yourself.,"As a practicing physician I approached this book with some skepticism. Even though the reasoning is at time flawed and incomplete the essential message is clear. Physicians in the US have an intrinsic conflict of interest between making a living and healing patients. If interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons actually explained known risks and benefits of their procedures the cardiology ""business"" would collapse. The problem is that would require that the physicians actually understand the risks and benefits- which is rare.Everyone should read this book then ask your physician tough questions about your healthcare."
2,COP SHOT,This was a very difficult book to follow after 45 pages I gave up. It made very little sense. Yes it was a tagedy tyhe Police Officier was shot but the story line really did not justice in my view...
5,A Gut Wrenching Read,"A frustrating story, written like the veteran newspaper writer he was. I worked those streets and knew some of the people. Very true to life in many ways."
4,Very Interesting documentary that makes the familiar feel fresh,"This brief documentary skillfully walks the line between making fun ofand empathizing with 3 Las Vegas performers who impersonate,respectively, Elvis, Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland as part of akitschy show called 'Legends in Concert"".These three individuals are very different in temperament, howseriously they take the gig and what they want out of it.At the center of it all is Johnny Stuart, the fellow who created theshow and who takes himself and his creation very seriously - whilebouncing around as if he were on uppers,The film balances laughter at the absurdity of it all - including fanswho act like these are the real people (even if they have to be'coached' by Johnny to scream more), and sadness at what a strange,hermetically sealed world these people have lost themselves in."
1,A complete disappointment,"The book contaings a whole lot of reading but very little illustration. I do not understand how the author anticipated to convey design, layout and typography by writing about it only. A book like this must be full of illustration. To write about design without illustrating them is an oxymoron. I would definitely not recommend this book for beginners."
5,Excellent Primer on Design,"This book takes you through the basics of the page design process, focusing in each chapter on one of a number of themes such as contrast, repetition and alignment (and several others). I'm not an expert but have designed pages off and on for some years and this book was a breath of fresh and inspirational air. It is clear, useful, has loads of examples and, above all, it had an instant impact on my page designs from CV to web page to software interface to data sheet. Highly recommended. As comparison, I bought another book at the same time on typography, didn't learn a thing about design, and set it aside having suffered pages of historical theory."
3,Thorough But Dated,"The book is ""designed"" for beginners. It is great for brainstorming about - say - crafting a corporate identity using logos, newsletters, business cards, etc. However it is dated. Few pages are in color. The author doesn't assume the reader has access to industry-standard design software like the Adobe Creative Suite, or even to a computer for that matter. The author sometimes suggests the reader use crayons to ""recreate"" various design techniques involving color.But the basics are there, the principles are well explained and the price is right. Skip over the dated stuff and use the book to get a good foundational intro to the world of layout and design."
1,This is the WORST movie in recent memory.,"You would have to be out of your mind to rent this movie. All off the performances are down-right bad- and some are worse. To paraphase Janet Maslin, Claire Danes gives a performance that says: ""Hey,it's a living!"" For the love of God- please don't buy this movie! Your welcome in advance!"
1,0/5,"movie was boring and not funny... having a polish friend, i can probably tell polish people would not be able to relate to this movie0/5 stars to me"
4,lighten up people!,"I just have to laugh at some of you people that bash films like this one. This movie has a terrific heart at its center, and some of you cannot accept that. Lena Olin is, once again, awesome. Ms. Danes is also convincing in her Lolita type role (although she does represent an older version) that their church hilariously selects as the town virgin! Gabriel Byrne has never been funnier and at the same time there are some powerfully poigniant moments too. Relax, world. Movies like this one are not the enemy."
4,Don't be overly critical and you'll enjoy this one.,"Maybe it is because I read so many bad reviews for this movie before I rented it, or maybe it's because I am engaged to a Polish woman, but I really enjoyed this film. Contrary to what the critics said about this movie, I thought it was a well made film. Claire Danes was fantastic, as were the other actors. The only thing that bothered me was the ending. That was just a little too much of Hollywood's emphasis on dramatic endings. I'm not sure I could agree with the claims that this movie is ""hilariously funny"" (Variety), but if you're in a good mood, you should chuckle on occasion and feel good after watching it. From my vantage point (an American observer of Polish tradition), I felt the movie did a good job depicting Polish ways and mannerisms. Of course, my fiancée begs to differ. Sometimes, however, it's difficult to recognise yourself on the big screen. At least that is what I would say to my sweet Polish princess."
4,Funny Movie,I ordered this movie from Amazon after seeing it on Starz. The characters remind me of my relatives. It's sensitive and interesting. I received the DVD promptly after the order date.
2,don't waist your time!,okay...what does a polish wedding have to do with the story? there was no wedding? she (claire danes) was wearing a wedding dress for one scene but she didn't get married. i'm giving 'polish wedding' two stars for one reason only. when gabriel byrnes is crying...that is a VERY good scene and i must say that he is a VERY good actor...the way he was crying and stuff was amazing. but one question. why was claire danes and gabriel byrnes in this terriable movie...i mean they must have read the script. why?
1,The worst movie ever made,"I watched this movie with the hope of seeing a humorous comdey. The blurb on the back spoke of a hilarious film with comedy centered on getting Claire Danes married. I watched the film and I waited for the promised humor. It was gone, never there, the worst film ever to be made was this one. Do not waste your time watching it."
2,Second Worst Movie Ever Made,"I noticed most films are rated 4-5 stars. Its interesting, I think people only want to spend time reviewing movies they liked. Not me- I like to take time to rip films apart that deserve it. Like this one. Sorry-its just dumb. Lena Olin rolls around on a filthy men's room floor and then really gets down and dirty with her boss? OK. Clare Danes gets hit by a priest in public for trying to kiss the Virgin Mary (or whatever) statue? Thats real funny! The biggest disappointment was seeing how big Gabriel Byrne's beer belly is getting. Work out Gabe- you're a good-looking guy. Lose the dorky baker's hat too. Turkey award for this one."
1,Boring and Stereotypical !!!,"This film shows almost every stereotypical form of behavior that has been associated with Poles, albeit Polish immigrants, since the beginning of time. In short, it's neither funny nor entertaining, and it's not groundbreaking in any sense of the word - it's simply pathetic!Don't waste your time or money on a film that has the artistic/intellectual merit of pavement pizza."
1,Pointless,"I have to disagree with the reviewers who say that this movie is offensive to Poles. I don't have an ounce of Polish blood, but I still found it to be a huge insult to my intelligence.The movie was boring, pointless, and painfully unfunny. The filmmakers seem to think that all they have to do to make a movie quirky is to have their actors do stupid or self-destructive things, then follow it with happy circus music.Don't waste your time with this movie."
3,Charming low-key indie,"I grew up in a Polish-American small town, so I recognized some aspects portrayed in this film, set in a Detroit unlike any other Detroit ever portrayed in a movie, i.e., a suburban blue-collar ethnic enclave almost small town in its atmosphere. The mother is improbably beautiful, and her body is way more taut that it would be in reality after delivering the four kids shown in this movie. Never mind. We have some fantasy here. I liked the sweet soundtrack. And the ending is, of course, pure Hollywood. The pace is very slow here, and the father spends almost all his time smoking and thinking and brooding about his cheating wife while his hottie daughter is getting into trouble with a local boy cop."
5,Great Movie,"This was really quite interesting and funny movie. Rich in Polish traditions and sometimes dark comedy, this movie was, if nothing else, entertaining.A Michigan teen (Claire Daines) betrays her parents when she finds that she is pregnant. Her father, a quiet, almost depressed Gabriel Burn, and her mother, a very dramatic Lena Olin struggle in life and everyday problems.It was good and very funny."
3,"""Polish Wedding""",A good laugh. This movie describes the ethnic input into American society very well and we can all have a laugh at the Pole's expense. God help us if our daughters ever get into a mess like this. Enjoy.
2,Forget the Unisom...,"You'll be zonked in no time with this hooder, unless you've downed a pack of no-doze with a bottomless expresso. In that case, be prepared for a weak story and the usual sophomoric, melodramatic, ""I'm the center of it all"" performance by Claire Danes.Lena Olin is the highlight of this film. She adds the flair and talent that saves this movie from being a complete bomb. She's also joins Julie Christie, Goldie Hawn, Tina Turner and Cher in Hollywood's fountain of youth club--she looks fabulous!"
5,Quirky,"I love this movie, though it doesn't seem to have the mass appeal. Plus it was filmed in my area. Great performances by Danes, Byrne & Olin."
1,Too Expensive!!,I was comparing things on Best Buy and other stores. Bestbuy sells this car for $35 and that's sooo cheap. I don't know if one car is bigger. The only difference I see is 2 extra AA Batteries!! Wow was Best Buy right.
1,Don't judge this DVD by the cover!,"If you think ""hey, this looks good"" just by looking at the DVD cover, YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED! This is an extremely low budget B movie. The actors are like zombies and the storyline is pure suckage. I'm not being cruel here- I can't believe I actually paid $1 for this. My dvd player will be mad at me forever now."
1,Waste of time & money,"This is a disgustingly boring movie with D- actors and a ridiculous plot. How can you make zombies out of a vampire bite? and when did zombies start RUNNING after their prey? Compared to '28 days later"" and ""From dusk til dawn 1"", this movie is a joke. I'm being generous with a star. It actually deserves a quarter of a star."
2,WORTHLESS MOVIE-PRICELESS ONE-LINER,"When a sheriff and his deputy rescue three people from a horde of zombies, the sheriff backs the car up to flee when Mikey one of the rescued says, ""Run them over"" and the sheriff says straight-faced, ""You jest cain't run over people, jest cause theys dead."" Other than that the movie pretty much stinks and I always thought when a vampire bites that produces another vampire not a zombie."
5,Pure Entertainment,"Blood, killing vampires with wooden stakes, black bile, cowboys on horses, modern day zombies and defenseless babes...what more could you ask for!!!!!"
3,Not Scary Enough!,"Unfortunately like most horror films getting churned out these days, it eventually succumbs to its own plot failings and any attempts to wrap up the story in a neat little package fail as well.There are few moments of actual scary here - I'm glad I didn't pay 13 bucks in the theater for a few moments of ""uh, yeah I guess that is pretty nuts""."
2,A big let down,"This got a really good score on Rotten Tomatoes. Since really excellent horror movies are few and far between, I was very excited to see it. Sadly it was just disappointing. Sloppy, not very interesting, a few moments of suspense here and there, a few creepy effects, but all in all the continuity isn't great. Found myself anxious for it to finally be over. Not terrible, but not much to recommend. Wait til it streams for free, regret paying to see this. Also, it is from the Phillipines, subtitles are okay with me, but I wasn't aware of them before, if you hate subtitles skip this for sure."
1,"Silly, muddled & ineffective","Well, that about says it all. I am surprised at the sophisticated design of the DVD. Complete waste of money."
3,Weird!,"Three distinct but related stories are told in this unusual horror film. Three young people are lost on a deserted road. Two young women get assistance from a stranger when their car breaks down. A young boy is held captive by an abusive mother. The three parts of the film are all woven together to tell a story. This one can be pretty creepy and is not for everyone. This is another in a series of recent efforts of this genre that tell a scary story in a way that does not make it standard horror fare. If you appreciate a bizarre horror film with a unique way to tell a tale, you may like this one."
2,Boring,"The film had a nice, moody atmosphere but overall was just plain boring and ineffective as a thriller. There is so much better out there. Don't waste your time!"
4,Decent movie with some good moments,"If you live in the U.S. or watch a lot of U.S. horror movies this one will come across as having a very ""foreign"" sensibility. By that I mean that it takes more risks and expects a bit more of the audience, and it delivers a handful or genuinely creepy/frightening moments (think Ringu or the Grudge). That said, it also has a tendency to wander a bit and doesn't have the kind of crappy but tight-knit plot of a lot of American Horror movies.Bottom line...if you're looking for Scream 3, look elsewhere. If you're the kind of person that likes shiver, or let the right one in, this one will probably deliver some worthwhile moments."
1,White Fang Complete Series Collectable Tin,I thought this was the story version of White Fang which it wasn't. This was the TV series so I can't use it in my classroom so I had to go back and purchase the correct video.
2,VERY DRY!,"I found it difficult to listen to this tape all the way through. Most of the time you just want to say ""Get real!!"" I did get one or two good ideas from it although I changed their idea to fit into my family better. If you're desperate, give it a try. Maybe it will get the creative juices flowing enough to give you your own techniques for getting your kids to listen and DO what you ask."
5,complete basic tool,Anyone who need very nice information should read it.The book provide quite day to day information to fit lab routine.It Also explain some impresive insight on future technics. Wiht out doubt I recomended.I gave it 5 star because I use it everyday at work. Lab.Gen e Molecular Biology. InCor. Brazil
1,i hate it,I purchased for my son and when he opened it was in spanish and sone other different languages and english was not one of them.
5,Spanish?,We've been looking for this game for a while. I was thrilled when we found it. We received it in the mail today and opened it up and were shocked to find the game isn't in English! It's a good thing I already know how to play and beat this game so I can help my son. I wish there had been some disclaimer on the product page stating the game came in a different language.
4,Put Another Nickel In,"Here are Teresa's long-lost initial recordings for London, including the original ""Music! Music! Music!"" taken at a much slower pace than you might remember. Her material, and the recording quality, on London doesn't compare to her work on Coral, where the producers, orchestrators and engineers knew exactly how to best showcase her talents. But these recordings remain interesting, particularly the ballads, which reflect her abilities as a serious and thoughtful artist in a way all those novelties didn't. The voice is darker and thicker here than it was later--usually it's the other way around with lady singers, who tend to take on those shadings as they grow older. Teresa's sound actually grew younger. But there's a lot to enjoy here, so keep that old juke box playing!"
3,Nice Compilation of the Early Years,"Jasmine has here collated most of Teresa's rare early recordings for the London label. Along with the typical 1950 novelty garbage (""Molasses, Molasses"" is indeed ""icky sticky goo""), there are some fine ballads that demonstrate that even at this young age, Brewer was a seasoned pro. If only they had included ""He Can Come Back Any Time He Wants To,"" her best torch song from the London period, I'd have given this four stars. Brewer was never suited for all tastes, but you might be surprised to find the roots of her 1970's jazz ""revival"" right here."
1,"She was cute, but really a horrible singer...","In the Korean war, she came aboard our navy ship and performed, she was patriotic, but she couldn't sing at all! She may sound good on cd, but in reality she sang flat and in an annoying squeeky voice. She was cute and I almost creamed my jeans when she walked on stage, but she has no talent waht so ever!!! and this cd's proof of that!"
2,Bad.... just bad,"This band just sucks. The music and vocals just don't mix right. The singer sounds like he would fit in better with Rush than how he sounds with this band. Although, the music does sound decent, the singer's voice just brings it all down. I had the chance of picking this CD up numerous times for $9.99 and just recently came across it for $5.99 brand new but decided against it... I'm glad I decided otherwise. And in response to another reviewer: Unloco is not just rock! They are metal even though you stated otherwise. Bye."
4,Better than solid,"Every song on this album is above average, and that in itself makes it worth listening to. There isn't another band like them right now. I was originally interested in them because two of the guys in the band were in an old Bay Area thrash band named Forbidden, but this is light-years from that band. The singer sounds like Dylan Donkin of Echobrain, and goes by the name ""Pann,"" leading me to believe he might be the same guy. If it's not Donkin, they sound so much alike it's spooky. The production is sound, the musicianship is tight, and the songs are infectious and heavy. Solid, distinctive music. My favorite disc so far in 2003."
2,Not many new ideas,"Although a good starting point, this book is a little thin on new ideas for alternate places to start looking."
4,"Good book, but not her best","This is a very well written book with a plethora of helpful information. Probably the most important concept addressed is the need for most therapists to switch to a business mindset. I'm still working on this myself. I appreciate that Lynn freqently gives different options on addressing different issues. Her awareness that one size does not fit all is well modeled in these examples. There are a number of exercises to help you craft your marketing message and evolve your business mindset. However, herTwelve Months to Your Ideal Private Practice: A Workbook (which she uses for her teleclasses) offers more exercises and is more practical. Her ebook Private Practice SOS offers more updated suggestions and resources. (I recommend both of those books.) That said, I did get several ideas of things that I will further consider to augment my practice.Mike Miller, PhDhttp://establishinganinternetpresence.comhttp://drmikemiller.com"
5,truly amazing!,"This book is fantastic. I've underlined passages, bookmarked pages, and I go bck to them again and again. It's like having a personal business coach for the price of the book! I went from wondering how in the world I could market my private practice, to now seeing limitless possibilities! It should be a must-read for every clinician, both those starting out and those who need a little boost."
5,YES!,"Have you ever wanted to make your own video game? Then this is it! RPG Maker 2 is here, an extremely fun game where you create you own game! You get to write the script, create the storyline, even create movie scenes, and now with the USB keyboard it goes much faster too! This game is incredible! So, go buy it today and see if you got what it takes to make a video game the world will love!"
2,You can make your own fun which is a bonus !,"You can make your own game in 3D !, not this is not Final Fantasy X3 looking but it is basicly just RPG Maker 1 in 3D which is not saying much there are new features but if you play Rpg Maker 1 you know what your basicly getting but its in 3D !"
4,Awesome yet time consuming,"OK, the first one was good. I loved the concept. I spent my first 30 hours just designing characters. But the first one was lacking in 2 things. Graphics and complete customization. The new graphics are amazing, considering the fact that they have to be generic. The customization is supposed to be improved too, but I've heard it's been a little more restricted in some ways. For hardcore RPGers who want to make their own RPG, here's your chance. For the casual RPGer who just plays for fun, you may want to check it out anyway. But at least the can rest assured that they got me sold."
2,A Major Disappointment,"When I first heard that RPG Maker 2 was going to be released, I knew I had to get it. I have a few ideas for rpg's and RPG maker 2 was going to help me bring those ideas to life....or so I thought. I found many flaws in the game right off the bat.1. Characters: You are forced to use just the characters that came with the game. You CAN NOT create your own character from scratch.2. Enemies: Just like characters, enemies can not be created from scratch.3. Map Creator: Extremely complex and very annoying to try to figure out.4. Battle: Today's RPG's must use side battle system. So both enemies and hero party can be seen.If you don't mind the above problems and you love to make rpg's of any kind then by all means this is for you. Otherwise, it is best to skip it and hope that a rpg maker title will come out allowing us to fully customize our rpg ideas. Preferrably one that supports the PSX 2's hard drive and of course keyboard."
4,Pretty complex but it'll be worth it in the end,"I've spent a lot of time planning a game that I'd love to make. Finally, I found PRG Maker 2 and it's able to make it real. Those of you who complain about it need to forget and move on then. THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. Remember that. Obviously the game has many restrictions, because the company can't make a game that good. If you have MUCH patience and a very creative mind, then get this game! I've had it for a few months and I'm still not far at all, and I realize that it'll be an extrememly long time before I am, but it'll be great when I finally am!! (By the way, if you do plan on getting it, it is absolutly necessary that you get some sort of UBS keyboard. This makes it sooo much easier to type rather than pressing the D-Pad a million times just get someone to say a simple message. These keyboards can be found here -where I got mine- for as little as $15! Get one if you get RPG Maker 2.)"
5,RPG MAKER 2,"This game looks amazing. I have never played the first game, but looking at what I've read about it, this sequel will be a great improvment. You will be able to fully customize your own RPG game in 3D, including story line, text, and characters. It will take a long time, but It will be worth it. It will speed things up if you get a keyboard for it. If you are like me and enjoy creating stuff, be sure to get this game."
4,Child of the Wolves- a story worth reading,This book is a vey heart warming book when it comes to trying to fit in. Granite kept trying to fit in and never gave up. That's what made the story so interesting. It was scary in some parts and down right sad in others. Granite was lucky to be taken in by a member of a wolf pack that didn't care if he was a wolf or not. Granite really shows that size and breed dosn't really matter when it comes to living a life.
2,child of the wolves,This book is about a dog that is going to be sold to a guy who likes sled dogs. But granite the dog is scared so he runs away into the woods where he is found by a pack of wolves. They feel sorry for him so they let him be with the pack. Snowdrift a white wolf. Is like his mom she teaches him to hunt and smell for game. Later in the book no one really likes granite because he is not a very good hunter. But then snowdrift is about to fall off a cliff. And granite takes her out before she can fall and die.I would give this book a 4 because it was not that great of book. I did not really like the ending because i thought that it just kind of felt like there was no ending.(...)
5,A Great Book for All Ages,"If you like Fictional Adventure books, you should read Child of the Wolves.It's very unpredictable. If you are an animal lover this book is for you. Once you pick up the book, you won't be able to put the book down. I liked how Granite had to earn his place in the wolf pack. I also liked when Granite encountered the human hunters. My favorite is how Snowdrift, the alpha male, welcomed him to the pack, I thought Snowdrift would kill Granite."
4,Cute Story,"Child of the Wolves is a very adorable story about finding your place and where you belong. Child of the Wolves is about a husky puppy Granite, who runs away after he is going to be sold away from his mother and brothers. While in the woods, Granite finds a wolf pack, and through the rest of the story, tries to find his place within the pack, going from the very bottom and moving his way upward. The story is a cute one, and is recommended for anyone who likes dog books and is most appropriate for children 8-12. However, it may appeal to some older readers as well who are looking for a quick read."
2,Not Impressed,"We bought this keyboard for our daughter at Christmas, when she was 6-7 months. She didn't care for it then, even when I was showing her how to use it, and she's a year now and still only hits the top buttons to get it to play by itself. I think it's great that it can play animal sounds or keyboard sounds, but remarkably, one of my biggest complaints is that even on the loud setting it's too quiet! The keyboard sounds are really muted and dull, and I can see why it doesn't hold her interest for more than a few seconds. She's an active kid, and this just isn't for her. I think she's be better off with an old fashioned xylophone to bang on! That will give her results!"
3,Not the quality I expected,"I bought this for my son, who is now 8 and a half months old, because I liked the animal noises feature. However, the knobs to turn the sound up and switch between animal noises and musical notes are kind of flimsy and seem like they would break easily. I expected the toy to feel more sturdy. The music doesn't play for very long, which annoys my son. He likes the way the keys light up to the music, but loses patience when it stops so quickly, and in mid-note. I wish there were several songs, and that they played longer. It's also kind of an awkward shape for a small child. It tends to slide off my son's lap, so I have to hold it up for him. He then tries to slap it out of my hands. There's too much plastic octopus surrounding the keys, making it kind of hard for him to reach the keys easily unless I hold it up at an angle for him."
2,Not as much information as I expected.,It wasn't really what I expected. It was a fast read and didn't contain a lot of information. I expected more of Edgar Cayce's work or views on the subject.
3,it wasn't as helpful as I hoped,"there was some good information in the book, just not what I was looking for when I placed the order."
3,Stresses All the Wrong Details,"Once you get past the basic premise -- sex between a 40 year old woman and a very young boy, there's nothing especially shocking, or even interesting, about this short novel.Despite its brevity, individual scenes are described in far too much detail -- I think we get about a page and a half devoted to someone brushing his teeth, and there are similar scenes in which we learn the intricacies of trimming nose hairs, ear hairs, etc.And while I was mildly surprised by the twist ending, I wasn't touched by it emotionally or intellectually.To sum up, I've seldom read a book that left me feeling so uninvolved on so many levels."
3,Well written but disturbing,"I dont think of myself as someone that would use the word perversion. . at least not in a negative way. . but I never got comfortable about reading a book that describes in detail the sexual relationship between a stepmother and her very young step-son. Vargas Llosa writes beautifully, there is no doubt. But I still don't want to read a beautifully written passage about a 10 year old seducing a 40 year old."
2,In praise of the stepmother,"This was okay....pretty screwed up really, I read it for art history at uni. The art part of it was quite imaginative, with the ideas regarding the paintings. But the parts where Don Rigoberto performs his 'ablutions' may be interesting for a neurotic male but for a female (well me anyway) are tedious and anal. The little boy stuff was very strange, but all tied in to erotic art and stuff like that, pushing the boundaries. The best bit about it was that there were actually images of the paintings he was talking about in the book."
5,I could have never found myself without her.,I'm speechless. She always does that to me. . . so inventive and personal. I've been to 6 of her concerts and I'd swear I was the only one in the audiTORIum everytime. She connects with people in a way that no other performer could ever dream to.
1,totally missing the most important video!,"I cannot believe they skipped out on ""Far Too Gone"", which is the best video, in my humble opinion, that she's ever made. What a rip-off!!!"
5,it's very good,"this video is very special for me because here i can understand ev'ry song i have heard on the radio or cd , but i must say the some of the videos are very rare like the video of china or cornflake girl (eropean version ) , here at perú tori amos is not so famous but i really love her music and the way she feels the song , but i don't really understand some of the lyrics i think the most fabolus videos of this collection are HEY JUPITER, CAUGHT A LITE SNEEZE , TALULA and RASPBERRY SWIRL . THIS VIDEO IS REALLY GOOD AND I THINK YOU MUST BUY IT ."
1,Hardly Advanced Actionscript,"This book was a major let down. Given the title ""Advanced Training,"" I was certainly expecting more than the book had to offer. The tutorials were long drawn out and unpractical real world situations. I could not foresee apply more than a fourth of what this book shows and the code is very poorly constructed and not very clean.If your an allready experienced Flash user and are looking for something to sharpen your skills I recommend looking else where than to this book. If your a novice Flash user this might be something of interest."
4,very good primer for flash 5 --> flash mx,"if you are new to flash 5 or flash mx, you are going to really enjoy this book. the projects are well thought out and talked to in in easy to understand language. Concepts are explained, and the code for the projects is very clean.I would suggest those starting out, and even some of those who are moving along quickly learning, buy this book."
1,Advanced?,"A agree with the other reviewer of this book... it's not worth it. Most of the information you find in this thing is available on the internet all over the place and doesn't need to be repeated in this book. I recommend ""Macromedia Flash Super Samuri"" instead. There you will find innovative and real-world examples of how to take your Flash authoring to the next level. This book is for absolute beginners."
2,Advanced?? Not really...,"I am into the 4th chapter and I sometimes just can't help but chuckle about the simplicity of this book. The author assumes that the reader is a complete newbie to Flash & ActionScript. He repeats things until the horse is dead, dead, dead! The book is full of fluff to increase the page count.However, if you never touched ActionScript or any programming language then this book is for you. It's a book that will take a newbie to an intermediate level if you can get passed the fluff and not fall asleep to the repeating advice.There are mistakes in the book as well. Ran into one last night that I couldn't believe was missed in the editing process.It's a lesson paced book which is why I bought it but I would opt for something else if you want an ""Advanced"" ActionScript reference."
4,"The book teaches what, how and why of the used actionscript.","Every chapter starts what you will learn and why it is usefull for you to use it. With the assets-files you get an inspiring startingpoint for the project and every step in actionscript is really very well explained. The quality of the actionscript is very good. It is modular and easy to extend by using variables and functions. The completed files can be used not only to compare the final result, but also to copy and paste large portions of actionscript. I recommend this book for intermediate and junior-experts."
5,Finally a Developer who can teach!,"I do a lot of advanced ActionScripting and development, but I have had a lot of holes missing and things that I did not quite understand. This book fills in the gaps that are left out with other Flash books. This book explains the process and programming in a complete and easy to understand fashion. This books shows and explains the how and the why.This is a great book, even if you are more advanced with ActionScript, you'll find yourself understanding more about it and new ways to develop and program your Flash development projects."
5,Best MX book out there.,"This is a great book for users versed with Flash 5, and Flash MX basics who are ready to indulge in the capabilities of Flash MX.Flash MX is a whole new world for web programmers to live in. Unbelievably diverse in its ability to keep users happy, allowing programmers to fully create business applications on the web that are cross browser compatible. Finally Flash has a real world business use. Almost anything you could do with HTML and images can be done in Flash MX. The extent of its capabilities does not end there. Flash Mx is now the centerpoint to applications using XML, ASP, JavaScript and Java.Flash 5 is left in the stoneage making each and every programmer wish that the MX plug-in was loaded on 100% of web browsers.This book gives great examples, and is a great reference for many of MX's new uses, and UI Components.I think this is the best MX book out there today."
5,Great for the intermediate programmer,"I consider myself knowledgable in Flash and an intermediate programmer. This book was right on for me.The tutorials are thorough, well constructed and easy to follow. Everytime I had a question about one of the features being explored in a tutorial, it was answered on the next page.This book is not an introduction to Flash, and it doesn't claim to be. It is great for people with a solid base in using Flash and a little programming experience who are looking to learn action scripting."
4,A good cookie for tots,"At first you may these taste a little strange - but you'll soon realize that they taste REAL, not preserved. They're delicious and you should try to keep them somewhere that you won't raid for your own dessert so you can actually feed them to your toddler!"
5,Very informative!,Really great beginner investigator book...will get you fired up and ready to start your own investigation corporation. Easy to read! Very informative!
4,private investigator handbook,This is a good book even for an established P.I. and if you can't afford a P.I. this book will help you get done whate you want in any type of investigation. jim lear
3,It is OK,This book is OK. It is funny and well written. The advices that are given are suited for practical life. It is well worth buying.
2,Good book but way out of date,"The book was great in its day, but much of the information is very dated."
4,good if used correctly,"I have to disagree with the 1 star reviews. Used on it's own, this syrup is 'ok' but you need to experiment to get the right mix. The ideal mixture for a large latte is to use just one tablespoon of this syrup with a dash of ground cinnamon. I think the 1 star people are using way too much."
1,Bitter,"Chasing that wonderful Pumpkin Spice Latte' flavor I tried almost every conceivable concoction ... and I have learned a lot a long the way! First and foremost, the extra cost for the sauce vs the syrup is WELL worth it. The sauce offers a full bodied, truly genuine flavor that has no after taste or bitter residue - Whereas, this syrup is bitter regardless of the amount used. I can't imagine that muffins or coffee cakes would fair any better, however, I haven't tried cooking with this product so that is pure speculation. Bottom line, every time I put this syrup into a drink (cold or hot) it ruined it... completely!"
1,disappointed,"Although I regularly purchase, Davinci Pumpkin Spice SAUCE, and will continue to do so; the syrup was a big dissapointment. To me it had very little flavor at all,much less pumpkin pie. I do not mean to down the brand, because I LOVE the SAUCE (pumpkin pie) from DaVinci. I wish I could get a refund on the syrup."
1,Horrible,"Tried the sugar free version. Taste was just awful. Weird cinnamon taste and nothing close to pumpkin spice.Don't even try it on coffee, gross!Save your money."
2,Nothing new here folks,"Since I couldn't find a tracklisting for this CD anywhere, I went ahead and purchased it, since I love both the ""Cochise"" and ""Like a Stone"" singles. ""Show Me How To Live"" has the following tracklisting:1. Title track2. Super Stupid (Live BBC Radio 1 Session)3. Like a Stone (Live BBC Radio 1 Session)4. Gasoline (Live BBC Radio 1 Session)Look familiar? If you have the ""Like a Stone"" EP, it should, because all three bonus tracks on this are on there too. While the cover of Funkadelic's ""Super Stupid"" is really cool, and makes the CD a decent purchase, the fact remains that you can get ""Like a Stone"" (which has a live Letterman version of ""Set it Off"" as well) for the exact same price. They've been doing enough live shows, can't we get a new live track for new singles?"
5,Best album of 2003,"How can this band be so ignored by the mainstream music world! This is a fantastic album from a very very talented band! This is ""Weight of the world""'s little brother. Not as hard rockin', but maybe the best songwriting overall. This album is so loaded with great songs and positive emotion and energy, I can hardly put it into words. A MUST HAVE for anyone into melodic rock! The best album of 2003."
1,terrible,this was a terrible movie. it was slow and didnt make a whole lot of sense. i wanted to return it for a full refund but because i opened it it was to late.
2,SLOW,"In His Fathers's Shoes was ok. I purchased it becasue, Louis Gossett Jr. is a great actor. I personally didn't enjoy the movie."
4,DVD: In His Father's Shoes,"Good family entertainment.Similar to ""Back to the Future"" but having good points about family life.A young boy's father dies, but by some magical shoes, the boy goes back in timeto learn about his father's life."
3,Touching Movie,"I finally received the movie. I just knew that I had purchased a wide screen version, but received a full screen version. Plus I looked all over for the free music CD and never found it. I can't seem to get an option to contact the seller to discuss this with them, but I really would like the music CD. When the DVD first came up, it stated one price, but when I went to purchase it a different price would come up. I could not seem to get it for the price which was listed during the search. But I love Louis Gossett, Jr. and felt that I would love the movie with the CD, but only received half. I was hoping that once I played the movie, that the music might be part of the DVD, but it was not. There were not even any special features. I would really like to rest of the purchase."
2,They missed almost half the concert!!,"If you're expecting all the songs from the VHS version, you're out of luck. This DVD is missing 7 songs from the VHS version. 7 songs!!The company that produces this must only know how to put about an hours worth of video on a DVD. Could someone please let them know that, if done right, the whole concert could have been placed on one DVD? <sigh>Here's what you get on the DVD: Time Machine, Children of the Grave, I Witness, Mob Rules, Into The Void, Anno Mundi, Symptom of the Universe, Headless Cross, Paranoid. You also get the drum and guitar solos and the video for Feels Good To Me.What's missing: Black Sabbath, Neon Knights, Psychophobia, Wizard, Cross of Thorns, Iron Man, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath."
2,Cross Purposes LIVE! NOT! Just another eye-sore here!,"The only reason this version did not get a 1 star rating was it does include the entire concert originally released on VHS back in 1995! The rest is one big downer for all Sabbath legacy fans! This footage is definitely copied from a VHS source with horrific sound and muddied picture quality! It's just like a few other edited releases out there with select tracks only? What's up with these teaser copies? What a huge waste of effort and time! Maybe someday a logical remastered or Blu-ray version of this Sabbath/Tony Martin era concert will finally surface on earth? I guess stay tuned for a while longer?? For now, it's Cross Purposes LIVE! NOT! Just another eye-sore here!"
4,Great product Middle Atlantic PD-915R,We have bought this product for years without any problems. We continue do buy these and hope to in the future.
5,"Intill This Movie Is Released In The U.S. And Selling At Amazon, Go To Netflix And Rent It!","A movie you can't ""Love"", that's not why I gave it 5 stars, but it is a very important movie for all to see. Lukas Moodysson has cemented himself as one of the great young directors in Europe with this dark, extremely depressing, yet very important film. After watching Lilya's life unfold into what can only be described as ""literally"" hell on earth (Even worse then hell on earth), You will never forget her pain, her face (and in so, the millions of faceless children & adults who are enslaved in the underground sex industry that Lilya's character represents). At least that's the little bit of hope that I got from the story, which is filled with everything except hope. You will be mentally drained and mad as hell at the human race when this movie is over, but to me that's great movie making. A very, very, important movie!"
5,Painfully real,"An absolutely brilliant movie!It starts out sort of Run Lola Run-y, only not so sweet.The soundtrack pounds relentlessly courtesy of Rammstein.Set in the former Soviet Union (Estonia), the young heroin Lilya (Wonderfully played by Akinshina) takes us through a morbid, but very lifelike tale of abandonment, prostitution, abuse, betrayal, and suicide.Although the film is very sad, Lilya and Volodya remain loveble characters. A frightening eye-opener to life of some less fortunate people everywhere in the world"
5,A Small Masterpiece,The film follows a 16 year-old girl who is left to fend for herself in the Russian Federation and in poverty.What keeps her story from flat heartbreak or painful downward spiral is her strength.Never before has a film been able to capture prostitution without being erotic. This does.It will change your life.
4,Shocking but Excellent,"This is a shocking but absolutely wonderful film which tells the story of Lilja, a sixteen year old who is abandoned by her mother in poverty stricken Russia who is forced to turn to prostitution in order to survive. She then meets a handsome and charming man who promises her a new life in Sweden but it doesn't turn out how she imagines....I would give the film a five but the DVD is surprisingly disappointing with almost no extras. If you don't want subtitles in any language other than English (you can only have the Scandinavian languages anyway) then buy the video."
1,How can this be a greatest hits collection...,"How can this be a ""greatest hits"" collection when it does not include ""Sixteen Tons""?It may be a good cd, I haven't heard it. But in looking for a greatest hits collection of Ernie Ford, I would expect for any ""greatest hits"" collection to have the one song he is MOST KNOWN FOR on it."
4,Fu Sheng against the Vemons,This Shaw Brothers film has all of the venoms cast in a story that takes on many turns Fu Shengs character is an expert knife thrower who is a hired killer. Lo Meng who also is a knife tossing expect who and every other character in this film are all after a secret treasure they in turn are all fighting each other. Not a 5 star movie but has a lot of different characters using a variety of styles.
2,I feel that the book was ok.,I feel the book could of been much better. I did not agree about the way she spoke about her mother because regardless your mother will always be your mother.
1,Just what we need: Another weepy AIDS-death memoir,"An utter waste of paper and ink. In this memoir-as-genre age, these kinds of books have become the last word in banality."
3,INTERESTING STYLE,"This is a poignant book, written much like a journal. It is lyrical prose mourning the loss of Kincaid's brother from AIDS, and in a greater sense the loss of her childhood stolen by a demanding mother, ill father, and half-brothers who drained the family provisions. My eyes were opened to abject proverty that I, as an American, know so little about. Antigua is so improverished the hospital is just a holding place for death. Only through Jamaica's efforts, is her brother afforded any medications. The story is poignant and expressive. Perhaps, because it reads like a mourning journal, I never felt comfortable reading it, and was relieved to complete this short novel. Not my favorite book, but worth reading, not the least reason being education."
4,A Complicated Work,"I'm still thinking through the issues raised in ""My Brother"" -- and I suspect that it will be one of those books which, though it feels a bit hollow as I read it, will turn out to haunt me in the future. Only time will tell. The most remarkable thing about it, I think, is the way that Kincaid refuses to valorize any of the characters she describes. The incredible ire towards her mother is the only emotion that feels puzzling, given the lack of context for it -- I kept waiting for a revelation there that never came. With this exception, however, Kincaid seems committed to presenting a balanced portrayal: she does not heroize the dead, nor does she portray herself as particularly wise or noble in the face of death. It is this commitment to a human, complex portrayal that makes the description unique.I just want to add that I am only posting this to counteract what appears to be a long list of high school book reports that make up most of the ""reviewing"" on this page. ..."
2,"I was looking forward to this book, but was disappointed.","After reading this book I couldn't come up with a good reason for praising it. It seemed repetitive and left me questioning whether this book was about the author's brother, or the author and her mother. I felt vey little connection with anyone except the doctor who treated her brother. What an example of human kindness and compassion!"
3,The book is very intresting.,"Although the topic Jamaica Kincaid's book isn't my favorite,I will recomend it to my friends."
1,take it to therapy,"OK I hate my mother as much as the next woman, but thankfully I didn't try to turn my whining into art by the use of the rather dubious device of repetition. Her mother didn't even seem that bad and if you take into account her generation and cultural back ground she was probably what we feminists call a `good woman'. As for her relationship with her brother -same. Give it a rest, take it to therapy and get over it. Boring book."
3,This book could have been a lot shorter,"I was tired of reading the book by the time I finally got through it. It wasn't very long but it was quite challenging for me to finish reading it. The author repeats herself a lot! Which does make for an interesting writing style. It seemed like it was a poetry of sorts; but I gave up that idea after the first 25 pages or so. I am glad I did keep up reading it until I finished it, it just was wasn't that good."
2,The book tell about Jamica relationship with her family & .,"Her brother siknes and also the way she was treated as child she though it was unfear to her that her mother made felt to her, but late she understood that everything her mother did was because she loves her. At the end she discovered that she love her brother in her way too."
4,Where The Red Fern Grows,"I bought this movie for my niece. I did however watch it, and enjoyed it. The quality of the sound and picture was very good."
4,Fine mini-series,"I loved the first installment and this just built upon all that was good.Fine writing, elegant production, splendid acting. The voice of the man who plays Garrow is like honey."
5,Fabulous series,"Watch series one first. This is one of the finest productions ever. The music, costumes, script, acting and directing are top quality. Too bad the U.S. is not more interested in this type of historical drama. Anxiously awaiting series 3!"
4,Wonderful combo at their best yet,"If every track on here were like Confuse-a-Blues, it would have gotten 5 stars from me. That track has gotten more playing time at hardcore music parties than any other in recent memory with requests for more. I have to admit, I wasn't a huge fan of Stuart Hamm from the get go. Gambale and Smith always were ones I followed from first hearing. But, this group really came together on this cd with some challenging and ""in your face"" tracks on here...Hamm being a very nice part of it.If you are a hardcore ""fusionistic"" music fan like me who really enjoys just a trio laying it down and challening your listening skills, this may be a good one to pick up. Although, that is what is nice about these websites...you can listen before you make the mistake of buying a $15 lemon."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product for a large cooking. I use it for soups, chile, vegetables and whatever for a large crowd. Would recommend it to someone that cooks for a crowd."
4,A good album,"This is a good album, but there are a few songs that I normally skip. Randy Rogers is good, but I don't think they are on par with some of the other Texas country bands (Pat Green, Cross Canadian, Reckless Kelly, etc.)"
5,awesome as usual !!!,I fell in love with this band on vacation in houston a few years back- now I'm hooked on the TEXAS RED DIRT sound- only I have to listen on line to get it here in Oregon! Every album The Randy Rogers Band puts out is great-They are my ring tones even-Cant wait for this wknd as they are playing here in Oregon!!!
5,Real Good,They will probably never rock like this again with the major label and Radney Foster influence. The next album is more countrified and not as good. This is the Randy Rogers you want in your collection.
1,Caswell-Massey - Gardenia Signature Scent,"Don't buy it! I bought Caswell-Massey Gardenia Signature Scent Lotion and loved the natural scent of gardenia. I was so impressed I asked my husband for the Signature Scent Spray for my birthday gift because I wanted a longer lasting gardenia scent. The Signature Scent Spray doesn't smell anything like gardenias nor the lotion. If you like gardenia scented lotion, by all means, buy that. But...back to the Sniff Analysis Room for the Caswell-Massey Gardenia Signature Scent SPRAY Team!"
3,What I thought of this book,"First of all , I'd like to say I'm a fan of Benrard Miles, I loved his ""Favorite Tales From Shakespeare"". This had good stories and fairly acurate retellings but still something was missing. I did not like how Mr. Miles retold how Robin Hood became an outlaw nor do I like that he had Maid Marian die before Robin(none of the other books ruin the plot like this). Truly this is a dissapointment from such a good author as Mr. Miles."
3,great doorknob book,"very good for identification of door hardware. Not so great for timelines of makers,marks or anything else that was not in the pictures presented. It was helpful and a good book to own, but it is very narrow in scope to entrance door type hardware."
1,Unbelievable!,"What is Mrs. Broer thinking? You want to help people, then make a book that people can afford...Who do you think you are charging $192. for a cookbook!!!!!!!!! Unbelievable!"
1,Arrived smashed,"I purchased two of these adhesive wraps from this vendor. They were mailed in a plastic bag. They arrived smashed and unable to use. If they had been mailed in a box, I believe that they would have been fine. They also arrived late. I was very disappointed in this purchase. It was not worth spending extra time and money to ship them back for a refund."
2,does the job but got short on expectations,"The set looks nice but that's about it, has a good variety of sizes which is a plus, it will do the job but do not expect clean results. The heads of the punches were not totally round some were totally out of shape. Some punches have really pronounced nicks that will transfer to the metal, the punch block is in the small size but just OK. Need to keep them oiled all the time or they start rusting fast but that is normal. The wood block holds the punches but some holes are too small or big so the punches have the tendancy to fall, I needed to put paper to keep them in place. In my opinion, if you need this for serious work do yourself a favor and spend a little more and buy a good set."
2,"Bizarre, unresearched, confusing","I decided to read this book because I'm interested in the fluidity that is present in (especially women's) sexual orientation. I was surprised to find out that most of the women in this book, while they call themselves lesbians, are still married to men. This book may be good for married women who discover they are attracted to women, but for anyone looking for an insightful read on sexual fluidity and sexuality/gender studies, this book is of pretty poor quality. The author insists on using outdated terms like ""sexual preference"" and ""same-gender relationships"", and cites far too much Oedipal/Freudian theory. When she does cite research, it doesn't fit with the flow of the book and is random. Overall, I find it utterly perplexing that women can somehow maintain a lesbian identity while being married to men. But hey, if this is your predicament, this book may be of insight to you."
5,"If you enjoy hearing rancheras, you'll love Origenes","I only discovered Alex in the last 5mos. I see a lot of his music videos and concert videos on [...]. It was only after seeing, his video compliation called Trayectoria that I felt I had to order this CD. Alejandro does no disappoint his fans who want to hear the essence of classic Mexican music called rancheras or mariachi. Alex is in the process of crossing over to a more pop soft rock sound to broaden his fan base. I am happy to hear he continues to include this music in his concerts as well as his newer material. I know when I see him in concert, he will once again not disappoint."
5,Glorious SOUND!!!!,"Alejandro Fernandez Has One Of The Most Breathtaking Voice Of All-Time, No Matter What Style Music He Sings He Brings New Life & Beauty To It!!! As For This Cd The Main Thing I'd Like To Call Attention To Is The SOUND!!! The Arrangements, Mixing & Engineering Are Simply Beyond Words!!! Never Have I Heard Such Stunning Musicality To Add To Such A Gorgeous Voice!!! I Long To Hear Alejandro Sing With Barbra Streisand!! And I Can't Wait Until He Records A Christmas Album!!!(SWOOOOON)"
4,"Return of ""El Potrillo""","This is vintage Alejandro Fernandez. No singer in Latin music has made the improvements that Fernandez has made. He has always possessed a powerful voice. Now he accompanies that with a tender almost whisper-like technique that really captures the emotion of each song. For my money, this is a must have, in the wonderful evolution of Alejandro Fernandez's singing career."
3,Not what I expected,"If you're looking for a ""business in a box"" scenario for your financial services practice, this is not it. The tools and templates are gleaned from several different places, and lack consistency in quality and design. In addition, they will have to be customized and ""compliancized"" for your practice.Not exactly what I expected from someone so well known in the industry."
4,We love it!,"We are delighted with this vanity. I just got the water running. It was packaged with 4"" foam all around, and was not damgaged at all, from shipping. It is easy to install, and all together took around 1-2hrs to assemble, and another couple hours getting all the plumbing hooked up. I did have to modify the lower drawer to accomodate the water valves, but otherwise the plumbing fit nice."
4,Holmes gets bruized,"This is a great Jeremy Brett. It is about a man who marries all his wives and kills them or does something horrbile like pouring acid on a lady. At the end, that same lady throws acid on his face. He keeps a journal of each of is wives. He puts a picture and descirption for each one on each page! Two thugs go after HOlmes and Holmes gets the upper hand of them but they finaly beat him clubbing him with their canes. He has so many bruizes when their finished. This is a classic!"
4,Not What I Was Expecting But Great Album Nontheless,I figured this album would have some native american sounds to it but it doesn't. What this album offers however is a different sound to gospel music one that I would never expect to hear. To me this album sounds like an interpretation of Barry White or Frank Sinatra style music although the lyrics are much more christian sound and inspired. I like this album alot. It's unique and fun. The only problem is I don't know if I should be listening to this album by myself or in the company of a beautiful christian woman.
1,Being cheated,"The picture attached is in a pair. And it is believed to be sold in pair, just like shoes.When it is delivered, there is only one arm support.The picture is totally misleading. It should show only one arm support, with the person rest only one arm on it. Else, it is a trap."
3,Garage-punk compilation,"It's good, but not too much.Recommended just to love to collect every punk band from the sixties."
1,BETTER LEFT IN THE GARAGE,"The bottom of the garage barrel. Except for a cover of the Yardbirds ""A Certain Girl,"" not a melody to be found - just a bunch of teenage boys trying to sound tough - and even failing at that. Boring."
3,Where are the photos?,This is such a huge book and has some great information in it but the book has only black and white photos and they are very small. For the price I expected colored photos and large enough to see what they were showing.
1,This book needs an editor!,"If I read one more sentence that starts with ""this,"" I'm going to go drink milk right from a cow! Typos on the first page, and poor writing throughout."
1,Muy disgustado,"Este disco lamentablemente no sirve, son las versiones originales pero les han introducido una especie de poemas al principio lo que no permite disfrutar las canciones. NO VALE LA PENA. Los de Univisión lamentablemente están vendiendo productos que ofenden."
1,"0 STARS: In all honesty, this is a pretty sorry movie. Sadly, I've seen worse.","""The Butcher"" is a low-budget slasher flick along the same lines as ""Wrong Turn"" although ""Wrong Turn"" is clearly superior than this trash, albeit, that does not say much. In a sense, ""The Butcher"" tries to be a mixture of ""Wrong Turn"" and the the remake of TCM. The kills aren't that great and are indicative of a low budget horror flick, there is zero horror movie atmosphere, and the acting is below average for this type of flick. Also, much of the action, these characters (including the killers) and the storyline are all just plain stupid!!! Very immature horror movie here...defintely one for the teenagers although I would not let me teenager watch this trash if I had one. All of these flaws make for a movie that simply is not worth a cuss, and that's my main complaint (along with the overly-retarded ending of course-they actually outdid themselves with that)."
1,BUTCHERED HORROR,"Even fans of this gore-infested movie must be getting tired of the ripoffs of other films of this ilk, like TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACE, HILLS HAVE EYES, etc.Anyway, ONCE AGAIN, we have this collection of college-age students who are going off on some kind of trip only to be detoured and finding themselves at the mercy of a whacko hillbilly with demented wife and daughter. There is NOTHING original in this movie, and the ending makes no sense since a supernatural undertone was never established so the killer's reappearance is totally unbelievable.Stay away unless you just like to persecute yourself."
3,worth a rental...,"I generally enjoy finding horror flicks that are obscure and low budget, and this one was at least better than most. I would never recommend buying it, but it is creepy with some real moments of tension, and a bit bloody. It is, however, riddled with horror cliches and some of the dumbest decions by the characters imaginable. Someone mentioned the darknsess of the film, but I saw it fine. Maybe it's the TV. It gets three stars for what it is, compared to other movies in its genre and budget."
2,"Don't go into old farm houses, haven't you ever seen a horror movie?","This movie was pretty bad. I know that it was a B-horror flick, but come on. There were a couple of good actors but most were not that good even for a B flick. Yes, this movie was a rip off from other movies, but there was one movie that the rest of the critics missed and that was Jeepers Creepers. The only reason that I gave it 2 stars was because of a couple of the actors and there were a couple of scares in it that were pretty good. I don't recommend this movie even for the B-horror fans."
5,Perfect to go around...,"I believe is the best,as it protects your GBAd and your cartidges,and makes you feel save to go around on your bike or skate;or why not to leave it at home and make sure that if your maid or dog walk by nothing will happen to it.But don't expect to place a lot extra, perhaps your wormlight,a couple of extra batteries and some coins.questions?sure!:mario.mendoza@csfb.com"
2,are we listening to the same cd?,"i love bowie and all of his stuff, but i do grant that in order to love it, you need to give his stuff time, just like a fine wine, you may hate it at first but then you'll love it later(pin-ups or aladin sane) but this cd as well as buddah of suburbia, i just cant get into, sorry david :( too scary for me, but i dunno"
4,I like it.,Got mine for less at other store (Sorry Amazon). It's my first try at pilates and I really like how easy it is to set up and use. I just wish it came with more exercise moves to go with it.
3,No manual...,"I was expecting a manual with this. Luckily it isn't difficult to put together, but the 4 pictures of exercises on the packaging-taped box are limiting me to what I can do. Guess I'll have to find the exercises online..."
3,Eh..,"Petal Blossom is really beautiful. But I don`t recommend having her curled mane & tail brushed. I made the mistake of brushing her mane & now it`s frizzy as anything. I have been unable to fix that. But aside from the hair problem, she`s been a nice addition. :)"
3,Doesn't include the baby bonus pony as pictured!,"I got this item recently and it did not have the baby pony that is shown in the pictures. Apparently, the baby pony was a bonus item on the earlier version, and is no longer included in the new version. Its too pricey for just one pony, so beware!I was able to pick up one of these with the baby pony at a local retail store, but they are getting harder to find, being replaced with the newer packaging."
3,Disappointed Grandma,"My granddaughter was heart broken when her ponies arrived. When we purchased another long hair pony at the store, it came with a baby pony so when we seen the Blossom pony with the baby we thought it came with it. Items that are available to order should not have extra items pictured if they are not included. This in my opinion is false advertising. We will not order from this site in the future."
4,Insightful Journey to India,"Told through rich imagery along the sacred waters of the Ganga River, Claire invites you to embark on a very personal journey of self-revelation and spiritual growth. Her search to know and serve God is fueled by a willingness to leave behind past attitudes and to love without judgement or separation. Faithful effort is given to understanding situations that arise and learning that there are no accidents. When met with the unexpected river voyager - be it human or animal - Claire's account is told with humor and honesty. You feel her rapture with each realization and her uncertainty with each challenge. I hope she takes the advice of her newfound `angel' and visits Nepal. We could all benefit from the trip."
1,Buy Another Alarm Clock,I bought this alarm clock after my last one went out and after just one night completely hated it. Don't let the box fool you. You cannot choose the track you want to wake up to. Turning off the alarm clock in the morning is hard the alarm clock itself is even difficult to set and make sure you have it right. The BIG button at the bottom isn't even what shuts off the alarm it's the snooze button the alarm off button is this super tiny button at the top left which is very hard to find the morning while you are still rubbing sleep from your eyes. Please spare yourself the pain and look at a different alarm clock.
1,Died after 4 months,"I bought this item for my 5yr old daughter's bedroom. I wanted a clock and simple cd player so she could listen to her music in her room. Yes, the display panel is very bright, however, she liked it for a night light. Yes, the sound quality is not the best, but she's five and didn't need high quality surround sound for her Ralph's World and Annie cd's. My problem is that after 4 months the thing just up and quit on me. The display panel continues to be very bright, however there are no LED numbers and none of the functions will work. I expected more from Philips."
1,Like having a spotlight in your bedroom! You're gonna need eye shades,"The display is so incredibly bright, even on ""dim"", that it lights up the bedroom like a spotlight! I put a folded piece of paper over the clock the first night to tone down the light. There was no second night; I took it back to Best Buy and got a refund. Don't they test these things before sending them to market? Incredible."
1,Don't waste your money,"I just got this for Christmas and hate it! The buttons are terribly small, and you can't find them in the dark. I have to sit up and turn on the light to find the snooze button! It is hard to set the alarm.Spend the money and buy one with a better design."
1,Horrible Sound,"I own two Philips CD/Alarm Clocks that work great. When I needed a 3rd, the original one's I owned had been discontinued. I found this model and thought that since Philips made it and the other models I had worked great, that I would go ahead and purchase it. Bad move.The lighting is horrible. The functionality is poor. Most important, the sound quality is beyond poor. I would compare it to what I would imagine speakers from a 62 Nova that has been sitting out in the rain for the last 40+ years would sound like. I would recommend not purchasing this item."
2,Not A Good Buy,"The blue display light is far too bright. Also, radio reception is poor and Am is constantly hissing. I highly suggest buying a different model"
3,night light,The large display on this clock was far too bright. I returned it as I found it very annoying even on the dimmer level.
3,Post-apocalypse with Pirates,"""False Dawn"" is one of Yarbro's earlier novels telling of a bleak post-apocalyptic future.Marauding Pirate gangs that don't give up, mutations (both planned and not), rapes, starvation, killer spiders, cold, volcanoes, killer monks.While not the best P-A book I've ever read (nor the best Yarbro book), ""False Dawn"" held my interest and is a pretty fair example of one of the earlier tries at the genre.NOTE: The cover on this version of the book - bloody wolf riding a motorcycle - has absolutely nothing to do with the book (but it looks cool)."
3,A worthy beginning,"I find myself going back to this book on a regular basis. Unlike most of my Science Fiction Book Club purchases from decades back, I kept this one. Maybe I'm just a sap for end-of-the-world fiction, but there's a solid tale here, one that's well written, and one of the first of its type, at least in my experience."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"A really pretty ordinary post apocalyptic tale. A man and a womanwander a nasty future wasteland in search of something that neitherthey or the reader really seems to become sure of, in the end. Thereare the usual mutants and other nasties of such a setting, but thereare plenty of better examples of the genre that you could try outbefore getting tot his one."
2,Interesting,"I think that this book included a couple of true facts, but a lot of imagination, how could you know what someone about 100-110 years ago was thinking.I think Flora Seymour did fairly well job, considering that she was writing a children's storybook. I applaud you Flora Seymour!"
3,nothin special,a boring album my love and make you sweat are nice tracks the rest is slow and boring
1,I'll Give All My Love to You,"I have not received this package, been waiting just over a month now. Please follow up and advise. Your assistance would be appreciated."
4,"Some truly hilarious scenes, terrific lead actors","This is a buddy/cop movie with a Latin American twist. The two lead actors are awesome, so are the villains. The plot stetches credibility toward the end, but I liked the tone of the movie. It is not a movie about reality. It is a movie about buddy movies. It worked for me."
1,Causes artifacts from interactions between filter & front camera element,"Edit 9/10/11 -- Please see sample pics. I posted a pic showing the reflection caused by this filter. For some reason my sample pic has been voted helpful by 95% of people who saw it, and this review has been 40% helpful, so I wanted to add this note to be sure to go look at accompanying picture.--I could easily replicate conditions where having the filter on the camera would create slight ""ghost reflections""See gallery for example shot. Once filter was removed, ghost image disappears.Don't think a good multicoated filter would show this kind of aberration.Basically makes this useless when you wonder anytime you take a photo of something bright in the frame you are worried about losing the shot forever."
5,Just right,"I ordered this filter to protect the lens for my new D-90. It fits perfectly and does the job well. I see no change in images before or after. Simple, does the job, price is good. Anyone buying a lens should use one."
2,Lid is impossible to clean / dry,"My only complaint with this product is that you cannot clean between the two pieces of plastic that make of the lid. You can run hot water in there, but then it's impossible to dry. If they just let you separate the two pieces, that would solve the problem. Unfortunately, they did not. Food prep tools shouldn't be difficult to clean, especially with the lettuce / spinach bacteria scares that come up in the news every couple of years. Otherwise, this product works quite well and has held up for over 4 years so far."
4,Zyliss Easy Spin - My Choice,"I make salad every day--lots of it. The only spin salad maker that truly ""dries"" the salad is the pull-spin type. I've tried the others, but always go back to this one.The one drawback is that it won't last too long if you use it heavily, because either the string will break or the notches stop catching, preventing the spin.However, I'd still always go back to this one."
3,Why did they mess with success?,"I've owned 2 Zyliss Salad spinners, both of which I've worn out. I use them a lot.This redesign is awkward to use and doesn't dry lettuce/greens as well as the previous design. I'm really disappointed."
3,Disappointment,Bulky. OXO is better made. Noisy. Takes forever to dry after rinsed. Would not recommend. Sorry. Too lazy or I would have returned it.
5,Pull String salad spinner.,"Best product of it's kind at this time. I've tried many different type spinners, and they all suck. I wish the bottom bowl was heavier and more solid, but otherwise, it is a good product. I hate the fact that they don't sell this product on the Zyliss site, but at least they sell it on Amazon. Yayyyyyyy!!!!!"
2,Zyliss Large Salad Spinner,"While this salad spinner has a fairly large capacity and is relatively easy to operate, I feel it does not spin the lettuce as dry as the one I previously owned. (It broke and I can't find the same one.) As a result, I need to spin the lettuce several times and there's still water clinging to the leaves. Because of this my salad dressing is sometimes watered down (which I really dislike). I'm disappointed in this item and I'm considering ordering another salad spinner from another manufacturer. This item is definitely over-priced and does not perform the way I'd expect a Zyliss product to perform."
4,"Excellent, high-quality, effective",This works so well that my mother asked for one after seeing how well ours worked. The only downside is that it's a bit tricky to clean the top. Otherwise it's excellent. We use ours for everything from lettuce to mushrooms.
1,A Loser,"This is truly the very worst salad spinner I've ever used. I bought it because I'd had a Zyliss that worked beautifully for more than 15 years. True, it wasn't transparent and didn't have the sleek, modern look of this one, but it got the greens dry. This one is easy enough to use -- just pull the string for an appropriate amount of time -- not exactly rocket science. Result: alas, wet, wet, wet. The only way to use the greens is to hand dry them. Moreover, said greens would rot if I tried to store them in the refrigerator overnight. The Amazon rating system seems to require a minimum of one star; left to my own devices, I'd give the Zyliss Salad Spinner none!"
5,Great on-line purchase...,This purchase was the ideal on-line purchase experience. I knew the price of the product in the shops and the online price (including shipping) was slightly less! Convenience and service al in one package.Wow! Smokey...
2,WHAT A BIG DISSAPOINTMENT!!!,"Monica has such a beatiful voice and I love her image but the songs on this CD are wack. I was dissapointed to find that there were only 4 decent songs to listen to. The title track, angel of mine, take him back, and the first night. I have to blame Dallas Austin for his wack songs. It's because of him that TLCs latest albun isn't as good as it could be. Your better off just buying the singles 'cause thats all thats hittin'. I haven't totally given up on Monica because she's very talented, but she need to find a producer that has just as much talent as she does."
3,monica album is alright,"Well to all you monica fans out thier her album nice but don't take my words for it only ,monica album is good although my sister told me not to get it but i like it so don't alway take advice from other cause i ended up liking it a-lot ."
4,Very Good,Very difrent from her first one. I enjoyed this one much more I felt she put a lot more feeling int this album. I think it a great buy. Monica if you are reading Great Work and Contact Me.
3,Monicas c.d . is all right,monica isa talanted young artist and she had few songs that i liked but she lacks that innocence that brandy is said to have .
1,"Monica, you could've done much better!!!!","I was very unpleased with this CD. I regret I bought it. The only songs worth listening to are ""The First Night"", ""Misty Blue"", and ""Right Here Waiting."" Have you noticed that two of these songs are remakes? Monica and her staff lack creativity and originality big-time!!! Monica should never be compared to Brandy. She has a nice voice but she just can't compete with Brandy."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY FAVORITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think this cd is GREAT!!! and I love the songs she writes. My favorite is ""The Boy is Mine"". I hope Monica continues to write and sing songs just as good as this!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great Set,"Monica's 1998 sophomore album THE BOY IS MINE does not disapoint. Starting with the fresh sound on ""Street Symphony"", definatley my favorite track here, it sets the mood and pace for the album. Next is the hit single, ""The Boy Is Mine"", with Brandy, a tale of two lovers torn by the cheating man. ""The First Night"" is another funky song, sure to impress. She handles a cover of ""Misty Blue"" gracefully! ""Angel of Mine"" is the best ballad here, Monica sounds comfortable with this song as she slides through it gracefully. ""Inside"" is a nice touch too. The duet with 112 is another welcome addition on ""Right Here Waiting"". Overall there is a nice mixture of R&B, with hints of hip hop, and some compelling ballads here, making for a great album. Check it out!"
2,This cannot be true!!,"Although I love Monica's voice, this cd was a horrible disappointment. Brandy's last album was so much better. I hate albums filled up with covers (Misty Blue, Right here waiting, Angel of mine). Eternal did a good job with the last one not too long ago, so why the hell did she choose this song. I couldn't stand hearing the songs ""the first night"" and ""street symphony"". I listened to it a few times, but they do nothing for me. Sad, 'cause I loved her first cd and I'm still really looking forward to her third, hoping that it will sound nothing like this one. If it does, I will choose Brandy over Monica anytime."
3,This cd is o.k,"I gave this cd 3 stars because I really only like 2 songs on it. Right here waiting is a really nice song. I also like for you I will.I didn't buy this cd,I borrowed it. It's not worth buying In my opinion."
3,Why the Comparison ?,"Why does everyone have to always compare Brandy and Monica. They are both good artists with their own styles. Brandy's style is a little edgier and more contemporary, while Monica's is more soulful and old school. They are both good at what they do. This album by Monica is good, not the best, but good. Angel of Mine is definitely a hot song."
3,"Not total trash, but no Miss Thang either","90s contemporary R&B was given one of its greatest, most enduring albums when Monica made Miss Thang in 1995 (when she was only 14). Three years later, much of the magic of that album is gone. She saves it from being completely worthless with the beautiful, all-age-appealing ballads ""For You I Will"" and ""Angel Of Mine,"" but everything else is pretty weak, and the utterly pathetic hit ""The Boy Is Mine"" (a duet with Brandy) was reportedly made to capitalize on the publicity surrounding the fact that, at that time, the two girls actually were having a fight over a guy in real life."
5,the 4 best songs on the album,this album is ok it is very smooth 4 songs i like in this album isi keep it to myselfinsidemisty bluestreet symphony only songs on here i really like
5,Got To Give It Up To The TRUE Princess of R&B!,"Monica is the best singer to come along since the rush of young female R&B singers in the mid-nineties. While she works hard to record meaningful and intelligent songs others walk away with the publicity and fame. Hands down Monica's sophmore release will leave other so-called divas in the lurch forever. Monica's style and intelligence shows through and her presence of being a respectable young lady makes her songs that much more enjoyable. This was the best album of its time and one of the best R&B albums around. Don't waste your time buying whiners like Brandy, stick to Monica...the true Princess of R&B with the beautiful ballads and platinum voice to match!"
4,IT WAS OKAY,I THINK THAT THE ALBUM WAS ALRIGHT I COULD USE A LITTLE HELP; ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SING WAY BETTER THAN BRANDY SHE SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S WHISPERING OR TRYING TO SCREAM AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS OR SOMETHING. BUT MONICA SHE SOUNDS CLEAR NOT VAGUE WE DON'T HAVE TO SIT UP CLOSE TO THE SPEAKER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. BUT YOUR VOICE IS RAGING FOR NO HELP AT ALL AND YOUR IMAGE IS SO CUTE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. FORGET WHAT THEY SAY.
3,A PRETTY SOLID ALBUM,"This in all is an impressive album. Her debut shows that she has matured since then. Although her cover of Eternal's ""Angel of Mine"" although still a classic song does not reach the class of the original."
2,Not worth buying,"I keep wondering did Monica just release this CD so she wouldn't be out done by Brandy. The CD is too crossover for me, it's too many re-makes, and not enough R&B."
3,it's ok but you can tell she rushed it...,"the 1st 5 songs on this album were off the chain but as i got past those it was like, is this the new album or the old one? it seems like she just used the rejects from her first album.she could have made it better..."
4,This CD has no bad language it is good for younger listeners,The CD The Boy is Mine is a bundle of songs on friends and relationships. The vocals are very strong and the songs are very well writen. I believe that this CD is very much related to another artsts album Brandy's Never Say Never.
5,"This is Dorchester, Mass speaking up for that blazing DIVA","You are just the bomb girl I LOVE YOU AND YOUR music.All the songs are nice. But you really need to check out ""You say you love me .I come back with I hate you. It only takes me a day or two. To relize I'm in love with you."" So go out and rise this DIVA to the top where she belongs."
3,It grew on me,I am truly a fan of Monica's but I was displeased with the album when I bought it. After hearing it a few times the album began to grow on me. She still has the maturity in her voice that she had on the first album. She just needs better producers and writers. As far as comparing her and Brandy just leave it alone. They are two young females both doing positive things. Everyone has the tendency to speak bad about one or the other and both of them still need time to grow as artist and vocally. If you listen to the talents of both Tanya Blount and Lauryn Hill You can hear the difference in the maturity of these young artist and Brandy and Monica. So give it a rest and let these women entertain.
3,Not Bad Monica,"I think Monica is a great singer and I love her music. This album as a whole though, was sketchy. The lyrics to her songs weren't up to her level of singing. I think she could've changed her lyrics a little. Other than that, this is a album with some of her most recent great songs. I expected a little more from Monica."
5,AMAZING!!!!!,"Monica is truly the bomb!! I loved her first album, but this is even better. With songs like Angel of Mine, Right Here Waiting(with 112), and The First Night, I could listen to it 24-7. The only song that is merely alright is Gon' be fine, track #7. Keep up the great work, Monica."
5,Monica proved the Boy is truly hers,"Monica's voice is so much more soulful than Brandys, not that I don't like Brandy but Monica showed people what she could do on this album. I also think that Monica does'nt get enough credit as Brandy just because Brandy acts and sings. But just wait till she comes out with her movie Love Story."
4,it's a great cd,"I like Monica's ""The Boy is Mine"". She is one of the few R&B singers that I like. She has a good voice.""Street Symphony"" is a cool mellow yet danceable song. ""The Boy Is Mine"" is awesome! Monica and Brandy should definitely do another duet together.""The First Night"" has a good message and a cool beat. ""Angel of Mine"" is a sweet song. ""Take Him Back"" is awesome! I love the melody. ""'Cross the Room"" is awesome! Those are my favorite songs off of the album. Rock on!"
2,the first one had more promise,the problem for me is two things off the bat first the material is to polished and second her voice hasn't gotten to it's full growth.in one big statement she shouldn't be doing a brandy album.she is better than that.
3,Pretty Good Cd.,"I got Monica's cd because of the beautiful song entitled ""Angel of Mine."" I love that song! ""The Boy is Mine"" in my opinion is a boring song that goes on way to long. Most of the songs on this album have about the same tune and rythem, but ""Angel of Mine"" was worth spending the money on."
5,Surprise!,A lot of teenage singers lack the maturity that many of the selections here exhibit. I was impressed. Worth the money.
2,THIS IS A NUMBER ONE HIT BUT FOR YOU I WILL IS THE #1 HIT!!,ALL THESE SONGS WERE GREAT BUT I THINK THAT FOR YOU I WILL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE SAMPLES BECAUSE THAT IS THE SONG THAT ME AND NY BOYFRIEND DANCED OFF WHEN WE MET AND I REALLY LOVE THAT SONG AND I THINL THAT MONICA OUT DID HERSELF ON THIS SONG AND REALLY NEEDS TO KEP UP THE GREAT WORK.
1,"There are two good songs, the rest are just fillers and rema","I live in Europe, and I thought it was wrong of Monica to remake ANgel of Mine by Eternal one year after they scored the same hit. People in Europe were already tired of that song, so nobody really wanted to hear it again. A lot of the other stuff is remade too, like the song with 112 and Misty Blue. The two good songs are The Boy is Mine and First Night which are readily available on the internet. I love For you I will too, but i had the Space Jam soundtrack from 96, and that song was a filler too. I like her voice, but sometimes it seems like she is trying to be the best vocalist in the world with ""Star Search/Talent Show""-esque quality vocal runs, except sometimes they dont fit in with the song. As for her image, you can see the combination of anorexia and too uch makeup dont work."
2,"Has more talent, however this CD did'nt reflect it.",tHE Boy Is Mine only had two good songs on it. The rest of the CD was horrible. I got bored with it on the first day it was bought. You would be better off buying the singles instead of the whole album. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
3,Could have been better!,"Monica can sing but she doesn't sing from her soul and it makes all of her songs sound horrible. When she did that duet with Brandy I thought Brandy was the better singer because she stands out more. ""The First Night"" on her album was my favorite and I wish her luck and hope she succeeds in this business."
3,eh,"This album is okay, but I like Brandy's better. Mase is on hers! Sheesh. Go with the Brandy CD is your mostly looking for the Boy is Mine. Angel of mine is a cool song."
5,This CD is awesome,First of all Monica is a lot hotter than Brandy. Brandy with her fat f**king hips and she can also sing millions of times better brandy will be on that show where are they now or something like that
1,not even worth a star,i bought the album thinking it was going to be good but i liked her first album not her 2nd one because she only has to good songs..what that brandy wrote and the first night. i like monica but her singing got 5 million times worse
5,Monica's is so FINE!!!!,"And she has matured, this album proves it. Monica is the phattest singer I've heard in a while(besides Faith). This album is full of cuts like the creative ""Street Symphony""and the duet with Brandy""The Boy Is Mine"". You gotta buy this one."
2,It wasn't to good.,"I just got the cd and personally I didn't like it as well as her first cd.I like Monica a lot and she can sing well, but I just did not like it.I've been waiting a long time for it and it was kind of a disapointment."
2,Could be better!!,"This CD is okay. Personally I could live without having it. I am the type of person who isn't really into slow songs and this CD is full of 'em. Although ""Angel of Mine"" and ""Cross tha room"" are really good jams. If your more into dancin' you can live without this one."
4,This cd is slamming,"For past Monica fans, they will not be disappointed in her new album. The songs are maturer, her voice stronger, and the choice of songs definitely show that she is more adult-orineted. Her vocal range on two Diane Warren penned songs, ""Inside,"" and ""For You I Will,"" truly show Monica has lasting talent in the r&b music world. One of the best songs on the album is a cover of the Richard Marx song ""Right Here Waiting,"" with background vocals performed by 112. Pick up this cd, its definitely worth money!!!"
2,terrible,"this c.d. is truly a waste of money people please keep your money in your pocket. trust me brandy, mya,shanice c.d. are much better..."
2,"Monica's cd, ""The Boy is Mine"" is not her best work!!","Monica's cd is not her style or what we were used to in the past. It doesn't seem to have a common theme througout the cd. Unfortunately, she failed to add her own personal touch to her music. For example, Brandy's cd reflects her personality and what she feels all the way from beginning to end. Monica's cd is music and lyrics that reflect someone elses personality and feeling. The music isn't very up beat and it seems kind of sad. I was very disappointed in her vocally and musically. If this is all we have to look forward to from Monica, she should have left things alone with her first cd ""Miss Thang"" - Alisha"
4,A good cd that leaves you wanting more,"Monica is a very talented artist and this album definitely makes everyone want to hear more songs from her. After listening to this incredible cd, I can wait to hear more albums by her. She's definitely got a lot of talent and I'm glad she has put it to great use!"
3,Could be better . . .,"I say, stick to the first album and you won't go wrong. I was terribly disappointed at this one and I am a big fan of Monica. It's sad how people who compared her to Brandy and said she had a better voice found out that the material on this album stinks, regardless of how nice her voice is. Her new slow jams (except ""Ring da Bell"") lack the ghetto-soul of ""With You"" and ""Let's Straighten it Out."" I hope that the 3rd time's a charm as her label wisins up and realizes that her talent is far too advanced for such bland material."
2,It ain't all that!!!,"I recently bought Monica CD entitled ""the boy is mine."" Unfortunately, I am not please with it. Don't get me wrong, I think that Monica can sing her lungs off, but the songs are not ""catchy."" The only two songs that I could listen to again is ""The Boy is Mine"" and ""The First Night"" The rest are boring. Sorry Monica!!!!"
4,Monica is DA BOMB!,"I think that this CD is totally awesome! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 wuz becuz I thought her song ""Gone be fine"" was pretty weak. Over all, Monica is DA BOMB!!!! Buy this CD!!! If you're into R&B, you'll have NO REGRETS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,It's only ok,"I found this cd to be a little boring. I expected more of Monica. She has such a fabulous voice, and I think that more of the tracks should have better displayed her vocal skills. I mean, the girl can blow, but without the right songs and producers, it just won't happen."
1,"The talents, there but the songs are wack",I was a big fan of Monica when this album came out in 1998. But i was also in the 6th grade. Listening to it now it sounds so corny. The vocal are very good and she is very talented. But that talent doesn't shine through because the songwriters give her garbage material. The production is weak too. If she got some bangin songs she would have done fine. Also 3 of the songs are copied. How original. I havent heard after the storm but I hope its better.
2,SHE ACTS LIKE SHE IS BRANDY.,"MONICA'S 2ND ALBUM ""THE BOY IS MINE"" SOUNDS JUST LIKE BRANDY.""THE BOY IS MINE"" THE SINGLE F/BRANDY AND BRANDY IS WAY BETTER THEN MONICA.""ANGEL OF MINE"" IS NICE.BUY BRANDY CUZ SHE WAS THE 1ST AND MONICA JUST COPIED."
1,GIRL PLEASE!!!! A BLUE FEATHER BOA??,"Monica's first cd ""Ms. Thang"" rocked the house, I still listen to it in my car,....""here we are face to face, with the memories that cant be erased, although we need each other......"" ok anyways, the point is that I can feel her honesty in her voice, like(even at the ripe old age of 14)she was singing about life experiences. This new cd however reeks of misdirected voice lessons resulting in a nasal stuffy sound that went out with Dinah Washington, and Billie Holiday(both of whom she is not)!!! Don't buy this if you want a sound resembling ""I wanna get down but not the first night"". If you must touch the fire after seeing mama get burnt just buy ""Angel of mine"" as the single, and Brandys cd(much better on the whole) for ""The boy is mine"",(a must have)."
2,Pop Is Pop,"Is this chick 14? Is this the musical equivalent of kiddie porn? Maybe, maybe, she's just a black version of Brittany Spears, likely she'll disappear without a trace, but who knows. The long intros drove me batty."
2,"Monica is extremely talented, but buy the singles, the album","is weak. I guess it would be better to buy the album early when it first came out so you could already know the upcoming hits and cherish them, but now in July almost a year after its release, the rest of the album has no potential with weak ballads and dull up-tempo crap. Miss Thang was da bomb, I loved her voice back then, and the songs, this album is over-hyped, and over-rated. If you like Monica's style though, I would suggest Kelly Price's Soul of A Woman"
5,"The ""Simple & To-The-Point"" Review","Let's break this to you this way,This album includes the #1 singles:The Boy Is Mine (duet w/Brandy)The First NightAngel Of MineAlso includes:Street Symphony (best track on the album)Gone Be Fine (featuring OutKast)Right Here Waiting (featuring 112)Inside (Japanese-released single)You decide."
3,It was okay but I like Brandy better!!,I liked your CD but I kinda like Brandy a little better. Don't take it hard but it's true. I like your voice too.My favorite song is that boy is mine. You girls are so fly!!!! See ya later!
2,"It was only good for some songs, the rest sucked",Monica is a good artist but she is not as good as brandy because she doesn't have the groove to her other songs that aren't popular.I own brandy and monica's cds. personally i think monica has some work to do.
3,Could have made a better CD!!,"Lots of the songs were tight, but most of them were a little too slow. The First Night was a cool song, and Monica should have made more of her songs like that. Speed it up girl! But the CD wasn't horrible, and she has a wonderful, strong voice with lots of talent."
3,"Girl, you could have done sooo much better!","This album does have it's high points, like Street Symphony, TBIM, First Night, Inside, and I keep it to Myself. However, the rest of the songs are pretty bland and she could use some seroius voice training. Everyone says her voice is so great but it really has no range and it's like she can't sing a single line without putting at least ten runs in it. Overall, the album is decent, but with people like Clive Davis backing her she should have a much better album."
4,One song makes the cd worth buying !,"Monica has a beautiful voice, I love to hear her sing. The song ANGEL OF MINE makes the cd worth buying."
3,She Can Sing- But This Isn't From Her Heart,"I know Monica can do better than this CD. I mean, Ring 'da Bell and Street Symphony were jst totally lame. The only three good Monica-like-diva-status songs are Angel of Mine (truly from the heart) For You I Will and The Boy is Mine. Not every one of her songs has to be passionate and deep 'cause it's always fun to have five cool, funky upbeat songs but this is just mindless singing. I agree with the other girl that Monica needs to have good songwriters but I disagree with her that Monica couldn't come close to Brandy. Brandy's voice is sooooo much better. Monica is a very good singer and she does have talent but this CD is just OK. Get the Angel of Mine single and Brandy's CD, Never Say Never or go for the queen of all singers plus experience, Mariah Carey. Monica can sing better pop/R&B than this."
1,What happened Monica?,"Monica can sing, but what was she singing? Next time take your time and come up with quality songs instead of trying to keep up with your competition. If you're not ready to come out with your album yet, WAIT!"
1,WHY MONICA WHY?????,"Monica is definetly a lot more capable of producing a better alblum, she done it with Miss Thang. Monica CAN BE compared to Brandy because she definetly has the voice, along with the beauty and the skills to be able to compete with her, it just that her writers are AWFUL and that reflects on Monica. She has the capability to blow Brandy out of the water if she had talented writers. The lyrics do not have the credibility that it should. Monica is very talented and it is ashamed that no one wants to bring it out. I can give Monica my loyalty she deseves as a fan, but she has got to produce something worth listening to or else the talent that was given to her by god Will go to waste."
2,overproduced and overrated,"This hit record is as good an example as any of everything that is wrong with contemporary r&b; while there is no question that Monica has singing talent, it's all for naught here. The two big problems here are (1.) the production, which like so much else these days, is over done to the point of being much less appetizing than it might be, and (2.) the songs, which are hokey, cliched, and the product of a write-a-hit-song-by-the-numbers approach. It's a pity, because had this young talent been born a generation earlier, and been recording songs by great talents like Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and been accompanied by more soulful musicians, who knows what she might have been capable of. Greatness, perhaps."
5,Monica's back in style!,"What can you say? A total of eleven creative and excellent songs which are a huge improvement from her last albulm. This time, her ""sassy"" personality is augmented through songs like The First Night and Cross the Room. Her partnership with Brandy, which brought forth the hit song the Boy is Mine, is also a key to the sucess that will emerge in the near future. Two thumbs up!"
5,"A great book for anyone who wants to ""GROW.""","I purchased WOLF'S book in 1993 and I have read it many times. Being a professional speaker in Canada I have used some of his great material in my motivational seminars. The book is easy to read and I recommend it for any person who wants to grow as an even better person.Today I ordered another of his books: THE SIX SUCCESS STRATEGIES FOR WINNING AT LIFE, LOVE & BUSINESS."
5,pretty good,this is pretty good. the lights and sound are cool but tthe power is bad. and it looks good too.
2,A movie with complete lack of realism,In my opinion Kaante would have been a complete disaster if it wasn't for the Hollywood style fight scene and a good song. The entire movie revolves around a heist in an American bank and the problems the various characters had to face in dividing the money and finding a police informant amidst them. Director Sanjay Gupta did a splendid work with the action sequences but as the plot advances it simply became a typical boring movie
4,DVD's,The Broken Vows DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition. I thoroughly enjoyed viewing the DVD. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys mysteries with some romance included.
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Furry space soft pr0n.Or, if you are eight years old and pick this one up for 25c expecting cheesy SF, you will get that and perhaps a little more of a surprise, as well.Basically your amorous flyboy style of novel adapted to a science fiction setting and kept somewhat tame, although note as tame as some of those."
1,atrocious,"The idea of crowley being resurrected is interesting, but this film presents the worst possible cliches About Aleister Crowley and throws some others in too. It's definitely just a mild entertainment for people who don't know anything about crowley and are happy to keep it that way. I guess it's always better that way - more esoteric, more occult! :-)."
2,weak,"do what thou... god damn it, shut up already!Simon Callow was great and some of the female nudity was really good, but this movie felt uneven and deeply flawed from the get-go. no big plot, too many cliches, unnecessary indulgences like trying to fit all of Crowley's wickedness into 100 minutes.the script really needed a huge edit before filming took place. maybe a different director too. at times, it was just confusing and boring... boring? how could a movie based on The Beast be boring? well, somehow it was.as a Left Hand Path occultist and film fanatic, i can't really recommend this movie, sadly. too bad. someone has to do Crowley justice!ia ia,Venger As'Nas SatanisCult of Cthulhu High Priest"
3,crowley,it was what i expected maybe someone should tell paul ryan that anne rand sorta liked the old demon master?
3,The Great Beast would not be impressed...,"Full marks to Bruce Dickinson for making a feature film on Crowley, but it is tacky. Simon Callow puts in a brilliant performance as a character based on Crowley. There are some funny plays on words which Crowley readers will enjoy, like the ZX 93 computer, Haddo being a Crowley nom de plume, etc.Crowley wasn't quite that beastly and although he loved to dress up in weird costumes, I don't think his tastes stretched to that appalling pink suit! I don't recall that ever peed of his audience or left excrement as a calling card.All very amusing in a Hammer horror sort of way, but don't expect a serious portrayal of the Master Therion."
2,Crowley did what???,"Crowley is shown as a murderer of young women.A person who likes to urinate and deficate in public.And generally, not being a nice person. Everyone who knew him in real life,said he personelly was not a easy person to get along with socialy. Crowley was a master magickian/philosopher,expert mountain climer,master chess player,world traveler and adventurer,prolific writer,poet.A user of drugs and sex(to expand his consciousness);a fact open to legitamate debate.But primarily he is known as the greatest occultist of the 20th century.And as leader of the Rosicrucian(not satanic)Thelemic Ordo Templi Orientis(O.T.O.) If Crowley was alive today.He would take great delight in sueing the pants off the producers of this tale of rubbish. ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law""...Love is the law,Love under will"". Sincerely William Carney"
3,Downdraft,"I, too, enjoyed this movie mostly because of Vincent Spano. My teens loved the action, and the boys especially liked Kate Vernon. I loved the cast in this movie, although a little corny, but entertaining. Again, Mr. Spano is a most underrated actor."
2,Not as good as Etymotic,"I've used these earplugs for the last couple of concerts I've gone to (rock/indie/electronica) and I noticed that they attenuate high frequencies more than the Etymotic Research ER20's, which is why I like the ER20's better. If you're looking for level attenuation across frequencies, these aren't as good, although if you're looking to knock down the highs (but less than foam earplugs do), these will do."
1,Not For Everyone,"I have no doubt the problem is the shape of my ear canal and not the device. I was at an exercise class which pumps loud music, I did not notice any difference between having the plug in or out. Just to get the plugs to stay in my ear, I had to push it in further than I wanted.I have had issues with other ear plugs, so my advice is if you had problems with other plugs or earpieces stay away from this and go with the foam."
5,El mejor disco dedicado a la bomba y plena que tengo,"Lo bueno de este disco es la variedad. Ciertas canciones son bomba tradicional, mientras que en otras le han an~adido metales dandole un sonido de orquesta. Tambien es lo mismo con la plena. Algunas completamente percusivas, otras con mas instrumentos.El sabor aqui es puro Puerto Rico. Si pudiese tenes solo un disco de bomba y plena, seria este."
5,Beautiful treefrog seat covers.,"I am completely delighted with my new seat covers. Not only are they beautiful and unusual, but they were very easy for me to install. I'm 78 yrs and hate calling on someone to help me. I had never installed seat covers before, but it was a breeze. I plan to order more frog items in the near future."
4,Cute!,"I really liked the whole theme thing, but I can't give it 5 stars because #1, I have a teen, raising a lamb right now, and every bit of wood shavings from her lambs pen gets on my car seats and mats :( #2. I have a dog with WHITE fur that has the back of the seat covers pretty furry fast :( #3. They're kindda hot in the hot California sunshine... but I LOVE the froggies!!! And they were easy to install... and my car looks so neat, when they're clean :)"
4,Little Better than Expected,"Bought this sub for my secondary home theater (the one in the family room that the wife and I share; the high-power THX system's in the basement...!), and just wanted a little extra 'punch' to regular TV viewing. I have a Sony 7.1 receiver with a dedicated sub-out and after adjusting the output settings, I'm very pleased with this little sub. The wife even asked me to ""please turn that thing down"", after watching an HD action movie on Showtime. I did, but I'm still pleased with the low-frequency response. For an under-$100 powered sub, it does all I wanted it to for the application/room that it's in."
5,Excellent choice,"I went for this one based on all good reviews that i read in the blogs, and was not disappointed.Great subwoofer in the given price range (under 150$) for a 18*12 living room with Bose speakers."
4,Sony SA-W2500 Great value!,"This box in an excellent value. I have it in a mid-sized room and it does a fine job of filling the room will deep, balanced base.Highly recommended."
2,Very Muddy,"Nice speaker, not for a big room though. The bigger the room the more muddy it will be. It's more of a bedroom speaker, but it's Sony so you can't expect perfection."
2,Not good enough,"The sound at medium to high volume was fine. At 35% of volume or lower on my Onkyo receiver the auto detect didn't work. If I turned the volume up, auto detect would pick up the signal. When I turned the amp down it would shut off within a minute or two. I tried it with multiple movies and types of music and it never work at 35 or lower. I had to return it."
1,Not happy with sound.,I bought this for two reason good reviews and price. Will I returned the speaker after 2 days. I could never get much bass sound out of the woofer. I tried everything. The bass sound was very weak. I would not buy this product. Go with the Polk system PSW10 I did I have much better sound.
5,Great,It sounds good and I have not had any problem with it.The fact that I do not have to get up and turn it on every time I turn on my entertainment system makes it great.It comes on as soon as a sound goes through it.And turns off if there is no sound input.Good product I love it.Sony SA-W2500 Performance Line 100 Watt Subwoofer
5,Nice subwoofer,good sound in my home theater system. Right price and quality. This speaker is heavy! I would recommend it highly.
4,Great Buy,"I use this subwoofer in my livingroom. I don't have a massive system. I have 2 Boston acoustic speakers, a decent reciever and this Sub. I get plenty of bass and boom for all of the movies i watch and the music i listen to. Unless you just want to spend a lot of $ and get the best out there, there's no need to spend more.This is well worth the money."
5,AWSOME BUY!!!!!!!,"For it's size it packs a real punch.My home theater has never sounded so good, since I added this unit. Love it! Arrived earlier than I expected. I couldn't be happier."
5,Works for me,"I am not an expert on sound reproduction and only have a simple surround system set up for my TV and Blue Ray , using a Pioneer Elite Reciever. This Subwoofer has given a totaly new Dimension to the sounds I am hearing. I never new there were some sounds in my movies until I set up my System. I know the reciever is the main part, but the speakers are just as important. The Bass is great and the speaker shuts down into standby when not recieving a signal. You can control volume from the speaker so as to give yourself the amount of bass you want.The size was a little big, but I managed to position it in a not too obtrusive place.I am very happy with this speaker."
3,"works, but not a boomer","if your looking for booming base, this is not for you. i was disapointed. it works but rather weak."
5,GREAT!! EXCELLENT!!!!,"When I purchased this amazing sub, I knew it would work out great for me and my economical built media/theater room. I seen this sub listed @ Amazon, I researched and looked for other reviews outside of amazon and ran across that Best Buy sells the exact same one. So I traveled to the nearest Best Buy and tested it out and it was out of thid world! I decided to purchase through amazon because the price is ALOT LOWER! than Best Buy. Once it came in and I connected to my Harman Cardon 635 AVR 7.1 receiver, WOW! WOW! WOW! This thing sounds great!!!! It gives you the right amount of low end from movies and as well the rumbles, and heavy breathing in movies! You can't beat the amount of quality for the dollar! I'm just taking AWAY!!!!!!! I cant believe I paid this less of money for a brand new sub woofer! Also I have them working along Audio Acoustics 6 inch movie theater speakers and center channel, which also sounds GREAT!!!!!"
5,Awesome for the money,You can't beat this sub-woofer for the price..I am a professional sound engineer..I added this sub to my home system..its great...you can adjust the cross over..from 50 hz.-200 hz. cut-off..it sounds great with my high-end Altec Lansing three ways..I am buying a second one for sure!
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I'm no pretentious audiophile, but I love my movies and my music. I gave this sub a shot based on the reviews and the fact that I was on a REAL tight budget; I'm going to have to split with the crowd on this one: If all you want is RUMBLE, then this is the ticket. It is literally a Boom box. HOWEVER, a subwoofer is not just supposed to make the walls shake - it's supposed to accurately reproduce low frequency sound. this is important for listening to music. The Sony did not do this for me. I played with the crossover settings, volume, and placement. I ended up leaving it on extremely low settings because all it was good for was rumbling. It was not tight, and did not really fill in low frequencies until cranked - which of course just meant lots of boom boom boom.If all you want is cheap rumble for your HT then this may work, but if you also want accurate, tight bass for your music (and really, a decent sub should be able to do both), then look elsewhere."
4,A sub is a sub,"I think this is a good entry-level subwoofer. Nicely packaged, easy to set up. Overall a good unit.Only gave 4 stars because the rubber feet included with the sub are pathetic. I bought an extra package of rubber feet which are a lot nicer and help prevent vibration issues."
1,"Not Good, and I'm no audiophile","Bought this to replace my old Kenwood 10"" 100W sub which performed well for years but finally bit it. This unit had similar specs but when I hooked it up it barely put any sound out, even after running through the automatic speaker setup on my Pioneer tuner. I had to crank up the signal to the sub to get any sound out of it and even then the sound was notably muddy. Like I said I'm no audiophile but even I was disappointed with this unit enough to eat the $19 to ship it back."
2,Pile of Blown Subs,I have blown 3 of these. 2 in the last 3 months. I advise not keeping it at the max level all the time as this seems to be the cause of it blowing
1,Sent it back,"I sent this subwoofer back. I have a Sony receiver so I thought a matching subwoofer would provide the best quality sound. I only watch Discovery, History, Science, news channels so my requirement was something that was middle of road for the occasional movie.I tried seveal recently relased action, science fiction, stuff that was 5.1 but I never got a peeop out of the thing. I set it up to the recommended settings on both the subwoofer and the receiver. I'm going to spend a little more money and get someting that at least provides some since of bass."
5,Fantastic!!!,"I bought this sub, after I found out I needed a powered sub for my Sony recevier. This is my first actual home theater system and this sub completed it! It's a great buy if you mostly watch movies or play games. I haven't played music through it yet, but it should work just fine. The sub, recevier and my 42"" plasma will eventually go to my room when I get a house and get my DLP, but for now it's fantastic!"
5,Solid performance/compact size,I wanted a subwoofer to compliment an audio system that I have in my home office (16ft x 11 ft). The compact cube size fits nicely in small spaces. This subwoofer delivers solid bass response at low to medium program listening levels. It would also work well with a small/medium sized room home theater system.
4,Sony woofer,Works well. Base at the level I need in this room. Not too loud - not to soft - just right. The first shipment I received was crushed in original packaging. I was forced to return and wait another week. The return process went well with Amazon.
4,"Boom, boom, Sony's here","This baby performs very well and sports a myriad of audio input connectors. Since I'm only using it for a second sub-woofer, I've split the pre-amp input out of my receiver to this and another subwoofer. But there's also a wide assortment of input-output connectors, showing that Sony engineers gave some serious design consideration here. IMHO, the case isn't particularly attractive but since most of us won't be displaying our subwoofer as a piece of furniture, that's okay by me. At any rate, this bad boy has an excellent price-performance ratio."
3,Nice addition,"This subwoofer works well and adds a lot of lower end to my stereo system. It can be a tad boomy on some pieces, but is easily adjusted."
5,Great value,"A great sub, I added this to a ""simulated surround-sound"" soundbar (Yamaha) with a Samsung flat screen, in a large family room, and while its not perfect surround sound, it does the job (and very neat), and the auto on and off feature is very handy. Good thumping bass. Highly recommended in this price range, unless you're a total audiophile."
5,"excelent choice I made , sounds great , good price","I thought it was going to be the same experience as with other subwoofers I had in the past , but hey its much better I love this , sound is awsome , clear and gets my movies sounding better than in the theaters"
3,OK for inexpensive subwoofer,Clumsy to turn on and off because the power switch is at the bottom back of the unit. Make sure you have clear access wherever you put this. Otherwise it's OK. I wanted an inexpensive subwoofer and this works adequately for my movie watching. Plenty of power. It fills our large great room/kitchen area with its 17-foot ceilings.
4,"Nice sound, great value.","My previous subwoofer was an unpowered one that was part of a HTIAB package. For the price, this powered subwoofer is a great bargain, and provides decent bass for the medium-sized room where it is. My only complaint is with the power-saver feature (which can be disabled). If the volume level is low (and thus the signal to the sub is low), the subwoofer tends to shut itself off automatically. It's certainly possible that at low levels, my Onkyo receiver doesn't put any low level signal out to the subwoofer, which would cause the sub to power off. The simple solution is to turn off the power-save feature, and manually power on and off the subwoofer, which is what I do now."
3,Decent subwoofer for the money.,"I've never owned a subwoofer before, but once I set up my new 50"" plasma HDTV, I wanted to add this component to complete the home theater experience. Although I don't have anything to compare this unit to, I can't help but feel just a little disappointed. I was expecting some big booms, and instead I'm getting moderate booms. My friend thought it made a big difference, but it feels like a little difference to me. Having said all that, I don't regret the purchase (for $90). Those moderate booms while watching a movie in high def do make the experience a better one.Very easy to set up and use, looks good too. I didn't like the clicking of the auto-off/on feature so I don't use it.If you're an AV enthusiest you're likely to be disappointed with this subwoofer. But if you're just looking for a little extra bass at a good price, then go for it."
4,Good for the money,I almost returned this sub since it didn't seem to be much louder than my old 50 Watt. I finally read the instructions and found that I had the frequency set wrong on the back of the woofer. After dialing that in correctly it started shaking the floor. Happy now :) Auto off takes a few seconds to wake up the sub... That might suck for movies so turn that off before the movie starts.
5,Good for budget,"My neighbor just interrupted me while watching 'the A-Team'. He said his place was rumbling and politely asked me to turn it down. Mind you we are NOT in a condo or shared apartment or something. Yes, we have grass separating our places. Needless to say, I was disappointed because I had to turn it down. Just isn't like the movie theater with the sound too low. However, for a budget system this sub is pretty good. Especially for the price. Sometimes bigger is better but if your mainly using for movies and you don't have a 25' X 25' room you should be fine. I have used better sounding subs before, but not for under $100 for sure! I bought a HTIB a few years ago that came with a 10"" sub(sony brand, hence i wanted something to match). I found that the HTIB sub wasn't adjustable and not very adequate. To make my system sound great, I bought a $3.00 Y adapter and have both subs hooked up, one on either side of the room. Sounds way better and fills the room a lot better also."
4,Sony Boom 100,"I'm not one for brand consistency, but time it was worth it. I've recently purchased a Sony A/V receiver and a Sony LCD HDTV. So far so good. But was going to opt for another brand speaker system, most audiophiles would let you know that this is where it all counts. My budget got tight so I decided I would get a Sony self powered sub-woofer. I've never purchased or used a self powered sub-woofer before. I'm the type that would buy passive speakers with an power amp to carry it. But this Sony showed me what I've been missing. It may not be the best sounding woofer, but for the price, the appearance and it's features, I have nooo complaints. (I'm still a mix brand kind of guy)"
5,So far so good!,"Purchased this subwoofer in mid December. It was simple to set up and easy to use. Really adds to the sound system. I have it in a fairly large basement home theater and its plenty powerful. So far, no complaints."
2,good starter sub for small room,its a good starter sub for building a system or for a bed room it performs well at lower levelsetting for volume and at under 120 hz if you turn the volume up to much you will get some distortion quickly.ive got a bic sub on order to replace my sony unit and will be using the sony hooked up to my back surround speakers till it blows up.ive had some issues with it failing to turn on and had to slap the cabinet to get it to start .warrenty is over so its my problem.this makes a good starter unit its a good deal for the money but the bass isnt really tight its muddy but for 100.00 you cant expect top preformance.if you keep the volume at med to low settings and the by pass low 100 to 120 it works ok .
4,Adds depth to movie soundtracks,"Nice rumble! If you have a good pair of floorstanding speakers with decent bass you probably don't need a sub, or you'll need one more powerful than this, but it worked out perfectly for me paired with the SSF-5000s."
4,"Wow, it's amazing !",What a difference a subwoofer can make.I rate 4 star because the refurbished oneis not as new as described. But it works really great when I hookedit with my YAMAHA HTR-6030SL!
4,When used with a large screen TV,"I have a Sony large screen HDTV and wanted to add base to the native speakers. In short the 100 watt subwoofer sounds great with actual HDTV programing, probably due to its digital audio feed; but it is anemic with regular programs. Wish I had considered the 150 watt unit instead. Then my wife could yell at me more often to turn the volume down."
3,silk,"They keep talking about the silk trade from Mexico, but no silk or any kind of material show up in the whole movie?"
1,Who are they talking about?,"As with another book I reviewed (Tradition, Opinion, and Truth: The Emerging Church of Christ by Fred Peatross), I don't recognize the churches of Christ that the authors are writing about. Even after thirty years of being a part of the churches of Christ I know that I am not an expert or possess a thorough knowledge of all the teachings but this book left me confused. The gist of the book seems to be that the CoC needs to reject the philosophies and teachings of our fathers and accept the postmodern worldview in order to grow and change along with the world. Not the Biblical teachings of our fathers but the traditions and ideals that they espoused and which have been a part of the churches of Christ for the past 150+ years. Oddly one teaching I do know is that we are taught not to be conformed to this world (Rom 12:2). The author's seem to have missed this one. This is a book that I will not be keeping. Perhaps I misread it but I don't believe so."
3,Seeing is believing,"I'm waiting for winter to end before I call an electrician to install this light. Cold hands make sloppy work. Anyway if its like one I already have then it will be great. Here's the thing. FEDEX dropped the ball on the shipping experience. Kept me home all day waiting and it didn't come. Didn't know when it would be delivered. Then arrived and I wasn't home and the vendor required a signature, you figure the rest if you have dealt with FEDEX."
3,"Poor build quality, but good functionality","As the manual says, sensor picks up motion going sideways to the fixture rather than towards it.Build quality & packaging is really poor. I had to return it once as it had a broken glass panel. The metal sidings are thin enough to bend with the slightest pressure while putting up the fixture.Fixture doesn't align very well at the top with the ceiling, you will need to buy sealing putty separately.Doesn't come with bulbs either. For the price, they should have."
1,Waste of time.,"We had a licensed electrician install this. Was junk, worked one day and died. Replacement coming but too much trouble. Do not buy is my suggestion."
5,Heath Zenith overhead sensor light,Delivery was in advance of initial offered delivery. Light performs as expected. Reduced sensitivity is wanted and is delivered. Looks is very acceptable. Installation is same as any new fixture.
1,Broken on arrival,"Order was placed and I received both lights in great time... But when I opened both packages the lower glass was cracked on both the original and the replacement...Perhaps better package from MFG and better quaility control, packing from Amazon would have made this an excellent purchase... I think I will try to find this product locally and hopefully better success..."
4,Backporch Light,I purchased this light for my back porch. When I leave it on high sensitivity it stays on all the time. I recently adjusted it to medium. I use it primarily when I let my dog out. Sometimes it takes several seconds to click on. Other times it clicks off when my dog is in the yard (I don't have a big yard)-even when she is moving around. It works great if you are standing on the porch and I think if you buy it for security purposes it would be fine.
4,Perfect,"The casual observer would never guess this is a motion activated light which makes it a perfect addition to any home. Easy to install, flexible settings, and optional override gives you everything you need. I installed it and had it working great in about 15 minutes. I'll never have to fumble around in a dark carport again."
1,Good while it lasted but only lasted a month,"The light looks pretty decent, the reviews were great, but mine stopped working 2 days after the ""return window expired""! The light comes on when I flick the switch manually to reset the mode, but then goes off after a few minutes and picks up no motion after that. Would've hoped for it to last at least a few years. Now I gotta deal with calling the manufacturer to figure out the issue."
5,"have it in three colors, lol is it tinted or not tinted got both lol",i have over 2000 HOTS AND HAVE A LOT OF ? IF ANY 1 CAN AWNSER THEM GIVE ME A HIT AT INSERRAJ@YAYOOH.C0M I WHOULD LOVE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT IVE GOT LOL......
5,So glad I own this....,"Every time I thought to try to get tickets to the live show, they were sold out by the time I called. Poor timing and planning on my part - but when I heard they were coming out with the DVD, I was one of the first ""in line"" so to speak here to get it. The DVD is fantastic, very good quality filming, etc. The show itself is a real attention grabber. Even my son, who has no clue of the deep history of the Steelers, loved the show. Enough can't be said about Tom Atkins in his role, he was simply brilliant."
1,Poor Video Quality,"Video froze @ 10 minute mark - started again @ 12 minute mark, then froze completely @ 1 hour 20 minutes."
5,Thoroughly Entertaining,If you are a Pittsburgh Steeler fan you must see this movie. The Rooney stories are priceless. I was thoroughly entertained for two hours.
3,You Get What You Pay For,The price is right for what you get here. The product comes in a cheapo blow molded case. The actual driver set is constructed of aluminum. The tooling itself looks like it was machined ok but probably won't last forever because it's made from aluminum but the plus side to that is that the tool will be softer than the race your driving in and hopefully won't damage it. If I could do it over again I would have spent more money for a nicer kit.
4,Good quality,"Item was as described. Can't see why they want so many words in the this description, as I said, it's a basic tool, just better than the plastic ones."
4,A great buy,"Round Two with this bike computer. The first one I bought worked well enough for a few years until I accidentally snipped the wire when I was trying to move it to a different bike (whoops!). Sometimes it was finicky and if you didn't know what you were doing when going through the menus you could really mess things up, but after getting acquainted with it for a few months I got the gist of it.For the price this thing can't be beat! While I've owned some more expensive wireless bike computers, I like the simplicity in this one; it just works!For just access to basic functions (speed, distance, time, etc) look no farther than this. If you want more information from your rides (heart rate, cadence, etc) then look elsewhere."
5,great product,"Does everything as advertised. I have used this little computer every day for two months, logging over 200 miles, and it works just fine. I will probably buy another one if this one goes bad after a year."
4,Worthwhile Tool!,"The Schwinn 20-Function Bike Computer is terrific. Among all of the functions this computer does I most appreciate the speedometer, the clock and knowing my distance and this Schwinn works great. Excellent value."
2,Too Small,"I bought this product thinking it was going to be much bigger form the pictures but i was disappointed to find out it was really small (size of a quarter), and the one i received didn't work properly at all so i returned it."
2,I Paid for this?,"This is sweet! It matches the color of my Schwinn bike! Other than that, it pretty much sucks!! Instructions, kinda confusing. Installation, easy but ugly with the zip-ties. Function, complicated...Galaxy S3 now used. Save money and use your phone. If no smart phone, google your distance and check your watch for times! Blah Blah Blah"
1,Item arrived dead.,"I was excited to put this on my vintage exercise bike since the needle had broken off the original speedometer. I got it out, inserted the battery, and it flashed for a second, never to turn back on again. I checked to make sure the battery was placed properly (it was), reinserted several times, but to no avail. I will be getting the CatEye computer that is on my mountain bike. this one has lots more features, but it's no good if it doesn't work!I am returning it. Should have paid attention to other people who said they didn't get good ones."
3,"Burn the instructions, read the reviews, then buy it","As others have noted, the instructions are worse than useless - they lead you entirely in the wrong direction, and don't tell you what you need to know. Instead, burn them, then follow the instructions provided by other reviewers - the sensor must be mounted on the *inside* of the front fork so it faces completely inward, and the round screw for the magnet needs to be facing out. (The picture in the instructions is entirely unclear what direction what direction the magnet should face.)Anyway, once you get it working, seems like a nice enough product.FOLLOW-UP: I sent an email request to their customer service when I was trying to figure out what the problem was. That was Oct 17. I just now (Dec 1) got a response. Good thing I wasn't in a rush!It works fine, but the installation instructions are probably the worst I've seen... makes those horrible Ikea instructions look clear!"
4,Recommended for good bike computer for good price,"Ordered the Schwinn 17 function bike computer for riding around neighborhoods. Timer, distance, and speed work great. Speed/distance can be ""tweeked"" by using a GPS and adjusting tire size if desired, but entering in the recommended setting for you tire size is fairly close. I do not find the back light that helpful. The light works well so you can see, but shuts off automatically to save battery life. When activated, it freezes the display, I would prefer it to cycle through the scan values, then turn off. Everything else has worked great. This is a wired system so you don't have to worry about interference."
4,Does what it says,This was my first Bike computer. It does what it says. No problems. After a while I decided to go for a more complete one.Good for starters that are not sure about spending money.
4,"Works fine, cheap, has function to input odometer miles","I thought it was great, except for the spoke magnet. If you have thick spokes or flat blade spokes, its fine, but for thin spokes you need to buy a conventional spoke magnet (metal kind with screw). This computer comes with a little plastic one that can be adjusted by hand, but may not be secure on thin spokes.For $10, I happily bought 2 of them for my bikes. Good deal."
5,"FANTASTIC buy, Works great, easy to read, VALUE","I LOVE this bike computer. It was easy to set up. I love being able to see the time and speed at the same time. Mostly i just use it for the time, speed, and distance functions, but it does these great. I haven't been able to check the accuracy of the speed and distance features but the seem to work. I'm really happy with this especially for the price!"
2,Installation process is horrible!,"The reason why i gave this 2 stars is becuase of the entire installation process. The sensor must be 1mm away from the magnet but not touching! Thats basically impossible, i had to mess around with it for over an hour to get it that close. It works fine now, thank god. I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone any age. Especially a child who will cry to his/her parents complaining about how this thing doesnt work. Buy any other brand and save yourself time and frustration."
1,It won't work at all,"The QC of this product is really bad.When I put the battery in, it couldn'tbe set to the correct wheel code.I will never buy any product from thiscompany."
1,does not clear after a bike trip,"This piece has calorie & fat counter. But you cannot clear it after you ride bike. I want to see the calories/fat counter when I ride, my husband does not. It just keep adding so you have to write the numbers down before and after your trip. Not impressed with this at all."
1,How fast am I going?,"All the features work great except the speedometer, witch was the only reason that I bought the thing.Do you think a thirteen year old kid can ride sixty miles per hour under his own power?I got my dad to drive along side me to see how fast I was really going.It turns out I am only going thirty miles per hour. I do not recommend getting this computer..."
1,Stopped working!,This bike computer was installed and worked for 32 miles. No matter how I adjust the magnet and sensor there is no reading. I have reset and replaced the battery all to no avail. I would not recommend this computer which is too bad because it has really nice features if it worked!
3,Sometimes less is more,"This the second bike computer I have owned. The directions are kind of complex. Also I am not sure how accurate it is. It also has a wire that has to be ran down the front fork, the wireless type are easier & cleaner."
4,Great item for a reasonable price,This speedometer works well. I did have some trouble getting the sensor lined up at first but it has not moved and works great. I did have to buy some additional zip ties to secure the wires properly. It is a great item I would buy it again.
3,more than what I had...less than I had hoped,"It lets me know how fast I'm going and how far I've gone - that is more than I had (which was nothing) before. Having said that, a reviewer that I read before buying the product made it sound as if everyone else was a little stupid for complaining about resetting the trip mileage - which is a pain when riding by the way - and that things like avg. mph would be reset by resetting the trip mileage to 0 (which has to be done a digit at a time). THIS IS NOT THE CASE and that guys review should not be a featured review as it is incorrect. The whole machine has to be reset to get a fresh avg mph - which means you have to input the wheel size, your weight etc. before each ride that you want an avg mph for...and you lose all of your previous data. Said all of that to say, it lets me know how fast I'm going at any given moment and how far I've gone...it's just not real convenient...did I mention that it's better than what I had before?"
5,Easily the best add-on to my bike,"If you have to choose to spend $20 on some add-on to your bike choose this.When installed CORRECTLY (which some people have problems with, just read the manual people!) this is a flawless bike computer. It tracks everything you could care about: distance, current speed, average speed, calories, and fat calories burned, etc. It also has a scan mode which rotates through these modes as you're biking so you can look down and see a lot of the data as it cycles (no pun intended) through it's list.This let's you bike smarter and with greater access to information corresponding to your overall bike workout. I strongly encourage the purchase of this product."
4,It is what it is for the price,"It's good. Works. Lots of functions. Would be better if it were wireless, but then it would cost more. It may be worth it to invest a few extra bucks and get a wireless one, but if this is your first and you're just getting a cheap computer to play with, this is your boy."
4,Great bike computer for the price,"For the price you can't beat it. Wanted a computer to let me know how fast I'm going, average speed, trip miles,total miles, trip time, current time, temperature and calories burned. It does all of this and very accurately too.Sure, you could spend more and get a better computer that is also wireless and maybe even has easier function controls. But for $10.00? Depends on how much you want to spend for the info."
3,Don't Lose the Instructions,"If you lose the instructions, it will be very difficult to use. Its not intuitive. If you make the mistake of resetting the entire thing, you may lose the tire size setting."
1,Stopped working after one week,"Computer worked fine for the first week. Then it stopped registering my speed, distance, etc. The battery was fine, as it still registered the time and temperature. But nothing came from the sensor. I tried remounting it numerous times, adjusting the sensor and the magnet numerous times, clearing it out and resetting all the functions numerous times. All with no results. A product should last more than a week. Spend the extra 10 or 15 and get a well made computer/"
1,Not worth it,"Bought based on largely postitive reviews. Main issue is that the mounting bracket is lousy. The computer flies off the handlebars very easily if you hit a bump. Ended up taping the unit to the bracket. After about a year the unit quit working altogether. Replaced with a Cateye wireless. Cost more, but is a far better design."
2,Worked great...for 3 weeks.,"It was simple to install and worked great, for 3 weeks. now it only reads 0.0 and shows my history. it turns on when i'm riding so i know the magnet is close enough for the sensor to pick it up, but there's either a loose connection in the wires or the battery is going bad (which it shouldn't in 3 weeks of minimal riding). so you get what you pay for with this one, and it's the cheapest one out there... enjoy!"
5,Great device for keeping track,"I have been using this Schwinn bike computer for a little over a month. I am very satisfied with it. I must confess the hardest part of it all is aligning the magnet with the sensor. This took me about 10 minutes which isn't really bad after all. All the instructions are clearly written. The information it gives you is accurate. I have compared the data it provides me with other methods of computing distance (e.g. data from google maps, etc)and I have found it to be accurate. I highly recommend this item. The price is the greatest part of it all !!! :)"
4,Can't beat it for the price,Great little computer for the price. I tested this against a GPS sport watch and the distance was spot on. It isn't completely intuitive to use so I find myself looking at the instructions more than I like but the learning curve should be short. I'm sure if you are a super serious biker then this probably wouldn't have everything you want but it is more than adequate for a novice like me. The size of my wheel wasn't listed in the chart so I had to do some calculations to come up with the correct diameter but that is easy enough. I bought two of these computers so that I could have one on my bike and on my husbands. It took some effort to get the magnets and sensor set correctly on the first bike but the second was simple. I highly recommend this product!
4,extremely pleased,This bike computer was very easy to setup and use. It attaches in minutes and the zip tie straps hold everything in place. it very easy to toggle between all the functions.
