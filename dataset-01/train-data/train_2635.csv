2,When a book sucks you find that they really like to bury the,"reviews as far down the page as possible. Well I don't care, I will still voice my opinion and say that: Although the author does offer a few (limited) insights, you can certainly do better elsewhere. Wake up and smell the coffe"
2,Simply not on a par with other HTML books.,"Although the book claims to focus on many other things beyond HTML, there's really not much substance beyond the coverage of HTML basics. There's only a single beginner chapter on CGI that doesn't really teach you much at all. Buy the book because you are looking for a book on the bare basics of HTML for a begginner and not because you need help with CGI or other Web stuff. For great coverage of HTML AND other Web technologies, you should definitely take a look at the professional reference edition of a book called Web Publishing Unleashed, which is in my humble opinion a much better choice and a much better value for your money"
2,Covers HTML Basics but NOT much else!,The book covers the basics fairly well but doesn't have the real substance that you need to create a winning Web site. For anyone that is just getting started consider this book but don't make it a priority. If you already knows the basics you should look elsewhere. My personal favorite for HTML books is HTML Java CGI VRML SGML Web Publishing Unleashed (yes I believe that's really the title). If you can afford it get the professional edition
2,Definitely NOT that great!,"This book professes to cover everything, and thatis hardly the case. If you want a book that truly covers everything, try Web Publishing UnleashedProfessional Reference. I love THAT book. This book, however, just didn't cut it. How can you cover a topic in a few paragraphs or a few pages and claim comprehensive coverage?"
1,Not a good alternative!,I was looking for another view on HTML but this book wasn't very good. Much of what the author talks about isn't clear and he confuses a lot of issues. No beginner should try this one that is for sure
2,"Splurge, get Stanek's Web Publishing Professional instead!",You'll be much happier and much more informed if you purchase Stanek's Web Publishing Unleashed Professional instead. I liked that book much much more than this one and its covers much much more as well
5,my classic legendary muscle cars,on viewing all six dvds i was very impressed on the knowledge that dennis cage has on all the vehicles being an owner of a 1975 dodge dart sport hang ten i must admit im more a mopar nut the information i have gained from the 1968 hemi dart has been very useful in my pursuit of the history of the dodge dart and the plymouth superbird and cuda have been long favourites of mine in closing i honestly say that the whole collection is worth the money and if you are an american car owner or enthusiat you will enjoy all the episodes i can highly recommend this set
3,gday,"I found it informative , but would have liked a little more information about the vehicles, still handy to know learnt a few things from it"
5,Great book!,"""Ecstasy Through Tantra"" has been my companion in spiritual work for the last several months. It is full of knowledge about Tantra and spirituality in general, explaining the esoteric meaning of numerous symbols in fascinating detail, describing magical rituals, and also offering practical exercises, particularly for couples who want to proceed on a spiritual path together. It is a relationship-friendly book, helping us to see our partners as divine beings, and introducing us to the wondrous world of sexual magic. The book contains many attractive illustrations, including ""The Asanas of Love"", and a whole set of chakra mandalas for contemplation and meditation. ""Ecstasy Through Tantra"" is a celebration of eroticism and sexuality in a spiritual context."
1,Ecstasy Through Tantra,"I found this book to have too much discussion and not enough instruction. I was looking for a variety of techniques, but found mostly a lot information about what tantra is. I am interested in achieving a tantric marriage, and this book did not do enough to teach me how."
1,Tantra & Sex - THE BIGGEST HOAX,"TANTRA HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SEX, IT HAS TO DO WITH OVERALL WELLBEING PHYSICALLY AND SPIRITUALLY thru yoga. People who combine TANTRA solely for SEX are ""SNAKE OIL"" Salesman trying to make fast bucks. I am from INDIA and have good knowledge of YOGA and all its branches (Pranayama, Hatha Yoga......).."
3,Only for the Sonata #3,"I cannot have the same enthusiasm than Edward regarding the performance of the Concerto for Piano and String in this recording... Gothoni brushes over the work, reminiscent of the Bis recording with Pontinen. Despite its interpretation of the score, Postnikova on Erato label is far superior.Only the Sonata #3 is a motivation to own this cd in my opinion."
4,GREAT MUSIC,This a very good way to discover this underrated band. This is what progressive music is all about. Long and complex compositions that have enough emotion in it to keep it interesting. Not a bad song on this show. There is also some interesting visuals on the screen. A must for the prog fans. This DVD show's you how the 70's music is still enjoyable today.
3,They had to cut RTF??? Why? Why?,"Similar in sentiment to another reviewer, my criticism of this is not with the band but with the editing. This is a very good performance. But... Remember the Future was played in full at this show and they cut all of it out except for a 5 min excerpt (Let it Grow). why? Couldn't they have cut ""Nelly the Elephant"" or ""Fidgety Queen"" for example, if they really had to cut something?? Which I don't see why they would because the DVD doesn't last much more than an hour.And for those of you considering shelling out the exorbitant Amazon marketplace prices for this out-of-print item, don't![...]"
2,Bent easily,"This wasn't as strong as it looks, and bent easily under regular use within a matter of days. I was looking for something that was rigid and sturdy. This wasn't it. I threw it away; am posting this so others don't waste their money. I'm giving it 2 stars; 1 1/2 is more like it."
3,"Great series, bad DVD.","Lets get this one started now shall we. Let start off by saying this is one of my favorite anime. But the DVD is not so hot. It only contains 3 episodes per disk this one has 4-7, only 3 episodes and for the price.... The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because 1. It is a great series, 2. The picture is fair, and 3. the sound is fair. But the sound and picture look better on the DVD than they do on the show. So don't get this DVD and wait untill Viz releases the COMPLETE first season of Inuyasha."
1,yuperuny,OH MAN IT SUCKS DONT EVER BUY THEYRE FRICKEN BOOK/DVD's I HATED IT IT IS SO RETARTED AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
1,Not compatible with some CD players.,Those CDRs are not compatible with some CD players. Lexus CD player and Sony Boom box can't play them properly.
2,Pancake Flat,"I tested three different slanted cushions for use in playing my instrument. This cushion is nice looking, but it flattens out so much when I sit on it, that it might as well not be a wedge. I also purchased the Slant Seat Wedge, which is by far my favorite. The slightly firmer DreamFoamHD Orthopedic Coccyx Cushion, also flattened out way too much, especially under my rear, which made it less of a wedge that it was when it wasn't under my bum."
3,Jobri Visco Wedge,"The cushion materials are of good quality and very durable. It does help with elevating one's seated position, but it would be better if the cushion were firmer. It is a little too soft."
2,Inaccurate,"No mention of ME (CFS) an extremely debilitating and relatively common disease (though less in children than adults). Very brief and inaccurate mention of Fibromyalgia, which is just as disabling and four times as common as ME. Lists Fibro under noninflammatory (!) pain disorders."
5,SUPERIOR METHODOLOGY; VERY COMPREHENSIVE,"Designed by experts, and with care; ""Current Pediatric Diagnosis & Treatment"" is one book that both paediatricians and GPs know too well. It covered every aspect of child's health-care in a way that would arouse envy in other texts. Its superior methodology is one factor that has kept its name above others. The authors of this book deserve tons of commendations. They did a fantastic job. Every chapter of the book speaks for them!Its illustrations are utterly comprehensive; and the frequency with which its information is updated ensure that only the most current advances in paediatrics are included.Very welcomed! Books of this quality would ensure that doctors (and medics) will always live upto their respective billings."
4,Useful for Rotations,"I bought this as a used book for rotations. At this point (being 10 years old), it is getting a bit outdated. However, I still use this as a resource for certain things another one of my pediatric books does not cover in as much detail (such as the effects of smoking on children). Even though this is an older book, it can still be very useful on some key topics that may be left out of other sources."
4,Handy and Concise,Handy and concise book for the general pediatrician as well as the medical student with some interest in pediatrics. It deals with all the common conditions and a little bit more. I love the Lange series of medical books.
4,Very good resource,I love the Lange serires of medical texts. They work very well for me in my practice as a nurse practioner for quick look ups as well as for a more indepth study.
5,Best thing ever.,"Fantastic, amazing, excellent, mechanic's best friend! Cuts through grease like a hot knife through butter and won't destroy your skin or make you smell like orange peels from 50 feet away."
4,I will call this book Mentoring the Trainer,"Artistry in Training is good self help book for any Trainer. Stephanie has provided friendly guidance for being a confident Trainer. Her style of presenting facts, analysing them and offering of expert advise with empathy is the hallmark of this book.I find in this book a strong reasoning for every guidance offered.The book reflects great clarity and confidence in her field.Chapter 3 and chapter 7 is superb.I will call this book as Mentoring the Trainer.Thanks very much.."
5,You Gotta' Love Confucius,"I have always been interested in the sayings of Confucius and this book is a great resource for me. Wisdom never gets old or out of date, and this book proves it! I would never give it up, it's one of my ""GO-TO"" Books..."
2,What was he thinking?,"Presents the Analects ""in authentic I Ching order,"" an absurd decision which just means that any given passage is practically impossible to find. (In fact, a number of passages are left out, and at least one is included twice.) Contemporary language, occasionally clumsy and rarely lively. Pinyin romanization."
5,"Great product, easy to assemble","This product comes un-assembled. The instructions are very easy to follow and assembly was quick and easy. It would help if you had an extra set of hands to stretch the material and you attached the legs, but other than that, assembly is really a one-person job.We have two large basset hounds with very short legs. When I saw the assembled product, I thought there was no way they would be able to climb in and out of this bed. This product is so sturdy and well balanced, the dogs have no problems getting in and out using the sides (side rails?) for support.I would recommend this product and will buy it again when it is time to replace it."
3,Eric Owen Moss: Buildings and Projects 3,"In a brief introduction, Richard Meier contributes a keen appreciation of Moss, who represents the Dionysian spirit in architecture as expressively as the New York mandarin embodies the Apollonian. The roller coaster ride begins immediately after, racing through the latest installment of urban interventions in Culver City, and a flurry of unrealized projects from Ibiza to St Petersburg, nearly all sponsored or encouraged by the maverick developer Frederick Samitaur Smith. Much as one admires Smith's enlightened patronage, one wishes that other clients would also commission work from Moss, especially in LA, a place to which his work has a peculiar affinity."
2,Slightly larger than a shot glass,"I realize the picture/ description says 3 x 3 x 3, which is very small, but the size is inaccurate. Its more like a 2 x 2 x 2...its very small, literally slightly smaller than a shot glass. Unless you literally want just a splash of milk, there's hardly any room to froth in this. For someone like me who wanted a larger latte, this didn't work. I decided to go with the Krups 20 oz. one instead"
3,"Nice enough, but too expensive.","Don't get me wrong, I like it - but I really don't like how much I had to pay for it.It's made of real wood, the build quality is high, and it's attractive; but everything else about it is pretty much bare bones. Setting the timer is simple, but non-intuitive. It has precisely one function, and is otherwise featureless. It does the single job for which it's intended, but I just don't see why something the guts of an fancy egg timer had to cost me $80?"
3,So so,I thought this would be a work out video that I could do with my 9 month old based on the cover of the DVD case. Can't just a dvd by its cover :)
2,Not worth it,I bought three post natal videos and this one is by far the weakest. The workouts aren't very challenging and the pace is strange. I'd look elsewhere.
3,You get what you pay for,"This was a gift for my 1977 Olds 88-the cover is actually a bit on the bigger size-perhaps designed for the pre-1977 models? Once the wind gets underneath it, it's off. The grommets should help-I've got some plastic one-gallon water jugs saved up so that should help weigh it down. There are better covers out there, but then you're getting into hundreds of dollars. If you've got a paint job to be concerned over-go for the more expensive covers. Nothing will stop the ocean air though. Not even a garage!"
1,????????????????,"I would like to know what recordings by Maria Callas are on this CD before I purchase it. This is a major failing of so many of your CD offerings. There is no list of arias, let alone date and place of the recordings. Give me this information and I might purchase the CD. And then I will write a review."
1,Waldo is right,You guys need to get on the stick and put some descriptions on these albums. I won't buy if if don't get a description.
5,Another great Junior League cookbook,This a great cookbook. It has fabulous recipes together with a great history of the area. The cookbook is a product of the Junior League of Nashville. I have many other Junior League's cookbooks and I can always count on them being great cookbooks - this is true once again with Notably Nashville.
5,A Must Have,"A must have for anyone who collects cookbooks or loves fast, easy, and delicious recipes. Makes a great gift."
3,Slightly disappointed,Having followed EC for many years I was slightly disappointed. He seemed to be a little lethargic ... although everything was very well orchestrated...use this basisCompare EC's Sunshine of Your Smile with Jack Bruce and Peter Frampton's version on Ringo Starr's Allstars so far..and Jack Bruce and Peter Frampton are outstanding on both guitars and vocals.
4,"great show, worth buying","Video is excellent, not doing the constant jumping around like so many others do. Audio is also excellent, w/ great 5.1 DTS or Dolby. Also has subtitles in English available, which is REAL nice to see the words of the songs when you don't know them by heart. Only down side is I'd like to have heard more golden Eric oldies, but I know they don't always keep the same set. A definite buy!"
5,A DVD That will be watched over and over again!,"This DVD has great technical qualities for sound and picture. As far as the subject...c'mon it's Eric Clapton. There is no such thing as a ""bad"" Clapton performance. EC is one of the greatest musicians of our time and this DVD is a must have for the library archive of great musicians. I have been a Clapton fan since the 60's ""Cream"" era. I've seen him play in the early 80's at Yale Bowl in New Haven CT. He was great then and even better now! My favorite song on this DVD is Layla ... just the intro and the first few bars of this song is worth buying the DVD. His energy and talent prevails over the years. Billy Preston's song ""Will it go around in circles"" is another great tune. It's obvious that Billy is having fun playing this tune and the audience is digging it too! It's good to see that ""the 5th Beatle"" still rocks the house. Buy this DVD - you won't regret it!"
3,I'm Downgrading My Previous Review,"Let's save us both some time.Here's why you should buy this DVD: 1) You really dig Clapton's work and will support whatever he puts out. 2) You want a DVD that spans four genres of music. 3) You get a kick out of seeing the backup musicians looking like they're having the best jam session of their lives.Here's why you shouldn't buy this DVD: 1) Your really dig Clapton's work and expect him to deliver his best work when it's being recorded. This is not even close to being his best work. 2) You have heard about how passionate Clapton gets when he's feeling the blues and it pours out of him a la Stevie Ray Vaughan, Buddy Guy, or Little Milton. You'll be disappointed. His performance on this DVD, with the exception of ""River of Tears,"" is anemic.Would I spend the money for this DVD? Yes. Why? Three tracks are worth it. The rest is ""ehhhhhh.""Enjoy!"
5,Absolutely Fantastic!,This is hands down the best DVD that Eric Clapton has ever turned out. It begins great and never lets up to the end. The entire ensemble is terrific. 2 full hours that you cannot stop listening to.
5,"Same songs, but WOW what sounds and what a performance!","Looking at the playlist, it seems like another Clapton concert, essentially the same songs as ""Unplugged"",""24 Nights"", ""Chronicles"" and ""Friends in Hyde Park"". These are all wonderful performances captured on DVD, but this concert has an extra dynamic quality to it. You find yourself drawn into this 2001 concert, you are enjoying the music and experience as much as the musicians. It could be the wonderful long solos by Clapton, the energy that Billy Preston adds by punctuating the songs with his organ, Nathan East's bass or the organ and electronic wind playing of David Sancious and Greg Phillinganes. The songs cover Eric's career from Derek and the Domino's through Reptile - acoustic and electric (with an unusual lack of guitar changes).You will enjoy this concert over and over! Save yourself some money and get the combo DVD/CD package - you will want to listen at home on your theater system and while traveling."
5,Pure Eric,This concert DVD is fantastic. Eric is superb. He is the best guitarist for many years. Can't wait to see him live in concert again. Hope he tours to So. Florida soon.
5,This is a great dvd!,"""River of Tears"" alone is worth the price of this dvd. I saw the concert back in the late 90's and can attest to the fact that this is Clapton at his finest. Definitely in my top ten dvd's of all time."
5,Best Concert DVD I've EVER seen!,"I have always idolized Eric Clapton for his guitar skills but I'd only really known a few of his hits. Recently, I have really delved into his music. My third purchase was the ""One More Car, One More Rider"" 2CD/DVD set.Let me just say I was, and still am, amazed! His solos and just general guitar playing are, as usual, OUT of this WORLD! I just sit there and stare with my mouth hanging open, savoring every moment.His vocals are 100% perfect! I can't remember a single time on this DVD that I thought to myself ""ooh, he hit a bad note."" Searing vocals and even hotter guitar solos!And he's also backed by his AMAZING band including Billy Preston and Andy Fairweather-Low!Best concert DVD I have EVER seen and probably the best one I will see for a LOOONG time.Now I just wish I could actually see Clapton live. It would be a dream come true!If you are considering buying a Clapton DVD and you can't decide: BUY THIS ONE! You will NOT regret it!"
2,BUYER BEWARE,"Buyer Beware! Beautiful sound capability, but the 3-CD drawer or tray broke after 24 calendar hours of use! The very fancy mechanism that pulls CD's in and out broke, and ate my CD! THERE IS NO TECH SUPPORT FROM PIONEER! You may be better off with a less fancy, single tray unit. From the other reviews, this is obviously a problem with the product line, not just a single lemon. PROCEED WITH CAUTION!"
3,"good, but not great","I have had this for about one year, and it has only one mechanical flaw - an occasional failure to shut down after finalizing (I just turn off the unit for a second - then it's ok). GOOD POINTS: the skip ID is invaluable for getting rid of mistakes recorded on CD-Rs; the volume control has a wide range and a knob (far superior to the Phillips model it replaced); the program mode is moderately easy to use and greatly speeds up making mix CDs; excellent data readouts. BAD POINTS: disc changers are clunky and the unit is constantly trying to read the discs when you're doing something else (if you buy it, you'll know what I mean); the button labels on the front panel are microprinted in red (I had to put my own labels on them); the remote is tiny and packed with controls for putting labels on the CD-Rs, so it's not easy to use (and vertically symmetrical so you can't use it in low illumination, or else); max recording speed is 2x."
1,Don't bother with this one !!!!!,"I have had the same problem with this unit. Loading mechanism malfunctions. Pioneer was no help. That's why they are slipping. They used to make great, reliable stereo equipment. Not anymore! Their customer service dept. stinks! This unit is noisy, records poorly and is not worth the money. STAY AWAY TILL PIONEER WAKES UP!"
4,PD-RW739 PIONEER RECORDER,I have had this recorder for several months now. I have not had a problem. Recording CD's and the disc drawers work great.I bought it on-line it was shipped from 6 states away by USPS.I am very happy with it's performance.
3,PIONEER PD-RW739 Compact Disc Recorder With 3-Disc CD Change,"There Are At Least 2 Sides To Everything - Hot And Cold, Yin And Yang, Heads And Tails, Record And Play...Here's A CD Recorder And ReWriter For Your Home Component Stereo System That's Designed For Versatility And Ease So You Can Create Exceptional Digital Recordings For Continued Playback Enjoyment ...On One Side Is A 3 Disc CD Player And Changer And On The Other Side Is A Single CDRW Recorder...CD-R And CD-RW Recording With CD, CD-R, CD-RW Playback...2x Recording (Up To 300,000 Bits Of Information Per Second) Allow Fast Recording ...Digital Record Volume...Digital Synchro Recording...Optical And Coaxial Digital Inputs ...Digital Output...Multifunction FL Display...Jack For Connecting Optional Stereo Headphones (Headphone Volume Control)...Remote Control ...Experience The Versatility Of Having Both Sides Available, As You Need Them A Versatile Component For Your Home Audio System / 3 CD Player And 1 CDRW Recorder Deck..."
1,This Movie seriously is in need of one,"This movie was terrible. This movie is the one that needs a ""divine intervention"" Spare me pls! I watched for as long as I could stand it and then I simply had to stop! I wish I could get a divine intervention and get my $2.99 back.I do not recommend this movie to anyone, and for the record, I am NOT into blockbusters, but seriously, this was the worst movie I have ever seen."
3,Audio and Video Lacking,"As a longtime fan of Queen, since their first release, ""Keep Yourself Alive"", this disc lacks in audio and video quality. The band performs their usual bang up performance, and the set list is consistent with their later shows, but camera angles are bad, video and audio production quality are lacking as well. Again, I do enjoy this because I am a Queen fanatic, but there are other live concerts to own before making this live purchase. Of course, the obvious first is Live Aid, which captures their entire Earthshaking performance."
4,A Spiffy Little Toy!!!!,"The Nomad II is a great mid-level MP3 player. Very good sound control over a wide range of music styles. Loud enough to get your attention when AC/DC is loaded up for a serious gym workout - it seems to be skip-proof, doesn't rattle around a lot when you are biking or running. I swapped out the headset for a pair of the sony flexibles as the shape of the original was a bit bothersome when riding - a minor inconvenience rather than a show stopper.The down side is this is a razor-razor blade situation - and at $80 for an extra blade, it can get pricy if you need to have 3 or 4 extra memory cards. Or plan on swapping songs off the card frequently. The software is a no brainer - I'm on widnows 98 on one system and 2000 on another with zero problems.I do wish that it had an expandable memory option - at 64meg, it's just a bit thin and no options to upgrade to 128 or above. If that were addressed, this gizmo would be a world beater."
3,CD's- good,"mp3 players are nifty little gadgets, but they still have a little ways to go. i was excited before my screen froze and the battery cover got stuck. it had easy to understand icons and i didn't even need the directions to learn how to use most of the basic operations. but i tried to copy a cd, and to get a decent amount of music on it you degrade the sound quality and it ""skips"", so to speak, which is quite annoying if you're a big music fan. you also have to have access to a computer whenever you want to put new music on it, which you'll have to do often if you listen to enough music in the course of a day. so, i suggest sticking to cd's till they are bigger memory options available. cd's aren't always the best, but they're about the most convenient right now."
4,"Except for a few glitches, this is a great product","The quality of sound and thoughtfulness in making this product is remarkable. It has a lot of features, including lock feature, remote control, voice recording, fm radio, and a usb cable. There however a few glitches, which in my opinion makes the Nomad less than perfect and not quite as close to the level of a Sony product. First, the headphones are not too comfortable. The band tends to hit your ears. Second, taking out the battery cover requires a lot of effort which, up to this point, I have not figured yet a reliable way of doing it. And there is no ac battery output unless you get a docking station. Thus, except for those few noticeable glitches this is a great product"
1,Watch Out for Creative Labs Warranty,The warranty period for the Nomad II is only 90 days. Mine went out after about 95 days and I was told I had to cough up another $77.00 to replace the bare unit. Creative Labs' quality is about the worst I have ever come across. Stay away from their products if you don't want to get ripped off
2,better buy mg,"I recently got both versions of this device. After using them for 2 months or so I think it's time to tell about my experiences. First you should know, that the MG version sounds much better and also seems to have a much better radio tuner, which is suitable for mobile use. The ordinary Nomad 2 has a more useful display, but the sound really sucks. Overtuning and cracks during radio playback are a steady companion. On contrary the MG Nomad 2 sounds remarkably better (actually as good as it looks) and the finish of the hardware is top quality comparable with SONY standarts on mobile devices. But beware: Handling is a real mess. It will make you crazy accidentially pressing various buttoms on the mg. If you are about to choose, take the much more expensive Nomad 2 MG. At least it sounds good and is the best visual design availlable on the market. The ordinary Nomad 2 is a 100% disappointment and a shame for Creative's hardware line up"
1,keeps breaking!,"I own a Nomad II 64 MP3 player and it has broken for a second time - the warranty was only 60 days, and shortly thereafter, it stopped working, so I had to send it back and have it repaired for [$$$] (on the phone you can only talk to customer service reps, not technicians, and none of them could ever tell me what happend or how to prevent it from happening again in the future). The repair came with another generous 60 day warranty. The repair lasted about a year, and now it is broken again (in a similar but different way) - and I have always been very careful with it and it has never been physically harmed. Now that it is broken a second time I don't see the need to put more money into it, only to have it break again."
2,Does not work right,the player worked right for like 2 or 3 days then started to turn on and off by itself also would not turn on correctly.
1,Nomad II - ho-hum,Creative Nomad II plays CD quality mpeg files OK but it seriously lacks in performance and especially ergonomics. 1.)FM tuner sensitivity is poor (no DX). 2.)Low volume output (it's not the earphones). 3.)Creative Software (upgraded) locks W2000 computer. 4.)Navigating menus with tiny joystick button is cumbersome. 5.)LCD menus navigation is non-intuitive and inconsistent. 6.)Earphones are uncomfortable and interfere with glasses. Why'd I keep it? cause it was a gift.
4,I'm Happy With It,"Although some things with this player are kind of confusing, like how you have to set the radio presets through the software, it's pretty quick and easy when downloading and erasing MP3s. I can't compare this player to any others, however I'm satisfied with the product."
3,Some sloppy engineering,"Great set of features. I really wanted the radio stations and recorder. But I found the reception for the radio to be poor, and I live in a major city. I also found the design of the battery holder and cap to be a royal pain. I have to fight to get it open, and the battery and memory insert very poorly designed. You need to remove the memory to remove the battery.I love the wireless control.Overall, enormous advancement from the MP3 players of a year ago, but engineering-wise, they needed to spend a little more time in beta testing."
3,This Player has Some Faults,"I bought this player to use at the gym. I think overall the ease of use and the sound quality are very good. However, the sturdiness of the equipment is questionable. This player comes with a remote control off the headphone wire that after 4 months no longer works and the clip on the remote has broken off. I called Creative, only to be told that I have to order a new one because the 3 month warranty has run out. I am not very hard on this player but even so, something like this that is portable should be able to with-stand a gym environment. So, if you are in the market for something to take to the gym, this player may not be the best choice."
2,"If this was your firts choice, go with your second","As far as hardware goes, it's a great player - that's why I gave it two stars. Unfortunately hardware requires software, and in this case, Creative's software support is terrible.The software that ships requires and update - over 3.7 MG download. And if you rebuild your machine, you need to reintsall all the old software, then install the updates on top.If you buy this player, plan on spending a lot of time messing with the software. Oh, and by the way, it crashes my computer. Maybe it will work better on your's once you get it installed, download the updates, and install those too.I wish I'd bought something else."
1,More bad than good,"Good News: compact, light weight, good sound qualityBad News: Quirky operation, especially the ""on-off"" function. Headphones shorted out within six months (warranty is only for one month). Limted volume. Creative Labs offers really awful support--it appears they would rather not be bothered with customer issues. I'm looking to other manufacturers as I get ready to make purchases for my family."
4,O So Sweet,"The Nomad 2 from Creative is a huge success in the music industry. An excellent buy for a consumer who wants both good quality and storage space. The Nomad 2 is special because it is one of the first Mp3 Players to have a radio along with it. The radio is accompanied by stoargae for roughly 15 songs with about 4 minutes per song. Along with the radio and the Mp3's there is a clock and date, personal setting, and a fast hookup with a computer. The Nomad 2 is an excellent buy suggested for anyone looking for a fair priced Mp3 Player."
3,Defective Player despite great features,"The Creative Lab's Nomad II has the best features available for an mp3 player of its size. The LCD player, despite current reviews, is only unwieldy if you have impaired motor skills. For the rest of the ""normal"" world, its no problem. The voice recording is great for students and the FM radio, as well as its small size and remote control feature is great for joggers.Despite all of these great features, the Nomad II player that I got for Christmas was broken the day that I opened it. The screen freezes up every single time that I use it- usually within the first few minutes of play, and then there is no sound. I have to remove the batteries, then plug them back in and restart the whole thing before it begins to work again.Although a great deal of ""creative"" thought went into this player, Creative Labs obviously skimped on the quality control. Should have bought a Sony."
2,I've had this for a couple of months & it's not great,"The electronics on this are OK. The user interface, to put it mildly, stinks. The software that comes bundled with it is buggy and will sabotage any and all other audio programs on your computer; these problems are difficult to get rid of. Other players will upload files to your computer; this one won't, which I didn't know when I bought it. Though the appeal is that it's shockresistant, the beltclip that comes with it is short and slick, so that if you try to run with it, it will fall off every time. The buttons are small, and finicky -- you WILL enter the wrong thing about every third time.The sound is great, but it's not worth the hassle. I find myself going back to my ... Phillips CD player more and more often. I can't recommend this product, as I feel gypped."
5,Very surprised...,"I was very surprised when I heard the soundqualityof this product, it is really amazing !Everything works fine ! Haven't had any problems yet !Especially normal batteries stay good for about 8 hrs,which I think is very important, I have had a differentMP3 Player before which didn't last very long with normal batteries ! All together I am very happy that I purchasedthis item !So long....."
3,Customer Service,"Good product - Bad service: The headphones the Nomad II comes with are actually two pieces, one being a headphone unit and one being a remote-type unit that attaches directly to the player. The headphones by themselves are not long enough to be usable without the remote unit. After 95 days (not kidding) the remote unit broke and Creative Labs refused to exchange my broken unit for a new one because they only offer a 90-day warranty. They have a good product at a good price and could have had a lifelong customer. Now, I would never buy from Creative again and would suggest taking your business elsewhere if customer service is something you consider important."
1,Only 64 megs?!?,"I tell you, with the coming out of products like the Creative Nomad Jukebox (with 6 GB of storage space for mp3), I can't see what good these little things are. This sells for [price], the Nomad Jukebox sells for maybe twice that. Considering the amount of storage you're getting, it's a great deal. Just not for these little puny 64 meg devices."
1,WARNING,"This Product Stinks, When I got my Nomad 2 the USB connector was broken, When I called the customer support, they refused to send me a new one and instead told me to go to my local Dealer and buy one, So I had to search around my City looking for a dealer that would be willing to give me a new USB cable in exchange for the broken one I was sent with my product. When ifinally found a dealer that had the cable, which was 10 miles from my home, they refused to exchange one for me, and told me that i would have to buy a new one. In the end I ended up paying 10 dollars for an extra cable. Of course I was quite annoyed that a company would do this, I opted to sell my Nomad 2 on ebay, and with the money I get, buy a Rio 500, I heard it was alot ""user friendly"". And AMazon has the lowest price for the RIO 500, So do yourself a favor, and not buy the Nomad 2, but instead go for the Rio 500. End."
3,A Question For Reviewers,"I currently own a Diamond Rio PMP-300 that I won at a trade show. It is a first generation player, and it shows. Badly placed controls are the second-worst thing.I'm curious if anyone can answer the following question. Does the Nomad II fix my biggest peeve with the Rio, namely: if I stop the Rio in the middle of a song, when I start it again, it goes back to the beginning of the track rather than starting off where I stopped (like my portable CD players would). Pause would work, but it turns itself off in about a minute anyway, losing my place as above. Not a big deal on 3-minute hits, but a PITA for symphonies and progressive rock, with tracks as lon as 30 minutes.Anyway, if anyone is willing to try this in their nomad II, I'd really like an answer.-ben-"
1,Stupid People,I don't understand you people. Why would you buy a product like the nomad II when products like the Rio 500 and 600 are out in the market?!?!?! Don't waste your money in this product!
1,Please don't buy this defective wonder,"I got my Nomad II today and immediately downloaded some favorite MP3s, as well as 'samples' included in the box. ALL files were sampled at 128kps/44.1 KhZ. ALL files also play back with compression artifacts (flanging): pops, whistles, cracks, and 'skips'. The firmware CODEC is defective, as these files play fine on my PC with software CODECs. I tried upgrading the firmware to the latest version, but keep getting an error. The only way to get tech support from Creative is to call a toll number.Products should work 'out of the box' without user intervention. This one doesn't. I plan on returning it tomorrow. I read another review that recommended buying a minidisc player for about $100 USD less. Sounds like a great idea."
5,Great product overall,"Love it but with two caveats: 1. The cord on the headphones is too short. 2. It would be nice if the volume could go higher.I bought new headphones which solved the first problem and find that most songs can be made loud enough, so the second problemisn't an issue most of the time."
4,"totally awesome,you guys!!",rockin cool stuff..a few different folks croonin' and some fine instrumentals..pick this up if you dig swingabilly..i do and i did and i'm glad!!
3,A good book for American history,"The Way We Lived is a good book for anyone who is interested in American History. I have read serveral chapters of it and I feel that it's a level of understanding for everyone. If you're looking for background information, this book is great. Also, this is a good book for students who are interested in learning the background situations that have occurred in our history."
2,"All Bombast, No Depth","I have always been a fan of more rousing pieces of classical music, so was looking forward to this CD, and while it certainly is loud and rousing, it lacks any subtlety or nuance, any true dynamism. It seems to favour speed and bravado over any real feeling. The few quiet moments lack any real emotion or depth, as well. I listen to this type of music to energize me, to exorcise demons. This album merely fatigued me."
2,mine broke within a week,"It's an attractive design, but may suffer from poor gluing of the thermometer bulb/glass to the temperature insert card. I returned it for a refund and am continuing the search for an attractive and durable zipper pull thermometer."
1,Incorrect Readings,The thermometer is at least 4-5 degrees off and gets less accurate the colder it is outside. It is useless for its purpose.
1,NEVER RECEIVED,"These items were supposed shipped with a rain gauge - got the rain gauge NOT the thermometers, but was charged for them! The rain gauge is a superior product, would have liked to have seen the thermometers, they probably would have be a superior quality also."
5,Intriguing Character Development...,"More of the same, but on a greater scale. After a fun filler episode where Utena and Anthy switch bodies, we're introduced to some downright weird but ultimately mystifying episodes tying together the pasts of Saionji, Touga and Utena. Nanami's insane personality takes a bit more sinister turn, and Touga, after possibly proving himself to be a ""prince,"" turns into a master planner. After Utena falls for his trap, she is forced to re-examine her life.Not only does Rose Collection 2 keep you glued to your seat (I watched the whole DVD in a day wheras I spread out the first one), but it also works as a great set-up for the second season. I haven't seen it and don't know what will happen, but after seeing that black rose seal, I can't wait to find out."
2,CAUTION: May not work on your DVD player!,"I don't know if anyone else has encountered this, but this DVD will not play on my JVC 501BK DVD player. The player's a region 1 player, but the DVD is labelled ""ALL"". It *should* play okay...but won't play at all. Utena Volume 1 (and dozens of other DVDs) work just fine. I know the DVD can't be entirely busted because it DOES play on my Apple PowerBook.As you might expect, I'm not too thrilled about this. However, as usual actual the Utena story is wonderful...I just wish I could watch it on my TV! I just wanted to mention this in case anyone else had this DVD player...or a similar JVC model."
5,Surprisingly Funny and Surprisingly Intense,"Having only heard of Utena, I decided to check it out. The first dvd (rose collection 1) got me hooked. And this dvd is even better. It's a rather complex plot and very interesting character development throughout the episodes. One episode you see a silly Nanami character and a few episodes later you get insight into her psyche that would make any sane person steer clear of this disturbed girl.One minute you're laughing the next you're rather sad and sympathetic to all the characters including Utena Tenjou herself. Get all the dvds to this one. It's worth the money.I can't wait until the rest of them come out because dangit I wank to know what happens next!"
5,1 MPG improvement,"I recommend this product, but only experienced 1mpg improvement in city driving, not sure if it made any difference on highway driving. Fit was perfect and I like the idea that I can wash the filter and not worry about buying a new one. My car is a Subaru Impreza 2.5i 2008"
1,Doesn't fit the 2011 Subaru Outback,I just tried to install this filter in the 2011 Subaru Outback Limited PZEV and it does not fit. It is a hair to big and the clips will not close if you put this filter in.
4,Tough to install,"Great air filter, but it took me a while to install it in my STi. I imagine it would be easy for those who work on cars regularly."
4,true to its name and rep,"bought this for my 09 Subaru Impreza and I have had it in for about a week,I have noticed a slight increase in power and acceleration but havent really noticed any gas mileage improvement in city driving but noticed a slight improvement in gas mileage on highway driving.ive used K&N in V-8 cars ive owned and noticed the power difference so I would recommend this to anyone who wants a little more power and wants too keep there car basically stock and not install a cold air intake type system and possibly void warranty.the filter fit perfectly and was very easy to install with just a screwdriver"
1,Does not fit 2010 Forester as advertised,"I spent a good five minutes trying to squeeze this thing into place before I gave up, cursing, and compared its dimensions to the old paper filter I was replacing. It is visibly wider by a good 1/8 inch and simply won't fit into the housing. I went to AutoZone to see if their computer also recommends this model for the 2010 Forester and it does, so if anyone out there has advice for me on a filter model that actually does fit, please share!"
2,K&N Filter,"I ordered this K&N filter for my 2008 Subaru WRX. After about one hour of trying to get this product in my Subaru WRX, it would not fit properly! Other Subaru 2008 WRX owners have this same complant! I wrote a e-mail to K&N about the fit issue, they did not responed! Do not buy a K&N filter for a Subaru 2008 WRX, It will not fit! I have purchase K&N filters before with no issue."
3,Does not fit 2010 Forester,"I've been a fan of K&N; filters for awhile and have them in other vehicles. However, for my 2010 Subaru Forester, it simply does not fit. The inner gasket is too wide and does not seat correctly.I looked up on the K&N; web site to confirm the part number, and sure enough they have the same part #. So... K&N; is wrong as well.Looking at other reviews of this filter on Amazon, K&N; doesn't seem to fit Foresters. Buyer beware.3 stars because I like the product."
3,This didn't improve performance for me,"I couldn't detect any improvement in performance, with a 2006 Subaru Tribeca. In fact, I ended up replacing it with a new OEM filter, because I've heard K&N filters don't filter quite as well."
2,It doesn't Fit! Waste of Money,"I was really excited about getting this filter and unfortunately trusted that sinceI told the vendor what kind of car it was for, that we would merely have to install it. The oil change wasn't due for a month but I didn't worry, stupidly trusting that we had a super duper air filter. Well, it doesn't fit. Its too big. I dont' really know what to do next since they knew what car it was for so maybe they simply don't have a filter for the 2004 Prius.K&N; 33-2304 Replacement Air Filter"
1,Does not fit 1998 Subaru Forester 2.5,I received the product and tried to install in my air filter housing. The rubber band around the air filter is too wide and sits up too high. I can not engage the tabs at the bottom of the filter housing. I have used the products on all my other vehicles with out any problems but this is too big. I will rma the product back to Amazon and buy a stock filter from my slug local parts store branch. Good thing I checked out the air filter it was all dirty and clogged so I should see some improvement with a new filter. [...]
1,HORRIBLE! MPG DROPPED DRAMATICALLY!!! THIS FILTER SUCKS!!!,"If I could I would rate this filter 0 out of 5 stars. I bought it for my 2010 SUBARU WRX and felt no improvement at all...the only thing I felt was my bank account shrinking due to the bad MPG this filter gave me. For all of us WRX drivers, premium gas prices are getting to high! I would usually get 20-24mpg on streets & 25-28mpg hwy (w/stock air filter) ...this crap (k&n) filter killed my gas to 16-19mpg on streets & could barely get to 20-21mpg hwy!!! RIDICULOUS!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND STAY WITH THE STANDARD OEM AIR FILTER. I popped in a new OEM air filter today, filled up and drove home on the streets and got 24.6MPG BIG DIFFERENCE!!! Another thing I noticed is that this filter doesn't fit as tight as the original. Either way, this was junk!!!"
3,"Cute, but pieces fall off easily","Our 3-month old twins wore these for Halloween. So cute! Sadly, there is no way to get the hands and feet to tighten and we spent the whole night chasing down lost paws. On the plus side, the cloak is quite warm and we really didn't need more on them other than a long-sleeved onesie and a set of leg warmers."
1,A Pedant's View of China,It's quite obvious that Professor Fewsmith never left the clostered chambers of Boston University. His sources are chiefly those of speeches and reports of China's dictatorial rulers.If he had visted Beijing's universities and spoken with the students and instructors he'd have gotten a much different impression. For example he was of the eroneous opinion that the protest of the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade was a spontanious outpour of national sentiment. If he'd been at Beijing University he could have seen how government agents paid students to participate in a government orchestated demonstration at the U.S. Embassy.The Taiwan issue is another of his numerous misinterpretations.Thousands of wealthy Taiwan merchants and corporate magnets are investing millions of dollars into the Chinese economy. Their bribery has essentially gained control of the Chinese leaders. It is Taiwan who is conquoring China.
4,error correction,The image shown here is WRONG for this edition of the book. The image must be from a later edition.
1,Great Strings but Sam Ash sent damaged boxes,"The one star rating regards the company that shipped the strings, and NOT the strings themselves (which I would rate 4 stars). I really like the strings - they sound good and last a decent amount of time. Sam Ash was the Amazon seller. The strings arrived pretty quick but Sam Ash did a lame job of packing - all the individual boxes were totally smashed. The strings weren't damaged as far as I can tell, but I didn't appreciate Sam Ash's carelessness. I'll just avoid Sam Ash for any and all mail-order purchases in the future."
4,Transforming,"This book is written with the newbie in mind, yet it is chocked full of informative topics that should enlighten even the intermediate and advanced student. Successfully covers astrological topics that most beginning books don't or won't attempt. An instructive and unassuming guide for all levels."
2,Made in China,"I ordered this for my 1995 Z28 because it looked like a good price and said it would fit. It did not fit - not even close. I was further disappointed that it was made in China. I learned that my Z28 demands quality parts, to exact specifications, or they just don't work right."
4,Where Are The Rest Of The Episodes?,"Let's see....114 episodes produced between 1958 and 1961, and only 32 episodes total released from the first season on the first two sets. Where are the rest?"
4,Good entertainment,"These 30 minute episodes are very interesting. I love the character Peter Gunn as he handles himself with a great amount of coolness and effectiveness. The plots are a little simple by todays standards but that may be due to the episodes being only 30 minutes as opposed to the 60 minute ones that most have today. Still, I would recommend this series to all murder mystery fans out there and who also are somewhat driven by nostalgia for this time period."
5,MY FAVORITE TV DETECTIVE,"I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST ""DISCOVERED"" ""PETER GUNN"". I WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN THEN. AT THAT TIME I WAS TUNING IN EVERY WEEK TO WATCH RERUNS OF ""PETER GUNN"". I WAS VERY EXCITED WHEN I LEARNED IT WAS AVAILABLE TO OWN ON ""DVD"". WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW NOW IS WILL THE REMAINING EPISODES EVER BECOME AVAILABLE? MY THING ABOUT SOME OF THESE ""OLD TELEVISION SHOWS"" IS ONLY SOME OF THE EPISODES ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE, LEAVING US FANS DANGLING AND HOPING FOR THE REST. I PURCHASED BOTH OF THE ""PETER GUNN"" SETS IN 2005. AND I'M STILL WAITING TO SEE WILL THERE BE A VOLUME 3 AND OR 4. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW MANY EPISODES THERE WERE? ""PETER GUNN"" IS SO COOL. ITS STILL THE BEST DETECTIVE SHOW EVER."
1,dangerous prodcut get a graco,"i made certain all sides were locked prior to placing my 14 month old daugher in this playyard. within five minutes the lock broke and the side collapsed on my daughter. thankfully she was unharmed. i called the company and was given a very hard time and was told i would have to send the item back to them to be repaired. i did NOT want to ever place my child back in this play yard as the directions specifically state if the sides collapse it can cause injury and DEATH. anne and connie at baby trend were very rude and unhelpful and insisted i send it back for repair. fortunately i was able to return it to the store, and after a discussion with the manager who saw my play yard was in perfect condition gave me a refund and i PROMPTLY WENT AND BOUGHT A GRACO. do not buy this product or your child could be seriously injured."
5,This is Great!,"I was somewhat leary as I registered for this item considering all the negative reviews, however, since I was in love with the other pieces in the set I decided to just go for it. I am glad I did. As a first time mom there is no one more ""baby gear challenged"" then myself and I had this puppy up and running in under twenty minutes. It is sturdy, the directions are clear and I am confident that it is safe. Of course, for those who do not read directions I can sympathize with their issues as all playards have built in safety features such as make sure the top rails are locked before the bottom will go down. Sometimes it helps to know these things in advance (read the directions). I am just grateful that I ignored the reviews and went with my ""motherly instinct"". Turns out I was right :-)"
1,dangerous product,"The plastic center lock, which keeps the whole playard from collapsing, broke after I used this item for less than two months. My baby daughter now weighs just 12 pounds - thankfully she wasn't in it when I noticed the legs didn't look quite straight this morning. Then, we discovered the broken part. Other reviewers at this site mention the exact same problem! Beware! This playard was not subject to any abuse or repeated packing -- it has been set up in the same location all along."
1,Not a very good playard,"I haven't even had my baby yet and I decided to take out the playard to see how it went together. It was hard to get the sides to stay up. The buttons are inside the material which makes it difficult for the sides to stay up. The middle of the playard where you are supposed to lock it is plastic and it looked like it was about to break the first time I tried to put it together. Then I was going to take it back to the store to exchange it and I had my sister load it up for me and the handle broke. I feel like this playard is a piece of junk. I wouldn't buy it. It is hard to put together and take apart. Also, where you connect the changing table to the playard is plastic and doesn't look like it will last."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"Ok if they made a ""zero star"" i'd be using it. while we were at babies r us we randomly picked out this playpen because it was ""cute"" and had ""nice addionally accessories""... but after getting it home and it taking an hour and a half to put together.. we were starting to wonder if it was worth it.. it didn't seem to ""feel right"" but i know we followed the instructions word for word. we too noticed the bottom was popping up.. didn't think MUCH of it.. AND THEN we came online and saw the reviews (should have looked at them first) and saw how horrible everyone thought it was!! so i knew we wern't alone.. one review even explains how it collapsed on someones daughter.. IM NOT CHANCING IT!! thank god i got this and set it up BEFORE my daughter was here!!! DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,Don't risk putting your baby in danger,"I purchased this playard for my newborn. I liked the bassinet feature and also the changing table. I used it only a couple of times then decided it was a SAFETY HAZARD. The bottom kept popping up making it possible for it to collapse, the canopy wouldn't stay up and to top it off the bassinet was tilted causing the baby to roll to the other side. I tried everything to fix this thing, finally i just decided to return it to toysrus. I bought a graco and haven't had any problems with it, and the setup time was 15 minutes (I should've bought a graco to begin with)"
2,Boring,"So far I have not liked a single X-Files novel. They tend to be boring, slow, and missing the Mulder/Scully banter. Whirlwind is no exception. Although it is set in New Mexico, it definitely did not have a southwestern flavor."
2,WEAK PLOT AND POOR PACE MAKE THIS SOMETHING TO SKIP,"I like Grant's writing style and thought that he did a great job with Goblins. While the book has some similar style to Goblins, it falls way short and I was left with an unsatisfied feeling after finishing the book. Terrific idea, great setting (Southwest USA) but this comes across like a Hillerman wannabe...the ending was very poor and not enough development to the characters left a confusing and unsettling conclusion."
4,Creepy...,"I don't usually like spin-off books but I picked this up at an airport before a long flight and I was surprised because it was actually a pretty good book...you probably wouldn't enjoy it if you don't follow the show, but if you do, it captures the real atmosphere of the TV series. Despite a bit of a slow start, haunting...and after having caved and read two of the other Kevin Anderson/Charles Grant books I'd definitely say this one was the best."
4,"A little weak, but good overall","This was a pretty good read. The plot was a little weak, but it was good overall. I still wish there would be a book with more 'shippiness though. Anywho, this book did really well in my eyes."
3,Ho-hum,"Hey, if you remember the episode where the prisoner is caught in a tornado and then is able to wreck revenge on those he felt wronged him by scouring their bodies with the tornado, you probably don't need to read the book. There are too many similarities in plot to ignore. To be fair, Grant wrote the book long before the episode aired but the X-file clearly overlaps. There are a couple of very good Mulder and Scully descriptions that are right on target though. However in the end, the ""monster"" in this book is a bit too similar to the one seen on the show."
4,Good afternoon read,"I read this book in just a couple of hours one eveeything. It's not a challenging read. It is also a series tie-in. That being said, don't expect great things from it. It's a book written as an episode. The characters are the characters you've grown to love. There's no deep mystery or non expectation of weirdness here. If you're looking for exceptiinal writing, well thought out plots that keep you up at night wondering if it's possible....forget it. This is XFiles. Just go into it as a nice way to pass a few hours with some people you enjoy."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Second of the same.The next X-Files tie-in is basically the same as the first, in terms of quality, that is, not very good.Also another strange series of killing to investigate for the FBI duo, only with some boring even for Mulder odd occurrences along the way. These were definitely disappointing.2.5 out of 5"
4,EXCELLENT RICE COOKER LIKE ZOJIRUSHI WITH LESS FEATURES!!!,HI!I have zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy 10 cup and has many cook settings compared with this elite fuzzy logic.But i bought this Elite with only 5 cook settings....but the inner pot is nonstick and everything inside like zojirushi and the quality is excellent....my friend make mixed rice using the cook setting; RICE and get perfect mixed rice!!! i tested mixed rice from this rice cooker and is the same with my mixed Rice using my Zojirushi cook setting; mixed & the design is nice with timer.for this price is good buy
4,Its good for its price,It isn't that 'catchy' but fulfills the purpose.I like the extra pocket to carry SD card/battery
4,The Perfect Size,"I bought this case to go with my Sony Cyber-Shot DSC90. My camera fits in it perfectly! There is even a little front slot that would hold an extra battery or memory card (although it would be snug). This is a good case for traveling with your camera. The only thing I would change is I would make the case a bit less bulky. It makes my camera go from less than 1 inch thick to almost 2 inches thick, which is not so good for carrying in my little purses. but besides that its great. when i need to put it in a smaller purse I just use my iPod sock, which fits it perfectly with no added width!"
5,You feel secure with this case,"This is not a slim case, but it isn't huge.I love how plush it is inside.With such a large display on my T-100, I was worried about scratches.Not an issue with this case.This case works perfect.Just understand, it doesn't fit inside a pocket, hence the velcro belt loop.Great case, would highly recommend."
3,Sony LCS-CST Soft Cyber-shot Carrying Case,"For my tastes, it's a little too snug and scratchy in character. I do not detect scratch damage on the camera, but don't enjoy forcing it in. I also would have preferred a strap to go around my neck, rather than a loop to snap it to a belt. It works."
2,Sony LCS-CST soft carrying case for cybershot camera,Case is made well but the pocket for your extra battery is so tight you can hardly get it out. Would not recommend unless you use it for camera ONLY.Also there is no strap for carrying it.
4,A case that works well,A nice case for most compact cameras. A no-no for mega zoom digital camera.Small addition pocket for sd card or spare battery under the velcro works great.Belt loop is functionally placed.Overall quality is good.
5,Great Case,"I bought several (3) of these cases for the cameras I bought my children for Christmas. For the money, you can not beat them. Very well made, will last a lot longer than the cameras will, and they take care of their cameras."
3,Just as it pictured,"I ordered this to go along with the Sony digital camera, purchased on Amazon as well. This is good quality and delivery was on time."
3,Mixed feelings...,"A couple of years ago I bought this case and it has been great. So this time, when we purchased a similar camera, I bought another one. The new case has a little problem: the button that attaches a strap on the back (the one that wraps the case to your belt) is loose and it opens easily. The first case I bought had a very sturdy button that works great, but this one dosen't have the same quality..."
4,Good for the money,"My DSC W80 fits nice and snug in this case. It does have limited to no storage. The front pocket, which is the only one, fits a spare battery OR a spare memory stick, not both. I use it to store a spare battery cause I use a 8GB memory stick which is obviouysly in the camera and need no more memory than that. I like it."
3,A little small,This camera case can just barely hold my compact camera... making the small zipper pouch on the front useless. Cannot fit my backup battery or backup media chip in the case.
4,"Good protection for your camera, but little space for anything else","A good case, soft on the inside providing enough protection for the camera, while hard on the outside to protect it from external damage. My only gripe with this case is that there's no space to store extra batteries or any other accessories. It's got a small pocket, but I doubt that can store anything much."
1,Buy a better one at Wal-Mart,"This case is almost too small for the camera to fit into, found a much nicer one at wal-mart at a much better price."
3,Es muy pequeña,"Solo compren este producto si van a utilizarlo solo para la camara. Si quieren un case donde puedan colocar los cables USB o al TV, este definitivamente no es el que deben escoger. Solo cabe la camara."
5,Perfect for camera,"I purchased this case to hold the camera I bought for my granddaughter. Of course, it's the perfect size, etc, and she loves it."
4,very pleased.,"i bought the package deal , 8.1 mp cybershot, 4gb memory card and sony lcs-cst case on amazon. the 4gb card and the case came in quickly.the case came without any plastic packaging.just the case and envelope that it was sent in. a little bummed about that. "" but it was clean"" good grip, a belt strap that's stitched in. and a button release to give you access to a extra room if you need it to hang down your pant leg a little . also a ring on the top if you want it to clip on to something. the case fits like a glove on my dsc-w150 just enough room for a extra battery compartment pretty much that's all you need. very satisfied!"
1,Too tight for Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W55,"I think that other reviewers have said this too. This case doesn't leave **any** extra room for anything besides the camera. And it is bulky. I have aSony Cybershot DSCW55 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Black)camera.I bought it for an international trip, but decided that the extra bulk of this case wasn't worth it. I just threw the camera into an interior pocket of my backpack. That way it was easily available while still protected ""enough.""Don't buy."
5,Just What I Wanted,"My Sony Cybershot DSC-W90 fits perfectly in this little bag. And it has a separate compartment to place an extra battery and another memory card. I can loop my belt through it and when I need my camera, its easy and quick to get to. No fussing with a lot of stuff you don't need to have with you. If you want a well made, well padded bag to carry you small point & shoot camera in without all of the whistles & bells, then this is perfect for you. My wife now wants one to carry her camera is also. It protects the camera from scratches, yet fits nicely in her purse. The flap fits tight and secure via velco and you can get to it fast.I love this little camera bag for its ease of use and protection it provides for me camera."
3,"Nice case, but doesn't work well with the DSC-HX5V","This is a nice, sturdy case that seems like it would be great for the thinner W- or T-series Sony cameras. But is does not work well with the DSC-HX5V (or other H-series cameras) if you plan on storing an extra battery and/or memory card. The fit is too tight once the camera is in the case to make the zippered pocket useful. Beware if you are considering this based on the ""Frequently Bought Together"" group on the DSC-HX5V product page."
2,Not ideal for the cybershot camera,"I don't like this case - or really any case I've found so far for my new DSC-T100 camera. I put it in the junk drawer immediately - if it were more expensive, I'd take the time to return it. Problem is case doubles size of the camera for no good reason and that changes it from a compact thing that fits anywhere to something that is not. I think what you really want is a very soft case with shock absorbant qualities (like neoprene used in diving suits) vs. this case which has a lot of structure and heavy seams, etc. made of ballistic nylon fabric. If you are planning on dropping camera on the sidewalk or from the top of a building, this'll do the trick. If you aren't, save your money."
1,The Belt Loop Snaps,The belt loop snaps. It also unsnaps and that is why I no longer have a camera case. Fortunately my camera was not in it. I need something that can not come loose.
3,Way too thick for my Cyber-shot DSC-T900,"I bought this along with my Cyber-shot DSC-T900 because I needed SOMEthing to carry it in. I probably should have checked the dimensions more closely because this case is 3x as thick as my Cyber-shot.Also, there is a strap on the back, not a clip. The strap on the back is attached by a magnetic button and i would not trust it to hold on to my belt. Even if I did the whole thing is just to big and bulky for that. It would be like loosely wearing a small pillow on your belt.Not bad if you have a thicker cam or if you only plan to use it when you put the phone in your backpack/briefcase, etc. For something you wear on your belt I'd look elsewhere."
1,i didn't received this item,"please send it to me again, i really dont known what happend, this is the first time that happend something like this to me shopping at amazon"
4,A perfect fit for the camera.,"A perfect fit for our Sony DSC-T30B camera. Fits pretty snuggly. Wish it were just a hair bigger to fit in an extra battery, but it isn't that big of a concern. I like the fact it has a snap on belt strap, though I don't use that much as it usually just goes in my purse."
2,"Very Bulky, though very protective","Not a bad case, but it seems almost excessively wide, wider than it appears, though the actuall space for the camera is fairly small--my Cyber-Shot DSC-WX150 fit snugly inside. The width I'm sure is beneficial if you were to drop it, however it also makes it much more difficult to fit in small bags and there is no great way to hold it comfortably-the back is a tight velcro strap.I got this to use with my new Sony camera instead of my soft shell caselogic case, but ended up sticking with the caselogic mostly because this one was too large to comfortably fit into my bag.If you are looking for a hard shell case and dont mind bulkiness, this very well could be the case for you."
2,A ridiculously large case,It defeats the purpose of an ultracompact camera. This case if far larger then it needs to be.
2,Not a secure case,"While the case provides adequate cushioning for the camera it does not hold an extra battery, just barely enough space for an extra picture card. The major flaw in the case is the belt snap which easily and readily comes unsnapped! Velcro or a permanently sewed loop would have been a good solution for carrying such an expensive camera."
4,"Slim, stylish protection for your Cybershot","This little case is just that, little. There isn't much more to it than a snug, well padded pocket for the camera and a slim little zipper pocket in the front that won't fit more than an extra battery but what more do you need? Beware the customer photos - the selling point for me was the apparent shoulder strap but, the description clearly states 'belt loop' which I'll never use because I don't wear a belt. It has a strong metal loop at the top that I could attach a carabiner to and then link it to my purse strap; problem solved. A very well constructed and overall stylish carrying case."
5,nice holster style,Worked great on vacation to have the ability to whip out a camera fast and snap a shot in a moment's notice.
3,Good,"Cheap and simple.This is a good carrying case for cameras, it's not the first line lite the neoprene products but is good to protect and keep clean your camera."
2,good for compact cameras,this is probably perfect for compact point and shoot cameras. bought this for my bloggie. it didnt fit enough. was unable to close the velcro. would have been great if it fit my bloggie....
2,Is suggested as a case for the Sony Handycam - doesnt work,When I purchased the Sony Handycam Amazon suggested this case for it. It does not even fit the camcorder. Just watch what accesories they suggest you buy.
3,"Enough room for the camera, but not much else","I purchased this soft case to house a Cyber-shot DSC-W290 that I had just purchased from Amazon. The case appears to be well-made and fits the DSC-W290 perfectly. Price is fair for what you get. I do agree with others who have reported the front, zippered pocket as being too small. A spare battery won't fit in there and I wouldn't feel comfortable storing a spare memory stick in there either."
4,not big enough for w170 and a back-up battery,"If you have a w170 and a back-up battery you want to bring it along with you in this little case, you can do it, but the case will look ugly.May fit smaller cameras better."
2,"featureless bag w/Sony label, nothing more","i really wish that Sony would, along with the introduction of a new camera line, also engineer and introduce camera-specific bags...this bag is nothing more than your ordinary 'made in China' import, and is not form-fitted to any specific camerawhat's missing:- no wrist strap or neck lanyard- no accommodation for batteries- no through hole for strapwhat's bad:- uses a metal snap for belt loop instead of velcro- cheap finish inside w/poor trimming and single-stitching constructionNOT UP TO SONY QUALITY - RE-BADGED CHEAP IMPORT QUALITY!"
3,ok case,this case is not very good for my camera it is a very tight fit and no room for an extra battery in it too. i have the sony wsc-w290
3,Something Small,"The case is small for the camera, it is very tight and does not allow loading cables or batteries in it, I suggest acquiring a bigger"
5,Nice Addition,This is a nice case for your camera. I have a sony cybershot DSCW80 and it fits great. The price from amazon was also great compared to the generic ones that I could find at my local stores.
4,buena funda,"Muy buena funda. A pesar de que un dia se humedecio por la lluvia, la camara que llevaba dentro no sufrio daños por la humedad."
4,"Great fitting case, but beware the snap...","I love this case for holding my DSC-T100. The soft lining prevents scratches and I can get to the camera quickly with the Velcro closed top flap. My main concern (and it could be a big one if you aren't careful) is that Sony chose to use a cheap button snap for the belt loop. it doesn't require a lot of stress on the snap for it to open up and for the case to fall away. This happened to me several weeks ago at a hockey game and I was relieved that my camera wasn't in the case when it fell away. Sony should have used a better mechanism for closing the belt loop. Still, I liked the case so much that I went ahead and bought the same case to replace the one I lost."
3,"Ok, I admit it - I'm a Sony FAN. This one though......","I'm a Sony fan, own 5 Sony Cameras or camcorders at present (1 for me, 1 for the wife, one Sony High-end Camcorder for the practice, one for the family, and one older Camera that the kids use now). Bought this case for the w170 - fits, if a bit snug. Only issue is that it has open sides at the top which allow weather in and that's not ok in a case for a $250 camera IMHO."
2,too tight,"This carrying case looks cool, but I think it is too tight to hold my camera, so I somewhat worried about that the bag wore down the screen."
4,Fast recivied,This item i get unspected time. It is came on expected day. that's why i Liked it. I expect come fast like that other item.
3,Sze too small for camera,"This case has the acceptable quality for the price. However the measurements stated were not accurate. Having measured the camera I ordered it for, it should have been a perfect fit. It was actually too small."
2,Does not fit for the DSC-T99.,I ordered this product for the DSC -T99 and it is too big for my slim and sleek camera. I plan to send it back.
3,good case,The case is nice but a little too big for a regular pocket camera that i got it for. Not sure what they meant to use it for.
3,don't trust the snap,I purchased this case for my sony cybershot camera. The camera fits nice and is well protected. There is enough room for just a battery. There is a strap on the back with a snap to fit over your belt. While its easier to put on - it's also too easy to come off. The case would often unsnap and then work its way off. Either use the shoulder strap or carry the case in your bag. Purchase a case with a fixed belt loop if you plan on wearing it around.
4,Good and useful,Fits the camera perfectly (Sony Cybershot digicam). Soft at inside to protect lens. Has catcher to hang from belt.The only thing that you need to buy separately is the catcher to hang from your neck.
2,camera case,"I have the sony cybershot 150; the case is slightly to small, and unable to use front pocket..."
4,Good,This case has no wrist strap of it's own. It's light weight and is easy to open/ close with the velcro.
3,Nice holder for Sony S650,"It's nothing special, and it's a bit difficult to get small items out of the front pocket, but it does it's job otherwise. Fits the Sony S650 perfectly."
1,I am sorry,I am sorry to say that I have received the camera and the memory stick but I did not received the carrying case
2,Too small for the referenced cameras!,"Absolutely too small for the referenced cameras, works great for my cellphone."
4,nice,it's a nice cheap carrying case of the camera. the only thing 'wrong' is that i says the pouch can fit the battery....it can but it's really ard to get the battery back out. i'd say you should use that pouch for carrying your memory stick. other than that...does it's job
3,Cheap but tight.,"This is a cheap case and works great if all you want to carry is the camera. The only drawback is that it fits my camera, DSC-S500, so tight I can't fit anything in the extra pocket. I was hoping I could use it to store batteries or something, no way. The only thing you could prob. fit in there is like an extra memory card or something."
2,Undersized for my Sony DSC-HX5V,"Amazon bundled a battery and this case when I purchased the Sony DSC-HX5V. Problem is this camera just doesn't fit very well in this small case. The lens is slightly raised and the camera is just a little too long for this small case. The Velcros really has to stretch to fit and I fear that if clipped to a belt the velcro could come loose and the camera could fall out. I don't know if it was amazon or sony that suggested bundling these, but it is not a match."
3,slim carrying case for cybershot camera,"I bought this case for my Cybershot DSC-W50. It's a good case if you want to put the camera in your purse, or on your belt, but there's no room to put extra accessories, like a battery, or memory sticks. It has a tiny pocket for one item only, and there is no strap included to carry it around your neck."
3,Good case,"I bought this case for my Sony T10 (also recently purchased, I actually bought the case while I was waiting to get my camera in the mail). It's perfect size, not too big and not too small, actually if the camera was bigger it wouldn't fit so it's a bit snug I guess but the top that closes is a bit longer so it makes for extra room once closed. It's very soft inside so you don't have to worry about scratches and it opens wide so you don't have to worry about the zipper scratching anything also. The only problem was there wasn't an extension for the handle, but you can always buy one. I haven't yet but it's recommended to do so before a trip because the little handle on the case isn't much."
2,Camera Case for Sony Cybershot,The quality of the case is very good but it too small. The camera fits nicely but there is no room for anything else such as a patch cord.
4,Almost perfect,This camera care is rather good but sadly it will not fit neatly within my evening bag and although a touch to small for my camera it is of excellent quality.The manufacturing of this case is very good and it is an attractive product giving me good cause to put four stars in my review!
1,Sony LCS CST camera case,"Disappointed. The camera I bought it for did not fit in the case. I couldn't close it, its too small."
4,great for the price,"Great case for the money. Padded well and fits my cybershot perfectly... the only drawback is there is no neck strap (hence 4 stars instead of a perfect 5) -- BUT there is a ring to attach one in case you have one laying around. other than that, it's easy to carry or put on your belt. Definitely recommended."
5,Excelent Case,"This is an secure case, it protects the camera so good. and it is not hard, it is very soft. Good Buy! definitly, I recomend it!"
3,could be better,"i just got this item so i dont know how durable it is... it does not have a strap to carry on as a purse, but it has a nice look"
4,Cybershot belt carrying case,"it works great. just make sure your looking for a pouch that can only fit the camera & a memory stick because that's all you get in the case. I didn't realize it was soo small, but great product."
5,Very Solid Case,"This is everything most people say it is except the 1-3 star reviews. The pocket for another battery is a bit snug but for the money you cant go wrong. It offers very solid protection and has a belt strap which snaps on hard, to prevent damage, thus it won't come apart easily."
5,"AWESOME, rugged, long-lasting","Can't go wrong for the price, durable, belt loop strap with clip snap also.small compartment for SD chips. GREAT deal. Cannot go wrong with the Sony name"
5,Good product,I liked the case and fits my camera very well. I would recommend this product rather than other brands. The inside is soft which keeps the camera from getting any scratches too.
3,oooops!,"Dang! So, I ordered this item to PROTECT my brand NEW Sony digital camera and keep it safe. The SECOND day I have my (did I say brand NEW) camera I slide it into this case - all was good.I hook it to my belt loop - bad idea. I barely bent over, the VELCRO enclosure opens up, and out falls my - you got it - Brand New Sony Digital 10.1 megapixel DSC-W170 camera right onto the rocky cement parking lot.I can't go on - what a bummer!Don't use the ""belt loop"" attachment - there is too much ""play"" since it is so long. Of course, there's no shoulder strap either, so in order for it to protect your investment, without worries, you kinda gotta hold it.Low price though, and it is soft inside, and looks good on the outside. But oh, damn the velcro...."
5,Good cover for price,Good small carry case for new Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-W560. lite and compact makes it more usable to me with added protection.
3,Fine but does not completely encase camera,"This case does what it claims to do. The camera fits and it is well constructed. It does not completely encase the camera, though, which is something I would have preferred."
4,Very useful case,"After reviewing some cases for my sony cybershot t20, finally decided to have thsi slim case. it is very useful and gives a quality feeling when you touch the case. you can put extra battery or a memory stick to the front pocket. but you need an extra hook and strap for those who prefer a sling over a belt clip."
4,snug as a bug,"i was glad i finally sprung for a case for my 300$ camera that had just been hanging out in a box for months. The interior is soft and plush.The exterior, while NOT a hardened plastic still feels like it will hold up well to any punishment i will be throwing at my camera for day to day use."
5,"Very good, recommended","I ordered this for my recently purchased Sony digital camera (DSCW120). The case is well made and seems to be strong enough to last for a long time. The only small thing that I noticed is that I have to push on the camera slightly for it to fit in. I don't know if that is good or bad. May be the case is supposed to be this way, or may be because the case is new."
4,Great Protection,I used this camera case to take with me on a recent trip. I kept the camera in a back pack while travelling between cities and while doing longer walks. It kept my camera away from the elements and also kept it from getting scratched up while up against all kinds of other things. It was also very light so I didn't even notice it. Great camera case!
4,Nice Camera Case,Nice little camera case. I used it to protect my camera while traveling through Europe. It worked just fine. Only thing that would have been nicer is if it would have had a neck strap!
3,Nice and affordable,Bought this a few months ago. Dropped it on concrete a couple times and its performance was up to snuff.
2,Fake,"This one is fake. The padding, quality and feel of the case is cheap. Does not even have the tag inside like the real one I used to have. Where are the authentic ones?"
3,A little too small-won't hold a spare battery,"This case appears to well made and fits the camers well. My biggest gripe is that there's no room to carry a spare battery only a spare memory card. I'd think carrying a spare battery would be almost mandatory. Anyway, next time I'll get a bigger case."
2,Buy a zipper case,A tad bulky for what I wanted. I didn't review the product enough--I needed one with a zipper. It is an ok case.
3,Sony Camera Case,The fit is so tight on my Cyber-shot 230T that I am not sure if it is doing any harm to the view finder. Interior surface not too smooth
3,Just not enough,"It fits the camera fine, but could have been made with just a little bigger Accessory Pocket for the extra battey And memory stick."
2,Camera case is rather small,"I bought this camera case for my Sony DSC-W290. The camera fits snugly in the case and the case has a small compartment, which I used to carry my spare battery. Note that I had to insert the spare battery in this compartment before I could put the camera in the case (not vice-versa). The case is well-padded and provides good protection for the camera. But the case is too small to carry other options such as the video playback cable, battery charger and more memory sticks. Also, it would be nice to have a strap for more secure carrying. The only strap is the camera strap which protrudes from the case if you let it.I would recommend buying a different case if you need to carry such optional equipment. My other Sony camera case does have a long strap and more compartments, and is larger because the camera is an older larger model (DSC-P93). This case can carry all my cables, memory sticks and batteries."
4,Love this Camera Case!,"Bought this case for my Sony Cybershot. My camera is somewhat slim and I wasn't sure if it would fit but it fit in perfectly. I feel that my camera will be protected in this case, and its small enough to fit in my purse.Would def. recommend this camera case and its inexpensive."
4,Great Product,"The sony lcs-cst carrying case was a great prodecut not much i can argue but thought i came with a strap to hang over my neck. The insise is every soft good for protecting the camera on the go, contains a great room to zip close or open and grab a memory card.a strap possibly used to strap on your belt every neat. overall it was what i was a good case and saved like 5 dollars from buying it from the store."
2,Pictures are misleading; does not come with a shoulder strap,"The case is fine, but I bought it thinking from the photo it included a shoulder strap. This case is meant to wear on your belt."
1,This case is too small,Please don't buy this product. It is too small and I returned it for full refund. I bought a bigger sony camera bag at walmart for less money.
1,BUYER BEWARE OF ANTONLINE,"Do not buy your camera carrying case through ANTonline if you want to be able to sleep at night. ANTonline has NO reputable customer service whatsoever! No telephone number, only an e-mail where they respond with platitudes that ""they will open an investigation."" Meanwhile, I still have not received my purchase and have not been refunded. They are more concerned with policing and smearing their customers in the review section, than they are with actually responding to REAL complaints. Think twice!!!"
1,Does not fit,This case does not fit the Sony Bloggie. You should not pair it with the camera. Fortunately I had another case as a backup. Next time please check your product match up.
2,cheating,"The case is big and inconvenient.They didn't mention anything about shipping, but after paying they charged me eleven dollars for shipping."
3,good,this product very well and making very good pressure. however was not what esperava porfa vor placed over size productu (pictures).
1,SelfindulgenceParExcellence,Could not connect with Ms Previn. I reacted to songs drowning in self indulgence. Did not find the music particularly interesting either. But it does sound as though that 1970s Carnegie Hall audience loved her. I guess it was 70s solipsism.
5,Wimsey Whimsy,I had been looking for Gaudy Night for a long time. To get it with these other two stories is a great deal.
4,At long last!,"I have been going crazy waiting for these mysteries to come out on video. I have been calling PBS and BBC video over the years asking about this series.I am unbelievely trilled that they are not only out but on DVD. I love being able to jump to my favorite scenes and to have my movies in a format that won't rapidly decay over time.I rate this 4 out of 5 stars. I was hoping that as an extra feature, they would include the introductions and conclusions that Vincent Price would give before and after each episode on Mystery!. Sadly these scenes are not included. :(Everything else is wonderful and I look forward to enjoying many years with my DVDS."
1,sold as new it was obviously USED,"My box contains two copies of ""Strong Poison"" and one of ""Gaudy Night"" ... NO COPY OF ""HAVE HIS CARCASE"" IS INCLUDED ... I really feel that I have been cheated in several ways having been sold this as a ""new"" item which it seems not to be, it does NOT INCLUDE the pieces described and so is unacceptable. I'd like my money back as well as a written apology AND my copy of ""Have his Carcase""."
3,"Agreed, they're overdue and great, but...","Petherbridge didn't convey the essence of the ""book Wimsey"" as well as, say, Alan Rickman or Donald Sutherland (a little younger!) might have. E.P.'s acting seemed wooden, and a little TOO precious. However, a welcome addition. My old tapes of the of the shows are just about fried.I wonder if the producers of the series are aware of the prices we fans would pay for a really detailed and faithful realization of the novels."
1,CHECK YOUR BOXED SET BEFORE WATCHING,"There were supposed to be 3 different DVD's. The package I received had the first DVD and then 2 identical 2nd DVD's of the series. After watching DVD #'s 1 & 2, I put in #3 and only then realized it was the same as #2 so after watching all that I never got to see the conclusion. I've mailed the set back to Amazon and am waiting to see if they correct the error.The moral is to check all boxed sets and not to assume they are complete just because they're sealed.BTW the episodes I watched were very well done and held my interest but not seeing the ending is frustrating."
3,Good but ....,"The adaptations are good but, if you are a DLS afficionado, so much of the nuance is lost in the filming. Strong Poison and Have His Carcase are relatively faithful to the text. Gaudy Night derails in a major fashion - we never meet Lord St George, nor really would we (unless we already knew the book) understand how Lord Peter could possibly solve the crime on the information we are given. Edward Petherbridge is superb as LPW and Harriet Walter excellent too. Something to while away a Sunday afternoon - enjoyable indeed but not scholarly enough for true DLS fans."
3,Corliss,"I loved these mysteries when they were on television. I was greatly disappointed when I discovered that many of the scenes in ""Gaudy Nights"" that developed the relationship between Lord Peter and Harriet had been cut out. It was a real shame to have destroyed the integrity of the story, and the video should have been listed as ""Gaudy Nights, severely edited"". The other two episodes I enjoyed very much."
4,Almost as awesome as the books,"This would be a five star review if they'd done Gaudy Night in full. As it is, they cut out the chess set and Peter's nephew, which are two of my favorite parts. But besides that, these are nearly perfect adaptations of the books. He's great, she's great, the mood and atmosphere is perfect.I snuggle up with these and a cup of tea and I'm so happy to be in 1920s/30s England."
2,Disappointing,"I was excited when BBC produced these because I really loved the books, but although I taped them from TV, I have not rewatched the tapes because the BBC writing missed the essence of the books. While the actor for Lord Peter looks like his description, he is really goopy - though the writers are not to be blamed for moving Strong Poison from winter to summer (much more visually appealing), they totally unnecessarily change Dorothy L Sayers writing of the conversations between Lord Peter and Harriet from witty to romantic drivel, depriving the viewer and eliminating the dignity of the characters. I agree with the other reviews on the poor characterization of Bunter. Gaudy Night in the hands of BBC becomes a different story entirely than what DLS wrote. I wish someone would produce a version that is true to the books."
2,Lord St George missing/ Bunter mis-cast,"THIS REVIEW IS REALLY ONLY USEFUL FOR THOSE WHO HAVE READ THE BOOK --Plus side: 1.genius actresses playing the Dons;2.Excellent Peter and HarrietCons: 1. THE SCORE ALONE WILL MAKE YOU CRINGE!!2. The character of Lord St George, pivotal in the book, -- completely gone.3. Bunter (who isn't even in this book) is horribly mis-cast -- he is no well-bred valet; he's a cockney who took a wrong turn on his way to do the Lambeth Walk in the west end.4. The guilty party (OK, we read the book, we know who it is) has a couple of scenes, that, as written, take her whole story away, and, actually, make it not possible to have the same outcome. But, yet, we have the same outcome.recommendation: watch with the remote in one hand, to mute the music, and to fast forward over Bunter.the series with Ian Carmichael and Glyn Houston are much better."
5,Finally! Superb dramatization of wonderful books!,"I've been waiting 12 years to see these! I didn't ""discover"" Sayers until after these aired on TV. ""Gaudy Night"" is among my favorite books, and this version is excellent. Harriet Walters is wonderful as Harriet Vane; Edward Petheridge shines as Wimsey. The Oxford dons are wonderfully casted--they looked as I imagined they would. As with any dramatic version of a novel, some subtleties are lost (such as the subplot concerning Peter's young nephew), but overall these are outstanding interpretations of Sayers' novels. Nobody does this type of TV like the Brits! Highly recommended."
4,A Wonderful Version,"Edward Petherbridge (""Nicholas Nickelby""; ""Strange Interlude""; ""Gulliver's Travels"") and Harriet Walter (""Sense and Sensibility"") are perfect as Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. Petherbridge breathes new life and vitality into Dorothy L. Sayers' deceptively foppish, monocled detective, and Walter portrays the conflicted Vane with convincing angst and desire. Richard Morant, who plays the faithful Bunter, gives a low-key performance which perfectly conveys the valet's fierce dedication to his employer. There are a few false notes (""There rides the man who fills my hot water bottle and cooks like Escoffier!""), but on the whole this is a terrific adaptation of Sayers' books."
3,Always get powder!,"Okay - I was going to give this two stars, but I'm giving it three because it shipped SUPER fast, which was great. Also, I really like the bottles and tips for application - I really never was a fan of the cones.HOWEVER - I think this henna was old or something, because it did not create dark stains at all - and I followed the instructions to the letter.Will never buy premixed again - going to just get the pure henna powder from now on and deal with the mess!"
4,Great Product,I ordered this for a henna party. The shipping was super fast and the product was great! I like the premixed so I didn't have to deal with the hassle and mess. It comes with everything you need to do henna work.
4,really good cd,"messy marv putting it down features daz, e40, and dr. funkenstein himself george clinton you like west coasdt hyphy-g funk get this with the good uncle mjam putting in work with some of his disciples."
2,great plates ... if you send them back several times,"i was hoping to get a set of 8 of these, the first 2 boxes came and had broken plates in both of them; i kept 1 good set, and shipped back the broken set; the replacement set came, and more broken plates ... so i think i'm just going to settle for a set of 4 rather than trouble with having to go back and forth with these until i can put together a full set of 8. it's really a shame."
2,Don't stand up to everyday use,"We have had these dishes over two years now. I was really attracted to the color and design of the set and I purchased service for eight. Over half of the salad plates have broken easily, the bowls and large plates have chipped just from stacking. They scratch and scar from knife use. The dishes get very hot when microwaved. Also, they suck the heat from food when it is served leaving many dinners only warm by the time it's all plated and served at the dining room table. We warm the dishes in the oven or mic before serving quite often. We will soon be using the remaining intact pieces at our second home. I am currently researching dish sets that are sturdy and elegant, Fiestaware may soon be on my dining room table. I wouldn't recommend this brand."
1,Dont waste your money,These plates chip in the dishwasher and got all scratched. They also. cracked in the microwave. They get very hot and the food still isbt heated. My sister in law bought the same set and the same thing happened to her. I would never buy this brand again!
2,easily breakable,"My boyfriend and I just moved into our new apartment and we needed some dishes. We fell in love with these but when we got them home, we realized that if they barely touched each other, they broke very easily. I didn't read the reviews for these because I thought, ""ohhhh I love these and it should be fine."" I regret my purchase."
1,breaks and chips to easily,I have purchased 5 sets of this dinnerware. It chips and breaks very easily. The last set I ordered to replace broken plates arrived with 4 out of 8 plates broken already. I will be replacing this set with another brand next time.
3,"Beautiful design, not sure about quality","We ordered two boxes of these dishes last year. They have great design, and the avocado glaze is beautiful. We also had problems with breakage during shipping, which was a pain (although Amazon replaced the broken pieces). After some use, I'm noticing grey metal marks on many of the bowls and plates. I've tried to remove using baking soda, but I think that is dulling the finish over all. I've also noticed that the cup really gets hot if you heat it in the microwave -- not safe at all. Next time I think I will go with a better maker of higher quality china."
2,Very Disappointing,"My husband got me these dishes for my birthday eighteen months ago. Since then, half of these dishes have broken for things that would not have broken glass. At least three plates have broken just from being washed in the dishwasher- you go to take the plate out, and the plate has cracked down the middle and the bottom half stays in the rack. A couple more of the plates have developed cracks deep into the surface so that they cannot be completely cleaned. I was so excited to get these beautiful plates, but they are not worth the money. They are heavy and therefore seem like they'd be more durable, but they are not. Even knocking a plate onto carpet will shatter them. Unless you have no children or dogs or houseguests and don't use a dishwasher, don't waste your money."
2,Not microwave safe,"We bought these dishes approximately a year ago and am just now beginning to see a disturbing trend. The plates have been breaking when we try to use them in the microwave (they claim to be microwave safe). It isn't consistent, but happening enough that we've now decided to no longer use them in the microwave. Our best guess is that since the bottom of these plates aren't fully glazed, water might be soaking into random portions of the unglazed sections and expanding through the heating in the microwave.We're very disappointed with a product we were originally very happy with. We spent a good deal of money on this set of dishes (our first new full set in 20 years). Now we have to invest in several plates (Pyrex?) that we can use and be sure are microwave safe. What a waste of money."
2,You Get What You Pay For ... Buy American,"My wife and I liked how the Sango Concepts Eggplant stoneware looked, so we bought 2 boxes (32-pc, 8 settings) of it from our local BB&B; with coupons. Multiple pieces in the boxes were broken or chipped, so we had to get those replaced immediately after purchase. Knife marks from cutting show up easily in the middle of the plates. A year later, a plate actually cracked down the middle while microwaving something. This was the last straw, so we returned them to the store for credit. We decided to pony up and get something really nice, so we purchased theLenox Tin Can Alley(white) bone china, which is still made in the USA. We now have quality dishes that should last us for years and years, and we can be proud that we're supporting jobs on American soil -- there aren't a lot of dinnerware makers left here!"
1,poor quality,"claim to be dishwasher safe but having had our set for only 12 months 3 plates have now cracked completely in two in the dishwasher, not of merchantable quality"
2,Chips & Cracks,"Chips and Cracks easily. Nice looking, but would not buy again. Would help if you could by individual pieces so that you could replace what has broken."
1,These plates mark with normal use of steel utensils,"Using stainless steel utensils with these plates and bowls results in black marks all over the surface that can only be removed with hand scouring and Bar Keeper's Friend. If I could give this product negative stars, I would do so."
3,"nice, but sadly they don't last","We got 2 sets of these dishes as wedding gifts a couple years ago. We picked them out for our registry at Bed, Bath, & Beyond. The first year they held up well...only one cup chipped. But after two years, we have less than one complete set and will soon buy more dishes but definitely not these. Although we love the look, the quality is lacking. I think for the price, we should get more than 2 years of use. It seems that part of the problem is from cleaning them in the dishwasher...they're supposed to be dishwasher-safe, but over time, apparently the heat causes too much stress. Little stress cracks started just showing up on some of the dishes, and before long, those cracks turned to breaks.Sorry but I can't recommend these if you want them to be usable for any decent amount of time."
1,Junk - Cracks in the microwave,I bought 16 place settings just under 1 year ago and have lost over half of the plates and a bunch of bowls to cracks. Tried contacting Sango but that is basically impossible as they are somewhere in Indonesia. I just threw the rest of set away and ordered a more restaurant quality type dinnerware.
1,Garbage,My husband and I bought these with a wedding gift card and I wish we wouldn't have wasted it on such cheap junk. We bought them because of the color and we assumed they would be good quality hence the price...Ya not so much. They started cracking about 3 months after we got them. All the bowls have fracturs in them. I just earlier today I knocked one against a glass while taking it our of the dishwasher and it split in half.
5,Great everyday plates!,"Purchased for everyday use, these plates are great! They hold up well in dishwasher and have a substantial feel to them.The accessory sets make great additions as well!The packaging was effective as not a single piece was cracked or chipped."
3,Bad Packaging,"We ordered two sets initially. One came in a slightly larger box and the contents were undamaged. The other came in a smaller box and contained a number of broken pieces. We requested an exchange and the replacement set also contained a number of broken dishes. Two out of three sets with broken pieces is not a good record and the packaging of these dishes doesn't seem to be sufficient at all for shipment. The set itself is nice, the dishes are a good size and shape and the color and style matches our decor well; however, I would recommend picking these up from any number of local retailers rather than having them shipped. It may cost a little more, but it will save you the hassle of having to return them."
5,Lovely and strong,"I am not sure why so many reviewers say these chip easily. They are our primary dishes and though you can't bang them around together as hard as possible, you can bump them together putting them away, or they can bump in the dishwasher and not be totally trashed.They are absolutely lovely in person but more blue than ""eggplant"". Also I love the bowls because when you put hot food in them, or heat them up in the microwave, the top stays cool so you can easily pick them up, regardless of the heat of the food inside.They were a great purchase and at $50 a set, a bargain."
2,Dishwasher safe?,"I bought 2 sets of these Avocado dishes about 1 year ago at a local department store, so did not have the breakage problem others describe due to poor shipping.Appearance-wise they are very nice, but when washed in the dishwasher, several pieces became crazed (plates and cups) and a cup broke when hot liquid was poured into it. They claim to be dishwasher and microwave safe, but the sets I have are not.Two stars for poor performance."
3,Ok - a bit heavy,I'm enjoying this set but have some reservations about buying more. They are a bit heavy. Overall the set is well made and can withstand a couple of blows.
4,excellent quality and design,"Having guests for dinner friends\family complemented the Sango set. Its design makes it a great set.the bowls are specious and good weight,Plates have a fairly high lip which keeps foods on the plate. value for money for your own table or that of a friends as a gift. Well packaged for security of delivery. 4 stars and a big thumbs up on this product."
2,"Good materials, when they're not BROKEN","Beside the broken bowl that was in this order, i like the set.I DO NOT like the customer service for Amazon though, they are not helpful and are not useful."
1,Really wanted to like these,"My husband and I put this set on our registry and received it broken. They were great about sending us another package quickly. However, after a short while a large plate broke in the microwave (even though they say microwave safe). We have only had this set for a little over a year and now our silverware is leaving marks all over the plates that you CANNOT get off. So, now we have an incomplete set that we're afraid of warming up food in the microwave and looks CHEAP because they leave marks on the dishes!!VERY DISAPPOINTED! :("
1,Cracks and fissures,"Purchased from from BBB 3 years ago online. 1/2 the set was broken on arrival. We returned them and got another set. They arrived intact. Since then we have had several broken, cracked, and chipped pieces develop. I am now looking to buy new dishes. These dishes do not wear well for a small family (4 of us). The bowls cracked first followed by the large mugs. I would notice fissures and then cracks. Plates held up the longest. Loved the color but, just not durable."
1,Not durable,"We bought 2 sets of these plates locally about a year ago because they looked great and were on sale. We are now seeing the same issues other people have reported. We have had one plate crack in half and on the remaining dishes, you can see scratches from the silverwear. To top it off, it seems the finish is flaking off the inside of the bowls. This product looked very nice but just isn't worth the hassle. We don't have any kids so we know the product hasn't been abused in any weird way. We would not recommend them to anyone."
1,Brittle Stoneware that breaks way too easily,"I bought 2 16 pc. sets about 3 years ago to have a service for 8. I have 3 mugs, 3 bowls, 4 salad plates and 6 dinner plates remaining and all are chipped. These dishes crack and chip very easily. The stoneware seems very brittle. My old cheapo no name set lasted at least 8 years and I got tired of it. Thank heavens I got these during a half price sale. I also did not open a box to look at all the pieces first as they were not displayed. The dinner plates are HUGE and the bowls are too big as well. The plates could be used as chargers. My husband and I have taken to using the salad plates to eat off of to avoid overeating! The glazing has crazed. Color is very pretty. That is the only positive thing I can say about this set of dishes. I would never buy this brand again. They are not at all durable."
2,Would not recommend Sango dinnerware.,"Purchased from Amazon three years ago. After several broken, cracked, and chipped pieces, I am having to buy new dishes. These dishes do not wear well even for a small family (we have four in ours). The bowls and salad plates were the first to go. I noticed after some use, fine fissures would appear which obviously weakened the dishes. They lose their attractive quality very quickly. I obviously do not recommended them, and because of my experience with this Sango product, I am also avoiding anything by this company."
5,CUTE,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! I ended up buying the whole collection - great prices and worth it!
2,Ugly Cat,"This is one ugly cat!! He looks much cuter in the picture - in reality he's scrawny and UGLY! All the adults who saw it were a bit disturbed, but my 3 year old doesn't seem to notice so oh well! Weird delivery too - UPS said it had delivered it when it was supposed to but it didn't come to my house until almost 2 weeks later. Good thing I'd ordered early for Christmas!"
3,"Good Creation, but small forces","This recording of the Creation is great if you like a smaller, intimate sound. I prefer a larger force to convey the drama of the story. To my ears the tight, controlled sound is too sterile and subdued, lacking spontaneity and vigor in the choral parts especially. As another reviewer mentioned, this is partly due to the use of boys for the treble voices, but I believe it's also simply due to the small choir and orchestra. I have this recording because it's in English (in the old classic version which I am attached to!) and therefore more accessible to my kids. However, the version I keep for the sheer joy of hearing this piece in its true glory is the Karajan version with the Berlin Philharmonic, with Janowitz, Wunderlich & Berry. It's in German, but transcends language!"
4,"Yes, please, more Morgana","I love most things she does (did), but when, oh when, will there be a reissue of A Taste of Honey? I have an old audio tape of this album copied by a friend years ago and I wear it out, especially the track of Lazy Afternoon. Bliss."
4,Books worth having in the home,Great info and great projects to set the boys to work with. Skills like the ones required for this type work just aren't popular anymore.
4,Interesting.,Not a field manual. This book has a lot of outdated info and some cannot be utilized easily today. I do like it for some of the crafts. I probably would not buy this book again if I had an older boy scout manual.
1,A Big Letdown,"This game is nothing like the previous games with the same title. They took out a lot of the old features and replaced them with a talent show. You can't pick up the cat. You can't breed them anymore. You can't have more than one cat out at a time it seems. There's a money system. The 3D graphics are the only real good thing about the game.If you like the old versions of this game, stay away.If you want to train your cat to do tricks, dress it up, and decorate your house with set designs, you might like it."
2,Catz,"There was an earlier version of this game, it was much more entertaining. I am disappointed in this newer version."
3,Ok - Needs Improvement,"The game in itself is not that bad. However, I'd agree with the writer of a previous review. If you've played the earlier CATZ or DOGZ game do not expect the same thing here. Yes, the graphics have improved but they've changed the content quite a bit. Overall, it's still a pleasant enough game and kids will get a kick out of playing it. As for the other reviews commenting on the difficulty or their inability to install the game, I'd like to reply and say that I have had no problem with the computers in my house. There are two computers in my house running Windows XP and this game installed without a glitch the first try on both of them."
5,Looks like it will last forever,This is not a very complicated product so not much to write... I use it as a key ring. I like the way it looks and it seems like a very high quality product. I know I look funny wearing this on a belt loop but with 3 little kids it's many times a very practical solution and I prefer to pay a few more bucks to get a high quality product that I know I can count on not to break.
3,a wee bit on the big size,i wish this had some type of scale next to it the only thing u have to go on to base the size of it is the 20mm gate stated though it wont serve the purpose that i intended to buy it for i make make it into a makeshift brassnukl as i can fit my hand through it some para cord and some fishing line and rubber tubing. I should be able to carry and use for defensive purpose as well as for other emergency situations when u need some cordage though at it may not be that easy to conceal
1,Wrong picture,"The picture does not show 70933 kit, it shows 71933 kit. 70933 is open end lug nut, 71933 is closed end one. If you are, like me, looking for closed end lug nuts DO NOT buy this product."
5,F a n t a s t i c o!!!!!!!!!,"This DVD is fabulous, the production, the settings, the Videos, the quality; everything. I believe the only other awesome original video that was left out in this collection is the original Amante Bandido video; other than that, this collection is a must-have for Bose's fans.The feature I loved about this DVD collection was the additions in Italian, French and English (4 videos); that is something I was not expecting and was an absolute surprise.Get it at once!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Pricey,"I bought these originally thinking the price was for 10 (the Amazon ad did say that and I ended up getting them for free, but I digress). These work just fine if you're a waiter or bartender, but for something I generally scribble all over and then throw away, close to two dollars a pack is a little expensive. I found a ten pack at office depot for about ten bucks and with no shipping."
3,Guest Check,"Good description of the product. The checks are user friendly, durable and great for use at any restaurant or coffee shop."
3,Nice Hat,"Its a nice Beanie, but its smaller than I thought. I do not have a large head and its snug on me. Still overall it looks nice and the reversible option is nice."
5,El único libro con frases célebres originales y maravillosas,"He leído todos los libros que se ham publicado sobre FRASES CÉLEBRES en español...Pero son tan célebres, que todos los libros tienen las mismas, arregladas de manera diferente !Este CONTIENE FRASES EXTRAORDINARIAS, DESCONOCIDAS, DE SABIOS ACTUALES Y ANTIGUOS !De este libro, obtenemos más sabiduría que se todas las universidades. Yo lo llevo a todos nuestros viajes y lo he releído mil veces. Es uno de esos libros que se atesoran para siempre...Se los recomiendo a todos los lectores de habla hispana: ¡DE VERDAD !"
5,UN LIBRO PARA VIAJAR,"Este libro te será de compañía para cualquier gira que realices, es hermoso ya que te enseña a comprender y amar a los demás ..."
4,"Pleasant surprise, good read","I had no idea that Johnny Cash had ever written a book, and to find out that he wrote about Saul of Tarsus was even more of a surprise.It was obviously well researched, and it was well written. It kept me interested and gave me an interesting perspective on the whole subject.The introduction was very interesting as well, and certainly gave me new insights into Johnny Cash. I recently also read his daughter's autobiography, which was excellent, and his introduction touched on some of the things she wrote about, so Man in White came along at a perfect time for me."
4,Excellent book.,"I was surprised at the level of research that Johnny did on this book. It was a great read and I'm glad I made the purchase. It gave me many insights that I did not realize about the Apostle Paul. I highly recommend it, especially if you are a Johnny Cash fan."
1,Not worth the time!,"The writer mentioned that this book is suitable for high school kids to adults. I'm a college student. Personally, I think the advices contained in this book is more applicable to high school kids. The style of writing appeals more to high school kids. This book do not contain much detail either. Man, if I still do not know how to use a library (the author teaches this!) or a computer by the time I reached college, I had better kill myself. These obvious things are just not meant for college students or adults."
5,excellent,"as always, everything I expected from Kveldulfr's books. He is as always, one of, if not THE leading authors on Teutonic history, religion and magics."
4,Sylph-like Scarlatti.,"What a variety of approaches keyboard players bring to the performing of Scarlatti`s sonatas! A bonfire or a fireworks display might typify some of them (including those of several famous harpsichordists). Russian pianist Evgeny Zarafiants favors a more sylph-like, languid approach. K 419 in F sounds droopy here, and the fine gossamer of K 112 in Bb floats loosely.Repeats are observed, according to the policy adopted for this on-going complete Naxos series. K 478, one of the few Scarlatti's sonatas marked ""andante e cantabile"", thus extends for more than eleven minutes as played here. K502 in C is made to sound more robust than other sontas in this selection. Has anyone noticed how the first half of this sonata seems to borrow themes from Handel's ""Water Music""?Zarafiants' Scarlatti recital might not be my favorite in this Naxos series so far, but it is a well-filled CD and contains some less familiar items."
2,I Still Go There,"Its been 30 years since first hearing Dory Previn - I've gotten older, but probably not grown up very much. Finding (on Amazon)the CDs of the LP albums and the even rarer cassette albums, was like going home - manna. I can take Dory only in short doses - in solitude - and when I'm not going to have to talk to anyone for a couple hours. Soon I'm going to take a vacation and spent one whole day listening and recovering and the next day re-entering and looking forward to the next session. Thanks Amazon."
1,what was I thinking?,"Twenty years ago, I owned Mary C. Brown on tape. Naturally, it disappeared over time but I always remembered it fondly. When I came across it here at Amazon.com I thought it was great. But now, after listening to it for the first time in twenty years all I can think is ""What was I think back then?"" Now I find it tedious and poorly sung. It seems to strain for the intellectual rebelliousness that was popular with some (me included) back then. Now, it just seems disjointed. Oh well, its another example of the past being better remembered."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"People, don't waste your money. All of these recipes can be found online replaced with cutesie frivolous names. If you want to make these recipes just look them up then make up your own ""cheap"" and ""easy"" names to give them which is what you will feel like after getting this book and then watching it collect dust on the bookshelf. Only one or two original recipes that I saw. Also, I got mine used to save a few bucks and it looked like it came from a library so maybe check there first."
2,Curls after a day,"My 3 dogs love to play with discs. The size of the Dogobie was ideal. The disc has a small lip around the edge which makes it easier for dogs to pick up. However, after only a day outside the discs (which arrived flat and flew straight) curled up and do not flatten out. Although they still fly, the flight trajectory is way off. Disappointed dogs!"
2,"Three stars, but not the same as a real frisbee","In my previous review I only gave the Dogobie 2-stars. I now need to give it at least one more star (Amazon apparently doesn't allow you to edit the # of stars). While I still find that the Dogobie does not fly like a real frisbee (it's not rigid enough and easily warps), it has been my young collie Sophie's favorite fetch toy for a while now. I am occassionally able to make a decent throw that she can catch. Sophie is a show dog, so I'm concerned that she may damage her teeth on a hard frisbee. The Dogobie is a safe compromise."
3,Just ok,"Bought these for my Border Collie. He loves playing with Frizbees. Not the best quality, but then again they were just his xmas stocking fillers. Wouldn't buy them for dogs who love to chew."
5,excellent,we've bought these for our pups for years. they love them! the product is as promised and as always is excellent!
5,Best throw & catch disc for my dog!,"THis is a soft frisbee-style disc, so it won't cut your dog's mouth or gums. It flies perfect if you throw it right, just need a little practice like any thing else. My Weimaraner bolted at full speed (which is FAST!) and would just get to it in time or it would hover long enough for her to catch up and enjoy a leap in the air! We tried many types of discs, this was/is the BEST by far! Great for the beach, it floats. Great for pavement, it bends. Great for long distance throwing too! Speaking from experience, this is a great product for your athletic pooch!"
1,Dogobie Disc,"Disc is flimsy, doesn't fly very good, is just a waste of money. The dog rejected it! Wouldn't think of purchasing this company's product in the future."
3,fun in the water,"erratic flight, curves a lot. goes far though. my shepherd can tear this quickly. he likes it though, so is gentle. has lasted for a year with constant use. multiple tears, but operable. however, i primarly play with him and this in water strictly. floats very well, very visible. this gets thrown into the river and lakes and no problems. for throw and catch in the air, i like the kong frisbees more, being more aimable and consistent trajectory, but does not float. durability will always be an issue with these toys, but they are not indestructible. but being cheap, i stock up."
4,Whippets love Dogobie,Aerobie DogobieTM Disc - YellowThis is our second soft Frisbee for the whippets. They love the soft feel. The blue version isn't holding up as well as the yellow but both are still working well at 6 months old. The blue has a lot more tooth marks.One whippet loves to shake it vigorously while bringing it back so the discs get a lot of abuse. The other whippet is a good catcher. Whippets are very fast and prefer the low fast and long throws. They will easily run down a 30 yard fast low throw. Of course this type of catch requires 2 or 3 victory laps before they bring it me. Its a great exercise tool.
1,These things sink (and stink),"The material on these feels great - and I believed it would be a good alternative to the hard plastic frisbees. I was extremely disappointed to find that they don't float at all. When you throw them, they begin to sink immediately; if you want to throw it any kind of distance, you have to really huck it. Unfortunately it also means that your dog won't be able to get to it before it hits the ground. I'm pretty sure you need greyhound-like speeds in order to catch these at a distance.They are easy to pick up for dogs - which is good because they certainly won't be able to catch it."
4,FUN!!!,"This toy is no more than the soft lid off a wide mouth container however, my dog had a blast with it. Soars like a frisbee and is easy for him to pick up and run with.He is a chewer so I don't know how long it will last if I leave him alone with it."
2,Does not float,Purchased two discs for my dog to fetch while swimming and they sink! Major disappointment as now they are useless to me.
2,I can huck...,"On the hunt for a disc that will hover well in reasonable weather as my dog gets really fired up when he has time to chase/catch it in the air. I've noticed after playing with this disc for a couple hours that as it softened up it would tend to shoot up vertically when thrown with velocity. If I tossed it lightly it would stay parallel to the ground but wouldn't fly far enough to excite my dog. Started out a great flyer but ended up a dud...OTOH, the SuperDisc was a GREAT floater but cracked within 20 minutes after my dog rolled over it trying to snatch it up."
2,Cheaper and Less Durable...,"My border collie mix has played with the Dogobie Disc for the last 5 years. It's perfect...straight flyer, easy to clean, and puncture resistant. I purchased a new disc this month after losing her old disc. The current product is a cheaper less durable product...wobbly flier right out of the package. After 1 week, the product is punctured. The only good thing I can say about it is it's easy to clean."
2,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"After the FIRST play session with my Aussie, this frisbee was left bent and looking years old.Go with the Kong frisbees. They are MUCH more durable. I have had one of those for almost two years and all it takes is a washing with warm soap and water and it looks brand new.Would NOT RECOMMEND this product."
2,Not worth it.,"This thing is no frisbee. It lost it's rigidity, the little it had, after about 5 minutes. Becomes so floppy it's very difficult to throw. Also, there is no hard edge for the dog to easily carry it back in their mouth. It falls out too easily leaving the dog having to pick it up again and again. Flies very poorly. Pros: Easy on my dogs teeth and if your dog is fast, they can catch it easily due to it's softness. But I can get $1 frisbees at Pet Smart that are far better than this thing. Not worth the money."
5,A beautiful depiction of real life struggles!,"Sylvia manged to capture all emotions in a real-life, down-to earth story of her life."
4,SeaLife ReefMaster PRO Set,Great camera as far as point and shoot goes. Although you can save money buy direct from SeaLife.
2,I just recommended the SeaLife Reefmaster...,"....over the Canon Elph. It works at a greater depth. This makes it more versatile at only a slightly higher cost.However, the ""Pro set"" is [no bargain]. Just buy the camera instead."
1,Just because you CAN make a movie doesn't mean you SHOULD..,"Oh dear, where do I begin? I caught this movie on cable and it was so mind-numbingly awful I couldn't take my eyes off it. The plot, and I use that term loosely, is about a bunch of guys with too much testosterone running around and blowing stuff up after a SEALS wife is murdered. Then you have the trucks hanging from cranes for no reason at all, the indestructable SEALS running around shooting about 900 rounds from the same gun without reloading, the lumps under the bad guys shirt that are obviously squib panels....I could go on and on but you all get the idea. Don't operate heavy machinery after viewing."
1,U.S. SEALS,"Very poor movie. Looks more like a made for tv movie for TNN. Not accurate at all, they don't wear the correct uniforms, are never identified as SEALs...and don't use realistic weapons. No matter what the job they are always using AK-47's and 1 shotgun....for CQB? What happened to the HK Mp5's and SD's? Very weak on substance and plot. This film was worse than the Showtime channel's ""Operation Delta Force"" movies. If you are looking for a SEALs movie with something good to offer get ""Navy Seals"" or ""The Finest Hour"". As far as this one STAY AWAY!"
1,worst movie ever,"If you like the REAL Navy SEALS you will hate this movie. I bought it and threw it away, I didn't even want to give it away."
3,Everyone should see this film!,"Man I read about this flick when I was looking at the bottom 100 worst films ever on imdb.com. So I decided I had to check it out. My friend Will and I rented it and we weren?t disappointed. It was so bad we couldn't stop laughing. With the ""Concrete"" bunkers that move when you lean on them, the awe inspiring aim of the ""good"" guys and the ability the ""bad"" had of some how always be aiming where the seals feet used to be (why aim for the feet?).After the movie (no joke) we actually called blockbuster and asked them to get this baby out of the action section and into the comedy. But they said to do that we had to talk to their regional manager or some such. Man but I have to tell you this movie is worth watching just for how incredibly bad it is. They some how manage to blend a 1960's effects with the plot of porn it's just amazing. But I just couldn't see giving it more than 3 stars, after all it wasn't intended to be a comedy."
1,should be U. S. Snoozers,Looks like it was made in a low budget eastern European country by low budget cast and crew. Absolutely no research was done to make these guys even start to look like the teams. An insult to the mentality of viewers and military forces everywhere. I shut it off after 30 minutes. Please don't do anything to support this film. Hope the real seals go after the filmakers for treason.
2,U.S. Seals,"Not a good movie...hard to follow...weak plot. BUT, it does star Ty Miller of Young Riders fame, so that was enough to keep me watching the whole thing (not much, I know...)"
4,good item - lots of specific instructions,"Had bought these for my brother in law and he liked them so I bought myself some. They are great but when they came there were all kinds of instructions with the oven mits. Seems like something that wouldn't need much instruction but...that is not the case. If you follow the instructions, they are fine. They do take a little getting used to because the ""grip"" is different from any other oven mit I have ever had. If you read and can follow instructions - you're set."
1,these absolutely suck,"the first time we used them our hands did get burnt, plus the heat scorched the red side of the mitts. do not waste your money!"
2,Buy Duncan Euro Design Instead!,"I bought these on clearance at BB&B; and will return them ASAP. I gave my husband instructions on proper use and warned him to be very careful not to touch the colored side to any hot surface or it would melt. After giving my lecture, I realized that the manufacturer should have put the colored fabric side to the inside and the black neoprene side to the outside. Oops! Well, it turns out that the manufacturer realized the same thing I did and now makes a Euro Design version that has black neoprene on the outside and the colored fabric side on the inside. Don't buy these. Spend the extra money and buy 1 or 2 of theDuncan Euro Design Chef's Mitt, Redinstead!"
3,"rope hammock with red bolster pillow (or in this case, without)","The hammock is very standard and will last, I'm sure, but I am disappointed that it did not come with a pillow as stated in the description. I picked this particular hammock specifically because of the pillow!"
2,Lies!,"These DO NOT come from ewins, the come from a third party source which isn't that good at making hammocks. Don't waste money on this junk!"
2,Wrinkled,I like the size of this item but it was extremely wrinkled. I ordered a bunch of posters at the same time and did not have a problem with any of them except this one.
3,"Nice Optics but Failing ""Rubber Armoring""","We like the optics of this pair of binoculars which offer a bright and well magnified image. Even viewing under low light conditions is fine. Another good feature is the autofocus with which the user only needs to adjust the eye diodes for all viewing.Compared side by side with a Nikon 20x60 scope we also have, this model wins hands down with the optics and construction of most of the other parts.The downside, at least for the pair we have, is the ""rubber armoring"" started failing after about 2 years of use. Mind that we only use it indoor while this model is supposedly for ""military/marine"" use in adverse outdoor situations.First the rubber armoring coat on the right hand side became slacken. Later, the rubber at the right thumb holding position broke into a hole of the size of a silver dollar to expose the plastic shell of the binocular barrel. With the failing rubber armoring, I surely doubt if the binoculars are weather-proof anymore."
4,Smaller than frame,"This poster is about an inch smaller than the frame I bought in the same size, but looks good in my sons room"
3,"""timing belt comp kit""","Though it implies that it does and a check with customer service stated that it did; this ""comp kit"" does not include a timing belt"
2,Too ethnic.,"Couldn't get past the smell and thickness to figure out if it works for my hair- waves. Might be good for other things, though, as volumizing."
5,new,Worked great. got it fast and cheap and love it!!!! I now have so many songs on my phone! Love it!!!
2,More worn than advertised,This was a used book. The cover was spotted and there was a personal message written inside the cover. I was led to believe that it was in better condition.
3,Mopar Muscle Cars,"The video was fun but the contents is reduced to few cars, I expected more models for example Barracudas fro 67 to 69 generation, so is false when the DVD ofers more than it really has."
5,A dog lover's review.,"I loved this book. It was a warm, sensitive, and informative story about a man and his dogs. It was the type of book that would make an excellent Christmas gift for some one who has had or who once loved a dog. It was a book that made you both laugh and cry. In the end you are happy you read it."
5,Flawless Performance,"I've used both the 2GB and 4GB versions of this card in my Nikon D200 for nearly a year and it has performed flawlessly. I did not purchase these cards from Amazon, but from a local camera shop. Having never heard of this brand before, I was a bit skeptical. They offered it at a very good price and used the card themselves with no problems. I have pushed these cards to near their limit and never lost an image. While other cards appear to have a more prominent reputation (e.g., Lexar and SanDisk), they do not match the performance of the RiDATA CF card for a similar price or are far more expensive. I feel like all I am paying for is the advertising. I'll be buying more of these cards so I am able to take up to 1,000 images in a day--that would be 3 more 4GB cards. Highly recommended."
1,Don't use with the Maxxum 7D,"If you are using a Max 7D, DON'T BUY THIS CARD! It will fail after about 130-140 frames if shooting raw + small jpg with no hope of recovery. Not sure of life expectancy if shooting in other than raw and sm. jpg. The card will be destroyed. 2 cards tried with same result in both cards. Other RiData products are of similar service quality. Write/Read errors start to occur after just a couple of uses. That's my experience with RiData CF cards in a Max 7D."
3,Not what it looks like.,"I'm not completely happy with this ring. Although it is a great size and mm width and it's flat band, it appears darker in the photo, which is why I bought it. But when it arrived, it is so shiny and white colored, it looks like it's plastic. Like it's from a quarter machine at K-Mart.Oh well, I guess I'll keep it as a back up in case the ring that I am really in love with now gets lost. A black band ring made of Stainless Steel; Surgical Grade 316L. It rocks."
2,Agree on paper path problems,"Prints well, good size, scans, etc., but I completely agree that there's a major design flaw with the paper path. We've been having the same problem at my small office with multiple pages going through at once. We've tried a couple of different papers, but it doesn't sound like that's going to help. This problem doesn't make it unusable, just a constant source of annoyance. Thanks a lot HP."
3,If you're looking for answers...go elsewhere.,"Having been introduced to the concept of ""Viewpoints"" in a weekend directing workshop, I was eager to read more about it. After reading this book, I know less about ""Viewpoints"" than before I started. If you're looking for an insight into how Anne Bogart works (and she very well may be very talented - I don't know, as I've never seen one of her productions) you won't find it here. There is much discussion about ""the Viewpoints"" and referrences to ""the Viewpoints"" and even definitions of ""the Viewpoints"", but as far as what Anne Bogart does WITH ""the Viewpoints"" I have no idea. One reviewer is correct - this book is a love story, written by people who think that Anne Bogart is the Messiah of Modern, er Postmodern Theatre. If you're looking to join in the lovefest, by all means, sign up. If you're looking for insights into how to work ""the Viewpoints"" into your work...you'll be disappointed."
2,some of you are talking about A Director Prepares,"These are supposed to be reviews of Viewpoints, the book about Bogart's technique. Some of you are reviewing A Director Prepares (which I recommend more). Don't get mixed up. They're very different texts."
1,"Ohhhhhhhhh Lordy, when will it ever end?","I know Anne well and was curious to read this book. Obviously, everyone who wrote for this book loves her, so the book is basically a love story, about people who love Anne and why they love her work. Too bad. So many of her productions have been failures; so much of her work is over the heads of the general audience. Too many people love her work without understanding what it means; they love the energy but miss the message. Why? Anne admits it herself, her ultimate failure: she believes her audience is beneath her, that it is her duty to correct her audience's limited view of the theater. Anne, when are you going to start making plays for your audience rather than for yourself?"
2,Ho hum,"Lord Peter is rich, powerful, a genius aristocrat, and devoted to Harriet. It is a female fantasy that is repugnant. No wonder women have trouble in real life relationships; if this is the fantasy of their heart no man can fulfill it or come close. Ich! Unless you are completely immature, avoid this like a plague."
4,Ian Carmichael is the only Lord Peter!,"No offense to Mr Petherbridge, but I grew up watching Mr Carmichael and he is so much better then his successor. IC is supposed to,play an older Wimsey and does a great job in ""Five Red Herrings"", and ""Clouds of Witness""Harriet Walters is great as Harriet Vane.My only complaint is, why weren't there any other LPW/HV mysteries made"
1,"This is a phony book, with phony reviews!","BEWARE! This ""book"" is a self published booklet that is totally BS. Someone has been writing all these five star reviews -- and vote them ""helpful"" -- and I'm not going to venture into guessing who it is. This is absolutely unethical. Do not buy the book. Do not believe in this crap."
4,How to make money in the Stock Market,"Easy to read and peak your interest in index fund investing. Good historical data without a lot of fluff. Short and easy to read and understand. Plus, it gives a great list of additional investment reading selections. Can easily be read in one sitting."
5,Down with financial pornography,"This book demystifies the investment process through one stunningly simple fact: if you buy and sell stocks yourself or buy into actively traded rather than passively managed index funds, you are going to lose a huge percentage of your gains due to taxes on the trading that you or the fund sustain. Don't believe the one-star reviews. My guess is that they're spam written by disgruntled financial advisers."
1,Horrible book,"Now we know why the Baptists will be in heaven first...The ""dead"" in Christ shall rise FIRST.(I saw that on someone else's review and just had to use it)Just because miracles, signs and wonders have ceased (or never existed in the first place) in John MacArthur's church, doesn't mean that they ceased for the rest of us. God is still confirming His Word with signs following! I've seen hundreds of miracles and healings.. and I've heard testimonies of people being raised from the dead after being dead for over 6 hours!"
2,Difficult,This puzzle is very difficult to put together. My husband and I have been trying to put it together for about a week and a half and seem to be going no where.
4,puzzle,a good well built puzzle thats gonna grow with my son and I this ones gonna take a awhile lots of pieces but a good challenge for both of us to master together
5,Beautiful picture...great puzzle,"Ravensburger puzzles are always top quality, and this puzzle is no exception. My daguhter <6> loves helping me with it...and can't wait until it's finished.You can't go wrong with this puzzle...or any Ravensburger product."
3,Pieces Missing,"I just finished doing this puzzle. It took me about 2 weeks working an average of 4 hours per day. I really like it now that it is done. The colors seem very realistic and the puzzle looks beautiful. I feel that if I stare at the dolphin's eye long enough, it will pop out. Just my wild imagination. That said, I am giving this 3 stars because two pieces were missing. I know I didn't lose the pieces because there were two duplicate pieces instead. I now feel like my puzzle will never be complete but I don't want to take it all apart for a refund."
1,Baby Einstein-World Animals,"Dear Amazon:I am having a big problem with this order!!!!!!!!!I have never received either one of my Baby Einstein DVD's!!!I have also not received Baby Einstein- Baby Noah!!!!Please help me to get my DVD's. I can not afford to not receive the items I have already paid for almost 2 months ago!Please help or please send me my items I have already paid for. The post office has never delivered these items to me!Sincerely,Karin Comstock"
2,Not as good as other Baby Einstein Movies,"World Animals is not as good as their other movies. We also own Baby Mozart and Baby Santa and those are excellent! It seems that creators decided not to put lots of effort to make the World Animals movie. Most of the movie is just short footages of different animals. Basically, when you watch this movie, you get a feeling that you are watching either Discovery or National Geographic channels!"
5,My two year old loves this DVD.,"She loved the Baby Mozart and Baby Einstein videos when she was a baby. I had not played her a Baby Einstein video for a long time before I picked up the ""World Animals"" DVD.She absolutely loves animals, so this DVD really catches her attention. The music is great, the visuals are very attractive, and my daughter really enjoys watching it.I highly recommend this DVD for any child who loves animals."
2,Disappointed,"We have 2 other Baby Eistein DVD's (Wordsworth and Animals on the Farm) and my 16 month old loves them, so I decided to get her another one. I was very disappointed with the World Animals DVD. My daughter doesn't care for it, will only watch a little at a time, nothing like the other 2 I have. There doesn't seem to be much educational purposes to this one, doesn't do animals sounds or anything. It just says the animals name, shows wildlife footage of it w/ classical music in the background - that is it!!Again, disppointed."
2,Downhill since Disney takeover,"If you own Neighborhood Animals you will be VERY dissappointed in this release. NA was released under the original company, while this release was under Disney. Lots of corner (and time and footage) seem to have been cut. The segments are short, and the ""digital flash cards"" on this DVD are IDENTICAL to the ones on Neighborhood animals, so you get cheated on that...I won't be buying any Disney Baby Einstein releases after seeing how this one was SO short changed."
1,scares my kids,"We own pretty much every baby Einstein DVD and LOVE them all ... except this one. We first showed it to my twins when they were less than a year old and they were petrified of it. Now they are two-and-a-half and I thought maybe we would try it again. Same response.Baby Noah is much, much better overall anyway. If you want a ""world animal"" type video, I would suggest that one."
2,Jane on the vine,"The lion was dancing but Jane, he was very funny. He turned his headAnd puckered his lips. On the monkey's ear we saw a flower there. What could it be if you were on the vine and you had a bad dream? Jake loves world animals. Jane could be naughty to me."
4,The download on the Fashion industry!,"This is an interesting and well written business book about the fashion industry and some of its most important designers. The author describes the growth and changes in the fashion industry and the changing role of the customer and the designers. The books material is mainly focused on the US marketplace and the different stand-offs between ex. Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren, the growth of Armani and the Italian designers, and the decline of the French. The main thing is that it nowadays more comes down to great marketing and expensive ad budgets to stay successful, that great design techniques. Overall great insight into an industry mostly concerned on hype and over inflated egos."
2,The End of Fashion,"This is a gold mine for the person who has an interest in the history of the business of high fashion. For the rest of us, it was less than spellbinding. The author has done her homework and with documenting her quotes from various fashion designers and experts in the economics of the fashion industry. It reads like a combination of The Wall Street Journal, Vogue Magazine, and someone's Master's Degree Thesis. There were a few small, uninteresting, black and white photographs of fashion designers grinning next to their famous, rich clients. Personally, I would like to have seen some colored photos of some of their work. As a lay person I had no idea what these people created or why it is supposed to be so great. The claim of the book is that The Fashion Industry just met its demise in the 1990s. I'm not sure whether we will ever be completely free of fashions, but I do know that my interest died in this book long before the last page."
4,Good Book,"So this is the second book I've purchased on Amazon. This one came faster than I expected which was cool and was in good condition. The only problem I had with it at first was the highlights and underlines that were in the first chapter but it really didn't end up mattering. Actually, it made me feel more comfortable to write in it since I'm reading it for a class. The book itself is amazing and I recommend it to anyone who is studying fashion or fashion business. A little outdated at points but considering it is talking about a specific period in fashion history it's not totally inappropriate."
3,Packed full of fashion trivia,"This book had a lot of fashion industry information and was well written in an easy-to-read, enjoyable fashion. There were sections in the book where I became bored mostly due to the amount of information being presented at once. This occured more with the chapters on designers I wasn't particulary interested in so other readers may feel differently. There were also a few designers in the book for which I wished more of their back story was presented but I suppose there are always biographies for that."
4,BACK FROM THE BEGINNING,"This is something new and different. Good concept, having the book in screenplay form. I like the conflict between the two family members. It was really visuall, well written. I definantly recomend it.It's a goog buy."
4,Foreign language cuss cards,They were a bit more than I expected. Need a sense of humor with these. The group of 18yr olds traveling in europe thought they were very funny.
5,Perfect Daughters,"This is an incredible book, it has hit on so many feelings and things that I, myself have been going through, wish I had know about this book earlier in my life, it would have made things a little easier to cope with, thank you for writing it. It should be shared with everyone whom has had an alcoholic parent."
3,Missing pages,"This was actually a very helpful book. However, I would recommend buying it in print. The were missing tables in almost all areas, the would have made it even more helpful."
2,So-So,"I have been having a lot of the issues that other ACOAs go through. I have a tendency towards perfectionism, sometimes to the point of not even starting something, because I know that I wont be perfect at it. This book, while interesting to read, wasn't enlightening. I didn't really learn anything from it that I hadn't learned from other more informative ACOA books, and I felt that it didn't fit me and my issues. It also seemed very generalized, for a book specialized towards ""perfect daughters"" It covered a wide range of personality types, and the ways that a daughter of an alcoholic learns to cope, just not what I 'thought' a perfect daughter was.It would be a great book for those just beginning to explore this subject, and could probably give some a feeling of not being alone in their pain."
2,This book is a dud,"Most of the quotes are uninspiring and sophomoric, but it deserves two stars because it looks good on my bookshelf. Here's a quote to consider: caveat emptor..."
4,"Expensive binding, 14173 pieces of wisdom.","""A great book should leave you with many experiences, and slightly exhausted at the end."" I bought this book because it was on a discount huge sale and the binding looks so great on my shelf. Once I got it home I find that I frequently find wise quotations on lots of subjects. The topics are arranged alphabetically from Ability to Zeal. I find that I sometimes pick it up and just read a few quotations, and invariably find them interesting and inspiring, or sometimes funny, but never dull. If you ever need a quick source for a quote on almost any topic, say ""books"" for example, just look in the book. Not just for business, but for lots of your life."
2,Don't waste your time,"I too was a bit skeptical of the cattal mutilations when I first heard about them, but Kagan and Summers's case against any alien involvement was extremely weak. Their book does not offer any alternative solutions as to what causes the cattle mutilations and makes the assumpetion that everyone that doesn't agree with their views is a liar. This book comes close to slandering emmy award winning journalist Linda Moulton Howe and is simply not worth the time it takes to read."
2,Disappointed,"If you're a fan of cool jazz you may find this CD interesting. Personally, I found most of the tracks to be atonal and inaccessible."
5,Danger Within,"Solid, credible writing matched with a fast-paced and suspenseful plot. Danger Within reels the reader in with an insider's view of the commercial airline industry. Mr. Danielson's experience and knowledge of the industry provide the framework for a great piece of writing...easily understandable to the reader with no aviation background. Especially relevant after 9/11, Danger Within lays bare the increasing threat of airline terrorism on a global basis. Thrilling read!"
5,A fast paced & Exciting read!,"Danielson's well written book, is laced with the ""realism"" of what obviously stems from the author's ""real life"" background as a professional aviator, as well as ""insider"" knowledge, unique to issues of airline safety and the commercial air cargo business. Highly recommended!..."
4,Good Suspense,"I really haven't been much of a fiction or mystery fan but Danger Within quickly hooked me into a long reading session, right up to the end. The story extracted every ounce of suspense. When reading for fun a lot of action is great and Mark kept up the drama. I enjoyed the book and recommend it to others."
3,Danger Within,"As with any book I read, the author has to grab me right off the bat. Mr. Danlielson failed to do this and I had a hard time figuring out who was who in the first third of the book. After that, I was hooked especially when he brought in the Navy, as I am a Navy Veteran. His writing style is easy and smooth after the first third of the book. Great story and suspense."
5,Have the cd also.,"Love the cd so I bought the dvd. Have a collection of music dvd's. Just love music, live bands,live shows. Try to go to as many as possible."
5,Groundbreaking concert!,I have this concert on cd and vhs and plan on getting on dvd. This is an awesome groundbreaking concert and was one of the very first acoustic concerts. Keep in mind the Tesla-Five Man Acoustical Jam concert took place a year or two before the MTV Unplugged (acoustic) concert series. This concert may very well have opened the door for the MTV unplugged concerts and other acoustic shows. If it wasn't for the Tesla acoustic concert there might not have been the MTV unplugged concerts or any other acoustic concerts.
5,Best Damn Acoustic DVD Around,"This DVD captures the band in a peak performance. Truely a must have, truly TESLA!"
1,price is crazy!!!,"if you go on the actual western store website, you can actually get this same product with a case for $150.00 whereas people are selling them here for $160.00 and thats without ANYTHING!!!"
2,Well below O'Neil's other work ..,"Is basically a brief introduction and outline and then many examples. The examples are all mostly from the 2000 decline in the market. So the book outlines a very specific approach and highlights examples that fit that approach.Given the cost of the book , I don't mind having it in my library. So far the best book on short selling was written by Justin Mamis . The book by Kathryn Staley is great as well. The focus there is how to look at the balance sheets and corporate shenanigans. Both these books are not light reading though."
5,"If you do not understand short selling, get this book","The author gives readers solid information about how to sell stocks short. Most individual investors rarely understand shorting, but some professionals are proficient at it. During the 2008 bear market, some of them made a tremendous amount of money. Many people probably heard terms such as the ""Uptick"" rule that has been debated among politicians. I have read several books on shorting, but this one explains the ""Uptick"" rule the best.The reader provides pretty much all the information during the first 43 pages. The rest of the book is dedicated to case studies of companies that have been great short selling successes in market history. I highly recommend this book to readers interested in short selling.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
2,It is what it is...,"Man, there is so little information on selling short. I bought this book so that I might understand the concept better. I don't.If you love looking at charts, Monday Quarterbacking good opportunities to have shorted stocks during the tech burst of 2K, this is a must-read for you! Now I'm not saying that chart examples aren't useful, but that's just about all this book is.Make no mistake! This book WILL make you millions selling short. Just crank up your trusty 'ol time machine!Oh brother, Bill!"
1,Not what I thought it would be.,"Book did not go over the margin call requirements of selling short. I had to figure that one out on my own from several discount broker's websites. Also, this is primarily about technical trading (chart reading) which does not interest me."
2,Disappointed,"TA is only as useful as the person who interpretate in real time.However, this book is mostly of hindsights. It is still ok for$13, though."
3,Not enough substance,The book is a few pages of what to look for in a short candidate and the rest is over a hundred different stock charts.
3,"Short on Analysis, Long on Charts","I enjoyed this book, but found the authors torehash their analysis of stock/market tops, adnauseum, then fill the remaining pages with lotsof charts demonstrating their analysis.Maybe the first few chapters said all there is toknow about the subject."
5,Basic introduction to short selling,This is a primer to the perils of selling short. It has the caveat of how the market can punish you for being short and alerts you to the fact that you are liable for the dividend payments while you are short. A must-read for all serious traders.
3,Need to read O'neil's other books first,"This book is okay, but not his best. It is a bit repetetive with respect to his other books. However, I think his advice on chart patterns is invaluable! If you are not into technical analysis, this book is not for you. However, if you understand the importance of analyzing stock charts, you'll love this book. Many reviews complain about the fact the that the book is mostly examples of historical chart pricing patterns. However, technical analysts understand that repetitous chart examination of past winners(or losers) is the only way to learn to reconize current winners(or losers)."
1,One major disappointment,"This book falls completely short to all everything I expected from it. William O Neil is also the author of the classic book on growth investing: How to Make Money in Stocks. This book was really great, I've red it several times and I've got a lot of useful stuff out of it for my personal trading.I thought this book would be kind of similar in scanning for short candidates, but it just doesn't help one bit. In his first book (how to make money in stocks) you'll find pretty much the same stuff as he covers in this book. Just read the part on `when to sell' in that book, and you've got a pretty good picture of what is written in this book.The whole thing counts just 20 or 30 pages with material on shorting stocks, the rest just shows huge price charts from stocks that have crashed.Not helpful at all and not recommended."
3,Whu?,This book is not at all graduate material. Reads more like it should belong either in high school or as an undergrad book.
5,Whips,If you want to gain knowledge in leather work this book is for you. It is clear and concise. plenty of illustrations to keep you on track. good info on folk history in Australia.
5,Great book,"This book is realy great! It contains everything you need to know about the construction of whips(stockwhip, snake whip, Bullwhip), In addition, a variety of unique and special knitted techniques-includes plaiting names in whips ! It contains a number of pictures that show everything to the smallest detail. This is the best book of its kind on the market for sure."
5,Overall a great guide,"For learning how to make whips out of leather, this book is pretty much the first to buy. There are a couple minor differences with the book vs. what most people do--Edward's use of kerosene or neatsfoot oil in plaiting soap is one, most persons online don't recommend that--but overall this shows ""the way it is done"" and with the proper materials will allow you to roughly duplicate any professional whip you might find (-you won't duplicate the level of *craftsmanship* of a professional-made whip very easily, but you will be able to do the correct cutting, braiding and the more-common types of knotting-).It does not say much about the techniques of making nylon whips, so if that is your primary goal there may be another better book out there."
1,can't set,"this thing won't let me set it. the instructions specifically say to make two 90 degree turns counterclockwise, and only one is possible. it is stuck at 0-0-0 and is proving impossible to set. the instructions suck, not worth the money"
1,had to get hotel staff to hack saw it off,Yes i did remember the combo number code lock. Too bad the the master lock didn't. I tried for an hour in my hotel room to unlock it but was unsucessful. Had to get hotel handyman to come and hacksaw it off!!!
1,XPW not worth buying or looking at,"XPW offers some of the worst wrestling around. There hardcore matches are too ridiculous, and not believable. They don't show entire matches, only highlights, and they try to sell the whole thing with sex. Not worth buying. I would recommend JCW Video's instead."
1,very disappointed,"Hook up was easy, the vcr synched it's clock with my cable, then the machine stoped working. I got 30 minutes of use out of it before I had to put it back in the box and send it back to amazon.com. The VCR powers it self off after about 2 minutes of being turned on. It will not insert tapes."
1,Don't waste your money!,"It's about 99 days old and there is no sound at all and even new tapes look like they are at the end of a 10 year Bl_ckb_ster life cycle! (It was like that about 2 weeks ago but I fought with the manual, remote control and cabling just long enough to run out the warranty!) I'm going to get a quote on the repair but will probably just bin it and learn that sometimes manufacturers manufacture to a price point - even if they aren't any good at doing that.The unit feels cheap... and it has turned out to be so."
1,Please don't waste your time/money on this JUNK,"How could this foul piece of machinery get a decent review from anyone is beyond me (do they work directly or indirectly for Toshiba - or the imposter that actually made this thing?). Why the heck did Toshiba put their name on this thing? Maybe I just got stuck with a lemon, but all I can say is this thing just did not work, period. The Auto setup thing was a joke - but when I tried to setup manually, that was it. Nothing worked....I'm sure no consumer wants it unless it works well."
2,Can anyone explain?,"I run this VCR through a Bose home theatre. All dialoge sounds ""gated"" or there is a buzz that follows speech. I am using high quality cables. If not for this I would say it's a good deal. bhasinc2@yahoo.com"
4,Very Satisfied,"I have had a VCR just like this one for a couple of years. It has provided impeccable service and quality, especially for the price. Some of the reviewers who have indicated the machine did not work seem to have not connected it properly or have TV systems, etc. too old to properly connect to today's technology. I like this player so much that I am going to order another one for our kitchen family room area. It is a great price and great deal. I also own a Toshiba DVD player and love it."
1,Does not close and no screen cover,"This case makes it very hard to get the phone to turn off when closed and there is no protection for the screen. It is a simple, slick case that grips well. The return fee of $2 makes it a buy it and keep it item. Shipping cost is the hidden cost."
3,Not that good,"This cover does not allow the phone to close properly and everytime it is moved (ie: in my pocket) it wakes it from sleep mode. The battery dies within a day with mimimal use. It does protect the phone, but I have seen a harder cover that is a little slimmer and works better."
2,"Yes, it doesn't close..., but","Yes, it is true that this product does not close properly.... BUT it looks like the problem is the top part only.. I cut the bottom half of the both sides of the top part with scissors, and now it closes properly. Maybe you can try this."
3,Katana cover,For the first few days it was just fine. But it did not hold up to constant pocketing and un-pocketing.
5,Very Satisfied Customer,"Cover fit like a glove, snug and very flexible. Look forward to buy from again."
5,Love Goodyear Belts,"The goodyear belts cost more, but I have found they are worth it. They feel better built and last longer. Overall a very nice belt."
2,mixed feelings,It came in a timely manner but it came folded and crumpled. I can't get it smoothed out to put on the wall.
4,Gary Puckett soars,Great product for those of us who remember the soaring voice of Gary Puckett. These two albums contain many of the songs that allowed Gary Puckett to outsell the Beatles in 1968. Beautiful reproduction of the original recordings.
5,What a GREAT double album,"Oh my! What an album. It brought back soooooo many memories (some good some bad). But the best ones were of seeing Gary in person. What a talent, and he hasn't lost any of his voice over the years. I was so pleased to get some of the songs that haven't been available on other compilation albums, such as ""Now and Then"", a novel approach for a song, and you can hear the pain in his voice as he sings. Wonderful. I would recommend this to any ""geezer"" from the ""golden age of rock and roll""."
1,Excruciating,"Excruciating is an appropriate word for this, even if it comes close to being sacrilegious. This sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. No reverb, no vibrato (orchestra or singers), boorish balance and engineering, mushy diction. It's like having your eyes pinned open in a white-painted cement block room with hundreds of fluorescent lights."
3,not the one I was looking for,I was looking for the first edition of this book. The first edition was written in operator speak rather than scientist speak. The second edition is unnecessarily technical and difficult to understand.I am still looking for the first edition.
4,Excellent book for practical users of reverse osmosis,"This is an excellent manual for anyone interested in designing and working with reverse osmosis plants. It is almost up to date, has good illustrations and case studies. I hope Mr. Byrne will update it and bring out a new edition with the new improvements in the technology. Also, ultrafiltration as reverse osmosis pretreatment should be considered. All in all, a very decent book."
1,emery337,"so i bought this xbox arsenal assassinator light gun.i would have not bought it if i did know it was not going to work on my xbox.the plug on it is incorrect,should be better discriptions of product before a person buy's anything such as this.now i've wasted my time and have to return and that take's forever..."
1,Poor Quality Product,"This item was used for less than a month when the top, plastic frame supports collapsed. It looks nice, but it is poor quality merchandise for such a high price. A sturdier wardrobe (with no wheels) can be purchased at Wal-Mart for a fraction of the price. This storage closet was sent back to the vendor and they refunded the cost of the wardrobe and shipping."
4,Durable product,"Tupperware is a good product. The company has been around for a long time. The cereal bowls was a good buy. They came with tops, so I can also use the bowls to store other food items. I have not had any problems with the bowls."
2,No re-sell,"As with all e-books available from Amazon, you cannot sell your book to someone else when you are finished with it. You can loan the book out, but what's the point in loaning a textbook for 14 days, and only one time, at that?"
1,the e-book is glitchy,"The actual text book is alright, but I rented the e-book ( because the price was so much better). Honestly, it's been really awful. I could basically deal with the places where the text got mixed up in the math equations and stuff, because if you try hard enough you can figure them out. I finally got completely fed up when I was trying to finish my math homework and I came to a problem that was completely missing the integral ( as if that wasnt enough, there were like 5 parts to the problem that were all based on that one non-existant integral) I ended up having to write my professer a long note about my stupid glitchy e-book and substituting the invisible integral with the one in the previous problem. Basically, I can deal with issues until they start impacting my grades. Then I get upset. This needs to be fixed."
1,Google beats textbook,"It just has to be repeated one more time that this book is unhelpful and useless.This book may have a wide variety of problems as some people said, I don't really have anything to compare it to in that sense.Mostly though it's like this. Math comes pretty easily to me and these calculus classes are no exception.I'm doing fine in my calculus class and I'm understanding the material.BUT. This book is useless.Every time I have a question the book has been useless. I mean, I come across something foreign or confusing and I page through the book like I'm used to doing, the problem came from the book after all. Pretty much every time though I come up blank and Google it.My teacher is alright at explaining calculus.The internet, turns out, is pretty great at it.This book however is totally useless at it."
1,Worst Textbook Ever!,"I don't usually write reviews, but I feel the need to soothe others who are struggling through Calculus using this useless, overpriced book. If you are having a hard time, it's not because you are dumb - you probably have this horrid textbook coupled with an ineffective teacher like I do! All I can say is get a supplement book or two (which sucks when you have to drop so much money on this stupid book for your class), but it's worth it if you want to get through Calculus and end up with some understanding as to what the heck you just learned and how you can apply it. This book will NOT teach you that - I have even found answers in the back of the book to odd numbered questions that were so simplified and bizarre as to the logic of how they got that answer that our university math tutors couldn't even figure out the train of thought. Book sucks but there is hope...with other books and good teachers!"
1,Absolute Trash,"I had to buy this book for my calculus 2 course. Despite the reviews, I thought I would make the best of the book. I really tried.I love calculus, and I have never wanted to burn a book until I came across this overpriced piece of garbage.As an edit: I got an A in my Calculus II Class, thanks ONLY to Paul's online calculus notes and Wolfram-alpha. Sadly, I have to use this book for calc III.... After that I will burn it.For the techies: While I am not condoning this, I thought I would mention that someone has uploaded the 5th edition to the torrent sites."
1,terrible,"This book is required for all the calculus classes at my university which is unfortunate, it has some challenging problems ill give it that, but the examples/explanations are TERRIBLE, it explains the easiest and most basic version of the material and then expects you to be able to figure out their extremely challenging problems, I don't even bother looking at the examples them anymore. Only buy this book if its required for your class, if you're trying to teach yourself calculus this is not the right book for you because you will learn nothing."
5,Great,"After I ordered the book, I had to contact with her in regard to the change of my address where the book needed to be sent to.She got back with me right away and sent it to the address that I asked her.Also she sent me a student solution manual book free of charge along with the book.I'm really satisfied with her service.Thank you, Angela!"
4,4 star,"basically the same as the newer 5th edition, I confirmed. would recommend.reason for missing star: condition of book was quite worn. I would have liked a better copy, but I bought one of the last remaining."
3,Calculus info,"book is not bad. If you have trouble understanding math, I would suggest you get the ""single variable calculus, 6th edition"" the 6th Edition has much better explanations. And more pictures :D"
1,Regarding Kindle Edition Only...,"Faculty please note: the Kindle edition has typographical problems. Some characters appear to be dropped. Also, unknowns are never emphasized (italicized) and very often - especially with $t$ for some reason - they are run into the succeeding word. Most of this can be worked out fine by a reader who is comfortable with the material - but isn't the primary audience for a textbook students who by definition are NOT comfortable with the material? All in all, it's a appalling job of converting a text book that costs over $90 to download (and so won't cut into their profit margin with resales). I will have to think twice about buying a Kindle book from Wiley again. About the book itself, as content, I have no complaints, so this bad review rests squarely on the production staff. Oh, and by the way, Wiley: if Amazon can take a book off my Kindle, you can get them to update it with a fixed version. Do it, and I'll happily pull this review."
1,A Bad Book,"This book is terrible. I used it for both calc 1 and 2. The University of Connecticut used this book for 3 semesters and than decided it was junk. Most of the math department hated the book and for the spring 07 semester they switched to the James Stewart book which is used for multivariable.The problems are very hard and often the chapter does not show how to solve or give you strageties to solve them, the book does nothing well and is just an expensive paper back book with a horrible solution manual."
1,Awful,"This is probably one of the worst math books I've ever had. It introduces difficult concepts and then provides minimal and confusing explanations. Each chapter plugs through several examples that leave you even more confused. It also assumes that you both understand and remember everything from previous chapters, and if you're not good at math like me that won't be the case - which, of course will leave you even MORE confused. It gets to a point where a lot of the people in my class read the chapter and get nothing out of it. DON'T GET THIS BOOK!!!! And PLEASE, if you're a teacher don't force your students to use this piece of crap!"
2,A really really dry calculus book,"While I do not expect calculus to be much other than dry, this text was especially difficult to read and follow. The chapters were very short but that is probably because the explanations were so brief. The problems were not broken down into easy to understand steps at all. Considering that this is a Calculus I book I, and other classmates, felt that there could have been a lot more explanation on the problems. I did, however, take the course online, so there was also no actual discussion involved in my learning. That said, I do not think that the book is effective for independent learning at all."
5,How I Learned Calculus,"This calculus textbook provides challenging sample problems and clear proofs for calculus students. It highlights the main points well, surrounding each must-know point with an extremely helpful blue box (actually you could probably learn calculus by just reading the blue boxes). Exercises range from easy to very challenging and from random to practical. While most of the problems can be done by hand, a graphing calculator is necessary to get the most out of this book. For those taking AP Calculus, this book covers both AB and BC."
5,Very satisfied,I was very happy to find this item priced so reasonably. My search for a NEW book started at $150.00. I ended up paying less than 10 bucks for it. Very satisfied.
3,calculus book,The book got moldy but its kind of okay too read.condition is okay just hoping it didn't have mold on the bookthank you for the cheap price tho :D
2,Not worth the 125 dollars,This one is definitely not a bargin. There's water stains and many sketches in it. I would rather use the book shared in the library rather than using this one-- you can tell how poor it is.
4,Garmin GPSMAP 378,"The 378 is first and fore-most a marine chartplotter. With the exception of radar, the unit has every feature found on the much larger units we use on-board a 32' research vessel. Display is readable, even in direct sunlight; screen regeneration is very fast.When used on the road, navigation is no different than any other Garmin GPS (it uses the same RoadNavigator software package). The only negative critique is that b/c it does not have a touchscreen, inputting waypoints can be somewhat monotonous. It also lacks some of the more useless gimmicks - my position indicator is only an arrow, I can't get an animation of a truck up on monster tires.This unit is clearly meant to be a highly functional, no gimmicks navigation tool. Because of all the features and its range of uses, you will need to spend some time with the manual to take full advantage of its power."
2,Garmin GPSmap 378 is a Discontinued Product,I purchased a Garmin GPSMAP 378 in June 2006 and paid about $1300 for the unit and some extra maps. Really liked the unit until I went to update it in Apr 2010. The only map updates available from Garmin are over two years old. Garmin will sell you this old update for $70.00. Garmin no longer supports this product and will no longer provide maps according to the Garmin tech rep I spoke to on the phone. Why would anyone want to purchase this product or any other top end (expensive)Garmin product that will be obselete within two years of the purchase date??
3,loaded GPS,"Loaded with lots of information. Would be easier to use if touch screen. Marine lake detail did not include my favorite lake which is the second largest in its State (44,000 acres). Bummed since I could not find a list of the covered Lakes at the Garmin site."
5,Painting Watercolours,I have never really painted with watercolours until I read this book and it made the transition into this medium with ease. I heard constantly that is medium is difficult to control etc. The techniques described in this book broke that myth for me and I have been using it to compliment my photographs.
4,I like it,"It came on time, but the case was cracked. My grandma will love it for her birthday this year in May"
1,Not the teacher's edition,"I ordered this book because it stated in the publishing information that it was the teacher's edition. However, when I received the package, it was just the student edition. I teach 12th grade English and I would like a teacher's edition. Luckily, Amazon quickly resolved the issue. When ordering through a third party, I suggest you contact the seller."
1,Just when I thought I had forgotten about this awful book!,"By the time a student reaches their senior year I'm sure all educators feel it is hard get keep, let alone capture their attention. The folks at HBJ/Holt obviously didn't consider this at all before taking this book to press. This book is better suited for weight-trining as it weighs close to 20 lbs. It is a big, boring, brown (the cover is brown) book. One word sums this book up: yawnfest! Pray for a good teacher who genuinely loves the material this book so poorly presents, that was my one saving grace."
4,Gift Card purchase,The Cathedrals are just the best sounding gospel group. So good I forgot I already had one. It will be played often as I still have a VCR.
3,Good for iPhone 4 - not for Lumia 900!,"While the case itself is nice and offers a lot of protection, it doesn't fit the large Lumia 900. Even if you managed to force the Lumia 900 into the sleeve I don't think you could get it back out again. My old iPhone 4 fits (without the bumper); I think the Lumia 800 may also fit since it's a smaller phone. Three stars for good quality. Disapointed that it was too small for what I really wanted."
3,Burtons Microbiology,"The book is in great condition. The Price was reasonable and affordable, the only thing is that we need to purchase the lab manual separately, you don't have it in a bundle. THanks"
3,Not very interesting but gives you the insite of the Hospitaliy Industry,"This book is not interesting. And I recommend to the authors, to rewrite the book to reflect the 21st century and how the industry has changed."
2,Not a vary interesting text,"I had to buy this book for my college course and I found it wasn't relevant to my prefered job industry. This book is not interesting. And I recommend to the authors, that they rewrite this in terms that make it more iteresting to students."
3,"Nice looking, but...","I thought this was going to be the right thermometer for my weather watching hubbby. Nice looking, traditional styling, but it is not accurate with the temps. We were quite disappointed with this handsome weather gauge."
3,"many things to know about the Speedster, but not only....","The book is filled with pictures, drawings and statistic material. Many pictures of the 356 Speedster. The 911 Speedster doesn't get equal attention.But there's not only information about the Speedster; there's more. This 'more' is in my opinion only of interest for the real Speedster-fan. Pictures of buttons, die-cast modell cars, contemporary cars etcetera take quite some space.For the real Speedster-fans it's probably a 'must have', for others it's 'interesting'."
5,love it,"my garlic powder arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition, I will keep two of thm and give one to our Sons of Italy for the kitchen"
5,Behavior Before Academics,"I was lucky enough to meet Dr. Mendler at various conferences that I hosted and attended regarding alternative education. He has a balanced insight into what is really needed for high-risk, struggling, students. His methods are respectful and effective. I feel sorry for the bureaucrats who still beleive that every child will score 100% proficiency on a standardized test. We need to nurture our children. They come with so many challenges, bad experiences, and hurtful lives. We need to redirect their anger and help them with coping skills and positive social behaviors before we can assist them with their academic needs. This is an excellent book, as well as Dr. Mendler's others. Well worth reading for every teacher, administrator, and educational rebel."
5,A new sound for the new millenium,"Buny's tactful combination of insane metal and hip hop stylings helps them to create an entirely new genre which they have aptly dubbed ""Death Groove."" Buny's sound is not for the weak of heart, it requires a true love for death metal and hardcore bands with excess talent. This cd definitely possesses an original sound matched by none other. Chasing Roadrunner has made it to my list of favorite cds, in company with the likes of KoRn, Slipknot, ICP, System of a Down, and the Deftones. Buny is not only a great new band destined for great things, but the members are also among my closest friends. Their cd is awesome and is a definite ""must-have"" in your hardcore music collection."
4,Not your average rabbit,"I got this cd only hours after hearing a friends copy of it... and I swear every new group that hits the scenes these days is more and more insane! Im a hardcore Slipknot fan but I gotta give it to these guys cuz they a doin something just as crazy. At times it even sounds like there are three percusionist in the band because the drummer goes off so hard. Every time I listen to the cd, especially Different and Cold, 412 and Love Turns I cant help but run aroudn like a mad man. Its no wonder these guys take pride in ""the groove"""

1,"not original, but not bad","this cd is mediocre at the very best. the guitars are all muffled and sound the same most of the way though. drums are good tho. i dont like the way the singer yells. i saw buny live their better live than on this cd thats fer sher. anywayz with all the ""hardcore"" bands coming out theses dayz itz not easy to rise above and be original. their ok but they sound just like all the rest for the most part. 1 star."
2,Robotech Junkie Review,"I love the whole Robotech series. I thought I had the whole story, when I found this chapter on Amazon. I am happy with my purchase, however the story ends lukewarm and reminded me that I never liked how this saga ended. Ready for Toby Mcguire to make a new live action version of this great story. -AJB"
2,Get complete collection,"I paid top dollar for Generation 1 and 3 of Robotech when they first came out on DVD. I'm a big fan and was waiting for years hoping the DVD's would be released. Almost bought the VHS tapes, but held off for these DVD's.Of course, since that time the series has been released at least 2 more times in different formats. There is one complete collection with all 3 generations in one set for $90 or so. That is the one that fans should buy."
3,Decent starter set,"We got this EXACT set at a local furniture store for about $85, so don't buy it at this price (you'll also have to pay shipping). EVERY furniture store has this set. It's a good little set. It's easy to put together, serves it's purpose, and is pretty easy to wipe clean. It does, however stain very easily. Spaghetti sauce, mustard, blueberries, and anything with color will permanently stain it because the wood is so light. My mom brought over a scented candle once and it was on the table for about five minutes an I now have a big red circle there forever. This is good for a starter table, but I wouldn't recommend it for very long-term use."
5,EAST,THESE STRING ARE GREAT. ERNIE BALL ALWAYS PROVIDES GREAT PRODUCTS AT A GREAT PRICE. I PLAY IRISH MUSIC AND THESE HAVE A GREAT SOUND FOR WHAT I PLAY. THEY RETAIN THEIR SOUND FOR A LONG TIME AND I PLAY 2-3 HOURS DAILY.
2,nice original product,A compilation of some typical american cars of the fifties. Those days america was the leader in automobile styling and had the monopoly in the USA. The cars were world famous and sold by the milions in the USA. So surprising that they are so hard to find in the USA of today. Visiting the USA today you'll won't see only cool Detroit cars. Chrome and metal have been replaced bij a whole lot of plastic and economic imported cars rule the streets. A piece of typical American culture has gone. This is a good quality dvd although the host is hard to understand by the way he's speaking.
1,Embarassing,"I have liked some of Lisa Jackson's other books and belief she's a very competent writer - she must have pulled out a really old manuscript for this book - it's embarassingly bad - artificial characters, interactions and emotions that make no sense - I would refer readers to her more recent, mainstream work and avoid this one -"
1,How did this get published?,"I can't even finish this book, I feel like I wasted my money! I can not relate to any of the characters in this book. I feel like Shane is a jerk (to put it nicely), and I can't even sypathize with Mara because she is too pathetic. Lisa Jackson should have given Mara's character some backbone, (like when Shane takes over her office she should have kicked him out for invading her personal space, Instead she just lets him take over.) Anyway, I just wanted to vent because I really do feel like this book is a waste of time and money."
1,false advertising heads this farce,"I can't find a clear enough picture of the cover to properly quote their false advertising. They imply or STATE that the brutality committed against psicosis by super crazy CAN BE SEEN on the cover, yet it is censored on the DVD. That's the only reason I remember buying this DVD, I THINK the Danny Doring match may have been alright, but then again, this is XPW. Somehow XPW had the ability to make Funk vs Shane Douglas look like Chase Tatum vs Van Hammer, for example..."
1,not worth buying,"Cleary seems to have little acquaintance with classical Chinese history and culture. Cleary's language is flaccid, and so full of his own fancy that it's difficult to say what relation his translation has to the Chinese text. Over-produced in so many senses, the form and even content of this translation contradicts the spirit of tao. If you would like to read Chuang Tzu, a much less vaporous translation is Burton Watson's Chuang Tzu, Basic Writings. The language is direct, giving some hint of the concision and grace of classical Chinese, but also retains some of the subtle humor of this profoundly subversive philosopher."
2,painfully bad,"Now, it's true that it's difficult to translate the Tao Te Ching and make the result seem new, but there's no sense in Cleary's distortion of the original text here. Previously clear sentences and phrases become overly ornamented, confusing, and sometimes just plain meaningless compared to the original. Why Cleary insists on putting his unique stamp (self-consiously subtle, didactic, and all around strange) on all his translations I'll never know, but in trying to be original with the Tao Te Ching he _really_ goofed.The Chuang Tzu chapters here aren't much better, either; the Cleary-style shines through. Why would anyone want to own this book, when there are literally a dozen better translations of both works to be found elsewhere?"
4,Great product,"Obviously heavier than the regular slinky but with the same tonally qualities, just alittle deeper. If you are looking for a heavy gauge string than this is worth your time and cash."
3,Wings Hauser Makes This Film Interesting,"This is another 80's VHS nostalgia movie that I had to see on DVD. Scorpion's pimping these horror movies out with class, and I respect them for it. The movie itself is really a ghost story with a few slasher-type kills, but the kills aren't gory. The real draw to the film is Wings Hauser and his connection with the house he's fixing. The job must be done, and nobody's getting in this carpenter's way.That said, it's not the greatest movie. It's boring about sixty percent of the time. The special effects are cheap. This is all for the camp value of Wing Hauser's performance. I'd say if you're a collector, buy it, if you're curious but not a hardcore old school horror fan, rent this before buying.For a slasher, this has a ghost story, a romance sub-plot, and of course, a crash course in home building. Good, but not great. Fun, but not a knee-slapper. This movie gets a big ""It's just okay."""
3,"Just so so, very cheap stuff","I ordered this for our office use. We needed a large whiteboard but we did not have the money for it. So I came up with this idea of buying a tripod and a whiteboard separately to meet the budget. It certainly can hold the whiteboard yet far from being a sturdy support. To look at it, you'd think it shouldn't cost more than $15. Such item finds its use mostly for business, which is probably why it can be priced so high.Though not sturdy. It is extremely light, look very cheap, but it does work."
3,Dark and Depressing,"The only vampire stories I had ever read before was the ""St. Germain"" series by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, and bought this book looking for another ethical ""good"" vampire to love...Stephen Austra is that...and watching his tender relationship with Helen grow is compelling...but this book collapses under the dark malevolent, violently oppressive scenes and themes in the last half. I'm sticking with St. Germain Ragosczy."
3,Interesting Concept,"By Jennifer Bacile, PYN ReviewerThis was an extremely long novel that often seemed to drag, but just as it would almost become unbearably slow, it would take off and gallop away. The characters were interesting, but I found it difficult to remember the time setting as I was reading, particularly with some of the police work. Reading the remainder of the series would probably help me better understand the family dynamics at play in the Austra family. I found the concept of vampirism combined with alien origin to be an interesting combination."
1,Rerecordings... Beware,I love Charley Pride but was disappointed when I played this CD. I was not aware they were not the ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. These songs are ALL RERECORDED and thus lose the original flare they once had.
2,"Great Music, but Not Original...","I grew up listening to Charley Pride and LOVE his music, so when I saw this CD with all his hit songs, I pounced on it immeidately. To my surprise and sadness, all of the songs are remakes ... it's still Charley singing, but they are not the original songs or the sound we are used to. My heart sank. To get this many songs on one CD was a find ... to learn they were remakes killed the moment. So beware.One positive note: I actually like the remake of ""Roll On Mississippi"" much better than the original, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1."
4,Detailed but flawed,"I have read the book in detail, since this was the primary textbook we had for our class. It is quite astounding how so many things have been compiled into a single book -- not only in scope but also in terms of the number of researches put together. But it can be noted that the authors are clearly biased towards ""modern finance"" and defend clearly their own views. Another flaw is that there are ambiguities in some parts. You would not really know what they want to say. With respect to mathematics, the level demanded is alright. In fact, it could probably be made better with more math. Ideas could become clearer that way."
3,Nice stroller but extremely heavy,"I purchased this stroller because I loved the way it looked online. We were expecting our first baby and didn't really know what kind of stroller we wanted and which was the best. This one was quite expensive at almost $500 bucks but hey, you want what is best for the baby.The colors were nice (exactly as shown on the photo), quality of materials was also great - overall it looked really good.It is not all about the looks though. The stroller turned out to be very heavy...too heavy for me to lift and put into my car. ( I am 5 4' ). It also took a lot of space when folded and was not as easy to fold as expected. It fit in the suv with no problems but did not fit into our 07 Audi A4. That's something you should consider if you don't have an suv. I returned it."
5,Surprised,"It seems like many people either love or hate this release, due to the styalistic diversion from past RIB releases. I personally love how the band has mixed all their styles into one release, by that I refer to the style of Transmutator, dj RIB and DJ skOOby. They didn't limit themselves to any particular genre and as a result developed a beutiful hybrid. When I first got the CD when in Boston i didn't stop listening to it for a month, every time I listen to it I find little bits that i didn't remember from before, it's like a new CD everytime. This release is a great deal, it come with two discs, one of original releases, the second filled with remixes and two videos. All this for a price less than most regular CD's. If you want to listen to track samples check out www.razedinblack.net ."
5,"Solid, Sultry and Darkly Erotic","I've been listening to industrial/goth music for over 10 years now, and I'd have to say that this album has been one of the most influential in my vast collection. It made me look at myself, my life in retrospect; it made me evaluate who and what I am. Very grateful for that. Yes, this album is pretty much flawless, especially with ""There Goes my Head"" and ""Come Back to Me."" I believe Rommell Regulacion is one of our greater deejays of the times-he has a way of bringing you into his own S&M; hell-which I will visit daily, thank you! *laughs*Regarding his past albums, Regulacion extends RIB into a newer, trancier version of its former self. But don't let that fool you into thinking this is merely just another EBM record. It's not-it's empowering, erotic and exciting to listen to, so save a piece of your soul today and get this album! I command, go....now..."
1,"Adverstised, But Not In Stock",I really wanted these when I saw them. Palm trees are a large part of my motif. I ordered them only to find out later that they were out of stock. That really ticked me off.
1,not as advertised. This is not the 3 pack of keyboards,This is not the OEM 3 pack of keyboards/mice. This is a single keyboard/mouse combo from the 3 pack produced by Microsoft. Get the retail version for a whole lot less money. This is a complete misrepresentation of the product. The Microsoft part number listed on the site is the same as from Microsoft for the three keyboards/mice.
5,Great vanilla bean,"I used up some vanilla beans that I've had for over a year to make vanilla extract. I bought these to make things that call for fresh vanilla beans (gelato). Soft and fresh, they are easy to work with and of course taste great."
1,low quality,ordered 12 of the madagascar beans most of them where rancid upon arrival seem to be fermented very low quality
1,Boring Pseudo-Profound Stoner Material,"GOATS is the worst book, by far, I've read in the past two years, and I review books for national publications all the time so I've read quite a few books. Perhaps next time out, Poirier should write a book as promising as his debut collection of stories, because this novel reads as if hatched, stillborn, from a cupboard--the characters have no depth, the writing is flat and boring, and the worldview pretentious. Who wants to read more pseudo post-Kerouac prophesizing, anyway?"
3,"goats, bongs and not much else","In order for a novel to hold my interest, the protagonist has to have some sort of major conflict, regardless of what form it takes. Secondly, he has to have at least one noticeable flaw, in other words he has to come off as human. Ellis Whitman is undeniably cool but utterly forgettable once you close ""Goats"" because he lacks both of these. The reader learns a great deal about what CDs he listens to, what kind of pot he prefers, etc., but not much else. From start to finish, he makes decisions which are mature for the average teenager. Throughout the book, almost everything goes his way, down to his Latin grade being raised from an A minus to an A. This was so foreign from my adolescence that I just couldn't care. The goats were the only thing in the book with any life."
2,how Ellis became a bore,"The novel started out strong. I immediatley became immersed in the life of Ellis, Wendy, Goat man and Barney. I wanted so much for Ellis just to keep his cool composure and not sell out to the stuffy persona that his prep school embodied. I did want him to become more responsible than his parents, but I feel like he never really got to have a child hood and then he started becoming a jerk and I was never really sure why. I thought that the novel ended abruptly and didn't give proper explanation of certain details. Like Why was Wendy so crazy? Why did Frank really leave? Did she always love him? Why did Ellis start acting like a spoiled brat? Was Goat man really doing anything with the goats?@! It might have been more of a coming of age novel for Wendy than it really was for Ellis"
3,breaks easily,"While this collar worked great for the two weeks I had it, it didn't take my dog long to figure a way out of it while walking and for him to eventually wear it down to where it broke."
5,A Landmark Folklore Study,"Dr. Blaustein's book is destined to become a standard reference for teachers and students of History, English, American and Ethnic Studies. The author simplifies the complex connections between Appalachian and Scotish traditions. He concludes that despite the pressures from dominant cultures, traditions are as tough as thistles and briers to destroy. Dr. Blaustein applies folklore and oral history techniques to prove that cultural revitalization movements have helped empower people who are oppressed by outside colonial forces. This book is a strong reminder of the power of poetry and music to reinforce and regenerate ethnic identity."
1,never received the product,first of all I am john george. I had a disappointing experience with Amazon. Never received any of the movie guides I ordered. I would not use amazon again. The sellers either did not have the product or there was miscommunication. There is no person to speak with. One does not know who is billing or not. I find this web site frightening.
1,He may not have watched them,"One of the worst movies ever made was Laserblast. But, in Maltin's eyes, it deserves 2 and a half stars. Why don't you rent this movie and see what kind of taste this man has."
4,Great for a rainy day!,"If you have kids, this is for you. Something like this is really for the younger generation but don't get me wrong adults can still have fun with it too. Even if you don't know the songs, it's still great fun. My wife & I actually took over the micraphone from the kids and had a blast. It's hard not to put it away until you go through the entire album (that's disc for the younger generation). Overall a good buy!"
3,Acid Mothers Temple - 'Mantra Of Love' (Alien8),"'Mantra Of Love' is apparently the last Acid Mothers disc to feature synth/vocalist Cotton Casino.Just two cuts here.""La Le Lo"" runs for 30 minutes and brings us even more of that lengthy droning noisy space rock,that many of us have come to love.""L'Ambition dans le Miroir""(15:02)is more or less another piece of chaotic sonic mayhem,where I seem to hear Tibetan bells,groovin' snyth work and mind-scrambling guitar licks being put to full use.Sounds really good while wearing headphones."
5,A book that will be understood in the next years,"Vittorio Guidano is an italian psychiatrist who has made a big step in the attempt to explain human experience based on the latest theories in areas such as complexity theory, evolutionary epistemology,constructivism in psychology, primatology,phylosophy of science, and the list goes on and on. With an amazin integrational capacity he has also developed a psychotherapy who is coherent with the theory he defend. I think that the complexity of his approach will be understood in the futures years, because psychology and psychotherapy still has a simplistic descriptive approach to human experience rather than an explicative complex theory of the process of the self and his evolutionary being."
1,Buyer Beware,"Please be careful. Alzheimer Disease is a devistating disease and it is not fair to offer families false hope. There are so many things we have learned over the years to help make this disease easier to understand, however, to steer individuals this way is wrong."
3,"INFORMATION,CONSIDERATON, AND EDUCATON","THIS BOOK PRESENTS RESEARCH AND POSSIBLE INTERVENTONS IN EASY TO UNDERSTAND LANGUAUGE. I FOUND IT TO BE INTERESTING READING, BEACUSE I AM A CAREGIVER TO MY MOTHER WHO HAS THIS DISEASE. THIS BOOK IS NOT THE DEFINITIVE ANSWER TO THE DISEASE, BUT IT DOES CONTAIN ""INTERESTING"" INFORMATION TO CONSIDER FOR MYSELF AS WELL AS MY MOTHER. AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO CURE, AND ONLY THROUGH RESEARCH WILL THERE BE ONE."
1,Very poor image quality,"I love this series, and I own it on Laser Disc. I bought the DVD's thinking that the picture would be even better. Wrong wrong wrong!!! They have cramed so many episodes onto these discs that they are a mass of artifacts and very dull pictures. These are the only DVD's that I have ever had to return for reasons of very poor quality. Stay away."
4,Too Cool,"This is an amazing series. First, the episodes are less than 30 minutes, but a lot is squeezed in that amount of time. Second, the camera shots are awesome. Great staging and all of it is shot in glorious black and white. Third, the music is great. Where else do you get jazz in these large doses as Pete hang out at Mother's and other clubs around the unnamed city? Last, is the quality of the scripts. Gunn is cool and his girl Edie Hart, very hot. They are fun to watch together--grown up double entendres fly about, but it is a chaste relationship, sort of. Edie is frequently left waiting while Pete is out working for a client.It all worksGood TV for grown ups that entertains in and of its own right and viewed through the prism of one-century, demonstrates how lame most TV is today."
5,Must Have for Classic TV Lovers,"I've had this dvd for a while now, and watch it often. The writing is superb, Craig Stevens and the rest of the cast are great, and the music!!! Henry Mancini's Peter Gunn album was the first album to win a Grammy (in 1959). In response to reviewers who have complained about the picture quality, all I can say is that it is very good. Of course it's not bluray ""quality"" (thank goodness for that!), this A&E version is very watchable. If you like noir and appreciate the art of making black and white film, you'll love this dvd."
1,A GREAT Series with POOR quality transfers!,"Shame on A&E for using the syndicated masters on the series. In many cases hissy, 16mm prints with scratches in them. To make matters worse, the episodes are cut 22 minute syndicated versions. Another BIG disappointment. The packaging should have been the tip off here...COLOR pictures do exist from the series BUT so-so black and white shots used for the covers. This series deserves better!"
3,"5 Stars for the show, O for DVD quality",It's great to see these old shows again. Classic suave and sexy atmospheric noir. But shame on A&E for the terrible DVD transfer. Scratchy soundtrack and the grainy and flawed print detract from the enjoyment. A&E did the same with many of their other Cult TV releases. It shows a lack of respect for the customer.
5,LOVE IT!!,"This is a top-notch old time gumshoe detective show. It's one of the best late night curl up with a blanket in the dark and watch a film-noir type show. As for the quality of transfer - I consider myself lucky that these shows have even been saved in a way that allows for reproduction in the first place. Being much younger than these shows-I'm actually thrilled with the quality-I found no problems that affected the viewing. I'd rather they looked the gritty way they did way back when than look like a show made in B/W today. It's authentic, and it's a really great show."
4,Great True Stories of Crime,"If you like to read true crime stories or want to dig into the minds of criminals you'll get a kick out of this book.The book describes the lives and criminal acts of inmates a penitentiary from crime families to sex offenders to master manipulators.I like the criminals who tried to escape in a sewer and smelled pretty foul afterwards (Lots of other scatalogical crimes are featured as well- if you like such things).I also thought the compassion shown, not to the criminal acts, but to the lives of those who know no other way of life taught me something. This book is both an entertaining book for fun and also an interesting peak at the REAL lives and minds of criminals.This book is written by a criminologist/psychologist with a lot of compassion, experience, and street smarts!If Justin Ciale were a famous man, this book (with a little editing and marketing) would be a best-seller in my opinion."
1,Boring film from Vicente Fernandez,A Thoroughly boring film dealing with gamblers and their love and competition for a woman.not one of Vicente Fernandez best films.
3,A must see for fans of the ex-Miss Universe,"Two childhood friends fight for the love of the same woman ,and who measures each man , against each other. A former Miss Universe from Spain in 1974, Amparo is beautiful,vulnerable and fatal.A tragic mexican movie!!!"
1,Wrong movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Also ordered this mmovie and received the wrong dvd! I was really looking foward to the 80's backkwoods dvd I thought I was buying! Oh well.
4,divorce organizer,This book has served as a practical guide to start to approach the myriad of things to consider. I recommend it as a resource for those overwhelmed by this event.
4,Organizer Planner Book,This is a great book for anyone unfamiliar with the divorce process. It has been very helpful to me and I am not yet finished with reading the book. I am sure that I will refer back to many useful tips many times as I proceed through the process of divorce.
1,outdated,This book was so outdated it was useless. It included instructions for women on how to dress for your court date! I returned it for a refund.
2,When a Guy gets divorced,"This book is written from the perspective of a woman. Why is it that everyone things the woman always gets screwed? When I was told , ""I don't want to live with you anymore"" and ""I want everything you have and will have"" I was looking at the end, 29 years of marriage, 9 months from retirement. Well let me tell you, I have been told the game is to squeeze the guy hard to get everything but not hard enough to make him quite. I am looking at all the debt, she is looking for all the assests and I will be paying her $40k/year maintenace until I am 76. Where is a book for a guy to screw his exwife?"
5,a must-read,Carl Zimmer is one of the finest science writers of our generation. This is an amazing peek into the origins of modern science. It helps us see the shape of the lens through which we view reality today. It's also an astonishing story.
4,The search for consciousness,"Ths book is an excellent historical background to man's attempts to understand his own mind. It's also a great primer for some of the theories man has held about his own anatomy andconsciousness.The author keeps it interesting by tracking the story to the lives Thomas Willis and his buddies at Oxford who must skillfully skate through a minefield of intellectual dogma and even civil war to lay the foundations for scientific mehtod.The author does a fine job of turning history into a story and ends up teaching the reader quite a bit.As a bonus the author gives us a short but thoughtful conclusion. Showing how modern researchers continue the quest for the answer to the question what is ""man""."
1,OH MY GOD WHAT THE HECK WAS THIS KIND OF THING??,"OH DEAR MY FRIEND GAVE THIS TO ME FOR MY BIRTHDAY CAUSE HE SAW HIM LONG TIME AGO IN PLEASANTON OR SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT OH MY GOD IT IS LIKE THE FINGERS GOING DOWN THE BLACKBOARD ECHOING AND MAKING MY SPINE GO CRAZY! NIGHTMARE! NOW, I USE THIS CD AS COASTER. DO NOT DARE BUY! NOT GOOD."
1,Soul Stirring? Let's take another listen shall we?...,"As a fan and patron of the San Francisco music seen for many years, here is but another Johnny-come-lately trying to pelt us with another home-grown CD. Musicians do roll in and out of the Bay Area like the fog, but like those low-lying lingering clouds, it's difficult to make anything out -- including anything unique about ""Mo"" and his new album Sweet Time. The guitar playing lacks the groove and melody needed to make an acoustic album like this work. The vocals are a confusing mix between a Geddy Lee and the Indigo Girls and shows little range and depth. All in all, if you like this kind music it's an okay album, otherwise save your money for the holidays."
4,Sweet tunes,"I'm always surprised at the range of people's impressions to music. I saw Derek Mo play in Oakland a long time ago. He put on a good show and I bought the CD which is one of my local music favorites. The recording quality could be better, but the music is good."
4,Good Stuff,"I sure liked it a lot more than the last review. There were some pretty catchy songs, though it is clearly an indy record. Good stuff, wouldn't mind hearing some new material."
5,A Must Have,"This is a very good dvd to just hook up to a sound system and just groove. I really loved the remakes of Stevie Wonder that Glenn Lewis performed. If you like Maxwell's Mtv Unplugged, then you'll love this one."
3,This is an intro to web programming languages,"I thought this book touched on the basics (syntax, methods, variables) of web programming but does not go into too much detail of anything else (array splitting, shopping cart, etc). It is for complete novices."
3,dont waste your money!!! and update,"now i have so many watches..., you can say im a watch collector and youre right, prices from this timex up to 7000 usd , this is no doubt about it a wsaste of time, money and patience...the time and day was not set on the fabric right, so you CAN NEVER DREAM OF GETTING IT FIXED, PLEASE , PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS, WAIT A LIT TLE LONGER AND BUY A CITIZEN ECO DRIVE PERPETUAL, NICE, GREAT LOOKING AND YOU WILL NEVER BE FOOLED WITH A BAD, POOR CUALITY PRODUCT.update. 1 march 2010well having in mind that this watch was not sent to me working as it should be, i sent it to a local lewerly for repair and they did his job right, now its working properly , the indiglo is one of the most usefull invents , and this looks even costlier than the actual price...they've lost easily 4 stars for not sending the product well inspected before leaving fabric."
4,A good beginning underwater camera!,"I just purchased this camera and have already used it on 6 dives and found it to work so much better than other disposable cameras and housing for scuba diving. It's not a Nikonos (sp?) but it's still pretty good for a beginner. The only thing I don't like too much is that if you're pretty close to one object but also too far away from another object in the same frame, the flash is only good for within some many feet. Anything further and you can start to see the bluish cast from taking underwater photos around the perimeter of the photo. I also purchased the 3X macro lens to go with it, but found that I had much difficulty keeping this portable lens on without actually using both hands at the same time trying to keep it on the camera while taking a photo. Otherwise a great camera!"
3,A good beginning camera,"I bought this camera for photographing my SCUBA dives. My first experience was that the case leaked and ruined the film on my first dive. There was a flaw in in the o-ring gasket, which the manufacturer remedied by replacing the camera. The second model works well, is easy to handle, has good viewfinder size, and clips easily on my B-C. However, I find that the camera has problems with film advancing, too. The flash color compensation is not the best and could stand some more strength. The pictures I've taken in relatively shallow water come out with a boring color sameness. I would like more contrast. However, for a beginner, this would be the right camera until you get to wanting better underwater exposures."
2,Better than disposables,"Don't expect quality like a Nikonos, as this is not a professional camera. After a few rolls, mine has trouble pulling the film completely to the next frame, resulting in overlapping exposures early in the roll, even in a 24 exposure roll. Sharpness and focus is pretty good, but its difficult to center the subject, especially when using the optional close-up attachment, since there is no parallex correction in the rangefinder (You'll need to point the camera ""down"" farther as you shoot closer to center the subject. I also have the external flash, which works well and improves the image quality considerably on close-ups. Final: good starter camera, but if you have the bucks get a Nikonos or rent one for the day."
4,I just recommended this camera....,....over the Canon Elph. It works at a greater depth. This makes it more versatile at only a slightly higher cost.
2,Requires cutting,"This filter serves it's purpose, but you have to cut it to fit your specific air filter. This is a generic carbon pre-filter and not specific to any one model. Cutting it is quite messy, and it is difficult to cut in a straight line."
5,Most amazing Metamorphosen I've ever listened!,"I've listened to most of famous recordings of Metamorphosen including Karajan (His studio recordings & 70/80s'live), Klemperer, Levine, and Furtwangler's deeply moving reading, and thought it was impossible to beat these masters.Recently, I bought this CD secondhand for rediculous price to sell to someone else, and when I played the cd just for testing, I immediately changed my mind. I was amazed by the richness of tones, and felt as if I was transported into a different world. In Jarvi's reading, every part is vividly articulated and full of warmth and emotion. Every intrument sings its heart out and joins in the cosmic dace of dreams and destruction. Only weakness is the climax after a moment of silence, which is not as powerful as Karajan's digital version. Yet, overall it is so deeply moving and rich experience that 26 minutes playing time feels unbelievable. The recorded sound has plenty of presence."
4,"Fun, Fun and Fun!","Carmen Miranda was the queen of what she did, and that was singing the latin rhythms. Listening to these CD's, I am surprised how many of the songs are familiar, from both movies and those songs stolen for Bugs Bunny to make fun of Carmen. The tunes are infectious - they make you want to grab a fruit hat and dance along. This is one of life's guilty pleasures - just putting on a collection of music like this and just let yourself go. Great music to just chill out with. The only complaint is the lack of liner notes really does not do justice to help describe Ms. Miranda's role in the music world in her day. Otherwise - great!"
2,"long, boring, too many reps, done too quickly to be effective","I love the Firm, but I was very disappointed with this set. The standing legs consists of many fast paced, repetitive, light weight lunges. The weight is too light and the speed is too quick, compromising form, and reducing it's effectiveness. The upper body video, once again, has too many reps, with too little weight to warrant an effective upper body workout. At the end of each workout my heart rate remained low, my muscles were not pumped, and I had a hard time telling whether my muscles or my joints were fatigued from the excessive reps. Since I couldn't really concentrate and tighten my muscles because of the fast pace, I think my joints got the workout instead."
1,Absolutely Hate it!!,"I bought this DVD and was sorely disappointed. I was not expecting it to be a copilation of 80's workouts. Maybe someone else can, but I can't stand looking at people wearing leg warmers, leotards, big hair and tons of make-up! Even the warm up is cheesy.Buy the Body Sculpting System I and II, those will give you results, don't waste your money on this."
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"NO WONDER I GOT THIS DVD FOR ONLY $1.89! ITS NOT EVEN WORTH THAT! I BOUGHT THIS DVD THINKING I WOULD HAVE ''THE PLEASURE'' OF SEEING THE LOVELY SALINA BARTUNEK [AKA. AMERICAN GLADIATOR 'ELEKTRA']IN HER OWN EXERCISE VIDEO. MERCHANDISE OF HER IS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN, CANT EVEN FIND AN 8X10 PHOTO ONLINE.'SHEESH'! ANYWAY, THINKING I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO OWN SOMETHING WITH THE GIRL I HAD A CRUSH ON BACK IN 1992, I ORDERED THIS DVD. SALINA IS ONLY USED AS ''A FIGUREHEAD '' TO GET YOU TO BUY THE DAMN VIDEO! SHE 'HOSTED' THE VIDEO, NOT HER OWN WORKOUT. THIS IS BEYOND RIDICULOUS. OTHER PEOPLE DID THE WORKOUTS AND COMPRISED THE BULK OF THE DVD. I AM 'BEYOND' DISAPPOINTED! IF YOU ARE A FAN OF 'ELEKTRA' AND THINK THIS WILL BE A NICE COLLECTIBLE TO REMEMBER HER BY, 'DO NOT' I REPEAT ''DO NOT''! BUY THID DVD. EVEN FOR A DOLLAR, ITS NOT WORTH THE DISC ITS PRINTED ON, NUFF SAID!!!The Firm: Firm Parts - Upper Body/Standing Legs"
5,A Firm Believer,"I love having these two workouts on the same tape. I can choose to do upper body, lower body or both for a full body workout."
3,Totally 80's,"The cover is very deceptive. This DVD is so dated, very Jane Fonda. This was my first firm DVD. I've not purchased any in the past because they typically require some type of special firm apparatus however I read so many great reviews I decided to give this a try since it mainly required weights according to the cover.They've taken clips of upper body segments from various videos with different instructors and spliced them together with a different person introducing each segment.There is an instructional section that I found somewhat informative, and it was a decent workout, but not something I would recommend spending money on unless you're partial to leotards and leg warmers."
5,Excellent Piece worth every cent !,I bought this product after a long research.This is worth the price u pay.Steiner makes the finest binoculors in the world and put their very soul in it.8x magnification is more than enough for casual users.I have tried other binoculors but those are bit bulky and you don't get the calrity as the zoom power increases.With 8x u can view a lots of good stuff.I am happy to own this Product.You also get good quality stuff form Zeiss too ! You can compare and buy based on ur needs.It was cheaper in sunsetcamera.com
3,Good moves to begin including exercise in your life BUT ...,"if you get aggravated by participants talking back and forth about how good they feel and hollering out 'Yeah!', etc. while they exercise, this one'll drive you crazy."
4,Great Workout!!,"I have tried several work out videos and I LOVE, LOVE this one!! It is so great and ""easy"" to get through. I can really tell the difference in my thighs and my stomache after working out to these videos. I always do the 2 mile. I have just bought the 3 mile and it's definitely a lot tougher."
4,Great for people with limited physical ability.,"I have Fibromyalgia, and was looking for a low-impact exercise programme to follow that wouldn't require days to recover from. I've not really followed the 2-mile programme, but the 1-mile is short and relatively easy. There's not a ton of bouncing, unless you want to, and you can get as intense as you want. Also, those participating in the video demonstrate three different levels throughout, so you can follow which ever one is more comfortable. The set is also a great value, as you have two programmes for the cost of one."
4,"Great, especially for beginners","My sister recently bought these in an attempt to walk away some pounds and get in shape. To keep her company (and cause I was curious) I also tried these. The moves are very simple. Leslie talks a lot and keeps you on track. As a pretty advanced exerciser I didn't feel very challenged, especially with the Get Up and Get Started one, but my sister enjoyed them a lot. I would reccomend these to all those who want to lose some pounds but just don't have the time/energy/will to go do it outside. Good Luck!"
3,Fun & great for limited time,"These are good workouts when you have limited time & or it's snowing or too hot outside or what have you. My main complaint about most exercise videos is the music & the kind of high pitched perkiness of the instructors. Leslie is clearly nice, though, & the work out is effective even though you get sort of tired of hearing about the balls."
5,Great for Starters,"I received this dvd at the end of January but did not use it until recently, it is the perfect workout for those who are starting to get fit. I have only used the first workout and its' tempo is simple yet challenging. The exercises were very easy to grasp and follow. Once the weights were added, the burn could be felt even more. It was only eighteen minutes; therefore, by the time you are feeling it and thinking about quitting (LOL), it's almost finished. Great for those trying to get back into the swing of things."
5,No need to walk outdoors on rainy days,I found I get a good mile workout with this dvd no matter what kind of weather.
4,Easy workout for a girl on the go,"I love this DVD because it allows me get a satisfying workout without hitting the gym or braving bad weather. The ""Get Up and Get Started"" video is a great quick workout, and the ""High Calorie Burn"" builds on the techniques used in the one-mile walk. This workout involves easy-to-learn movements that just about anyone can master, and allow the flexibility of walking with or without using hand weights. Leslie's style is friendly and motivating without being overbearing, and her cues are easy to follow."
4,Good at home Short Workout,"The 2 mile walk is good for a quick (35 min.) workout at home, but I wish she did more arm work and more with the weights. She doesn't use the weights until very close to the end. In her 3 mile walk, she starts uses the weights around the 1/2 way mark. It's a much better workout if you have the time (about 50 min.)."
5,Leslie Sansone Review,"This product was great! I like that fact it has both 1 mile and 2 miles on it. If I dont feel like working out for 30 min for the 2mile I can just do 19 min on with the 1 mile tape. The two mile portion really has me sweating and it is a great work out. I dont have the weighted balls she uses on the tape, I just use free weights."
5,Nice & Easy,"This is the perfect starting point for anyone interested in getting in shape. I didn't even use weights for the workout and still felt it. The is a nice, easy pace, and Leslie is easy to understand. Nothing difficult in this workout at all. I recommend it for everyone (even my 8-year old son loved doing the workout)."
5,Walk Away Pounds,I have used a number of different videos and DVDs from Leslie Sansone and this is my favorite. It is easy enough for an older person or one not in great shape. Great to use as a starter for getting yourself into better shape.
5,Great Progressive workouts,"For beginners starting out who want to increase their fitness level without injuries, these workouts are perfect! Start with the 1 mile workout, and work up to the 2 mile workout's faster pace. Leslie Sansone also has 3 and 4 mile workouts that continue the progressive increase in fitness. The workouts are low impact and you don't need a lot of room. The movements are easy -- no complicated dance movements or high impact jumping. The one part I didn't like is the music is boring elevator type music, and Leslie does talk a lot. Not as much (or as cutesie annoying as Denise Austin), but she does get a bit perky. :) I used to play a CD of other music while I did the workout to make it more my style."
3,Amazon Instant Video,Bought the Amazon Instant Video to use on my laptop. Liked the workout but disappointed because it only includes the first workout. Has anyone else had this problem? I was under the assumption that I would have access to both of the workouts instead of just the first workout.Half the workouts for double the price makes me wish that I could return it.Workout- 4 starsVideo content- 2 stars since half of the DVD is missing.Disappointed.
1,Don't bother,"I bought this phone as a Christmas present for a friend. We now refer to it as the ""possessed"" phone. It clicks and makes strange noises, even when fully charged. You get what you pay for."
4,Dorm Room Phone Review,"I bought this phone a few weeks ago for use in our dorm room. It is a good, basic phone, and...if it gets damaged in the course of college life, it dosen't matter. It does have some static and noise out on our deck, but other than that it is a reliable phone and my roomate and I are very happy with it. It is comfortable to hold and very light, with clear buttons and good instructions, plus the rebate. If you are in the market for a phone, you'll be happy with this one."
2,Bad Sound when Talking,"The price is right, but when I talk into this phone it doesn't sound natural. The voice of the person that I am talking to is good, but my voice sounds wierd. Maybe all cordless phones are this way. I don't know."
3,Great for Beginners and Immediate Fitness Enthusiastic!,"Besides the consistent advertising of the BeachBody webiste and products which is very ANNOYING, this dvd is a great alternative for me when I need to get active or burn calories and don't feel like doing an intense workout. The bands for the strength training and exercises that she has are very good and definitely challenging. I believe there are only 4 or 5 cds though...not all that's featured on the pic and I have the complete Program. I was lucky and got mine for $25 on beachbody for a BlackFriday sale. So definitely a plus for me, I honestly am glad I didn't pay the price that is feature here...I would have been mad."
4,worms!! yuck! or are they?,"The Worm Family is very ""wormy"". They are long, and squirmy. They like to sing loud. They are very different from there bug neighbors. They neighbor are mean to them and the Worm family decides to move somewhere where they will not be judged by others. They try several places but always run into others who don't like them because they are different. Finally they find a worm family just like them and all goes well from then on out!There are lots of themes that can be discussed with this book such as family, self esteem, and worms.We would recommend this book for families to read and discuss together. This is a great story to illustrate that just because some one is not just like you that doesn't mean that they don't have feelings that can get hurt."
2,Could've been A LOT better...,"The Olympus iZoom 2000 looks great- sleek, small, light and silver. Judging by the price I thought this would be a good camera, and small enough to take anywhere. Unfortunately I found out the hard way that this camera is by no means perfect. Every picture I have taken with this camera came out grainy and low quality, much worse than my cheaper Minolta Freedom camera I had before. Also, the viewfinder is tiny when you look through it so you can hardly see what you're taking a picture of... I asked a few other people about this, so it's not just me. It's also confusing to control the flash, etc. This camera is NOT WORTH IT, go for a higher quality Olympus or a Canon Elph if you want a compact camera that takes quality pictures. Dont waste your money on this one!"
2,"Great Looking, Less Filling :-(",I luv the looks & compactness. But the pixs were grainy and very dissapointing.I shot pixs on a clear & bright day on the beach and it looked like it was unfocused.OVerall build quality is good. Easy instruction and ease of APS. But I expected more picture quality. It makes me long for 35mm.The 2 stars are for looks only!
4,GB Leighton - This Life,We saw GB Leighton at the House of Blues in Chicago and knew immediately that they were something a little different. They only had three of their members on stage and they still shone. Buying the CD just for the song All I Want Is You is worth it.
3,Great Kit and gift,"on time and as described.. living in hurricane country , i purchased one for all of my familys cars.. its compact but the case is very sturdy.. planning on purchasing one for my nephew once he purchases a car."
2,Good item,Good price but now the connectors are loose and I just moved it from one machine to another. I guess you get what you paid for.
3,"So, So","Could not use it, and it is laying around somewhere, maybe later I will find a use for this as this is somewhat outdated, a thing of the past now."
3,Not bad.,"These component cables have good video quality... but there are a few little things that I don't like. First, the 5 cables are attached together in a row, which makes a bulky cable for fishing through walls. Second, there's a red video cable and a red audio connector, which is somewhat confusing when you're behind your tv plugging in cables.I prefer the ""MediaBridge Ultra Series"" component cables. They're slightly more expensive but solve both above issues.[...]"
4,"Good cable, ends are a little loose, had to seperate cables","This is a pretty good cable. The connectors on the ends are a little on the loose side, not really a big deal though; it has no effect on the cable performance. I had to connect this to a DishDVR to give signal to a second TV, receiver is in a entertainment shelf and I had to seperate the cables so they would bend enough to keep from pulling out of the receiver(the hole that the cables came into the shelf was up higher than receiver and it pulled up on cable and made it pull out). Seperation gave a little more flexibility, doesn't pull out anymore, and it didn't effect the performance. It is thick, but until HDMI splitters get cheaper it will work. Works great, good buy."
4,A Useful replacement for a lost nut - not an exact match,"This was shown as a good match for my 1995 Nissan Pickup. It does fit OK and uses the same wrench (13/16"")so that is all good. But it is 1.4"" long and all the other nuts as fitted by the manufacturer are about 1"" long. Gorilla doesn't appear to manufacture one that is an exact match."
3,Check your lug wrench size,"I did not think to check first. These take a 13/16"" (~20.5mm) wrench. My stock nuts use a 19mm (3/4"") lug wrench."
2,Think tanks bungle yet another topic,"The role of values in public policy is certainly a topic worthy of discussion. Unfortunately, this book does not do a fine job of discussing the matter. It presents the typical think tank view of the world - rigidly ideological defenses of policy backed by a boatload of numbers. Values don't work well when forced into the defense of a viewpoint, and work even less when they are being quantified. The ideas of many of the writers, such as James Q. Wilson's notion of an underclass mentality, had been discredited even before they appeared in this work. For a serious discussion of the role of values in public policy, read a book by Rev. Jim Wallis or a like-minded soul, not by a bunch of think-tank technocrats."
4,A fun ride with Jay Leno,Anyone who likes classic cars will enjoy this romp through Leno`s car collection. You will see some very rare items and a few that are one of a kind. The steam cars are a real treat to see. Working ones are few and far between these days.
3,Nice,"This was a sweet book that described the characters and place well. It is a simple read, but was enjoyable."
2,Did not hold my interest.,"This book about a girl and and a buy meeting in the open spaces of Montana where she was taking care of him - did not keep my interest. Thank goodness, I did not pay money for the book."
5,The Girl from Montana is an excellent story.,This book is well written and holds your interest making you wonder what will happen next. Will read other books by this author.
5,The girl from montana,This book is very well written. It is a really great story that you just can't put down. I highly recommend that you read it.
4,The girl from Momtana,I enjoyed reading this book and had a hard time putting it down. It has a good story line that really keeps your intrest. Enjoy books with a good story that you feel like you can really get envolved in.
5,great reading and service,Thank you for the prompt service and good material connected with this sale. It was a rewarding book to read. I wish books had rating like movies do. Sometimes you get into a 'seemingly good clean book' and toss it for bad content. Thank you
5,One of the Best I Have Seen on the Market,"""Wolf, although an ardent trout fisherman, includes in this book information for the ever-growing number of anglers that have taken to fishing for cool and warm-water species using buggy-whip techniques. And it doesn't end there. It is a great reference to the special waters of Pennsylvania even for bait and spinning tackle anglers...."
4,Flyfishers Guide to Pennsylvania,Very useful book on the geography and how to get there as well as where to fish and what to use. What is lacking is a detailed listing of the fly shops in the area. I located one on Kettle Creek and one near Pine Creek and found them to be very helpful on real time basis ie what the fish were hitting on that morning etc.
5,Excellent Training for Legs,"If you want an awesome workout for your glutes, hamstrings, and quads...buy this. Granted, you'll recognize all the instructors from Tough Tape 2. All they did w/ this DVD (I thought it was new, not old routines from the above) was take the lower body sculpting from Tough Tape 2 and put it in this one. And there were segments that were not in Tough Tape 2, which made this workout longer. To sum it up, throw away your old Firm video and buy this one. The Upper Body Split is also not ""new"", it is from the old tape. Only keep the old video if you like total body training in one sitting. This one is like 70 minutes long and it's ALL LEGS. Highly recommend it!"
4,Supersets Galore,"If you like dips and lunges this workout is for you.It is a compilation of the old FIRM workouts (The Hare, StrongBody, StrongHeart, Better Body & Buns, Maximum Body Shaping, Cardio Burn, and Maximum Cardio.It is 69 minutes long. It contains four supersets (on each leg) of lunges and dips. It also contains several set of leg presses using the tall box on each leg.I think the best part of the workout was the floor work.The flow of the workout was very good. I felt that there was thought put in the way this workout was put together.I had DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) two days after doing this workout."
2,Not as good as the young Ray,I was dispointed in this remake..First of all I didn't know this was old Ray.I guess because I grew up with Rays songs in my head..Some things just don't need to change..
4,"Works well, don't care for the ball-lock","This carabiner works great and is decently strong, I just don't like the ball-lock mechanism. I figured I would give it a shot, but I prefer the screw gates. If you're interested, then I'd suggest giving it a shot because it works pretty well, and the locking mechanism is more personal preference than anything."
4,"Some Timeless, Some Outdated","Many of the articles (columnist for New York Times) in this book are outdated -- many of the wines are no longer good, the prices have tripled, many of the restaurants are no longer around, etc. However, many of the articles are timeless. They give the same advice that the current experts are giving, but in a more easily read presentation. For that, I would give it five stars, but the outdated articles pull it down to four stars. Worth checking out, especially for avid readers of wine material."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"I purchased my Charisma in Feb. 2004 My Machine Died on March of 2006, 1 month after my warranty expired.(I had recieved an additional years warranty when I purchased the machine) The cost of the repairs came to $225.00. I Sold the machine. I felt that a machine that cost $700.00 should last alot longer than 2 years. The technician that repaired the machine said that Charisma has had alot of problems due to a leaky valve that shorts out the circut board. If you have a repair center near you I would recommend a regular tune up. This costs about $30.00.Yes I loved my machine until it died, however a 1 year warranty is not enough when you consider how much it cost to begin with and how much it will cost to repair. Don't you think if Saeco really believed they make a great product that they would stand behind it with a great warranty. Even Bunn gives a 3 year warranty."
3,Good Machine but mine has a design flaw,"I have owned this item for 3 years. it performs well, but has been back in the shop 3 times. There is a design flaw in the steamer valve, that needs to be replaced when it starts leaking. If you leave it too long it will short out the front panel circuit board. Keep it clean using a descaler, every month or so, and use distilled water(cuts down on calcium)Other than that it makes great coffee."
4,about the beans,"I am in love with our cafe charisma which we received as an amazing gift. I think the coffee is great. We do have the leaking steam valve, though, which I see we need to get fixed to avoid the short in the panel. I just wanted to tell you if it's full of beans but the light says it doesn't have beans, you just have to stir them around a little. Sometimes they don't sink into the grinder even when the bean bin is full."
2,Older footage,"I picked this up on Black Friday morning for my husband, as we love these documentary films. What you need to realize is that most of the footage is 20-30 years old. It's always interesting, but I expected something closer to Planet Earth, which we also have and love.If you're looking for modern-day footage AND information, spend the extra money and get Planet Earth."
1,Very nice people but HORRIBLE service,"I bought the ring for my wife. She was coming back from a long trip and wanted to surprise her (I never gave her an engagement ring). Exactly because I had read the previous comments I ordered it with time and made sure I picked the right size. You guessed, they sent me the wrong size (they blamed it on amazon).I had nothing but nice treatment from these guys, I sent it back and they promised that I would have it back on Friday. I still had enough time so I did not worry. They had 5 more days after Friday to get it to me (Wednesday). I started calling on Friday, and every time they said I would have it next day. Today is wednesday and, of course, they promise I will have it tomorrow. Too late, I cancelled. I'll let you know how the cancellation worked out."
5,Insightful and Important,"Yes: Brook is a genius.Yes: This work is of great value to any theatre artist.BUT!!! This book is rather dense, and those who are unfamiliar with major movements and theories in the last century of theater may find themselves a bit lost when Brook begins to talk about Artaud and the ""Holy Theater"" or Brecht and ""Rough Theater.""Brook's ideas, through his sometimes dense writing, are meant to inspire and invigorate. This is not a manual or even a reference to create good theatre, as a major argument of Brook's is that good theater is far to complex and ever-changing to be explained by any book/manual/dogma/etc.Read this book and know that it will not help you to create good theatre- if anything, it will raise the bar for ""good"" theatre so much higher that one's task becomes infinitely more difficult. This is the agony and the ecstasy of reading Peter Brook."
5,"It's not just about the theater, but the real life, too!?!","In case you fell into empty space, you'll be able to find yourself. Not just on the stage, or live performing, but also in your real life. The book's words are frends to all readers, and to those who hate theater or don't understand it; everyone will get a brand new view to this matter. To all who'll read this book: ""While reading this book, be patient and the fortune of new knowledge will appear! It's easy to understand the mistery of new world - theater! You'll be able to find the secrets of acting and performing forever!"" Everybody sholud read this book, because it must be known to all!"
5,Who was greater than Peter Brook?,"Although I generally find the theatre rather deadly, and haven't been to one for longer than I've been to a doctor (except for forced innoculation), Brook's films - which generally adapt his theatre to the screen - the best of their kind - to an extent DEFINE their respective eras (and I saw them in each): the vastly superior original Lord of the Flies (1963); Marat/Sade (1967); King Lear (1971 - best screen Shakespeare bar none including Olivier's Richard III, Hamlet - et al); Meetings with Remarkable Men (1979) and - the Mahabharata - well, forever! These comprise an ouvre which stands to invest this requisite analysis of the whys and wherefores of drama with unmatched credibility. Brook, the artist, has never failed to stir my soul. In this book, he delineates the ideology of why that is. In brief, he shares with us the fruits of a definitive education in drama. A work that stands on my shelf with McKee, Egri, Artaud, and very few others."
4,An innovator's ideas about Theatre,"I am not very knowledgeable about Theatre and certainly not about Theory of Theatre. I found this book quite abstract and difficult to understand. Its opening sentences sets the tone for the whole work.""I can take any empty space and call it a bare stage. An actor moves across this space while someone is watching and a piece of theatre is engaged.""This would seem to detach Theatre from local trappings and customs.The book consists in an effort to define four kinds of Theatre, the Deadly or Conventional commercial theatre: the Holy Theatre based on sacred repetition , the Rough Theatre that of people in the steet, and the Immediate Theatre, the flowing transformative Theatre which Brook himself is trying to do.As the author is considered one of the most revolutionary and important of modern Theatre directors I believe the book might be of value to those actually involved in 'doing Theatre' more than it is to the general reader."
1,garbage and a waste of time.,This dvd was total trash. It told about cube and his life growing up then it went to the good life clubbers dissing him and saying he stole there style. I was like who did the director have to screw to get this on dvd. And the end was total garabage with the last guy talking jibberish showing his tattos And the people on the street acting like they didnt want to be bothered. Dont waste your time on this on.
1,garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,man this had to be the biggest crap i have ever watched! did't even finish it i mean really wtf man! not even gonna finish talking trash bout it & to you morons who gave it more than one star stop snorting!
5,Filled with knowledge,Every questions I ever had about Cube was answered in the DVD. Ive followed this man since his N.W.A. days. And not till I watched this Video did I realize how little I actually new about him. I feel closer to him than ever and I can truly call my self a fan!
4,"Really, sweet movie for all hopeless romantics...","If you never caught this made-for-TV movie back in the late 80s, don't miss the chance to see it now. Ricki Lake is adorable & the movie is a heartfelt paean to all those who dream of a guy/girl seemingly out of your reach."
2,poor homemade copy,i love this movie. but the copy i purchased was a poorly done homemade copy.i was made to believe it was an original storebrand copy. it was not. it is awful.deborah flippen
1,Baby Cakes,"I can't believe that I searched for this item and it was really a ""b"" movie and it is $80.00 for a movie. It is not even one of the greatest movies. That is insane."
4,German Babycakes?,"I recently saw the film, and I believe it appears to be a remake of a German romantic comedy, the name which escapes me. It was identical except for a few details. I preferred the German version. I just found it to be more realistic, more mature."
5,VHS BABYCAKES,SUPER FAST SHIPPINGGreat movie.You get an A+++++Hope to business with you again.Best RegardsMary Armstrong
4,A look back to a time when Korea's economic strength was more pretense than reality,"To fully understand this book, it is necessary to have some significant knowledge of the destruction wrought by the Korean War as well as the timeframe. Published in 1957 by the International Publicity League of Korea, the goal was to show to the world that Korea was rapidly recovering from the devastation of the war. Therefore, you see images of new buildings, factories and dwellings as well as descriptions of the economic aid received from foreigners. There is no mention of the remaining devastation, land mines still buried in the country and other residue of the war.Depicting a Korea rising from the ashes of destruction, this book is but a harbinger of what was to become the economic powerhouse of South Korea, now the 14th ranked economy in the world. This book is an interesting look back to a time when this was more pretense than reality."
5,Worked as expected,"The jack was received as promised and well packaged. It was exactly as described, no issues thus far. I would buy again if need."
2,The Reiki Effect,"Mike, sorry you do much better on your own. Please don't pair up with anyone. Your music is much better by yourself. The Reiki Effect was okay, but it's not Mike Rowland. I have all you other CDs and they're wonderful."
4,A very good read!,"Buchanan, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, has woven the past and the present into multi-layered story with interesting characters, excellent dialogue and very good suspense. I was involved from the first sentence and didn't put it down until I'd read the last. Buchanan is an author who deserves much more attention than she receives. Her books aren't bloody, brutal or depressing; they are human, captivating and always worth reading."
2,formulaic,"I hadn't read this author in quite some time but remembered that I had liked what I had read so i bought this to read on a trip.I admit my memory has faded with age because I found this book to be boring,ordinary and childish."
3,Shawdows,Good beach reading does not require too much thought or imagination. Kind of mystery mind candy.
2,Answering Machine Leaves Something to be Desired,"We've had this phone for about a year and haven't been thrilled. The most disappointing is the answering machine. The outgoing message is not very clear and the incoming are scratchy and not clear either. Just this last week it finally kicked the bucket. I thought it was just the battery but we've replaced it and it still is not working. I'm searching for a replacement now, won't be buying another one of these though."
1,"Low Volume Handset, Won't Hold Charge, Poor Sound Quality AM",The handset is WAY too quiet and will not keep a charge. Both the outgoing and incoming messages are of poor sound quality. Don't even consider purchasing this product no matter the price.
2,get what you pay for,The 9 button works sporadically. Needs a new battery but had a hard time finding one and cost was half as much as a new phone. Phone only a little more than a year old.
3,"Sweatin' to the Oldies 2, great for some people","I haven't used the whole DVD as of writing this review. I'm 53 years old and 80# overweight, with a bit of an asthma issue, so it is a decent workout for me. It will take me a while to get the workout sequences/dance steps down, but I am enjoying it so far. If you are young and/or in decent physical shape, I don't think the video will be much of a challenge."
4,Sweating to the Oldies does it Again!,"This version is a bit longer, and has more variety (there are some floor exercises). The quality and fun factor are as same as the first."
4,Fun ! and Effective!,"Old School music with silly, childlike moves...Losing weight has never been sooooo much fun!"
5,Love this workout video,"I love this video. It is fun & easy to follow. It gives me just the right amount of low impact arobics. At age 58 and having lost over 80 pounds (45 to go) this is perfect. It is helping me to continue to lose, and have fun at the same time. I recommend this to anyone."
2,Should've checked it out at Library before buying,I seriously should've checked this dvd out at the library before buying. I was not at all impressed. I thought this would be more like the tv shows when Richard Simmons was on television years ago and for 30 minutes you received a easy work out with clear instructions. I've exercised with this video only one time since buying and it will probably just gather dust in my house.
1,Sweatin to the Oldies 2 DVD,"Unfortunately the product was delivered to me totally destroyed. I've returned for full refund, including S&H but will reorder in hopes that the next order will be delivered undamaged."
4,Great for beginners,"If your truely just starting to work out then this is definitely a great start, when I first started doing this workout I was already some what active so it wasn't as heart pumping as I hoped, I have to admit the music is on the cheesy side but you really get over it once you see the fun they're having in the video, it really is good if you have knee problems in that the workout has very little hopping and squatting"
5,Sweatin for sure,This is better than the original. I was sore after using this one. The floor time really adds to the aerobic section. Love Richard. Just keeps it all upbeat and real. Would love to have the box set with all the sweatin' videos!
4,Great beginner workout,"This is a great dvd if you are just starting an exercise program. It will get you moving, is an easy level and will help you get to know your body. The music is upbeat and Richard's positive attitude will keep you moving."
4,"Science, religion, and politics clash.","This is a futuristic story about the discovery of a medical procedure that enables recently deceased people (from natural causes) to be brought back to life. The protagonist, who is a former well known politician, is solicited to represent a private company that discovered the procedure. He agrees to try to gather support from current politicians, who must legalize the procedure, and from religious and public groups. The story is well told, and the moral and ethical considerations are surprisingly realistic andthoughtful. The problem is complicated by the fact that the procedure is not foolproof, and that some will be brought back to physical life, but without any mental activity. This is a typicalclassic Silverberg story, and is thought provoking."
1,POOR CASTING,"I beg to differ with the other reviewers. I have read a couple of the Sayers books (Gaudy Night and The Nine Tailors come to mind). I don't remember much about the books, except that I wasn't keen on reading them all. But I love mysteries and I've seen all the Wimsey eipsodes made for television, those with Ian Carmichael and those with Edward Petherbridge. The Carmichael episodes are far better, for my money. Carmichael's Wimsey is charming, sparkling, a little quirky and fun, a man you want to know. Petherbridge is glum, looks very tired and bored. I don't believe he's attracted to Harriet, no matter how many times he says so. There is nothing in his eyes. And Harriet!!! There's a snotty cow. Usually looks like she's revolted by a nasty smell. Nope, nothing anybody could fall in love with there either. Whether it was a careful recreation of the characters in the books or just the casting of two particularly unsympathetic people, it just doesn't cut it."
2,A Deep Disappointment,"Gaudy Night has long been my favorite Lord Peter Wimsey--or perhaps I should say, Harriet Vane detective story. There's no doubt Sayers recreated Oxford lovingly and with extreme vividness. Harriet Vane fully comes into her own in this story. The TV adaptation, however, is truncated, simplified almost beyond recognition. The various characters are cardboard stereotypes. The deepening relationship between Wimsey and Harriet is reduced to cliches. Why in the world were 4 episodes lavished on a much lesser story, ""Have His Carcase"" and only three on ""Gaudy Night"". This version simply doesn't do the original story justice at all."
2,Not enough!,"I don't think this book can help you develop read-world applications. There are not enough contents for database and networking which are the most important and useful for enterprise applications.The better chapter would be the 'App-centric Networking'. It mentions some web connection with the Palm. But this book still have no discussion with the HotSync, a important part of Palm development.Most of the contents just help you develop stand-alone programs. I agree that you can read the SDK documentations for more information, or the Palm OS Programming Bible."
2,Glad I bought this used....,"If you find this book for less than $12 USD somewhere, it's probably worth the money just to look at some more code samples. However, the examples in this book are buggy, and are hard to isolate and recycle into your own projects.If you have the Neil Rhodes book from O'Reilly and/or the PalmOS Programming Bible from Wiley, then don't bother with this title at all."
2,What was advanced about this book?,"I am a professional Palm developer, and I currently have four books on Palm programming at my desk. This is by far the worst, and the least informative. I'm not sure what is in this that would let it claim to be 'advanced'. Everything covered in this book was summarily covered in Neil Rhodes' book. I always open it up, trying to find something useful, but it's just not in there. Don't waste your money. I've given it two stars, just in case you don't have Rhodes' book, you might find some small value in it."
1,A weak attempt.,"This book is a weak attempt at explaining Palm OS programming. Save your money. Here is a summary of the book.""Read the SDK. Hey look at these code samples. Details are boring. So here are some more code samples. You want details go read the SDK.""Poorly written and horribly organized.I'm still looking for a good Palm OS book."
3,Glad I bought it,"For me, not having to search around for empty VCR tapes is just wonderful.Maybe this is only my problem, but I just can't figure out how to record cable TV programs with timer. When I am away from home, I can only record programs from one channel...Also, it took me three weeks to connect the cable box, TV and the recorder properly because the cable technician refused with the phrase ""That's too much technology for me""!!Otherwise, It's working fine and I am glad I bought it!"
1,Can't switch cable tv channels,"I bought this unit to replace my broken replay tv with a unit that could do long term archiving on to dvdr. When I got the unit, I thought it was a beautiful unit, but after I set it up, I couldn't figure out how to get the unit to change channels on my cable box. Then, I read in the manual that it COULDN'T! What good is a Tivo like unit, with hard drive recording capabilities if you can't schedule a recording without manually setting the channel??? It's completely useless without the ability to change channels. I mean really, what's the point with the VCR+? Why did they even bother with the hard drive? I can't believe there's 89 reviews here and not ONE of them makes any big deal out of this. This unit is only good if you want to transfer stuff to dvd from a video source, otherwise, PASS on it!"
3,disappointed,"Everything is great except the ability of us and the set to record and then play it back on another DVD player. How do we do this? It should be with a button or two. This IS the hi-tech. age. The set should do it automatically. When we purchased it, another reviewer had commented that to make the DVD's compatible with another player, ""just turn on the 'compatible mode' when recording, if you want to play it on another player."" Well we can't find that. And it DOES tell us that it is ""finalizing"" when we finish recording. But so far we are unable to do what needs to be done to play the finished DVD on our Sony DVD player since the DVD recorder is a panasonic. This is disappointing to us novices."
1,Worked fine for three weeks,"Then turned it on today, went right to the formatting HDD display. Tries to format, then says 'formatting is failed.' So I went to the panasonic web page, and it claims there are no repeat no service centers within 3000 miles of washington dc. how crazy is that? When it worked, it was great--after trying to figure out the manual that is.update: shipped it off to panasonic service center and got it back within three weeks. now to plug it in... anyone want to bet on how long it lasts???"
5,I could NOT be happier.,"I hate that some people have had problems with this unit.. I have created hunderds of hours of DVD's, record lots of shows each week. When the unit was about 2 years old, the hard drive did fail, replaced it myself for 75 bucks. You just have to make sure to buy compatible DVD's, it is a little picky. I buy bulk DVD's that sre silver surfaced, 2x. You will make lots of coasters if you try to use walmart high speed DVD's."
2,Lasted almost 2 years... I expected more,"This unit worked great for almost 2 years. Now, I cannot record anything from the hard drive to the DVD. I get the same ""RECOVER"" message a lot of people are getting and the unit reboots. At this point, I can still record to the hard drive and watch programs at a later time. I'm wondering how long that will even last now. I wouldn't be surprised if a cheap unit broke so soon... but I paid a lot of money for this and expected much more."
3,Great unit when it works,"I have had this unit for 2+ years, and it is a terrific machine, until it breaks. I too enjoy the high quality recordings, and the ability to record to hard drive, edit (get rid of those commercials!), and then record to DVD -R or -RAM. However, my unit has recently stopped writing to DVD -R format, giving me the ""Recovery"" message, and then ""Bye"". When I took it in for repair, I was told that it would be at least $320. When I called the large store where I bought it, they told me not to get it fixed as it wasn't worth it, but rather to buy a new one. Given that I have about 70 hours of stored programming on it, I really don't want to throw it away (it works well as a DVR machine now), but spending $500+ to buy it 2 years ago, and $320+ to fix it is way too much. Panasonic should allow a trade-in allowance to one of their more reliable units."
2,Buy the extended warrantee!!,"They have NOT perfected this technology yet. This is my third machine. I sent back the first and second and kept the third. It has been to the repair shop for a month of repair because it took so long ordering parts. Now I find myself needing to reformat the hard drive every two weeks or so, losing everything I have on it. If you buy this, have plenty of patience and buy the extended warrantee. You are going to need it!!If you are planning on using this to put your movie VHS on to DVDs, don't buy this model either. The copyguard that is built in will prevent you from using this for most professional videos. Buyer beware!"
4,watching one program and recording another (cable users),"This is what I do...Split the signal from the cable, and route one signal to the digital converter, then to the dvd recorder. Route the other to the regular RF input on the tv. While recording one show, you can watch another through the separate tv input. You might not get the ""digital"" out of your digital converter on the RF input, but it serves my needs.You could even split the signal in three, and put the third straight to the dvd recorder RF input, and make use of VCR+ capabilities.... I think.Bear with me, I'm new to this.I love my DMR-E80H!!"
2,problems,I have returned this DVD recorder to be repaired twice. This is the same problem with a previous panasonic DVD recorder.
2,Not Worth the Money with DirecTV,"I purchased this hoping to be able to record shows from DirecTV either when I was not home or when watching another show. The instruction booklet barely addressed connecting to a satellite (there are only several million of us using them). It is one of the most poorly written manuals I've ever seen. When I figured out how to get it connected and be able to record a show I was watching at the time, the picture quality was mediocre. I really wanted to use it for recording when I was watching something else. When I called Panasonic support (a number I found online, it's not in the poorly written manual), the recording warned me of hold times of 18 minutes. It ended up being over an hour. The rep that helped me explained that the system isn't really designed to work the way I wanted. It's being returned. What a disappointment, I guess I'll be going to a Tivo. I WILL NEVER BUY PANASONIC AGAIN. This is why I usually but Sony."
2,Horrible Warranty - Bad Customer Service,"Since it's not posted on any of their products, I thought you should know that Panasonic DVD products come with a 90 days warranty on labor and 1 year on parts. That means when your unit breaks in 6 months, (Hard drive fails, motherboard dies, drive breaks) the part will be covered, but they will charge you the labor to install it! On a unit at this price, you might consider it worth it, but on cheaper DVD players, the labor costs more than the players themselves, so you just have to trash it and buy a Philips.BUYER BEWARE"
2,great while it lasted,This was a Christmas present last year and just over the one-year anniversary the laser part of the DVD reader gave out. I was told it would be $200. plus to repair it.Pretty steep price for a one year lifespan.
1,Unit dead after 6 months,"After 6 months of using this unit it went completely dead. I took it to an authorized Panasonic repair service center several weeks ago. The service center told me that the needed part, a circuit board, was backordered from Panasonic. The service center also told me that 3 different promise shipment dates for the needed part were not met by Panasonic and there was little they could do. So today, I am still without any idea when the unit will be repaired. I would avoid this unit."
2,The dreaded recover and crash,"I love the advertised features of the DMR-80. When it wants to work it's great. I have had it less than a month and I am packing it up for a trip to the repair center in Texas. Video is jittery through the unit and every time I try to record directly to a DVD-r or DVD Ram it goes into recover mode. It then resets and goes into recover mode again and then goes BYE! Recordings to the HDD seem fine but even dubbing from HDD to DVD-R usually crashes by going into recover mode and then shutdown. I'll be sending the unit out this week. We'll see what the turn around time is and if they really fix the unit. So far very disappointed in video quality and inability to do the very thing I purchased the unit for, that is burn DVD's"
5,Great product and some misleading warranty statements,"I don't want to go over all the good posts about this product because I agree with them and this is a grat machine. But I want to clarify that this DVD recorder has a 1 (ONE) YEAR PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY as stated in page 60 on the manual. I don't think is fair and honest to mislead possible customers posting false statements and I just wanted to contribute with my $.02Buy with confidence and don't trust everyone on the cyberspace. And no, I don't work for Panasonic ;)"
1,Guys don't buy this Panasonic DMR-E80H,"I have this recorder for about year.For first 6-8 mon. work OK but two weeks ago start my problems.I can't record any program.Try contact Panasonic this is just lost time,customer service just help me make sure that,never buy anything whith Panasonic name. $500 is to much to pay for this recorder.Guy in repair shop ask me $375 to fix.This Panasonic product is good only for how long is his Limited Warranty."
2,Forget it!,"If you want to use this unit, go to college and get a technical degree first or you will go insane trying to make it work. Nothing is easy these days, nothing! To use this kind of unit, you better make sure you have everything Panasonic first, then you better go to their training schools to learn the ever expanding technical complications of these units and all units in this or any area. It's insane, nothing works easily or simply. All I wanted to do was record my VHS collection to DVD...good luck. I can't even get it to play a dvd! Tech suppost is obnoxious. But hey, this is only Panasonic, try SOny..or Dell, the are hidious and horrible. TOO many companies, too complicated, too much BS. Life shouldn't be this crazed!"
5,Choosing An Offshore - Cybertax in the New Millenium,Thought the book was wonderful. Very informative and gave me great ideas on how to invest my money. Dr. Grosh made it easy for people without any investing knowledge to learn how to save money by putting it offshore.
1,Over-priced,$14.99 for this book is not in keeping with the 'low cost Kindle Edition's' Amazon promised. Greedy publishers at their best.
5,You must read The Madam,"Julianna Baggott's third novel, The Madam, is an incredible story of strength and suffering. Built with poetic language and a riveting narrative, The Madam is a must read for book groups, classes, and individuals. This is a different style for Baggott after her debut, Girl Talk and her fabulous follow-up, The Miss America Family. But if you look carefully at the themes, the poetic prose, the lovable and insane cast of characters, you'll find that The Madam is all Baggott."
2,A poet's take on the oldest profession,"While I had eagerly awaited this ""luminous and epic piece of literature"" about a West Virginia madam, I consider it a testament to my fortitude and love of reading that I finished this book. It is an ONEROUS read. The story is a sad testament to a hard life in hard times and would have made an excellent read if it were not peppered throughout with lines such as,""there was her mother, windblown and soaking, ripping clothes off the line, her mother, a crazy woman, a screeching gull, drowning, crying out, the sheets wet and swelling as sails,"" and ""everything returns to her in a blurred rush motored by the intricate mechanisms of her raucous heart."" These lines and many others like them negate the gritty reality of the setting and drag the unwary reader through an endless mire of obfuscating prose."
3,Not a literary page- turner,This is not the literary page-turner that the inside jacket suggests. This was juat an ok book. I'm still not sure if it was worth reading. The book starts off very slow and didn't pick up until the second half. Then there's just too much going on with everything being crammed into part two. There isn't enough dialogue between the characters. Just a bunch of insight into their thoughts. The ending wasn't too great either. A really great book that has a simalar plot is The Crimson Petal and The White by Michael Faber. I suggest that you read that before The Madam if at all.
3,Laura Murdoch storyline concludes,"Laura Murdoch Collins summons her son, David, to an old fishing shack, hoping that he will burn with her as the structure goes up in flames. Sam Evans gives Roger Collins an ultimatum, threatening to tell Burke Devlin that Roger bribed him to keep quiet about the manslaughter case.There's too much hysterical screaming during the fishing shack fire for my tastes (although the effects are quite good for chromakey). ""Fire!"" ""David!"" ""Fire!"" ""David!"" ad infinitum. On the plus side, though, there's Dennis Patrick's first appearance as the lovable Jason McGuire."
4,Great fundamentals,"This book was extremely helpful. I've been doing radio production for years but never had any formal training in mixing, processing, etc. The specifics in this book helped me in so many ways, I wish that I'd known about it long ago. There are places where it doesn't go into enough detail but, it is great for getting a grip on the basics."
3,Not what I was looking for,I did find some useful info in this book but the buyer should know that this book is almost completely for the studio and not for any type of live sound setting.
5,"Glam tinged, romantic 70's hard rock record-KILLER!!","Valley of the Dolls is a very glam tainted and romantic early 70's sounding record. It has Sweet and Mott the Hoople written all over it. No wonder b/c it was produced by Ian Hunter. This type of ""dreamer"" record fit GenX very well; their first record was a similiar slice of thrash punk about the streets/ladies/drugs/violence. This one really knocks it up w/ big/dramatic production and hard rock guitars (""Night of the Cadillacs"" and ""Love Like Fire"" are some of the most pumping things I've ever heard) There's also the epic delicate ballad: ""Prime of Kenny Silvers"". I remember growing up and getting lost in the headphones w/""Kenny Silvers."" This is one of the few 'real' albums that came out of the UK punk period. Definitely THE most profound thing Billy Idol's ever done"
4,Classic Punk!,"You can't talk about Punk Rock and overlook the contributions of Generation X. Most will instantly recognize a fresh faced Billy Idol who was all of about 17 years of age at the time of the bands first release.Although ""Valley of the Dolls"" contains some great tracks (King Rocker, Night of the Cadillacs, Kenny Silvers etc.)and shows some growth and sophistication in the bands writting ability I would recommend the bands debut release (Generation-x) as a proper introduction to the bands music and old school punk. You just can't overlook Generation-X classics like ""Kiss me Deadly, 100 Punks and Ready Steady Go!"". However, the Bonus track of the Who's ""Shakin All Over"" on Valley of the dolls CD will be enough for some to make this album a worthy purchase. Although I recommend this album, I would suggest those unfamiliar with Generation X check out the ""Perfect Hits"" CD first.NOTE: ""Shakin all over"" is also available on a rare CD called ""The Idol Generation"""
4,Excellent pre Buckingham/ Nicks Fleetwood Mac,"If you don't have the Live Boston Tea Party CDs this will give you a little taste, plus excellent versions of the Peter Green era songs."
3,Way too short on total running time.,"It says approx. 90 minutes on the cover but the total time is only 42 minutes. I felt cheated. I want half of my money back. I'm not going to buy any more DVD from Multimedia 2000.Oh, about the video? Fascinating footages. Can't get enough of them."
3,Brother vs. Brother,"Gunshots ring. A drumbeat rolls out like thunder, the pounding of feet marching. A gunshot, then a scream. Someone breaks away from the crowd and makes for the woods. Someone yells, ""Skedaddler!"" Patricia Beatty weaves some suspense and adventure in her book Charley Skedaddle.Imagine the horror of shooting someone for the first time. Would you run or fight?Charley Quinn ran, branding himself a coward. Charley Quinn is searching for his lost brother. Fate leads him to war, as a drummer boy. He meets his brother's best friend, hoping against hope, only to find his brother had died in a battle at Gettysburg.Patricia Beatty has a certain style. Her endings for chapters are sometimes interesting cliffhangers. The ending is not that exciting but certain parts are interesting. I wouldn't really recommend this book to any reader thirsting for a lot adventure and excitement. 6th grade student of OHES."
3,Drummerboy deserts the Union and learns an important lesson.,"It was okay, I personally, thought it was boring. It had great history facts in it though. I liked the book ""Bull Run"" a lot more."
1,charley Skedaddle,"i hated this book it was terrible! we had to read it for school it was like jail we were forced to read it i hate the book. so far it is so confusing and it is quite stupid, so if i were you i wouldnt read it at all. dont even pick up the book!!!"
4,charley skedaddle,CHARLIE SKEDADDLEThe title of my book is Charlie Skedaddle. This book is about wars and big mistakes.I really like Charlie because he's not afraid of anything. This book tells that you shouldn't get into things that you cant get out of. I really liked how Charlie reacted when he got in to the war and I didn't really like how they just keep on fighting. I liked the ending a lot because everything was perfect.I think the auther would keep anyone reading this book. I think the auther makes book really good. Some people might not know some of the vocabulary. I liked how the auther wrote this book. This book is more for age's 11 and up. I would recommend this book. I give this book ****...
3,Charley Skedaddle,"Charley Skedaddle is a Civil War book about a boy named Charley who lives in the Bowery, New York. When he sees his friend marching through town with his regiment he decides he should join up. He is not old enough to enlist so they make him a drummer boy. He wants to fight to get revenge for his brother who died at Gettysburg. When he gets into battle as a drummer he finds out that fighting is not exactly the fun he thought it would be. He runs and hides to wait for the battle to be over. When it is over he leaves and becomes a deserter. He meets up with and old woman who takes him in.Charley Skedaddle is a pretty good book with some good historical events taking place throughout it. It will surprise you and give you a good look at what battle was like."
1,A FLOP!,"This is NOT the Raiders I grew up hearing. Mark Lindsay, the fabulous original lead singer of the band is NOT a part of this remake. His strong vocals are sorely missed here.Don't waste your money on this one- rather buy the real thing...pick up recordings from the band when Lindsay was still with them (1972 and before)."
1,Thank you for the insight.,"Richard,Thank you for the information. I was hoping it was a series of recordings from concerts of 1967-72. I am not interested in the 1980s version of Paul and the Raiders shifting personnel. The cover is certainly deceiving with a picture of the circa 1967 Raiders."
3,Not the Raiders in their Prime,This is a recording of a live show from the 1980's. It's fun but that's about it. They are now basically a cover band. I was lucky enough to see Paul and The Raiders in 1990 in a club in New York City. This is a good souvenier of the performance. There are no liner notes included in the C.D and the sound is average.
3,decent live show from 1991,"This is a good live recording of this awesome rock band from probably 19991 , when this was released in holland on cd. I don't know but this isn't the classic raiders for sure. NOone has released a recording of them live after their early live period. Still I saw this band more than once and it's a great show and these guys deserve to be in the rock and roll hall of fame. It's not the original group but it's still fun. I wouldn't pay alot for this though. I paid a good price for this out of print cd but if it's more than 20.00 then forget about it. The sound is good and the music is good though with versions of all their big hits on here as well."
5,The Best CD,"I am in my 30's and grew up listening to Al Downing as a child. I was always touched by the Mr. Jones song as a child and since I have grown up and moved on I always wanted to hear that song from time to time and could never remember who had sang it. Well, I found it finally and about broke down crying I was so happy to hear it again. This whole CD is wonderful if you like the older country and western music, back when country didn't have the pop sound it does today. I highly recommend this CD, I also got the CD for my father who got me started on country as wee little child!"
3,I just returned from Jamaica and this book was of no help!,"For example, the book lists a tour company for Ocho Rios. I called the company and they stated they do not even tour the area. In addition, with no photos of the attractions described, the book is useless. The airport gift shops had better Jamaican books than this one.In addition, the book is suppose to be the source on Jamaica yet doesn't mention the bath area or the healing springs at all. I would not recommend this book."
1,Not just useless... recklessly misleading,"Every restaurant they say is great has been terrible; every one they say is average has been great. One of the restaurants they recommend in Mo Bay has been closed for two years... ""worth the trip up the hill""... not really.Where the tennis is recommended, it's not actually available to people not staying at the resort. Where the ""tourists mingle with the locals"", it's... just... nasty.We're loving Montego Bay and we're staying at the most amazing B&B; (Polkerris) ever. Come to Montego Bay... but don't buy this book!"
5,Jamaica,Great resource. Gave us what we needed. Especially liked the explanation of what each city was like and its personality.
4,Space imagination,"Arty the part-time astronaut is a great package for my son to learn about the space above our heads. When you buy the book you gain a pass to a special member website. This is a great place for my kid to find new space related facts and play new games and activities. The CD-ROM was a great thing about the package, plenty of engaging interactive stuff for a kid to do. We really enjoyed finding out how much he weighed, and how old we would be on other planets. I found the story of the book to be average, but the computer generated 3d artwork was full of color and space imagination."
3,Just average,I think that this is a mediocre espresso machine. The water passes through the coffee grounds so fast that it really tastes more like a cup of coffee than a cup of espresso. The steamer works fine though if you prefer cappuccino or lattes.
3,Not the best for small glass tiles,"I ordered a pair of these to cut approximately two centimeter glass tiles. These pliers worked, but were difficult to use on the small tiles. My guess is that they would work just fine on larger tiles, but can't say for sure without having testing them for that purpose. For smaller tiles, my rec is to buy a glass cutter and buy the glass cutting pliers that have dual cutting wheels. Score the glass with the glass cutter first, then cut with the pliers. You will be ever so happy with the easy effort and the clean lines of the cuts."
2,glass/tile cutter,"I purchased this glass and tile cutter for a bathroom project. After practicing curved and straight cuts I've decided to go a different route. I'm just planning to use it to cut tile pieces around the toilet, but I know that I will be breaking some in the process. It's a good thing that I purchased some extra tile pieces. If you're looking to any type of tile work I would not recommend this product, because it takes a lot of pressure and it has a poor grip. I haven't tried it on glass cutting, but I'm guessing it would work well for that.good: fast deliverybad: Not a very good tile cutter, horrible grip"
1,how does it work?,"Bought this product for a glass project ,pliers came with no instructions. When i tried to break tile after scoring it chipped.Would not reccomend."
3,Upcomming Star,"This album was disappointing in a way. It is a good album and Wayne is lyrically gifted but I have heard way better songs from Wayne on many mix tapes and I expected more out of this one. There are good party songs like ""Feeling it"", ""In The Club"", ""Why"", ""Overcome"", and my favorite ""Marshall Town"" I guess he was going for a more mello and righteous mood for this album. But I know for sure that his next album is going to be ""Fire"""
3,Marshall In Town,"I wasn't sure about this CD but because I have heard Wayne Marshall in some collabo tunes mainly Vybz Kartel and Bounty Killa, I gave it a shot.It's not great and it's not bad at all..There are some good tunes in the CD, Zone Out, Natural Mystic to name a few and souple of more.Chu chu Chum, marshall in town."
3,OK,"I thought that alot of things in the book you would already know by commom sense, and alot of stuff only happenes once in a hundred years. Of coures it's good to show stuff that happens once in awile.I thought it was OK."
3,Acceptable quality and arrived quickly.,"It would be helpful if this ""self-help"" type book had a suggested age range. I had assumed that since it was from American Girl it would be appropriate for a nine year old but discovered that some of the material was inappropriate for younger than teenage girls."
2,Guide to Sticky Situations - book,Disappointed that it could not be read on my e-Reader - I do not like to read a book on a computer screen so this file sits unused and undisturbed. There should have been a clear warning ...
4,satisfied,This was a gift for my daughter. She loves to read but is very picky when it comes to finding a book she actually likes. So when she add this to her birthday list I didn't question it. She is very happy with the book and I recommend this book for other girls m daughters age(11).
3,Okay,"This book has some very helpful advice for girls (such as what to do if you get your period unexpectantly), but I wish that there had been more helpful advice for day to day sticky situations. All in all though, pretty good."
3,Girl Books,Before your young lady starts Junior High School please add this litle book to her library. This books offers answers to the preteen on handling situations that could be potentially embarrassing. This book will help your child develop more self-assurance.
5,GREAT!,"Now why did my mom never give me books like this? I think this book is just great! I even enjoyed reading it and seeing what they had to say. It is your basic stuff, ""how to deal with a mean girl"", etc. I would get this one!"
1,Video good - motors sound like a washing machine,"This machine does a good job as a S-VHS machine. However, its motors grind away like a washing machine. If you can put it in the next room with the door shut, buy it."
3,Lost sound after 18 months,"I notice another reviewer reports losing sound output after 18 months. Exactly the same thing happened to me. Otherwise, I have been satisfied."
3,Confusion over Model Numbers?,Panasonic lists this an an S-VHS VCR for $100 more (retail) than it is listed here. Other sites also agree with Panasonic's site. I suggest someone review the details. Here is Panasonic's link:http://www.prodcat.panasonic.com/shop/templates/rect_template.asp?ModelId=8845&show_all=false&product_exists=True&active=1&ModelNo=PV-VS4820
1,A store display.,"After contacting Eagle Vision, here's what I found out. This item is actually a ""retail only"" store display of the Johnny Cash ""Live at Montreux"" concert for Eagle Vision U.S.A.. It is picture ""strips"" of the show (6 of them) pasted on a box for display. That's it! Can you believe that? Someone dropped the ball on this one. Just thought I'd let you know before you dish out some hard earned cash on something that isn't available."
3,Richard Simmons: Sweat and Shout,"I like this DVD, but would recommend it to people looking for something a little less rigorous. Although he's got you moving for the full 60 minutes (it's filmed as one continous session, which I like) he switches from move to move so quickly that it's hard to follow the first few times. In fact, you spend the first few viewings watching him so closely that you don't really build up that much of a sweat. Then after you've mastered the moves the tape becomes significantly less challenging. I would have appreaciated a seperate section that teaches the moves and then a clearly marked indicator telling you which level of aerobic exercise you were undertaking with each song. However, he's so energetic and encouraging that this dvd purchase doesn't feel like a mistake, and you can always take his moves and modify his routine to make it more demanding."
2,Cut and Paste,Looks like Whitaker House (the publisher of this book) did another one of it's bang up cut and paste jobs. I have purchased a lot of Spurgeon books and this is the first I have NOT liked. It's been ard to finish this book and I can't think of ANYONE I would recommend it to. Sorry.
3,Conant Copper thermometer,Copper is lovely. The inside is some paper and has already started to warp either from heat or moisture. I should have hung it where it is not exposed to the weather. A good blast of wind makes it swivel away where I can't see it. Have to adjust it after a strong wind.
1,Is this a knock-off?,"I bought this in April '08, but didn't get it outside until May. When it was 88 degrees outside according to the car and a local bank, the thermometer read 110 degrees. I agree with another reviewer about the paper face. I didn't have mine long enough for it to warp, but it sure looked cheap and like it would warp one day. I returned mine and Amamzon only refunded $26. Not so good for a defective item. I'll amend this review if they decide to give me a full refund. I'm not at all convinced that this item is made by Conant. I think it's a fake."
2,Would not choose this again,"This was much smaller than I thought it would be. It is hung outside the window but unless we get right next to the window we cannot see the numbers, and even then we have to really look to see."
1,Conant Copper Weather Station,"I received this Conant Copper weather station but the dial was broken when received. I called Amazon.com and they quickly supplied return postage and refunded my charge.If the dial was not broken and if the temperature dial had worked well, the quality looked good. But I would not recommend this to you as the shipping may cause the dial to fall off. I've seen similar (1/3 the cost) temperature dials at Lowes with some of the dials broken. Its not a robust design."
3,It could be more accurate....,"This was the first combined temp/humidity gauge that I bought from Conant Custom Brass. I've purchased two sets of individual gauges from Conant and have been pleased until I checked the humidity against two digital gauges. Both indicated that the Conant gauges were 10 points higher than the digital reading. Humidity levels are critical for my musical instruments and I'm wondering if I made the right choice with this brand. They look great, the temperature gauge works but the humidity gauge is in question."
1,"For me, worthless!","Constantly reads eight to twelve degrees too high. And, it occasionally remains static without changing at all. Some copies may be fine, but mine is just a waste of money and materials."
2,Misleading photo - not accurate at all!,The dimensions given must have been measured with a tape measure that has been cut and taped together. This wittle weather station can barely be seen out my country house kitchen window. It is cheesey and the temperature is about 4 degrees lower than it really is. The humidity cannot be seen unless you are up close with a magnifying glass. The only good thing is I will be able to tell my summer guests you really don't need air conditioning.
2,"Beautiful, but inaccurate...","This is a beautiful item, but unfortunately, it reads the temp outside as 5 degrees lower than it actually is. I have yet to contact the company about a return... so is life with a 2 year old and holiday insanity... perhaps we just received one ""off"" item. Again, it's beautiful, but is not up to snuff."
2,Most will probably find this book useful but it left me annoyed.,"First I want to say that there are a number of good points and areas of this book that will provide comfort to many. BUT for those who are well read on the subject of death and dying this book leaves a bit to be desired. I think I could have been more invested in this book if the author had written it from something other than the ""I"" perspective..,to use a previous reviewers term. Additionally, it could have been much more inclusive of people who either don't believe in any god or believe in a different spiritual or emotional guide in their lives. Some of the analogies are a bit cheesy and I found myself doing a bit of eye rolling and saying ""give me a break"". The issue of dying is emotional enough without needing to add empty sentiment such as ...the loss of a grain of sand impacts the world. A bit much for my taste. For a more inclusive and less self-absorbed perspective I would recommend Final Gifts over this book."
5,Indispensable!,"This is the book that has guided and supported me as a hospice social worker over the past 8 years. Kessler brings clarity and wisdom about the needs of the dying that can be used by everyone involved in the process, including the dying individual and their loved ones. My copy is so dog eared, highlighted and annotated, I bought another copy today. I also appreciate how well the book is organized. I never fail to find an answer to a question I am thinking about or some wit or wisdom to help me solve a problem with a patient. Thank you, David, for writing this book! Anyone interested in ""bringing hope, comfort and love to life's final chapter"" will find much to help them in this book."
3,needs of the dying,"the author is to much in the zone of ""I"". I have difficulty reading writings of those who are to much in the ""I"". I think using the words we or they at times tends to make the reading much more palatalable"
3,Secret Identities,"When a fire leaves a town rather unsettled, a few friends start talking about the car explosion. If you are used to chatting online, this book will even be more interesting to you although you have to keep track of a lot of characters all hiding behind their screen names.Marty Shepherd is the principal character in this story and unwittingly becomes involved in the adventures of a variety of characters, moving in and out of their lives and exposing their secrets.As PrettyLie says: ""careful 297 - we all have secrets and I know some of yours.""Let's just say that during this novel, the police force is kept very busy. There are a lot of newspaper articles, letters, video tapes, internet messaging and chatting going on.I can see this type of book becoming quite common in this age of internet life. Will appeal to those who enjoy lurking online.For those who enjoy multiple plots, puzzles, internet chat rooms and mystery.~The Rebecca Review"
5,The Best,"I am 25 yr.s Old and Adore this perfume... There's nothing like it!! No matter how old you are this perfume seem's to turn head and have everyone asking "" Oh wow, What perfume is that""??"
4,Great price,Gifted it for christmas. Loved the price for the ounces. Mother in law super happy with gift. Would recommend to anyone.
3,Bouquett of flowers,"I had high hopes for this perfume. I ordered a sml bottle based on reviews but was very dissapointed once I tried it.It litteraly smells like a bouquett of flowers, and to my nose, a strong smell of roses.The scent is nothing special. It does not last long on my skin. A couple hours at most and for the price it should last all day long.My bf said it was ""okay"". He preferes my other perfums and really likes my body lotions and sprays . Good, it's cheaper!Dont waste your money on this perfume. It's nothing special."
5,Well organized information on SAP HR,"I found it to be well researched, and the sections are set up in a logical way, so finding specific info is pretty easy. I have been working on sap hr for 3 years, but it's 80% self-taught, on the job... I don't usually buy books to read them cover to cover, I buy books to solve a certain problem or use as a constant reference. This book really helps a person like me, actualy I just used some of techniques the enhancing reports and it worked easily. There lots of additional stuff on 4.7 and also ESS that looks interesting but that I might never use. Either way I'd recommend it if you want the most current book on this SAP HR."
5,Excellent,This book covers many topics and answers a lot of important questions raised in regards to evolution and creation. The authors point out how questions that have turned people away from God are easily answered when we look at the Bible and scientific evidence.
5,GREAT Resource,"This book has the atheists blowing smoke out of their ears. They know that this book threatens their fantasy world of atheism. If they had the courage to actually read this book they would learn a lot, and it just might change their lives. Who knows.This book is the perfect Christmas gift for either a believer or a sceptic. I highly recommend this book, it is badly needed in today's world.5 stars well deserved!"
1,Ham is destroying creationism,"Ham keeps teaching his biblical distortions about science. Science and the bible don't support evolution, but both also support an old-earth. Ham takes his personal beliefs and forces them into the bible without understanding of it or science. For a book that upholds the validity of the bible, read don stoner's ""a new look at an old earth"", 1997 edition, and I guarntee every young-earth supporter will see why ham is wrong and why they should change their mind."
5,Excellent!!!!!,"Wonderful, excellent, brillent, etc. This is a great book for adults and children alike. It answers the hard ones!"
1,Ham needs to reread his bible,"I agree with Ham that man didn't evolve. Most Christians do. But most are now seeing that Earth wasn't created in 6 days. Ham is one of many who think an old-Earth means we had to evolve. It does not in anyway. The Bible supports an old-Earth no matter how hard Ham tries to explain around it. If Christians were to study the science God created and what the bible rally says, they will find that it does NOT support evolution but DOES support an old Earth."
1,Young-earthism continues to fuel skeptics,"It is books like this that embarass Christians. Skeptics hold them up as reasons not to trust the Bible. Young-earthism is not the literal translation of the Bible, nor does old age = evolution. Young-earthers have replaced good biblical and scientific scholarship with thier own personal beliefs. They have abandoned real science and the strongest intelligent design evidences (big bang, old age, etc). Help turn back the damage done by young-earthers. Check out Hugh Ross' ""A Matter of Days"" and Don Stoner's ""A New Look at an Old Earth."" for more on this issue before you blindly believe what young-earthers tell you just becuase they are ""Christians."""
1,The Answers Are Wrong!,"The author attempts to answer twenty questions from a young earth perspective. Several of the questions are irrelevent to the creationist debate. The rest are full of young earth creationist arguments which are easy to rebut. Overall, no evidence is presented to indicate that the earth is young. For a full review, see www.answersincreation.org/bookreview.htm."
2,Better for Tunes,"Yes it fits and is easy to apply. It's clear so seeing the screen is fine. But the rubbery feel of the material makes it difficult to write with the stylus on the screen. If you're a heavy graffiti user, this is not the protector for you. Better suited to MP3 players and button pushing only."
3,ok,"kinda hard to get on with nothing getting in the way (hair, dust, ect.) but it keeps my screen looking good :D"
4,"As good as any, better than most","Let's face it - most screen protectors are lousy. They say they're reusable, but they're not - by the time they wear, you want to throw them away anyway. They start to peel and curl. They're not perfectly transparent, they cause just enough distortion to be noticeable. They're hard to line up, hard to lay down without lots of bubbles. This type took 2 tries, but looks very good, no bubbles, no dust, easy applicator. I don't reuse them, replace them about every 8 months, that's why you get a 3-pack. Then you'll be getting a new PDA anyway, with a different screen size."
3,Great Rossini; mediocre Verdi,"The Rossini Stabat Mater is fantastic on this recording, with Pilar Lorengar on Soprano and Josef Greindl on Bass.The Verdi is only fair, but buy this for the Rossini.Germanic Latin alert--you will hear ""kvi"" for qui and hard ""g""s. ""Crutzifixi."""
5,My favorite book,"I've read about ten photography books and this one is my favorite. The text is simple, yet essential. The photographs are truly great.I guess if someone has read ""Nature Photography Field Guide"" will find many things at least familiar. The photos, although great to my eye, might be found as too conventional. But thats OK with me.I think John Shaw is the best ""tutor"" I could find. His books have helped me a lot to improve my photography."
5,Invaluable and friendly,"Ususlly I have difficulties with teach-books, as they make me sleep. This one keeps me awake reading until late night. Invaluable advice and encouragement for self-confidence are given in a friendly, down-to-earth way, with humor and style. Excellent."
5,A great way to spend $20,"If you want to learn as much as possible without laying out long green for a class or hardback textbook, pick up Shaw's volume. Your photography will improve more using Shaw's techiques than with a fancy, new lens (a lot cheaper at least!). John's language is very clear; never intidimating nor dumbed-down. Many nice high-quality photographs alongside text."
5,Excellent text,THis book takes the mystery out of landscape photography. The techinal aspects are simply explained and illustrated in many cases which allows the artist at it were in you to be released. Very thoughtful and insightful a must for anyone interested in landscape and even travel photography.
3,pretty good,"This book is pretty good. All Tattoo books have some stuff you can use. Some are totally worthless, this is somewhere in between."
1,Wasn't what I thought it was,This wasn't what I thought I was getting. I sent it back. I wanted a book with ideas and pictures.
4,Insightful and down to earth.,I was a bit skeptical at a book with this type of format and approach but it was amazingly well done. It covered many of the questions I knew to ask and didn't know what the best answer was as well as the questions and answers I had yet to even consider. A very very useful guide to the entire process behind getting a tattoo and one I'd recommend to everyone who wants to feel fully informed before making such a permanent decision.
5,Great Information!,"I really enjoyed this book, I had already gotten my first tattoo but this provided alot of infromation and explaination that I craved. I am still looking for a good Kanji explaination book though....."
1,Amateurish,"This low budget video is not worthy of distribution by Amazon. It's an amateur video that looks like it was made by a group of New Age ""researchers"" who made it for themselves, and for sale at New Age and crop circle conventions. It is not a comprehensive or balanced inquiry into the phenomenon of crop circles, and even assumes a certain level of prior knowledge. The ultimate premise of the video is that crop circles are created by a ""cosmic"" connection between people thinking about shapes, the mysterious lights associated with crop circles, and the crop circles themselves.The Discovery Channel it ain't."
3,Durable but poor design,"My two boys (3 1/2 and 2) love this truck. They race garbage trucks around the park and house, and this truck has been extremely durable. The wheels are designed to go over rough uneven terrain. The main drawbacks to this truck are a couple of design flaws that frustrate the boys:1. When you try to attach the trash bin to the loader, the trash bin does not secure well and falls down. Also, when you try to dump trash from the trash bin to the opening in the top of the truck, the bin and trash fall down. My oldest son was so frustrated we detached the loader and threw it away.2. The back door doesn't open very wide. When the boys want to put things in the back, large items won't fit.Despite these design flaws that caused alot of frustration and tears at first, the truck has been raced all around the park (mud, sand, dirt, rocks, etc.) takes a beating, and has held up well."
3,Byzantium: An Illustrated History,"A good, quick overview of what is sometimes a grindingly confusing story (""byzantine""?). Lots ofpictures, however, which is very good because the Byzantines were such great artists."
5,collectors delight,"A fantastic package for those of us whom know little of this period other than the general run of hollywood films on offer.Plenty has already been said about these films, so i need not add to the wise comments already made. However i will say this box set stands head and shoulders above some of the other so called "" box sets "" out there.Nice to see someone has put some thought into it. Worth every cent !. Proud to own it."
5,gettysburg & gods and generals 150 anniversary edition review,I was absolutely delighted with this product - there is lots of cool stuff in with the box set which had me as an American Civil War fan in seventh heaven. The movies run very much better with (in Gods & Generals) the Battle of Antietam and the John Wilkes Booth plot being re-added - they are now complete and I was ecstatic to watch them. Gettysburg is much better also with the extra bits (about) 17 minutes back in as well. Absolutely Fabulous stuff!!! Buy now!!
5,Best Civil War Movies,I consider these two movies the best Civil War movies ever made! There was going to be a 3rd movie but I think money became an issue!No finer way to spend an snowy or rainy afternoon than watching one these movies. Can't wait to see it in bluRay.
5,Great Civil War movies!,"I am a Civil War buff so ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"" are two of my favorites movies. I wanted to get these movies in Blu-ray, so when I saw this collector's package, I jumped at it. The movies are great, but the package as a whole isn't too much to brag about: Nice packaging with limited edition serial number, a few extra booklets, and a lot of advertising. Still a nice part of my meager Civil War collection, though."
1,don't waste your time or money,"what a waste of time!!!! i looked forward to watching this on the history channel, but was very, very disappointed!!this is not worth your time or money!!"
5,Movies are a 5. WB marketing deserves a 1,"Ok, first of all I love both of these movies. I am especially interested in seeing the Extended Director's Cut of Gods and Generals because of the additional hour of footage and a completely reedited movie. My problem, I don't currently have Blu Ray so I would be forced to pay $50 to buy this package just to obtain a copy of Gods and Generals Extended Cut on DVD. I have already purchased Gettysburg twice since it came out. Once in VHS and another copy when it came out on DVD. From my research, the Gettysburg Extended Director's Cut only adds 17 minutes of additional footage and doesn't really add much to the original version. So I don't want to buy it again. I am disappointed with Warner Bros. marketing decision to not release these movies on DVD separately like they did with Blu Ray. So 5 stars for the movies and 1 star to WB marketing."
4,Great set for the price,"I bought this as an Amazon Gold Box deal and am extremely happy that I did. I'm a big fan of movies with big battle scenes and both of these movies fit the bill. I find Gettysburg to be an excellent movie - spectacular scenery, costumes, and battles. There are a number of tepid reviews out there for Gods and Generals, and while it's not as good as Gettysburg, I do admire it for the same reasons I liked Gettysburg. The Collector's Edition provides some nice extras in an attractive package, and goes nicely with my other Collector's Edition sets. If you can get it as a GB deal, I highly recommend it."
1,Wouldn't Bother!,I watched this when it was broadcast on The History Channel. I wouldn't bother with the DVD if it were free. A waste of time; boring and misleading.
1,More Pointless Noise....,"I always give a band two chances to prove their worth and I have to admit I wasn't at all looking forward to hearing another album by this band after their absolutely awful debut. To put it plainly, this is sheer pointless nonsensical pre-adolescent racket. Its all been done before and Internal Bleeding again prove how unoriginal they are as well as exhibiting their total inability to write coherently structured songs. They blast away mindlessly as before and deliver a vocal performance that is so bad its beyond laughable. Another band bites the dust...."
1,WORST DEATH METAL BAND EVER,"IB are one of the worst ""death metal"" bands ever. This band should have gone away a long time ago, but for some horrible reason they still play their awful brand of ""moshy"", wimpy ""groove"" oriented ""death metal"". If you want to hear DEATH METAL, go and listen to bands like old GRAVE, MASSACRE, AUTOPSY, old MORBID ANGEL, etc. Not this garbage, Suffocation clone crap."
5,This Rules!!!,"This cd is godly!!! This and 'voracious contempt' was and will always be IB. Everything they put out after this was garbage, especially their new recycled heap of trash ep. This cd was and still is great. They got a little too much w/the heavy bass parts though. Frank Rini's vocals are the best the band ever had and some of the deep parts he hits are so amazing! He also holds out the longest growls ever. He sings w/such hate and viciousness on this-it scares me. I used to see them live during '94-'97 and they were the best then. Bring back Frank please!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Review of Beyond Race and Gender,"I was extremely pleased with all aspects of the transaction. The product was exactly what I was looking for, it was in excellent condition, it was at a great price, and the delivery was fast."
3,No Solutions,"Pretty good overall. Only a very high level overview, that doesn't really go ""Beyond Race and Gender."" All talk and no solutions. I don't think Roosevelt bases his conclusions on sound statistics, either."
1,wrong information was given about this product,"This adapter was supposed to charge ww600i as listed , but it did not even fit it . Its totally false information being given for this item ..will never purpchase it from this merchant ever ..cant belive Amazon has these untrustworthy merchants"
1,Worth Less Than Nothing,"For anyone who has any basic familiarity with using a computer (viz. using EXPLORE to navigate the file system and some program to defragment the drive and determining how much disk space you have available) this book is useless. It really doesn't present anything other than designing a disc label that you won't get with the instruction manuals with the hardware/software you buy for burning a CD or DVD. It's ""worth less than nothing"" because it costs time and postage to return the book. But, I'd say it's better than ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Creating CDs and DVDs""."
1,CD & DVD recording - 2ed,"For someone who is a real novice I suspect that there is a lack of basic information to get that person started. For someone who is a step above a novice the book (latest edition) is already badly out of date and still doesn't cover popular software written years before the publication data (e.g., Pinnacle Clean). It does not cover any of the problems one encounters with music recording. It simply tells you how to transfer files from your computer to a CD or DVD and because that is simply a matter of clicking on buttons for software included on most computers it doesn't help."
4,CD and DVD Recording for Dummies,"I purchased the book in order to help with a presentation I was doing to my not so computer literate co-workers. I found the book helpful in assisting me to put certain focal items in lay person's terms, and some additional information to help keep my presentation interesting. I am glad I purchased it. Warning, if you are a computer guru, stay clear, not for the advanced at heart."
2,a bit dated...,"At the time this book was probably decent...but now, it's irrelevant. Free software available on the net will allow you to do everything in this book. However, the material in the book is presented and written well; it's just useful for those who don't want to find freeware. 2-stars only..."
2,"Ok if you use Roxio, I don't!","This book goes into great detail but only if you use Roxio. I don't and the book doesn't really go into detail about how to use the information with any other software. Pretty much useless in my case. I gave it two stars because I did learn a little by looking through it. Not enough, however, to make it worth the purchase."
2,"Too harsh, didn't work for my dog!","I gave this 2 stars because although this DOES make the dog stop pulling, my 3 yr. old beagle just couldn't get used to it. He literally made himself bleed on walks around the yard trying to pull it off with his paws. He got himself so worked up that I had a hard time getting him to settle down just to get it off of him. My husband tried it with him also and it just seemed inhumane to us. Our Jack Russell hated it also but I do think she could get used to it. I guess it would probably work better with puppies. I'll be selling them at my next garage sale or on amazon!"
4,Powerful stories from another world,"I first came across this book while reading Francine Prose's ""Reading Like a Writer."" She provided a short excerpt from ""A Distant Episode"" and I was intrigued.That particular story - the first in this collection selected by Bowles - was perhaps the most arresting, but they were all interesting. Each story quickly draws you into an exotic world with characters and settings that are palpable.Perhaps I was most taken in by how different each of the stories seemed to be. From a horrifying, violent descent into obscurity and insanity to a simple collection of letters by a single author. From compact, intense stories to a meandering walk through the life of an older, single woman in a foreign place.These images have stayed with me long after I put the book down."
5,Obese and Losing Weight thanks to this Tape!,"I was 55 lbs. overweight. I tried everything and failed at everything, until now! I have gotten so much confidence from these DVDs! The meter on the bottom of the screen is such an inspiring push that I needed. Leslie Sansone is a wonderful, energetic, but not annoying type instructor. I lost 10lbs. already and I have only used the 1 mile DVD for 3 weeks. I do it 5 days a week and do not eat anything after 8pm. I have more energy! I am so happy! I am starting to use the 2 mile DVD next week! Just by doing the exercise video it keeps me going all day not only with energy but with willpower to not want to eat things I usually did! Thank you Leslie Sansone for all your Wonderful Workout tapes!"
5,You can't miss with this set!,"This is a great program! You can do either 1,2, or 3 mile walking workouts, depending on how much time you have or how fit you are.I live in Montana, and it is either just too darn cold and nasty out (or not safe because of icy streets/sidewalks) to do outside brisk walking for at least 3 months in the Winter. With these workouts, I can fit in a brisk workout whenever I want. The 1 mile walk can be done while dinner is cooking, and at least gives me a brief workout whereas I might have otherwise not done anything at all that day.I also enjoy Leslie's chatter and enthusiasm and it feels that you are in the class with her and the other people, rather than just by yourself. I also do Yoga, and occasionally go to the gym with my husband, but this is a great compliment to other exercise programs, and is certainly sufficient all on it's own as well."
5,Excellent for beginners!!,"I love this 2 DVD set! I'm a college student and have an odd schedule and little space in my dorm. These videos have really helped me to get off my butt and exercise. The first dvd is so wonderful and gets you started without strain. They are both very low impact and refreshing! I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to get fit, and especially people like me who has two left feet. :)"
4,Good walking workout but bring your own weights,"I was really happy to find Leslie on DVD. The programs are good quality and the steps are simple. Leslie seems down-to-earth and motivating. She also has participants in the workout using no weights or limited range movements with weights. The workouts fly by and I love the on screen ""mile marker"" that lets you know how much time you have left. Leslie includes warm up, cool down and a very light stretc... When I called the number on the flyer I got clueless people on the other end and a big run around. They wouldn't honor the deal so I bought some 3 pound weights locally. This did put a bad taste in my mouth, but Leslie's program is quality."
4,Let's get this party started.,"I haven't actually done the workout yet, but I did put it in my DVD player to get a sense of what it was about. From what I saw, I think I'm going to love this workout tape. It's great for those of us who are uncoordinated and lazy. If you can walk, you can do this workout. The people on the tape are very friendly and you can just sense it.If you can lift your legs and lift your arms and walk, but are lazy like me, then this is the tape for you."
5,No Excuses,"I love the 3 pack workout set. With such a busy schedule, there is a choice of which workout to do based on how much time you have. Need a quick pick me up, the 1 mile is only 18 minutes. That's easy to fit into any schedule. If you can go 18, 30 minutes isn't much more for the 2 mile. Well, the three mile is just a little longer but what a great feeling after you're done. Forty nine minutes of continuous movement and I didn't find I was watching the clock to see when it would be over. Great for all fitness levels-from couch potato to gym enthusiast."
2,Good for a rainy day or light workout,"I wasn't that impressed with this, even after reading others reviews BEFORE I bought it.It is good if you can't get out to walk or if you just want a LIGHT workout or if you are a beginner. I walk every day and alternate days doing step aerobics and I just didn't feel like I did anything after doing these videos. I guess my own personal walks are just more intense than these videos.I will probably enjoy these IN ADDITION to my own workouts to have multiple workouts in a day, but just to do these is not enough for my personal taste."
5,Great,"This is a really nice video, fun, motivational, and energetic work out tape. I would definitely recommend this video to others."
4,I enjoyed this DVD,This is a great workout if you are not looking for anything too intense. The miles go by really quickly. This workout is perfect for mid-range exersion levels. They use special water ball weights in the video but I substituted my own handweights without a problem. This is a perfect addition to your collection for mixing things up with a little lighter workout.
4,Great to get you started,"I had a baby and subsequently (18 months later!)had lost motivation to exercise - however, after cruising amazon and reading lots of good reviews about the lesley sansone Walk the pounds Away series I decided to buy it and give it a go - and I can say that it is the best thing I have done in ages. The steps are really basic and easy to follow - no fancy dance moves, and while the course is not especially challenging, if like me you have done very little exercise for a while, it is a fantastic starting point. It is motivating too because it is achievable - you can get through a whole workout without getting lost or too tired. Moreover, as you progress you can make the workout more challenging by modifying the steps and adding some weights. I am rarely motivated to write reviews, but this series is really working for me. However - don't get too excited about ordering the ball weights if you live overseas!..."
5,WoW *WoW* WoW*,"I just did my 1 MILE for the first time!!! Just got this DVD tonight. This is soo super...I was rear ended by a bus many years ago and cannot freely move my arms when walking due to the serious muscle spasm it causes in spinal area and neck and a knee injury this past fall. I did this whole ""1 mile"" and love it. I enjoyed the easy to follow moves also. I am glowing."
5,Walking Away The Pounds IS actually FUN,"I have been using Leslie Sansome's exercise tape for a bout 6 months in a gym. I have decided to incorporate it into my home life. You will get out of it, as for any exercise regimine, what you put into it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED~eNJoY"
4,"Good, basic workout","This is a good, solid workout and very basic for those who don't desire choreographed moves. It does the job of walking away the pounds. A good dvd to get started on an exercise routine.The only annoying factor is Ms. Sansone who does not stop talking. I have taken to pushing the mute button and just following the workout visually. I have my own favorite music playing the background. I would not let this dissuade anyone from trying the dvd. However, I will recommend to Ms. Sansone that the next time she creates one of these workouts, to please refrain from so much yakking."
2,my knees will never be the sam,"This is actually a great video, but the side steps KILLED my knees. I will always have trouble with my knees due to a condition caused by being a fat kid (side note to parents of ""chubby kids"" feeding them cookies are NOT helping them now and they'll pay for it later in life... I WAS a chubby kid and it's been proven that it's what is cause my present health problems at 36!!), but the pain was minimal prior to this video. Now I spend more time in my knee wrap than I ever did."
3,I was looking for more,"I was looking for something that would require more energy but even the 3 mile walk did not get me there. It just was pretty boring for this 60 year old woman. I am trying to find something like what the Michelle Dozois ""Walk your way slim"" requires."
5,Fun and Easy,Great dvd. Just started the 1 mile & love it! I already have more energy! Can't wait to start the 2 mile!
5,The Best of the best,This cd is the best of the best. i was soooooooooo upset when s club split up and i'm so glad that Rachel's go her own solo career. she was my favorite!!!!!!!!!!!!11
5,Wonderful litte book.,"I love to collect houseplants, and have for the last 5 years or so now. This is a cute little book that gave me a few pointers on how to better incorporate my houseplants into my home's decor as focal points, rather than accessories. I noticed a few typos in the book, but overall this book is very well laid out. It has excellent flow, and relays information mostly through photographs with little descriptive and to-the-point blurbs.It isn't a very in depth book as far as plant care is concerned, but it does give some basic information to get you started. All in all a decent book for my collection."
2,Poor Packaging. Came Broken,"I am a big believer in a man shinning his own shoes, so I was excited for this purchase. But when it came in the mail it was broke in three different places. From looking at the product it was clear that it broke for two reasons: 1) horrible packaging and 2) poor construction.I can excuse the first, but the latter just led me to return it for good."
1,Too few pieces,This tinkertoy set was pitifully lacking in the number of pieces. You could not build anything with it. The parts were difficult to put together too. Luckily I bought it at a severely discounted price and bought three. Buy the kids version.
4,Seems to be pretty good,"I reluctantly bought this based on the reviews I read. I wasnt sure how sturdy it would be. I am happy to report it works great for me. It is a bit flimsy, so thats why it only gets 4 stars. I was able to run 2 cat6 cables, 2 hdmi, 1 coax, and a small power cord through it with no problem. I wasnt sure how the HDMI would do since its a thicker cable, but it made a couple wraps around."
4,Sweet and simple,I've been looking around for a simple cable management for a while now. I took a chance with this one and I'm glad I did. It was real simple to use. I was just using twisty ties on them but I needed to conceal it.I separated all the wires and worked with one wire at a time. Got all the slack out of the wires. Its nice that you can wrap them any way you can to pull the slack out. Once all the wires were in there. I simply put zip ties to to hold them all together. Finished it looks really good.I'm a Gamer and a pc enthusiast so I have a lot of stuff on my desk with a whole lot of wires. This works perfectly.The quality is alright. The plastic feels light and flimsy. No big worry since my desk sits against a wall and nothing is going to hit it in fear of cracking the cover. The tabs you wrap the wires on could be stiffer with tabs sticking out a little further to hold wires on so they don't slide off. Other then that I'm happy with it. Its cheap and simple.
2,I'm not overly pleased with this product,"This product is very average. It is difficult to figure out the right length of cord to wrap so that the cord can reach the outlet and also the computer or other electrical device. By the time I had all my cords in it, the lid wouldn't fit on and some cords are too tight and the organizer won't sit on the floor. It also is not very durable -- it is just made of cheap plastic. It did help with my cord clutter but I think there is probably a better system out there."
4,Good product but it is no miracle worker.,I was looking for a product that would do a better job of concealing my rats nest of wires created by my dual monitor set up in my office. It has concealed the bulk of the wires but it is a little flimsy and I had some difficulty snapping the cover on because the base got a little twisted with the weight of the wires. I would definitely recommend but depending on the amount of wires you want to hide you may have some troubles.
5,The Dream,"This book is an excellent teaching source for young students to learn about Martin Luther King's dream and how it inspired a nation to change. I have used this book to teach civil rights, comparison/contrast, and voice using Six Traits."
2,Heavily Produced and Orchestrated,"Don't expect pure, simple arrangements with just the four of them and their instruments. Some of the orchestrations are as corny as they come. Reminds me of the Lawrence Welk Show. Lots of horn and other orchestral instruments provide background and the four are often backed up by a chorus."
1,"Weavers si, Gordon Jenkins no.","I can't stand The Weavers with orchestration. Even though they became famous with Gordon Jenkins and his orchestra, most of the songs can be found elsewhere without his being part of the process. There are a couple of songs I had not heard before, but with orchestra I will do without. The purist in me."
5,Fantastic breed of Brazilian-Electro-Funk. A Must!,"I wasn't sure how they could top the City of God soundtrack, which I think is the best soundtrack released in 2003;well-they did it, with this amazing party-starter that had me asking for ""more more MORE!"" This must goes right along with the Brazilian Trance craze and copaiera dance phenomenon currently taking over the dancing world. I got hooked on this Cd instantly. And my desire for more was met with yet another Volume of City of God Remixed. Check out Vol. 2 as well."
1,POO ON REMIX SOUND TRACT,This sound tract remix was a boring redundent waste of my time. I should of read other reviews before I purchased it. It's a total waste of $$$.
1,Avoid the REMIX version,"I saw the movie and was going to get the original soundtrack, which sounded great on the DVD. Other reviews indicated that the remix version was much superior, so I bought that version. What a mistake! The remix uses a bunch of dime-store, tinny-sounding effects that just ruin the sound in my opinion. In disgust, I gave up listening after hearing about 6 cuts. Unless you're into a heavily disco-ized sound and special effects, I'd avoid the remix version like the plague."
3,expecting something different,"i bought this cd hoping to hear some brazilian funky fighting music, but it's all electro-drum and bass type stuff. good music for chillin' out or makin' luv to tho."
4,A gripping version of this tale.,"Tampering with a story isn't always a good idea, but here the new twists are inspired, work well and will probably be refreshing to anyone who has seen umpteen re-makes of what is arguably Doyle's best Holmes tale (I especially liked the anti-foxhunting message at the beginning). Cushing is a first-class Holmes, his subtle shifts in moods giving great depth to the character. The supporting cast are generally strong, the moors are atmospheric and the soundtrack is appropriately creepy. The film does have a few problems - Stapleton's voice is often very badly dubbed, and his daughter Cecile has a very strange-sounding accent for no apparent reason. And there is a moment in which Holmes knocks away a furry thing which looks nothing like the tarantula it's supposed to be. But the film is so well-made and gripping that these minor faults can be overlooked."
2,disappointing,After a tremendous prologue this film falls apart. Doyle's classic has been rearranged so much it almost seems like another story. Only the bones of the classic are left.
2,Needless Tampering with Script Mars Movie,"Absurb tampering with a superb tale mars what is one of the best detective novels ever written. Unless you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, you'll want to skip this version. The best version si Basil Rathbone's 1939 version, if you can get over the fact that it's in black and white. Otherwise, Jeremy Brett's version is for you."
1,Well done flick,"This version of Holmes and Watson is more true to the books, in that Holmes can be very arrogant at times, and is in constant motion. I also enjoyed the interview with Mr. Lee; it was a nice inside view of his relationship with Cushing."
4,Great Hound,"Terrence Fisher directed many great Hammer Films, and this is one of his best. Cushing is a great Holmes and this version of the story is very well paced. Christopher Lee gets to play a romantic lead for once, and he is very good. I own several versions of this story, and this is my favorite."
5,One of Fisher's Best,"One of Terence Fisher's best films, in an immaculate transfer to DVD. Buy immediately; this is one the best Holmes films, and one of the finest films that Hammer ever made. Superb performances, excellent set design (Bernard Robinson), excellent score (James Bernard), excellent performances (Chris Lee, Peter Cushing, Andre Morrell). Buy this; you won't be sorry! Simply a must have!"
4,A Very Good DVD!,"I typically like the films from the Hammer Production. The 1959 version of The Hound of the Baskervilles is one of my favourite. Christoher Lee, whom I like very much, is simply superb in this film. Peter Cushing and Andre Morell are also excellent. The setting, the atmosphere and the whole feeling of the story are beautifully rendered. I highly recommand this DVD to others. For those who like this genre of films, it is a good one to add to one's collection."
3,"Good acting, but disappointing plot","Let me first say that I have read the Arthur Conan Doyle novel and the story is fantastic. It is often considered the best detective novel, certainly from Doyle, and for the rest of the literary world. I watched this version in high hopes that Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee would do well. They did not disappoint. However, the story left me baffled. There were plot changes from the original story, some so off from the novel that it made me cringe. The part with the tarantula was outrageously bad. Never happened in the novel. The characters were all mixed up in their roles. I was very disappointed and perplexed. Why does Hollywood take great works of literature and stain them into this garbage? The movie wasn't a total loss, but the negatives greatly outweigh the positives. I would not recommend this to any teacher for viewing in class because it strays too far away from the novel's plot and characterization. To the passing viewer, enjoy."
2,Hammer hammers Holmes,"It's not surprising Hammer would turn Conan Doyle's famous novel into an unsubtle and often vulgar film that exaggerates the implicitly horrific elements of the story and adds ""shocking"" events not in the original. The garish color is understandable given the state of color-negative materials a half-century ago, but that doesn't keep it from looking inappropriate. This is a treatment aimed at the usual market for Hammer films.Peter Cushing wasn't necessarily a bad choice to play Holmes, but he resembles an aging Danny Kaye (his hair should have been dyed black), and delivers a performance largely devoid of restraint. He's imperious but rarely witty, loud when he should be subtly threatening. Most of the film has a ""perfunctory"" quality, as if it had been shot in two or three weeks.That this film has been generally well-received by critics shows they haven't read the original."
4,Well done and worthwhile horror/mystery drama.,"Sunday, March 06, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Well done and worthwhile horror/mystery drama.Excellent Hammer rendition of the Sherlock Holmes story. It was a bit weird seeing Peter Cushing as Holmes after his stint as Van Helsing and Dr. Frankenstein. I still think Basil Rathbone was the definitive, but Cushing held his own. Even odder was the presence of Lee as the `doomed' heir to the Baskerville fortunes. Seeing Lee try to play anything but a heavy, or the Count for that matter was a stretch. Even when attempting a smile, it comes off as a malevolent smirk with the hint of physical violence to follow. At any rate, the colors are vibrant and the moors are given decent treatment as Holmes and Watson must `guard' Lee from succumbing to the old legend that the Baskervilles are cursed for a blood crime of their 17th century predecessor. Worthwhile horror/mystery drama."
4,A POW's factual review of 4 years in a Japanese prison,"This is a book written by my uncle Ben Waldron. His experiences from the age of 18 to over 22 years old while being a prisoner in a Japanese prison camp is factual in detail from a diary he secretly kept for 4 years. This is a piece of history that the young people of the US should learn from. After reading, his account of treatment as a POW for 4 years nothing can compare to POW's sacrifice as a soldier for his country. What is happening in the world today is tragic but it hasn't continued for four years. What kept these men going and surviving unbelievable treatment should be studied by our Military. What price freedom is explained in this book. Our county owes those men who died and lived through this chapter in our history the price of freedom we enjoy today. As a parent this book is required reading for your son, the experience of what others went through for us."
3,Useful roadmap to Avedon's work,"I'm glad that I own this book but potential buyers should be aware that this is a history of Avedon's work, not a stunning presentation of his photographs. The book contains hundreds of images but most of them are small in size. The images are arranged chronologically with some associated text. The book also contains two essays about Avedon and a detailed bibliography listing press accounts about him. There is also a helpful list of the various books that Avedon has published.I would recommend his other titles -- ""In the American West"" for example -- if you want to see the full-size, stunning photographs for which Avedon is famous."
3,"Not bad, but not so good as I expected",The book is OK. Nevertheless beware: there is more text than photographs. And they are tiny in most cases. He who prefers to read about photographs rather than to see them will be pleased. I am a little disappointed.
1,Not worth buying,"I never write reviews because I recognize that one person's junk is another's gem. This book was so bad, though, that I just had to write a review this time. I agree with jimmieb. This book was poorly written with little worth reading. I could probably reduce the book to 10 pages (probably less, I'm trying to be generous) of worthwhile advice. Much of the writing was quoted from other psychologists and authors or from their previous books with very little original thought. Having finished the book this morning, I can only remember one of the ""7 Best Things"". This book is going in the trash and that's the ultimate insult from this bibliophile."
2,A little okay advice overshadowed by bad writing,"I'm not much of a reader of self-help books. This may actually be my first. I was browsing all the nether-regions of Borders, and it was featured in the self-help section. I thought it couldn't hurt to know the ""secrets."" I didn't expect to find stellar writing, but this seemed particularly bad. It's poorly organized, jumping from topic to topic, tangent to tangent, and often not tying any of it together. While some of the advice is insightful, the writing is bad enough to be distracting. The authors go to the trouble of making up dialogue to illustrate examples, but it is melodramatic and sounds like nothing anyone would actually say. Every positive example seems to end with people crying and being overcome with a feeling of great warmth. I felt like the amount of actual wisdom in this book could be condensed into a magazine article."
1,Wordy and Boring,"Just too much blah blah blah to even bother reading it. Maybe it's because I had just gotten done reading another marriage book that I REALLY liked. This book kind of gets to the meat of things and is more realistic. Anyway, if anyone is interested the book I like alot is ""The 30 Secrets of Happily Married Couples"" by Paul Coleman. Short chapters, easy read but full of great info and ideas. At the end of the chapter tells you ideas not to do and ideas to do."
3,Not within ECM standards,"I am a huge fan of Oregon, I love the old recordings before ECM. This one, I'm afraid, is not Oregon at its best. I find Manfred Eicher's insightful guidance missing here. The sound is good, but it is not enough for me. There is no sense of exploration, of discovery or magic. Just a little matter of fact. Sorry. Just an opinion, but I would get Out of the woods or Crossing for a good Oregon recording."
4,Must have,"If you do a lot of grilling this is a tool that is needed. It get between the grates to get then nice a clean. It best when the grill if nice and hot, right before you put you food on. I still use a square on to get the top clean, but for in between a grate this works best."
3,Okay but.........,The brush works okay but my wife feels that the one at HD or Lowes works just as well and at a slightly lower price.
5,Rock and Roll History,"Well, I was in high school and in Northern California when A Guy Called Gerald released ""Voodoo Ray"" and that one didin't make it to us. Man. But, New Order did as well as a general idea that punk had evolved in a few certain ways in a few certain places. That particular ""Manchester a la Detroit"" evolution turned out to be dance music. Well. When this finnally, in the very early ninties made its full imapct felt in our neck of the woods....there was NO TURNING BACK. NO. THERE WAS NO GOING BACK. My poor saxophone tutor. Incedently if you email me I would be happy to point you towards my album. www.garageband.com/artist/bioutopiaOh..yes the CD. Music history and nothing less."
1,Killers in cold blood,Don't let the title fool you - you think you are orderingtrue crime but the package arrived holding 3 DVDs about snakes.This set should be listed under nature!
1,Beware the size is wrong,"I liked the pillows but they are 12 inchs square not 18 inches ( as shown )-For the price I had to send ""em back"
3,"Not bad, quality of recording fair","This concert by Al Stewart and his band is about 45 minutes in length. The quality of the recording is not so great, but considering it was filmed in 1979 in a TV studio, it's fair. It's great to see Al in concert again, especially ""vintage Al""...the hair and clothes are a bit of a laugh... as well as the audience members. True 1970's styles. This is sure to be a collector's item in the future, so it's worth it."
3,SWEATIN' TO THE OLDIES REVIEW,"I'M SURE THIS IS A VERY GOOD SET, HOWEVER, THE ORIGINAL ""SWEATIN'TO THE OLDIES"" IS NOT INCLUDED. I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IS WAS NOT PART OF THIS SET. I DID NOT FIND THIS OUT UNTIL I RECEIVED MY ORDER. IT WAS NOT DESCRIBED WELL ON THE AMAZON WEBSITE."
4,A good workout,"I've tried several different workout videos and ended up back at these. They are pretty corny, but I like that they portray regular people exercising, not just perfect bodies. The dances, though hard to learn at times, are fun and interesting. There is a good mix of stretching, aerobic, and strengthening exercise. The clothing and hairstyles drive me crazy, but all in all it's the best I've found so far."
3,SWEATIN TO THE OLDIES DVD SET,Very disappointed that the first original Sweatin'to the Oldies was replaced by a different DVD -Sweat and Shout.Title of set is not accurate.
3,not exactly as pictured,"While the weather station is nice, and the recipient of the gift is pleased, we wanted the one as shown in the picture. It was supposed to have the humidity dial on the bottom. The weather station sent did not have the humidity dial even thou the model number is the same TH-6SS and the photo shows it to be there. Luckily for Amazon we were too busy to attempt an exchange or follow up."
2,Didn't work out of the box,It wasn't calibrated when it came so I attempted to do it via the instructions included. It was difficult to get the glass off the front and I ended up cracking it. I didn't feel like dealing with it so I sent it back. The product looked sturdy and I was excited when I first put it up...until I realized it wasn't reading the right temperature and I had to try to calibrate it.
3,Hawkwind - 'Masters Of The Universe' (Simply The Best),"Wasn't this the title that was first released on the EMI label?I'm pretty sure it was.Either way,'Masters...' is merely ANOTHER disc for all us Hawkwind completists.Total of six tunes.For any newcomers that may be reading this,there are two cuts,""Master Of The Universe"" and ""Brainstorm"" from their 'actual' lp's of which they first appeared.Two tracks from their famed 'Space Ritual' live reissue,""Orgone Accumultor"" and ""Sonic Attack"" and two more tunes,a B-side ""It's So Easy"" and ""Lost Johnny"" from their 'Hall Of The Mountain Grill' lp.Great cover,don't you think?"
1,From the loft,"I bought this vinal in 1980 and enjoyed the first four tracks. The first two tracks go together well (works on an Lp, but not on a CD), the next two do not fit with the first two (the last two tracks are rubbish). I left it in my parents loft (with the rest of my Lps) in 1986 and had not listened to it until 2005. I now feel that the whole album is rubbish."
5,Best I've ever used.,"These cables, and the KVM they attach to, are the best I've ever used. What else can I say? Definitely a staple brand in my business."
1,The one bad Xanth novel,"I'll read any Xanth book, almost any time, except this one. Goblins and Alicentaurs are some of the least interesting characters in the series. I have all sympathy for the real Jenny, but Jenny Elf should hook up with Richard and Janet and live in quiet obscurity. But Dolph is what makes this book unreadable. His father and grandfather were tactical and social geniuses compared to this guy. I'm sincerely glad he's not first in line for the throne. (BTW, is Dor *ever* going to abdicate?) And quite fankly, I would have liked to see him bed Nada; he deserves one good **** before he goes to his bitter, loveless marriage with an otherwise winsome young (!) girl. But at least it sets up the best Xanth novel, Question Quest."
5,I enjoyed this book alot,"This book was one of the best books by Anthony I have read yet. The way he describes the scenes makes it so it seems that your there, witnesing the scene happening in front of you. It wasn't a complicated book, so it made it fun to read. The conflicts in the book, pulled you into it. I enjoy the puns Anthony used in this book alot. I would recomend the book to people from teens to middle- age. It was excellent."
1,"He runs a cult, so take this stuff with a grain of salt.","If you're interested in Sufism, Buddhism, Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, etc., do yourself a favor and read the real thing instead of this stuff. In this book and his other early works, he has repackaged the above systems and attempts to pass them off as his original ideas. That being said, his early books are a cut above his later material, which apparently is a bit more 'original'."
2,Works great....but only with light weight paper!,"This printer does not load paper properly if it is anything thicker than 6 mil. All of the nice Photo Papers that are a bit thicker and produce wonderful color, do not feed into the roller properly, and the top portions of the photos don't appear. The color is fantastic, but who cares if your missing part of the photo?You need a JetPrint Server for the tool box to work...(an additional $200 item)and the drivers are very poor. Standard paper feeds properly, but after spending $400 for one that can ""do it all"", I can't afford another for my photos!"
1,Can't feed anything except regular paper,"This printer would be great if we could use anything other than regular paper in it. It chokes on photo paper. It chokes on anything thicker than regular paper. You end up wasting as much paper and ink as you use on good prints. The rear feed is a joke. You can't even get regular paper to feed straight. Also, as with most inkjets, the ink costs are ridiculous. I'm buying a color laser (maybe QMS magicolor) and will order my photo prints online (it's cheaper and better)."
2,planned obsolescence?,"This printer prints beautifully, but unfortunately just a few weeks after the warranty ran out, it won't turn on anymore. From what I've heard this has happened to a lot of people who bought this model. So only buy it if you intend to throw it out in less than a year. Thanks a lot HP."
3,hp1220c deskjet,I find that it will not allow me to print 11 x 17 heavy photo stock paper. I do alot of arial photos and can not print unless I buy plan photo paper.Just not fair.
3,"Good color, but...","I've had my printer for about 2 years. This printer does make good color prints, but I wish I had purchased an Epson, because the HP will not handle heavy card stock well at all. Using the rear manual paper feeder can be a nighmare. As in one of the previous reviews, I also ended up throwing away as much paper as I used. In order to get 65 invitations printed, I used 125 pieces of paper. That was a big disappointment. I've owned an Epson in the past, which does handle heavier papers with ease and I intend to go back to them."
1,Disappointed,"Owning a photography business I needed a printer to print brochures, pamphlets and flyers that contained photos, on heavy card stock. During the first few months it did a good job but after that the heavy paper just wouldn't feed. As a result there was a massive waste of paper. Three months after the 1 year warranty expired the printer completly stopped working."
1,"18 Months Product - and then its bye, bye","Like other users on this website, I bought this product 18 months ago. It worked well for about 12 months. Then one day it couldn't handle 13x19 inch paper, any longer. A littler later it couldnt' handle 11x17 and by now I have problems even with letter size paper. The rollers don't feed the paper correctly, so that pictures and text is printed at an angle.Hewlett Packard acknowledges that this product has had this problem, but blames it on the paper that people use. I doubt this is the case, given that I have only used HP paper and paper with the same weight as HPs papers.Therefore don't buy this product. It's great for a while, but the quality of the rollers in the printer are so miserable that the printer doesn't last for very long.HP offered to replace it for $ 275 ! Now, who would do that ?"
4,Excellent Case,"These Slappa cases are the nicest cases I have used/seen. The stitched pockets are a very unique, high quality and well thought out design. They don't hold as many as other cases that are similar in size because of the pockets and hard case design but I am willing to sacrifice size for quality and functionality in this case. I ordered another Slappa case of the same size but different color in order to separate my jazz and rock CDs into 2 cases. The stated capacity (240 in this case) is only if you double stack your discs instead of using the front slot for the liner notes and place the disc behind it, which is what I do. In that case the capacity is obviously half the stated capacity. Comes with soft cleaning cloth. Highly recommended."
1,Ugh. . .,"I should've listened to Minister Dixon's review, but I had hopes that it couldn't be as bad as he was saying. . . but yeah, he's right. This movie is terrible! The first time I watched it, I fell asleep within a mere ten minutes. Then I tried to watch it again, but unfortunately, it was the same boring thing all the way through. Heed my warning -- save your forty-five cents and go buy another movie."
3,Not all that bad,"I admit that this is not a class A martial arts piece but I found it not be a real bad movie, I watch these films for fight content only. If you luck up on one that has a plot worth following then thats rare but the fight scenes here are not that bad remember the price sometimes that tells the story."
4,"Very nice, but...","All the knives look great, but I don't like the bread knife. It's too small. I don't have much to say for the quality, b/c I haven't started using it, but the weigh, and the looks are awesome. I'm sure anyone will like it as much as I do."
5,Wusthof Classic 6-Piece Cook's Cutlery Set,"Love this knife set, but had to return it. Received prompt and courteous refund. Would buy from this seller again."
2,It was a single,"Got this for my husband but I didn't realize it was a single, not really worth the price for a single song."
1,be careful - this may be a single song CD,"Please check this out carefully. All my net research shows that this is a Single-Song CD. If you are a fan of Italian pop, you know you need to be careful with this sort of thing or end up paying $12 to $15 for seven minutes of Music. Note to AMAZON: please post this review."
5,Hard to find this title...except at Amazon,"I had DVRed this movie from a satellite channel, but wanted a ""real"" copy for myself. I tried my usual resources like Family [...], but they did not have the movie. I finally found it at Amazon. Amazon has yet to fail me...."
5,Great war picture!!!!......Great DVD,"The title says it all. The Devil's Brigade is a great war to watch. The movie is based on a true story in WWII, where a unit of American soldiers and a crack unit of Canadian troops formed the 1st Special Service Force a.k.a. the first special forces group. This movie has great acting, great cinematography, great battle scenes, and great actors, like William Holden, Cliff Robertson, Vince Edwards, Richard Jaeckel, Claude Atkins, Andrew Prine, Richard Dawson, Robert Watson, and in some bit parts, Dana Andrews, Carrol O'Conner, and Michael Rennie. If you want to see a great war movie, give Devil's Brigade a try. I recemend it to WWII movie fans."
4,The Legacy of Special Forces,"I grew up in Montana, and have been to Ft. Benjamin Harison, just out side Helena, Montana. I have also been in the Army for 16 years and in Special Forces for 10 years. I feel that the film is a must see along with the Green Berets if you are in Special Forces. Ft Harison is the actual location where the OSS and Col. Arron Banks started their training, and looks very much like what is depicted in the movie."
4,A True-to-Type Historical Drama,"This movie pays tribute to an elite American/Canadian fighting force which made several key actions against the Germans. The plot is a chronicle of the formation and training of 'The Devil's Brigade'(a.k.a. the First Special Operations Division)and covers 2 of their first missions, but it is less a documentary than a dramatization of the characters and their commanding officer. It has a little blood & gore (a given in a war drama) but very little by today's standards. On the whole it is a very emotional, suspence-filled piece and is rightly considered one of the best war films of the time."
4,"""Brigade"" is a Good Movie","Here's the thing. This is a MOVIE. It is NOT an actual historical documentary. So consider that when viewing this fine movie. So just try to enjoy it for what it is and don't expect it to be something it is not.William Holden, Cliff Robertson, Claude Akins, and the rest of the cast really give inspired performances. They all come across as tough and proud and determined which is exactly what you expect from Special Forces soldiers.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the WW II genre and an action oriented movie. It is not Saving Private Ryan, but it is still good entertainment."
4,I was there...,"Not a great film, but an entertaining and exciting one. Reveals little know aspect of World War II. Being an extra in this film gave me the opportunity to talk with men who actually served in the ""Devil's Brigade"". They gave valuable assistance in contributing to the film's accuracy. After viewing the film, you may want to read about their further exploits that the film couldn't depict. There is a fine book of the same title that is, unfortunately, out of print. Check out your local library!"
1,Author was convicted of sexually and physically assaulting his son,"The author, a school psychologist, was recently convicted of numerous counts of sexual and physical abuse against his son. He sexually assaulted the victim between ages 10 and 18, when the victim finally ran away from home. Swank was sentenced in Victorville, California to life plus 96 years. Search his name for more information."
5,Excellent lighted magnifier,The Carson Optical Lighted Magnifold Magnifier is an extremely well designed product. The foldable handle and lights make reading easy.
4,Ambidextrous to a Point,"Before I ordered this I knew it was designed for right handed users so I am not complaining. But, it would have been nice if it had some ambidextrous features. Even so it still has a nice feel and balance to it. The lens is very clear with very little distortion. The light is bright and evenly distributed across the viewing area. A push button with a auto off light would be a nice future modification. The handle has four (including closed) locking positions. As a final not for lefties if you do not need the light you can flip it over and it works well for those of us who are left in this world. If you could just be able to re-direct the light. And a final note. The battery compartment is located in the handle and is secured with a plastic pressure lock and that shinny little thing on the battery compartment is a screw but you need a magnifying glass to see it. Overall a good product. A good buy.Just one after thought, a protective cover would be nice feature."
2,The power is too low,"I can see better without it, needs more magnification.If I could return it I would but the postage is 1/2 of it' value"
3,Great magnification; poor light,"I love the size and handling of this magnifier. When I'm reading a paperback, I can hold the item in one place for quite awhile, which helps my concentration. My problem has been with the light. It worked for about a week after I received it, then stopped. Assuming the batteries had died, I bought new ones. They did not work (and were well within the package expiration date). I will try one more new set of batteries (3 are required) then return the item if the light still doesn't work."
2,Not much of a magnifier.,"Well built, light is bright....too bright for my taste. Magnification is minimal if any in my work. I keep it for my spouse who uses it for minor needs."
4,Very Good Quality Product,"I Bought this for my Mom (Along with a Carson Fresnel lens) after her Eye Surgery.I Must Say I was Very Impressed with the Quality of this Product.She Likes it very Much and said it Helped her eye vision alot, She also Liked the Fact that the handle can Fold In (In case she wants) to travel with it in her handbag.Another Plus is the LED Light that comes built into it, suitable for use when in places like Dim Lit restaurants etc.Only thing that would have made it even better was if they included a Carrying case.I would recommend this Product very Highly.!!!"
5,best lighted mag for reading a book,I got this for my husband but I keep taking it since it is so great..would hate to be without this now...lights up a whole page and don't even have to wear my reading glasses
5,WELL MADE MAGNIFYING GLASS,"This is a nicely built, handy magnifying glass. Well worth the money. Folds up for easy storage. I use it all the time for reading newspapers. Great for those pesky packages and instructions that are printed in fonts that are impossible to read otherwise."
3,magnifier,"it is a nice product with the magnifier and light but it is a little heavy and big, not made to carry with you or in a purse."
4,Really works great,"This really works great. I'm a bookkeeper and sometimes reading client bank statements and receipts is almost impossible even with reading glasses. The size and rectangle shape make it a handy tool. Also, you rarely need the lighted feature, so not to worried about batteries running out."
3,eah - not cool to use for reading,"Doesn't serve my purpose, which is reading novels.It can't quite fit a full line of text, so you have to keep shifting it, which is annoying. Also, it's got some weight to it, which got old fast (and I'm young and healthy, I don't know how the 90 yr olds deal with it).But I am keeping it for other purposes, just not for reading books, like looking at the details in stones and fossils. The light feature is great for that too!"
3,Good magnifier with one major flaw,"This is a good, low magnification magnifier with a very strong LED light to illuminate your work or a written page. It is big enough to use easily and even give stereoscopic vision. The problem is that there are easily noticed optical flaws in the lens. The worst is above the handle on mine, and it distorts everything over about "" of the lens width. Given the low magnification of the lens, this should not be happening. Quality control was poor on this unit."
2,batteries BIG flaw,"shape of lens excellent. the fact that it uses 3 button batteries.... not so good. in the video review carson was up front about the batteries but i would much prefer batteries i could recharge-im almost afraid to use the light unless in an emergency. there is a similar product from INDEPENDENT LIVING AIDS, LLC (catalog i got from some 5x power reading glasses i bought here on Amazon)that uses one AAA size battery (can buy rechargeable AAA's and a recharger) BUT its $24. if you plan on using the light often the batteries could make the carson an expensive purchase."
2,No batteries,"I got this without the batteries that were to have been included, and without any documentation re: troubleshooting, warranty or how to change the batteries (surely they don't expect people who need a magnifying glass to unscrew that teeny, tiny screw? That''s just a bad joke).I had to return this to Amazon and have found a different one I just ordered. Too bad this one didn't work out, but if they don't care enough to make sure customers get what they need, I don't want to patronize them."
2,short battery life,short battery life and not as powerful as my smaller ones.I am very happy with the entire purchase as a whole.
3,Not as powerful as I thought it would be.,"It was alright. The led light worked. However, the lens itself wasn't as powerful as I thought it would be."
4,Lighted magnifier,"This arrived promptly and in excellent condition. It delivers what it claims. The magnifying is adequate and the light is helpful. It is a bit bulky and I need to make a sleeve for it because I'm afraid it will scratch, the lens being made of a hard plastic. With that in mind, I recommend it for home use."
3,BEST ITEM I COULD FIND FOR THE PRICE BUT,I WISHED IT MAGNIFY AT LEAST 3X INSTEAD OF JUST 2X...AS I PURCHASED IT FOR VERY SMALL PRINT WHICH IT DOESA SO SO JOB ON...
3,Only ok.,"It wasn't as strong as my mom needed. She has another one that is much stronger. I thought the style of this one was useful, bu t it doesn't work as well."
4,Arms too short,Mother-in-law had eye surgery and needed assistance reading. Bought this after reviewing several products for reading assistance. She claims it is very helpful. Also has other applications.
1,Magnifier Light,"The Carson Optical Lighted Magnifold Magnifier was given as a gift to my 86-year old mother. She'd tried other products similar to this with dismal results. So far, she thinks this one is great. Perfect light intensity, magnifier shape, weight and ease of carrying.Carson Optical Lighted Magnifold Magnifier"
3,As advertised,The magnifier is not anything different than what it claims to be it is just that the magnification is so low it is really not all that great.
5,good product,worked as good as i thought it was and i loved the light and size. Made of good material too
3,Overly predictable,I was looking forward to reading this book but it quickly became predictable. I was hoping for so much more.
5,loved it,it was a very good read and an all around great series definitely recommend it to readers of all ages
4,"""Cirque du Freak"" Review","I really liked this book because of the vampires. I like creacures and monsters like that. It also had a good storyline. The book had very good description.The worse part was how the book took too much out of a little thing. It would drag out things that was'nt important.It did'nt stick to the story as much as it should have.The book had many good story elements. I liked the conflict, a boy turnrd into a vampire who couldn't get human friends. The resolution was they entered a travaling freak show. It had many people like him to befriend."
5,a great book,if you like the harry books you will love cirque du freak! it's a heart racing novel of a boy who is a half vampire and is learning how to deal with his changes.if you want to get your blood pounding i urge you to read this book you will not be sorry.
4,Review,"The haunting sequel to the Cirque du Freak, Darren Shan is back! If you liked the first book, Cirque Du Freak, you are sure to like this one although it is much more gruesome and definitely a thriller. In this book,the reader is swept into the actual circus where it all began, when Darren Shan becomes part of the Freak Show. You get to meet the freaks in person in The Vampire's Assistant and read about Darren's struggle to remain true to his human heritage even if it means sacrificing himself along with it..."
5,A really good book series,I first watched the movie and liking it so much I decided to give the books a try and quickly found out that the books are way better than the movie. The books are very easy to read and have to me a fantastic storyline. The wonderful arrangement of characters also make the series interesting to read.
3,Alright Book,This book was pretty good. It has a lot of weird characters in it. I think this book is geared towards teenagers and not adults since you have to have a pretty good imagination to like this book.
3,Cirque Du Freak - A Living Nightmare,"Albeit - this book was a very interesting read. Quite off the path of certain genres I persue. But delightful, altogether. The story hooks you quite well, willing you to read on. I myself finished it in a day. While as it supposedly fit into the horror genre, I didn't quite receive the shocking excitement I expected, or otherwise preferred. I didn't expect it to be recommended for such young ages, but still albeit, a fine read. I would reccomend it to a risk-taker; but mature enough to understand the .. strange .. concept. -Dee W. Age 12"
2,Was Not In Impressed,"After getting to chapter 19 I couldn't help but ask myself, Where is the plot?! This book had nothing, no climax, no major events, nothing happen untill about chapter 22; the book has 32 chapters. I found this book in the teen section of my local book store, I thought I'd give it a try as an easy read. Yes the book was easy to understand and the situations were clearly writen, but the book was boring! The author kept going on and on about useless facts. And did anyone esle notice how the author used his name as the main character's name? I was puzzled when I picked up the book and it read By:Darren Shan, and the title was Cirque Du Freak: The Darren Shan Saga, I looked everywhere for the author's name and couldn't believe it when someone told me. This Darren Shan is a gifted author, he just needs to learn more about how to keep his readers on the edge of their seats."
3,Not as good as the first,"In this sequel, Darren is adjusting to his new life as Mr. Crepsley's assistant. They return to the Cirque Du Freak. Darren becomes good friends with Evra, the snake boy.While traveling with the freak show Darren meets another friend, Sam. Sam wants to leave home and join the Cirque Du Freak. Darren, now a half-vampire, must learn the hard way that he can never have a normal life.I thought the 2nd book in the series was boring and a major letdown."
4,A.M.A.Z.I.N.G,"I read the book in one day, and i would have bought the next book in the series right away, if it wasn't for my lack of money. I wouldn't say, that it's better than the first book, but just as good."
3,Perhaps held my attention slightly more than book 1,It held my attention enough to read all three of the first trilogy- the three are connected - can't really just read one and expect to have a whole story. Each book feels like a chapter in a larger story. I think the central character's character lacked sufficient character for me to care about him. And frequently there was a bleakness without ambiance... it just felt like a dry read that I forced myself to finish because I bought all three of the first trilogy at the same time and was curious to see if I ever came to care about the story. But I left if with no desire to carry on with this writer.

5,"awesome punk,folk,klezmer sound","This is not your grandfather's klezmer music. sounds from the middle east,northern Africa, and even gypsy are entwined with authentic yiddish music. The title song, Ver Tanzt? (who's dancing)is an original composition that is sung with such raw emotion, you'll wonder if peace will ever come to Palestine and Israel. If you want a new experience in music - buy this!"
4,Good Buy,Definitely good product. Very sturdy and simple to put together. The lowest height settings was not as low as I'd like but I can live with it. The rubber beadings that provide the grip unfortunately picks dust. Hard to wipe the dust off. Delivery was on time and customer service help waive off the shipping fee which when purchasing through the one-click feature was not an available option.Pleased with my purchase and experience with Amazon.
5,perfect for my laptop,"I got new laptop but it gave me pain in my neck/back area when I used it for more than 30 minutes.But after I started using this notebook riser, it never happened! Very satisfied with it."
5,AWESOME,"This does exactly what I needed it to do. My laptop feels secure sitting on it and the height is perfect. Surprisingly I have it at the lowest setting, it can go much higher, but my laptop screen doesn't accommodate. Works great."
4,Wuthering Heights!,"This little laptop riser works wonderfully. Even with a rather large docking station, this riser has no problems accomodating the station and raising my laptop to be at the same height as my monitor, which is already on a stand with its base extended. Setting the height is straightforward and easy. My wife has had one for a couple of years already, and has had no problems."
3,Sturdy stand buy NOT travel-friendly,"Please note that this is an excellent stand, but NOT travel friendly.I used the stand at home on my desk and also as I laid on my bed and my couch and it was extremely sturdy so I was happy with it.I got it 2 days before a trip and the night before while trying to pack, I discovered that it's just too bulky to fit into my messenger-bag/carry-on ... which is what I wanted to use to carry around town so I could use it in cafes and such to work. I had to travel without my new stand. Very unhappy about that :-(I'm going to have to return this product to Amazon and get something more like the Kensington Riser Cooling Notebook Stand or the WizCrafter Foldable Stand."
1,Horribly unstable,"I read the reviews and had high hopes for this stand, but it is completely unstable and unsafe. The two pieces don't fit together in a way that keeps the laptop in position. It even bounces when a breeze comes through my window! It's tipped over backwards several times. I've just returned it and would advise you avoid this stand."
5,"Great product, great price","This product was just what I needed to make my laptop ""feel"" more like a desktop PC and provides a comfortable viewing height. Definitely worth the money. Great product."
4,3M Rises where others fail,I did quite a bit of research before buying this product and all I can say is this is surely a great riser that stood up where others failed. Only complaint is that it needs better back end cable management.
2,Constrained by laptop angle; Could be knocked over,"The stand is constrained by the angle of the laptop screen. I have an HP Pavilion and the screen only tips back to about a 135 degree angle. So if I want to use the stand to 1/2 of more of its possible adjustment, the screen will be facing downward. I can get the screen about 9 inches above the desk; I would like a little more but can't happen.There is nothing that really holds the laptop on the stand, so I am a little concerned about the potential to get knocked over. When the cleaning people come in, I take it off the stand just in case."
3,good riser--a little low for me,I've had this riser for about 8 months. I found myself sticking large books under the riser before it occurred to me that maybe I should get a different riser. My laptop is 17 inches--pretty big. I can't raise it too high on this riser because of the monitor angle and it starts to feel precarious.Just a word of warning (and it's difficult to do) but I recommend figuring out how much you'll want to raise your laptop before you purchase this riser. It's not a bad riser--it just doesn't work for me.You also have to take it apart to transport it safely-it's basically two pieces of molded plastic.
3,The Emperor has... Some Clothes,"For the almost perfect laptop stand, but with one glaring flaw. How do we use the headphone jack?!!! With the intricate diagram showing how to tuck cords on the stands rear, there could have been holes or a gap large enough in the front to accommodate the jacks. If you don't need headphones, by all means this does the job. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
3,Doesn't work with a MacBook,"This stand doesn't work with a MacBook or any thin laptop where that you open at the front center. The lip at the bottom edge of the stand is almost an inch thick, and prevents access to the notch in the front center of a MacBook. You can't open the lid while the MacBook is in the stand, and have to lift the computer out to open it."
2,"It holds the 17'', it does not give the right angle","The merit is that can hold a lot of weight without problem and the laptop is steady. But, it is not as sleek as it seems at the photo, it covers a lot of space (more than the computer itself), and also does not give for me the right angle; It goes the computer to high and the screen cannot go at a vertical position(it depends also from the computer). I would not buy it again, I would try some other product in case they were better."
3,"OK, needs more adjustability","I bought this to use with a 17"" Asus G73, a big laptop. It holds it securely. However this laptop screen doesn't tilt back far enough, so it cannot hold the laptop at a steep enough angle to get the screen vertical. Returning it was not worth the cost."
1,Awful grainy picture,"For a 6 head VCR the picture is terrible. The picture looks like those $20 VCR's you find at Walmart. I bought this to replace the Panasonic VCR that died, I should have bought another Panasonic. The DNR (dynamic noise reduction) does nothing to improve the picture. The Hi-Fi audio is also substandard. I am only using this as a backup until I find another Panasonic on Ebay. If you buy this VCR you will be disappointed if you are looking for great picture quality."
3,LEXMARK 10N0026,"good product, but in few occasion he was dry or the ink go through the cartridge when i was copying. THE DISPATCH WASN'T ALLWAYS THE ORIGINAL LEXMARK."
5,"Recommended by Terry Jastrow - President, Jack Nicklaus Productions","This is the book by the man who taught my niece how to hit a straight shot in one hour and prior to that she couldn't do it at all!It's all about how to master golf's outer, inner and scoring games!Worth your money mega times over!"
4,New to underwater photography,"This camera is loaded with options which can be a good or bad thing, sometimes finding the right function can be frustrating. It takes some very good pictures when I get them in focus, which probably says more about the operator rather than the camera. The battery life is much shorter than advertised, a back up battery is recomended. The operators manual is longer than some novels I have read, I would like to see a DVD on camera use and picture taking tips, this would help out beginners like myself."
5,Typical Tosh,"My 18 year old son loves Tosh, as do we. He's crude, yes, but too funny. We looked forward to listening to it together, and it didn't disappoint. Another great Tosh recording!"
5,Spot on funny,"Daniel Tosh's musings are crude, yet witty. The world according to Tosh would contain basketball-boxing as well as bigger, stronger, faster athletes. I'm not normally a comedy buff, but Daniel Tosh had my entire family rolling on the floor laughing. This is a great CD!"
2,What a disapoitment,The comdey was funny but the show was so short. It must have only been 30 min long. We kept looking on the DVD thinking there must be something else on it but were disapointed. Not worth the cost.
4,Please enter a title for your review,"The content on this album is about half great, half barely passable. There are contextless twist punchlines about sex, violence, or just random insanity that are rarely clever, and passing off ""Dave Matthews Band is sh**ty music"" as a joke is just lazy. He kinda imitates Jim Gaffigan's voices, Sarah Silverman's shock tactics, Bill Hicks' smug anti-conservatism, and possibly Dane Cook's naive imagination, but I'd be a lot happier to see this guy getting Cook's mainstream success. In the other half of the cd, when he can keep his punchlines at least some way relevent to the setups or make relevent clever observations drawn from real life, it's pretty consistently great. I don't really know what else to say about the set's strong points, there's nothing that stood out as uniquely effective about his ideas, style, or performance, but it made me laugh."
1,Awful,Bought this because a few Tosh.0 episodes were funny. This was very disappointing. DVD and CD are basically the same. DVD is only 1/2 hour. I would recommend Dane Cook who is similar or Brian Regan who is clean cut and absolutely hilarious.
1,Miserable,"Terrible. Minuscule vocabulary, many utterly useless anglo, tehcno or geographical words. Letter ""J"" for ejamplo... You will find ""Jamaique"", ""jazz"", ""jersey"", ""jogging"", but try finding: ""jabot, jacassement, jacasse, jach?re; jacinthe; Jacques Bonhomme; jacter etc..."" No luck.Don't be misled by their advertised ""more than 100,000 translations"". It feels more like 3-4,000 French most rudimentary words at most. What were they thinking?What the Harrap should really have done is to reissue their 1982 hardcover edition of an exhaustive, ""New College"" dictionary. In fact, I thought I was to receive the pocket-sized version of that book."
5,I love these mitts!,"I wasn't quite certain that I would use these drying mitts often, but I really do! They're great for getting extra water off the dishes out of the dishwasher, and a lot safer to use than my flour sack towels, because I get a better grip on the glassware. They really are thirsty, soak up lots of water quickly. A couple of minutes in the dryer, and they're ready to go."
2,Too many trainers,There are too many trainers in this DVD. You really don't have time to change position until they already began workout. It is too complicated and workouts are kind of old looking.
2,Very retro and repetitive,"After using various DVDs from different eras of The Firm, it was weird using this one. It felt very 80s and many of the exercises were repetitive. Plus, there's kind of bad music and the microphone dangling above the leader all the time, which makes it seem cheesy.That said, it was a challenging workout, but I had a lot of problems with aesthetics and some of the 80s-style moves."
5,The touch of a Hero,"I'm a college student and last year I made a Presentation about Nicaragua In my class of Latin America stadies. I had this book over six months, but I never read it. To me it did not had material I need it. This past weekend I started to read and my surprise was, that it's full of so many emotions and information material. It explained the whys and doubts of the people to change the Somaza government and How big part the college students played in this amazing revolution movement to made it come true. It's one of the best bood I had read about the Guerrilla war in Latin America."
5,Delicious,"Steiner products have always been of very high quality and well worth the price. Wheather your spotting game or just fooling around they always prove to be very dependable. While I,ve just recently purchased this pair my grandfather has had his for 11 years, still in fine condition. The rubber coating is very durable. Highly recommended."
4,Best single release by LB!,"So Limp Bizkit released Results MAy Vary. No Wes Borland. Softer sound. But overall decent. The single cd of Eat You Alive has to be the best release in LB's career. Not because of the song, but because of the B-sides. Just Drop Dead was Fred's setaliation to Britney Spears after their controversial relationship. This single also includes anothe RMV b-side in Shot."
2,I'LL EAT YOU ALIVE!!!!! (I'll eat you alive!),"Haha! Wan't a nice, tasty meal in the morning, afternoon or at night? Well, this song will help you decide which to eat, which is EAT YOU ALIVE!!!!!!! Mmmmmmm tasty!!! Nah i'm just playing around (although I do like eating...). I think that this isn't a great song and Limp Bizkit'z 'Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water' was really flawed. It was not very good. 3 Dolla Bill Y'all and Significant Other were much better. 'Results May Vary', their new album is now out but I don't know if its good or not. I probably won't buy it though."
2,Disappointing production,"Well first I was very disappointed to find out that this is more of a story telling documentary type production than an entertaining movie based upon historical fact. This made for a pretty boring product in my opinion. This looks like a low budget effort as there are only a hand full of characters and you only see them every once in a while. This is mostly third party narration while we get to look at pictures and artists renditions which are supposed to enhance the story but fail miserably.Next, I thought the documentary was heavily biased and put all the blame for the conflict on the United States. Only after watching the first part and seeing the credits did I find out that this documentary was a product of the National Film Board of Canada. I guess that explains the bias part.Anyway, in my opinion this isn't worth spending your money on. There are many other better historical based war films out there."
5,Finally!,"Finally we have a book that maps out magickal systems as they relate to science, specifically- Quantum Physics. So refreshing to see that the authors of this book are down-to-Earth and non-flaky (no McWiccans here) and delve into the nature of reality and the universe."
4,Great for Beginners,"I've known Jim (River) & Joyce for over 10 years now, and I'm so happy they finally put to text some of the knowledge that I've seen them regularly share with new initiates into the craft here in their home-base of St. Louis, MO. I can't wait to see what they write next as they expand their writing into more advanced texts.The book is well thought out and easy to follow for any new beginner. It is more of an introduction into Paganism for non-pagans, or those just entering their initiation. This work-book layout is a great way to not just read about, but learn about the basics and concepts of Paganism (no matter which path you follow).I'd recomend this book as an introduction into Paganism and required reading for any initiate, although for the advanced learner I didn't find any new information worth recomending."
4,Paganism,This book put it all together for me. I'm new to the word but not to the ways I feel and live.
3,Long winded,"The books has alot of good info for beginners, like me. But I found some of the chapters to be repetitious. In most instances the authors point was made in 1 paragraph, no need to continue dragging it out to fill a page. Overall the book was interesting. I would recommend it."
3,Great info but hard to read,"This is an excellent informational book and probably the only one you would need to answer any questions about paganism you might have. It is a great textbook and reference book but it is not easy reading. Kind of overwhelming and a bit dry and scholarly. I wouldn't buy it for leisurely enjoyment, but I am getting great and thorough information out of it. I recommend it for knowledge but not for entertainment."
2,Definitely an Introduction,"Honestly, I haven't read the whole book yet. I've read the first four chapters though and this book is entirely too elementary for me. All I've learned before this book has been over the internet for a period of two months. Unless this is your first effort to learn anything about Paganism, I don't recommend this book. I felt as if I was being spoken to like a child, which it very well may be intended for since they mentioned bible school a number of times, but for a true beginner, this may be ignorable. On the other hand, I'm only 16 and it's been driving me nuts.So yes, this is a good introduction, but if you've already gotten past that very first bit of knowledge (which is probably what peaked your interest in the first place) this book probably isn't for you."
3,review,"""Paganism, also called neo-Paganism, is a new religious movement..."" first sentence, Chapter 1, P.1Enough said."
5,Just what I was looking for...,"I truly cannot say enough about this book. I have practiced an earth based spiritual tradition for a while now and this book was just the missing piece of my puzzle. It is a must have for anyone who is searching for answers in today's spiritual enigma. It includes many excercises, step by step meditations, and journal topics to aid you on your spiritual journey. I found this to be a great book for helping my children to evaluate what they feel and believe about the great life force of this universe we live in."
5,Paganism,"I originally obtained this book through my library to obtain more information about Paganism. The term ""pagan"" has long been used as a derogatory term to identify a non-christian. Since Christianity did not appear on the scene until the beginning of the current era, that means everyone who lived before the advent of this religion were pagan. That is about the extent of what most people know about Paganism. This book provided excellent insight into the religion both many aspects including scientific, spiritual, historical and legal. I was so impressed by the information included in this book that I ordered ""Pagan Spirituality, A Guide to Personal Transformation"" by the same author.For me, Paganism: An Introduction to Earth-Centered Religions is a good book to begin exploring not only Paganism but other religions as well."
3,Good but...,"This book has lots of great information. I held back two stars only because of an irritating unbalance. When describing the varieties of pagan traditions they state that the task is too large and they give only a brief paragraph to a few leading traditions. Then, they dedicate an entire chapter to the off topic controversy of satanism, while all along admitting that it's not actually pagan. I really felt that they should have mentioned this controversy, if at all, in a brief paragraph and dedicated that entire chapter to a fuller discussion of the actual subject at hand, pagan traditions."
3,Good broad introduction,"This book does a good job of giving a general description of paganism as a whole. The authors don't go into very much detail about the different disciplines though; so if you are looking for information regarding a specific type of paganism (like druidism for instance), then you should probably look elsewhere. The content is geared towards people who have had no contact with pagans before. The Higginbothams are very knowledgable and they make excellent arguments for their points, but there are two criticisms that I have:1. It felt too much like a workbook. Meditation exercises...journal entries....discussion topics....if I wanted to take a class, I would have taken a class.2. The book at times had a very defensive tone to it. I understand that the preconcieved notions regarding paganism had to be broken down, but I just wanted the facts.All in all this was a good (not great) book that has piqued my interest in other areas of paganism."
4,An excellent intro,"This is the book which started me on a neo-Pagan path, and I still believe it is an excellent resourcce. If you know nothing about Paganism, then this book with help open your eyes to the potential the religion provides.Unlike most Pagan books (of any level) this attempts a discussion of the theology and philosophy of paganism, which makes it better than many of the so-called 101 books.The exercises are interesting, and helpful. They also are the only negative I have about the book. Their meditations and visualizations do tend more toward New Age fluff, but if you have never meditated they are a good way to ease into the practice."
5,misconception,"I admit when I heard that this young man had lost his brother I thought the book would only be about such things as Hatred, Despise, and pure Evil. My misconception could be credited to the cover of the book, but as I read it I was feeling the same feelings the author felt. The author expresses his feelings towards LIFE and is not drewling on the lost of his brother. I feel he is LIVING for his brother. The poems express the many feelings we as human beings encounter. Whatever mood I am in there is a poem in ""n'nocent 7age"" that I can relate to. This is a talented young author and I cannot wait to view his up and comming projects. I sincerely advise the purchase of this book. You will enjoy this increadible peice of literature and want more. I smiled, laughed, cried, and even wrote a few poems of my own as I enjoyed ""n'nocent 7age"" and you will as well. Trust me when I say this book is off the charts!"
2,A disappointing recording,"This DVD is a reissue of an LP record that was first issued by the Library of Congress in the 1950s. Though ""authentic,"" the songs are poorly performed by older people singing, mostly unaccompanied and off-key. There are other, better-done versions of many of these songs."
4,Great book,My son loves all of the David books and this one was the perfect next step in the series.
3,It's look like a new second hand,Just ok condition for a new book with a look of a second hand quality
1,Creepy,"The pictures are just plain creepy. What' the point of this book? Nothing interesting at all here ... except those freaky pictures, which I prefer to live without. Brrrrr."
1,Not Recommended,I have put this book away indefinitely. Ever since reading this to my twins (almost 3 years old) they have decided to imitate David and pull the cat's tail. I am not sure I understand the message intended from this book. Is it funny to be naughty? David's does not experience enough consequences from his misbehavior.
2,"Creepy, indeed.","The illustrations are very distressing to look at. It gives me a sick in the gut feeling that I usually only get in a surrealist gallery. I'm not sure that this book has a redeeming message. Yes, kids misbehave. Yes, they don't want to take personal responsibility. I would have liked to see David learn that he was in charge of his actions."
2,Cute book,"I think this is a cute book. My son, who is delayed in learning, is able to read by sight of the pictures in this book.However, I am rather dismayed at the page with the caption ""But daddy says it!"" because of the picture of David sitting in the bathroom with a bar of soap in his mouth. We don't feel that is an appropriate form of punishment, and it's rather difficult to explain to young children why David has soap in his mouth. In that regard, I am happy I don't own it and only checked it out of the library."
5,Great For Discussion,"This book is very good for increasing reasoning and general discussion with my son. There are not many words in the book, so if you are looking for a book for ""reading"" then this is not for you. I love asking my son questions like ""What should David's mother do?"" ""Why do you think that David got in trouble for that?"" ""Why is what David did dangerous?"" ""How would you behave in that situation?"". Sometimes I act like I am David so that my son can ""correct"" my behavior, or sometimes we think of silly answers to ""What should his mom do?"" Answer...Make him go to school with his clothes on backward!I love this series and I think that it is a lot of fun for me and my 6 year old."
4,"not as good as 'no, david!'","While this is still a fun book, our 3 year-old (and her daddy, i admit) found this one not nearly as good as ""No, David!""[ASIN:0590930036 No David!]]; on a number of the pages, it's not clear why or how David got in trouble.(Edit added 3 years later) - I think I was much too harsh. Our 3 year-old is now our 6 year-old, and this is still one of her favorite books, which I think says a lot for it. And once you've read it a few times it's pretty clear why and how David got in trouble :). Upping from 3 stars to 4.What makes the David series so attractive is that the child gets to empathize with David, while also getting to feel a bit ""grown-up"" for knowing better than to act as David does. And they all end with David taking responsibility for his actions and getting hugs and love. Very nice."
2,There's no consequence or explanation.,"I read this book to my daughters and was surprised by the jolting abrupt change from outright denial and lack of responsibility to contrition in the title character. He spends the majority of the book happily causing mayhem, and either lying about it or making excuses...and then, at night changes his mind...with no reason given as to why. There are no consequences to his actions, in only one page is he shown getting into actual trouble. He wasn't punished or told that what he was doing was wrong. It is an unsatsfying end, and misses teaching a lesson."
5,The title of this book and it's philosophy,"are exactly waht I used to raise three kids.When they were very young, I gave them an explanation the first time:""Get off that wall, or you'll break your nose """" Why ? "" ( Their usual answer )""BECAUSE I SAY SO ! ""... end of discussion.Now, as in this book, it can't be so drastic with teenagers: This book has a wonderful attitude towards guiding, understanding and coming to terms with our teenagers...Now, forty years later, my kids are my best friends and admit I did it right !What a great pleasure !"
5,Enjoyable Mix of Smooth Jazz & Groove,"Michael Sims collection ""Room With A Groove"" is very aptly titled. You will find equal parts of smooth, sultry guitar with jazzy funk that is altogether quite palatable. Michael's two collaborations with Gerald Albright are especially nice. It's a shame that smooth jazz radio did not discover this project, which is another coal on the fire of smooth jazz radio stations disappearing from U.S. markets. The format needs more of the kind of music you'll find here on Michael Sims collection and less Pop and R&B. Also, song writing on this release is creative and invigorating."
2,okay...,"A lot of the advice written in here is very good but a lot of it also isn't. Some of it is so obvious but anyhow, I felt that the author pushed the point that people should take it upon themselves to find Mr. Right. When we should really trust God to do it for us, I've read dozens of dating/courting books and the one that I like best is ""When God Writes Your Love Story by Eric and Leslie Ludy."" Its more realistic."
2,Could have done without the preaching,"The title of this book is a little mis-leading. It should have been called ""How to find Mr. Right using the Bible"". I am Christian but I found all of the constant refrences and Bible quotes to be overwhelming. I was searching for a book about how to find Mr. Right, not really a book about how to use the 10 commandments to find a decent non-good-looking guy. It does however have many valid points and the Bible is a good refence point for most things in life.... but this was just too much God for me to handle for entertainment sake."
1,horrible,"not gonna lie, im a HUGE nonpoint fan, i loved the first three albums, songs like endure, mindtrip, signs, the same, the truth, etc. they are, or were, so bad ass, i bought this album only hearing 'bullet w/ a name' thinking that, ok, this song is.... ok, but hey, its NONPOINT! you know the rest of the album will blow you away....... not tru, in fact bullet w/ a name is one of the best songs on the album. yes, best songs on album... overall im very dissapointed and want my 12 bux back. it reminds me of metallica's st. anger dissaster, wanting to go harder and sounding like a pile of crap.newho, save yourself the money and download some songs... youll see in a quicky this album is not worth your money"
2,This CD Sucks,"I loved Nonpoint's older cd ""Recoil"". I rocked out to it every day for a while, every track was pretty awesome. I thought this cd was going to be even better. Luckily I have Rhapsody so I just listened to it on there and realized hey, this cd sucks a lot. Me and my friends all agree that they put out a poor effort and should be banished from the music industry. Nonpoint didn't know what they were doing on this album. Nothing is catchy or groovy or anything, it just sounds like random spatterings of music on all of the songs. I don't know why other reviews say that it is good because let me tell you, it is not. Download the songs before you buy it and you too will see the truth."
1,OPEN YOUR F#@#!$G EARS!,I think that reviewer s. woodson is a dumbass and wouldn't know good music if it kicked him in his ass. These guys are as good as it gets in my book and they deserve the respect that they have earned.
3,Promising Band,"This band shows a lot of promise. The songs are energetic and pack major modern rock punch - the problem is that the production on this album is pretty thin overall. The overall sound is missing bottom and has a tin-like quality. It's a shame because the songs and performances alike are strong. The vocals exhibit a well-rounded dynamic approach, and the guitar playng is interesting, providing bith punishing and melodic touches. In terms of production, however, the drum and bass are too low and thin and the guitars and vocals are acerbic and treble-heavy. The album may very well have been a 4-star caliber album in my opinion had the production been better."
3,Not That Bad Of A CD!!!,"I Thought This CD Wasn't That Bad, So Far The Best Nonpoint CD To Me! Only About 4 Songs Really Stood Out To Me.I Would Go Out & Purchase This CD!*Bullet With A Name*The Wreckoning*Alive and Kicking*To The Pain"
4,solid cd form a very good band,"nonpoint third album is a great cd,Nonpoint is a very talented band and it shows here. The songs in this album are very strong ones and Elias shows his great vocals. Still the best album of nonpoint is Statement .best songs:wrong before,code red,buscandome,alive and kicking"
4,miami,good band from south florida been listing to them since day 1. got all the albums. this new one roxxx.
3,"Nonpoint is the Best, but","The first 4 songs are great, all the songs after range from mediocre to bad. What frustrates me is that these songs could have been great, but suffer from bad/rushed production and seemingly not enough time for the songs to mature in the song writing process.Nonpoint show incredibly musical ability, but outside of the first 4 songs the rest of the album is a frustrating missed opportunity.One last thing: What's with the gun clicking in the beginning? How cliche is that?"
3,"Good, but not their best","Nonpoint doesn't fail to deliver hard-hitting aggression, but I feel they've sacrificed a good amount of their melodious element. This is a good album, but there isn't enough variation. I'd say if you like one song on this album, you'll like them all."
5,best album of '05,"if you're a fan of statement, this album will blow you away.best album i've heard this entire year. never a disapointment... purchase this record, and you won't be sorry."
1,The zoom broke twice,"Don't buy this camera. The zoom broke twice. The first time was after a little bit more than a year of using it. It was out of warranty so I had to pay almost $200 to get a replacement (bad decision, I know). The customer service was really bad. Then the zoom broke again last month. I had such a bad experience with HP that I decided to buy a Cannon."
3,Give or take,"Not terribly impressed with this unit. I gave it a try for about a week before I gave up on it. I finally settled on Korg Gt-120, which I love.I don't know much about stobe tuning, but I don't think this really is one. It seems to me that it's just a gimmicky way of displaying the output of a standard digital tuner.If you have a mic stand to mount it on (and the space for it) I could see where it could be convenient in that way, but I don't have a dedicated place to keep mine, so it stays in desk drawer until I need it. It's pretty big and bulky compared to the gt-120 and other tuners I use.For what it's worth, it seems to do a fine job of letting you tune your instruments, it's just the esthetics of it I didn't care for. Both the display, and the physical attributes of the unit itself just didn't 'do it' for me."
2,Great Picture but antiquated remote and VCR features,"This product delivers a great picture, even from old, self-taped programs. However, there are many features that are behind the times - mostly on the remote. For instance, no mute button, no ability to 'jump' to previous channel, channel buttons are really small, shuttle knob is a waste of space (I would rather push a button anyday). As for the recorder itself, only being able to program 8 SINGLE DAY entries for recording is at least 10 years out of date. With no ability to put in the same program for a week (you have to reprogram everyday or use up five of your entries on one program), and finally, the SLP quality is so poor it's 'usability' is non-viable even with the correct tape type.Frankly, I would return it but packing it up and finding a UPS drop point is too much trouble. I'll put it away and use it as a backup, but in the future I will purchase my electronics from a ... where I can 'see' the features."
2,not as pictured,I thought I was getting all items pictured items but only got 3 two scrapers and the mop. Had to make another order and pay another shipping to get the handle. The items are worthless with out the handle
1,Ripped off by Amazon !,I bought what I thought was a David Crosby DVD of a Live Concert. What I got was a DVD that just plays music one my DVD player. Why would I want to spend big bucks for a DVD that is nothing but a CD. Man do I feel ripped off!I wish I had my money back.They got me on this one.Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!Greg Russell
1,Ugh!!!!!!!,"I personally thought that the book was a degrading attempt to capture the magic of Harry Potter and run with it. IT was utterly pointless. I couldn't belive that anyone wrote this. It had a poor, unorganized plot, a trite, commonplace overview and an uninteresting fantasy world that reminded me why I dislike this particular genre of stories (expect for Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) Don't read this novel, it will only disappoint you."
1,Boring,"Nothing special, boring prose, cliched characters. Not worth the time unless you want the literary equivilent of cold porridge."
5,Wonderful.,"I believe the word used was sundown over at ...... but this is clearly the dawn of a new day. This book tells of an incredible journey for one girl. I've made sure to give the title to every woman I know, because each and every one of them can relate to Lera in some way.I hope to read more by Ms. Romey in the very near future and wish her the best of luck in her writings."
2,Don't fit car described,"The product ordered was checked to fit the Camaro. Site / Size all said the fit was matched to the vehicle. However, it was fitted for a smaller car.. maybe a smart car. Not a CHEVY of any type. Should be able to verify the product by size and vehicle specs. Guess that's too much to ask..."
1,I am not satisfied.,I am not satisfied. The price is irrelevant ...I really do not remain satisfied with the quality ... It has articles that are poorly executed....
4,Very Independant film,"It's tough to find good Filipino films. This isn't excellent for the film industry, but it's the best Filipino film I've seen so far. It's not for Hollywood fans, shot entirely in the Phillipines by amatuer actors, but I enjoy that sort of thing and enjoyed this film. The main character will make you just fall in love with him, he's great."
4,better then average,"Not a sex movie. Deals with a young man who favors the other side of life, but maintains the lifestyle with the approval of all around him. He is a very caring young man and wiser then his age. He has a crush on a man in his twenties who does not take advantage of the boy, but later on the man does something to destroy the boy's image as he had seen it. A good clean movie that looks at the other side of someone's young life."
2,"wow, not what I thought the advertising promises","Very disappointing, the story has potential but the film fails to deliver more than a few nuggets.Acting was poor. Story was not believable.I expected a warm coming of age story about a typical gay pre-teen growing up in the slums of Manila. It does a reasonable job of depicting the slums, poverty, petty thievery, family bonds, and corruption of the police. But I just can't believe the main character. He is off the scale effeminate gay; I found it difficult to believe this character would survive in the surroundings he existed in. I have never seen a boy behave like he did or dress in this way - I just found him hard to believe, not genuine, more like an over-acted stereotype. It didn't work for me.Poor acting, poorly written script, and characters not believable......I was really disappointed."
2,Bloom Already!,"Dear Reader,I find this film hard to believe. So much of the time, till the last 10 minutes, I tried to give it the benefit. My review is based on the inconsistency of the film and how it does not manage to keep the time/day and time, place and events in proper sequence. I guess the producers thought we wouldn't notice suttle differences in what people are wearing, to what people say and do when the camera cuts and pans over to a different angle.Overall I am disapointed with this film because I went to great lenghts to rent it from our big local movie rental places. Only one place had it in stock under the foreign sections.The acting was slow and painful, yet the boy was easy to look at and feel compassion for, regardless of quality of film. The love romance between the two main characters is too hyped up by the reviews, it is simply a crush that flew in and didn't seem to make a difference toward the end of the film.Bloom, bloom little one! We are still waiting!"
2,"good DVD but,,,You had better like to read the movie for yourself!",A good movie & if you like to read then its a great DVD if not then don't buy!!
3,Doubt: A History,"""Doubt: A History"" is quite a slog. No one ""angle"" by author. Much material known or available elsewhere, but appreciated having so many eras and ideas in one volume."
5,going forward,"I appreciate this book.Years ago I saw a cartoon in some Christian youth material. The figure of a young Christian soldier in a medieval suit of armor. No offensive weapons but a shield with the word Bible written on it. Arrows with labels, such as Evolution, were bouncing off the shield and armor.The author, Jennifer Hecht, has given those that doubt the equivalent of a M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank to go forward with.Ralph Stewart"
4,Too many pages,"500 Pages! That's too long unless you are a history buff. She may have settled for 100 pages. She followed doubt for 2600 years. Who cares? She had half a dozen good, new ideas. She's tired of the words, believers, agnostics and athiests and suggested you call yourself a skeptic, a doubter, a sectarian, et al. What difference does it make. A better word for god is the unknown. There are a lot of better words but if you like your word, keep it! Who cares. Whatever she read she saw doubt ""out of the corner of her eye."" Now we can all find doubt hidden under every stone we pick up. Give me a break."
1,Disappointed - tedious to read,"I was excited about this book and invested (wasted) quite a bit of time trying to read it. Unfortunately, it is way too tedious. The author may be knowledgeable and I am fully supportive of skeptics but I will never again buy any book written by her due to her writing style. I like to read books by Sam Harris and I enjoy reading Susan Jacoby but I just cannot handle the tedious, never-ending babbling of Jennifer Michael Hecht."
4,"An Impressive Work Spanning 2,000 Years of History","I am not a doubter and have a difficult time understanding how one cannot have faith. But I accept that as a reasonable position. I have always been an avid student of philosophy and theology. I think that there is great value in understanding the perspectives of those with doubt and without faith and how ""doubters"" have effected societal and political development. Ms. Hecht takes us on an astounding 2,000-year journey across history and introduces us to the preeminent thinkers in the history of doubt from every continent. It is a most impressive and immensely readable journey. It is important to note that this journey is not for the novice. If you don't have a background in Greek philosophical and Christian theological writings, this may be a challenging read even though Ms. Hecht makes this information very accessible and readable."
3,A small taste of musical pleasure,"This Greatest Hits cd is lacking way too much to be called that. Your best bet would be to get his Best of CD or one of the double albums like Changes/Rewind, or One of the Wiskey A GoGo albums.Johnny Rivers was one of the better singers from the Sixies era. Unfortunetly he was overshadowed by a anotherJohnny of the time, Johnny Mathis.Factoid. Most people think that Secret Agent Man was the onlytv theme song that Johnny sung. He did another for a children'scartoon show. ""The Mighty Hercules"".If your real lucky, you might be able to find a copy of it as a single somewhere online."
2,"Original Songs? "" I Think Not ""","It's a good thing you're able to listen to part of the songs before you buy, because these are not the original recordings! The sound is not bad, but the real thing is better, believe me!"
5,Big and Beefy,I bought these to use in the restoration of my 1937 John Deere tractor. I need something heavy duty that extended upward pretty high. These are absolutely perfect. Well worth the money.
1,They don't stick!,"These labels look great on glass jars for about an hour, and then they peal away. I would look for another label that has more stick."
5,Steiner Predator 10X42 Binoculars,"I've owned and looked through many different pairs of binoculars and I can honestly say for the money Steiner's are the way to go. You could spend more money, but why? The best testimonial I can give is the reaction people give me when they look through my Steiners. ""I've got to have a pair!"" The exact thought I had, when I first looked through an old pair of Big Horn 9X40's. The Predator 10X42's picture is clear, crisp and sharp, even at night. Get a pair and look at a full moon, you can see craters. My 10X42's go with me wherever I go, and they always will."
3,Over priced in my opinion,"Despite being well reviewed in a UK magazine, these binoculars suffer from obvious false colour. I bought a pair and was astonished to find that birds in flight are surrounded by a multi-colour blur, the surface of a pond turned purple, and a Shelduck sprouted two extra necks. In my opionion these binoculars are not worth the high price. I now stick to my cheap Nikon Egret IIs as they give significantly better images."
1,Poor Packaging.,"I bought this silverware for my best friends wedding present, and the silverware is pretty but the packaging that it came in is horrible and beaten up. I am embarresed to even give it to her in the packaging that it came in"
4,Interesting way to present cases,"The cases on the DVDs are presented from both sides of the story. You have the opportunity to hear several stories, then at the end they tell you the actual outcome of the real case. Interesting to students in a criminal justice class."
2,A little too expensive,This product is overpriced. I bought it for my husband hoping it would soothe his skin and he is not thrilled. Said I should just bought him some rubbing alcohol!
2,"Very Astringent, but foul smelling","A very effective toner. Really good at keeping pores clear and sweeping away dead skin cells. Probably too drying to use everyday unless you have extremely oily skin or active acne.Works great as an drying spot treatment for an occasional pimple. Dip a Q-Tip in and apply on any spots.My biggest problem with this product is the smell. Although it only contains plant-based ingredients, it's quite unpleasant. And it lingers on your skin for minutes after application. I would describe the odor as a mix of witch hazel, kerosene, and spoiled meat. I'll definitely try other mens line toners before buying this again."
4,Gulliver,"Although this is not the Gullivers travels I remember from Family Classics with Frasier Thomas, I still enjoyed it. The acting ,of course was cheezy,but,I still enjoyed it. I will continue to look for the other version i remember."
3,Aren't there any widescreen prints left in existance?,"Once again (I believe it happenned with the Laser disc as well).Gulliver gets released with the ""Ray Harryhausen Signature Collection"" label on a panned and scanned version of the film.This time it's not only digitally mastered audio and video but remastered in High Definition.If they had to remaster it anyway,why didn't they start with widescreen elements.I think Harryhausen is a master and still give the film 5 stars.This DVD however is dissapointing.The extras are for the most part on other DVD's in the collection.And if we were only getting one aspect ratio, full screen was not the one to go with."
3,THE GENIUS OF HARRYHAUSEN,"""THE HARRYHAUSEN CHRONICLES"" focuses on the art of Ray Harryhausen. This affectionate and classy documentary is a perfect companion title to the feature ""20 Million Miles to Earth."" Narrated by Leonard Nimoy and written, produced and directed by Richard Schickel, Time magazine's film critic and film historian, this entertaining celebration of Harryhausen's singular cinematic legacy features numerous film clips and observations by George Lucas and others whose lives were impacted by his films. Harryhausen says the ""essence of fantasy is the transfer of reality into the imagination."" Certainly his remarkable stop-motion sequences have entertained generations and haunted memories. Schickel says it best with an observation spoken by Nimoy: ""In this moment of mechanized imagination, this unforgettable work recalls for us the value of the open and wondering eye and the informed and compassionate heart."""
1,Dont be fooled like me! I feel I was Mislead,"When if found this knife set online I was extermely happy. What a great product to buy my chef husband for our anniversary, $400 for this set was a great deal so I decided to go out of my budget and buy it. only to find that when they confirmed that it was being shipped and i went on line to track it i found it wasnt this set being shipped to me anymore it was an entierly different useless lesser quality set and now this one seems to have dissapperd from the web site. at least i finally found it in my computers history. It also seems very convenient that it will no longer be avaliable!!!! I am outragged and will be telling everyone I know about this and filling many endless complaints! Athena George"
1,Disturbing-To say the least.,"I saw this recently and was to say the least, very disturbed by the video surveilence of Kell KILLING Blackmon. It is a very sad true life story of one very disturbed individual.Troy Kell comes from Nevada, he has, now, no life..he has not had one since he was 17. He was incarcerated for a BRUTAl murder of a Man who was ""stalking and harrassing"" his childhood friend, ""Sandy"".He committeda brutal crime, shot a man 6 (SIX) times in the head at close range. This documentary shows the real inside of prison life, allbeit through the eyes of a very disturbed young individual. Kell is articulate and comes across as highly intelligent. But is he really?, he is now on Death Row.Very good documentary but also very disturbing."
1,Who Cares? I Don't!,"I guess I've been desensitized to the horrible lifes and conditions that prisoners are made to live through. Oh, poor babies!Frankly, I don't give a damn if they are kept in cages and are only given food and water. Many of the cable stations broadcast Prison ""Soaps"" daily. The shock value of their crimes and their lifes behind bars has become every day drama, and soooooooooo repetitive.I didn't find this documentary exceptional in any way."
5,REALITY THERAPY AT ITS BEST!!!!!!,"I VIEWED THIS MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME AT WORK AS A PART OF A VIOLENT GANG PAROLE SQUAD TRAINING CLASS. I HAVE WORKED IN THE PRISON SYSTEM FOR 10 YEARS, AND TO THIS DAY, THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO EXPRESS TO ANYONE WHO HAS NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO THE INSIDE OF PRISON THE REAL LIVE REALITY OF PRISON LIFE. I IN AN EXTREME WAY, AS A PAROLE OFFICER, LOVING MOTHER AND WIFE RECOMMEND ANY PARENT WITH A TEEN GOING DOWN THE WRONG ROAD TO MAKE THEIR TEEN VIEW THIS MOVIE. VERY VIOLENT SO NOT MEANT FOR KIDS (PRE-TEEN)WITHOUT A VERY EXTREME TOUGH LOVE REASON."
4,Shockingly graphic yet poignant,"A shocking look at crime and punishment. Never before has there been a documentary so real and graphic in its look at prison life. Troy Kell, the assailant, killed a black prisoner in a Utah prison in 1995. The attack was caught on tape, and depicts the horrific stabbing of the prisoner by Kell. What's perhaps just as fascinating is that Kell is an articulate, intelligent, smooth talking young man who could just as easily have become a doctor, lawyer or something comparable. But ultimately we realize that Kell is one thing -- a natural born killer. A fascinating piece."
4,Good core book for wavelets,"This book does a good job at providing a unified framework both for wavelets and subband filtering and decomposition, and so I would give it 5 stars were not for it only covers biorthogonal filters in the last chapter, and at the very last moment. If you need to understand how wavelets are related to filtering, signal processing and signal compression, this is your book, but it's not specific to any of this fields, and is very 1D oriented, with 2D processing only mentioned."
3,good shoes but not very comfortable,"these are good shoes and look nice but they are not very comfortable, so I only wear them if i have to stand minimally. I would actually buy half a size bigger and that might feel better."
1,Bring your own ruler,"I bought this rain gauge about a year ago because it appeared to be well made, and would last for a long time. After 6 months outside, it is nothing more than a glass tube mounted to a fence. The measurement numbers have disappeared from the glass."
1,numbers washed off in less than a year,"I bought this product last year. It collects rain accurately. After spending the winter outside, the painted numbers on the glass vial began to wash off. Now I can only guess by reading the metric side. I am now shopping for a replacement. Rere"
4,Well made rain gauge,"Bought as a Christmas present. Well made, compact and attractive. It is small, but it will do the job."
3,Looks nice. Metal frame a little on the cheep side,"Glass & gradations are good. Metal frame is a little on the cheep side, but fine as long as not somewhere where it would get abused (tree branches? squirrels? etc.) Like the looks. I would buy this again."
5,Looks great!,Got this for Christmas. Mounted outside my kitchen window on fence. Looks great and easy to read.
2,Does not fit !,"I purchased this reflector in the hope of protecting my Norman Standard 5"" 2D reflectors, my 2D-ML reflector and the, 5"" 2D reflector with diffuser. Unfortunately this protector only fits the 2D reflector with diffuser. It does not fit the other 2 reflectors that need it the most ! The diffused reflector already has a glass diffused dome that protects the bulb. This is typical behavior of Norman, they have serious Quality issues that are never addressed even after the product has been on the Market for a while."
3,Thinner than what I expected,"I bought this cover for our SUV and it almost fit the car like a semi custom made car cover. Another good thing about this cover is that it has two mirror pockets. The cover is thinner than common car covers and it is hard to believe that it can protect car's exterior against sun (UV rays), moisture and rain. Since, it is very light so installation and removal process will be easy. The company claims that this CoverCraft is US made, but it is made in Mexico. (I guess the material is US made.)Pros:+ Light weight+ Fit mid-size SUV like semi custom made coversCons:- Very thin compare to other covers I used in the past- Made in Mexico- Do not protect well against rain (Not water resistant)"
1,whatever,"Jeez, this soundtrack is missing four songs listed in the end credits of the movie. I remember some played in movie. These missing songs are 'Wish I May' by Breaking Benjamin, `Halloween' by Dream Syndicate, and two from Queens of the Stone Age 'You Can't Quit Me Baby' and 'If Only,' ...What kind of movie soundtrack is this?"
5,Nice stuff,"Work out very well, good size, no problem. I feel good because i don't want to drive and hit any kind of animal to die."
5,Creative Zen W,I have owned this for approximately six weeks now and after some initial hiccups with software used for DVD movies this device has worked like a charm. Screen size is great and as I travel every week I receive constant stares as people walk up and down the aisle of the airplane! It is like an IPOD on Steroids!!!
3,"Great product, just hate wasting time converting.","I loved using this product, especially the fact that I can plug this into the TV and watch movies, listen to music, and view photos. I just hate the fact that not all video files are acceptable and need to be converted.AVI files are said to be supported, but I had to convert most of my AVI files via Creative Zen converter. It took me at least 8hrs per file because I wanted the files converted to the best possible quality. Thats about 3 files a day! After a week and a half of conversion, I had 15 gigs of space left.So WARNING to all you people who are looking at multimedia players, if you dont mind waiting for your files to be converted, this is a Great media Player.Battery life is good, video quality is great, and its definately portable and could be plugged into TV whereever you want to take your media."
2,Only trouble and big regret of wasting money,"After purchasing the item in december 2006 it didnt take even a week before the troubles started, it kept freezing after switching it on and took quite long to rebuild the data. At one point, (after two weeks) I lost all my data. Despite downloading the software from the website the problems didnt disappear and i am basically left with a promising player which doesnt even allow me to listen to music without frezing.Since then i am struggling with Creative Technical SUpport team as thereis advise given to charge my battery or download the software from the website (which both is not been of much help)This player hasnt been much of use to me yet and I deeply regret having paid 360 USD.I gave it 2 stars because I was able to watch 2 movies while waiting at the airport and travelling, this was quite a pleasure."
2,"HELP!!! From Camp Arifjan, Kuwait.","Could someone please help me get some use out of this device. I work in Kuwait as a DOD Contractor on Camp Arifjan. This is my first player and I cannot return it to Tigerdirect. (They ship overseas but no returns.) I bought this player to enjoy movies while I travel. It is too big for just music. Every website I try that works with Creative Zen Vision W to download movies is not allowed to download in Kuwait. Nothing!!! So I tried to add one of my DVD's to it and no, it doesn't work. I tried software to convert it so it will go on my player. And no! Please someone help me! I admit I am new to this and work 12.5 hrs 6 days a week so my time is limited to mess with this thing. THANK YOU for any advice. :)"
4,?Compatible with Unbox?,"I haven't been able to get Amazon's Unbox player to recognize it, so I can't transfer Unbox movies to it, which is the main reason I wanted it. Amazon Help recommended downloading a fix from Microsoft, which I did, but that still didn't correct the problem. So it seems the problem is more with Unbox than with the device. Otherwise I have no particular complaint about this product"
5,Outstanding Product,"Creative has done it again. This is my first experience with this sort of Device. I am extremely pleased. Off hand, the only suggestions I have would be the addition of a dock, and a better screen to protect the permanent screen. Other than that, I highly recommend this model to anyone seeking this sort of device."
4,Excellent Device,"What an excellent device. I can't believe I have waited this long to purchase this media player. I have been using a 60 GB video iPod for the past year and this thing blows it out of the water. The screen is crisp, bright and gorgeous.Pros:ScreenSoundScreenEase of useScreenEase of loading music and videosBattery LifeStandard USB 2.0 cable to syncCF Card readerCons:Size, but it's understandable....The screen makes up for the size.Very little accessories (Hard to find a good case)I will never go back to Apple. Unless they have a touchscreen 16:9 80gb with a CF reader."
4,product keep freezing,"this zen master w has the same problem like zen master m : freezing, keep freezing"
3,Where is the Software for Download,"There are plenty of the DVD transfer softwares for iPod and PSP, but no way to Vision W. As like a good Digita SLR Camera without a flash memory."
4,Great,"Although I bought one black Zen Vision W 60 GB, they send me white power adapter cable. The other things are OK."
5,Over 3 1/2 years & no problems!,"I completely recommend the 60GB unit - it holds my entire music library, my complete Outlook address book, reams of pictures and about 20 + movies as well as oodles of podcasts! I recommend DVDFab to convert video for the playback, as I've had no problems with it; and you get free upgrades forever.One of the smartest buys I've ever made. I've hooked it up to the TV and it works great. One hint: when you are converting video - hike the audio up a bit and you won't get as much 'hiss' on playback.Leave the protective film on the screen, this helps protect the big screen and is well worth not monkeying with it. I hook up the unit to my computer to charge up; and after 3.5 years I still get hours of playback time.Well worth the money. Good job Creative!"
4,Love It!,"I recently purchased the Vision W, and so far I have really enjoyed it. I've only had a chance to snyc my music into it so far, but I'm looking forward to adding movies and video's since that's 80% the reason I purchased it.The only reason I'm not rating the W a 5 is bacause of it size. I wished it could've been a little slimmer. And possibly another with maybe 80gb or so, 60gb is a lot but I would've been more comfortable with a little more.If your considering the W, I highly recommend it!!!!!"
4,CREATIVE ZEN W 60GB,I JUST LOVE THIS PLAYER IT IS SO EASY TO USE. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THE BATTERY CAPACITY IS NOT THE 14 HOURS ADVERTISED IT GIVES ABOUT 10-11 HOURS ON A SINGLE CHARGE. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AS A GOOD BUY
4,A lot of entertainment packed in one box,"I love this little box. I have been a fan of Creative Zen music players for a while (on my second generation now, the Zen Touch).The Zen Vision W has great screen resolution, sound quality and a nice software interface. I highly recommend this device for all around media play.I do wish it were easier to get movies on the darn thing, but that seems to be a factor beyond this device. Amazon Unbox downloads sync right up."
2,very disappointing,"After doing much research, I finally decided to purchase the Zen Vision W 60 GB and I must say that it has been very disappointing and frustrating. I have 17 GB of music on it and can't listen to it unless it is sitting still. Whenever the headphone jack is moved slightly, it shuts off and when I turn it back on it has to rebuild. It did this intermittently when I first got it, but now it does it more and more. The rebuild takes a few minutes. I just went outside to do some lawn work and tried to use it over and over again. Listen to a few notes of music, try to put it in my back pocket and off it goes - have to rebuild. Set it down, let it rebuild while I do more lawn work, go back and try it again and the same thing happens. The only reason it did not get one star is the screen is nice for pics and when it works, it is easy to use, but it is just rare for it to work for me.As much as I hate to say it, I might have to get an ipod."
5,great,this is a great cdi cant stop listening to itcouldn't believe I finally found this cdgreat buy
3,Average Read,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. It didn't contain as many layouts as I expected and its definitions of the cards were somewhat lacking in breadth. However, the book spoke in simple terms and broke down the cards into their suits and numbers so that their meanings were easier to understand. I learned the significance of higher or lower numbers predominating in a spread, as well as black or red cards. This book has added to my knowledge of cartomancy, but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
3,Must have a gift,The book is helpful. Although you must remember that a person needs to posses a gift in order to use.
4,If You loved Armageddon...,...Then I would avoid this movie. At least at this price...I admit I also worked on this film and haven't seen it all the way though. But what I did watch was rather funny. Look for the van that gets destroyed early on in the film... It shows up many times after that. As well as the steering wheels on the wrong side of the cars. Unfortunately (For me) I have worked on worse films ;)
4,A funny thriller satire on the Armageddon & UFO movies.,I must admit that I was involved with making this movie so this is not an unbiased opinion. It delivers a tongue in cheek thriller which takes on the big disaster movies and America's obsession with UFOs. Tom Wopat and Roxanne Hart were great and the picture delivers a lot of fun.
1,misslabeled,The description has nothing to do with the movis as listed = this is a documentary and does not have any movie stars appearing
1,This is not the George Kennedy translation,"This review is for the ""Readaclassic"" publication (check the publisher, not the title, descriptions, or reviews). This is NOT the George Kennedy translation. It's the W. D. Ross 1908 translation that is available for free on the internet. All descriptions and reviews on the Amazon page refer to the Kennedy 1991 edition, BUT THIS IS NOT IT. There are NO footnotes, NO commentary, NO introduction or preface, and NO way to cite the text. That means students can't use this version for research. Essentially, this publisher simply copied texts available online, pasted it into his own document, and ""published"" it without the usual publication data. I understand that Readaclassic is just looking to make a quick buck from someone else's labor, but I'm disappointed that Amazon.com is allowing con artists to flood the market with cheap, mislabeled fakes."
5,"Logic, human character and emotions","""Rhetoric may be defined as the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion"" (pg. 4).Logic, human character & emotions deep understanding are the key ingredients of Aristotle's receipt and, despite it was written quite some time ago, it will never be out-of-date for all of us who are involved into human interactions."
5,This was the ONLY travel guide we needed on our trip!,"This book is great for anyone going to Bermuda for their honeymoon or for a vacation. I found all the top beaches and my husband found exclusive details on all the top golf courses. With exact prices and candid reviews on hotels and restaurants, we were able to make a budget for the entire trip."
2,Very dissatisfied with this product,"This product is not for beginners. My son who is 8 received it for Christmas and played with it twice. On his third try, there must have been a slight tear in one of the blades on the bottom rotor because it shredded and took out the top rotor with it. The blades on the rotor are paper thin. The other problem is that you have to push the throttle on full to get it off the ground and then feather it back to bring the helicopter to a safe distance from the floor. If you crash and you are too high off the floor the blades tear and then it won't fly. It does not come with any replacement blades and they are ridiculously expensive. I ordered them on Christmas day and it took two weeks to get them."
1,frustration for all,"We have the two, of different frequencies. Neither one took off from the floor but whirled around and tumbled, regardless of the control trim. After a few trials one transmitter completely failed.(Removing them from the well-constructed and packed boxes required care which a child would need help doing.) Attempts to contact the company were foiled by canned email and telephone recordings . No one ever responsed to numerous inquiries. A wonderful engineering design, but much too small, delicate and fragile for children. Apparently not much quality control at the factory. Not recomended."
2,"Small, Easy-to-Use, Rotors break easily","This Helicopter is very easy to use, right out of the box it had enough power to keep it going for a few minutes and the controls i could master after a few days. It charges in under ten minutes and will go for about 2-3 minutes, the rotor speed control makes it easy to tweak the blades to make it go straight. The only problem i have with this is that the heli is very easy to crash as the two sets of rotors easily wobble and frequently clash with each other sending it to the ground, as a result the non-durable plastic blades will inevitably break fairly soon and even with tape they still it not fly very well requiring you to spend money on the replacements."
2,Beware; it's a tiny little book. With tiny information.,"This is a very little book with a cursory overview of the topic. It's deceptive in that it looks like a real book, but is just a cute little booklet."
3,Steel bowl,"Quality only so, so. It is no heavy nenough and has started to pit. Quite disappointed. I use it but it is not high quality."
2,Great bowl...but wrong size,"I ordered this to be a drinking bowl for my very large dog. A 3quart worked but was a little too small and we would have to change it out sometimes several times a day. The bowl came quickly but when I opened it up, it was a 4.5 quart instead of a 6quart. It's still a great stainless steel bowl and will work, but I was disappointed that I was sent the wrong size. Especially because I can't even find the 4.5quart in the same brand on here as if they don't even sell it."
2,metal taste,"I have noticed when I beat ingredients in it, or scrape the batter from the bowl with silicon spatula, the bowl stains the batter and leaves unpleasant metal taste. If you are into baking, I recommend that you whip eggs or mix batter without scraping the bowl(basically impossible!), do not let the batter sit in the bowl, and when you pour the batter in a baking pan, do not clean the bowl with a spatula to remove all the batter from it.This is a sturdy, nice bowl, but not suitable for making delicate baked goods."
3,"Decent bowl, except the capacity is wrong.","I should've listened to the previous reviewer. I'm not sure how these bowls are normally measured, but even though it claims a 6-quart capacity, in my tests using a liquid measuring cup, this bowl only holds up to 19 cups (4.75 quarts) before spilling over, which of course is an impractical level to fill a bowl. So 4 quarts is probably more accurate, and even then I'd be worried about mixing stuff over the edge depending on what's in it.In spite of this, I've happily used it to mix dough and fillings, and as part of a makeshift double boiler with a 3qt pot. It's a sturdy stainless steel mixing bowl with a flat bottom and a brushed metal appearance, nothing special. It doesn't have a rubber bottom like some brands, but you can always put a rubber mat or damp kitchen towel under it if that bothers you. Just make sure you aren't actually planning on putting more than a gallon of stuff in it at one time."
1,Not a six quart bowl.,"Although it says ""6 qt"" on the bottom of the bowl it actually holds just a hair over 4 quarts. I wouldn't consider this Amazon's fault, but the description is misleading. If I wanted a smaller bowl I would have ordered one."
4,"I'M CHEROKEE JACK, YOU SHOVE OFF","If you're familar with the name Coleman Francis - then you know what you're in for. If not, then be warned, Francis is to film what Jack the Ripper was to London Society. Hacked, cut and torn to peices, this is less a film but an orbiting selection of scenes built around one large man - Coleman Francis... and it hurts. But as luck would have it, the crew on the SOL make it hurt with laughter (awwwww). Packed with excellent jibs, jibes and jokes RED ZONE CUBA will not fail to make you laugh - this edition misses five stars simply because the cut scenes with the SOL crew are a little weak and will have you reaching for your fast faward (until it hits DVD - then you'll just cut to the next chapter), but never during the movie. If you can't wait until it hits DVD next year - or don't have a player yet - this edition on VHS is still a good time."
5,I'm Cherokee Jack!,"One of the worst movies ever, and one of the best MST episodes. A rambling, pointless plot, repulsive characters, glacial pace, and the vocal stylings of John Carradine make this one of the most hypnotically grotesque spectacles you'll ever see. A must for MST fans."
2,Eh,"I really like Mike, but this is one of the driest MST3K's i've seen in a long time. I think the really bad thing about this episode is the fact that this movie is just plain aweful. Yes, there are even some things the MST3K boys can't work with."
5,A Paradox on Which to Ponder,"It just struck me, the ongoing verbal critique of the MST 3000 panel aside: If this movie were remade today with an identical script, but; If its locale was changed to Iraq in the year 2003; If slightly more production values were invested in it, and; If it was entered in the Sundance and Cannes film festivals as an ""independent production,"" critics around the world would hail it for its ""deeply symbolic subtext"" and call it a ""cautionary anti-war tale, told through a surrealist's lens.""I'll place a bet on that one, dollars to donuts!It is just unfortunate that Coleman Francis suffered the unjust fate of making movies in an age when incompetence was called by its rightful name.With the right PR firm and slick advertising, he'd be a pretentious multi-millionaire ""auteur"" these days!"
5,The BEST Mike Nelson episode EVER!,"This movie is pure dreck, but Mike and the Bots are at their best when they shred it into what must be hundreds of hilarious jokes and references for our enjoyment. I am a long time MST3K fan, and I can assure you that this particular experiment is absolute gold! It is one of my episodes of choice for showing to those who are uninitiated to MST3K or ""don't get"" the whole Satellite of Love thing. This one sits on my shelf next to ""Manos"" as the best duo by both MST3K hosts. If you haven't seen it, or wish to aquire one of the best shows, it is well worth the price."
