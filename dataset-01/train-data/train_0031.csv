1,"Attention all moms, this book will make you mad!",If you are a mom don't waist your time reading this book. To Ms. Fisher we are just little women with little fingers. To her your self worth is shown by what job you hold in this world and being a stay at home mom is not one with much worth. We all know that men and women have different talents. That is why men are men and women are women. Boring book.
2,Untrue.,"I stand firm in my belief that both sexes contribute equally in nearly, if not, every way and aspect of human living and life. Women who think their sex race will one day conquer the Earth, or anything of that sort, speak, in my opinion, from an unfair stance. Obviously, that woman has not seen the many ways both man and woman contribute to life as we know it, and have known life throughout the history of humankind. Therefore, I suggest she take another look!"
1,"Poor writing and research, very weak.","As I was reading this book I felt the author's premise was downright silly. She uses biological research to make incomplete and overly simplistic arguments to support her view that women are superior to men. I think she misjudged the reading public in taking what she - or the publishers- thought would be a popular political/social position that would sell books, especially to women. Honestly, I felt this book was so poor that I was too embarrassed to put it on my bookshelf."
4,Alberto Villoldo,"I love Alberto Villoldo! His books are fascinating. He uses stories and exercises to illustrate what he is trying to relay. His books are very knowledgeable and his cd set kind of summarizes many of his books.His voice is so calm and pleasant, and the sincerity of what he has experienced and believes in is intriguing.The only thing I didnt care for about this set is some of it is taped during an actual conference with a public setting and in the first disc someone repeatedly clears their throat. Other parts of it are just his narration and much better than the publicly recorded sections."
5,Must have for Truman-historians,Every historian who's interested in Harry TRuman should have this books. It has entries about almost every aspect of Truman's life.
2,disappointing,"This movie was very disappointing though the best part of the movie was the great make-up effects on Downey, you could not even tell it was him except if you looked very closely you could see the Downey eyes and lips. The love scene was the best part of the movie."
3,Imaginary portrait of Furboy the goat beast,"Because I love Diane Arbus's photographs I hoped this film would be good. It was just OK. It was not about Diane Arbus as an artist much. That is too bad. I wanted a film about her as an emerging artist and all I got was a film about her falling in love with the dog boy from The Shining. Not bad, not good. 50%. !/2 & 1/2. Pollock and Basquiat were more along the lines of what I was hoping for. Oh well. Odd film."
5,Very Interesting,This is a wonderfully querky little film. I am interested in all things Photography and Diane Arbus is an interest to me. I definately recomend this film.
2,NOT really about Diane Arbus,"Being a photographer,knowing about Diane Arbus, and watching this movie after watching real documentaries about her, it is understood that this movie had nothing to do with Diane Arbus the person but the directors spin on a person who really exsisted but making up a story around her. The plot was somewhat slow, as was the romance between Robert Downey Jr and Nicole Kidman. Thankfully they did get her camera right. But thats about it. Over all, a waste of the money I payed for this movie."
2,My review of Fur. Read on...,"Another amazing performance from Nicole Kidman in an extremely flawed film. This was an interesting concept, but the screenplay is weak, and the characters and story are both underdeveloped. There is no depth here at all. You find yourself simply apathetic towards the people on the screen, and this is never good when the film under question is supposed to be a character study.There are a few things to admire in this film, but you just can't get past the feeling that much more could have been done to make this a better film. Robert Downey Jr tries his best to deliver a strong performance, and he does a decent job here...even though he is covered with hair from head to toe through half of the film. You can barely recognize him.See only for two reasons: Nicole Kidman and Carter Burwell's score, which is amazing. I may very well purchase the soundtrack."
4,oblique,"If anyone can play Diane Arbus, I think Ms. Kidman is the one to do it. This is the kind of movie one has to accept without intellectualizing, or the heart of it would be lost. Definitely a right-brained movie and worth my while."
2,To shave is to conquer.,"Disapponting. This hairy film uselessly battles the common fur-generated fears/attractions. It's the typical beauty-and-the-best dynamic, but with a solid representation of the art of shaving."
1,Modified my PC,"I started to watch this last night on my lap top, a message came up saying the DVD had to install something to play.Needless to say, I did not install the software.On the DVD case, in very small print, is a message saying this will happen.I have NOT tried this on my player and don't know if that will happen their."
4,Nothing to do with Diane Arbus,If you watch this movie without knowing anything about Diane Arbus then you'll probably enjoy it. But the more you know about the actual Diane Arbus either through her work or through books on the subject then you'll be disappointed with the film because it is a false protrayal of the Arbus. Frankly if the film maker had say used this title: Fur - A Portrait of Jane Doe Photographer then it would have taken care of the critics and still would take nothing away from the film.
3,"Very slow start, but an ok finish","If you don't know much about Diane Arbus, this imaginary fable may arouse interest, though it's not factual, warns the prelude. The whole thing is a weird love affair between the tortured housewife, Kidman, and her carnival freak boyfriend, Downey, who looks like Wolfman Jack. Was he real? We aren't told. The look of the film is its high point: gorgeous colors, wonderful set decoration that evokes a cleaned up 1950s NYC and a nicely evocative soundtrack. Too bad this didn't try to get closer to reality. Then, the two hours spent might seem more worthwhile."
1,Where's Diane?,"This film made me sad at the squandered opportunity to have shared with a new generation and a larger audience an immense American talent in visual art through the medium of photography. Rather than grapple with a complex woman in a transitional cultural time for both women and the arts, we are given this water color of a woman, dropped in the middle of a Tod Browning carnival of 'Freaks,' trivializing Arbus' groundbreaking sense of vision and boundary-challenging subject matter. What a terrific actress like Nicole Kidman could have done in bringing us the raw, authentic artist and woman had she not signed on to this 'imaginary portrait.'"
1,Beauty and the beast,"""Beauty and the beast"" by a director that wants to be David Lynch. Human beings don't act like human beings. It's all about a sense of weirdness, and any resemblance to the historical Diane Arbus is entirely coincidental. And that's a pity because her life was interesting"
2,Ummmmmm???,I just don't see a person can shave a man who looks like a werewolf with a single little plastic razor. Not that this movie is poorly acted...but...IT IS SOOOOOOOO STUPID!!! It is also boaring. Dis I mention that this movie is stupid and baoring? Sheesh...what on Earth were Downey and Kidman thinking when they sighned on to make this easily forgettable film.
1,Insulting,"What an insulting fantasy of Diane Arbus. How could they get away with this trash with Arbus' name attached to it? I wanted to know more about the woman and her career as a photographer. You will not find this here. What you will find is just a plain ordinary ""Beauty and the Beast"" story that could have been about anyone. Why make this with Arbus in mind when any Jane Doe character could have done? Terrible. The only good side is that Nicole Kidman is always lovely to look at, but that's about it. TC"
4,Cars,I got this for my 4 year old grandson. Cars is one of his favorite movies and he instantly took to it. I recommend Leapster products for all young pre schoolers. My grandaughter was very advanced when she started school thanks to Leapster.
1,Inappropriate and violent,"I was shocked when my almost-4-year-old began playing this game! Mater the tow truck has to dodge machine gun bulllets from the car chasing him! This is completely inappropriate for young children! Exposing kids to gun violence in video games so early (or at all!) is part of a growing problem, especially in light of the recent school shootings. I was appalled that an educational toy would feature a game with machine gun violence. I had to take it away from my son and say goodbye to my $20."
3,Cars Leapster game,"My son is 3 and Loves cars, I thought he would love this game but it is a little hard for him. He looses interest really quickly. I thought there would be some fun games othere than just racing or driving a car but that is basically all it does. Not my best purchase, especially for the price."
5,Son can't put it down,"I had purchased this game two years ago when I bought a Leapster for my then 4 year old daughter for Christmas. My son at only 2 1/2 at the time started playing around with the Leapster and this game. Of course, given his age at the time it was a bit hard for him, but he figured it out pretty fast, which amazed me. He is now 4 1/2 and this is still his favorite game to play. Very educational, which is what I love about the Leapster in general. I could greatly recommend this game."
2,Not Much To It...,"My son received this game for his 5th birthday and had completed it in under a week. He loves the Cars Movie, so he still plays with it occasionally, but it is a repetitive game with little educational value. It's not even challenging for hand-eye coordination because you can ""win"" without much movement at all. For example, if you don't touch the controls your car will not go off the road, even when going around turns. It has the characters and voices that you love, but not much else. The ""Kindergarten"" cartridge lasted much longer in terms of educational and entertainment value."
2,Not a good choice for my child,"I have a 3 year old son and he has the longest attention span I have ever seen in a young child. He has watched full movies since the age of 1 and I bring him to the theater all the time and he doesnt move until its over! Also, he LOVES to play games on my phone or watch older kids play xbox. Thats why I thought this would be perfect for him, i was WRONG! The game held his attention for about 15 minutes at a time and he wasnt interested at all after about 3 days of it. It wasnt the console, that works fine..it was the games. There isnt much to do on them and they get old very fast!!! Considering each game is $20-25, it would cost a fortune to buy a lot. I HIGHLY recommend getting a used console or trying out a friends before buying because I wasted a lot of money on this. It may be good for some kids but every kid is different."
4,"Nice, but.... enough of the trick photography!","Okay, granted, this is probably one of the best books I've seen on make-overs, but once again I am disappointed by the comparison before and after pictures. The techniques presented herein are excellent and do really enhance a woman's beauty, so why resort to the old photographic trickery of presenting horribly exposed and flat &quot;before&quot; pictures to compare against professionaly lighted &quot;after&quot; pictures? As a professional photographer, I want to see a real side-by-side comparison of applied makeup in the SAME lighting conditions. It would be much more helpful.Again, though, this is still an excellent book."
3,OK,does what it's supposed to do. But dont like the material on the front for the forehead. I get DIRTY FAST and is not easy to clean.
4,hardhat suspension,"This is a good suspension system...I like the ratchet tightening, the sweat band is like a terry material & cleans easy. This one came with the chin strap to keep your hat on but I've never used one so can't comment on comfort or ease of use. Thank you for speedy shipping :)"
5,One of my most favourite books.,"Four years after the end of the civil-war, Andrew Stone is treated like a traitor in the city of Huxley, Texas, because he fought for the Yankees. To make things worse his ex-wife Damaris spreads lies about him all over town. Andrew has a young daughter from his first marriage. To secure her a place in the society of Huxley he decides to marry again. He chooses Margaret. She is not beautiful but very respected. Although Margaret is a bit afraid of the Yankee she agrees to marry him to get away from her awful aunt and to give her sister and brother a better life.I like this book so much because there is not this constantly fighting between the hero and the heroine. There are no big misunderstandings. The story focuses on the growing love between the H/H and how the hero learnes to trust a women again. All in all a very sweet love story."
5,The Yankee,This is a great read and involves you in the story right from the beginning. I have reread this book many times and still love it!
5,The best Trollope ever,"having read all her books so far this is the best withiout a doubt. This book shows an unbeleivable insight into the lives of how the people and relationships in divorce situations are affected. It makes me wonder if she has been through it herself and what's more, seen it from all sides!MUST READ"
1,Joanna Trollope Fails to write an intriguing novel,"This author was highly recommended to me by a friend with whom I share many similar reading tastes. Imagine my disappointment when I had to force myself to finish this book.The characters were not likeable and I could not care about them. Only Hillary evoked any sympathy from me. Gina and Sophy and Lawrence and Fergus all left me cold. I cannot imagine a group of more unlovable characters all assembled in one novel. How could anyone feel for the spoiled, self-centered, uncaring Gina? And how did she become this way? She certainly did not grow up pampered and her mother Vi seems to be a caring person. Lawrence came across as dim-witted and totally controlled by his feeling-of-the-day. Because I could not care about these characters, I could not care about the repercussions of their adulterous shenanigans and will not be inspired to read anything else by this author."
3,Readable,"Not one of her best, but OK. Her characters are well presented and believable except for Gina who is rather exagerated;"
3,I can't decide......,I thought this book had a slow start but I did get in to it after about 30 pages. I don't think that the stories were always developed in it. I agree that the characters were selfish but that is how people can behave when these things happen. It was worth reading but I don't know that I would recommend it.
2,"Another ""Poor little Women"" novel....","Gina and Lawrence are the main characters of the book. The were best friends in childhood and that friendship continues into adulthood. Both are married to other people and when Gina's marriage ends she ends up in at Lawrences house being comforted in his arms. His wife is somewhat understanding but feels that Gina often outstays her welcome. Gina goes through every ""poor me"" emotion from the divorce and it gets obnoxiously annoying! Will someone please write a book where the betrayed women moves on and becomes strong without having to virtually distroy her teenage childrens' lives too?!!!I won't go into detail of what happens next in case you decide to read this boring novel but let's just say that it's predictable, yet boring, with no really likeable characters. Very flatly written! I give it 2 stars..."
4,Modern Literary Uzbek,"My husband and I ordered this book to get a start on learning Uzbek on our own. We are just getting started, but have found it to be helpful. We have never tried learning a language on our own before, but we studied Arabic in college which has been helpful. The editing could definitely be better, and it would be nice if it was in the Latin alphabet instead of the Cyrillac since that is what is officially being used in Uzbekistan now. The lessons are available to listen to on the internet, which a major reason why we choose this book. How else are you going to learn Uzbek living in a small Idaho town?"
4,Cole Porter Soars,A brilliant album of Cole Porter's best. One of the reasons his music is timeless is demonstrated clearly by the musicians in this album.
2,The Vice Season Two a disappointment,"Season One of The Vice was just terrific. Good writing and, of course, Ken Stott is a fine actor. But Season Two moves like molasses, certainly the first two episodes. Endless, dragging, repetitive, no action. The writers sadly appear to have let the series down. Here's to hoping they regain their initial touch."
4,Get it!,"Sir James George Frazer (1854-1941) was a Scottish anthropologist; and this book, originally published in 1890, as the two volume, ""The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religions"", his best known work.A short example of his writing style follows:""On Midsummer Eve people in Sweden""make divining-rods of mistletoe or of four different""kinds of wood, one of which must be mistletoe. The""treasure-seeker places the rod on the ground after sundown,""and when it rests directly over treasure, the rod""begins to move as if it were alive....""(pp 367, with reference notes at the bottom of the page.)This particular edition is the only unabridged, and illustrated re-printing of the classic, and while some modern scholars refute some of his conclusions, it is a Must Have for any student of folk-lore and magick."
4,The Golden Bough,"Frazer's Golden Bough is a thorough study of mythology, and the hero. I read it once before, and reviewed it with a plus. It is one of thouse books that are timeless. As true of it's subject now as it was then.I recommend it.The Illustrated Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion"
3,Classic work but not great work,"A classic, Frazer's ""Golden Bough"" has been read by a few generations of scholars. However, Frazer's almost mythology standing as one of the first mythologists in Ancient History has led to an over-evaluation of some of his work, in my opinion. Written in ramble manner only confuses the reader and weakens Frazer's arguements so that one may find it difficult to argue with specific passages. By the end, it seems that Frazer has gotten lost in his ""search for Ur"" and forgotten that his assumptions are meaningless until proven by text, records, and logic."
2,Dated,"This is NOT the foundation of modern anthropology. The reader from Oregon is absolutely right. It was considered a great work but is no longer held in such esteem. The idea that societies progressed from magic to religion is outdated. As Mary Douglas said, Frazer led comparative religion into a blind alley. Read something written in the last century if you want a real anthropological veiw."
2,a little hard to read,i bought this book to study about the mythology found in the Bible. bibilical critism is a much better source for my purposees.
2,Overpriced. Better versions of this classic work are available,"The Summit Class Press edition (Look at the copyright page in ""See Inside This Book"") contains the complete text of Frazer's own abridged version, but surprisingly this relatively expensive edition doesn't contain an index. I returned my copy to Amazon and found a used Macmillan Publishing version that not only has an index, but which I think is a more attractive volume as well.Though Frazer's abridged version dispenses with scholarly footnotes, an index seems vital for a book that will almost certainly be used as a reference. I can't imagine what Summit Class Press was thinking by issuing a copy of The Golden Bough without an index."
5,Bitter-sweet,"This album is really good. It is a definite buy. Musically, it is a great album, the Boss adds elements from Native America to the already wonderfully performed music. The reason it is bitter-sweet is the undertones of the lyrics are reminiscant of the tragic events of 9/11. In a recent interview with Ted Koppel, Bruce restated that fact. When you listen to this album, be prepared to be rocked, but also be prepared to feel the emotions that Bruce put into the beautiful lyrics. Also, the special edition is well worth the extra money!"
4,Pretty good,"My husband is a huge Springsteen fan so I get to listen to him a lot. This album has great lyrics but if you are a die hard, long time Springsteen fan, a lot of a music on this album is very different from all of his other albums. It's worth purchasing - - just don't be surprised if it doesn't sound like you might expect based on other Springsteen albums you own."
3,Bruce no longer hip,bruce is trying hard but he has little to say anymore out to the pasture you sawed off jersey slum denizen!ud
5,The best from the Boss,"Rock music has had a problem dealing with adult themes of lost love, as opposed to adolescent ""my baby don't love me no more"" themes. That is, rock music had this problem until Bruce Springsteen hit his stride. I had previously thought that ""Tunnel of Love"" was the best and most mature album that the Boss could create. I was wrong. ""The Rising"" is his best work ever -- and that puts it among the best rock albums ever. It's certainly the best that I've heard in a long time."
1,"War, slaughter, slavery, cannibalism and absorption.","1) The mechanism of natural selection among human beings:""the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct""2) The way natural selection operates:""Extinction follows chiefly from the competition of tribe with tribe,and race with race. (...) when of two adjoining tribes one becomes less numerous and less powerful than the other, the contest is soon settled by war, slaughter, cannibalism, slavery, and absorption.""Make no mistake about it, all I did here was to distill the ""formal"" hypothesis from a book that's supposedly science. By the quotations above from this book, Darwin's version of Natural Selection theory stands or falls."
3,Thought police,"Darwin operated in a thought world completely unacceptable to the ""politically correct"" speech/thought codes found on most college/university campuses today. If one subscribes to Darwinian or neo-Darwinian ideas, one has to wonder what new ""great ideas"" we are missing out on today, now that the politically correct thought police have taken over the media, education, and popular entertainment establishments--effictively suppressing the sort of thought that nurtured Darwin's ""scientific"" speculations."
1,Natural Selection among people,"----------- -----------1) The mechanism of natural selection among people explained:""the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct""2) The way this encroachment until extinction occurs among people:""Extinction follows chiefly from the competition of tribe with tribe,and race with race. (...) when of two adjoining tribes one becomes less numerous and less powerful than the other, the contest is soon settled by war, slaughter, cannibalism, slavery, and absorption.""3) The morality of Darwinism:""The highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognise that we ought to control our thoughts, and ""not even in inmost thought to think again the sins that made the past so pleasant to us.""1,2,3 those are the main things in the book in my opinion. It fails on standards of systemacy, abstraction, exactitude, verification, logic/reasoning, neutrality and formalising of theory."
2,Awful edition,"I cannot comment on the book because I didn't really read it. The edition is awful. The original long footnotes are embedded (between brackets) in the text, so the reading becomes a hard, rather impossible, exercise. I got lost at the tenth page."
1,No illustrations!,"This edition is labeled as illustrated, but where the illustrations should be, there are only the captions.This review applies only to this edition, not to Darwin's work itself."
4,Darwin's knowledge,"I always wanted to read this book due to its intriguing title, thinking that it would address the very issue from the begining. Conversely, 90% of the book is about birds, animals, fish and other organisms...It gets very biological towards the middle and really detailed with birds...No matter how dissatisfied you are with Darwin's work you still have to read it. Analogous with an Al Pacino movie, even if it's not a good movie you will still be interested in watching it...All in all, it's worth spending the time with the option of quickly flipping through the birds chapters!!"
3,A bit too impressionistic,"This biography is a must-read simply because it is by Sandburg and thus a thread of the national literary fabric. However, Sandburg tends to fictionalize or fill in the blanks of Lincoln's boyhood to the point where it sometimes becomes embarrassing. The narrative picks up speed and credibility, however, when it gets to the documented period of Lincoln's life; and ironically, the folksiness now works in its favor by evoking a very human and real portrait of Lincoln, unlike the current revisionist history drivel about his being gay, manic-depressive, or pro-slavery."
5,Lincoln biography par excellence,"After searching for the quintessential Lincoln biography to read, as my introduction to studying this fascinating man, I settled on Sandberg. He was a great pleasure to spend several weeks with! Even though we know this book was completed in the 1930's it is so well written and held up by so many academics and scholars as quintessential. It is true masterpie. Many more, hundreds in fact, books have been published as biography since Sandberg but his alone provides the understanding and genesis of how Lincoln came to be Lincoln.America (2008) is searching for the next Lincoln: revered on the right and the left, revered in the center, revered on the political fringes, we need a leader, statesman, collaborator, bold leader today more then ever."
4,Helpful information but a little full of itself,"Overall a good picture inside the New Home Selling business. Their advice is good but much of it is common sense. Several areas of the book, especially the demand that your Real Estate Agent must own a copy of their book or the last chapter that openly pushes you recommend your family and friends buy the book, are self serving and detract from the spirit of the book that they are looking out for your best interest. Other than these few areas where the book drops to the level of self interest, I found the overall content to be good and the look inside the industry extremely helpful for anyone considering buying a new home in a developed community. A must read for first time new home buyers."
3,Missing vital piece of info for existing homeowners,This was a good book with a lot of valuable information but was missing the one thing I was looking for...how to buy a new home when it's contingent on your existing home selling. I've visited many new home communities that didn't want to give me the time of day when they found out I had to sell my existing house in order to purchase a new home. I had hoped the authors would have discussed the options available for the many people in my situation.
4,Early impressions,"I've had this book about 4 weeks now, and I highly recommend it for intermediate to advanced users. There's a selection of around 30 tutorials which are concise, easy to follow, and, at the same time challenging. They're also just entertaining to do. I found each one introduces some new concepts, or techniques, that I might not have seen before. The print quality and illustrations are first class, too. The CD contains all the lesson files, sample movies, some excellent AW tutorials, and some plug-ins.Maya produce their own set of excellent tutorials, but all the tutorials in this book represent a fresh approach. I mean, they're not just a re-worded version of a maya tutorial.I hope other readers will enjoy this book as much as I do."
1,Very week book,How this got printed I dont know. Wish I could have seen samples of the tutorials before I purchased online. (...)
3,Very Nice,"This book is a Maya equivelent of those little books of daily wisdom. Each chapter is less than 5 pages, but is a nice refresher for those of us who are pigeoned into doing only one thing in the industry. If I were starting out this is the book I would get, and as an industry pro I like the simplicity of the tutorials because they opened a dialogue between my skills and practices."
2,Just some samples that not much appreciated,"The book just presents some solutions for specific tasks which partly are similar to what the book from Alias/WaveFront said. The book is suitable for not beginner, but advanced people who knows functions and feature of Maya very well. I disappointed with the book."
5,Nice Book!,"Buy it if you wanna learn good to pro tricks for Maya 4.Very clever design , read it in one weekend and took me 2 days to implement all examples from the scratch (not importing projects from Cd-rom , imho the best way of learning).The author spread his studies through 4 areas (animation , modelling ,dynamics and rendering).Rendering is by far the best one with really smart ideas for professional-look scenes.Animation area lacks ""human maneuvers"" maybe because today every animator is considering ""human maneuvers"" is for ULTRA-EXPENSIVE capture motion devices.Dynamics pretty good , but some of them are available in some websites.Modelling , well for me who works with Autocad/Shade/DesignCad since early versions (yes long time ago) this chapter didn't add so much but its really cool for people who is start to work with modelling now.Sorry english is not my main language.Jorge Faria"
1,Not for anyone with ANY experience.,"No one with any experience will need this book. I returned it the day I bought it because it was simply too basic. None of the 30 ""problems"" in this book are problems at all, and can easily be solved with a brief look into the Maya manuals or help files (press F1), or even a quick look online. Problems this book covers include ""how to make rigid bodies fall onto a passive rigid body"" and ""how to make a volcano with particle dynamics"". Those aren't the actualy book titles, but those are the topics this book covers, and they are not difficult at all. The volcano doesn't even look that good, anyway. This book is simply too short and too basic to reccommend. I suggest Maya 4 Fundamentals instead."
4,Just What I Wanted !,"Car-I-Oke ChristmasI've been looking for Christmas music that didn't require special equipment to background the singers, and this is perfect for the car!We've sang along with the grandkids and it's a lot of fun.Thank you for making our holiday that much better!"
3,Good clasp not the best but works.,Good item as a decorative clasp. As a security device not so much. It breaks with a few good hits. If all you are looking for is something decorative this is what you want. As for security and not looks buy another clasp.
2,A comparison of two books...,"I purchased both the Princeton Review and the Kaplan GRE 1999-2000 edition book. I found that while the Princeton Review book had some good pointers, the Kaplan book was better organized and a lot easier (for me at least) to study from. If you're only going to buy one book, I'd suggest passing this one up and getting the Kaplan book.What really sold me on Kaplan was the fact that they divided up their list of vocab words into categories, instead of one big list."
2,"Contains some helpful ideas, but carelessly prepared","Lots of typo's, even on test questions, which is a real problem when you're practicing for a standardized test. Also, give advice about problem-solving strategies, and then later on in explanations for practice questions, fail to follow their own prior advice! This seems to be a review book that was quickly and carelessly thrown together. Admittedly, some helpful advice and strategies are given in the book."
1,infested,"the software has all kinds of problems- see Beer's review. also, the author admits that this book and cd-rom CANNOT USE ACTUAL TEST QUESTIONS- only ets can- and recommends that you buy ets books and software as well. don't waste your money on this"
3,Scores remained the same...,The book gave good tips and ideas however the vocublary list that the book gave wasn't very useful. I study the words and learn many of them but most did not appear on the GRE.
2,I AM NOT AN AGENT,"A robot named Golem (Richard Young) has been given a hit list. He also knows all the people in the agency. In order to kill the robot and retired agent is brought back out of retirement (Robert Conrad as Henry Stanton). He believes he is protecting the flirty Mary Casallas (Karen Austin) from some rouge assassin. When he finds out it is actually a robot, he punches everyone around him, like a scene in ""Airplane.""The movie reminded me of a low budget made for TV ""Terminator"" knock off complete with the roommate of Sarah Connor. The ending was a bit comical and I never did understand the twist they suddenly tossed in. A real yawner for a science fiction action film."
2,Andy Williams in concert 2006,"I love Andy Williams but I was really didn't enjoy this DVD. The picture quality is not good and the entire thing is in Black & white. I assumed that if this DVD was just released in 2006 that it would be a good quality DVD, but I was very disappointed. I really wish I had not spent my money on this item; I feel it was a waste. I have many Andy Williams DVD's and watch them regularly, however, I know I will never watch this again. Even if you like Andy Williams, don't waste your money on this DVD."
4,Chamberlain 78lm Multi function control panel,"this is so woorth while in getting for the garage door opener. has a nice big key pad, you can lock out the controllers outside. and you can light up the garage,,all from 1 site. very helpful with the kids,,,i have gotten one before and someone liked it so much they "" took it""...so here i am to buy another one,,i got it the other day,,put it up in less than 5 minutes..."
4,Security+ Review,Great product...It was easy to install...I purchased this product to replace a defective wall control panel. It was a perfect replacement.Thank you Amazon...
3,Garage door opener - wall mount,"Needed to replace a difficult ""switch"". Not too difficult to install, directions however are poor. Had difficulty restoring the faceplate."
3,its ok,"Its a replacement, not nearly as good as the one that came with the unit. WHen installed the light up button did not go flush with the unit, I have to really press it in one specific spot for it to open the garage door. Good news, the object works I just wish you didnt have to push the button so hard to get the door to open."
5,LiftMaster Control Panel 78LM,Bought as a replacement for my original that had a broken button. Installed in minutes and worked right away.
2,"The title of it being ""Christian"" is a Misnomer","While there are many good entries, I was disappointed to see several pages relating to Malcolm X, obviously not a Christian and only name recognition for Pastor Tony Evans. The Winan Family was not mentioned although a comment made by CeCe regarding Andrea Crouch was included. Also absent in length are Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver and Ben Carson all Christians who have contributed greatly. I actually considered purchasing this as a resource for our home education. I borrowed it from the library first to review it. I think I will return it and leave it there and perhaps borrow it again if there are no other resource available."
3,Not too bad,"A bit slow in areas, but exciting in others. It also has the first appearance of Indy's Webley revolver."
2,"formula reading in the ""hardy boys"" tradition","Although MacGregor craftily weaves in a bit of historical facts to entertain, they are extremely general. Otherwise, the book reads like a Hardy Boys novel, deserving little attention from the adult audience. The novel works as a young adult novel; however, it seems marketed as more of an adult novel"
5,Indiana Jones and the Dance of the Giants,"I am a 62 year-old kid who can't get enough of Indy (young or old, and whatever comes next). MacGregor's, Dance of the Giants is well written, with plenty of history,archeologial sites and adventure to suit me. That is, of course, if one can really have enough adventure. These little stories read very fast, so I try to read them slow and savor every page. I highly reccommend the Indiana Jones Series of books."
3,"""Dance of the Giants"" could be bigger.","This was much better than the first in the series, ""The Peril at Delphi"", but here's the thing: you must read all of these Indy books in the order they were written - at least as far as Rob MacGregor's titles go. They definitely follow a storyline.""The Dance of the Giants"" refers to Stonehenge, which is actually linked to Delphi (according to MacGregor), and both linked to Merlin the Magician. MacGregor does a good job joining the two stories together, but it seems two separate books were unnecessary; they could've been one whole novel. Then again, I can't blame the guy (or Lucasfilm for that matter) for wanting to sell more books."
4,A pretty good adventure novel,Overall this is a well written and pleasingly paced novel. It supplies the reader with a good dose of Indy's cleverness and charm while creating a mostly engrossing journey. It does drag in parts but overall this a good addition to the Indy universe.
3,Mediocre Adventure...Ok for just passing some time,"This book takes place approximately 10 years before the movie series begins. Indy has just started teaching at the University. His field skills are still in their initial phases. That being said, the book does an OK job of presenting an Indiana Jones adventure. The characters, at times, were a bit confusing. However all of the basic Indiana Jones elements are there...bugs, fights, bad guys, mysterious myths/legends, and romance. The writing style lends itself to a very quick read. I was able to read the entire book in under 7 hours (thanks to jury duty). Would I read any more of the books in the series? Probably not. But, it did let me pass the time quickly and served it's purpose. Incidentally, the book is only $4.97 at Walmart."
4,A New Insight,This is a very interesting book which sheds new insights into the Sacrament of Reconciliation. I would like to recommend this book especially to priests and people who work in spiritual direction.
3,An ok book,The book is detailed but too general. Easy to understand but not in depth enough for understanding more advanced concept. The price is more than it worth
5,Llosa the obscure,"Murder In The TetonsMario Vargas Llosa writes like some auteurs make black and white films. Linear time is not important and the jump cut is used profusely, one brief scene from the past or future inserted in the middle of a contemporaneous scene. At first it is very confusing but after a while one must simply go with the flow and let the novel's projector run until the characters are sorted out and their stories told."
3,Difficult at first,First book I have read by Llosa and found it difficult to follow at first but once deeper into the story I was able to grasp his writting style with the continual back and forth through periods of time with the characters.
1,"Please give me one, just one character to hold -- just one.","I was unable to get into this novel. I gave it plenty of time and wished for the chance to enjoy it like so many others supposedly did. But, I found little."
2,The Green House,"Sorry, I cannot review this book, it is very hard to read. I went through about 70 pages and just could not get into it. So I put it aside and will probably come back to it at a later date."
4,herstory on bellydance,"Here is a fun piece of literature. The writer is engaging and takes her reader along with her on this tabla treasure hunt...every answer or discovery brings multiple new questions and adventures for the sleuthing...if you adore dance and you adore learning and adventures through time...knowing where, what our origins are...this is a great piece of work for you!Happy reading and happy dancing!"
3,"Good facts, but dry read.","I can see the author did do her research in an effort to be taken seriously in her account of the origins of ""Little Egypt"" and etc., but it is a dry read, does not flow. Still good to have on the shelf, but a bit disappointing."
3,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a book about the care, feeding, breeding and perhaps some history on the various horse breeds, and I was expecting photos. The care feeding and breeding information is there, but not much on the breeds, and what VERY FEW photos or drawings are included are ALL in black and white. The ONLY color picture is on the cover. This is probably why they don't let you see much from the Look Inside because people might not buy this book after they got to flip through it. I believe the information is helpful but it is sorely lacking in illustrations. We will keep it, but I would not reccomend it to anyone unless they are looking for a dry college text, or possibly an informational reference. It isn't a ""fun"" book by any means. My family is dissapointed."
1,WAIT WAIT WAIT,"I too have had problems with my ipaq! I have a toshiba 330CDS laptop, and i cant use the usb cradle, i thought usb was universal? When i called COMPAQ, guess what? They told me that my usb was not compatable with the piaq. I will need to wait to BUY a Serial cradle. Shelling out 500+bucks for a unit that Compaq will support the users. I am a bit peeved at the shortage from Compaq, hello guys its time to pull our heads out!!!"
2,Useless is right!,"The iPaq's been out since June and I happened to be one of the first on hand when CompUsa had it on the shelf so I eagerly snatched it up. I can use the USB at home but I also needed the serial cradles for NT at work. Yet here it is October and the serial port still isn't available! Three months and all I've got is a $500 digital grocery list. And what's with CE ver 3? No close button on the applications! I don't even use it now, what a waste of money. Should've been smart and returned it within 14 days. I still drool over the display of accessories for every other hand held out there..."
1,Why the shortage when the European models are shipping w/ it,why is there a shortage from Compaq for the Serial Cradles? and why are the Serial Cables coming out FIRST and charging you more ??A few people have gotten ahold of serial cables (i heard from Canada Compaq directly) what the heck ... the cables costs the same as the Serial Cradles..Plus I thought the European Ipaq are shipping with the Serial Cradles instead of USB ..
1,Unbelievable,"I finally received my iPaq 3650 today, whopee! However I realised that it is almost totally useless as I run WinNT and USB is not supported! So now I have to order and wait another six-eight weeks for the serial cradle. What a load of howee!"
5,one of a kind,"This is the one that started it all, all of what we have come to know of Keith's solo piano work is presented here in a somewhat abbreviated context, but one where every note counts, and there are none wasted. Incredible technique matched with beautiful melodic ideas, strong rhthymic energy, and supported by harmonies that seem otherworldly. All of this and more is Facing You, still one of my favorite Jarrett solo albums, along with Bremen/Lausanne and the recently released Carnegie Hall Concert( which I think is the best). Pianistically he goes where no one dared to go before and 35 years later, this music still has the daring and brilliance that other major artists still can only hope to aspire to.This album is one of a kind, as is Keith Jarrett."
5,distilled jazz,"After listening to the work Jarrett recorded over decades subsequent to this album, this music comes across to me as sort of a distillation of ""pure Jarrett jazz"".But of course that purity of sound no doubt comes from the fact that this is the music of Jarrett early in his jazz career. As someone pointed out no grunting. Also no free jazz, no atonal modern classical style interwoven into epic jazz improvisational compositions of concert length.Jarrett has produced a massive body of exquisite work over the years. But as is evidence from this album, he was already a master of jazz piano at this stage of his musical career."
4,I'm Still Here;Confessions of A Sex Kitten,"Eartha Kitt gave a very interesting read about her life,the part about her childhood was very disturbing and sad.I am sorry to read that she never found a man who loved her the way she loved him and could not spend his life with her because of racial prejudice and pressure from friends and relatives."
3,Earrrrrrrrrtha Daaaaaaaaaahhhhhling!,"Eartha Mae Keith (never explains how/when/why she changed her name to Kitt - unless I missed it) takes us on an incredible journey from her meager and abusive upbringing in the south to the chance opportunity in New York that jumpstarts her career and propels to her fame and fortune in the US and abroad. Sometimes I found myself not believing a word of what Ms. Kitt had written about her exploits in London and Turkey and wherever it was she found herself, but it made for interesting reading, nonetheless. She also seemed to be a bit stuck on her wardrobe at times, but I guess that goes along with the celebrity that is Eartha Kitt.I'm glad she talked about the event that all but ruined her career in the States and I'm not surprised at the chain of events that followed. Eartha tells her side of the story about her life, loves, and losses. A real treat."
2,What's Her Problem?,"I read this book and it's obvious that Eartha Kitt has a problem with being black. She claims that the reason they didn't show the movie she was in with Sammy Davis Jr. in the South, was because the racist Southerners might believe she was white. If Eartha Kitt thinks that she would be mistaken for white, then excuse me, but this is the Queen of England typing this review."
5,Breath taking!,"I want to congratulate each and every actor. The performances were impeccable! Watching my son ""Martel Huggins"" just blew me away. We must support Black films...its very important to keep our youth, and young adults lifted! Last but not least, ""Thank you"" Tiara Luten! Thank you for giving not just my son but all the actors a chance to display their amazing talent."
5,loved it!,"I enjoyed the soundtrack as well as the movie. The actors were sincere, and the message was sweet and true. Kudos to all!"
4,"Nice, but more coppery than I thought","I love the smooth texture of this light cream eye shadow, though it can rub off pretty easily (so it will quite possibly end up creasing).I was hoping for a bit more of a brown color, being that it's called ""Terra,"" but this coppery color really makes my blue eyes pop without being too overwhelmingly orange. Plus, it would probably look nice with copper jewelry. Not recommended for eyes that are even remotely bloodshot, though - not attractive!Though it may end up creasing, I really do like the feel of it and will more than likely buy more colors before it is sold out everywhere. I bought this one for $1 - nice price!"
2,not geared toward a very serious breakup..,"ok. so i got dumped. but do i need cosmo to tell me how to mend my broken heart? well any advise was welcome when i purchased this, but it turned out to be wasted money - as i should have and would have realized if i were in a more stable state of mind.as a previous reviewer noted, it is fluff. this is primarily directed at a girl who wasn't with someone very long, probably didn't have a long-term commitment and whose main objective is to stop sleeping with her ex.i admit there were a *few* bits of wisdom, but most of 'em are pretty logical and obvious. the rest of it i skimmed....overall, it's not worth your time."
2,Bubblegum,"If you are going through a divorce, are ending a long term living together relationship or are in deep emotional pain, this book is not for you.If you are in your twenties and have been dumped, then this book is for you.I think anyone over thirty, who has been in a long term relationship would find this book trivial and surface scratching. There was no content for a mature relationship that went beyond a few months to a year of dating.All of the advice in this book is pre marriage relationship based. It was a horrible waste of my money."
2,"Written for radio, should have stayed there, a waste of brilliant speech.","This radio play was never meant to be seen, only heard. Imagination and the theater of the mind, combined with the Dylan Thomas, Welsh vocalization, made it music to my ears. Rude, lewd, and boring it never was, till filmed. Even the actors knew this and had no pride in it."
4,Under Milk Wood Under Review,"I think Thomas's clever use of language is the thing I liked most about the book, which I first read years ago. and his humor: For example calling a place ""LLAREGGUB""(Read it backwards!) And his characterization is great."
3,Difficult to read,It's not an easy book to read or even refer to. But it does cover everything. Not for the faint hearted
3,Pleasant Musical-Comedy With Two L&H Scenes,"Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy add some box-office insurance to the musical comedy ""Pick a Star"" (1937). Producer Hal Roach creates an agreeable showcase for the talents of Rosina Lawrence, Patsy Kelly, Jack Haley, Mischa Auer and Lyda Roberti. No hidden classic but a pleasant diversion, with guest stars Stan and Ollie contributing two memorable sequences. Edward Sedgwick later directed The Boys in MGM's lackluster ""Air Raid Wardens"" (1943)."
3,Pick a star aka movie struck,"Well, I bought this movie to add it to my Laurel & Hardy collection...however this is in no way a Laurel & Hardy film. They make a cameo in this movie really. The movie overall wasn't bad. It was actually a pretty decent film about a girl dying to make it in Hollywood. I wouldn't recommend this movie to a Laurel & Hardy fan but if you like old movie classics you will probably enjoy this one."
2,Pretty thin stuff,The Laurel and Hardy bits are slightly amusing - the rest of the film is paper thin. Try to catch it on Turner Classic Movies. It's not really much of a film.
1,Battery Won't Last! DANGER - 90 day warranty!,"I have a PS-120A I bought about a year ago. I went to use it the other day and it said RECHARGE so I Recharged it. Immediately upon plugging it in it said CHARGED. So I left it in over night, unplugged it and pushed the status button, and it said ""RECHARGE"".I called Schumacher this morning, and after waiting 20 MINUTES on hold, was told that the battery was likely bad, and that the battery had only a 90 day warranty, and that if you don't charge the battery once a month every month it will discharge permanently and will become landfill like mine.CAREFULLY CONSIDER whether you want to purchase a Schumacher product. I asked if there was a trade in program, or if there is anything I can do, and they said ""Buy a new battery or buy a new unit"". Hardly what I would call stellar company support, and even though they charge a premium for their products, THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND WHAT THEY MAKE!!!My next jump starter will NOT be a Schumacher."
4,Jumps Thru Hoops,"I've been using a Mity-Mite for three years and have never had a problem until now. It won't charge. I've used it to jump my Toyota Tundra (V8) and Honda Civic when the batteries were deader than rocks. I've also jumped my riding mower, which is an accomplishment in itself since the stupid seat has to be down (on top of the battery - jumpers and all) to get it to start. Hopefully, my next Mity-Mite will work as well. I wish it had an attachment to blow up tires."
2,"For the price, should last a little longer...","This thing works great... for a while. We had no problems with ours for the first year or two. At this point, it's worthless -- doesn't charge any more. If it's a planned obsolescence thing, it makes sense to buy a cheaper one and consider it disposable... Or maybe we just got a bad apple. However, given that a couple of other reviewers have noted similar problems, I suspect that our experience isn't atypical."
2,poor construction for terminals,"Seems ok at first, charged fine as advertised. Used it 3 times in the first day i had it charged (lucky timing!) and the negative terminal connector flew apart each time. Had to reassemble each time and it still is shakey. Very frustrating in that attaching to anything of any size causes it to self-destruct. Now I've taken to just holding it on to something a la a defribulator and hoping for the best. Would not buy again."
1,broke the first time,"i wouldn't recommend this product. The positive terminal clamp broke in half the first time i used it... I, as I was stranded, rigged up a method to make contact with the terminal w/ the remaining half of the clamp. Then the charger (which was charged fully the previous night) didn't provide enough power to actually turn the engine over. I will be returning to the store tonight, returning this item, and purchasing a different charger."
4,A LIFE SAVER!!,"PROS: Inexpensive, compact and thoughtfully designed.CONS: No DC adapter, although there is a hole for an ad-on connector. no power cord and you need an extension cord to to fit in the recessed A/C port.RECOMMEND: Yes!PAID: $19.00 ON Summer closeoutCOMMENTS: I bought this to jump start my 1 ton Dodge RV after Winter storage. I've jumpped my 1997 GMC Suburban and various other cars/trucks and it performed flawlessly and I live in an area where sub-zero temps are the norm during Fall and Winter.It is not a flashlight, warning light, battery charger, air compressor or DC converter! But IT IS a decent jump starter at an affordable price!!"
1,Mity-Mite has all the power of a flea,"Bought one of these to jump start my 3.6 litre 911. It doesnt have the power to even turn it over once when fully charged. Complete waste of time, maybe it will start a lawn mower."
2,GREAT LITTLE JUMPER - BUT CONNECTORS ARE AWEFUL,"I own this little jumper and I am not very happy with it.Pros: You need to start your car... buy an orange extension outside extension cable, plug it in and charge it and it is ready to go.Cons: The negative jumper cable terminal ""flew"" off and broke after one use. I had it in my trunk and cannot find the darn little piece. As a result, I have a non-usable charger. The manufacture made such a stupid little piece and I cannot use this tool for what it intended for.As a result, I had to flag down another motorist and ""Ask for a Jump"". I will call the manufacturer to see if they can send me another lead.I will keep everyone updated on my service from the company."
4,A Good Product,"It is now 2012 and I purchased the product in 2007. It is still going strong. For the price it is a great product.I received it, charged it up, and went out and used it to crank up my lawnmower that had been sitting up all winter. She cranked right up. A friend borrowed it to crank up his KIA. The battery was dead. The KIA cranked right up without any problems. Excellent.The only draw back is that the positive and negative leads are very short (thus, 4 stars). When I jump a car battery I like to hook the negative lead up away from the battery to avoid spraks and a possible explosion from battery fumes. (It happens and a battery post flying through the air can mess up your day.) This can't be done with the Mity-Mite because (again) the leads are too short.For the price this product is an excellent value. It does what it says it will do. Apart from the short leads, what more could you ask for?"
3,Textbook,"This book was used as a textbook for one of my classes and I felt as though some parts were very clear, while others were very dense and difficult to follow."
3,A Semi-Forgotten Treasure,"Any serious student of Jazz needs to know about the Kansas City sound. The book reiterated what I already knew which is that KC was a major contribitor to bebop and to r&b due to the styles that came togteher from that part of the country. Generations of musicians were influenced by the Basie Band and Charlie Parker. You will also get an education of what life was like in the black community of a midwestern city. Kansas City, which happens to be one of my favorites among cities, had a parallel identity with the world of Negro Leagues baseball and both jazz and baseball are remembered through a museum which I plan to visit soon. I recommend the book to anyone unfamiliar with the subject and interested in jazz."
4,Stairway to MO,"Most undergraduate chemistry courses talk about MO, but they really don't care the audience. ""The rest is silence."" But this kindly written book by Jean, literally a student-oriented book, says not so much things, but we can talk about MO in effect. If you really want to know what your professor is saying in your chemistry class, this book is indispensable! Without mathematics, you can get the feeling for MO. Answer to excercise is a wonderful bonus, too."
3,Old school still throbs.,"Where was this when I was 16 with my version of a hopped up Chev 235? Now I want another one! Could use more technical and current resources for ""inliners"" to chew on. What there is, is invaluable. Found stuff in here I never thought possible. I hope some of the car magazine editors find this and do some current research and publishing. With the current price of fuel, maybe it is a 6's time to reassert itself and find new and practical application."
3,Doesn't seem to cover the late 50's 235 ci,"Chevrolet Inline Six-Cylinder Power Manual 2nd EditionI was kind of excited about this book when I first encountered it. However, it only mentions my 235 in the first two pages of the book. I know the basics of six cylinder technology would be common across all the models, but I was hoping to take my vintage 235 to new levels, but afraid that, when I got into the specifics of what was available for my particular engine, the book would leave me hanging. But, in all fairness, the cover doesn't list my engine as one it covers. So, oh well."
1,Rusted very quickly,"Didn't keep in my tank for long, as the bottom started to rust. Wasn't going to chance leaving any part of this plant in a tank with my beloved Betta."
5,Exquisite Christmas Music,"I have a collection of about 25 CDs of Christmas music and this is one of my favourites. The choir, all male, is in fine form, with an excellent group of trebles. The recording is spacious, but at a sufficiently high level that the splendid organ at St. John's produces a satisfactory rumble at high volume. However, it's the choice of pieces is what makes this album special. There's a mixture of traditional and modern carols, including two Welsh carols by Raymond Williams, which I've never found recorded anywhere else. These two pieces alone are worth the price of the album."
4,"Kithbook Pooka: I hate it (sorry, Kith Flaw kicking in)","Kithbook: Pooka is a wonderful guide to the shapechanging trickster of the Changeling World. However, it's out of print and the only copies I've seen are being offered for absolutely OBSCENE prices. It's fun, but unless you are a hardcore collector, it's NOT worth THAT much.Lobby White Wolf: perhaps they will reissue it on electronic media, if not paper"
2,Disappointed,"When buying my product, I was under the impression that it was a new book since it was listed under the ""new"" label. When I received the book, I could already tell that book's condition was not according to the ""new"" description. There were very noticeable bend marks where one would place a thumb at the edge of the book to leaf through it, and there were marks at the binding where the book had been bent. Nevertheless, I am pleased to receive it in great shipping time, but disappointed in its condition."
4,Larry's first historic comedy album.,"Ok, this probably isn't Larry's BEST comedy album, but it's up there. ""Lord, I Apologize"" is probably his best. So, if you don't have any Larry, start there. But after that, go for this one. It's now out-of-print, and tough to find. But it has many early jokes that Larry doesn't perform any more, so this is the only way to hear them."
5,MANLY ! ! !,"First off, the scent does smell familiar.That being said, its still great.Trust me I went to the mall and they Di Gio'ed me, spritzed me with the stuff. All it did was p... me off.I was stuck wearing junk for the rest of the day ,until I got home.If I wanted to smell like that I would have used my wifes bubble bath.Talk about GIRLY.Well atleast I know what to get her for Christmas!Anyways about this cologne,you wont have that issue here.Theres no mistaking that this is masculine, and who its made for.So if your like me, and you don't want to share your bottle with your wifey this should do the trick."
4,Core Fit,"I am a personal trainer and I thought this was a well-explained dvd. It is a good introductory dvd w/stretches, foam roller stretches and a few basic exercises to expand upon."
4,56K Pocket PC Modem,This is a very reliable modem. It is compact enough to fit anywhere and is in a not so annoying spot to have a phone wire in. It's great for presents. It's great for travel...even though it is only 56K.
4,to those of you that have this CF modem,"Can you tell me if it works with, or protecs your modem from, digital phone lines??? Does it have any surge protection? How is it better than the Xirtec CF modem? Please respond I am soon going to need to get a modem for my P/PC and want to get the best one and I have a IPAQ and don't know if I am better off sticking with COMPAQ products for compatability/warranty issues. thank you !"
3,"yes yes, very bitter","this is a promising debut. there are some very strong tracks, and some serious stinkers. definitely preview the album before buying. this is good, but not for everyone."
5,Daily Goldmine,"This book was among the best of daily readings I've ever read. The tips are short and to the point, and are useful for anyone--physically, mentally, and spiritually. M. J. Ryan has put together many useful books, and this is one which I will buy several for gifts. It's that good!"
3,Not configured for iPad Kindle,"The book is great, I also read from the author ""This Year I Will"", which is great.The problem here is that the kindle format, at least for iPad Kindle, does not work, either you use it as landscape or portrait mode the date number never coincides with the text of that specifc day. Some pages do not have a number, some have only numbers, it is a mess, i keep trying to figure out if what i am reading is supposed to be today's message........Buy the book, not the ebook."
2,Illustrations are totally missing!,"Even though on the sample page online Burgess refers to the beautiful and accurate illustrations of birds - they are completely missing in this edition! It was hugely disappointing and reveals a lack of understanding about the purpose of the book in the first place. The book was intended to be an introduction to bird identification and lore for children. It is not a simple story book - not at all! Burgess' entertaining and excellent writing, of course, remains.... I have no argument with Burgess - it is simply that half his material was left out of this publication without any notation in the description of the book that the illustrations had been deleted."
1,buyer beware!,"The ""search inside"" feature of this ad shows gorgeous, color photographs of the birds; HOWEVER, the actual book's photos are in black and white! Admittingly, the photos here are more accurate than Dover's older version's drawings, but you will still need to refer to another source for color photos/drawings. If you already own an older copy, don't bother with this one! If you are buying for the first time, you will appreciate the large, clear photos, but know that they are all in black and white.Spacing of the text is another problem I have with this publisher's version. The lines of text are too close together for easy reading. Dover's version is easier on the eyes."
1,No colored pictures in a child's book???,I was quite disappointed to see that this book has no pictures in color. How to explain to a child what the bird actually looks like!!!
1,Something's missing,"The written parts are the same as the older and original, but the most importatnt part is missing--no pictures. It is very difficult to have a bird identification book without pictures. Very disappointing."
3,small print,"this is the 3rd book I have ordered that has such small print, and it takes up the entire width of the page: I wish I had previewed better."
2,Book for Grandchild,"This version of the book was purchased because of the colored pictures. The colored pictures were not good quality, therefore, my daughter-in-law did not feel the cost of this version was worth it."
5,Well Done,I first read this back when I was a kid. TWB was excellent at writing for children about the natural world in ways that would make sense to them. I'm re-learning all about most birds and it's fascinating. Brings me back to my own childhood. I most of his books on my kindle now and read them when I don't want heavy things to read. Helps to keep me young and more understanding of the world around me.
3,redundancy is a crime,the book is okay but not one my top ten list. it is very redundant playing on the themes that reside in Duane's ealier books. for this book i would recomend going to the library and picking up a copy there before you get your own.
2,Wizard Alone,"The one good thing I can say about this book was that it got me interested in autism for about a week. If you're going to read a book about magic, try something by Tamora Peirce."
5,Beautiful Tenor Sax Playing from Joe Henderson. A Classic Album.,"This is a very special album. It is one of the best of Joe Henderson's many wonderful recordings. His playing on this album is just sublime; so expressive and yet restrained. This is a cd I shall listen to many times and highly recommend it to Amazon customers who seek a wonderful introduction to Jazz, or for those who, having liked Jazz for many years, want to hear Jazz musicianship in its highest form."
4,A fun ride,"As an adolescent I got this book from the library many times. I loved it! And now as a teacher I seek to have this book in my classroom. The imagery in the story is fantastic. The narration is extremely descriptive; you get the feeling you're there with them. While reading this book, one of my favorite elements was the relationship that develops between Tappy and Jack. I think that the problem that the reviewers had with this book is that they are not reading it through the eyes of the audience for which it is intended. I did, and loved it. I loved it enough to read it four or five times while in middle school."
1,American Garbage,"got this out of the bargain bin...should have left it there.It has an extremely short running time, which is a good thing, considering how boring and uncatchy the arrangements are.nothing for your money"
4,The Early Work of a Musical Genius,"I bought American Garage shortly after it was released. At that time, I suppose few people realized the musical force Pat Metheny (and Pat Metheny / Lyle Mays) would become. Especially in comparison to Pat's later recordings, American Garage seems a bit dated and perhaps a tad too influenced by jazz/rock fusion style prevalent at that time. Still American Garage is a remains an important work for two reasons: 1) this album captures a developing Metheny/Mays signature style which would thrill audiences and critics alike for the next two decades; and 2) this album exposed a legion of pop-weary audiences (particularly young listeners) to the possibilities of Jazz. If you were fortunate enough to catch any of the Pat Metheny group concerts during this period you know exactly what I mean.Pat Metheny has only gotten better, but if you are a serious fan, this CD is a must have."
4,One Of His Best!!!,"I have listened to Pat Metheny for almost 3 decades. I have found most of his earlier works a bit more interesting to listen to. The songs are more melodic and he didn't use all that guitar synthesizer sound nearly as much. Despite the recording and production of this CD...the songs (Cross The) Heartland, Airstream, and The Epic are among the best on this particuliar CD. Certainly, this will have to rate as one of Metheny's best!!!"
2,Where it all went wrong,"This record was a total disappointment and turnoff for me, especially coming after great, great records like Bright Size Life, Watercolors, and the first PMG record. Some of the compositions have their moments, but mostly this is pretty boring muzak; there's hardly any improvisation, inspiration, or edginess as there was on the aforementioned albums, just a reliance on cheesy new-agey compositions. This unfortunately foreshadowed stuff that I consider to be some of the worst music Metheny ever made, like Still Life (Talking)--totally dull and sappy music. Another factor that doesn't help this album is the muffled and unimpressive production. It just has no physical presence, crispness, or clarity. After hearing the first PMG album I was totally ready for the next record to knock me out. Instead, it was a total anti-climax."
3,Disappointing,"I've loved the Pat Metheny Group since my father played their CD's for me as a kid, and there was always something evocative about how they played. As I grew older, I also learned to appreciate the musical intricacies that Pat Metheny and pianist Lyle Mays can create when they compose together. This album, however, features less creativity or technical prowess than I would have liked, devolving into almost New Age music at times. Metheny and Mays have so much more talent than they let on here, and it's a shame that they released an album this boring. If you want an introduction to the Pat Metheny Group, I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,"5-star material, 1-star CD mix","This is a great album and I have owned it on LP and cassette. I wanted a CD because that is the medium of choice at home, work, and auto. I don't know what the deal is, but just about all the bass is mixed out. Not only is the bass guitar almost completely muted, but even the lower drums to some extent. I KNOW this is not how this album was originally mixed.I have heard this on 4 different systems. Did I get a bad CD or are they all like this?--scott"
4,Cool ghost stories with a(n Indian) Native American theme,If you like ghost stories and folklore you will like this collection. The author focuses on five Southeastern tribes. He gives a brief introductory history of each. While most of the stories were suspenseful some of the themes got a bit redundant. Also some of the stereotypically Indian sounding names started becoming cliché. It's an easy read and doesn't delve into a lot of anthropology or dry explanations.
4,An insight into the roller coaster ride,"This book contains a candid description of the experience of a manic episode and the social, career, family and financial devastation it can cause. I'm sure most bipolars will identify with Faye, and SOs of bipolars will get an insight into the illness that perhaps the rest of us don't always have the words to convey.It was very engaging. I put aside the other 3 books I'm reading just to see how things turned out."
2,Disappointing,"I read other reviews before purchasing this book, and had high expectations of Ms.Shannon's story. Once I began reading, however, I found her writing style to be extremely repetitive, with many sentences being paraphrased over and over again. This may be intentional, to reflect the confused state of mind during a stressful period in the author's life, but does not, in my opinion, add substance to the book or to the subject matter.Having said this, I have to mention that I do empathise with her story, being a bipolar patient myself. I just expected that a published book would have a higher quality of written English on its pages. Contrary to other reviewers' opinions, I kept having to put the book down as I tired of the writing style."
5,An oldie but goodie,I read this book when it came out in the sixties and I was delighted to find it used on Amazon so I could re-read it. It's one of the books that sparked my life-long fascination with all things Russian. It's a good look at Russian life (as seen by tourists) during Soviet times.
3,Great price but scratches easy,"This sink looks really good but it scratches very easily, because the surface is not made of smooth material, water spots shows up as part of the sink unless you constantly wipe it. The material is not right for kitchen sink. I suppose it's OK for light duty use such as a wet bar where look is more important than function. Other better quality scratch resistant black sinks cost a lot more, I would have given it two stars if it wasn't for the good price."
4,Ignore the poor reviews,"If you're a fan of axe-shredding and are curious to hear how fast it gets, this is your disc. No, Michael Angelo Batio cannot construct the musical masterpieces of Joe Satriani, but who can? Angelo is an okay songwriter in his own right (listen to the title track). Angelo and fellow fretboard wizard Shawn Lane are the world's fastest guitarists (faster than Paul Gilbert, John Petrucci, and Michael Romeo, and those guys are FAST). Not only is Angelo fast, but every note he plays is clear. You'd swear a machine was playing this music, but it's in fact a man. Amazing!"
1,Don't waste your money,"It's all very well somebody saying 'ignore ALL the poor reviews' but as the saying goes, there is no smoke without fire and I seriously could not recommend this CD to anybody who plays guitar. Speed guitarists have been around for years, Vinnie Vincent played in a similar way in the Eighties. All this guy is doing is playing scales as fast as possible, and if people are impressed with this kind of playing thats fine. But for me personally, it does nothing. I agree with the other reviews on the songs as well, they are poor."
1,The master of slop.,This is one of the most hyped up guitar players I have listened to decades. I don't recommend this album unless you're into robotic guitar playing with absolutely no feel. The songs are a joke as well. Just an all round waste of money really.
2,Scrappy,"I bought this CD after reading previous reviews, but must say that I have been very disappointed.This guitarist is nothing like any of the greats - Satrioni, Vai or Van Halen. All his music consists of is playing as fast as you can with absolutely no feel and no sense of direction. When the music does slow down it sounds like it's being made up ab-lib and is very scrappy and unoriginal. The songs on this CD also have no commercial value and are embarrassing to listen to."
1,Nothing new.,This album would have been good if released 20 years ago when shredding was the rage. Nowadays guitaring like this is a boring to listen to.
4,"Upbeat, a great addition to an eclectic collection",I saw this group in concert while visiting relatives. They are amazing performers and apparently have been doing this over 50 years. I bought CD's for friends and relatives I knew would be uplifted by this music. It's good stuff!
3,Marginal effort with a couple of highlights,"It's hard to go wrong with Maceo, Fred and a Hammond B3. But while this album doesn't disappoint it doesn't inspire, either. The production is slick, there's a couple of hired studio guns on hand, and it all sounds a little mailed in for my liking. No sweaty, gut-bucket funk here. Downloading ""The Chicken"" and ""Southwick"" from iTunes is probably all you need."
2,"ragnarok n roll!........hey, this isn't Gwar! where's somthing good?!","cradle of filth sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! almost as much as dimmu burger. these 2 bands are only listened to by weaklings and posers. ragnarok might be kinda cool if they didn't steal their name from a gwar album, but probably not. if Gwar knew, i'm sure that this lackluster band would be ground into sports drinks to be enjoyed by all of the scumdogs, and the scraps thrown to the worm. listening to this album reminds me of what it feels like to be almost angry. its fast and agressive, but the singer sounds like he used to be a woman and became a man through the wonders of modern medicine. but enough about that, the two reviewers below me, they probably have an Eve 6 cd in their rotation between dimmel burger and ladle of filth, and they sing along with LFO. pop rockers."
4,Best for getting in-sync to any PC with serial connection!,"This is a must have product for people who are constantly on the move and needs to get their IPAQ PDA synchronized anytime anywhere on any available PC with sync software. The connection is a little bit slower than the USB but it's tolerable, a 3 min sync on USB will take about 10-15 mins with the serial. But overall, I give this product a high remark!"
4,just what I ordered,I couldn't get enough at the store and it was a closeout item. I couldn't find it at any other store. Luckly it was still available on amazon .com
3,Interesting but unnecessary,"Assuming this device really measures all of that, and it may or not, then it's very interesting. But as a simple scale it does not function well. You cannot just step on and weigh yourself. Complicated procedures are required just to do that!One thing I often use a bathroom scale for is to quickly weigh a package for shipping by weighing myself holding it, then not holding it, and remembering the difference. On a normal scale this takes seconds. On this, it requires eyewear and patience."
4,Good blinkey set,"This is a good combo set. A decent back and front light. The red rear light is a little tough to get off the quick release, but provides good rear blinking at a close to 180 degree range.The front light has two settings solid on and blinkey on and off. The mounting mechanism is great and easily mounts on almost any size front handle bars. The actual light is very small yet highly visible. The downside will be when you have to replace the batteries, they're not standard AA or AAA. However, I expect they'll last for a really long time despite their small size.The front light I got in the mail did not work! It would only intermediately turn on. However, I RMAed the product through Topeaks website and they sent me a replacement very quickly with minimal annoying pointless questions. I simply sent the bad unit back to them when I got the replacement. I recommend this product."
4,Great Value,"Good quality lights for night riding.The headlight isn't really powerful enough to significantly light your way on a dark road, but is very compact and does the job in most situations. The mounting with a rubber strap make it easy to take the light on and off, but also does not adjust once the light is on. For those riders that will leave the light on their bike they might want to look at a different mounting mechanism.The tail light is also compact and VERY bright. For the price you really can't beat this combo..."
3,"Rubber ""bands"" perish quickly","Very easy to install, but in just over a month of constant use (it's now winter and I'm using the lights daily) the tab on the rubber ring which holds the rear light in place has torn away and the band on the front light is cracking around the locking lug.Great idea, poor materials."
4,Nice compact lights,"Very happy so far. My only disappointment was that the rear light didn't fit on my Topeak wire basket very well. It does work, but I wish it fit more securely."
2,unbelievable tale,"Everybody seems to praise Margaret Truman for using inside information on Washington to form her books. Well I'm sorry, but I don't think Washington works the way she casts it --- certainly not as bad. Hired CIA assassins do not go after newspaper reporters, and US Senators do not take orders from the President. The ending to the book has the cavalry coming out of nowhere to rescue our heroes just in time to wrap up 300 pages of ... boredom. This book lacks the tension of a good mystery."
5,Nice Utility Hybrid,"Best twenty-three dollar club I've ever had. Really though, this is a very high quality hybrid. At any price. Weights and such not really important unless you are less than a 10 handicap and anal."
1,I want the secound hand pc,"dear sir,I want the second hand pc. for configration in celron/p-III.please send me rate and configration for second hand celron & p-III."
3,Really Pretty,"Very vibrant colors and loved that they featured many lesser seen butterflies but these do not have a very strong adhesive. Seems to stick just fine to regular plain writing paper, but that is about it. Bought these to stick on goodie bags for my daughters birthday party and they were peeling all around the edges. The bags were basic paper bags with a light coating that my children or I have decorated with stickers many times. This was the first time we encountered any issues."
3,description incorrect,"Amazon sight states that this product if for exterior! Actual label reads ""not for wood floors or exterior surfaces"" Needed it for an exterior wooden sign. Somebody goofed on the Amazon description!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Lust for Life,"After seeing the exhibit, I was wanting to learn about his life - the book, LUST FOR LIFE is very good reading and interesting."
5,Such a great book.,I read this book long ago when I was in art school and something triggered the desire in me to read it again. I am loving it as much now as I did then. It gives some insight into the world that made Van Gogh who he was. The book is written with great understanding of the artist's work and conecting how that came from the world he knew.
5,Amazing book,"A masterpiece by Irving Stone. You admire this book more if you have seen van Gogh's paintings. But I really wonder, does this book truly depicts van Gogh's life? It seems to me that Irving Stone has romanticized van Gogh's life. His life might have been as dull as mine or yours. But Irving Stone's presentation has made a whole lot of difference. This is an amazing book, inspiring and I feel one can relate to this very easily."
5,LUST FOR LIFE,The book was a gift for my spouse at Christmas. They loved paging through the book and really loved it.
2,But it's not real,"Though this fairly well-written book tells A story about the possibilities in the life of Vincent Van Gogh, it's not what actually happened. There are real events and words from the painter, but it's strung together in the writer's imagination. I was left feeling empty, missing a real connection to what might have motivated Vincent Van Gogh during his life. Readers are left without the means to consider Van Gogh's actual life because this is just one person's guess-though an educated one-as to what happened."
4,great little radio,"I've had one of these for years (dropped the other one causing the mouthpiece part to break off restricting it to cellphone mode, a convenient option, but not always desired hence, they are not heavy-duty). Good battery life, tho not rechargeable. They'd probably take rechargeable AAs, but they won't recharge in the unit.The folding antenna is a nice feature, making it compact enough to slip into a jacket pocket. The range is not huge, so if you need huge range, get a GMRS unit. Great for car-camping, trips to the supermarket and such or places where cell signals are poor or nonexistent (exhibition halls, etc.) The shorter range would probably be a problem at the mall, but would probably be good outside at the county fair. Great to keep in touch with the kids on outings."
2,Flimsy sandbox,"My boys thought that a treasure chest sandbox was a cool idea, being into the pirate theme. Thankfully I purchased this sandbox in-store, because I returned it the very same day. I didn't even fill it with sand before I realized it was a cheaply made toy. The plastic is thin and was bent or warped in a few places. The lid wouldn't fit on correctly, even if it wasn't bent at some of the edges it wouldn't have been a good, secure fit. I was surprised that Little Tikes would make something so flimsy. I exchanged it for the Step 2 Naturally Playful Sandbox, which is sturdier and the lid works much better. Spend the extra $10 for a sandbox that is higher quality."
1,Just fine -- until it rains!,"We were quite happy with this sandbox until it rained! The lid and sides allow rainwater to fill the sandbox, and until we replaced it with a MUCH better alternative (Step 2's Naturally Playful Sandbox), we had a sandy-bottomed pool and a very disappointed little boy. Little Tikes was good about it, though, and in return for us sending them photos of the water-filled sandbox, they did send us a certificate for the purchase price to use toward other Little Tikes products."
2,moldy sand,"This sandbox is terrible. We have had it for one year now and it doesn't keep the water out even with the lid on. In fact, there are such large gaps between the lid and the box that it becomes an insect haven (spiders, earwigs etc). The wind has blown the lid off several times. And so much moisture got into it over the winter because the lid didn't fit properly that when we opened it up this spring all the sand was moldy on top. Talk about disgusting. Unfortunately, my hubby is really frugal so he won't let me buy a new box for our girls but for those of you still shopping, my advice is to save yourselves the hassle and spend an extra $10 or $15 on a better box."
4,My son loves it!,"My son is turning 2 in a month so we bought him this sand box. He LOVES it! we cant tear him away. My husband and i also like it, Because it looks good on our patio and it doesnt stand out.Its a good value for someone with a small outdoor patio or deck that is covered.The shape makes it take up less room than the animal shaped ones and its bigger!Although, I do agree that the plastic it is made out of is not as good as the animal shaped ones. This one is thinner but its not that flimsy like some say. However the cover IS flimsy and i could see water maybe getting in if it rained hard. Or the cover blowing off in a big wind. We have NOT had that problem because we have a covered patio.That is why i gave the durabilty of the toy a 3 the cover could be made better. Other than that it is great."
1,Buyer Beware!!! Rain haven!,We have had this sandbox for about a year and it is constantly filling with rain water. Flimsy lid does not fit correctly and Little Tikes will do nothing without a dated receipt within 1yr - basically told us too bad. Buy the Step 2!!!
4,Good value,"I purchased this on sale at TRU for 39.99. The more expensive ones ($50-70) may be a tad sturdier, but I don't think the difference is significant. I think this is a great sandbox for the price."
5,A rare gem,"I bought this item for one reason and one reason only--this Japanese import is the only place you'll find Bolton's gorgeous cover of Stevie Wonder's classic hit ""As."" You can't even get it on iTunes! If you want to try before you buy, you'll have to rent the the Disney movie ""Snow Dogs,"" in which Michael Bolton plays a cameo role. ""As"" is the closing song . . ."
5,excellent,excellent story-telling and details. hard to put it down.only gripe is that there is not as much coverage of her mentalproblems as you would expect from the title.
2,Mediocre,"I'm working on a project about Curie, so I've read several biographies about her thus far. This book isn't absolutely terrible, but I think it handles Curie poorly. It underexplains much about her life and motivations, gives little due to the science behind her work, and goes out of its way to make her ""inner world"" excessively dramatic. Curie's story is amazing and fascinating, but this book sacrifices explanatory detail and historical context in favor of an emotionally simplified (and thus more boring) version of the person. Even the title is misleading -- Curie was dedicated to her work and slightly reclusive, but she was hardly an obsessive personality.I encourage you to please check out the longer but much more engrossing biography by Susan Quinn (titledMarie Curie: A Life (Radcliffe Biography Series)), which provides the historical and scientific context necesssary to make Curie's story really come alive."
5,Fantastic book about an amazing scientist,This book is a fantastic look at the life of Marie Curie. The book not only discusses her life but delves into the life of her family and colleagues in a way that provides a well rounded picture of Mrs. Curie's life. If you're at all interested in Marie Curie I highly recommend this book.
1,Not happy or satisfied!!,"I'm sure this item would have been nice except that my mom never got it. I bought it as part of a surprise gift for my daughter and had it shipped to my mom because they won't ship to APO. It's a shame that this company won't send stuff to the military families serving overseas, protecting their rights. Anywho, my mom never received any of the stuff and when I reported it to the company they pretty much called my mom a lier and told me that I was out of luck and wasn't going to get my money back. Thank goodness that Amazon stepped in and gave me my money back, but now I am still stuck with out any bedding for my daughters new bed. SO, I am NOT happy and satisfied with this company and I will make sure to tell all my friends not to trust this company."
4,looks nice,"the valance material is a little thin, but still looks nice to top my window. if it was a curtain to keep light out, wouldn't work that great. But, I use them with blinds..."
3,"Better than the curtains, but not by much.","I am doing my nursery in Winnie The Pooh and I thought these bumble bee curtains would be the perfect finishing touch.The valance is okay, nothing special, but I am going to keep it and put up pale yellow curtains under them.I purchased two sets of curtains, they were different lengths, different colors, and had torn seams, very poor quality, especially for approximately $50 a set!I would NOT recommend these curtains."
4,Not too bad,"I bought these curtains for my daughter's room. At first I wasn't sure if I liked them, then after they were put up, I thought they were the perfect touch to the room. Good buy*"
5,a great peek into the past,"This book comes Highly recommended. It gives an historical overview that most books miss. Words from the common person, struggling to survive and thrive are inspiring ."
2,Annoying Assemby,Very poor instructions and tedious assembly. Requires multiple tools and really 2 people to accomplish this.
5,AWESOME,"Just got this sub to replace my sony 8 inch sub. I plugged this sub in, put on a cd and this thing rocks. The lows hit so low and sound awesome with my Klipsch Quintet SL Home Theater System. If you are looking for a great sub for movies and music then GET THIS SUB! You will not be disappointed."
3,Long term owner,"I owned the Acoustech H-100 for three years. Then suddenly, there was tremendous distortion in the subwoofer. Then there was nothing but an infrequent drum like sound. Suspecting it was my receiver, I replaced my Onkyo 608 with a Yamaha 671. Same problem. I never suspected that the subwoofer were bad since I had it in the bedroom and rarely played it and when I did play it, it was set to very low sound level.So I replaced the H-100 with another subwoofer and sure enough the Acoustech was bad. I removed the H-100 amplifier and there were a couple of brown blown capacitors. I had hoped that the H-100 would last longer than three years. By the way, the telephone number affixed on the subwoofer back was no longer working. Very disappointed.The sound was great when it was working. So I gave it a 3 star rating."
4,Great subwoofer,This is a great subwoofer with all sorts of power and easy adjusments with switches and knobs on the back. I read several reviews that tested this subwoofer against much more expensive brands and this one was always as good or better and cost half as much.The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because of the frustration that a sticker on the speaker screen gave me (yes this is a petty complaint). It would not come off even when applying some heat (I actually think this made the sticker glue stick better). I would have left it on but it was crooked and looked bad. I ended up using a black marker to cover what I could not get off.The other thing is that the power cord does not plug in securely to the back of the unit. Not a real problem unless you have animals or small children (same thing) that may knock it loose.Despite these two small problems I would definately recomend this subwoofer for both home theater and music listening.
5,"Spend a little, get alot.","I was very hesitant to buy this speaker but I had just lost my old one and money was very tight, so I did'nt have much of a choice. I researched it at Bic's web page and every audio page that I could come up with. I did'nt read one negitive thing about it. The only thing I could say that may turn someone away, would be that this is a sub for a normal,(small to medium) size room.The encloser, grill and speaker all look very high quality, very nice fit and finish.The sound that comes out is quite good, of course your placment will change the sound to your own tastes.I have it set up to about one half volume and to the parameters of my receiver, it fills my room with full rich bass and responds beautifully to movies, I turn it down for music because I don't really like my music with bass as the focus.Mike from Canada"
1,Where are the sources?,"This book is fantasy. It uses very few sources to support crucial elements and hypothesis and boils down to a delusional opinion of a Right Wing conspiracy theorist. The author refuses to debate this material because it is far fetched and unrealistic and it should **NOT** be taken seriously. It uses eyewitnesses who were in Nanking as sources when they agree with the author; however then when those sources refute the author's opinion, they are cast out. Read this if you want to know how NOT to conduct serious historical research. The author should be labeled as a right wing fanatic and illusionist; this should be listed under ""fantasy/fiction""."
1,Why bother use Infrared,I don't know why you would need to spend the money. When I'm on the road I just sync up using the Infrared connection. Most laptops these days have the IR port and this seems to be a reason to finally use it.It's a bit slower but unless you are syncing MP3's on the road it seems to be fast enough. Fast enough even to sync e-mails with attachments.
3,"Hear, Hear.",It really is a bit much for a cable. It does what it says and gives you flexibility on the road...but if you can find a cheaper alternative...do that.For [the $...] you could probably build your own and still go to a movie and have the big popcorn.
3,Not Bad For FlatWound Strings........,I bought these strings as an experiment and a change from playing Round Wound string sets. These Jazz Chromes are not bad for jazz/blues playing. But like always I find flat wound strings to be very punchy..These strings are not bad strings and I did not have any problem with breaking as one of the other customers. It's all how you handle your string sets. I do believe that I will be going back to my original taste in guitar strings. And that would be the GHS Compound Nickel Wrap set 1810. They have a brighter sound but there is always a trade off for string sets regardless who makes them. The D Addarios Light chromes are okay. I thinkg for me GHS is a little bit more of a compromise. All in All these Jazz light chromes are okay and they get the job done........I think I'm sold on GHS more so than D'Addadrios. Happy playing
5,Great Archtop Strings,These strings are excellent for an archtop jazz guitar amplified or not. I have tried them all and find these the best for tone and playability.
4,"Might be okay, don't know yet.....","Ordered a Minolta underwater housing for a Dimage XT camera. Arrived in a week, no packaging, no instructions, etc. just the housing. Minolta does not have the instructions online. Need to know what to lube the o-ring with and where to get a replacement o-ring since they no longer make the housing. Main thing is the instructions, would have been nice to have them. Thought the item was new when purchased, but obviously, it isn't."
4,Great gift for a Saints fan!,This grill set is well constructed and makes a great gift for a fan whil enjoys grilling. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the price is steep compared to other quality grill sets.
1,Not Creole,"Although you could never tell it by reading the other reviews, this book has NOTHING to do with Creole. It is an English picture book - you see a picture of a ladder and it's referenced to the word ""ladder"". It's a lot of pictures and the English word for each item. Before you buy, look at the cover and excepts - I didn't.I think what you need is ""The Basic Oxford Picture Dictionary (English/Haitian Creole Edition).Just don't buy this book unless you're trying to teach or learn basic English."
1,the basic oxford picture dictionary (monolog),"This book is very deceptive. I wanted to get a book on creolecalled ""the basic oxford picture dictionary English/creole""and I ended getting this one instead. the two book have the same cover but they are very diferent. one does not have anything to do with creole but the title start the same and the cover look the same. this can be confusing for first time buyer of such a language book. I know that there are a lot of people out there probably making the same mistake. this should be fixed so one does not blow there hard earn cash on mailing back and forth."
3,Another Zodiac?,"May I first say, that I have not read the entire book as of yet but I did read the article excerpted from it, call Sun, Moon, Rising Signs. Her interpretation of Sagittarius Moon was very lacking in what is the true spirit of that sign. There was no mention of the adventurous nature, wanderlust, or need for freedom that so characterizes that sign. She seems to deal mainly with the emotional levels, or lack thereof, of each sign and fails to capture the unique nature, spirit or characteristics of the signs she describes.I have studied astrology for 28 years, and am an avid student, and a voracious reader, but I doubt that I will add her book to my collection."
5,Amazing film that will touch your heart,Had been wanting to see this film after seeing the trailer on iTunes and being captivated by Parker Croft's performance. Finally got to watch it on instant video on amazon and am completely in love with the film. Amazing and real film with great turns by the entire cast. Highly recommend.
2,Not one of the best Wee Sing videos,"Although my kids love most of the Wee Sing videos, they never could sit through this one. Wee Singdom and the Christmas video are the only ones that they don't enjoy. They are only slightly more fond of the Old King Cole video."
3,Wee Sing is the best!,"I think that Wee Sing was just about the best series of kids movies ever made. They keep everyone entertained! Although this one is a little slower, and it never did entertain me, the rest of the series is great. The whole Wee Sing collection should be a part of every family, or else you're missing out. (I should know, I actually started a ""Wee Sing fansite"" -- try to find it!) And I still think that Wee Sing is the best."
2,Wee Sing videos are great. This one is not.,"My son loves the Wee Sing Train and others in the series, so we rented this one. I'm glad that we rented this one before we bought it - this one stinks. It moves VERY slowly, and the songs are too down-tempo and boring.You'll be happier if you choose a different title."
4,Great Late 70's Hard Rock!,"I never knew much about these guys until I read Martin Popoff's first book on heavy metal. I have the first album too but I think this one is better. My favs are the title track, Waiting, Evil, I Think I Got It (""I think I got it from you"", classic lyrics), and minor hit Woman. I wish I had heard these guys when I was younger but better late than never. Decent playing and just as good as any other hard rock from the late 70's. Great album cover too!"
4,Still Great Games,We actually purchased all of the titles individually when they were first published (we still don't have the Friends game). They are all very good games. My 6 year old son has learned to play Chess so well from this that he can beat his parents more than half the time. Legoland was so addictive that he and I played nothing else for about 2 weeks straight. I still find I like creating parks from scratch.My only complaint: Can't run Lego Creator under Windows XP. Lego Alpha Team's sound is dodgy under Windows XP. I wish Lego Media would provide a minor patch for these products.
5,Well done!,"This book is very well written, I absolutely could not put it down. the title pretty much explains the book but, the information Eleanor provides us with is amazing. It almost seems fictional, but you know it's fact, which makes it even better. I recommend Sex with the Queen to nonfictional and fictional readers everywhere."
1,Terrible - make one yourself,"Save yourself the time and money and go to a thrift store, and an artshop and buy the shirt and paints.. Paint it and then throw it in the bin - this should at least save you the postage costs for this shirt"
3,very bright!,My husband likes his Christmas Hawaiian shirt... festive colors. It is actually made in Hawaii. You must wash in cold water.
1,Cheap strings,I strung my daughter's guitar with these and within a couple weeks (she doesn't often play) the windings on two of the strings broke. Utterly useless.
1,Stay away from this car seat,"We got this car seat as a gift. From the beginning we had problems with it. The seat didn't seem to fit into the base very well, and it was always a struggle to connect and disconnect the seat from the base. The second time we used the seat, we noticed the foam pads inside the head support had disintegrated into dust, and had gotten all over our baby's head and clothes. There is a reason why this car seat it so cheap, and its because its a poor quality product. Luckily, we purchased a Graco car seat and have had no problems with it."
1,Really awful,"I thought I could deal with the things other reviewers said about this seat, but really, it was a waste of money. The lining is disintegrating and the base stuck to the seat for weeks and I couldn't separate the two. Go with something else!"
1,I wouldn't recommend Combi,"I used this carseat for 6 months. From day 1, the foam in the padding started to disintegrate into dust. It's disgusting. And it got worse as time went on. You can take the padding out and shake all the dust off and the next day that you use it, its all there again.I was also missing the canopy in my box and they offered to send me one for ""free"" but the shipping was $17. I paid them for the shipping because the canopy is a necessity for me but felt really disappointed in the company for it (by the way, the postage stamped on the envelope that the canopy came in was about $3).If it weren't for the poor customer service and the disintegrating foam, the carseat would be a 3 star anyway. Its often hard to remove from the base and you have to work it free. The carrying handle is also often hard to put down because the side button releases get stuck. I really regret my choice in buying Combi, I won't make that mistake again."
3,real user,"The design is good and it's heavier, but somehow, the base is a little bitter longer than usual.(a) I don't have a LATCH in my car, so only safety belt is applied to the base. And when the basket is locked onto the base, the whole combi is easy to be turned over because of the long base and basket weight. It should be better if your car has a LATCH, which offers a second position to fix the base, and of course, avoid the turn-over.(b) Not easy to take the basket out of base. I usually have to try 2 or 3 times."
3,The item spent too much time at Amazon's warehouse,"We ordered jogger and comby tyro II Infant Car seat two weeks ago from amazon. It arrived, baby arrived, and as we were getting out of hospital and adjusting seat for our baby, we noticed that the sponges inside and around the seat were turning to dust. Went all over babies clothes.We called Combi customer support and they told us we have to deal with Amazon to ""fix"" this.Apart from that. We had problems installing and fixing the base in our Sonata - but we'll probably take it to a Babie's R us or some place like that to make sure it is fitting properly."
1,dust everywhere,Don't buy this from amazon.com. Sponge inside of the carseat cover became a dust when I first open the box and the dust was spreaded everywhere. Nobody wouldn't want to use this dirty stuff for newborns. Don't be fooled by its price.
1,would not recommend,"I did massive research for a carseat and would not recommend this one. Bulky, long car seat base which does not fit well in Honda civic. Flimsy canopy, heavy seat, padding that dissolved when washed by hand. Very disappointed."
2,"Very Light, Difficult to Buckle, Falling Apart","It is hard to buckle, you really have to push hard and make sure not to pinch baby at the same time. Canopy is very flimsy and droops, not to mention, short and doesn't cover well. Velcro from diapers, pacifier holder, etc pulls the fabric giving it a pilled look. The foam underneath is crumbling and making messes everywhere. I bought it before she was born so it is too late to return it now that I know all this! However, it is very light and easy to carry."
2,dust from the foam padding inside the car seat,"I bought this car seat based on good rating. I did not have any problems with shipping or the product when received. The car seat looks and feels very comfortable. After 1 month of use, I saw some dust on the seat of the car coming from the padded foam inside the top cover of the car seat. It looks like the foam is of very low quality and can't last long. I am going to contact Combi to see what they can do but for now, I am very disappointed with the product. I hope other people don't have the same issue."
1,How to Show Your Own Dog,"Fortunately this book is currently out of print, and should stay that way. The illustrations and pictures throughout the book date back to the late fifties and sixties. No where in the book does MS Nichols discuss in any detail the finer points of actually showing your purebred dog. To her benefit she did a very good job of depicting what it is like to attend a dog show and how champions earn their pionts. Unfortunatly, most of this information is not laid out in any organized manner. At times I felt like I was having a friendly cup of coffee as she skipped from one thought to another. Her biggest inside tip under the chapter ""Tricks of the Trade"" was ""Keep your nose clean, your eyes and ears open, and your mouth closed until you know what it is all about."" Good advice since you won't learn what showing your own dog is about from this source."
3,not that bad,"I see everyone else's issue of button sensitivity, but it isn't bothering me too much. I'm a hard hitter on the keyboard, and it is something to take into consideration before buying this keyboard. I touch type with ease, and my wpm is about usual, and hopefully I will get more used to it as this is my first day using the keyboard. My only real complaint is the length of the wire that it came with. I am uncertain if they make usb extender cables. For older computers, like mine, they have included an adapter so the keyboard can go into the old style jack. Be warned, though, that this is a bit of a compulsive buy unless you are a germophobe, a night owl, or your computer room now double functions as a baby's room."
4,Very nice,"Good keyboard, but the keys took some getting used to. They're bigger than a normal keyboard, so it was difficult at first to type. It got easier."
2,not good,"Has a lot of loose connection issues - so it doesn't work some times. If you move the keyboard a bit, when it is working, it stops working. It collects dust. I don't know how waterproof it is - dont want to try it - already ordered another normal keyboard. Yes, I have key press issue to...I have to strike it hard with concentration in order for the keys to work."
1,You get what you pay for,"Howdy,I bought these towels last week during the Friday Sale, understanding that I would be getting 6 separates for 8 bucks. I was not expecting high quality, and totally got what I paid for. Out of the packaging the towels had strings which were already running; the hems were not complete and separating from the towel itself. I then washed them, I understand that towels will pill... but please! Pill city! I have fuzzies in my hair that I am fishing out.If they last a year, it will be worth the 8 bucks, then they may make excellent rags. Just don't use them on your car! Unless you like the fuzzy look."
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased 2 sets of the blue jacquard towels, the color seemed to be true to the picture on website, but the quality is very poor. Very thin and cheap looking towels. I would not order these towels again."
2,Poor Quality (you get what you pay for),Very thin towels I would not recommend unless for camping pool etc..
1,It's not good deal.,"I purshased this towel set for Yoga exercise, because 6-pieces and very cheap price. However as the price said, the quality of towel was terrible. They have shrunk in the wash at once and cotton lint came out much. It's cheap, but I don't think it's worth to buy."
1,Pem America Towels,"These towels are horrible. They almost seem as if they are irregular towels. One towel did not match the seams of the others, one was unraveled, they leave lint everywhere and they do not absorb water very well. I will not buy more of these."
2,A $49.95 value?,I was not thrilled with the advertising on this one that claimed it was a luxury towel set with a $49.95 value. The set came in a plastic bag and the quality of the towels were very low average. I was not impressed and wish I had not bought so many.
1,Towel Set,When these towels arrived they had a strange unpleasant oily smell to them. I put them into the washing machine and they practically fell apart. I had to scrape pieces of the towels from the machine tub. It was packed with heavy sticky lint and I am just lucky that my machine survived the ride. I use them now to dry the dogs. They were cheap so I guess you get what you pay for! I do not recommend these towels as they are a total waste of money.
1,These Towels Are Terrible,They are some of the worst towels I have ever purchased. They are not very absorbant. They wash horribly. I'll never purchase another set again. Amazon should be giving them away!!!
1,Falling apart after one washing!,Not very good quality. Kind of scratchy. Staring falling apart after first wash!
4,New author has major writing future!,"Reading Barb Dimich's books, Concealed Judgement and SEALed Fate was like watching a movie. She's an artist who knows how to paint with words. Her characters come to life with excellent and colorful descriptions. So much so, that I felt like I was living the story myself. I couldn't put her books down with scenarios that kept me glued to the pages until the end. I wanted more chapters. I can't wait until her next book comes out. V. Maki from Minnesota."
3,The 2nd Best Gellhorn Biography,"This is a nice complement to authorized biography of Gellhorn by Caroline Moorehead. The author goes over the same ground, but in much less detail and without access to most of Gellhorn's letters or private diaries. However, ""Beautiful Exile"" contains some needed analysis and criticism of Gellhorn which was solely lacking in the Moorehead book.A definite minus is an error filled appendix and Rollyson's pedestrian prose style.Probably best for Gellhorn fans who've read the Morehead biography and want a different perspective."
1,Horrible--quit working...,"This product stopped working completely within 4 months of owning it. I don't even dry my hair every day. I use a hair dryer an average of 3-4 days a week and dry my hair for about 5 minutes. The heat settings didn't seem to work--the temperature setting was not consistent at all. And, most importantly, this completely stopped working after less than 4 months. I would definitely go with something else!"
1,warning- Very Short Cord,"The andis company is very good for hairdryers, yes they tend to have a heavy motor, but thats because they last a long time.This hairdryer was cheap for a reason, I found out after i bought it, the cord is VERY SHORT. I would not recommend it for anyone who needs to move around to a different room to blow dry their hairThe blow dryer was okay for people with straight hair, not curly."
4,Design Director,This product should fill the bill in an Interior/Universal Design project we are finishing. This will be modified to fit into the custom sized generous wall pockets for our wheel chair accessible shower room.
4,"not as good as ""sign or Hound of the baskerville"" however","If you're a Brett fan you have only so many choices. The master blackmailer, filmed late in his career, still holds up. It's a nice story with Holmes flirting, in disguise, with the scullary maid. And outwitting the master Blackmailer.It's better then The Eligible Bachelor and The Last Vampyre but the best two hour productions are The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Sign of Four."
1,A Travesty,"One of the finest Sherlock Holmes short stories, ""Charles Augustus Milverton"" showcases Holmes and Watson at their very best: brave, dashing, and humorous. This Granada adaptation manages to throw out every feature that makes the story great, padding it out with unconvincing background detail and, in one particularly dreadful episode, suggesting that Holmes has actually fallen in love. Designed to give Jeremy Brett an actor's holiday, this little scene is an index to everything that went wrong with this series in its later years -- sentimental, unnecessary, and ludicrously untrue to Conan Doyle."
1,horrible horrible phone,"it gets horrible reception except in the most covered area. i live less than a mile from a major shopping center with a tower and i get no reception standing in my front yard. i have to call three or four times before my call goes through because i get ""network busy"" or ""call ended"" signals incessantly. ive had it for less than 6 months and the screen is very loose at the hinge. the buttons lose their spring action quickly and several of the buttons backlighting have already begun to fade.poor signalpoor designpoor qualityminimum of featuresand it cost me $180 without signing up for another two years on my contract."
2,no signal,"Both me adn my mom bought this phone about 6 months ago. She's had her's replaced once already because the screen woulnd't come on. Neither of the phones ever get good reception, with an average of 2 bars, which quickly disapear if the phone is lifted to the ear."
3,its not that bad,"Just buy it unlocked, save some dough. Its not worth signing up for, but if you need a replacement cheap, then this is it. Also, LG managed to make the menu system kind of easy to navigate. My new R3 should be so lucky as to have a ""clear"" button."
1,Don't. Buy. This. Phone.,"Where to begin?I've had the charging problems that others have mentioned. Also, the phone sometimes just turns itself off. Very convenient when you're expecting an important call. The external LED isn't even mentioned in the user's manual. It's there purely for decoration, apparently. The software on the phone is of a generally clunky quality. I can get to the Ringtones shop in one click, but if I miss a call, it's 3 or 4 clicks to check for the caller's identity. You can see where Cingular's priorities are...The one mitigating factor I'll mention is that the reception has improved greatly since I installed the new antenna that I was sent by Cingular.Next time, I'm buying a Nokia or a Samsung."
2,most diverse review on the planet,"I have the LG C1300.. the design is good but it is too small, and that idle light i hate.. the ringtone quality is real tones & mulitimedia is ok and text is the very best.. it can handle text better than anyother phone that i have had. the battery when i talk on my phone in an average weekend it lasts me the whole weekend and i stay on the phone for a total of 42 hours in the eqlivent of text and net and that sort.. and the call quality is not really that all awesome some days i can call out and sometimes i cant cause the phone is weird and in a 5 bar place i cant call out sometimes and it has been doing that too me since i got the phone.. and my quote ""ALL-in-ALL"" opinon is be careful when you choose that phone there a more downs than there is ups with that phone. so i would like to say that i warn you not to get that phone.."
3,Sure to break at some point,"I purchased two of these phones at a discounted price when I signed up for a Cingular plan. Both phones are already broken and I have only had them for 6 months. My wife's phone had the corner of the phone crack and then break off making it hard to open the face without having the screen slip out of the hing. My phones screen just got a great big blob of color in the middle so I can't read anything on the screen. The phone was great while they worked, light weight, easy to use, good ring and opptions... I'm just not happy that it lasted only 6 months. If you do buy this phone be sure to get insurance since it will probably break at some point."
1,Beware of this phone ...bad antenna on most,"Keys not designed for adult human use... volume buttons on side where a person usually holds the phone will set off rings/noises usually at an awkward time.LG also knows there is a problem with the antenna on most of these phones. They started replacing the stock antenna with a better(""red"") antenna, but they didn't get to a lot of them, especially the ""free"" ones they give you at Cingular.You have to call ""Warranty Service"" to get the new ""red"" antenna to get service without mega cutoffs. --If you live in an apartment; DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THIS PHONE! -- And good luck on a speedy finding of where the earphone/mike handless plug is.."
1,"Realy, realy bad phone","Do not get this phone. I got it for free and it was cool at first but after a few days I got *dissapointed*. Sometimes when I dialed a number and hit the talk button, I put the phone to my ear and waited. Then I looked at the screen and the *useless* thing had gone to the main menu. Also the volume is *really* bad. You have to push the speaker into your ear really hard to hear somone on the other end.WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"
3,LG C1300i and LG C1300,C1300i is the upgraded version with better reception now. Just got it so no comment on the battery life but one of the web review praise the battery life and reception.This one I just got has a bad text LCD screen that is hard to read but the graphic screen is bright and clear. Weird.Will go back to Cingular store to get it fixed or exchanged.
1,THE WORST EVER,"This phone is consistent with the quality of phones I've received from Cingular. It's A PIECE OF CRAP! I too, get no reception in my own house, and it holds a call like greased hands hold a greased ball of grease that was soaked with grease with a grease soaker. It is the worst of the worst. The speaker is crap, of you shift it at all from your EAR HOLE... sorry for the technical lingo... but if you do that, you won't hear anything. It won't charge unless the phone is turned off, and the battery lasts for about two hours of talk time, and about a day of powered on time. The most irritating part is the battery, but the dropped calls is a close second. I swear you can have five bars, but as soon as you push the call button, it will drop to two... DO NOT CHEAP OUT AND GET THIS PHONE! UPGRADE!"
1,Not worth it....,"-I've had this phone for about one year. I've hated it since week one.-It's a bit too small (which I suppose some might like)-I get dropped calls all the time (Cingular)(I never had a problem with that on my OLD Nokia)-the volume can never be turned up enough-the ear piece is worthless-the buttons on the side are a pain because they get pushed and it changes it to silent mode etc.There was a recall on the orginal antenna. I had mine replace with the ""upgrade"" and noticed no difference with reception.Even though I got this phone for free from Cingular I feel like I was ripped off. I spoke with an employee at a Cingular store and he agreed with me that it is a horrible phone. It makes me wonder why Cingular would put thier name on a horrible phone.....oh yeah, they don't care about thier customers."
1,Very Disappointing,"My fiance and I both purchased one of these phones about a year ago. My screen went completely black about two-three months ago and now his is slowly fading. The phone still works fine, but forget about reviewing missed calls, viewing your phone book, changing your ringtone....it is pretty much a useless phone. I thought my phone was an accident, but now that his is non-functioning I know it is LG's fault. Don't waste your money, you will need to replace it."
4,I have not had a problem,"I got this phone 2 weeks ago and I love it I have not had a problem with it and I get a great signal so I don't know what all the dissing is aboutITS A GREAT phone, and I charge it 1 a week!!!"
1,There should be laws against this phone.,"It's cute and light-weight. However, I've only had about 3 phone conversations that were not very choppy or down-right incoherent and dropped. We bought 3 of these for our family and they are almost always unusable. There is an echo in one of them. We have had 4 other phones, mostly Nokias, and they all served us very well. These are going back. Hope you don't wind up with one. In shopping for a replacement, ALL the sales people say that they are getting a lot of these phones back. They have a horrible reputation. I'm glad to read that some people are not having problems with theirs, though."
3,"I have this phone, sort of.","This phone is alright, It scratches up though, and it has a weak signal in general, It's a good phone, just for calling people like at school, on trips, calling mom or dad and for calling friends. I only got it cause It was free."
3,Engelbert Humperdinck's 40th anniversary edition,"For me, the Engelbert Humperdinck's GOLD 2CD set on Hip-O Records/Universal Music label from 2005 release is a much better choice in terms of sound quality and total hits songs.This 40th anniversary edition actually is Asian edition. Mine was made in Malaysia. It is on Universal Music label as well.My main concern is that Sound quality is very poor. I think it was mastered straight from the LP master, not from original master tape.This is a 2CD set and packaged in all-rounded-four-corner jewel box which usually used to keep Super Audio CD. It is called Super Jewel Box. Mine came broken, and it is hard to find its replacement in aftermarket store. Need to special order it from a specialty jewel box store, and it is expensive too. The discs were stacked one on top of the other.For your money, better buy the EH's GOLD album instead of this 40th anniversary one."
4,Great CD,Great CD just as they all are! Includes some different ones I had not heard before. Awesome singer!
4,More Gold,"Engelbert GOLD is by far the best CD i've found on him for showcasing his range and catalog of good songs but this one is not bad either. It actually is similar to GOLD except a few good ones are left out and a few different good ones are added in.Beside some of his classics he includes his version of Love Letters, Stand by Me, How to win Your Love It's All in the Game, Your Love Stays with Me and all are sung great. A mixture of the old and the new- you can't go wrong with this CD."
5,Absolutely the best yet,"I have purchased several dvds and cds from your company, all from the artist Engelbert Humperdink.I am unable to purchase products by this artist in Australia and I find your service excellent.The latest cd I purchased is the best yet. May Engelbert and Amazon keep the good times coming"
2,Candy thermometer only good for certain types of candy,"I bought this candy thermometer because I was interested in getting into candy making. In particular, I wanted to give tempering chocolate a try and thought that with such high ratings, this would be perfect for doing it right.I was very disappointed to find that the temperature gauge on this candy thermometer doesn't go low enough for tempering chocolate. This doesn't make a lot of sense to me, since chocolate seems like a pretty common candy thing to do, but the temperature gauge only goes down to 100 degrees, while tempering chocolate requires measuring down to ~84 degrees.While I'm not going to throw it away (it's still fine for deep frying), I'm going to need to find something else for doing chocolate."
1,NO W2K SUPPORT,"Wouldn't you think that intel (one of microsoft's key partners) would support their PRO hardware on a 2000 professional. Intel says ""no"" and they ""have no plans on supporting it in the future."" If you are going to buy a cam and plan on upgrading to the most current Windows release, make sure it has states explicit windows 2000 support. THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT HAVE IT!"
4,no complaints...,"Picture quality is good if you have the right lighting(Get a flexible desktop lamp w/15W soft white bulb and place it behind the camera),the audio could be better and I guess that all pc cameras need to improve the FPS(frame/second rate).the software is great."
2,No good if you have Windows 2000,This works fine with Windows ME(with a patch)and Win98 but I mostly use Win2K. Intel offers a beta driver for Win2K but it doesn't work very well. I would recommend buying a different camera if you use Windows 2000. I will have to buy another camera now that I use mostly Windows 2000.
5,Great little webcam for netmeeting,I have this webcam for over two years now and it worths every penny. I use it for video chatting and playing games.
4,Great Camera and Software,Lighting needs to be setup right but that is the case with all cameras. Great for creating AVIs from your camcorder live or prerecorded. Lots of applications to use it for. Enjoy.
3,VIDEO & VOICE,"Software is great and easy to install. The problem is when videoconferencing and the voice is running and you added video, it will work for 1-2 minutes and the voice disappears. Can I hear some more?"
4,First time mom,"I ordered these to help label bottles as I pumped to keep track of the dates and times the milk was expressed. They work great on all types of glass, plastic, and ceramics. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I accidentally dropped them on two separate occasions and both times the grease pencil ""lead"" broke off and I had to waste a lot of it just trying to peel back the paper--which wasn't all that easy to do with the thread."
1,Very hard to use,"I got these markers to write on glass bottles that I use for custom infused alcohols. You cannot use them to write on glass unless the glass is very hot. If the glass is too hot, on the other hand, the market smears. It was extremely frustrating."
4,is what you think it is,"works fine, not much to say about them. they are what you think they are grease pencils, and should last me years"
5,Just like from when I was a kid,These work well and haven't changed since I was a kid. Yay! I love these and would buy again when/if I need more in the future.
4,good book,i just had to read this book for my pol sci 1 class. it was actually very interesting. i really had no idea how much corporations were affecting america but now i do. there are so many facts in this book that make it very interesting. this is definitly a must read!
5,Corporate fascism.,"Although published in 2003 the information in ""Pigs"" is still relative in exposing current corporate practices, i.e. the control of the US government by big business. Corporate fascism is no joke and rare is the elected official who has not succumbed to the lure of monied lobbyists. The topic is serious but the book is an easy read and meant for sharing."
2,Pigs at the Trough,"This was a very poorly written book. It was repetitive, rambling and boring. I suspect she had someone write it to make money."
2,Pigs At The Trough,"This is Ms. Stassinopoulus/Huffington's latest bid for attention, and I find it difficult to take her seriously as a writer or a politician. She changes her positions on an awful lot of issues depending on what seems to serve her own purposes - I get no sense that she is behind much of anything she says or writes."
1,Her book is as unclear as her speech,The author presents ideas that are outdated and imposible to implement into society. She is obviously an idealogue who is incapable of relating reality to government. She provides simple solutions to difficult problems. It just doesn't connect and her kame logic permeates this book. I would give a lower rating one star but there is no choice.
4,Scathing Report on Corporate Greed-Well Done!,"Huffington starts strong and does not lose momentum in this scathing report of corporate irresponsibility. She definitely did her research for this book, she got down to the nitty-gritty details of the crimes committed by Lay, Kozlowski, and their gang of corrupt CEOs. Huffington's style is very witty, very acerbic, and always makes you think. The little sidebars were very funny: Match the CEO to his yacht, quizzes on the corrupt CEOs, etc.Very funny yet very disturbing--it is unbelievable to read about the extent of these scandals and crimes. Thank you Ms. Huffington for telling everyone what happened!"
2,Missed Potential,"Huffington's ""Pigs at the Trough"" had the potential to be one of the most important books on political/corporate corruption this decade. Unfortunately, while this text is well researched, it is also loaded with obnoxious ""whit,"" completely biased personal commentary, and a train of thought that is difficult to follow. A book on this subject matter SHOULD be better than the work Huffington has produced. It seems clear that, at least, this author is incapable of such writing."
4,This is a collection of corporate crimes. Surprised?,Would you be surprised to read corporate crime is alive and well? This book discussed many corporate crimes. What amazed me is they generally get away with it. It seems the honese people once again get hurt through corporate level employee greed.
4,A quick read. Loaded with facts and wit.,"If you've been reading the news lately, you surely have noticed the string of corporate scandals. What you may not have heard is that much of what the CEO's did -although certainly not all- was actually legal! That's the shameful part of the story.Ms. Huffington uncovers the corporate/political collusion to rig the game at the direct expense of the public at large and shows the extent to which the problems reach.It's a fascinating read! My only criticism is that she doesn't put any blame on the public for lazily sitting on the sidelines therby allowing this all to occur.... to our own detriment."
5,Perfect title....,"This is a perfect title for a book about unbridled greed in America. Yes, a lot of what corporate CEOs do is legal. So, what should we do about it as a society? Change the laws! Do these people even have a conscious?!?! Arianna makes a wonderful case for people standing up to say ""This is MY country and I am not taking this anymore."""
3,A Classic,"Fill Me In is an amazing song that kept me awake through long nights of homework. I would tune my computer to a UK radio station and I would wait in anticipation of the song to come on. Definately worth waiting for, worth listening to, worth all the elements that went into the song. Mellow with a beat, relaxing yet provoking."
1,BEWARE of so-called Novels of Jane Austen (Large Print Edition) -- DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!!,"This is not a collection of Jane Austen novels. The first half contains some kind of textbook information on WiMAX technology, and the second half appears to be xeroxed pages of a Sense and Sensibility paperback. I was completely floored. WARNING: I noticed there are several other versions of this book (all entitled ""The Novels of Jane Austen (Large Print Edition)"" with no description given; publisher is BiblioLife)for sale. I'm not sure whether this is some kind of scam or a sneaky way for some dude to get his WiMAX info published?"
3,utopia of the damned,"although initally i believed the book had promise, i became increasingly frustrated at the depth of detail, the commentator for Bellamys utopia, spent on explaining it. the overall structre is generally sound but can become tedoius. as for the world as bellamy envisons, well he can have it. give me the harsh, unequal, but despite this, real ninetenth century. as a vision good; as a reality no chance. but to be fair to bellamy he probably accepts this and this is why he artculates his philosophy through literature. a book that encourages you to think but it works best as a critque of the ninetenth century."
4,Off and On Target (or Wal-mart),"Edward Bellamy's vision of the year 2000 from the author's vantage of 1887 was wrong on the big things, but right on many smaller things. The Utopian communistic society never came to pass in America, but other things did. A previous reviewer mentioned the foreshadowing of e-commerce, but I would add cable broadcasting and the superstore, i.e. Wal-mart. Bellamy had a New Englander's hatred of waste and the book was his attempt to answer that very American question, ""How can we do this better?""All in all, a hopeful and challenging book. It makes you ponder conditions in the real year 2000 and the possibilities a hundred years hence. If you liked H.G. Wells' ""A Time Machine"" or Thomas More's ""Utopia,"" then there's a good chance you'd like this book."
3,Dense,"The book is very interesting on his perspective of how 2000 would turn out, however, it is mostly a conversation making it a little hard to read purely for enjoyment. But I am enjoying it"
3,"John West, from the late 19th Century, travels to 2000 AD!","On the surface this book published in 1888 is nothing but a small science fiction book about the future, but it doesn't take much digging to find the socialist vision of the future within. While very interesting and, yes, thought provoking, many parts of the book read very much like a political science book than a utopian novel. It is entertaining, yes, but I would not look at it as a study of human society. The book shows the government as 'allowing' things to happen, such as the evolution of small businesses to huge monopolies, while in our own history we know the government of the early 20th century fought it tooth and nail, with anti-trust laws, while the people fought the idea of monopolies, refusing to become nothing more than unfeeling consumers.We are more than just capitalists and workmen. We are painters, dreamers and, yes, writers too!"
2,not worth your time,"The book is (at best) a third rate utopian hack job, that maybe has some interest for those who have a special interest in utopian lit."
3,The Dogmatic Utopian Dream,"""Looking Backward"", by Edward Bellamy, was clearly a vehical to espouse a leftist utopian view of society. Mr. Bellamy's account of society in the year 2000 could have come verbatim from Stalin's Soviet propoganda. This is an excellent book to read for the purposes of recognizing pie eyed utopian drival that has proven to destroy societies that try to implement policies to support this dogma."
1,Paint Drying is more interesting,"Having been forced to read ""Looking Backward"" by Edward Bellamy, for a American History class, I can safely say that there are some parts that are interesting, but most of the novel is about as mind numbing as watching paint dry!"
4,Still pretty interesting,"This ""novel"" is an excellent description of socialism at its best (written, incidentally, decades before Stalin or the USSR). The story is pretty irrelevant, consisting of your basic heterosexual narrative thrown in simply for the purposes of getting published, I imagine. The ideas about what socialism would look like are presented almost entirely as dialogue in the form of explanations to a knowledge-hungry gentleman who has been in a hypnosis-induced comma for a hundred years, and awakes to find himself in a futuristic utopia.It's interesting to note that Bellamy wrote a sequel to this book (long out-of-print) that addresses the problems with his socialist vision. There is dissent in this new world, and Bellamy describes an alternative anarchist society rising on the fringes to address the lack of freedom in his socialist model."
4,"Good, but a bit boring","I enjoyed reading ""Looking Backward."" It speaks much about the problems facing America near the turn of the century; the problems that affected almost everyone in America every day. The problems of greedy monopolists is the most evident, but also others. The book is not as much as a story as it is the author laying out his groundwork for a perfect society with a story sort of, but not really, built around it. There is sort of a romace, but almost the entire book is characters telling the protagonist what the future is like. I do find it funny though. Back in the 19th century, authors GREATLY underestimated the technological progress of mankind. Just decades later, it was the opposite- and authors were greatly overestimating it."
3,You'll be bound and determined to finish....,"Bellamy's 'Looking Backward' is an interesting little book - it may just as well have been an essay of the author's opinions of what the future may bring. Lacking in plot, this novel is by no means an easy read, but worth reading even if only to say you finished!"
4,Not Stalinistic in the least,"As pointed out in a recent review of this book in Harpers' Magazine, ""utopian"" writers are often unfairly branded with the brush of the holocaust (or as my fellow Chicagoan says below, Stalinism). This is simply untrue: Stalin was a power hungry thug, and to paint utopians with the racist brush of Hitler is to paint democrats with the racist brush of apartheid (the South African government was democratic as far as whites went). Moreover, Bellamay wasn't alive during these times. ANd nowhere in this book were those who disagreed eliminated - it claims that popular thought evolved to this vision.What I remember most from this view wasn't that I agreed with its ideal society but a feeling of sweetness from its faith in the ultimate goodness of humanity and a willingness not to turn its head from the worst problems of our times or admit defeat to them."
3,This must have been a satire.,"The utopia envisioned by Bellamy is so outrageous that I cannot help but to think that this was a satire. Even without the knowledge that socialist utopias would fail miserably wherever tried, surely no one could possibly believe what Bellamy, who does seem intelligent, pretends to believe. Did he really think that mere love of country, and of fellow man, would inspire everyone to be economically productive? Surely, anyone who believes this has no understanding of human nature. Did he really believe that we would want to live in a society in which a man couldn't sell a five-dollar item to his neighbor without going to the federal government for approval? Did he really believe in a world without war? If this book was meant to be a satire, give Bellamy credit. If not, then he must have been such an idealist as to be completely blind to reality--the reality of human nature."
5,Twisted Wabbits,What delightful book. Gagne in color is even twice the power of his other popular offerings. I think he has really matured into a fine author and every new book is a joy. All I can say to Twisted Rabbits is bravo. What great designer.
4,Text book,Interesting textbook. This is a good book for people wanting to find out about bringing older buildings up to today's standards eco wise. Also like Amazon's return for credit at the end of the semester. It helps me afford to get the textbooks I need each semester!
3,worked for me,I haven't read all the books in this field so I don't know which one is better - but this book seemed to do the job for me. It iscomprehensive and fairly self-explanatory and I learned things I didn't know. But keep in mind that when I started the book I knew 0
4,great resource,Krigger explains energy use and conservation in a very simple way. Very informative resource that I foresee using for many years to come.
5,Great book...,"There is so much information in this book! I really wish I had purchased earier...before renovating my house. The DYI books I used were helpful, but after reading through Residential Energy, I discovered so many things that I have done wrong. It will take a huge effort to go back and correct the mistakes that I made. This book has me looking at my house in a completely different light. The content of this book is so important, I just wish I had read it a long time ago!"
4,"Consider ""Insulate and Weatherize"" Instead","Consider starting with ""Insulate and Weatherize: Expert Advice from Start to Finish"" by Bruce Harley instead which is a more practical ""Go Do It"" book with lots of photographs. ""Residential Energy"" does have more formulas and the like."
3,Needs strong editor,"This book needs a strong editor. It covers many things but is difficult to read because of poor graphics, organization, and sentence construction."
3,"Useful, but perhaps better resources available","This book might be useful for someone just digging into the issues of residential heating and cooling. It's presentation format doesn't presume the reader has much prior knowledge of the material, which dovetails nicely with the medium-level details of the material. I consider it a pretty decent overview, but by the time I had read it, other materials I had covered made this book redundant."
5,Who wouldn't love this album? Gorgeous.,"If you're new to Caetano, buy this and Cores Nomes first. Every track is beautiful. The arrangements are simple withhout ever losing its lush sensuality. If I had to pick some favorite tracks, I'd say Oracao ao Tempo, Vampiro, Cajuina, and Trilhos Urbanos, which is now a Brazilian standard."
1,Far from complete,"I was very disappointed that some big Hollywood stars were not in the book (including some that were easy to come by), and yet so many stars that I've never even heard of were filling so many pages. I've been a serious Hollywood autograph collector and enthusiast for over 20 years and was upset to see some of the bigger stars not included. Some big and popular stars missing were Dustin Hoffman, Orson Welles, Cyd Charisse, Christopher Reeve, and Gloria Swanson. And who in the world is Kelly Reno? Sherilyn Wolter? Jackee Harry??A waste of my money."
2,third rate at best,"i bought this cd because i heard they had some ties to thursday, who are the best band ever. some of the music is good, but the vocals sound forced. it's pretty boring. i'd rather listen to thursday."
1,100 XP Games--Misleading,"Most of the games are overly simple, and many are ""teasers"". That is, they are very limited versions of the game and require that you purchase the full version to play the game. Of course, it's [inexpesive] but still not worth it. Also, I note that there are few games available that support XP directly."
4,Dated But Effective Thriller!,"I've now read the entire ""Art Jefferson"" series, and enjoyed ""October's Ghost"" the most. Even though real events have superseded the situation portrayed in the novel, it was compelling enough to not be spoiled by that.Here's what I liked about ""October's Ghost"": Much of the plot COULD have occurred in real life. The investigative techniques Art, Frankie, and the other law enforcement characters employed were reasonably accurate. Action scenes, especially the several gunfights and police pursuits, seemed to have been based on actual occurrences.The plot kept me engrossed right up to the end, which was especially appreciated as I read this book on a very long flight to Europe.Mr. Pearson has a long way to go to get to Tom Clancy level in his detail and accuracy, but in many ways his character development is superior to Clancy's!Bottom line: It's a good read, and a strong component of the overall series."
5,You will do it! Or Dr.Shooveocker I will put a evil course upon you....,"The Devil Bat is a great Bela outing. Of course its no DRACULA or MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE but its hard not to get a kick out of this grade Z P.R.C opus about a MAD DOCTOR who develops a breed of giant bat he attracts to his enemies with a special after-shave he advises users to rub""on the tender part of your neck."" Loads of cheap fun,with cardboard sets and pathetic special effects;Bela seems to be having a ball and so should you! For those of you who love remakes and sequels(???)see The Flying Serpent and Devil Bat's Daughter"
3,Devil Bat - In Color,"The Devil Bat - In Color is a very nice improvement on this oldie but goodie. The quality of the print is good and the colorization is good to above average. As for the movie itself, it is one of the better efforts by poverty row studio PRC. The story is presented is pretty basic but interesting and evidently it was good enough that they reused it a few years later in the ""Flying Serpent"" (1946) by scratching out giant bat and penciling in flying serpent into the script. All in all a good movie at a good price with fast delivery to boot. Not a bad deal and I highly recomend it for all old film lovers."
2,"If you're a Bela fan, you will have to see it!","The Devil Bat is a real poverty row effort from the 1940s, when Bela Lugosi was being offered roles of diminishing quality. That being said, it does have a certain campy charm,as Lugosi trains his electrically enlarged bats to kill at the scent of his special shaving lotion formula! The big bat has to be seen to be believed, and its attack cry is really something. All in all, a fun hour of viewing."
3,Delightfully cute,"""The Devil Bat"" is what might be considered a minor, fun horror film. Bela Lugosi is delightful (as usual) as the scheming Dr. Carruthers, who is loved by everyone in his town but is secretly enlarging and training bats to be the killer of anyone who wears his new shaving lotion. The plot is not the material with which great films are made, but this is thoroughly entertaining, not scary in the least. Bela Lugosi is the brightest spot in this movie, but the acting all around does not suffer. It is cute!"
4,A,"Bitter scent-inventor Dr. Carruthers (Bela Lugosi) is betrayed by his employers when they became rich fat-cats thanks to perfumes and aftershaves he created. He extracts reeking revenge by growing giant bats in his lab and sending them out to kill his former employers. Ah, the sweet smell of success! (Some real-live fruit bats are shown in fuzzy close-ups, but mostly they are flying puppets that look sort of like kites.) This Golden Turkey classic was enough of a hit to spawn a sequel, The Devil Bat's Daughter (1946). The Devil Bat's Daughter is almost entirely unrelated to this film - in the flimsy follow-up, Rosemary La Planche plays Carruthers daughter, who is hypnotized into believing that she is possessed and being compelled to kill (no Lugosi or bats here).Staci Layne Wilson"
2,Nothing Special Here,"Killer Bats is a movie that will generate a few chuckles, not just with the acting, but also for the inferior special effects and set. It's easy to follow this film and its plot of a mad scientist turning loose killer bats on people, and the humorous idea of using a special aftershave scent to attract the bats. The picture quality in some ways is what you would expect from a film that's over 70 years old, but in other ways it should've been preserved better. The best part about this movie is its length: just 69 minutes of madness!!! If you like the chiller thriller genre, and are a fan of Bela Lugosi, then give this one a try. You may like it more than I did. This film seems to be hit or miss. It was a miss for me."
3,Great to see both but nothing beats original black and white!,"Just as a matter of principle I am against colorization and am shocked to see it still being used, especially for such an obscure film. Better to stick to glorious black-and-white, although the image quality on such an old movie cries out for a new copy. Nice cover image on the jacket however and if nothing else this makes for a unique addition to any collector of Bela's movies.Devil Bat Diary: The Journal of Johnny Layton"
3,bela's bat...,"... or 3.5 stars, Good enough entertainment with the bat flying around enough thru the film doing its deed by bela; good enough videography for today, though a 'lil dark, even though most shots in this film are @ night. ('lil means little, @ means at.)"
4,bloody bela rules in any medium,bela is always good and this color version of devil bat was pretty good. when they colorize a movie they usually clean it up toowhich is a plus.
4,Bela rules,"This enhanced version really makes the movie enjoyable. The old versions were so bleached out that it was hard to watch. Bela is really a bad boy in this and you can tell he is having fun doing it. The colored version is alright, but it has faded colors like Turner color. The new black and white is really done well. ""The corpse vanishes"" is also redone by this company and it is in as great shape as well. For the price, you cannot beat this movie if you love Lugosi as I do. Legend Films did a fine job of remastering.Herb Salisbury"
2,So-so,"Yet another of Lugosi's bargain-basement epics, this one suffers from poor scripting and a general lack of ideas. The formula repeats itself as the annoying reporter confronts the mad scientist. There are a few fun moments, but the horribly stale formula plot really doesn't hold up very well. It's OK for the viewer with a little time to kill, but it's no classic."
4,Bela Goes Batty!,"Dr. Paul Carruthers (Bela Lugosi) is a scientist who invents new fragrances for a successful aftershave maker. His failure to invest in the company has left him without the millions he feels he deserves. Carruthers is a bitter man who has sworn revenge. How? Does he plan to sue for his fair share of the profits? Nah, the sinister doc creates a small army of giant, mutant, killer bats to exact his vengeance! These fuzzy monsters are attracted by a new aftershave lotion he's formulated in his secret laboratory. He gets his intended targets to splash some on their faces. One by one, the victims are attacked, their throats ripped out by soaring, shrieking, stuffed devil bats! Bela is priceless as always. This movie belongs in every horror collection..."
5,kids love it.,"My kids love this movie. While computer animation is good, our family seems to lean towards these type more often."
1,Don't waste your money,"Ordered this video through Amazon (Robin Hood Most Wanted)And it would not play in any of our dvd players. DEFECTIVE We wrote e-mails to everyone and did not get a reply or a refund.Don't waste your time,order it from someone else.No one seems to care after they get your money.T.A.H."
4,the best robin hood movie ever.,"this is an old animated robin hood movie where the characters are animals.robin and marion are foxes.the taxman is a bear.so is john.the poor are mice.the kings a lion.you get the idea.robin robs from the rich and gives to the poor.the sheriff gets jacked and eventualy the folk hero has a duel with the king himself!the kids like it.i loved it when i was little.its a wholesome family film.its a true story so thats a plus.the kids will be educated and entertained.some of the scenes of the patheticly poor people a bit much for some kids.i guess the message is rob from the rich and give to the poor.but,wouldnt that just make the poor rich.soon hed be stealing from them and returning it to the king anyway."
3,Cute,Robin Hood is not my # 1 favorite Disney flick but it is much better than that live action Robin Hood flick starring Kevin Costner! Disney's Robin Hood cartoon flick is cute and a good one for kids especially boys.
5,My all time favorite cartoon!!,"I have loved this cartoon since I was little, so I had to get it on dvd. It has great music and great characters. Little John and Robin Hood are a great pair. The whole story line is a great, Robin Hood has such a great heart. He risked his life for the people in the town of Knotting Ham. This movie is a great classic for all to enjoy."
4,movie was good,"This item was delivered promptly. The case was a little beat up, but the movie was in good shape and we were able to watch it."
4,One of My Favorite Disney Characters,"This movie was my all-time favorite when I was little. And Robin Hood was definitely my all-time favorite Disney character. I remember how I'd sit at the kitchen table and draw countless pictures of Robin Hood, and how I'd sit in front of our family computer and write stories involving Robin Hood.Today, I have other Disney favorites, but I still love Robin Hood. And I still watch the movie from time to time. I'm hoping they'll release a 2-disc special edition fairly soon.Robin Hood makes a dashing outlaw, and I love his oversized sidekick Little John. The villain, Prince John, seems more comical than intimidating. I love the scene where he cries for his ""mommy"" and sucks on his thumb while holding his ear at the same time. Seems like a childish thing for a royal prince to do, don't you agree?If you don't have this movie, then go purchase a copy of it, or at least rent it from a movie store. You won't be disappointed."
5,As charming as I remembered.,"So rare to find a charming and entertaining film for my grandchildren and me to enjoy together, and just as I remembered. From a simpler time; Disney and perfection...it can't be beat. The voices of the characters are so diligently suited, especially with Phil Harris and his gravelly voice, and Peter Ustinov doing his over the top best; Roger Miller and his music are always the icing on the cake."
5,A great edition,"I can't add anything about the movie itself. The only reason to buy these special editions is for the extra features. Behind the scenes stuff, how the movie came about, interviews with actors who did the voices, ect. If you care about those things, this is a great set. If you don't, there is no reason to upgrade."
4,A Charming Classic Everyone Should Own,"Though probably not the strictest in interpreting the legend (not that it has ever bothered Disney) this beautiful classic was a staple for my childhood and a delight to find again as an adult. With lighthearted songs, silly jokes (some of which I ONLY understand as an adult) and beautiful characters, it's nice to see relive the ""Classic"" feel of this movie. The complete absence of humans seems a rarity-- most of the others that come immediately to mind (Bambi excepted) have at least one or two human characters-- and it is enjoyable. The supporting characters offer the best humor-- Lady Cluck will always have me in stitches, Sir Hiss's facial expressions, body language, and prissy attitude (tough to achieve in a snake!), and Little John's contrast between rough and tumble and cooking is great. A frivolous and fun movie that should be added to everyone's collection."
5,The Best,"This DVD is awsome! It is truly a Disney Classic. From Robin Hood being chased all over at the fair(which is my favorite part),to Allan-a-Dale singing away in the prison, it is a really great movie for all ages. Buy it today and dicover the world famous Disney magic known to all."
4,Movie comes alive on DVD!,"If you are a fan of this movie, you owe it to yourself to see it (or own) it on DVD. The color transfer is fantastic, the backgrounds are lush and detailed, as opposed to the washed out old VHS tape. The colors and line quality of the main characters are sharp and vibrant as well, I was hugely impressed. The movie looks on par with the newest animation releases, I can't say enough about the great colors. The background paintings look especially nice, with an almost computer-esque gradient fades on the sky. The sound is somewhat of a disapointment though, only Dolby Digital 1.0. I found it sounded best on 2-Channel stereo, even with a high end center channel. But all in all, if you haven't seen it on DVD, you really haven't seen it!"
2,"Cropped picture, few extras. Buy the original GOLD EDITION","To put it plainly, this movie was filmed in FULL FRAME 1:33-1, not widescreen as presented here. For some reason the folks at Disney decided to create a fake widescreen version by cropping off 25% of the picture from the top & bottom! What is ""Most Wanted"" about this edition is the people in charge that decided crop the picture and give you less!This is equal to watching Star Wars in a square picture, YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE FULL PICTURE.And the extras.... can you call them true special edition extras? The only reason to get this is for the deleted scene, which you will be glad was deleted after you see the sketches!BUY THE ORIGINAL GOLD CLASSIC EDITION, it is worth its gold for the full picture!"
5,Good movie!,I bought this a a gift for my grandson. This had been one of his Dad's favorite movies when he was young.
5,Great Movie,Loved this movie when I was a kid. Bought it for my son to watch and he enjoys it too. Disney hit a home run with this movie.
5,Great movie!,This is a great movie for kids and a Disney Classic. Always nice to own the actual DVDs of these movies.
4,Old Fashioned Disney Sweetness - no Disney 90's Glitzy Pop,I saw this when it first came out (I was six years old at the time). I can't tell you how many times I saw this movie - a million times? Heh heh - well perhaps not that many...I love great animation and I am a huge fan of anime - but the animation in Robin Hood compared to today's standards - is well cartoonish - but it's adequate. The one thing thing that Disney has forgotten in their new movies is the just plain down to earth sweetness that their movies had in the 70's - and especially Robin Hood. Is it just me or are the songs just a lot more fun in these Disney films too...no Broadway production numbers here thank you very much! Perhaps it's just nostalgia getting to me - but I love this movie and can't wait to get the DVD - and it's just for me - no kids!
3,Why can't this get a Platinum Edition?,"Sure, maybe it's not among the most popular of Disney movies (although it's one of my favorites). But seriously, it's so much fun! It would be even more fun if it had better bonus features (and more of them). I was tempted to buy it even though I have it on video and the DVD version of it that's been released already...that is, until I saw the lackluster bonus features included. An alternate ending? I doubt it would be worth buying this DVD just for that. That's pretty much all that's new here. The animated short might be good (I can't say for sure whether or not it's been released already). I might rent the DVD to see the new stuff, and to see if the picture's any better.I'll wait and see if Disney decides to milk this movie for all it's worth and make a Special Edition for it in the years to come. But I'm not holding my breath."
4,"A wonderful classic from my past, delightful!","Not many people give this movie enough credit simply due to budgetary constraints when it was being developed, but I grew up with this movie during my childhood and I was overjoyed to finally see my childhood disney movie brought back to life, restored and cleaned up on Disney DVD. I think this is a wonderful, charming, and enjoyable Disney film. True, it lacks the longstanding perfection like some of their biggest hits (Aladdin, Lion King, Beauty and the beast) but I love the animal design of the Robin Hood characters and I really think the vocal cast, especially Prince John's voice actor, all work nicely together to make a great film. Its old fashioned animated charm with a neat spin on an infamous old tale. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something clean, fun, and unique enough for their children to watch."
2,Cute--Not one of my favorite Disney movies but . . .,It's cute. Even a little sacharine. But it's Disney and classic. A fun family movie. (I still prefer Errol Flynn's version though.)
2,TWO ROBIN HOOD DVD'S,DVD'S would not work...who would think of checking the region? I wouldn't. I ordered these for a gift and they were sentto two different people in two different states. I am not going to ask these people to sent the DVD'S back to me and then ship them back for a refund. It is embarrassing and disappointing. Does Disney do this kind of thing? I guess I will find out.
2,Robin Hood,I am not sure that the one I received was the one that I say pictures of. The one that I thought I ordered came with the raised slip cover. I also did not know what the region 2 meant and it does not play in any DVD player in our house.
5,Wonderful Classic Movie,"This movie was an absolute favorite with my own children growing up in the 80's and 90's. Now I have purchased it for my grandsons who are 7 and 4. It has become one of their favorite movies as well. The story line is classic with the wonderful animation of Disney and the music is great. Not everyone remembers this one, but it is well worth owning to watch over and over."
3,"Rating is for this DVD edition, not the movie story","I am disappointed that Disney has decided to chop off the top and bottom of the movie frame in order to make this look like a ""wide screen"" movie. While watching this it is annoying that parts of the characters are cut off. While it doesn't take away from seeing critical parts of the story, the movie just doesn't look quite right in the 1.75:1 aspect ratio. Robin Hood gold classic edition is in the original aspect ratio."
5,NICE CLASSIC!!!!,"The story of ROBIN HOOD most be one of the famous ever!!!Many movies by this hero were made, but the DISNEY animation is the best for him!!! Really like this nice classic, with the remarkable DISNEY label of quality!! Beautiful graphics and songs, from an ERA without computers!!!Amazing!!!"
5,Love this movie and my daughter too,This movie brings great memories from my childhood and more important: my two year old loves it. It arrived in great condition and on time
4,One of Disney's Funniest,This in my opinion was one of Disney's funniest features. There are so many funny characters in this movie and even as an adult now couldn't help but laugh out loud at the antics. Great movies for kids and families!
5,Great Show! best Disney ever.,"One of the best Disney animated movies I've seen. Never a dull moment, always keeps you on your toes with cartoon silliness. a must-see"
3,ROCKIN ROBIN,"ROBIN HOOD is given a remastered edition, and while not one of Disney's most endearing movies, it has some charming moments and good voice characterizations. Peter Ustinov stands out as Prince John, the rascally usurper of his brother's throne; Terry-Thomas is fun as Hiss, the snake who is John's henchreptile; Roger Miller is an adequate troubador; Pat Buttram makes for a fine Sheriff; Andy Devine is funny as Friar Tuck and Phil Harris blusters through his Little John role. Unfortunately, Brian Bedford is a weak Robin, although Carole Shelley is delightful as Madam Cluck. The songs aren't the greatest, but they're done with energy and flair. Kids will probably enjoy it but 101 DALMATIANS remains my favorite Disney toon."
3,Not as good as I remember,"Embarrassingly enough, I had this taped off the TV, many years ago, and I watched it religiously. I also had on that tape this random cartoon about what Father Christmas did the other 364 days of the year. Happy memories!But getting this on DVD, and staying up late to watch it (something I would never have been allowed to do all those years ago), I just didn't enjoy it as much. I don't remember much of the ending, cos I ended up texting a friend on my phone. And this is one of the few Disney movies which has terrible animation. Even the characters - and the character voices incidentally - are directly lifted from other Disney classics. Look out for Little John, who's basically Baloo with clothes on and he's voiced by the exact same actor!The storyline's pretty basic, and I'm pretty disappointed. I'm still giving it three stars, because of the happy memories I had of it, but it's just not as good now as it was then. What a shame."
3,Certainly Not Walt's Shining Moment . . .,"Forget what critics have been pounding about ""The Sword in the Stone"" and ""The Black Cauldron"" being Disney's least distinguished animated features. ""Robin Hood"" takes the cake (or gold?) as far as mediocrity is concerned. It starts off well enough but never sustains any significant emotion- our sympathies don't lie with the hero (depicted himself as rather shallow and bland) but with the villain, the only joy in the entire film. One part of the film is lifted directly from Snow White (and the attempts to hide this show!); the music is forgettable and Little John is a direct reprisal of Baloo from ""The Jungle Book"". Few of the voice performances are worth mentioning and the animation itself is not even good for the 70s (and this is a Disney film!) If you collect Disney films, buy it and you'll watch it once. If you don't, skip this one by and seek out the live-action Disney feature."
5,A Great Disney Film,"A sweet movie fit for people young and old! There are three reasons I love this movie.First: The animation is AWESOME! The characters all have funny expressions when they're supposed to.Second: The story is great and easy for all youngsters to understand.Third: This movie is HILARIOUS! I LOVE it when Prince John hits Sir Hiss with a small wooden plank! Also Recommended: Fox and the Hound 2, Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars Episode 3, and Barnyard the Movie."
2,25% Less Movie than the Original!,"The original theatrical version of this film was NOT widescreen. For this DVD, Disney took a non-widescreen movie and MADE it widescreen. What does this mean for you? Less movie! Since they cannot ""add"" footage to fill in the sides of a widescreen TV, the only way they can do it is to zoom into the picture and crop out the top and bottom! This destroys any sense of composition those poor layout artists worked so hard to achieve, and is essentially like watching the film with your eyes half closed. In order to fill your widescreen television, and tout this release as ""Enhanced for 16x9 Televisions,"" Disney thought it was a good idea to bring you 25% LESS movie. If viewed on a standard TV, you now see black bars at the top and bottom of our screen, where there were none before!Get the ""Disney Gold Classic Collection"" version if you want to see the film in its entirety."
4,Great Movie!,"I bought this movie for my 4 year old son and he absolutely loves it! He loves the action, the bows & arrows, and the ""good guys"". He asks to watch it over and over, and now dresses just like Robin Hood. I would highly recommend this for preschoolers or older, my 2 year old is not interested yet. Boys especially will like it!"
2,The Story of Robin Hood is much better!,"I liked this as a child, but it's really one of Disney's weaker animated films and lacks a lot of the attention to detail that sets apart the studio's real Classics. Some of the scenes look like actual tracings from other movies (the scene where Maid Marian is dancing with the animals - it's Snow White and the Dwarfs down to every move!). I recently rented Disney's live action ""The Story of Robin Hood"" and was so impressed I went out and bought the video - great film full of excitement and suspence. It also explained the whole legend of Robin Hood better and gave the characters a bit more depth. This animated version is only so-so."
1,Wrong product,"I made a mistake in not verifying the media before I bought this product. I received a VHS tape, when I thought I had ordered a DVD."
2,This gets a special edition?!,"I know I will not be the only who sees Robin Hood as one of the most artistically poor of all of Disney's animated features, unfortunately, people think of this kind of animation when they think of '70s Disney and forget that the Disney seventies were so much superior to this.Robin Hood is weak in story-line, characters and specially artistry and yet, it seems to have a rating of 7.3 at IMDb and a high rating here, too, I guess that's the reason for the special edition because there are many other more deserving Disney films out there (The Sword in the Stone, or The Rescuers to name a few, you know the *real* Disney masterpiece films?) and Robin Hood isn't even close. Sure, it's entertaining, but the DVD release it got once was enough to satisfy it, I personally can't see the film improving with a digital restoration.Still, before saying anything else, I'll wait until the Special Edition is out and then we'll see, but so far, this film gets a 2/5."
5,17 years old,"I am 17 years old and this is still one of my favorite movies to watch!!! This movie is about a fox named Robin Hood who steals from the rich and gives to the poor. This movie is full of laughter and fun, even though im 17, i still love and will always love this disney classic!!"
1,DON'T purchase from godsnet!,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my grandson. I FULLY admit my mistake; I thought it was a DVD version not a VHS. Immediately after I hit the purchase button, I caught my error. At that moment, (not more than 1 minute after purchase) I sent an email explaining that I was sorry but I didn't want the item. I sent a total of THREE requests to please cancel the order. I didn't receive a single response from them. My VHS version of Robin Hood came in the mail and the money was deducted from my account. The VHS tape is still sitting on my dresser in the original mailing box, in the wrapper and of no use to me. I will NEVER purchase again from godsnet and would STRONGLY recommend others not to. I made a mistake yes, and would not be leaving a negative response if they would have just contacted me. No response at all makes me question the ethics of this company. RED FLAGS are up for a reason."
5,A never-dying love story,Well ... who does NOT know the story of Robin Hood? This is most definitely one of the best versions of the story. Sweet and innocent. A must have.
4,good old classic disney,"this is one of those movies that you can see a hundred times, and each time you see it, you remenber the first time you saw it with your father, a sunday morning.pretty good stuff"
5,childhood movie,I grew up watching it on a vhs tape my parents recorded from tv. It was a great addition to my dvd collection
5,So happy to have found this,My daughter loves this movie and I was so happy to have found a quality copy . She has since watched this movie 20 plus times. Thank you for a great product and lots of smiles :)
5,Great Movie! Recommended For Children & Family Alike,"I saw Robin Hood a few years ago, and I absolutely loved it! The animation was good and there were some moments when I couldn't help but laugh. It's a great movie to watch any time of the year, whether you're snowed in, rained in, or you just want to kick back, relax, and watch a light-hearted, funny classic. Again, Robin Hood is a must-see!!!"
3,Poor quality disc and return process was lacking,"The DVD itself was faulty but the movie was fine. I could not access the special features on the DVD. I would have returned it for replacement but was never given the opportunity by the seller. However, Amazon refunded the purchase price."
1,Would Not Play,"Tried playing the DVD on two different DVD players without success. I had a VHS copy of this movie years ago and loved the movie. This was a gift for my little nephew. Needless to say, we were very disappointed that this DVD would not play. I contacted the seller, who suggested it may have been a European version, and then left it up to me to figure that out based on looking for either the number ""1"" or ""2"" somewhere on the item description page. I would suggest that sellers make this information more apparent on the item description page when selling to both customers in the U.S. and Europe. It is important to note, as with many Disney movies, this DVD is not in current production and availability is limited. As a result, this item was purchased from an independent seller through Amazon.com. I love Amazon.com and do not feel that Amazon was in any way at fault for the lack of disclosure in the product description for this item."
1,Doesn't work in most DVD players,"In fact i couldn't find one that it worked in, The movie only worked on the computer. Not worth it!!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered this dvd on December 1st. I had no idea it was coming from ITALY. It was to be a Christmas present, but I received it January 15th. The cover and all writing is in Italian! The worst thing is that it will not play on the dvd player, or the x-box. It will play in the laptop. It says this dvd is only available for viewing in Italy and a bunch of other foreign countries nowhere near here. I ordered it from Utah, you would think they could send it here and it would play. I have never heard of such a thing. I can't send it back because it had to go back to Italy and I will not deal with that overseas mailing hassle. This has been a nightmare and I feel Amazon shouldn't work with 3rd parties like these people. I like to order from Amazon. You can see that I have a long history and have ordered many things from Amazon. First disappointment. Please check into these vendors and do not associate with them."
2,INCORRECTLY LABELLED PLEASE FIX,"This is not feedback for the seller, per se, because I already left positive feedback to them because the shipping was incredible and the price is more than fair. However, if you're looking to buy these PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TITLE AND THE PHOTO ARE NOT THE SAME THING, AND YOU WILL GET WHAT IS IN THE PHOTO, NOT THE TITLE. The title says the gauge is ""Regular Light"" but they are in fact just ""Light"". I don't know if the lister meant to say 'regular' as in 'just plain ol' or something.. but that is kind of a stupid error to make, honestly. there is a big difference, and if you're not an amateur guitarist, it is a HUGE difference. I wanted ""Regular Light Gauge"" strings, which D'Addario makes, but instead i got exactly what is in the picture... ""Light"" gauge, which are a little clunkier. If you aren't a serious guitarist you might be smirking at this review, but if you are, you'll know what i'm talking about.PLEASE FIX THE LISTING"
2,inexpensive but not very good,"Tone-wise, Chromes can't hold a candle to Thomastik-Infeld Jazz Swing strings. I suppose that is somewhat forgivable since Chromes cost less than half what Thomstik-Infeld Jazz Swing string cost. However, what puts me completely off them, to the point that I'd rather use GHS Precision flatwounds if I couldn't find Thomastik-Infelds, is that they are very slippery under my fingers. I don't get the same kind of tactile connection with the strings that I get with every other brand of flatwounds I've every used."
4,Spectacular showcase,"4 1/2It was apparent right from the start of this glorious '75 debut that a new paradigm of technically emotional, jazz-guitar trio work had been breached. It may taper out in spots, but ultimately this a fascinating release anyway you slice it."
4,Unsettling and beautiful,"Dark and spare, yet incredibly eloquent, Bright Size Life may very well be the best rainy day Jazz album ever produced, and a great view of Metheny in a stripped down trio format.This album is a logical starting point for neophyte Metheny fans, and is arguably the finest example of his early work (say through 1983). Metheny's style on this outing comes off innocent and naive, yet strong and fresh. Some tunes take on a nightmarish feel while others are playful and imaginative, displaying a great range of textures and emotion.The best part of this album is his pairing with the late bassist Jaco Pastorius. Jaco's moody bass lines build tension in cuts like ""Midwestern Nights Dream"", and his legendary passion for the bass provides a monolithic contribution on this album. If you enjoy the occasional melancholy mood, put this album on, turn off the phone, open a bottle of wine, watch the rain, and enjoy."
4,A Must for the Metheny Listener,"This is really great stuff. I recall Pat being interviewed in the past few years and saying that he thought that this CD wasn't that much different from his music now, only the underlying rhythms. I feel that this disc is a must for a couple of reasons. The first and most obvious reason is that it is a fantastic recording of Jaco Pastorious. I think this is one of his finest works. The second reason, and I think that many might miss this if they don't have the historical context, is that being Pat's first solo project it was a turn in the musical road that seemed filled with fusionaires. Pat sort of began to hint at his compositional genius. His playing is great and the recording really breathes."
5,So Glad I Found This,"I absolutly love this product and heard they discontiuned it I was heart broken! This product is by far my must have makeup, I've never been one to wear foundation but this product is soo light and natural looking plus the SPF it's GREAT!!! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!"
4,revlon skinlights instant skinbrightner,"Good for using as a base for your makeup. Prefer the one next to darkess on color, the golden light."
5,Will help Novell users to understand how to integrate the benefits of OES in an existing environment,"The Novell Open Enterprise Server Administrator's Handbook: Netware Edition by Novell and Netware expert Jeffrey Harris comprehensively and accessibly covers all of the major components and features of Open Enterprise Server (OES) on the NetWare platform. This impressive and confidently recommended 600-page instructional reference book will help Novell users to understand how to integrate the benefits of OES in an existing environment. With a brief but informative introduction to the concepts necessary to introduce the diverse features, Novell users will focus on the implementation of OES on the NetWare platform."
1,Didnt work for me,"So i was really excited when i got this because all the reviews were positive But when i tried it on it didnt really cover my my undereye circles,it made them more noticable because the stick is oily (in my opinion) I have already oily skin so it made it worse. I used it twice beacause i thought maybe i just didnt apply it right but it didnt matter it just didnt look natural. I probably wont use it again but its just my skin that didnt work with it maybe it does for other people but not me. ill probabaly go back to the Mary Kay concealer which works muchbetter on me and actually blends in with myskin tone."
5,Pale and Pink,"I always have a difficult time finding the right color (either white-out or orange). This is wonderful on my pinky-fair skin tone. It provides enough coverage to sort out the nightmare under my eyes (circles so bad that I look like a victim of domestic violence),yet blends well. I have issues with hormonal skin... oily AND dry patches, so I always set this with mineral powder (faerie organics)to keep it from landing in the wrinkles around my eyes."
5,The best cover up ever,This is the best cover up ever made & it is getting very hard to find it. I am 51 years old & have tried many different cover ups over the years. seller was fantastic!
2,Needs more color options,"I got the lightest color and it is still to dark for my skin.. Looks almost orange on my face. I had high hopes for this product, but was highly disappointed instead."
3,I was a little disappointed..,"I'm 21 years old and I've had dark circles my whole life-- they're heriditary. I have never able to find a concealer to hide them, so I was really excited when I read the reviews for this stuff. I have medium/tan skin, so I ordered the ""light"" (as it was recommended to order a shade lighter than your skin for dark circles) and it's actually still too dark. The ""light"" isn't as light as I thought it would be and doesn't cover my circles very well. I'm kind of disappointed that I paid $13 for a ""miracle"" that doesn't really work for me.."
1,more like my spots still visible,Dont waste your money i have a purplish scar on my forehead from skin cancer this stuff wipes right off and does not conceal even a pimple ! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Not the Coverage it Claims to Give,"I purchased this product since I was looking to try something to cover my hyperpigmentation. I was already happy with a different product but I was trying to save a few dollars and at the same time give something else a try. I was not happy with the outcome. First of all, the product comes in a ""chapstick"" type of container and size so for my age spots, I have to use quite a lot of product. I used it before I applied my foundation and it just didn't give me the coverage my previous concealer did. I agree with the saying, ""cheaper isn't always better"" and will be going back to my previous concealer."
1,Is this book for the rich only????,"Although I have not read this book, with the price tag you can see why, I can't make myself believe that this book is worth this kind of money. And its price makes it unavailable to the public libraries where I live and I would like to study this work but I can't see this happening. I am sure this book is a good read but it aint worth this price. Any suggestions?slemaster@sprintmail.com"
4,"Goog Expansion, but...","This element it's great: it provide power to the iPAQ when it has no more batery and, of course, it let you attach devices like LAN and Modems (I'm using a 3Com LAN Card in order to see my e-mail account and to synchronize it with my Computer with ActiveSync.However when I tried to attach the Mini disc of Iomega (PocketZIP) doesn't work... and I read about the Dual Expansion Pack... it seems to be better than the single expansion pack and it provides mor time of power and lower consumption of power."
3,First Donkey Kong without Mario,"This is a fun game. That being said it is also a very limited game. Even for the time it does not offer variety. You'll end up playing this game for a few minutes before you will inevitably think, ""Is that all?"" The ""levels"" are almost identical. The game has no ending. You will ultimately be left unsatisfied from playing this title.Note: one of my ""overall"" stars comes solely from the ""Donkey Kong"" name."
3,Not like the first two games,"Stanley the Bugman's console debut was never as popular as Mario's starring in Donkey Kong and Jr, and for good reason.The game is a shooter in disguise as a limited platformer. The goal is to spray Donkey Kong up to the top of the vines he climbs with a bug sprayer, while also shooting distracting bugs that try to take away your flowers.When Stanley dies, he looks like as if he just died like how Mario does in Donkey Kong, but in the arcade version, that's not the case. In the original, bugs would swoop down, and eat off Stanley (Thankfully, there's no blood. His body just disappears) I can see why that was censored in the NES game.Unlike the first two games, Donkey Kong 3's levels are all identical, with just the color palliate changed."
1,Does not fit car even though it says it does on site,"Don't trust the sizes on the Auto lookup. Measure your current wipers before you order, this lookup does not work !!!"
5,mature music,"my all time favorite album, i play it almost everyday. if you are comtemplating the purchase of your first ella fitzgerald cd, this is great place to start. it is beautiful music that any adult listener can enjoy.a fine collection of jazz and pop standards sung with incredible beauty. it must have been a songwriters dream to have ella sing one of your compositions.she respects the melody and composers intentions while still improvising with taste and imagination.while difficult any cuts my favorites are there's a lull in my life, i tought about you and what's new. trust me, you will love it."
5,Lush Life,"The best lush Ella Fitzgerald album, orchestrations so creamy it's fattening to listen to it. For the best of the acoustic Ella get the duet lps with Ellis Larkins including her unforgettable ballad reading of ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"".""Like Someone"" isn't jazz really, it's velvety pop. But never just sound for the sake of sound, never mere surface noise. Ella F. remains supremely intelligent no matter what the setting is. She was the most versatle of her peers."
4,Music with emotion,Format: SACDHaving never heard Ella Fitzgerald before it was a delight to listen to a performer with real emotion in her voice. The original recordings must be fairly old by now so the quality of the album is very good considering the age. Whilst the mix is not up to the standard of other SACDs I own (hence the 4 stars) it is still an album worthy of being in my collection.
4,Joe D. on Ella,"This is vintage Ella. She is sultry with impeccable phrasing. She knows when to be peppy & when to be smooth & soft. The arrangements are lush and full blown with strings and brass. Her rendition of Midnight Sun is worth the cost of the album alone. I have been a fan of Ella for 50 years, and I continue to enjoy her music. Her voice, phrasing, enunciation, and timing are perfect. You will not be disappointed in this album."
4,all Happy Ending fans stop here!,"All right, so this isn't really a happy ending either. (the show wasn't really a 'happy ending' kind of series) The problem with Blake's 7, after this volume, is that it becomes ever darker and darker and more reliant upon needless violence to flesh out many of the stories to the required time. This is a pity, too, because Blake's 7 (up to this point) always seemed to me how the BBC would have done Star Trek, had they been asked to produce it. While it is fun, in a series, to see all your favorite characters 'doing it all again, one more time', watching the way that season 4 destroys the characters and everything that they've worked for almost makes one wish that the BBC hadn't extended the show the extra season. On the other hand, perhaps I am just being morbid. Watch the remaining episodes if you wish, but mark my words: it will all just end in tears."
2,Not-so-secret society.,"Let me ask you - if you ran a ""secret"" society, would you have your groups emblem cast in iron and set on a rooftop? No? Then, would you also consider this a ""secret"" society if evryone and their mother knew of it's existence? I didn't think so. Such is the first of many major flaws in this campy movie. The plot is interesting and if you can get past all of the fluff in this one - then you'll enjoy this movie.For myself, I found myself laughing at this one more than anything else. ""A skull above any other!"" What the heck does that mean?"
2,Too fantastical,"Interesting premise but carried to such fantastical extreme as to disabuse. The story deteriorates from a somewhat intriguing tale to imaginary nonsense. Director Cohen does say in his commentary that since nobody really knows what goes on in those ""secret"" societies at Yale, Harvard, etc. (and as a Harvard alum I have to add, nobody cares), Cohen and his colleagues could let their imaginations run free. Well, they did. Yale, meet the Addams Family and The Munsters. Morticia and Lurch are more believable than the Skullsters in this thing. Nicely photographed movie though, especially the ersatz Ivy League interiors, somewhat reminiscent of older edifices at the real Harvard. Kudos for cinematography. Thumbs down on plot. Thumbs up for Craig T. Nelson as Mandrake, Sr., a cad you come to relish hating."
4,Gets you thinking,"May not make the awards, but defintely gets you thinking about organizations and why you join and why they agree to accept you. Thought provoking."
2,Not too good,"The idea was probably good - try to make a movie allegedly based on the real-life secret society Skull & Bones (of which many politicians, including George W. Bush and his father, and numerous influential business people are members). Somewhere along the way, however, the train came off the tracks. This film makes the society and its actions hokey. If the filmmaker truly wanted the almost unbelieveable real story to come out, he should have made a documentary."
4,Not the typical teenage horror movie...,"This movie doesnt have all of the blood and gore, but it does have suspense. It has a few surprises and the ending comes out great. This is one of those all-of-the-pieces-come-together kind of films. It has good characters and not too many to get confused. The plot is well put together. It is a good movie to watch, although it is not the best horror film ever made. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but I think that there is just something missing to make it a five star movie."
4,At least I liked it,"I've seen a lot of bad reviews on here for this movie. And let me tell you, I'm a tough grader mainly because I'm planning on attending college to be a screenwriter/director, so I'm picky when it comes to movies. But The Skulls was one I enjoyed. It had a very quick pace, excellent plot, and a decent script. The acting was fairly good, with a few exceptions, but all in all I found this to be an enjoyable movie. No, not nearly good enough to snag any academy awards, but it's good choice for fast-paced, good action movie. If you liked Enemy of the State, you'll like this..."
3,Strangely compelling trash,"""The Skulls"" is your basic unbelievable thriller that unfortunately takes itself completely seriously!The only likeable character in the film is murdered early on, but still there is lots to enjoy and mock as we learn more about this secret society.But who can really dislike a film that features a crewing contest, the one-note keanu-ish performance of Joshua Jackson, a crewing contest, and zero plausiblity. Cheesy to the core."
3,a good popcorn movie.,"I ordered this from amazon a few days ago and recieved it today, its a fun ""popcorn thriller"" although i recall several scenes from the theatre that i didnt find on this DVD version (like when all the new members get there new cars, in the theatrical version ther was also a Ducati motorcycle sitting with the cars) this was completely missing from the DVD, so there abviously been some cutting.. still a enjoyable film,"
2,Based on a true secret society organization,"at Yale University known for producing multiple U.S. Presidents, CEOs, Tycoons, etc. However, this story doesn't document the group but rather loosely uses it as a storyline backdrop only. It probably will leave most people dissatisfied although it is fairly well played and can be tense at times."
3,AVERAGE BUT DULL !,THERES SOME SMART MOVES BY TEENAGERS VS. OLD SCULL MEMBERS.I WOULDN'T BUY IT IF I WAS YOU.I REGRET BUYING THIS MOVIE SO BAD.
2,"'Skulls' hits a nail, dead in the head.","I have gone to a museum and seen more life in a skull, than in the film The Skulls, a cheesy teen thriller about a college student who reluctanley gets into a secret society, named for the title, The Skulls and then procedes to find flaws in it, only then wanting to get out, and discovering the only way out, is to die. The only thing thats worth watching in this bore fest is Lesley Bibb, who we dont even get to see as much as we'd like. There is no suspence in this suspence, and no depth with the charactors, other than that they would pretty much do anything to get into a ""secret society."" The directings not all that bad, but it doesnt help, the actings not either, like i said with the exception of Bibb, and the writings not even all that swell. The Skulls did resemble a teenage version of The Firm, which was a way better film all together, but what can you expect from the whole set of the WB. Just kidding."
1,Horrible [movie] - Staying Awake Has Never Been Harder,"Wow, I thought that the whole secret soceities idea might make a cool movie, but I was quite wrong. I mean, come on, horrible script, worse acting, and how long is this movie anyway? It seemed many hours passed under the torture of one retarded scene after another. The only plus, if you can call it that, is that you can laugh at the moronic dialogue and situations that arise. Even funnier ... is that this movie actually takes itself seriously."
4,"""Whoa. Weird...""","THE SKULLS (2000, PG-13 For Some Brief Strong Language)THE GENRE: Suspense/ThrillerTHE CAST: Joshua Jackson, Paul Walker and Craig T. Nelson.THE PLOT: After a teen is accepted into a secret society known as THE SKULLS, his life is ripped apart after his soul mate kills his best friend. Now (Joshua Jackson) is trying to get out of SKULLS, but it is going to be a lot harder than getting in was.WHAT WORKS: An interesting plot with thrills and suspense.WHAT DOESN'T: A strange- yet interesting plot with cliches and unbelievable turns.OVERALL: ""It takes a mind boggler to watch a movie like this and really enjoy. To the average audience- they might think this film is stupid and has no point. Yet- the film is undeniably thrilling."""
2,Suitable for cable,"A forgettable product, a weak effort by director Rob Cohen. Joshua Jackson is disappointing as the lading character in this movie about a ""secret"" society where everybody knows who is a member or not !!! The accepted members erceive twenty thousand dollars on the spot and spend it withno low-profile at all !! A bad movie, no doubt, but you can watch it if you're totally out of options."
4,Surprised,"George W. Bush and his dad are both ""Skulls"" which is the only reason I watched the movie. I'm not sure if I want a select group of people running my country, but then again I don't want the arrogance and bully features Gore embodies. After watching the movie, I can only hope that Bush will do the right things if he is elected instead of trying to advance the ""Skulls"" agenda unless it's for the good of the people. May 'someone' help us all."
2,A JOKE ..,"This movie is a joke. IT's not a movie to make you feel anger, but definitely is a bad production. The plot is so full of holes I could not believe it! Acting is poor from beginning to end ( it's sad to see McDonald, one of the actors from ""THELMA & LOUISE"", in it ). The funniest part is to know that the ""SKULLS"" are highly secret. But the new recruited students accepted into it each receives a brand new Porsche, Ferrari, Thunderbird or whatever !!! Second funniest part is to know that the society is so well-organized that their leaders keeps a tape showing a cold murder is the same place and manner as all the others surveillance tapes they have !!! The duel sequnce in the end almos made me laugh, I thought it was a comedy. As for Joshua Jackson acting, forget it..."
1,What happened to Pacey?,"This movie stinks. I mean, it really does. It is a bad WB television movie gone wrong. The actors seem to know this also.Do not buy this. Rent it if you'd like..but you have been warned."
3,[Three-and-a-half out of five] Updated attempt to copy Brotherhood of the Bell!,"Modern day attempt at old time exposeof Secret Societies / Fraternity andnot bad at all. Except for excessiveprofanity in orginal print that willkeep some otherwise favorabley impressedaway. TV version has a bit cleaned up.Supposed to be about Bush/Clinton/Gore/Robertson cult known at Yale Universityas Skull and Bones. Good bit of researchdone by Hollywood Director, but nowherenear as effective as Oliver Stone's JFKor Michael Moore's best (Fahrenheit 9/11or Roger and Me). Good effort nonetheless!For a new generation, who better take thisas a warning. See also: Alexandra Robinson'sbooks!"
3,A plot that had so much to explore!,"Uneven and confused thriller about the lives and risks of a Secret Society and a very young student who is recruited to join them. Some twists and turns here and there but with evident narrative holes that demerit the final balance. Craig T. Nelson and William Petersen do their best they can with this predictable script.Nevertheless, there are some intriguing moments that may justify its rent for a rainy weekend."
2,Who DOES this remind you of?,"Lightweight film, but interesting premise. The sons of wealthy, powerful families get inducted into an Ivy League secret society. In return for a vow of mutual lifetime assistance, they get all sorts of advantages (expensive cars, grad school admissions, forgivable student loans, old boy network at the highest levels of society).Best of all, their darkest secrets are whitewashed, covered up, and forgotten.Darned if this doesn't remind us of a skull currently running for president."
2,It's no mystery,"This film lacks any of the suspense or intensity that makes good thrillers memorable. Cohen claims it is a message film aimed at teenagers headed toward college. The message I took away from it is find a better script before you start making your movie or it will wind up like this -- hackneyed and predictable.There are plenty of implausibilities and downright silliness, not to mention groaners in the dialogue and some serious over-acting.But if you think this movie is bad, just check out the sequel..."
3,???,Good movie. Good plot. Really three and a half stars. It's a little predictable. I would have liked it more if the ending was clearer. I had more questions when the movie ended than when it began. Was anyone punished for the murder? What happened to the kid who tried to kill himself???
1,The Skulls,"I am a William L. Petersen fan, But if I had a choice on watching this video again or being bashed in the skull. I would take the skull bash thank you very much."
2,SKULLS - IT WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH OR BE ANGER,"This movie is mean, man ...!!! It was clearly made with the best of intentions: a history about a Secret Society and a young man ( Jackson in his worst performance ever ) trying to get out of it. But the execution of the screenplay is so bad that all is lost..."
3,Great movie for Josh Jackson fans,"I am a big Josh Jackson fan and altho the story had big holes in it, I really enjoyed it. It's a fun movie and I think overanalyzing it takes the fun out of it. It's not a GREAT movie... but it's a pretty good one.Josh did a great job portraying the underdog who realizes things are not at all what he thought. He sets to make things right. There's action and suspense. The cast really seems to enjoy working together.I love Josh Jackson's work and if it was truly horrible, I never would have been able to sit through it, much less buy the DVD to watch over again.It's a must-see for Josh Jackson fans. The extra scenes at the end of the DVD were enough to make my purchase worthwhile.This was Josh Jackson's first lead-role in a feature film (I think). I look forward to his future projects."
5,DELICOUS,"AS ALL OF THEIR PRODUCTS, THIS IS ALWAYS FRESH AND OF GOOD QUALITY. I HAVE TRIED GROWING MYSELF BUT IT IS NEVER THIS GOOD! AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT FOR THAI COOKING."
4,LEMONGRASS LOVER,"So, I placed my order Oct.30. They arrived in my mailbox 10 days later,very appropriately wrapped and in good health. I was very surprised to find that they came directly from Thailand to my home in Florida. Whenever I travel overseas I like to sneak cutting or seeds in my suitcase and worry about getting caught by immigration who hate for us to import vegetation. Apparently customs passed the lemongrass without any problems!!! Yeah!!Anyway, as soon as they arrived I unpacked the 8 stalks and stuck them in water. Today is 5 days later and all of the stalks have started to sprout!!!!I am so thrilled with this and look forward to seeing the fresh leaves pop out from the top. I plan to plant these so I can enjoy a lifetime of this wonderful fresh, therapeutic herb. Thanks Franz Market for a job well done and for making me a happy little camper :) GOD BLESS!"
3,when a lot is too much,The lemon grass was too much for me to use at one time. I don't know if I could freeze it. I wasn't too thrilled with the look of some of it.
2,Too cluttered,"As a beginnng Spanish student, I find the book cluttered and overwhelming. Also, a more organized approach to the subject would help. My foreign language background is French, so I am familiar with how to study a different language."
4,"Okay for studying in a class, not online.","This book could be very educational...except if you're using it for an online class as I am. When I originally bought this book, I bought the audio sections with it. The book itself is very difficult to learn anything from unless you have the CD's to go with it. I also feel like it is geared toward high school students rather than college students, but that could just be my preference in styles. Overall, the book is a good book if you can learn from it and ignore the elementary style of the pictures, etc."
2,Workbook had completed answers,The first 40 pages of the workbook had allready been completed in pen which made it very difficult to use.
2,Not satisfied with the book.,"Well, initially when I got the book everything looks good until the day I began to use the book for class asignment. I found that the pre chapter and chapter 1 was teared out. I'm dissapointed because I can't use the book anymore."

1,Buy something else,"Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this book. It starts out as the dream novel every baseball fan has been wishing for since ""Shoeless Joe."" But, it quickly disintegrates into a story of friendship, true love, self-indulgence, and over-the-top cliche baseball drama.Another reviewer spoke of misspelled street names - even worse Mark McGwire's name is spelled incorrectly twice (McGuire - what MS Word suggests as the correct spelling). How can anyone respect a baseball book that spells a Hall of Famer's name wrong twice - what's next Babe Rooth?"
2,A Career Minor Leaguer?,"Being partial to the Red Sox, and catchers, I thought this might be the one. The book has a promising start as Casey Fox and his Boswell Russ first cross paths at a college baseball game, and it continues to fulfill the potential for quite some time but ultimately sputters out, like a minor leaguer who gets hung up at the AA level. There is much to like, including the exploration of the Red Sox conundrum and the state of the Game, but it unfortunately veers into the pedantic. Two of the main characters are drawn well enough to hold the reader's interest, but the female lead is flat, a disappointment."
3,A 55 Foot Curveball,"Although the list of quality of adult baseball fiction is regrettably short, I really thought this might have have a chance. It starts out quite well- phenom, disaffected writer and his conscience and has some humor to it, but, it runs out of steam in the second half of the book with a lot of pontificating and self rightous indignation.Most unfortunotely, there is the inevitable ""BIG GAME"". Why must every baseball fiction writer use the same cliche? Still, in all, it's better than most and certainly worth a read"
5,If i were a rich man,"Overall, I like this product. I have tried it both inside and outside of the house and on the road. I guess I was hoping for a little more range out of it. They are pretty lightweight and the looks arn't bad. I couldn't quite get the 2 miles range that it says it has. But hey, for the price you can't beat these things anywhere. They are great. It was coolBig Truck"
1,Not Impressed,"I recently receive this product...and I am not pleased. I am getting a lot of feedback from the unit which is picked up on other radios. The problem? An overly sensitive microphone on the unit. My recomendation? Go with a Motorola, Midland, or Audiovox."
5,good to the last drop,"a very good book. from the very beginning you're wondering what exactly is going on and what's the deal with the other guests of mountolive's mansion. it was also made into a movie which follows the books plot almost exactly, rare these days. if you can find this at a used bookstore or something, i highly recomend it."
3,"From screenplay to novel, sort of","This book is a ""novelization"" of the screenplay and was published to coincide with the release of the movie. On its own, it's a routine thriller of the supernatural variety with excursions into black magic and satanism, but comparing and contrasting it with the movie version does offer a few points of interest. In general, the movie deviates from its own screenplay at its very end in an attempt to soften the Katharine Ross character and make her more of a conventional heroine. This actually weakens the story and makes it even less plausible. Routine though it is, this book actually provides a better, more consistent story. As for the movie, its chief point of interest is Sam Elliott's totally gratuitous but oh-so-welcome nude scene. Too bad this book didn't come illustrated with photographs showing off Sam's great set of buns."
4,An Engaging Read,I've heard so much of Rip Van Winkle and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow over the years that this is the reason I purchased the book. I'm working up in the Catsilll Mountains at the moment and wanted to read something that related to the area. This book is far more than the Catskill Mountains as it discusses many of his ventures in England. I found this book to be engaging and heartfelt. I'm happy to finally know more about Washington Irving and his experiences.
2,VERY POOR redo,"Nice if you're part of the generation that uses smart phones and can read things w/o magnifying glasses. Bought this book for my uncle who enjoys WI's short stories, but couldn't read it. They need to go back to the drawing board on this one and UPSIZE the repro'd pages to the SIZE OF THE PAGE, NOT A DOWNSIZED SNAPSHOT.I would not recommend this book. But not due to its content, just its poorly done implementation. I gave it 2 stars instead of one for preserving the original content, but if based only on implementation, a BIG FAT ZERO would be the only appropriate rating!"
1,The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories,"The book that I read was called The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories. The author of the book was Washington Irving. I thought that was book wasn't that great. That depends on if you don't mind an old-fashioned type of language that they spoke. I thought that the book was a little too complicated for me because I didn't understand what the people were saying sometimes.I thought that the actual theme of the book was pretty good, but otherwise I didn't really care for it that much.I'd reccomend this book to anyone who ever read the actual verson of Sleepy Hollow and liked the story.By,Andy C."
4,An Under-appreciated Gem,"Washington Irving's Sketch Book is not only a literary document, with more import than just what literary scholars can glean, but also an ambitious work by a young author. Like reading any first work, observing the chances Irving takes with these articles and stories is revealing and rewarding.Sketch Book has more than just scary tales, like Sleepy Hollow, but also has travel pieces, period literary criticism, and insightful social analyses. Irving honestly contrasts British and Continental cultures with nascent American currents. The theme of the book is the uniqueness of American culture, but also its continuities with European trends. The Sketch Book is commentary on a very ambitious scale. It is a model for anyone writing a travel memoir, either non-fiction or fictionalized.Irving's style is also very ornate, but economical and organized, and his range of subjects is vast. Any one interested in 19th-century history or culture will find this independent work revealing."

5,Excellent!!! Buy or Die!,"If you're looking for a laptop with a good balance between price, performance and work, there's the one! It can provide you the best typing experience, 100% confortable, easily hot, and it even runs the most complicated games with HQ graphics!Plus, it's a good student PC..."
5,How Fun!,"My older son picked up a copy of this graphic novel at a library book sale. It's been languishing around the house for a few years. A week ago, it turned up on the kitchen table. On a lark, I picked it up and started reading it. I was immediately sucked in.While I'm not much on graphic novels, this one is well done. It's well drawn, the dialogue (and monologue) is first-rate, and the wit is, well, dripping.I'm happy I read it -- I had a blast. Now I need another cup of coffee, I think. While I find the pot, you go find this book and read it."
5,A Refreshing Blend,"Having listened to this CD and having the pleasure of knowing Charmaine, I felt inspired and very lighthearted. My writer's block went away and I was able to complete a crucial chapter in my book. The melodic blends of the guitar coupled with her voice and lyrics left me feeling as if I was living through each vivid picture of her songs.""Better in the Morning"" left me anticipating the next time I will experience ""lovin' in the morning."" It is a refreshing change to the commercial music on the radio today. Radio should take notice. Charmaine is on her way. May God continue to bless you, Charmaine."
2,disappointing sound quality,"This recording was made...so it says in the enclosed booklet...in 1930's and the sound is very disappointing. While the Mefistofele is wonderful with his rich, dark and sometimes over the top singing, the rest of the cast is so so. The soprano especially. At times she has a beautiful tone but mostly is screechy. Spend the extra money and get a newer cd."
3,"Great, but a few catches.","BGO has been wonderful about releasing all Johnny Rivers' LPs in 2-for-1 style. This was a surprise to see released, and a welcome one too, but a few things should be noted.""And I Know You Wanna Dance"" is in MONO, for some reason the stereo tapes were not used, and ""Revisited"" masters were obviously in rough shape as there are warbles and drop-outs throughout that section of the CD. Large booklet enclosed, but nothing in detail about these 2 albums, more of a JR bio.The CD came with a wrap around it, simply the CD artwork, same as on the inserts. Perhaps they could have skipped this and lowered the price of the CD a bit more, accordingly.Minor complaints aside...I'm still thrilled to have it in my collection."
2,Live Rivers Albums,AndI know You Wanna Dance is Rivers best live album.Too bad it was released in mono.Unexcusable period.After all this is the 21st centry.I let the record company know about this and told them they should be ashamed putting out what sounded like to me a boot-legged copy.I was told that the legal department was interested.I e-mailed the gentleman back and gave him my address.The other album I bought it for 98 cenat in 1971.It has some good material on it but it's a through in.I wouldn't pay this much money for this product.
5,Beautiful Love Story,"""In Passing"" is a beautiful film for both women and men. A lovely and somewhat sad love story set in New York City.Although it tells the story of two women who fall in and out of love, the plot is universal and will resonate with anyone who has been in a relationship.The film style is both reflective and daring, with fully-shown sex scenes between the two main women characters.In addition, the movie features a lot of great music. I hope they release the soundtrack as a CD!"
2,Feels like a Grade-C film school project,"This production is not only an example of bad indie filmmaking, but Fitzgerald appears to have taken her film class lectures on the use of slow motion and stop motion a little too close to heart. With this mash, the library of lesbian cinema gets another addition to the bulging shelf of plots about unfaithful, betraying women -- a theme that seems to have become almost mandatory for the genre. And in what guide to creating low-budget lesbian theme films is the chapter that suggests it's a good idea to also add a soundtrack of embarrasingly second-rate songs? The whole production feels as if it was slapped together from disjointed takes and in some scenes Veronica Mittenzwei looks tired and aged. Kate Clinton's brief appearance isn't simply wasted, it's also monotonous. Sit through this if you must (at the least you'll learn what not to do if you should feel an urge to make your own video quickie)."
3,confusing,This one was a bit confusing and not at all what I expected. Also Kate Clinton was in it for like 2 seconds.
1,Probably the worst film I've ever seen,"Not quite sure why I watched this all the way through - really wish I hadn't. Full of cliches and incredibly predictable. The chemistry between the two leads was good, but the rest was pure crap. Sorry, those who worked on this film. Just my opinion."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Horrible movie. I actually laughed a lot, but it's not supposed to be a comedy. The acting was terrible, storyline bad, the way the movie was shot was supposed to be ""arty"" but just ended up looking like a 10 year old child did the camera work. I only gave it one star for a rating because they won't let you review an item without one. If they had a zero star rating, that's what it would get. I am sorry I wasted my money on it."
3,Contents have all appeared in the New Yorker,"Before you buy this book you may want to know that all of its contents have appeared in the New Yorker magazine. If you (as I) rarely find yourself doubled over with amusement by New Yorker fiction, you may want to take some of the more enthusiastic reviews with a grain of salt. On the other hand if you get a big kick out of the psychopathology of everyday life in New York city, then you may find this book very amusing"
2,One-trick-pony fiction with a truly annoying protagonist,"I bought this book on the strength of the NY Times review and regretted it. The perspective and appeal of these stories are very narrow. I found myself bored with the privileged, neurotic protagonist and her comments on the inconveniences of modern life for the upper classes. A search for organic coffee in the Hamptons does not great fiction make. This territory has been covered by other New York writers and entertainers (notably Jerry Seinfeld) in a much more imaginative and entertaining fashion. Laugh out loud funny? It's not. The quality of the writing is unexceptional and does not redeem the one-trick-pony story line"
3,"Boring, incoherent","When I read the reviews of this book on Amazon, I decided I couldn't even wait the day or two it would take to order the book, so I took the subway down to Barnes & Noble to get it. What a waste of time! It's not funny. . . just a little weird and incoherent. I found myself constantly checking how many pages I had left before I was finished with a story. Don't bother with this one, unless you're having too much excitement in your life and desperately want a break from it"
3,"Wait, it gets better","I searched out this book at Amazon after reading a short story of hers in Harper's (May 99) that I thought was extraordinary. I found the book to be mildly disappointing. It didn't connect to much of a world beyond the narrator's neurotic, effete existence, which became tiresome. As good as the writing was, she wasn't telling us much about life beyond the pedestrian inanities of a dipsomaniacal, class-bound Yankee life. But that more recent short story certainly did connect to more thoughtful concerns, and I've come to see this first collection of short stories as evidence of the author's larval stage (this is what I hope to be true). She really is a distinctly humorous writer of increasing precision and I look forward to whatever comes next."
1,Dreadful,"Awful, unfunny, poorly written. The book's sole redeeming quality is its pretty cover.Can't imagine why there was a sequel. Can't bear to imagine how bad her Andy Kaufman book must be.Yuck."
1,MIGHT WORK WELL ON PAPER,"OK.. Lets face it. A broken bolt or screw is a pretty bad place to start out. I bought this set along with a more expensive bolt remover design. Neither this set nor the more expensive bolt remover design did the trick. I was able to remove the bolt the old fashion way... by drilling through the entire bolt which takes time, effort and patience. Had i just started out with this remedy in mind, i would have saved money, time and wasted expectations. While the design of these tools may work well enough on paper... they certainly did not work on the metal embedded bolt."
1,Broken and Ignored,"This item was stated as new. The case was broken. The items inside were ok, but this was NOT NEW. I called the company who sold them 3 times and got an answer machine all 3 times. My calls were never returned. I will NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN and dont suggest others do either. Amazon was going to refund, but it was just for a broken case and I didnt want to bother. Just shows that the company selling is NOT a good company and should not be a representative of Amazon.com."
2,"Superb book, bad edition","Godfrey Lienhardt's Divinity and Experience is a classic and sensitive ethnography of Dinka religious life. This 2003 paperbook reprint by Clarendon (Oxford University Press), however, does a great disservice to Lienhardt by eliminating the plates that were present in previous editions! Plus, the $95 list price is borderline criminal. I would give this edition zero stars for omitting the plates and the exorbitant price, but out of respect for Linhardt's magnificent work, I am giving a rating of two stars in order to spare him the indignity of a lowest possible rating. Do yourselves a favor and buy a cheap used copy of this edition or pay the few extra dollars for an earlier edition that includes the plates."
3,"Definitely soothing, but repetitive","I am not a musician, and not a very sophisticated listener, just enjoy music. Selected this album because it did sound soothing. But the first several songs almost blurred, they sounded so similar. Have not gone all the way through the album. Would have like a little more variation in the pieces."
5,Just Frickin' Swell,"I believe the best thing about this CD is it's diversity, there's Funky, there's Cajun, Rock, Rockabilly, Blues, Covers, Big Band sounds and of course a good baseline throughout also some nice piano and horn work. I usually have a favorite CD du jour but this one lasted a week! I'm listening to it as I type.You can't go wrong here. I hesitate to rate things a 5 but I think it is."
5,An intriguing discussion and convincing argument emerges,"Numerous titles have explored how species evolved; but there's not a single example among them of species arising by a gradual accumulation of random gene mutations. Acquiring Genomes poses a new theory of development, maintaining that individual gene mutations are minor events and that big evolutionary changes occur when different types of organisms merge with their genomes - all the genes they possess. An intriguing discussion and convincing argument emerges."
2,REHASH OF PREVIOUS POP-SCIENCE BOOKS ON EVOLUTION,"THIS IS A SHORT REVIEW FOR A SHORT BOOK. THE MATERIAL PRESENTED IS NOT ONLY A BRIEF AND SOMEWHAT UNINSPIRED REHASH OF POP-EVOLUTION BOOKS AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE, BUT WOULD APPEAR TO BE A REHASH OF SOME OF HER PREVIOUS BOOKS. SAME THEORIES, BUT WITH A FEW NEW EXAMPLES. DEFINITELY NOT INSIGHTFUL. IF YOU'VE READ SOME OF HER PREVIOUS BOOKS ON EVOLUTIONARY THEORY, OR OTHER GOOD POP-SCIENCE BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT (LIKE GOULD,DAWKINS, ETC), THEN YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO READ THIS ONE. I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHY THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN. THIS NON-FICTION NICHE IS ALREADY OVERWHELMED WITH SIMILAR MATERIAL."
3,"If there's no better symbiogenesis book, there should be","I recommend this book for (re-)presenting the wonderful but ignored idea that speciation is largely driven by the combination of separate species' DNA. However, the book is a tough read. It is incoherent at times, both because the author uses arcane biological terms without defining them and because the book lacks a well-defined structure and purpose."
2,They almost had me fooled ...,"I was almost ready to seriously consider Margulis' and Sagan's revolutionary theory until I read Sagan's update, in which he writes ""Because chromosome arrangements differ slightly in closely related mammal species (e.g., dogs and wolves) that no longer breed with each other ...""Everybody knows that wolves and domestic dogs CAN breed. You can buy wolf/dog hybrids from breeders such as http://www.dogpage.us/wolfdogs.htm.If one of the authors is this removed from common sense, I wonder about the rest of the theory. And I wonder if his mother knows what he's up to."
3,Great heavy duty shear BUT...,"These are a great heavy duty grass shear, but NOT UNTIL I cut the handle tension spring down. Before that, they absolutely wore my hands out. So I popped out the spring, and cut off a couple rings of the spring, reinserted, sharpened them, and adjusted the blade overlap & they have worked great ever since. But out of the box they need work."
5,"could not get listed book,read on...","Recomend Powered Paragliding Pilot Training Manual By Andre"" S. Rossin-Arthiat, Canadian author. Good information, gives a good idea just what is involved. I recomend it,"
4,Thought provoking......,"Good quick read. It deals with though provoking situations and makes you wonder how you might react if in their shoes. I am all about getting to the story and skipping lots of the fluffy stuff - however, with this book - I felt like there were time when I was rushed in the story line."
2,A truthful review,"Cannery Row was a poor example of John Steinbeck's work.John Steinbeck wrote many great books, but this one did not keep my interest. I realized that during the depression was a really hard time for people, one book is enough for the topic of the depression. I believe if I had to get some sleep then I would just read this book. The one great thing aboout this book is that it showed human kindness to others no matter what their profession is."
2,Cannery Row,"My opinion of the book is that is was too long and extremely too boring. It kept going to different subjects it made no sense at all. But there were some good parts in the book, like how everyone wanted to do something go for Doc. Mack and the boys were respected by everyone in Cannery Row they were like the town bums."
2,Cannary [row] ( Cannary row),"Cannery row wasn't in my words the most exciting book I have ever read(throwing slabs of meat against a wall would of been more amusing), but it wasn't the worst book I have ever been forced to absorb(The giver). If you're an adventure seeking reader(like me)this book is probally not for you....especialy if you're forced to read it for english class! Perhaps if the writter had worded the book a little differently it would of been better...*stops and thinks*(possibly...not...)*sweet drop*. Now that I'm done slammin on the book I might as well not scare you off to bad(you poor souls who have to suffer as I have)! There is one interesting part in the book, its the part where Mack and da boys get drunk and trash Doc's place! thats all I'm telling you! Your gonna have to tape your eyelids open and read it yourself!!!*laughs maliciously*"
2,Nice descriptions of Montery Bay area and little else.,"Nice descriptions of the Monterey Bay area where the book takes place and very realistic characters is about all you'll get from this work of Steinbeck's. What's missing is a story. The main focus is on the efforts of some bums to do something nice for Doc, a kind but lonely marine biologist who was apparently based on Steinbeck himself, but the book meanders from that plot line through stories about a Chinese grocery man, a quasi-French painter, a slightly bats housewife, a madam and her suicidal pimp, among many others. The only thing they really have in common is where they take place. They are all largely boring. And then in the end, you do indeed wonder what the point was. THIS is a classic?"
1,I didn't like this book,"I had to read this book for school, and it was no fun. amspacherb@pgcs.com, I actually didn't laugh hysterically at the beer milkshake--I thought it was stupid. Sorry. Greg B. from CA--I'd have to agree with you. No plot, no main characters...the only good part was the poem."
1,Book review of cannery row,"Personaly,I did not like the book cannery row.The book was not action packed enugh for me.The carectors were very boring and didnt have much meaning to their lives.The book also jumped arond a lot and i didnt like that because it took my consentration off the main plot of the story and i got lost and it was very confusing for me.I though the auther needed to use a wider rang of vocabulary in the story as well.I would not recamend this book to many people, it is nonsenes."
3,Just a LITTLE Favor,"This book was so and so. One aspect of the book that I enjoyed was that the way Steinbach described evetything so vividly in detail. No detail escaped with out being mentioned. Overall the book was about a small place on the coast and the people that where living there. It first went into developing the characters and then gets into the main character, Doc. Doc is always trying to help everyone and offering his help. Throughout the whole book everyone is trying to repay or give back to Doc because the people of Cannery Row feel that they own Doc something. The people come up with a plan to throw him a party, but the plan backfires and Docs' house ends up getting messed up the party has a negative reaction. In the end all ends well and feeling are patched up. I guessed what I learned was that trying repay a favor doesn't take much, just a little acknowledgement"
4,Cannery Row is bold by its extreme subtlety.,"Cannery Row is one of the boldest books ever written bySteinbeck due in large part to its subtlety. The fact that the entirenovel revolves around Mack and the boys and their attempt tothrow Doc a party is an example of this. Aside from proving thecliche, ""it's the thought that counts,"" Cannery Row shows that theiris a little good in all of us."
3,"Hate to oppose the tide, but....","Sorry, but CR is not the essential Steinbeck. It is a fairy tale where everyone is happy, there is damage but no pain, and CR is a sort of Eden where the salt of the earth ... bums and whores and biologists ... live together in harmony. I have discussed CR with a friend whose favorite author is Steinbeck. He describes it as Steinbeck's problemmatical novel, a reaction to WWII and to the intensity of his earlier work. He reports that Steinbeck was disturbed when critics and readers asked him what CR was about; Steinbeck said it was evident. It wasn't to me.My buddy has talked me into reading ""Sweet Thursday"". He promises it will be a sequel to CR. He tells me that there will be some darkness where CR is all light. He tell me that the same characters and their substitutes will show some warts instead of being inherently good and fine, if a bit unpolished.CR is a fun, comic read, but it isn't great literature and it is a Steinbeck anomoly."
3,awesome writer ... blah storyline,John Steinbeck is incredible at giving vivid pictures through using words.I felt like a watched a movie from reading this book.the story never really goes anywhere and its a short read.i guess when u read a steinbeck novel you need to focus on the symbolisms and analogies rather than the actual stories.
4,Cannery Row review,"I my opinion Cannery Row is good book. I liked it better than Of Mice and Men. It held my attention while i was reading it, and i didn't notice any real dry spots. Somthing was always going on in the busy town of Cannery Row. On thing i liked about the book is that it jumped around with little side stories. I thought that kept it interesting. It wasn't like the book dragged on constently on the same old plot. It is definatly a active book with alot going on but thats why i liked it."
4,The Review,I think Cannery row was a pretty descent book. It had some unforgetable characters and some great stories within the story. Steinbeck did a really good job describing an interesting setting and telling you a story that kept you intrigued. This has been the only book I've read in school that I've actually enjoyed.
5,Amazing ability to write!,"I cried at the end, and then read it again and cried again. Beautiful and amazing, and don't ask me how because the subject of the story is not really all that interesting! John S. is one of the greatest talents of all time."
4,"A ""Must-Read""","While there isn't much in the way of a ""plot"" in this book, I still consider this a must-read. Steinbeck has an uncanny ability to put a sentence together in the most perfect way possible.The ""story"" is not a traditional story per-se, but rather, it is the story of the area at the time... a ""slice of life"" look at an interesting place at interesting point in time. It's a loosely related collection of short stories. The book accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is to give the reader a sense of the lives of the people who lived in Cannery Row during the Depression.The characters are colorful but still human and as I noted before, the writing is superb."
3,My Review,I think this was a pretty good book. It would have been a lot better if it wouldn't have changed main characters so much. I like books that only have a few main characters. I didn't understand the the plot to the story. there was no meaning to the story it was just a small town that loves to throw parties. The only problem is that no one has any money.
4,Cannery Row Review for Ms. Shannons class.,"In my opinion, i think that Cannery Row is a really good book. It was very interesting and it never got boring. I enjoyed reading this book and i thought that none of the chapters were boring. I thought that this book was realistic. The only thing that I didn't like about this book was how it ended. I thought that the ending would be a little more intersting."
5,Forever Steinbeck,"Every bit as good as when I first read it over 40 years ago, well written characterization superb and thoroughly amusing."
3,The mind of the disturbed,"I read this book...I like Steinbeck as an author,however Cannery Row did not impress me in all the possible ways that it could...I find that this book had no major action in it...However that does not mean it had no psychological point of views shown to the reader through the eyes of the characters..."
3,timo's review,I think the book is pretty good. I like most about it that steinbeck describes the characters very good . I don't like that every chapter has to do wth something else. for example from doc's 2nd surprise party to the gopher who trys to find a new home. i lke that the story is in realism and deals with real situations. while you read the book you kind of move into montery and see the daily life of the people and their feelings.timo
3,Cannery Row Review,"I thought Cannery Row was alright. I like a book with more excitement. I like to read a book with suspense which I don't think Cannery Row had too much of. It had a different outlook on what we would call normal everyday life than we do. I think the characters in the book didn't care if they were doing what some normal person would do but what they thought was best. They got through life not how others wanted them to but how they wanted to themselves. They just wanted to have fun and deal with life day by day as it comes. I agree with their outlook on life and how they emotionally go about it, but I don't agree with the way they lived and their surroundings. I definetly would have tried to get out of there and find a nicer place to live. But I understand all they did and why they live how they live."
5,My favourite book-bar none!,"I have never read a book that so richly paints the thoughts,dreams,loves and fears of its characters. A true classic, a must read for anyone who appreciates literature."
5,A great portrayal of the importance of community!,"In school, most students are forced to read some boring books that their teachers call ""classics."" But of course most students don't fully grasp the meaning of most of the books. When I was forced to read Cannery Row, I thought, oh no, not another book. But, during the course of reading this piece, I found that the book made me think. Cannery Row deeply described the importance of the community around you. And in doing so, I came to realize that not everything should relvove around an individual. The people around you help to make you who you are. They are the ones to shape your perspective. Cannery Row portrays this excellently. It is a great book, that all people, not just students should read."
2,Disappointing,"This is the seventh Steinbeck novel I have read, and also one of the worst (The Short Reign of Pippin the VII is worse). I loved The Red Pony and Of Mice of Men, so I branched out, reading some of his lesser known works. Big Mistake. This novella has no focus, no character you can relate to, no plot to speak of, no definitive climax, and no business being read. I daydreamed through most of it.The reason I don't give it one star is because Steinbeck, like in most of his novels, provided a great description of post-war Cannery Row, and did a decent job of presenting violence on the periphery (kind of like the news today). We see glimpses of violence but we, nor the characters are ever directly affected. Furthermore, the novel's ending is decent, comparing Doc's lonely isolation to that of a gopher being attacked while trying to seek out a mate. Unfortunately, most things leading up until the ending is uneventful, constantly interrupted by dead-end subplots, and lacking in intrigue."
5,Simple Pleasure,"Cannery Row...A delightful little book filled with justabout every ""plot twist"" known to man.I was reminded of Voltaires ""Candide"",numerous Greek tragedies, triangle relationships.At the end of the day?The road to hell is paved with good intentions.Surprise is not always welcome.No good deed goes unpunished.Don't be afraid to ask for help.""Darling"" the dog is what brings themback together.Never underestimate the power of animalsin our life.Hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.I loved its gentle prose, despite what weall knew Doc was doing.He gathered animals to kill, sent them offto universities, schools, to be dissectedfor medical purposes.Did any of you get that?Or is it just me?Just my take.Enjoy the book.It is a beautiful journeythrough simple live, unfetteredby wealth, nor the pursuit of...BestH."
2,A row of cans,"Cannery Row is an okay book. I think Steinbeck threw in some unwanted and confusing chapters. If those chapters had more substance to the plot then it would be better. Out of the books I have read in school this is one of my least favorite, but not as least as the Great Gatsby. But in the book I did like the characters Mack and the boys, I liked how they were had no cares. Doc was also another likeable character. Because he was nice and like to try new things. Plus he was forgiving but sometimes to forgiving which I think is a big weakness."
2,Cannery Row review,"This book was ok. One reason i didn't like it all that much really had nothing to do with the book itself, it is because any book in school i read i don't like it. So i guess that is not a really good reson for not liking the book. I'm not to sure that i liked Steinbecks way of writing. He would have odd chapters in there that didn't go with the story line. It threw me off. Then again some of those chapters were were kinda cool.If you are tired of reading the odinary kinda book and are looking for a change i say read Cannery Row. I myself woould not recomend this book."
2,BORING,"Steinbeck spends far too much time describing the setting instead of a plot. I kept waiting and waiting for ANYTHING to happen and nothing did. Although interesting in the first two chapters, you quickly get sick of the disjointed ""plot"". A vivid setting does not make up for the absence of a story."
2,Slow and pointless,"I have read several of Steinbeck's other works. They are generally good. This book, although, is slow moving and has several irrelevant chapters thrown in. The ending is definitely not what I expected."
5,A wonderful and toching book.,This book is a wonderful book. It shows a society that we would not look at and Steinbeck puts such a nice story behind his description. A rare litterary treasure
5,good book for everyone,"i thought this would be a stupid book becuz we had to read it for an english class, but it was actually pretty interesting. i read to the end before the class, for once"
5,Small but Wonderful!,"This is a small and quick read, but it is wonderful. I read it first in high school and then again in college and then maybe three times since just for the joy of it. Most anything Steinbeck is great, but this is a gem!!!"
3,danny's review,this is my review. I though the book was well though out and was a good book for kids to read. it show you if you stick together things will go your way.
2,LACKING,BEEN THERE AND THE BOOK WAS SOMEWHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. NEEDED MORE INTERESTING STORY FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL PLACE. MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WILL WRITE A BETTER BOOK ABOUT THE PLACE.
3,No emotional attachments,"I enjoyed parts of this book, but it did not draw me in nor give me any emotional attachments to the characters. It seemed to be divided into shorter stories that make up the book in whole. This left me missing details and there didn't seem to be a smooth transition between stories. I enjoyed hearing about Mack and the boys and their adventures, but at other points Steinbeck seemed to introduce characters that don't play any part in the story. The look at the blue collar life and discussion of what type of work makes one happy did interest me as I am going through a career crisis."
3,Cannery Row Review,"My personal opinion of the book Cannery Row is that it was a good book. I think that it shows the hardships for people after the great depression quite well. I also felt that the characters were described in a way that seems almost as if you have known them. This book is full of ups and downs, but I never lost interest. This book also shows the good in people who may appear as bad people. This is why I gave this book a 3, it is not great but it isn't horrible."
3,"Book was disjointed, with one good example of such.","Steinbeck had a wonderful ability to describe, but describing isn't enough unless one has something to describe that directs the story. Story? What story? Few of the ""chapters"" seemed to flow from or into the previous or following one. Example: what on earth was the point of the French physician embalming, and throwing away the liver ane entrails? Would someone fit that in for me?"
3,Cannery Row Review,"I red this book, Cannery Row, and would have to say this is a over all good book thats good for people that enjoy old time stories and whatnot. The reason I rated this a 3 is because some parts of the book dont keep my interest, but then again that comes with all books."
3,The book I love Cannery Row By Steinbeck.,"Cannery Row is just a few blocks long. Within its limits are sardine fisheries which give the Row its name. The story that builds up around this area and the memorable characters who inbabit it is suffused with warmth,understanding,and a great grasp of human values."
3,A Disjointed Effort With A Great Setting,"There are so memorable characters, but overall this feels like a very disjointed book. An overall theme is lacking -- however, the setting is spot on and the dialogue is good -- and it fails to say something larger than itself."
4,The Humility of Being Human,"Cannery Row is a montage of different little stories that all take place within or in close proximity to Cannery Row in Monterey, CA. The characters are simple, and thats the point that Steinbeck is trying to make....that life can be simple and beautiful without the aid of greed, money, prestige, and other material things.The focus is on the main characters' intentions for one another, particularly 'Mack and the Boys' intentions for Doc. The entire point of the book is that humans should not get caught up in material goods so much that they forget who they really are.Overall, this was a pleasant, easy read that brightened my day. It was loosely dynamic, and just well, pleasant. I enjoyed it, so I recommend it, but it may not blow you away in any way."
3,Cannery Row,"This book was alright, but it didn't really appeal to me all that much. It talked about things that didn't interest me, it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't call it good either. There were however some things that could be thought of as lessons such as you shouldn't always do something to get something out of it for yourself, but to be nice or to help someone else by doing that. All in all the book was ok."
3,A joe thought,I really dont like reading at all and I enjoyed this book very much. I think it is great for in the classroom because it keeps even a teens interest because there is constantly something interesting goin on. This book keeps you wondering whats going to happen next to one of the characters. The Row gives you real people in real situations so it is more interesting for the reader...
4,Worth Reading,"When I first read this book, I did not hold it in very high regard. I only scratched the surface of this book. I looked only for plot and style. What I unrealizingly found was an intricate portrait of human interaction, of alienation. Every aspect of human life is represented in Cannery Row, but you have to look for it."
3,ORIGINAL LATIN JAZZ,"For the price the CD was okay. The only complaint I have is that a few of the songs I like sound like they were copied from a scratchy record, rather than getting a CLEAN copy to put onto this CD like the song CUBOP CITY. These tunes are pretty good especially ""TANGA"", and ""CON POCO COCO."""
2,Poor sound quality!,"Though the musica has mucho potencial'...la qualita de recording es terrible'! Save your money....or buy it from me for dirt cheap, mi amigo/a !"
3,Missing Tracks!!,"Good compilation however some great songs are missing especially ""Painted Desert"" which is my favorite. In my opinion, buy ""The Best Shots"" released earlier that contains better songs."
3,Heart & Soul,"Good information, should have included more information from that era. So many artist of note not mention, but there is information there that has not been mentioned elsewhere. Good starter."
4,Kiddie Meal Collectibles,"This is a very well written and informative book, the only problem was the fact that it didn't have enough pictures, preferably in color. I know that this can run into alot of extra expense but to a serious collector its a must and I personaly would pay more for a book if it was like this with good pictures to help with identification. Well done Mr. Sodaro I hope to see a new book in 2003."
4,A Great Read for Children of All Ages!,"My eyes lit up when i saw this book. I've been collecting these toys for years -- and never knew what they were worth. These days, when i go for fast food, i buy two toys, one for my son to play with and one for me to add to my collection. Now that I've got this useful guide, i can keep track of the value of my toys and keep an eye out for other great additions. My son, who is only seven, loves the photos and has already shown an interest in surpassing my own collection!"
4,Fits Polar Monitor; stretches out quickly,"It's great to find a size small elastic band for the Polar Heart Rate Monitor chest piece. Many retailers sell only the Medium, and tell the customer to adjust the band. This is not a solution, as the elastic band stretches out quickly. Swimming in a chlorinated pool speeds the breakdown of the elastic. I buy three at a time because each band lasts only a few months."
3,Good Idea,Smaller than I thought and one was without lines which is okay but that information would have been helpful.
4,Enjoyable mystery,"This was a wonderful story. I have not really listened to many audiobooks but I found myself just as immersed as I would have if I had been reading the book. The characters were fascinating, especially Father Quart. I am very much looking forward to other books (or audios) by Perez-Reverte!"
5,When it seems like a story you would have written...,"It seems like for all of my life, there has been a particular book that has influenced me and truly reflected who I was at the time. Beginning last year as I started college, and continuing this year as well, that book has been The Seville Communion. This story is enjoyable enough being read superficially, as a mystery novel. However, the struggles of the characters, particularly Father Quart and Macarena, are what bring me back to the book again and again. For anyone who has felt that they are ""bailing water out of the Lord's boat,"" completed acts of ""faith"" out of pride, and has recognized that they are indeed part of a dying world, this book is for you. We are not alone....and some of Don Priamo Ferro's solace goes out to us as well."
3,Some modern clergy and religious still believe in God!,"While I found this book mildly entertaining, I was disappointed by the portrayal of the several characters who were clergy and religious. The author makes a great deal of the existential angst of such people, but each of these characters seems to find the meaning of their vocation without reference to God. The author seems to assume that no thinking person in the late 20th century could possibly have a real belief in God or Christ, and that the clergy is merely acting out a game for the benefit of those deluded laity who still believe. While there may be some such clergy and religious out there, surely there are many who do have an active and vital faith in God and Christ. I wish the author could at least have included one such for balance, as his portrayal just did not ring true for me."
2,A o.k read but not a suspense or mystery,"I read this with great anticipation and was let down. The characters are trite, a little sterotypical and the interaction between the two main characters was laughable at times. This novel plods and moves but never really engrosses you. In fact you begin to forget the mystery."
4,Entertaining,"I really enjoyed this book. I was intrigued, first, by the premise - a hacker in the Vatican computer system, and a priest who goes to investigate. And while the book didn't always live up to its promise, and while it did sometimes lapse into the ""trash novel"" genre, I still thoroughly enjoyed the read. I enjoyed being transported to Seville, and I was half in love with Father Quart myself. I enjoyed Perez-Reverte's depiction of the characters - ok, they were a little overdone and more like caricatures, but they were vivid. I also thought the ending was well done; I appreciate that the author didn't tie everything up into a neat little ""happy ending"", which would have trivialized it."
4,A Real Pearl,"Perez-Reverte disappointed me in the nautical chart book. It was artsy--too many references to books and movies, as if his characters couldn't emerge out of their actions. That's not the case here. His priests are real. That's a lot tougher than creating real cops in this world. And so's his Vatican. Dibden's CABAL works the same vein, but the comparison is all in Perez-Reverte's favor. He's closer here to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP than to CABAL. Cather gets the 5th star; that's the only reason THE SEVILLE COMMUNION doesn't."
3,Church and Priest Bashing Wrapped in a Mystery Plot,"This novel is supposed to be about a mystery/suspense based on Vatican plots. But it turns out to be a story about priests bashing and meandering plots on the characters, especially the Father Quart character.Well, but it sums up human feelings... and the seven deadly sins. It happens evertyime to somebody somewhere, including priests. Some people might enjoy this book more than others. Being my third Perez-Reverte's book, I found that it was just OK. A three star read."
4,The Divine Is In The Details,"I've found in reading the works of Arturo Perez-Reverte that, often times, the characters that most resonate are the supporting ones. Such is the case with ""The Seville Communion."" Rather than recount the plot of the book, which is never the key to enjoying his works, I will simply alert potential readers that Reverte's gift is in making one feel for those whom one might not ordinarily be predisposed; the saint is anything but, and the nominal villains, perhaps, display a greater depth of humanity than all. Sometimes the main points are the fine ones, and in this entertaining work, I believe that to be true."
3,Not as good as the rest of his books,"As much as I like other Reverte's books, I was tempted more than once to close this book without finishing it. Somehow I got to the page 160, and then all Reverte's magic was back, and I was glad that I did not put the book down. The main drawback for me was that the plot was relatively easy predictable, as compared to the other novels of Arturo Perez-Reverte. Also, my timing was not so good - after all Dan Brown buzz any book that begins in Vatican gets from me an immediate ""not again"" response. Anyway, Reverte's ability to weave together history, romance, philosophy and suspense still creates magic, despite not-so-fascinating plot and one-dimensional characters. And... now I'd really like to visit Ceville."
3,The Vatican's 007 Plods Along,"This, the third of Pérez-Reverte ""literate thrillers"" to be published in the US, is somehow less satisfying than the previous two (The Flanders Panel and The Club Dumas). Perhaps it because of the predominance of religious themes, or maybe the relative lack of action, I'm not sure. The story kicks off with a hacker breaking into the Pope's PC and leaving a plea to investigate the nefarious attempts to close down a small church in Seville. The Vatican sends one of its ""agents,"" who, like 007 is sharp dresser, good in a fight, and is a lady-killer. He, and all the characters are intriguing and well-developed, as is usual for Pérez-Reverte. Somehow, despite a clicking clock, the whole thing seems to sort of plod along without too much pace to it."
4,Interesting delineation of characters and plot,"The novel was intellectual with a surprising plot and typical Spanish locals as characters. As a teacher of Spanish literature, I found echos of Unamuno's San Manuel Bueno resonating in the faith vs. reason conflicts with which Father Quart was wrestling. Pérez Reverte transported me to Sevilla as he unfolded the plot. I would have liked more emotional depth and interaction; the story was like a fresh breeze that fans you pleasantly and then is gone. However, I did not guess the perpetrator of the entry into the Pope's computer and the revelation of the identity of the hacker delighted me and inspired me as I face inventing a new life for myself after I retire. Pérez Reverte drew the elder señora with a respect and enthusiasm that is typical in Spain and should be emulated in our country. While not deep, ""The Seville Communion"" is a delightful summer diversion."
3,Lack of Development,"This was a very mediocre book written by an author who has gripped me in other books with well written characters. The plot is very slow to develop, which can be fine when developing characters, but it seemed to turn me off rather than wrap me in them. I was still able to soak up a feel for the surroundings and history that I enjoy so much out of Mr. Perez-Reverte's novels, but I was somewhat disappointed that I didn't develop a feel for the characters that I'm used to. It almost seemed like the author didn't have a full idea of what he was going to do with certain characters before completion. I probably wouldn't recommend this novel; certainly not before The Flanders Panel or The Fencing Master."
4,Charm but radically impausible,"Perez-Reverte clearly loves Seville, and I now want to visit it. The characters I would most like to meet from the novel are the ""Three Stooges"" villains. The major protagonists less so, though it would be interesting to see Macarena remove her cigarette lighter from her bra strap (something the author brings up over and over). At some points plausibility plunges out of sight but then an episode of humor (particularly some muddled literary allusions by one of the villains) redeems things. Speeches by high clerics in the Vatican are wooden and unconvincing."
3,"Interesting, but not fully realized","Well, this is a middle-of-the-road review. The story gets off to a good start - interesting mystery, exotic Seville, and some interesting characters. Perez is a good writer but at about the middle of the book I began to feel that it was stuck in Park - not going anywhere. I persevered though because the author did make me care enough to find out ""who dunnit."" Unfortunately, I did not find the story's culprit to be credible. I don't think Perez-Reverte knows as much about the world of hackers as he purports to know. I do think he is an interesting enough writer that I would read another one of his books and hope for a more well-paced plot."
1,"cliche ridden, weak characters, simple plot, awful!",I was looking forward to an intelligently written novel What a disappointment this book was. I couldn't believe that anyone enjoyed this weakly written novel. It reqired no thought and in fact I was annoyed by all the cliches. The first rule of writting was ignored by this author.I can't finish his book because I am bored by his poor writing skills.
3,Deceived by Other Reviewers' Raves,"It took me several weeks to wend my way through this mystery novel, a genre which I admittedly seldom read. The four- and five-star reviews here fooled me, as I did not find the story, the setting, or the characters all that engrossing. There was a great deal of Catholic jargon to wade through, and I never got a feeling for any of the characters as being other than caricatures. I would not buy any of the other books by this author."
3,Not a mystery book,"I bought the book because I enjoyed Flanders Panel. But this book is not a mystery novel. The whole plot really revolves around the church (Our Lady of Tears) that is bound to be demolished but is being defended by the parish priest and a rich duchess who has some rights to the church property. The subplot is a hacker who got into the Vatican computer and left messages to the pope asking for help to preserve the said church. At the end, we finally found the hacker called Vespers but it is more of a confession rather than by detective work. There are some funny moments with three characters who are being paid to destroy the church."
2,The Plot is Wafer-Thin,"it is perhaps appropriate that the bulk of this novel takes place in a musty old Spanish church in the act of being restored, as the writing a plotting here are as musty as the material. It pains me to say this, as I loved Perez-Reverte's ""Flander's Panel"" and ""The Club Dumas"". But what those two books carried in flair and style, this one replaces with dull characters and a plodding pace."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book was highly recommended to me but turned out to be a major disappointment. The characters were one dimensional, the mystery was less than compelling and the writing was sub-par. The author kept interrupting the flow of the mystery with these supposedly humorous scenes with some bumbling co-consipirators. It wasn't funny, it wasn't mysterious, it was just bad."
1,Don't Bother,"I had really grown to enjoy Perez-Reverte's books after first reading some of his other stories such as the Fencing Master, the Flander's Panel, and the Queen of the South. I thought I'd gotten a good bargain by purchasing this book at $.45, but sometimes it's better to hang on to loose change. In this book, the plot was weak from beginning to end, and the climax was unrealistic, even with a stretch of the imagination. I was completely disinterested in the characters whom for the most part were unlikeable, anyway. On several occasions I thought about putting the book down, and had I not been spending a week on the beach with not much else to do, I probably would have. This book gave me the impression that the author was simply trying to fulfill his contract with the publisher to write a certain number of books, regardless of quality, before a certain date."
4,"Wonderful setting, charming book","Although The Seville Communion in some ways lacks the intellectual depth of The Flanders Panel, I found it to be an enjoyable read. After spending 6 months in the amazing town of Sevilla (two years ago), this book was an enchanting return to a marvellous town. The mystery itself was not too enthralling, nor was Father Quart as a main character. However, for me the book was a delightful diversion, and a welcome depiction of that charmingly quixotic city."
4,"Good characters, great blend of mystery and history!","I really enjoyed the book. The author did a great job of introducing the characters and describing the area where the action takes place. I especially enjoyed the mix of past and present, the 18th Century with the 20th soon to be 21st. Father Quart is the type of priest I would like to meet and have as a friend. I was kept quessing until the end for the identity of the killer, and was sorry to have the book end. I strongly recommended it to my friends and it is now making the rounds. I look forward to reading more of the authors books."
4,Moral crisis of the 20th century,"Yes, I deliberately am not emphasing the fact that the book is a mystery/thriller. What makes the book stand out is that it has several fully developed characters each in their own way attempting to deal with the end of an era - the decline of aristocracy, of faith, . . . Some of the incidental characters are flat - the complaint about the ""three stooges"" in a previous review was not unfair. I would rate The Class Trip or The Name of a Bullfighter as more successful as mystery/thrillers but would certainly add The Seville Connection to the list as well worth the time even if it doesn't keep one awake at night to finish it in a single reading."
5,great book!,"The main character of this book is a catholic priest/spy for the vatican. Set in Seville, he is to discover who is sending messages to the pope via the Web regarding a church to be demolished and some unfortunate characters caught in the middle of it. The plot is rich, the character development is excellent. This is one of the best books so far this year. I highly recommend it."
2,Whodunit? - Who Cares?,"Nothing irks the mystery reader more than noodling through a somewhat logically-derived story, only to be served a ridiculous ending like that offered by Reverte in The Seville Communion. Frankly (and I'm about to give the mystery away here, so be warned), the ending - the whodunit - made more sense before the last page, which served only to insult the reader. Yes, I know, the priest was playing the martyr. The point is, Vespers made more sense as Methusela than the young nun. I can't possibly be the only one who thinks this, am I? I concur heartily with other reviewers who found the writing tediuous, the characters linear and wholly noncompelling, and the plot/story absurd. In addition, I found Methusela to be a half-baked version of Walker Percy's Father Smith, though Reverte's Smith wasn't nearly as compelling or intelligent as Percy's. In my estimation, Reverte has yet to write anything quite worth investing time or money into reading."
2,I can only hope this book was better in the original Spanish,"I must have missed something that others got from this book. I found this book BORING! The characters, especially the comic relief trio, were incredibly inane. It was obvious who was the killer and the hacker about 25 pages into the book. I am sorry that I wasted electricity powering a light to read this book by. Upon finishing this book I quite cheerfully hurled it into the garbage."
2,Where's the beef?,"This is quite an enjoyable book, but it never gets into top gear. The pages turn over quite quickly, but neither the plot nor the characters are convincing or particularly interesting. There are too many characters and most of these are rendered purely for comic effect. The shabby villains are very reminiscent of the losers who perform similar functions in Graham Greene's early thrillers. They may work as amusing caricatures and one might argue that the book's collection of failed flamenco singers and useless ex-bullfighters is ironic - a mockery of other countries perceptions of Spain, but the book needs more than irony, jokes, lustful priests and glamorous aristocrats. Neither the Vatican nor the computer angles are rendered with much conviction and there are many long passages that add nothing to the slim plot or our understanding of the characters."
2,Half Baked at Best,"While I am a BIG fan of Perez-Reverte's work, The Seville Communion was a big let down. I have come to expect more from this literary master.I found the plot and the characters stilted and i could not even finish it. The plot could not hold my attention and I found myself more intruiged with doing the laundry than finding out who dunnit.I hope that Perez-Reverte's next book picks up the pace and is more akin to his first two books. My best advice for this book is don't bother."
4,Entertaining,"I found this book entertaining and as usual, full of detailed descriptions. I did like the book, even thought I may not share the portrait the author is writing about the Catholic Church. Not all Catholics are going through a crisis of faith! As for an earlier comment on the name of Macarena and the anoying song... I jut want to say that Macarena is a very common name in the South of Spain, specially in Sevilla."
4,If you enjoyed this book. . .,"I have to recommend to you another intriguing mystery with some very interesting contrasts to this novel: Glenn Kleier's, THE LAST DAY--the most powerful and thought-provoking suspense thriller I've ever read. I'd welcome hearing other reader's opinions of Kleier's novel, which you'll note from the voluminous reviews sent in by Amazon readers, is quite controversial. Hope you find it as much a page-turner as I did."
3,Mystery and mild philosophy set against a boring plot,"I read this book in a rather odd manner. I skipped most of the sections dealing with the shady business dealings of Macarena's husband and concentrated instead on the relationships between Father Quart, Macarena, the dead Carlotta, etc. The mystery was satisfying enough, and the passage in which the murderer was revealed was strikingly visual. If Mr. Macarena had anything to do with the mystery, I didn't miss it. For this reason I had to give the book just 3 stars.I found the comparisons between Reverte and Eco interesting. On my last trip to the bookstore I picked up the Club Dumas and the Name of the Rose b/c I found the blurbs on the back of the books to be similar in tone (this was prior to reading these reviews). I'm half way through the Name of the Rose, but I don't find any similarities in style, just perhaps in themes."
3,Not as good as the other two,"Father Quart is memorable, and the book is decent, but a disappointment after the Flanders Panel and the Club Dumas"
4,"A great read, although not very practical","This book has beautiful artwork both inside and out. What I liked the most were the different prayers and rituals that are described in rich detail. I found that if you do not have direct knowledge of herbs and how to identify and obtain them, that this book will not be of much use to you."
2,TOO VAGUE,"I found this book to lack depth and explanation. It vaguely lists certain herbs and plants that are of a healing nature, but the true content I was looking for was not here. I wanted more in-depth remedies for particular ailments, where this book applies certain remedies to a very hazy and small range of problems. I was also looking for a guide to ritualistic traditions rather than unmeasurable herbal concoctions."
3,Disappotinted in this little engine...,"I appreciate the previous reviews, however, we were very unsatisfied with this engine. It takes just one AAA battery, which unfortunately does not give it very much power. It was unable to pull even one car up our viaduct bridge. Also, we got it for our 2 year old. Because you cannot free wheel (meaning that you can only play with it when the battery makes it move- your child is not able to move the train himself), my son was always jamming the gears. We ended up going to the store and purchasing the Thomas engines- much more durable and they run on AA batteries for more power.I would like to say, however, that Brio products are the best. All of our tracks and accessories are Brio, and the company will take any of their products back with no questions asked (which is what we did)."
3,"concept is neat, but the engine is not powerful","This will work by itself, on a simple flat layout, but does not climb uphill and the engine cannot pull many cars. The Thomas ones are more powerful, but the most fun are the Brio Mighty Red, and Big Green engines which have lights, sounds, and reverse buttons, that are easy for an 18 mo old and up to operate. For slightly older children, the remote control train is awesome. Most of these have trouble climbing up the new Thomas Road/Rail track, though older clickety clack or Brio are fine. so if you are planning on beginning an extended collection of trains and accesories, pass on this engine, since its play value is not lasting."
2,Not fir the professional...,Spend the extra money and get a Marathon or Odyssey case. This one is ok but the screws are self tapping and tap into plastic. No metal rack mounts on this unit. The cover isn't very good as well...
2,NOT MADE FOR THE REAL MOBILE DJ,IT DOESENT HAVE A HOLE IN THE BACK FOR THE CABLES THATS THE DOWN SIDE THATS IT U HAVE TO MAKE A HOLE AND THE AMP DIDNOT FIT HAD TO CUSTOM FIT CUTS IN FOR THE SPEAKER CABLES
4,Nice case just a few issues....,Got the case with no other packaging besides the product box. Like other reviews said the amp doesn't fit in very easy. But other then that its very nice.
4,nice light rack...,"its molded plastic but that makes it light... i holds my mixer, crossover and power strip.one word of caution, my amp barely fit and i couldnt get my speakon connectors to go on when it was in..."
3,"very nice, but a little standard","i would have to say that only about 25% of the images in this book really stand out. the other 75% remind me of anything a person could shoot with any camera. other than that the photographers chose nice looking models and photographed them well. a good coffee table book, but lacks everywhere else."
1,weakest of the series....,"I have liked all of this series, but this one is the weakest- seems to be a lot of duplications of recipe types (ie 3 or 4 simillar fish recipes..). I still like the resturant overviews and layout tho. This one just seemed stale..(the Southern book is TERRIFIC.)"
5,Get This One,"When it comes to Charlie Haden & Quartet West, this is the one album to get. It seemlessly integrates the achingly beautiful vocal cuts from Jo Stafford, Jeri Southern, & Billie Holiday with the Quartet's own lyrical contributions. If you're looking for a jazz recording that's ""smooth"" without being boring, evocative, & melodically marvelous, get this one. And then track down vocal recordings by Jo Stafford, who sings ""Haunted Heart"" on this CD and was probably the greatest female American ""pop"" singer ever."
5,The 1 CD I'd take to a tropical isle,"This is among my favorite of all CDs I've listened to. The instrumentals are beautiful and run the spectrum of many different moods but all evocative of 1940s movies and Hollywood itself. Rather than being distracting , the vocal pieces are at first jarring but then you sense how they fit into the bigger piece and add a reality and history to the one being recreated by this great group of musicians."
3,Alan Broadbent and Ernie Watts are good.,His music is the good music which reminds the old good United States.
1,its great... when it works,"every other time I try to use this headset, it becomes possessed. It won't turn off, it won't respond to anything, and it won't connect to anything... it's a real pain and there's no way to reset the thing. I have to wait for the battery to run out when it's on standby which takes days."
2,Dry Adaptation,"While there exists little in Chinese history that is not thoroughly fascinating, Sterling Seagrave manages to tirelessly and in great detail, unsubstantiate every myth surrounding the last empress of China. She no longer maintains any sort of mystique, as it has been entirely laid bare by someone who is too intent on debunking the half-truths presented by the Europeans. Previous reviews that state that the book lacks of biographical element have it right, with as much pomp and circumstance as possible, the author seeks to prove his postion as a self-proclaimed ""expert"" rather than relaying the story of what could have been a truly fascinating woman."
2,the wicked woman as the last empress who caused a bancruptcy,"she was a great evil woman that had appeared in the last Qing Dynasty.For instance: Like she still had done and used a ""Death by a thousand cuts"" for all prisoners for 120 years ago, China is one of the highest cultures and oldest civilizations in the world, but the chinese acted like the Barbarians. China is becoming a top record of human right violation until today.Iam happy cause I was born in Bali not in China."
3,Glimpses of Tzu-Hsi,"This book is less a biogrogaphy of ""the dragon empress"" Tzu-Hsi of China than a revison of 19th century Chinese history.This work is important because the author has rechecked the validity of the usual sources on 19th cent history and found them very wanting - and very biased to boot. It shows the worth of double checking your sources when doing research and questioning 'experts'. Mind you, this could also apply to this book to some extent as it could have been improved with more chinese sources.Where this book fails is as a biography of Tzu-Hsi, she only takes up a small section of the book, the rest is all explanation of various plots and ""foreign devil"" attrocities in china. Nobody comes out of it well.For an interesting (and probably mostly correct) overview of 19th century China this book is invaluable - as a biography of Tzu-Hsi it does not accomplish a great deal and you feel you know very little about the subject at the end of the book."
4,Good Coffee,"Good coffee for the price. It's much the same as Douwe Egberts at a lower cost. These same coffee pods sell for half the price in Europe, but then again, the U.S. dollar isn't worth much anymore!"
3,Not equal to Senseo Coffee by any measure...,"I had high hopes for the Gala Brand, however now after trying the Dark Roast and the Mocha I find both to be just average coffee and no competition for the Senseo or even the Archer Farms which I find the best for the Senseo Machine.The coffee is a bit burnt in the roast and brews up weak in comparison to the other brands, do not try to get 12oz from any of these pods, the liquid will run clear after 6oz per pod.Price is great if you like weak coffee or using twice the pods for your travel mug in the morning...As the old adage goes, you get what you pay for, and even though from Holland these are not re-packaged Senseo pods as some lead to believe!"
1,Heart of a Jaguar review.,"It gives you a reason to be scared. This book will make you cry, frightened and most importantly, grossed out. Why would you be grossed out to the point were you must make your latest meal come out of you oral cavity, you ask? If you must know, guts and gore and so much more are what make this book gruesome.Drought, dryness, heat, no food, no water, how would you like to live under these circumstances? Why would you want to even read about those conditions, I know I wouldn't? Besides the fact that there are guts and gore there are dead animals, sacrifice, and the most gruesome things ever. Why would you want to read this book?"
1,Boring like all get out.,"Heart of a jaguar by Marc Talbert was heart-stopping, as in animals? (and humans?) hearts were prematurely stopped. This book was about a Mayan boy named Balam. Balam was fourteen years old in the middle of a draught in the year 1200 or so, and the whole novel is about his village trying to please the gods so they would send rain. There is a lot of bloodletting and fear of forest spirits who will try to capture you and haul you off to eat you. In the end Balam?s wife to be gets snitched away by people from another village and in an attempt to exact revenge Balam kills a jaguar, which makes him superior to everyone else, so his village sacrifices him. The end.I did not like this book because it was pretty boring and didn?t really have a plot. It was also way too bloody to be in any way likable."
4,Very Gruesome!,"a drought has plagued Balam's Mayan city- in an attempt to save his people, Balam sacrifices a jaguar to please the gods. But it is not enough; will Balam make an extreme sacrifice? This was an interesting book. It had some nasty things in it. There are some adult jokes in it that some kids won't understand. A bit too gruesome to be a children's book."
3,Heart of a Jaguar - cool or fool?,"The book Heart of a Jaguar was remarkable, chilling, and fascinating. It really teaches a lot about the Mayas, while giving you a compelling read. It has a surprise ending, (...). Although the book is an excellent read, it also makes you cry and have a reason to be scared. Also, if you haven’t read anything about the Mayas, you may be very grossed out.This book contains many of the rituals the Mayas did, and it really makes you feel like you’re right there. If you wish for a nice, sweet novel for reading all curled up in your bed, this is not your book. If you wish for a story that will make you cry for your mommy, and have nightmares if you read it at night, this is the book for you!"
3,Heart of a Jaguar Satisfying but Lacking,"The book Heart of a Jaguar was a unique book, but it left something to be desired. The author did a good job of getting the ideas and feelings across, but his method could be thought of as slightly disturbing by some readers. There is a fair amount of violence but like it or not, it is needed to make the book work smoothly.Also, the author leaves the main issue in the book unsolved with the ending. The plot was fairly predictable, but the ending was not really a satisfactory conclusion because the books main problem wasn't really answered. It was a decent book, but if there were an epilogue to just say what happened it would have been a lot better and also if the plot weren't as predictable."
3,Heart of a jaguar,"Overall I enjoyed the book Heart of a Jaguar. There were several things that could be changed, but overall it was good. It was very vivid and descriptive and almost too descriptive in several parts. I didn't enjoy the violence in the book but there wasn't very much of it.The only thing I despise about the book was the ending, I don't care that the main character dies, but I want to know what happens to the rest of the village. I knew that Balam was going to die from the beginning because my brother read Heart of a Jaguar last year and told me that Balam was sacrificed in the end."
2,Heart of a Jaguar review,"I thought that the book was not the best I have EVER read, it was NOT a book I would recommend to people and that I would like to read again. I don't recommend it because it is VERY graphic in details about sacraficing. The ending was my favorite part was the ending. If you want to know something about the Maya"
3,Heart of a Jaguar,"The Heart of the Jaguar was a very graphic novel with many gruesome and sometimes racy parts. Otherwise it was very realistic and gave you and omnipresent view of what it was really like in the Mayan culture. I like the plot a lot, and it hooked me and kept me wanting to read it more and more. The story was somewhat sad, when people were killed and or just died. I enjoyed this book."
1,A Book with Some Gorey Details,"Heart of a Jaguar book had an O.K. plot, and there were some good parts. However, the gorey parts made the whole book unenjoyable for me. Since many of them are not appropriate to discuss on the internet, I will not give examples - but they were disgusting. Occasionally the characters did inappropriate things, or used profane language. I know this was how people acted in Mayan days, but the discription of some things was a little bit much. So if you love reading about bloody and gorey things, you would enjoy this book."
2,Too Gruesome,"This book was an... interesting view into a proposed Mayan village, and the author used too many gross parts and too many adult analogies, as this is classified as a ""children's book."" This book may be historically correct, but it should NOT be classified for children."
2,"Gory, and not the best book either","Heart of a Jaguar is about Balam, a Mayan boy. His village is experiencing a severe drought. They give a lot of blood to the gods, but it still doesn't rain! In the process of giving blood, there are some very disgusting parts. Meanwhile, strange things happen to Balam. A fish from Xibalba (the underworld) appears, and he meets his dead twin brother and mother. Eventually, they decide someone must be sacrificed. I didn't really like this story because some parts were disgusting, and I didn't like the plot either."
2,Weak Plot Hurts Mayan Novel,"Heart of a Jaguar is well written with reasonably good descriptions, but does not have a good plot. On the back of the book, it talks about how the city is having a bad drought and they try sacrificing a dog, but it doesn't bring rain, and will they ask Balam to make the greatest sacrifice of all? When I read this it told me exactly what would happen in the end, but I won't give it away. None of the stuff on the back of the book happened until some time near the end. Random events occured up to the ceremony that weren't that important to the story. This book is accurate with what the Mayan culture was like, but has a very bad plot. Also, this book gets very descriptive with the bloody descriptions when it is not incredibly important. Overall, I didn't really like this book"
2,Heart of a Jaguar,"I think that this book is an ok book. The author describes the characters and scene well. He uses vivid words to describe the setting. He created a good plot and you could never set the book down. The characters are very adventurous. All the characters have their own personality with different characteristics.There are scenes in which you feel like you are really there. He makes the violent parts dramatic and scary. The author can get carried away at parts but he keeps you hooked through the whole book. You could almost cry at the end. He makes you terrified at violent parts, like you are watching everything happen. There are also some gross parts, when you wish you never read."
2,YAYA,The Heart of a Jaguar was a pretty o.k. novel with inaproprite parts. It tells all out about the Mayan civilization.
1,Heart of a Jaguar review by a Rapine expert,The book heart of a Jaguar is really weird. It's about a boy named Balam; he lives in a villiage near Chichen Itza. There was a terriable drought. The people in Balam's villiage has to please the god with sacrifices inorder to get rain.It has a lot of violence thorough out the book.
2,EAGLE school review (a student),"Heart of a Jaguar was a fun book to read, but I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who doesn't like violence. This book is not gory except for a few scenes which are really bloody. I gave this book 2 stars (I would have given it 2.5, but I can't) because I am not a gory and bloody person. The book is a good read (about 210 pages). I liked most of the book, but some was not my favorite(the bloody parts).Heart of a Jaguar is about a boy who lives in a village around the time of the Maya. His village is near Chichen Itza. The main problem in the book is the village is having a drout. The village needs water to grow maize and the gods won't provide rain. They do may rituals and sacrifices but it isn't enough. Balam kills a Jaguar but it may not be enough. Will the Jaguar bring rain and what will happen to Balam? Read Heart of a Jaguar to find out."
2,an ok story but sort of disgusting,"In this book, there is a drought in Balam's village. It tells about Balam's life in the Yucatan, and their strugle to bring the rains. Balam is eager to become a man, and he kills a jaguar, thinking that this will please the gods and bring the rains. However, it does not.This book depicted a lot of violence, blood and gore, and had a sad ending. I would not recommend it to people who don't handle blood well."
3,Heart Of A Jaguar,"This book was a well written for young people who are in 5th or 6th grade. The author, Marc Talbert, clearly wrote how it would be like in the daily life of a Mayan person. Although the book was a little bit bloody, it portrayed how it is in real life, as though you were actually ripping the heart out of a jaguar. The story was very sad and sometimes heartbreaking, but it showed what would happen if you were a Mayan."
3,Heart of a Jaguar rewiem,"I really like this book. Marc Talbert, the author, does a good job describing the characters and the setting. I really like how the characters are in this book, for example, the main character Balam a boy going to man hood wants to please the gods.If you would like to read about the Mayas, Heart of a Jaguar would be a good book for you. I would also recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure. This book has some violence, which is scary; because of the sacrifices people do in this book."
3,The Heart of a Jaguar,I think that the Heart of a jaguar is a good book. The author depicts the life style of the Mayan's very well. He uses very vivid words to create the setting were Balam lived. In this book there are some violent parts but they are there for a good purpose. In this book you will see how a Mayan boy Balam deals with everyday problems and obsticals.The end is good. You can also see how a young boy has to deal with a drought that has over come his village. Talbert says how he is sad about his brother and how he falls in love quite well. Also he says how there is a major problem in this book about his lover.All in all this is a very good book he depicts the problems and the obstacles very well. He also uses very vivid words so it is better to enjoy the book.
1,The CD does not work well ;it is garbage,"this was a trick the CD does not work well, there is a scratch that made impossible to read the CD.I am a regular buyer and this is the first time that something like this happend, bad , I am Unhappy"
4,Little Tikes Town & Train Table Playset,"I really wanted to know the dimensions before I decided on this table, but I went ahead and ordered it to find out. For others who are interested in this table they are 54x33x17. It is not as tall as the other table I was also looking at but I decided to keep it anyway. I was concerned it would not be sturdy enough since it didn't have a shelf underneath. It is very sturdy and heavy! I like that the table surface is solid green so my son can play different things on the table. The storage box is large and nice. It holds a lot, fits under the table, and can be used as a seat. The reason I didn't give this produce 5 stars is because the directions for the table, box, and train set were not very clear. However, after we figured them all out we were very satisfied with the product."
4,"Wow, these are quite...cedar-y!","Excellent shoe trees made almost completely out of incredibly aromatic heartwood. I've had a few sets of Woodlore trees before and have always been blown away by how aromatic they are compared to other companies. The reason it doesn't get five stars is that although they are expanding, there is a possible better choice out there. If you have a shoe size that fits the Woodlore/AE full toe shoe trees, those really do fill out the shoe much better.Still, these are excellent trees, and will definitely increase the life of your shoes!"
3,Their O.K.,"I have the woodlore full tree as it is called. These are floppy , the front is split. On the full, the front is solid with two slots and they just seem to be better made."
1,locking cap?,seemed like a nice heavy steel cap and would have worked great if they would have sent the rite keys for it! keys have serial number on them and cap has serial number on it they did not match! next time i will go to a store and buy it to make sure they keys are the rite ones!!!
1,HOW DO I RETURN THIS PURCHASE,HOW DO I RETURN THIS PURCHASE ?I ORDERED THIS AS INSTRUCTED AND THEY DONT FITAND THEY DONT SEND YOU ANY INFORMATION ON HOW RETURNIF THEY IS A PROBLEM
5,GREAT MEDITATION BOOK,"This is a great book to get the know the ""stories"" of the bible. I use it to teach kids. I also like to read it as a devotional sometimes. BUY THIS BOOK! You will find yourself taking it off the shelf often and cherishing every moment you spend with it. It will also enrich your understanding of the Bible."
3,Content good - structure not,"Spurgeon's sermons are ageless, good and to the point. He is not an ear tickler like so many who call themselves pastors today. He speaks the truth in love and he does not shrink back from calling sin, sin and those who do not repent, hell-bent sinners; yet he always points to hope and salvation at the Cross of Jesus. Why then 3 stars? This kindle version is full of grammatical and spelling errors, such as ""I"" is frequently represented as ""!"". Another example is a sentence in the third sermon: ""down is our place, fiat before the cross."" It should read ""flat before the cross."" On top of that, it appears that the sermons are not complete and that some parts have been left out. I discovered this when I looked for the audio version or a text version I could forward to others. I hope these mistakes are fixed soon."
3,Very strange movie,"Weird, to say the least. Jack Nicholson is a cattle rustler who feels his days will be numbered if he continues in that profession, so he quits and takes up farming. His gang, however, keeps up the rustling, and Marlon Brando, a gunslinger, is brought in to put a stop to it. Brando acts like he just escaped from a nuthouse, goes to wearing dresss and taking bubble baths as ways to get his men. The story makes little sense and has no focus, but Nicholson and Brando are interesting as they try to out act and out mug each other."
1,"Yes, this movie is broken.","Yes, this movie is broken. It`s boring, dragging and sleep inducing.The acting is bland. The dialogues are insipid. The pace drags and drags. I agreed with reviewer, Steven Kuroiwa, when he said this was the worst movie of Marlon Brando. I`m glad I did not rent it. I borrowed it from the library instead."
2,Foul Mouthed Western,"I don't know who gave this movie a PG rating, but they sure missed the mark. In short, if you do not like taking the Lord's name in vain, and coarse language in general, don't waste your time on this movie. It, also, is nothing like the old Westerns where the good guy was good and the bad guy was bad. In this movie, it seems that every one is bad, or willing to ignore morality when it would seem to benefit them at the moment. So much for honesty, character, valor, chivalry or any other virtues; they don't seem to be of concern in this movie."
1,Maybe I should have watched the Juiceman infomercial instead,"I watched this movie a few days ago at a time of night when infomercials are most prevalent. I began watching the film with no real expectations, but still happy that I might have stumbled upon some cinematic gem at 2 or 3 in the morning. But as the movie progressed I could only justify my further viewing of it as the choosing of a lesser ""evil"". Sadly, this movie joins a long list of other films where a cornucopia of talent was assembled, but the result was.... So many of the actors in this film are wasted on the material given them, and the only perfomance that really makes an impact (Brando's) is simply laughable. One can catch a glimpse of the sad state Brando's career will ultimately reach while watching this film. I'm not even going to get started on the dull, meandering plot. Basically, just don't watch this movie, at least if there's something else better on...like a Juiceman infomercial."
4,A near-masterpiece,"Although definitely quirky in spots, this Western has the ""ring of truth"" as it portrays much more realistically than most Westerns life as it really was at the time and place depicted. No heroes, but real people. I like John Wayne as much as the next guy, but most of his roles were a bit cartoonish compared to the more fully realized characters in this flick. I'll put this movie up there with ""True Grit"" (both versions/visions), ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""All the Pretty Horses"", ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""The Shootist"" as among the best of the best Westerns. If there were 4.5 stars, I would give it that. This movie is to Westerns what Deer Hunter is to Vietnam films."
1,"Love the movie, but hated the DVD","I love this movie and I wanted to loan it to a friend to enjoy, but it would'nt play on my DVD or theirs. Had to send it back. :-("
4,"A ""weird brando"" movie","Brando is at his best in Missouri Breaks. It's one of the roles that gave him his reputation for being an eccentric. He goes from accent to accent without any direction. He is so fun in this movie. Acting just plain ""Weird"". He did the same thing in ""One Eyed Jacks"" which you should definetely get if you liked ""The Missouri Breaks"". Brando had a reputation for being strange and acting on a whole different level. You can see it in this movie. The movie is so-so. The Brando performance is just something to watch and marvel at. He was on the edge, doing his own thing. Nicolson is admirable playing the straight man against the whacked out Brando character who is kind of a cowboy homosexual killer type. It's really worth a look. Enjoy. Grandma's tired now. Bye."
3,Very interesting play between Brando & Nicholson.,"Brando & Nicholson give interesting performances. Plot is a little weak, but it isn't boring and it certainly isn't the worst film ever made as one critic would have you believe. In my opinion it's one of the better western movies made and well worth seeing."
4,Brando Redux,"Can't quite agree with the fulsome accolade accorded this strange film by your Texas correspondent, but it is a striking piece of work and it has been badly served by Maltin's uncomprehending review. Any movie featuring Marlon Brando in a Mother Hubbard mouthing Irish gibberish and nailing Harry Dean Stanton with a throwing star can't be all bad. (Tom McGuane, author of the elegant script, tells a wonderful story about asking Brando, who was evidentally a bit bored with the proceedings, how he'd have his character kill one of the rustlers. ""Well,"" Marlon reportedly responded, ""first I'd fill his mouth with bees."""
3,Missouri Breaks a good Western,"I watched this for my film class, and I can see why my teacher picked it. Jack Nichelson and Marlon Brando are great! I wish they would've interacted more. The story dragged for me in some places. Also, the sudden changes in tone from dumb, silly slapstick humor, to depressing and serious seemed odd to me. As far as western movies go, it may not be the best, but it's worth seeing."
1,European DVD's,The movie is a good one and the product was clean and on time------------------- Only ------------- movies from Europe will not work on American Equipment. They tried to blame me for not noticeing that it was from overseas ---- IF IT WON'T PLAY IN AMERICA --- DON'T SELL IT IN AMERICA!!!!!!
5,Classic artistry,"Oh Tennessee Williams....you were a master of storytelling. I purchased this for an audition of ""Streetcar"" and fell in love again with the characters and story line. Doesn't hurt that a young, shirtless Marlon Brando was on the cover to reference back to throughout the play."
5,A classic play!,"This story is great and moving. I recommend it as a must for readers. It's a time piece from post WWII America and deals with deterioration of a southern belle, primitive male dominance, love, and realism vs idealistic fabrication. This version is great and close to original."
2,Sick! Sick! Sick!,"""STELLA!"" This was probably the most memorable line of this movie which was not, to state it diplomatically, one of Tennessee Williams' best works. Marlon Brando was at his worst in acting, as was the case with Vivian Leigh. The French Quarter of New Orleans never looked worse, and the story-about a school teacher who had an illicit affair with one of her students- was also sick. I saw it once and regretted having done so. For many reasons it's far from being recommendable."
3,One sister's complicated involvement in her sister's family.,I thought that the story was fairly decent with good characterconflict and power struggle among Stanley and Blanche. With a mindboggling explosive ending that leaves the reader guessing.
3,"Classic play, be careful when ordering.","Although I don't love this play everybody seems to know it so it's probablly a good idea to have read it at one point or another. HOWEVER, there are many many different versions of this play, and the version I ordered was not the most recent. Make sure everybody you are reading/performing the play with is using the same version."
5,A Piece of America,"Tennessee Williams' Pulitzer Prize winning masterpiece has been the source of controversy since it was written five decades ago. It is the story of the fallen Southern belle Blance Dubois, whose desperate illusions of grandeur are rent to shreds by her earthy and realistic brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski. Touching on issues of prejudice, sexual codependence, mental breakdown, and rape, A Streetcar Named Desire is at times disturbing in its brutal honesty. Readings of this sultry play have found it to be anything from a critique of the conflict between the North and South in post Civil War America, to a subtle commentary on the struggles of Williams' life as a homosexual. The image of Stanley bellowing drunkenly to his wife Stella, as well as lines such as Blanche telling how she has ""always depended on the kindness of strangers"" have become so much a part of the American consciousness that they are recognizable even to those who are unfamiliar with Williams' work itself."
2,no good choice,"The choice of copies of _The Streetcar Named Desire_(required reading for high school academic Englishthis summer) seemed to narrow down to ones withlurid covers or this plain one. Unfortunately, the textis almost like a typewritten script--small print anda little hard to read."
2,I had to read it twice,"Williams describes in the play different characters and the life of those three characters. There is Blanche, a sentimental woman who is afraid of the light and on the other hand there is Stanley, Stella's husband who is a rude man and likes gambling and drinking. Between these two characters is Stella Blanche's younger sister who really loves her husband and who does everything for him and couldn't live without him. I think it's difficult to get these three characters together for a play with a lot of tension as Williams did. When I read the end for the first time I was a bit surprised because it sounded really brutal. But now I have read it again and I think it's the best thing for Blanche to live in this mental hospital because there she can live her own life."
2,A Streetcar going nowhere,Personally I only got this book because I needed it for an assignment. I don't know why teachers can't seem to update their literature cause this book was so boring I couldn't stand reading it. Why can't we read something like Harry Potter? Typically I enjoy reading books but this was just terrible.
3,Somebody help please me till sunday!,"I need a quite long essay about Blanche's character;how she is at the beginning,how she got crazier by time(the forces acting on her and how she responds),and finally the defeat and spiritual death of her.(By using examples) Please Heeelllppp! MY adress:fgokkurt@yahoo.com"
2,Dull....Very Dull!,"I choose this book because it seemed very interesting, also I had never read a play before. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone. There seems to be no plot and everyone acts encredibly dumb. I have to find three themes to this book and so far NONE!!!!"
1,A boring story in N.Orleans,"The most boring story I ever read, The story of a crazy woman his sex maniac sister and the ape of her husband. All is surrounded by the tipical sexim of William's plays. Don't waste your money"
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had to read this book for school. I do not recommend it to anyone. Boring, Boring, Boring, Boring. That sums it up. Blanche is out of her mind. Stanley is just mean and cold. Stella doesn't see the true colors of Stanley or Blanche. Boring, Boring, Boring, Boring"
4,Williams Paints An Accurate Picture of the South,"This is a play written by the Southern genius, Tennesee Williams. It is a tradegy about the life of a woman named Blanche, the main character. She has come to live with her sister, Stella, in order escape her past life. In the play Williams shows how women were dependent on men after the Second World War. Women viewed men as money makers and a way to assure their future security. Also the play is quick paced with moving conversations. Also the setting shows how Louisana was a very diverse place filled with many different ethnic groups. With this play, Tennesee shows how southern life was during the 1940's."
3,Interesting,"I liked the read but I don't see why this work has the acclaim that it does. I must have missed something.I thought the play was entertaining in a dark, depressing manner. But the message of hopelessness that I got from the work was just pitiful. The only characters to be admired in the play were weak victims. The strong are happy and the good are fools. I suppose many that love the work feel a sense of helplessness and hopelessness and find a sort of validation in it.I would not recommend this book for its message but for entertainment there are worse reads out there."
4,A fine book with interesting concepts,"I read this book recently with my class group and we had great fun reading it.The obvious comparisons and great differences between the characters make the book interesting.Stanley's rawness and agressiveness gives me the impression of a true character,and his sweet,loving wife Stella,who is obviously much in love.But for me Blanche was the star, in the movie as well as in the play.Her character is complex and intriguing providing a fabulous role and great fun for an actress. Thumbs up,for Tenesse Williams!!!p.s.We enjoy it so much we are actually doing scenes of the play....."
5,Why did I wait to read this?,"I read Master and Commander some time ago but resolved to read the series. Once I picked up Post Captain I berated myself for the delay. What a great read. Besides the humor, the mesmerizing plot, and the excellent character development I was captivated by the insight into the British culture two-hundred years ago. Assuming that O'Brian has it right, it is amazing that one arm of the government labors to enforce the law and put Aubrey into prison while the Admiralty sends him out to enrich the King's coffers.Overall a truely great book -- with a great finish!"
5,"Adventure, romance, the sea, and capital comic wit combined!","What absolutely delicious reading this is! Master and Commander was excellent. This is even better. I cannot believe how very, very funny O'Brian can be!There is a little scene in the beginning of this book where he briefly describes Jack's horse, a ""sullen gray gelding"" who spends most of his time ""mourning his lost stones"", and the horse's train of thought, something like, ""Sits too far forward at a jump, I'll have him off sooner or later... Oh, a mare! A mare!"" I just laughed myself to tears.It is rare to find a book that has such a rich blend of various ingredients. O'Brian's insights into the wide variety of human personality (not to mention equine!), his quirky sense of humor, his excellent portrayal of the ways of life in that time, the politics, the navies, the ships, all are tied together, and blend beautifully into this absorbing human drama.I think I'll have to read them all!"
2,Post Captain Disappoints,"I am a great fan of the Aubrey-Maturin series, so I am loathe to write anything negative. However, I have struggled to finish ""Post Captain"". It is tedious reading, and dull for the most part. The book never really establishes a plot line. It shifts through a listless struggle between Aubrey and Maturin's romantic aspirations, and then back to Jack's dicey struggle with his chain of command. The book confuses and makes painful reading at times. It lacks the sublime feeling I had from reading other volumes in the series."
3,"Read ""Master and Commander"" first","The whole series is great, and this is a worthwhile chapter in the overall story, but it just wasn't that great a book on its own. I enjoyed the stories of Jack's attempts to evade the his creditors and was intrigued by his new ship (a former secret weapon). There's also a romance that is well-written by O'Brian. And the character of Stephen Maturin is well-developed.The downside is that the outcome of the secret weapon is predictable, and the romatic plot-line left me shaking my head at what a dolt Jack Aubrey can be. There's also a personal feud that starts promisingly enough and seems to just fizzle out; I hope future books develop it better.It's worth reading if you're already into the series, but I certainly wouldn't start with it."
2,"Disappointed with O'Brian's ""Post Captain""","I found Patrick O'Brian's ""Post Captain"" to be a plodding and literary ""dense"" read. I spent more time trying to decipher the archaic prose and search for sailing terminology definitions, then actually reading and enjoying the book. Also much of the ""action"" took place on land - another detraction from a high seas naval adventure. Much more readable and enjoyable are C.S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower novels that will transfer the reader to the age of ""wooden ships and iron men"" without the ponderous wording or having to master the British Seamanship Rules of Sailing Terminology.Glad I borrowed O'Brian from the local library... and was not out any money! Beat to quarters... but steer clear of this one!"
2,I hope the rest of the series is better...,"I was amazed by Master and Commander and resolved to read the entire series. But then I got to Post Captain, and it was like having a bad dream of an Aubrey-Maturin book. Crossing the whole country on foot disguised as a performing bear? Was I supposed to take this seriously?"
2,Not a Sailor,"I will continue to read the series, but I must say it could have been enhanced had there been some glossary of the nautical terms used so profusely. I would have expected nothing less mind you, but unlike having a good dictionary for other words, there were many terms to be found nowhere. It can make for some rugged reading.Still, the book is worth the effort. I am just not sure the full enjoyment is available to those who are not intimately familiar with sailing and with sailing a vessel during the Napoleonic era.And who am I to judge a book? Because I spent money to buy it."
5,Finishing the book really was like losing an old friend.,A terrific book in almost every way. There might be a time when the romantic antics of Aubrey and Maturin get in the way of the adventure spirit which is at the heart of this great series but no...the whole thing is handled with enigmatic skill by O'Brian. The final fifty pages are just masterly and the style in which Aubrey anticipates victory by laying out the best silver for dinner with the enemy captains is the very essence of 'cool'.
4,The second in the series.,I thoroughly enjoyed getting a deeper understanding of the main and supporting characters and brought to a fine climatic ending.
1,Far too blatant an ending,"To Mr. O'Brien:Damn you sir. A well-written book, but you leave the exploits of Aubery and Maturin, and the status of Mss. Sophie and Diana quite unresolved...a blatant call to purchase the next novel.I shall read no more of your scrivening, sir, Forester would not leave his readers hanging so. Your technical knowlege is not sufficient to save you. Were I a Gentleman, I should challenge you at the next opportunity. Enough!"
1,schizophrenic,This is one of the worse novels I have ever read - The writing is so broken apart it seems that pages must have been pulled out of the book. The author jumps forward and backward and into different scenes and times without any appropriate lead. This writing would have received a failing grade in most college level courses.
4,one of the most UNDERRATED metal bands of all time....,"This is pure gold for the cirith ungol fan - 2 (full) discs of unreleased versions/instrumentals/live tracks etc. from the archives - This is also NOT the place to start if your new to this band.Several of these tracks where nearly lost,and only survive on poor-quality elements.Fans will only be grateful that they survived at all!This is easily a ""five star"" for the fan.Anyway,what i'm trying to say is that this is a compilation of ""odds-n-ends""made for the fans and as such some of the material is a little ""weathered"" - If you are curious & want to check them out, find one of their studio releases first."
1,Cheesy and small..like bird brains.,"These chairs are a nice color, but that is about all. They are undersized for adults (about 3/4 of what they should be). The wood is very soft and light weight and does not look like it will last very long. Construction details are poor. Like the other reviewer, we would like to send them back (or someplace) but dont have the boxes. These are junk that Amazon shouldn't be selling."
2,Beware,"These chairs look good in the picture, but are very flimsy & cheap in person. We ordered 2 of them 3 weeks ago, and one is already falling apart. We would send them back, but we've already thrown out the boxes they came in. Save your money!"
5,GREAT SERVICE!,The book came VERY fast and was exactly as described. Very Happy and will do business again.
4,Cosco High Back Booster Car Seat,Purchased for a 5 year old grand daughter who was visiting. Worked fine in the backseat of my van for a three day road trip with grand-daughter and family. This way we didn't have to drag her own car seat on the plane from the west coast.
1,How is this safe?,"I bought this model from a store, but it was pink. I brought it home and had my daughter sit in it uninstalled. She is 3 1/2, weighs 34 lbs, and measures 31"" from shoulder to floor standing. ALthough very average in size, she was too tall for the harness (the strap came out a tad below) and too small to use the car's seat belt. I don't see how this seat is safe for the majority of toddlers. Are people moving to booster too quickly because of this product? They must be!"
2,Child Complainted of Bump Sticking Into Her Back,"I purchased this for my youngest granddaughter who outgrew the other seat I had. I wanted a five point unit that would work with just a seatbelt as I do not have shoulder straps in the back of the car. (I would have prefered the Fisher Price 20/60 five point unit but they stopped making it.)She fit in the seat with the straps in the upper slots. Unfortunately, there is a lump about an inch below the upper slots in the middle of the seat where one of the latching straps is attached to the rear of the seat. She felt this through a light winter coat. I had to put padding between the seat and the seat cover to prevent the bump from bothering her.If a child is smaller enough for you to use the lower strap holes they probably won't feel the lump as it will be between their shoulders and their neck. However, if they are large enough to require the use of the upper strap holes they will have the lump pressing against their spine."
4,Excellent car seat for the price,I was looking online to find a used car seat for our second car and found this new one for a similar price. It's a great seat and I found it as easy as any other to install.
1,Safety questionable,"I'm returning this car seat. After only using it twice, the belt clip pulled right out when I went to clip my child into the seat. I was disconcerted when it came out so easily and wondered how easily it might come out in an actual car accident. The manual tells you how to re-insert it, but the model I bought only has one slot for it, so there is no reason to make it easy to pull out (since it isn't adjustable with multiple slots for different sized kids). I'm not taking my chances on this seat..."
1,Don't buy!,"A family friend bought us this booster as a gift because it has all of the features that she knew we were looking for in a booster. However, it is very difficult to adjust and the way it sits in our vehicle causes my son's legs fall asleep every time he rides in it. The straps are dependent on each other, so as you try to loosen one side you have to tighten the other. It takes a lot of fussing around with to get the straps tightened securely. Our son is currently in an Evenflo Triumph and the knob tightening system on that is a pain also, so I think it is time to pay the price for a Britax, just for the ease of use. Luckily, the booster was purchased at Costco and they will take it back used and all for a cash refund!"
5,Pleased with Purchase,So far we have been quite pleased with this purchase. It was relatively easy to install. Loosening and tightening of the straps is simple. The cup holder is a nice touch. We look forward to the flexibility that this seat provides as our child continues to grow.
5,Great onine shopping experience,"This is my first time to shop on amazon.com, I moved to Asia for years from CA, USA.Not only the transaction very clear and fast, also the amazon.com products' indormation, spec., links and money save, all satisfied my tough engineer's requirement. I like this shopping experience, and next time, whatever my wife want to buy, I will suggest her to check amazon.com first. :))"
4,Good economical car seat,"This car seat is practical. I watch children out of my home and occasionally have to pick up my older daughter at school, at which time all the children must be loaded in the car. My personal favorite is a Britax but they are too expensive to purchase 4 or 5 to have in my car, therefore this works great for the occasional car ride."
4,Good seat for the money,"This seat is as described and a good value for the money. It's not the most COMFORTABLE seat in the world when compared to the previous one our 2 year old was in. However, she's never complained. I think it's fine. I am not sure why people complain about the straps; they are just like they are in every other car seat."
4,Great carseat for my granddaughter,The car seat is very roomy for a growing child and was easy to install. She seems to be very comfortable in it for the short distances that I usually take her. It was a great price and was delivered faster than I expected.
5,Great Affordable carseat,"We just ordered our 2nd Cosco carseat for Grandma's car. It is easy to install, easy to use, and very affordable for those on a budget!"
4,Great toddler and boster,We got this soon after our first grew out of the regular toddler seat. I found this easy to use and buckle. We love it. It easily converted to a booster seat too.
4,Good for the Cost,This is a good Product. This is my secondary car seat for my daughter who is 18 months old. Good Product for the money I paid. The build quality is good and it's comfortable.
4,"Great product, easy to install and handle.","For the price, this car seat is great. Seem similar products for double the price. Quality is also great."
3,good but not great,The massage portion was a bit of a disappointment. But is great for at-home pedicures.
3,Good but not Great,Works OK but would be better if it heated the water rather than requiring heated water.
2,A disappointment!,"I was disappointed with this product. It does not heat up like it says it does, and the ""massage"" was just an annoying vibration. I meant to send it back, but never got to the post office. It is still sitting in the box to return in my laundry room. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it now."
3,Great until the end,"As many discussed, this was a page turner. Sad to say, this author decided to deploy a pathetic marketing ploy. There is nothing so frustrating than to see ....""to be continued."" This alone made me vow to move on to other authors not quite so greedy."
5,Great for a book club,"We just read this book in our book club and we are all pleasantly surprised at what great discussion it generated. While reading the book, one can get a sense that parallel plots are orbiting the primary plot all the time but you never can quite put your finger on exactly what they are. As a group we all picked up on different concepts that once someone said it we would agree at how right on the person was and how we didn't come up with it on our own. After the discussion we all wanted to read the book again with our new insight into the book."
2,This book is not the best.,"I bought this book and struggled through it to review for my certication exam, and I did alright, but I noticed a few instances where either through typographical or proofreading errors the book presented incorrect answers to its sample problems. I also felt that this book's section on calculation review was written to sell the calculations manual available from the same series. If you haven't done serious calculation work for some time, this is not the review for you. I use calculutions frequently as I work, and even so, these authors managed to make me question my ability. There are probably better review books available, but I was too cheap to buy another after spending $35 on this one."
2,NOT the best out there!,"As a pharmacy-tech instructor, I've used this series and am not impressed--neither were most of my students. A new book (PTCE prep book) by Mosby is available and is excellent. Good luck to all taking the new computerized PTCE!"
1,Horrible book with lack of information,"This book is the worse book ever. It only has 50 pages to prepare you for the pharmacy technician and the rest are just exams. For those who have pharmacy experience, this book would be okay for you but for those like me who doesn't have any and would like to self-study, then it isn't for you. Honestly, the book is just a complete waste of money. It is only 170 pages or around there while the other books are over 400 pages. The book is also useless in preparing for the exam because I didn't pass by using this book. It does not mention drug interactions or touch on it unlike Del Mar's book. This book is a piece of crap. Do not buy and waste your money. You will not pass the exam if you buy this one because it barely expands on the topic. I recommend Del Mar's book because it has the most pages ever (600 pages.) Best book there. Just don't buy this one."
1,Disappointed,"To date I have still not received product I ordered and would like a refund immediately. I would have been cautious if I had read her previous reviews, apparently I am not the first person to purchase an item that they never receive. The money was taken from my account immediately but the shipment was never made. Amazon.com needs to review their sellers before people start looking at purchasing from other sources."
5,Very Well Done,This is a fabulous work. The book is large every page is like 2 pages of a regular size book. Great photos on all of the major breeds. The history section in the front is very informative. I read it cover to cover over time and this is the book I refer to when I want to show a breed to a friend.
3,Torin's Book Review,"The New Horse EncyclopediaThe New Horse Encyclopedia is your average encyclopedia. With facts diagrams, photos and all that jazz. You can find anything in there that you need to know. I'm not saying it's fun to read but it is easy to understand and it is quick and decisive in telling you stuff you need or want to know about horses. If you don't mind reading facts and if you don't know much about horses than this is the book for you. If you don't like reading facts than don't pick up this book."
5,Great addition to a fine train set,"Our son is almost three and he loves his Brio train collection, which just keeps growing. This is a wonderful addition to the set as it makes the trains, which kids normally have to push around the track, go by themselves.It can pull quite a few cars with easy and we were surprised to find that it managed to pull three cars up over the figure eight bridge, which is a fairly steep incline.It is a battery hog, but it is worth it. It brings the little wooden train set to life."
2,Battery beware,"This toy requires a specialized triangular shaped screwdriver to access the battery compartment. We have yet to locate this type of tool, so we have yet to enjoy this toy."
2,false!,The train does not autostop as advertised. My two year old forgets to turn it off (not that he could) and it just runs and runs until the battery dies.
4,Into The Pacific,"Another good tale that follows some little known historical events and the tremendous dangers seafarers faced. Fun to see the Galapagos Islands before Darwin with hints of what's to come. There are fascinating details on whales and whaling that would interest even landlubbers. Some quite surprising twists, from lesbian cannibals of Polynesia to 18th century abortion procedures again shows the wonderful depth of O'Brian's storytelling. A very fun read."
2,Huh?,This was the first book of the series that I've tried and this book did not catch my interest. Maybe I would have enjoyed it if I'd read some of the earlier ones but this book was very dull and had little action. I'll stick with Horatio Hornblower.
2,Hollywood should be happy,"The chance to make a movie better than the book. Maybe if you invested your time in reading all the books in this series you might feel an emotional attachment to these characters but from reading this one book I didn't. It wasn't hard to read as in challenging, it was hard to read because it didn't hold your attention. I could be slightly biased after reading the ""Lymond Chronicles"" if you want challenging, here's the series for you. Exciting and breathtaking and not enough words to describe the series. The ""Lymond Chronicles"" is the best of the best. Warning, the first book is the hardest to get through but so worth it at the end."
2,Am I missing something?,"This is my first O'Brian book, and after reading it, I can surely state that it will be my last! I don't get all the furor about what a great series this is, because I found that, even though I finished the book, I didn't enjoy it very much. The plot (what there was of it) moved at a snail's pace, and kept getting interrupted by naturalist lectures and other really boring asides between the characters. There was more than enough going on with nautical terms that had me scratching my head in puzzlement, and that certainly took away from the reading enjoyment. Nothing much happened in the book, and it went through several hundred pages for this nothing to finally come to an anticlimactic end. Mr. O'Brian certainly has his rabid fans, but I for one will not join them!"
5,A Magnificent Voyage,"This tenth novel in the Aubrey-Maturin has Captain Aubrey back in command of his beloved frigate ""Surprise"" and sailing around Cape Horn into the great Pacific Ocean in pursuit of the King's enemies - namely the French and the Americans. These novels give an extraordinarily minute portrait of naval life in the early nineteenth century, as well as a beautifully nuanced story of a male friendship. This episode takes us into remote waters including the Galapagos Islands where Doctor Maturin finds yet more strange birds and creatures. There's a shipwreck, a battle, and everything necessary for a thoroughly satisfying sea story."
2,Don't read this book first!,"I found this book in the airport news stand and bought it without having read any others of the series. While reading, I thought often about just putting the book down and going on to something else - I wasn't carrying anything else.Having read the other reveiwers, I will accept that possibly I would have been better able to understand the story's origins had I read the other 9 books first. Also, I accept that the vast amount of detail missing at the end of the book may be found in the next of the series. I thought - and still wonder - that maybe there are omission of paragraphs, pages, and possibly chapters from the printing I have.I was looking for a stand alone story, not a book I would need to read nine before-hand and one or more afterwards to ""finish"".If you want to read one book to decide if you like the series, this is not the one."
2,Not one for the time capsule,"The 10th book in the Aubrey-Maturin seagoing series. This was my least favorite so far in the series. O'Brian's books are always episodic, rather than plot-driven, but this story seemed even more of a collection of random incidents than usual. In this book, the Surprise is sent to protect the British whaling fleet in the Pacific. Along the way, there's adultery, a murder, a shipwreck, sharks, a lesbian band of runaway Polynesian women, and much, much more. Maybe O'Brian had writer's block and a deadline when he wrote this one, or maybe he was just ""having us on."""
2,Good Book Horrid structure,I don't know if it just the electronic version or if the printed version was the same way. It's a good book but the paragraph and chapter structure are almost nonexistent. One paragraph seemed to run over the course of several days starting with two characters having a conversation and going several more characters were the original two were no longer present and eventually ending with one of the original characters (I may be exaggerating but not by much).
4,Gift for my mother.,"The DVD came in perfect condition which is also great to see when being shipped from an online store but the reason why I did not give it 5 stars was because it is not the complete film. It is missing certain parts that was aired on Lifetime but it isn't in the movie, but beside that I would still reccoment this product."
5,No highs to my sub,"This was ideal to get rid of the highs from getting to my sub, works great! This was also shipped and received quickly."
3,Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes,I do not remember most of the nursery rhymes. The ones I do remember are incomplete. It is a good book to start out with nursery rhymes.
5,Easy install,"Pretty easy install, just have to find a route from trunk to the hitch, but no soldiering. Highly recommend."
4,Great customer service support,The product does everything I wanted. For my particular application I had to make some modificationsand the customer support at Hopkins knew exactly what I was attempting and how to create a successful installation.
3,Kit is a plus,"The item arrived and was installed as per instructions. Did not give 5 stars due to test probe light was so weak I had to test with shop lights off to see it light up and I thought it would have been a little better quality since it is an important part of the install. Other than the sad test light, the unit seem to be working well."
4,Great,"I bought this for my 2002 Rover, snipped the flat bar off and wired it to the 7-pin with no problem."
1,A disappointment,"I read Suzanne Strempek Shea's 3 previous novels and really enjoyed them. I was really excited when I found out she had a new book out and immediately checked out from the local library. I'm about 40 pages into it and don't think I care to finish it. There doesn't seem to be much happening so far and barely any dialogue. The descriptions are long-winded and put me to sleep and seem to take precedence over any kind of plot. I don't really care one way or another about the characters so far as I did in her previous books. I'm wondering if the author is trying out a new style. If so, I miss her old style. I'm glad I didn't purchase this book but only borrowed it. It's going back this week."
5,A meaningful story.,"To me, this is a very meaningful story, beautifully written with wit and wisdom. As with so many life experiences, we do go around again in some way and hopefully learn something in the process. I am a big fan of Suzanne Strempek Shea's books and look forward to many more stories from her creative and insightful mind. Her descriptive language is fascinating and thoughtful as she observes the life around her to skillfully share with others."
5,inspired,"So I helped inspire a new crocheter to further stretch her wings. I work among a number of crocheters and knitters where I feel I am the authority. I bought this book after going through it and finding a number of patterns I wanted to make for my daughters. I loved the instructions and learned something new from them. I've been crocheting for 30 years and have never found such complete information. I loaned the book last week to a new crocheter. The person who taught her to crochet never goes beyond simple squares that she can put together for a blanket. But crocheting offers so much more. This book helped me prove my point. Realizing what she could do, she bought a copy of the book herself and this morning showed me the shrug she is making. I feel I have enriched someone else's life with the help of this wonderful book."
3,Borrow it from the library,"This is a book you could live without. The really good part of it is the instructions part, where she shows how to make stitches and what they look like, and what you can do with them without a pattern. Ms. Stoller thinks she's really clever by putting in section headings using phrases that allude to pop culture and/or things that are inappropriate, but it's just tacky; and in all reality, classiness is free and doesn't make people sick or feel sorry for you.But, most of the patterns are obnoxious. A crocheted cowboy hat? Ipod animals? Crocheted flower brooches? Goodness, is she THAT desperate for patterns?There were a few good patterns in the book, though the models are really dorky. I have made one of the projects so far, and there may be about three more that I make in the time to come."
2,I don't get it,"I really liked the first Stitch and Bitch, but lost the reader since then. The last book was ok, but I found Vogue knitting much easier with less mistakes. Here again, there is a disconnect with the author so the content I am not understanding. Maybe I'll just take a class and get it."
4,Great Book,I bought this when all I knew was how to cast on and that I had forgotten already. This book taught me everything. I started with the easy patterns which a beginner should and then moved onto something harder. To learn how to do a hat I practiced doing round dollies and then took that skill to making a hat. If one doesn't practice the basics you can't move onto the patterns. Yes it was very difficult to get started. I Went online to watch you-tube videos of people doing the stitches because that's how I learn. But the instructions were the same. I still haven't made anything too complicated but this book got me pretty far. I can now read other patterns and complete them. Made 3 hats and a different looking scarf than the boring one everyone starts with using the shell pattern. Now I want to learn to knit and am considering getting her knitting book.
3,"Great Basics, Terrible past that","I got this book for Christmas and sped through the first portion. I learned the basics really easily, the book was laid out very conveniently and other than a few less than clear phrases it was great! But past the basics it didn't help me much at all, the only patterns I've tried have ended up with me tangled in knots and to frustrated to continue. I have taken the skills I learned and applied them to patterns elsewhere really easily and have had wonderful success. Enjoyed learning crochet very much and now love crochet especially amigurumi!"
3,very bad instrustions and a lot of mistakes,Although the designs and the concept of the good are very good. It's a disaster in instructions. It seems like this book was made in a hurry and they didn't have time to proofread etc. It has some good closeups of the finished products and this could help and also in some of the projects a diagram is included and this really answers some of the querries but still the whole thing is confusing.
5,50 and finally crocheting!,"For much of my life, friends have tried to teach me to crochet. I've tried to teach myself with other books, and decided to stick with knitting. My daughter, entranced by cute crocheted amigurumi creatures, wanted me to teach her to crochet. She found this book, while I was leafing through the same old stodgy books I *hadn't* learned from before, and we decided to give it a try.NOW I CAN CROCHET!!! The author's basic instructions are communicated in a clear and entertaining way that did the trick for me, and my daughter is learning quickly, too. In other reviews, I see that there are pattern corrections posted online, which is a great help. Yes, it would be better if they'd been caught before publishing, but, ah, well. The projects in the book look like fun - there are only one or two that neither my daughter nor I are interested in. In many of the other books available there were only one or two projects that we would have done."
1,too many errors in patterns,"BE WARNED! there are too many mistakes in this book. if u dont believe me, look at the online ""corrections and clarifications"" page. my advice: dont begin ANY project in this book b4 looking at this corrections page. the ratio of patterns with mistakes to the mistake-free patterns is astonishing. i want to love the author and the book (nice style, great projects, pictures and instructions) but i've never used another book that contains this many errors. insult to injury: the corrections page is hard to read AND CONTAINS ERRORS!!!"
1,"Good idea, but too much errata!","I'm an advanced crocheter and I've worked up several of the patterns in this book. While I love the hip designs and great explanations of the various stitches, the errata in the patterns leave me banging my head against the wall and spending lots of money on yarn for projects that have to be re-worked to get the desired end result. Debbie Stoller doesn't post the pattern errata online (maybe because she didn't write the patterns herself? I don't know), so obtaining corrected patterns is not an option. I'm rating this book low on the star scale as the purpose of this book is to successfully work the patterns and be proud with the end result, is not easily acheived with the errors."
1,"What good is a pattern book, when the patterns are all wrong?","There are some great patterns in this book... but SO many of them are wrong, mis-printed, and have errors! Some of the illustrations are wrong too.There are tons of updates on their website for the ""correct"" patterns (they call them erratas) - but what a pain to have to cross things out and re-write them. Isn't that the point of buying a pattern book, so that you have an easy reference?I purchased as a gift for my sister who is learning to crochet. The first half of the book is written for the beginner, with detailed instructions. She was so frustrated, after spending hours on a project, only to find it wasn't working. (it was after investigation I found the erratas)This book is headed for the recycle bin"
5,Super book for newbies to experienced crocheters~!,I love this book! The patterns are hip and easy to understand. I love the photos and she is very down to earth in her descriptions. No trying to decipher greek here! This book is worth buying. I'm a somewhat experienced crocheter that is in her 30's and this is the best book that I've seen in a while that isn't just afghans and winter hats..
3,cool crochet is hard to come by,"it's very difficult to find a book that treats crochet with the same new-found respect that's given to knitting, and while this addition to the stitch n bitch line up is good in that respect, as for learning and inventive ideas, i would by far recommend Erika Knight's books, particulary ""Simply Crochet"""
3,Happy hooker,"I bought this in the hopes that I would be able to find a useable pattern for items. for me some of the items are too off the wall. a crochet bikni? I doubt if I will be lounging by my pool in one any time soon. It does have patterns for nubie's, or a skull cap, there is a pattern for a purse, but it has tacky flowers on it, I left those off of mine. It does cover the basics on the art, and the patterns are eaily read. I have used this book 2 times and I bought it a year ago. Everyone else maybe singing it's praises, but I'm being honest. Don't let the wildness of the title lure you in. check the book out in a bookstore before purchase."
1,"Not a total bust, but...","The patterns are cute, the layout of the book is phenomenal and it's instructions are easy enough for a beginner to learn from.However there are patterns that are a little... off. And by off I mean, holy cow, how did this get into publication being so flawed?? Somethings I was able to just ""wing it"" and others... not so much. The book isn't a total waste, but if you don't go into it knowing of the flaws then you're in for a nasty shock in some cases. I would recommend getting this book second hand, but for full price? Not so much."
4,This is my new favorite crochet book.,"I bought this to supplement my knitting and I'm glad I did. I don't usually crochet a whole garment, but there are a lot of well-designed, fitted garments in here that I'm going to try. None of those outdated boring shapeless patterns. Even the cute & fast patterns have a little edginess to them. Cleverly written with humor and good fundamental crocheting instructions. I already made the Garden Scarf with leftover yarn. Adorable."
3,So So,"Overall, I like this book. It's nicely organized, has good visuals, some good ideas...I give three stars for effort. However, I just can't stand the language used in this book. It's just too corny like they're trying to dumb down to a 10 year old. The patterns are also so-so---nothing special for all the hype this series has received. Props for trying to be hip, but it's ""hip"" in a Nickelodeon sort of way, very cliched teenager stuff with skulls and all."
5,I dont know how she did it!,"I have tried, over and over and OVER again to learn how to crochet,off and on for over a year. I was starting to give up,then along came this amazing book, the answer to all of my crocheting prayers.I had picked up Ms. Stollers Stitch n' Bitch book earlier, in an attempt to re-introduce myself to hand knitting, and it had gone so well, that I didn't think twice before plunking down my money for this book.It took me less than a day to get through the basics.The instructions seem a bit funky at first, each lesson takes a couple of read-thoughs before you can make sense of what you need to do, but trust me, the instructions will click!Although it may help to have your boyfriend on the phone cheering you on. ^^Give this book a shot, it's nice and thick, with great glossy pics and lots of random splashes of color. Full of puns, and just a general joy to read. I will be buying more for several ladies in my family."
5,i couldn't do crochet until i bought this book,"AWESOME I'd recommend it to anyone. Her pictures/diagrams are GREAT if you're a visual person. Such a great book, I carry it around with me"
5,Taught this knitter to crochet,"I am a knitter and despite being told that crocheting is so much easier, I didn't get it. On the cover, it claims that it can even teach a knitter to crochet. I decided to give it one more whirl. She is right! This book can even teach a knitter to crochet. Now I am still a knit wit, but I am learning to enjoy crocheting too. Oh and when to make a project in knit or crochet. If you are a knitter and just don't get crochet .. . this book can help."
4,Interesting...,"The instructions are the best part of this book: clear, color-coded, concise, and clever. (Ooh, alliteration.) Some of the patterns are also quite lovely. Others, though, as another reviewer stated, are hideous. However, the diagrams and clear instructions make it worth checking out, since other manuals' descriptions of a simple stitch look like a Madden football diagram run amok."
5,The Happy Hooker,This is the best Crochet book I have seen. I highly reccommend it to new as well as old crocheters. Love it.
1,Not worth the hype,I have seen this book way overstocked at the book store and wondered what the fuss was about. I happen to my neighbors garage sale and saw that she had it for $2.00. I got home and tried it but it was too cutesy to follow. Thank god I only paid $2.00.
1,Copy of other peoples' work,This book from title right through to content is a copy of other peoples' work. If you want a good crochet book to learn from I suggest Vogue Knitting on the Go: Crochet Basics (Vogue Knitting On The Go) by Trish Malcolm.
1,Mediocre at best,Happy Hooker is neither a book about a hooker or how to crochet. This is less than mediocre - try Vogue Knitting on the Go: Crochet Basics (Vogue Knitting On The Go).
2,Editor needs to take another look,"This books has so much potential, but I was severely disappointed by all the errors in the patterns. It literally makes it difficult to follow. They are such cute projects, and it is a shame, but I don't recommend this book until it has a make-over. The errata page on [...] has errors, too. (for errata: [...]"
3,"I, too crochet mainly in summer","Why? I crochet potholders in the summer and knit afghans the rest of the year. Afghans get awfully hot once they're a foot or so long.That said, ""Happy Hooker"" lacks the charm of ""Stitch 'n Bitch Nation."" It's a good instructional guide, and these patterns are ones I could probably follow, but it just isn't as good. Maybe it's because the ""S&B;"" stories are lacking; I don't know.My recommendation: Check it out from the library or borrow it from a friend before purchasing."
3,Way too many errors,"I'm glad I checked this book out of the library before parting with my hard-earned cash. As with the majority of crochet books, there is little here for anyone with experience. Almost half the book is taken up with basic stuff that I really don't need to see (or pay for) in EVERY book of patterns, and most of the items are a tad on the young side for me. However, I don't expect all books to be written according to my personal taste, so with that said:At first glance, it appears pretty good for beginners, but closer inspection reveals a huge number of mistakes that's likely to deter a lot of newbies from persevering. After all, in my experience, those new to the fabulous craft of crochet don't know about errata addenda. Basic information, e.g., whether the turning chain counts as a stitch, is missing, and stitch counts are incorrect on at least two of the patterns. This is what really lets it down. It's a pity because I like to see books that make learning crochet fun."
3,Missing directions,"Ther are pattern errors in this book. All of the corrections can be found on line, but I think they need a new editor. The fingerless gloves are missing several rows. The pattern didn't turn out right. Other than errors, it is a good book. Just Google the pattern for corrections before you start."
5,Best Beginner Crochet book EVER!!!!,"After trying to learn to crochet from several other books, and people, ""Happy Hooker"" really came through for me! The projects are wonderful, both fun and practical. The pictures are beautiful, and the instructions are easy to understand. I would suggest this book for any person, on any level, of any age. I especially like that the book does not label the projects as being for beginners, advanced, etc., therefore I was more likely to attempt a project based on my taste, rather than whether or not i thought i could do it. After a year and a half of crocheting on a steady basis, this is the only book that i always keep in my crochet bag. I would suggest however that you purchase the hardcover, because i had to replace the paperback after 6 months because i used it so much, that it fell apart."
4,Fun patterns,"I am enjoying this book for the fun patterns and ideas and have made a few things already. I am new at crochet - (but I was doing a short course at the same time as buying the book) and did become frustrated with some of the pattern errors. Some patterns give incomplete directions for stitches - why explain how to execute the stitch if you are going to neglect to tell people to yarn over first? I read patterns from the book alongside a 4 page crochet 'how to' from my local yarn store which makes life easier. It is well worth it for the patterns and ideas, but I wouldn't rely on it as my crochet 'how to' bible."
5,Happy Hooker and Happy buyer,"This is a lovely book to buy, useful information, stitch techniques and lovely patterns. I'm very happy with it."
3,Good and Bad...,"Okay so I admit, I have actually read all four of Debbie Stoller's major books. I really appreciate how clear her instructions are and how well she explains the technique for beginners. My objection is not to the writing but to the language. Why is it at all appropriate to use a word like B**** in the title of the series? I cannot use these books to teach most anyone (though I got them in College) because the foul language is embarassing. I cannot use them with Children or with the people who want to learn through the church for really obvious reasons. This language may be okay in Ms. Stoller's little universe but not in mine. If not for the unfortunate language and crude jokes, I would recommend them heartily... Unfortunately, she does not consider that her audience may find such things even slightly inappropriate. Her loss. I will not buy any more of her books or recommend them to students or friends."
2,"Not for beginners, but nice pictures","I'm a complete beginner and found some of the instructions and explanations obtuse and cryptic. I ended up pulling out a 'Learn to Crochet in a Day' pamphlet I picked up 10 years ago where I found really detailed explanations for the absolute beginner. The book is slick and looks nice, but I was disappointed in the content. The fluff about the origins of crocheting could have been omitted."
3,Cute stuff-but not really for beginners,"Some of these patterns are cute, but I often found similar items online for free. My biggest complaint as a newbie to crochet is that her patterns often describe a very particular yarn, presumably one that needs to be ordered from a specialty store. If you are a beginner, you should start off with materials you can find cheaply at your local craft store. It would be helpful if they'd suggest alternative yarns for practice.Aside from this, the intros and instructions in the beginning chapters were helpful, and did a lot to show how and why you do certain things."
5,Even crocheters can learn from this book,"I've been crocheting for over 40 years, but some stitches and methods I'd never learned; and, of course, some I've forgotten. This book demonstrates everything about crocheting, and it's a fun read to boot."
2,Needs some serious updates,Learning to crochet can be tedious and frustrating. It's hard to be enthusiastic about learning when the patterns you have to work on are for garments you would never ever wear.
3,I'm new and it looks great but...,"I am new to crocheting and this book has really great illustrations. It starts out simply but moves to more difficult patterns a bit too fast for me. I was kind of lost once I learned the beginner stitches. Also, it's an awkward size. Hard to leave open to read. Had it been spiral bound, it would have been much easier to use!"
2,Too Many Mistakes In This Book,"I have been crocheting for years, and teach a crochet group. Members of the group, and I bought a copy of this book. We are very disappointed with all the mistakes in the book. I even had to go online to get corrections of the mistakes in the book."
3,Not the S&B I hoped for,"I looked through this book and saw very few patterns I actually liked, and of the ones I did, they were pretty unoriginal; many magazines have very similar patterns recently. It didn't live up to the Stich & Bitch splendor I had hoped for, but as a reference and jumping-off point, I'd recommend it."
3,Handy book to keep around but for one thing.,"This is a wonderful and fun book! Even if you don't like any of the patterns, the stitch guide in the front makes it worth it. The biggest issue with this book is the binding. The book falls apart. This is my second copy. I had to keep collecting the pages and putting them in folders as they fell out. Im going to be putting the first copy in a three ring blinder now. Thats the only reason I gave it three stars. If the binding had been better i would have given it five stars."
3,"Humor, wit and mistakes.","I am well aware that there are mistakes in the patterns. There is even a disclaimer in the book stating that you should check the website for corrections in the patterns. Not that hard. Really.I love the Stitch N Bitch Knitting book. It prompted me to buy this book. I was very happy to feel the same tone in this book. It makes me want to learn how to crochet better, above and beyond the chain stitch. Note to self-check the website before beginning any pattern!"
5,Nice and modern,"This book is definitely well written and serves as a great beginner crochet guide (plus patterns). It explains not only how to do things, but the technical reasons why you do it (e.g. how to do increases to maintain a circle that doesn't ruffle/ripple).The patterns are nice and fresh, leaning towards things that people living in 2013 would find appealing, but doesn't completely neglect 'old school' patterns either (e.g. granny squares).Even intermediate crocheters will find useful information in this book."
5,Love this book!,This has been my favorite crochet book! The patterns are hip and the author does a fantastic job of breaking things down into easy steps.
4,His 2nd best CD,I gave this CD 4 stars cuz last dance is great but amerikkkas nightmare is better. You gotta get this CD Gunz & Money is the best!
1,didn't receive product,I didn't receive the DVD's. I was told I would get a refund and I haven't seen that yet either.
4,Good Book,"If you are interested in camping, this book has great information about things that will smooth out the rough edges. Worth the read."
1,Filled with logical inconsistancies,"It was no secret that K had a long term relationship. He told some of his close friends about it. It's a private matter anyway. Radha's account on the other hand is not an expose, it is a nasty, malicious character attack of a man who is dead and can't defend himself.Her book is filled with logical inconsistencies: conclusions that simply do not add up. A book by someone who totally missed the boat for those who've missed the boat and are looking to rationalize it. Radha wrote to me that ultimately because of freedom of speech she can say anything she wants. That's how she justified the logical inconsistencies!! Too bad she didn't have the guts to do that when K was alive."
3,Forget about the man; contemplate the message,"Either Krishnamurti's ""message"" is true or it is not. Why do we care about the man himself? Krishnamurti himself urged us not to consider him a guru or focus on his ""legacy"". Regardless of what personal behavior he engaged in, one must determine for oneself if the words he spoke through the course of his life were simply words, or the reflection of a ""reality"" that is independent of our need to connect the image of a man to some potentially deeper truth. Maybe everything he said was pure fantasy, not applicable to the human condition. But that judgement has nothing to do with any new evidence that may or may not come to light with regard to Krishnamurti's personal behavior. Let's just all try to figure it out for ourselves and not be too quick to put anyone on a pedestal nor cast him/her down."
2,Lives in denial,"Having read most books on Krishnamurti, I would give this book only two stars. Lutyens decided not to disclose the extent of the personal relationship even though by her own admission she knew about it from Krishnamurti himself. To that extent Sloss is accurate. However, Sloss is living in complete denial by not acknowledging either the culpability of her father who was a court established embezzler of public funds, not to mention her mother who was a married woman at the time she began her relationship with Krishnamurti. There are some other allegations against Krishnamurti as well but the lack of any objective evidence indicates they are likely a projection of personal bitterness. Sloss has certainly not helped her credibility by waiting for several years after Krishnamurti's death to go public with her version of events that took place many decades earlier."
1,"Assumptive,Speculative,presumptuous.","I found the book to be highly presumptuous,misleading,and bias,in favor of her parents point of view!The only thing I would suggest is that one should read Krishnamurti,and the Rajagol's by Mary Luytens.They were using the affair between K and Rosaland as a blackmail tool to keep Krishnamurti from legally exposing gross abuse of monies gifted to the work of K , by D. Raja."
5,Hypocrisy and Ego Exposed,"This book brings a much needed balance to the legacy of Krishnamurti. I am amused by the reviews below that implore us to separate the man from his teachings, as if this would maintain the purity of the teachings. So much for wholeness and integrity then. What are we to make of teachings that even the teacher cannot be touched by? What are we to make of a teacher who near the end of his life says that no one has ever ""got it"" and that he alone understands the ""truth""? Such people are called egotistical. Read this book and de-program yourself."
1,A SLANDEROUS EXERCISE OF IMAGINATION.....,"I recently read this work by Mrs. Sloss. I've read many Krishnamurti works and willingly read this book as it presents a different opinion of the man. The conclusions as to Krishnamurti's motives, etc. are entirely imaginative in my humble opinion. It may have been a good sell had it not been so blatantly biased, basically the ramblings of a jilted lover filtered through her daughter who seeks to weave a very tall tale indeed. Shame, shame. While I would not recommend buying this book, if you must read it, borrow it instead!! In addition though, please read another book after that provides a most excellent response by Mary Lutyens called ""Krishnamurti and the Rajagopals."" Only then will you be able to determine for yourself what the real story is!..."
2,Stop preaching your faith for a minute!,"Let me say...I believe in God and try to live a spiritual life, but give me a break!Had a difficult time getting through this one. Ms. Fuller spends WAY too much time going on about religion, faith and God and not nearly enough time on the idea of teaching kids about music which is why I picked up the book! If I wanted a book on spirituality, I would've gotten one! It seems that every turn, Fuller is finding some excuse to go on about her religious fervor.Why do some Christians feel that they have to hit us over the head with their faith?I was very disappointed at all the dogma I had to wade through to get to what the book was SUPPOSED to be about!I would suggest that you try to find another book on this topic before trying this one."
3,Oracle Ebusiness Suite,I found the book very helpful as it did not assume previous knowledge of the topics but taugth them like i was a novice. I look forward to buying more books.
1,Living Landscapes Bali HD DVD,"I bought it. Too bad we can't view it. NONE of the computers, laptops, portable players or televisions the family and extended family own will open the program."
4,"I like this box set, but it's a little bit structured","It's nice to have this box set and while I had alot of these songs on other albums, the recordings are all different. They are a little bit too structured for my preference in comparing them to other Diz albums, but it's still well worth having particularly if you're as big a Diz fan as I."
5,How Bitter Sweet It Is,"Although I love all things Propaganda (OK, ""1234"" I only kinda liked), my favorite composition from ""A Secret Wish"" was, is, and always will be ""Duel."" So I've been waiting nearly 20 years for a CD release of the Bitter Sweet remix that I originally owned on vinyl (still own, actually, along with its two decades of hiss and pop). Now I can die happy: There's the extended intro with the buildup of instruments, then Claudia's vocal sounding clearer than ever, and finally the mournful guitar solo that takes the track out. I'm not usually nostalgic for my lost 80s youthfulness, but the first time I played it, this disk had me on my knees . . . ."
3,Some colors better then others,I have used these pencils for a few hours now. I'm not sure why but some colors blend better then others. The pink and violet blend very badly leaving small white spots even if I use the tinniest bit of water on my brush. I am using watercolor paper but perhaps the paper isn't the right type.The plus side is these have really sparked my interest to look further into higher quality pencils. I will still keep these around but for the first time in my life the art supplies are what is holding me back not my talent. heheThey are ok watercolor pencils but I think I'm going to look into Derwent INKTENSE pencils because judging by youtube videos they work better with water then these.
2,Not as expected,It does not mention in the description that these colors are to be use dry and then use a wet paintbrush for effect. We thought we were buying the kind you apply wet. We are returning these.
4,Good basic text on photography,"Well written, informative with decent illustrations and photos. Good book for photo beginners. Used copies are generally pretty inexpensive so go for it."
3,Kindle 2 version just OK,"In response to reviewer wondering why only 2 reviews, I might assume peeps prefer the mobi edition. For 4 bucks you get all Pope's works PLUS index and table of contents.If I were still a student I might have pounced on this wonderful freebie. Fortunately I can spare a few bucks today for ease of use.When purchasing freebies, remember: you get what you pay for.I think Pope said that."
3,Classic Lambadas,"This is a pretty good CD for dancing Lambada. It's a bit tacky, but it's hard to get good Lambada anywhere, so this CD is suitable. Most songs are pretty catchy, even if it's all done on a synthesiser (or sounds like it!). I wouldn't pay a lot of money for this CD, but if it's a bargain then go for it!"
4,Those Charming Men,"Not a bad band by any means Gene,however, never did forge their own identity remaining basically a less inspired version of the Smiths even if ""Olympian"" wouldn't embarass Morrissey and Marr's album record had it been theirs.The title track,""Left Handed"",""To the City""and ""Haunted by you""are the clear highlights."
5,good for Pool equipment,"I used this stuff on a spider gasket for my multiport valve and to seal some PVC threaded connectors for a pool pump. I simply squeezed some out over the teflon tape. It's a bit sticky and messy, but does the job. No leaks!"
5,The finest Xmas music you will find.,"After being sick of hearing so much average Xmas music, this album is a joy. Wonderful arrangements and voices.....really a superb recording."
2,Rope chain,"Was very pleased to recieve this Beautiful rope chain at first.I ordered this chain for a friend, replacing a much thinner chain which always got tangled. Unfortunately he started getting a bad rash around his neck from this chain after a few weeks use.Be careful."
4,"Great price, great product, friendly customer service","I have been delighted with all of the lovely silver chains I have purchased from Gem Ave. Out of 6-8 ordered, only this chain arrived with 2 or 3 chinks. I called the company and the chain was replaced within 3 days without any hassles. The new chain was strong with a secure Italian lobster clasp. It had a lovely shine, without being ""glaring"" and artificial looking. It came in a small, wrappable gift box and will make a wonderful present paired with the silver pendant I have in mind. If it was possible to give a four and a half star rating on this product, I would have done it!"
2,Feels cheap,"It's okay, have worn it a few times and it looks okay but it is so lightweight... not a great buy even at this price."
4,Stiff but nice,"it has very little give in the arch. It cannot be bent like the picture, and would likely snap with that much pinch (or that forceful of a tug on your pendant). Otherwise, it looks nice."
2,Would not purchase again!,This item shipped folded up in a little bag. It had lots of kinks in it. Would not purchase again!
4,Enjoyable,"Not as good as ""Persian Pickle Club"", but still very readable and entertaining. I remain a staunch Dallas fan!"
5,The reason Southern men are fascinated by Northern Women,This is not one of those southern novels that are written to be sold one after the other.(Adrianna and Fannie etc. etc.) Those looking for that kind of drivel may be dissapointed as this is a real book about real people...Think was first fiction written by author published in 1990. Stories like this may not need to be set up- just written the way they happened so can be believed except for the last page when the 70 year old author decked another author who dared to write as if he knew what had really happend.Gotta admit even I found that a stretch of the imagination
3,This book really draaaags until the last third.,"I think the cover art is the best thing about this book. The story is slow, slow, slow until the last third, when it improves considerably. Still, if a friend were considering reading this, I would steer her away. I enjoyed ""Persian Pickle Club"" (another Dallas title) twice as much, but still only rated that a 7."
3,"Sorry, not for me","This is our reading group's March selection--otherwise, I'd not have stayed with it. It simply seemed too contrived, from the names (Whippy Bird, Effa Commander--always use the whole name!, Bumbo, Moon, and so forth), to the oh-so-tragic ending of movie star Marion Street. I felt manipulated, after having read nearly 3/4 of the book, to finally encounter the crime and scandal, only to see it brushed over in a very few pages. And then we never exactly find out the true story--who ends up protecting whom in the scandal? For a story purporting to tell the ""real story,"" this one falls short."
3,A slow read,"I have read all three of Sandra Dallas' books and maybe I shouldn't have read them one right after the other. This was the last one I read and I had a really hard time getting through this one. The characters were interesting and enjoyable but the story took a long time to get to the point, which WAS interesting once it finally got to the point. There were just too many un-necessary background details given. Like I said maybe I read too many of these books at once..."
2,disappointed,"I have read Sandra Dallas's other books and loved them.This was very disappointing. I kept reading and hoping it would get better, but it did not. If it had been the first of her writings for me to read, it would likely have been the last. I am glad I saved it for last, because I really loved her other work."
4,"Buster is a fun , engaging read.",This book is great for a fun Summer afternoon read on the porch swing. It is fun and easy reading. Sandra Dallas pulls you so deeply into each character that you leave the book with new friends.
5,not just carbon based,"The words of Olds' poems in this book encompass such daring, personal subjects that I was left stunned. Who else but Sharon Olds could make a beautiful poem about watching menstrual blood flow into the toilet by comparing it to ballet dancers? Who else would push the enevelope of public disgust enough to compare vaginal secretion and diamonds? She speaks and glorifies the unmentionable and ugly. In this way, she truly remakes the female body as she writes of it. The experience of reading Olds is not just intellectual; it is a visceral enlightenment."
1,Uninteresting navel-gazing,"What is it about journalists that they think their lives are so interesting? I'm tired of reading books and articles like this. Stapinski is one of the worst of the lot; she seems to believe that the world is dying to hear everything about her life, her family, her career. Please, spare us."
2,never a good shave,It took me longer to shave with this razor than it does to shave with a blade. I always had razor burn after using this. If you want a good shave get a safety razor.
1,Disappointing,This shaver was defective and had to be returned to seller. I did receive full refund (minus shipping).
4,EARLY SCHUBERT.,4 STARS because these are his early works by SCHUBERT.they sound fine but not like the later ones.These sound fine but much shorter.But they are srill worth hearing.
1,Not happy with this car seat,"I purchased this seat after it received a favorable review from Baby Bargains. I was fairly happy with the seat at first -- it reclines much more than our Britax seat and is good for long trips with a baby. The fabric seems cheap and the straps and buckle are difficult to work with, though. After approximately six months of use, we went to turn the seat forward and found that the seat foam was actually disentegrating under the outer cover. I had to vacuum out the car to get it all up (and I've never even put the cover through the wash). I'm contacting Combi to try and get a return."
4,Good book for reviewing USMLE Step2,"I just took Usmle Step 2 last month. The questions in this book are shorter than those of real USMLE Exam, but it contains a lot of high yield information. Make sure that you understand the answere at the end of each exam before you go to the next one."
5,excellent,I heard both positives and negatives about this book but I love to have it. It has been pretty much helpful.
4,Good read,Another excellent Bolitho novel. One in a long range over years of his naval careerand all are interesting. This one is a good read
4,"Reproduction, not Reprint","I didn't realize when I bought this book that it was a reproduction of the original manuscript (i.e photocopy). The typeset is hard to read, since they used different typeset conventions at the time of original printing, and some of the content is illegible. I would have preferred a reprint in modern typeset, even if it was not using modern English. The content is fabulous; Watts was a genius. And it's kind of neat to have the reproduction, as a way to see what the original manuscript looked like."
2,Not a well-produced video,"I was very disappointed in this video -- the script jumped around from one place to another and back again, it was not in depth, and was only 28 minutes. I found a much better DVD of the same area (not through Amazon) by Smart Travel. This truly was one of the most poorly produced travel videos I have seen -- I felt like it was a waste of my $15.Languedoc"
1,No egg roll?,"Typical ""cloak & dagger"" film made way back when. Cooper walking around with a monkey was dumb. Madaline Carroll was beautiful. The russian actor made up to be Chinese, not good. Poor story line."
4,sampler of recordings made between 1953 and 1959,"This disk is a sampler of recordings made between 1953 and 1959 featuring among others Oscar Peterson, Ray Brown, Gerry Mulligan (on two cuts), and Billy Strayhorn (on ""Chelsea Bridge""). About half are ballads showcasing Webster's fat breathy vibrato, the remainder are more uptempo. String accompaniment on three of the from the Ellington book (""Chelsea Bridge,"" ""Prelude to a Kiss,"" and ""What Am I here For?"")."
1,Do not bother,"This book is just tripe to feed off the the ""vampire community."" Virtually all of the Egyptian references have been culled from the Temple of Set's Order of the Vampyre which predates this book and the ""vampire community."" If you really want to learn about vampires I suggest you look into the Temple of Set's Order of the Vampyre instead of white washed right hand path material such as this."
4,not a karaoke fan,"i put this in my player with some others i was checking out and found it to be very good. tracks are pretty woman, great balls of fire, paradise by the dashboard light and after midnight. 2 tracks each, 1 vocal and 1 instrumental."
3,A young marine's experiences during the Battle of Okinawa,"This book provides an ""up close and personal"" view of the Battle of Okinawa as seen through the eyes of a young marine rifleman. It's value is that it takes the reader into the minds of the writer and his fellow marines. However, there are numerous typographical and factual errors that compromise its usefulness as a serious reference book about the Okinawan people and their culture. Approach it as an action novel, rather than as a scholarly treatise on the subject, and you won't be disappointed."
3,you sent me the wrong size,I like the helemt but I din't like the fact that you sent me the wrong size and you wanted me pay for shipping both ways to get the right size it is not fair
4,It's worth it just for the Merrill chapters,"The chapters on the Pentateuch; Chronicles; Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther; and Ezekiel and Daniel all by Eugene Merrill were great. As an interesting central theme for the Old Testament, Merrill presents a return to man's dominion stated in Gen. 1:26-28. In the chapters he writes, Merrill ties the OT text into this concept very nicely. The other chapters also have a wealth of information, but are much less centralized around a theme. While I recommend reading the whole book, these chapters make it especially worthwhile."
5,biography as art,"One cannot improve upon the remarks fore-mentioned of George Bernard Shaw's. Long before public figures of no talent were thrust upon us, literate minds instead of marketeers gathered around the chosen few as johnny-come-latelys and would rarely disappoint. This is a thrilling,gripping read.Style,tact and endless grace in words for a tragic,painful public artist run throughout this personal account.Much can be gained from savoring this moment in time if one aspires celebrity and fame and wants to avoid its dizzying pitfalls."
3,Good book but no translation,"I bought this book because recently I recorded The Magic Flute opera from PBS (TV station), performed by The Metropolitan Opera New York (MET) in English. The channel was in high-definition. I'm dissapointed with the book because there was no English translation at all in the book but it didn't mean I could not enjoy the book. Because I have the book, I notice the English opera version (perform by MET) contains removed parts. For example, the overture was cut by half. Maybe it is to shorted the performance."
5,Mozart's The Magic Flute,"This was a wonderful story well written for a young audience. We bought it for our six-year-old son who began studying violin a year ago, and this was his one-year anniversary present. Mozart's Eine Kleine Nacht Musik was his inspiration to learn the violin, and he has since taken interest in other Mozart music. The illustrations are also very beautiful."
4,Peculiar choice,"Nice idea to provide the series in a DVD-on-demand format, but what a peculiar choice to bring out the final season with all episodes, EXCEPT the final episode (PCA Confidential).They did something similar with the first season of Drake & Josh, skipping 4 episodes, but including 4 episodes that were distributed on DVD already (of course, in later seasons, many more episodes were skipped).But I support the request to bring out more Nickelodeon series. Not mentioned so far: The Brothers Garcia."
3,"Interesting period piece, but Hornblower is better.","Treason's Harbour is an extremely slow paced story of mild intrigue in Malta. The period details sound a bit strained--would Jack Aubrey really treat his diamond headband so recklessly? And the two minor naval engagements seem thrown in for no other reason than to justify the cover. I certainly feel that I know more about eighteenth century music parties of the Mediterranean than I have any business knowing. Overall, the novel was not terrible, but I wish I'd re-read a Hornblower novel instead."
3,Treading water,"Not the best of the series, it seems to mark time somewhat (or, in better nautical parlance, to tread water). This means though that it's an essential read if you're reading the series in order since it fills in some things that were skipped by in earlier installments and lays the groundwork for what I hope will be more exciting days ahead."
5,A Nest of Vipers,"This is one of the better stories in a superb series. A nice mix of warfighting on the high seas and espionage skullduggery, both of which O'Brain excells in. In this one, O'Brian shows his two protagonists doing what they do best. Maturin uncovering the plots of the traitors and turning them to his advantage; and Aubrey skillfully and cunningly fighting his ship."
4,vintage O'Brian,Exciting as usual. The development of Maturin's character especially satisfying. This does seem more like the first half of a longer book.
4,&&&&&&&,Don't ask me again. I am already tired of reviews. Thank you. Aaaaaaa BBBBB CCCCCC BHHHHHB DD VB. DFFG DFHHJJ.
4,Does Mr. Midshipman Williamson have two hands?,"In ""The Ionian Mission,"" Mr. O'Brian causes Mr. Williamson to lose an arm:And a third [ball], fired as Jack was giving Williamson ordersto carry forward, took the boy's arm off at the elbow.Now, in this next novel, Mr. Williamson washes face, neck, and both hands. Actually, throughout this novel, Mr. Williamson works like a midshipman with two hands (and arms).Otherwise, this is another fascinating O'Brian novel."
3,John,"Good series. Start with first book or it won't be as interesting. The series has some of the same elements, but are limited compared with the books, and put together quite differently. The author's style takes some getting use to. He uses phrases that sometimes require interpertation (foreign language, french, latin and others)which you learn to skip. Kind of skips through actions. More about the doctor than the captin. Like C.S. Forester better."
3,For beginners only,"I have been a Novell dealer since the 80's. I also have extensive Unix (SCO) experience, though my Linux experience is much weaker.We had already spent about six weeks with OES Linux. It was a rough ride (and still is a little bumpy at times). It could have been smoother had I had this book from the beginning.Unfortunately, we had already learned most of what this book had to tell us from the school of hard knocks.The most disappointing part was the troubleshooting section. It was limited to telling us where to find the log files--something we figured out weeks ago.What we're hoping for is a ""Mastering Novell OES Linux"" that goes into each component (namcd, ndsd, nss, ldap, etc.) and takes it apart, gives you all the gotchas and gives you possible causes when things don't go as planned."
5,"""Just When I Thought I Knew It All""",Having read all there was to read on rifles and cartridges since the 1950's I have rarely found examples of the keen insight routinely offered in this first rate manual. A lifetime of focused education and a touch of true genious have melded to produce the gemstone of all reloading manuals.
3,A-Square reloading manual,"Generally it was a very good book, but a bit more of a ""book"" for reading than a manual. I thought there would be more different wild cat loads in the manual, but I would still highly recommend the book to any reloader."
5,Excellent!!!,Every hip hop fan should have a copy. The CD is awesome! The production is tight and every song is hot!!!!!! The Bioniq Emcee is a very talented artist and lyricist...
2,Wish it had worked,I wish I could say that my wife's sciatica had gone away or that it had even reduced the pain or even left it the same. In stead she has pain in additional places. We have waited in hopes (as it said in the DVD) that the body was remembering old injuries but the new pains haven't abated. We did 2 sessions a week apart. My wife is afraid to do the third.The sheet accompanying the dvd was not helpful. The pictures were poor and so close up that you often could not tell where on the body the moves were being applied. Plus no stickers shown. It would have helped also if the photographer of the DVD had stepped back more often so we could have seen the whole picture - stickers and or movement better. Especially on the boomerang and thumb chase.I believed it when they said you couldn't hurt people with this procedure.Silly Me.
5,Don't shy away from this one!,"Many a twist and turn - no one is who they seem. The ending may be too neat and tidy, but still a great cast of characters and Peter's charming telling make this a good read."
2,not their best,"Izze sparkling juices are generally pretty good. This one, unfortunately, is not. All I can taste in it is apple juice."
3,Stylishly unreliable,"While the keyboard is great, the touchpad leaves much to be desired. It is much less responsive than a Vaio notebook's touchpad. The mouse wore out after a year, no longer allowing you to hold down the left button in order to drag windows etc across the screen. I cannot really recommend this."
2,Cheap piece of garbage,The mouse cursor started jumping around like crazy after a couple of months and the keyboard went completely dead a couple of months later.
3,It looks good,"Even though the sandbox was easy to assemble, my husband feels it is overpriced and the sides should be deeperFor the $. The kids seem to like it but he's afraid our 5 year old grandson may outgrow it too fast which with forceUs to buy more rails to make it deeper. It is however very well-made."
2,"Cheaply Made sand box, build your own","My husband put it together and it was cheaply made, He had to use his own screws to ensure it was secured tightly. Some boards crakced when hammering them together lightly!!!! Would not buy for this price!!"
2,Missed the Mark,"Boy did this book leave we wanting. There is no front matter to describe how to use the book. Probably because the pages aren't organized for the user to record information useful in tasting and rating cigars. The space for placing the cigar bands is too small for most bands and the comments section is way to small to record all the pertinant information regarding taste, construction, appearance, aroma, etc. There is only one box to record the wrapper and no space dedicated to recording the binder or filler information. The filler is probably the most important regarding the taste of the cigar and yet there is no place to record this information!This book was published in 1995 and was clearly sold to make a buck during the cigar boom of the '90s. This was not made by a person in tune with those of us looking for a cigar log book with substance."
3,Pretty good but,Hey I have been a Robin Trower fan for many years. This is a good CD and its got some great guitar playing. However this isn't as strong a work as his early days. I think one thing is the vocals. His Dylan like singing is Ok but the best songs on this CD are the ones where his Co singer sings. His guitar playing is as incredible as ever and its always great to hear anything from this incredible underated musician. I actually liked 20th century blues better than this CD. But however this CD is still worth the money for any Trower fan. Keep putting out albums Robin we will never get enough of them.
4,Rock solid effort!,"This a very solid recording start to finish. As much as I hate to admit it, many of Robin's albums (cd's) have some uneven spots, this one however seems to flow all the way through the record. This seems to be a culmination of all the different styles he has played over the years. Not the driving rhythm as on 20th Century Blues, this cd seems more reminiscent of his earlier work. Highly recommended."
1,Absolute Trash (disappointed to say the least!),"Even Trower's somewhat uneven records (Back It Up comes to mind) were far better than much of the musical output of a thousand other bands. This release, however, truly demonstrates he is A. Stuck in a time warp or B. Totally bereft of new musical ideas. The vocals are horrible - why Trower feels he can (or should) contribute vocals is a mystery. The singing chores should have been left to Livingston Brown, who has the type of voice Trower's music needs and deserves. I've seen Robin play live twice with Livingston Brown, and not having Brown's lead vocals as well as better developed/more forward thinking musical material dooms this new release (in my humble opinion). To say that much more was expected is an understatement!"
3,INTO THE FUTURE,"ive been a fan for nearly thirty years since for eath below,i waited for this new cd for awhile since someday blues, i a little disappointed with the new cd because i thought robin would bring his style of music somewhat into the year 2000.maybe a second or third listen will change my mind,but i exepted a great cd"
4,great card game,Friends introduced us to this game and we love it.A bit pricey but the hours of entertainment we gain from it makes it worth it to us.We love Settlers of Catan but were getting tired of playing the same game over/over again and the above game doesn't travel well. This card game is just as fun as Settlers (although completely different) and we like that it's cards and it travels well....highly recommend it.
3,Didn't work so well for us.,I actually bought this for my 70lb mutt but found that I could not get a good fit due to his build (he has a very deep chest like a sight hound). I put it on my 80 pound retriever and it fit very well. The first walk she wore it it was amazing. Anytime she would start to put pressure on the leash she would immediately slow down. Unfortunately I have not been able to replicate that on our many walks since then. I have tried readjusting the leash but it seems to have little to no affect on her now. Having never used a harness on my dogs before I do find it easy to put on and take off and she doesn't mind it at all. I have continued to use it for her weekend hikes because I like how it keeps the leash from getting tangled as easily as with a collar.
4,great little book case,I love this bookcase. it's just the right size for the kid and it rids of some clutter. the only downside is that the taller books on the top shelf have a tendency to occasionally fall forward.
2,Disappointed,"As a big fan of Union Station and O Brother, I had high expectations for this CD. Boy, was I disappointed. Most of the songs are either trite, sappy or too religious (not traditional gospel). Big, big disappointment."
2,half good,"I was disappointed with this cd. Some of the tracks are quite good in the bluegrass tradition with a bit of a modern edge. While other tracks are better described as contemporary country. In the end about half the cd, the bluegrass half, was quite good. Still, 50% is a big 'F'."
2,"more bluegrass, less country please","Like many other reviewers on this page, I heard Dan Tyminski for the first time on the ""O Brother"" soundtrack as well. I was disappointed with this recording, though, because it sounds a bit too much like pop country for my taste. I'd hoped for something that sounded bluegrassier. ""Please Dear Mommy"" I found to be overly sentimental and the God stuff is a little hard to take."
3,Interesting,"In all honesty, I really don't know what to say about this book. It was shipped in to the book store in which I work, so I decided to read it. Fantasy is not typically my favorite genre, but I found this one easy to read. The story line wavred at times, and was confusing, but the plot was well planned, in my opinion. It was very Lord-Of-The-Rings, but Paolini's words flow well, and have something about them that create a very poetic picture. I'd say this book is a fair start in his career."
2,No need to continue further,"This isn't going to be a long drawn out list of complaints.I'm gonna try to keep it short.The book was just terribly uninteresting. The only exceptions being Solembum and Angela-character wise- and the last two chapters. It wasn't this epic adventure...it was long and mostly boring. The chapters were too short. and parts of the story too clipped. And this did not strike me as original. It seemed like it was mixed up of Harry Potter, Lord of the rings, and Merlin(The BBC series). Not to mention the word ""stymied' came up enough to be annoying.So, in short. Didn't love it. Won't be reading books 2-4."
3,Mr. Paolini needs some writing classes,"The book Eragon has a great story line. But it is written in a very unadvanced way. The words make the plot obvious at times. The words are the kind a kid would get out of reading something like Lord of the Rings. There is also something else to mention. This is a complete take off on the original Star Wars trilogy. I am not going to mention how, but all you have to do is read the book and make the connections. I hope the next books in the trilogy are a little better thought out. All in all it was a great story but the writing style was that of a fifth-grader writing an essay for a school project."
5,WOW!!,"At first, I didn't understand ANYTHING in the book. I didn't know what a Urgal or Shade was, or anything like that. But as I kept reading on and on, it made me read more. Most readers won't understand the prologue. Read from the first chapter if you dont understand. Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, and Dragon Rider better watch out for Eragon."
3,Very Good Story...Great Characters and development!!,"As a young adult with great interests in the fantasy world, Eragon is quite good. I liked the beginning half of the story, the farm boy finding a dragon's egg trying to figure out what to do with it. But the second half, really envelops the reader into the mind of Eragon and goes very deeply into the magical world.The last couple of chapters felt a little similar to The Lord of the Ring series, with the war and the blood shed, i am guessing Paolini drew some influence from those books. Reading about how a battle raged kind of confused me a little. But is still got you inside the main character's train of thought.What I find very good is the history he puts into the characters, Murtagh & Brom, and the mystery he puts into the legends of ""the riders"" and Galbotorix.For a beginner in the fantasy literature, or even a modest reader like myself, I would most definitely suggest Eragon. A very good read with no disappointments."
3,The literary equivalent of prime-time TV,"As a 16 year old unpublished author, I'd first like to say that we should admire Paolini for actually writing a book. That takes time and dedication, no matter how bad your writing style may be.Now, as for the book itself. Is it Literature? No. Is it the ""greatest thing ever wretten!"" as some (apparently six year old) reviewers would have you believe? No. But it is entertaining, and a pleasant way to waste a few hours. It will not improve your quality of thought or give you pause to reflect on the world, and you will not keep thinking about it after you've finished, but it's not _that_ bad.It's chewing gum for the brain, but better than daytime TV. Or most TV, for that matter.The Verdict: Why not."
3,"Not bad, but not great.",Overall I thought this bought was OK. Thats about it. I agree with some of the other reviews that the action was off paced. Alot of unnecessary descripstions during inoppertune times. I will probably finish the series just to see if this young writer will develop more and how much he can improve through this series.
3,Fast moving - but very familiar,"Granted that this author is young and his writing style has not been fully developed as some other authors. I can think of some other authors who's early works are more stilted and whose plots are just as ""tired"" as this one. Also, many of parts of the book are painfully reminiscent of other authors: Tolkien, McCaffery, and possibly Lackey or McKiernan.But overall, who is to say that for a first time book that it was all bad? I think that if Mr. Paolini stays with writing that he will mature in hiw writing style and have a fruitful career. There are so few ways to deal with ""fantasy"" plots that there is going to be repetition of ideas between authors.Overall, this book was a nice diversion. A classic? No. Very few fantasy books can be categorized as classics. Is this book going to be on my top 10 list of all time? No. But is good enough that I am looking forward to his next book so I can see how he can deal with his version of this fantasy plotline."
5,Eragon is a keeper,"I hadn't read any reviews of this book before I picked it up at Costco. It just looked like the kind of book I'd read. It is a combination of Anne McCaffrey's ""Dragonriders of Pern"", Robert Jordan's ""The Wheel of Time"" series, and Tolkien's ""Lord of the Ring."" It is masterfully written and really gets the reader involved right from the start. The thing I find hard to believe is that it was written by a 19 year old! The language, descriptions, and plot are so well thought out I didn't find any of it extraneous. I eagerly await the next two volumes of this trilogy. Christopher Paolini is an author to watch for in the future!"
5,"thrilling, adventurous, and exiting. MUST READ!!!!!!!","Eragon, the one name that rings in my head. Is THE MOST exiting book i have ever read. It includes dragons, magic, action, what more could you want. I love this book so much because its not an average boring book... ITS EXITING! It gives you a vivid picture in your mind the whole time you read it. One of my favorite scenes in eragon book 1, is when eragon goes to the old dragon rider training place in the mountains and battles with aria an elf. It was so described i thought i already saw the movie. Eragon is a great fantasy book and there is NO way im not getting the next book The eldest.BrittonSorensen"
3,Interesting/entertaining but a copy-cat,"I have been reading other peoples reviews, and I agree with both the 5 stars and 1 star.I just completed listening to the 10 tape audio version while traveling with my 7 and 11 year old children. They were entranced and entertained in the car for hours.My 11-year-old was well-read enough to recognize that this book is essentially a melding of Tolkein (LOTR) and McCaffery (Dragonriders of Pern), with a tiny bit of Harry Potter thrown in. There is not much origional material here, yet the kids still found it fun.As a parent and experienced fantasy reader, I did not find it objectionable, just unorigional. The author does have literary talent and I hope as he matures he can develope his own ideas rather than recycling those of other epic fantasy writers."
3,"Good,but not great","Well this was a good book,I won't deny that, and I will read the other ones in the series when they come out, but in my opinion this book had ameturish writing and borrowed too many obvious things from other books. This book is good for young teenagers(which is what I am being at 13, but I myself prefer more serious and mature writing from fantasy novels). (...)"
4,Eragon,Held my attention. Great characters. Was checking out what grandson read - approve! We all need a little magic. Fun.
4,Great story,It is really hard to put down. I can wait to start reading the next one. Good for younger readers too
5,A Great Book,Very very good. U should really read this lots of action and also balanced training and teaching. Again u should really read this book!!!
1,This book is Auful,"This book was so over hyped it's crazy. Let me be honest with you, it was written by a 15 year old... and it READS like it was written by a 15 year old. There's nothing amazing here other than that he actually got published.The name of the book ""Eragon"" is a plagiarism by itself! Ever head the name ""Aragorn"" before? Sound similar by coincidence? The main theme of the book is the ""Dragon Riders"" So we know the kid read ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Dragonlance"" before he started. I'll not go on... there's no point. The book is bad. I'm sure when he's 40 he'll be a great writer, but that's 20 years away. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,This book deserves negative 5 stars,This book is horrible. I've seen my dog deposit more original pieces of artwork on my lawn. I don't have anything else to say.
5,My favorite book!,Don't listen to the people who are giving this 1's and 2's. This is the best book i have ever read! If you like fantasy books you definately have to read this!
2,Lacks life,"I probably would have finished this book except that it was inconvinient to do so. But from what I read, eragon doesn't really do anything wrong, but it didn't do anything new either. I can't really find anything to object to except that the book lacked life. It didn't have that spark of originality that I really want in books. If you want a good fantasy that isn't going to shock you, this is probably your best bet, but otherwise, I doubt this book would have done well if it didn't have the gimmick that it was written by a kid."
4,Wonderful Story for Kids,"I have to admit that I was a bit reluctant to read this book due to all the bad reviews I've read about it. But by granddaughter wanted to read it, so we started plugging away at the story, and I'm actually glad we did. This is a wonderful story, and even though it follows the traditional epic characteristics, it still feels fresh and unique. It's definately worth a read. By the way, if you enjoy this genre, you should really check out T.H. Ferrell's new release The Pages of Tamenara. It's amazing!"
3,Why the big fuss?,"Why has everyone hyped up this book so much? I read it and it was a decently good book, but I found many parts of it to be long and uneventful. It was creative, but nothing completely unique and out of the ordinary and super fantastic. I admire that the author is so young and such a good writer, but I don't think that this book is all that it's made up to be. I was really let down after reading it. However, I would read the next book to see what happens."
5,wow,"after reading harry potter, the lord of the rings, and watching star wars, im still finding it hard to believe that eragon can enter into the fame of all this. this book is an absolute must read if you are interested with any of the above. A fairy tale beyond compare to any other."
1,Save your money,"Wish I'd read the first review on Amazon before buying this overhyped book. I can't say it any better then he- it is an impressive effort for a teenage author, but a poor imitation of Tolkien and McCaffrey's stories. The characters are wooden, and what really gives it away is the total lack of humor and the author taking himself and his story too seriously. Read the Bartimaeus books for a refreshing contrast. It did get me thinking about what qualities separate a good book from a bad one, though... When the author has to TELL you how the characters are feeling rather than letting their actions and dialogue speak for itself, that's one sign of a poorly written tome."
1,I didn't really care.,"Okay, while I do think that Eragon has a few okay characters (Angela, the Werecat) the rest are just pathetic. Eragon can be discribed as ""Hero who instanly knows everything and is the best at sword fighting, snapping at other people, drinking whineing, and getting knocked out when someone taps him on the back of the head."" Come on, the talking dog in my little sister's picture book is tougher!Don"
1,couldn't get into it,"for the reasons others have said, I couldn't get into this book. weak dialog, ridiculously weak female characters, ripped-off plot, and I'm supposed to like it because of all the hype? I don't. I for one have nop interest in the next book whatsoever."
2,not worth it,"The book is dismally written in an irritating voice. The characters are unbelievable. The plot is very predictable (almost the same as star wars). The world has been completely lifted from Lord of the rings and in the process has lost it's detailed history and grandiose mystique. I suppose it's good trashy literature for younger children, but then, there are better books that they could be reading instead."
2,Eragon,"i thought this book was okay, because it sounded a lot like Lord of the Rings, with elves, dwarves, and names, such as Eragon to Aragorn. Brom seemed okay, but his having a white great horse was like Shadowfax, and there was a lord of horses in the book. I thought it wasn't bad, but it was just a little too similar to Lord of the Rings."
5,Flying the Skies Again,"For anyone who has flown with the ""Dragons of PERN"" this story adds to the thrill of being a dragonrider. It is written from a another perspective and deserves to be read. I have all of the PERN books and am pleased to add this marvelous story to my collection."
3,A good book- but not at all refreshing!,"For a 15 year old writer, I am impressed by his writing abilities, but not so impressed with the story he chose to write about. When writing a book you can't just throw in ""new revaltions"". You have to put in something ""new"". Just plain new. Eragon, is NOT an example of ""new"". It is combined with many other books including The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars, The Chronicles of Narnia... need I go on?So, if your looking for a book different and refreshing, this is not the one. However, if you're looking for a good fantasy book, this is recomended."
5,The FREAKENESST BESSTEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!!!!!!!!!,"The story starts off with a boy named Eragon who finds a dragon egg that hatches a saphire dragon who is the most beautiful thing Eragon has ever seen. When Eragon finds out that Raz'ac have destroyed his home and his family he is fueled my anger and revenge. He meets a story teller named Brom that later becomes his best friend who teaches him to become a Dragon Rider and to use a sword and to use magic. But when the Raz'ac kill Brom, Eragon becomes a Raz'ac hunter and trackes them down and tries to kill them, but when he meets a Shadekiller named Murtagh he learns that wars aren't easy especially when he is in it! Eragon takes to the sky and kills hundreds of urgals and finally kills Durza the leader of the Raz'ac and the urgals by using the sword that Brom gave him by stabbing Durza in the heart by useing the magic words ""Brisingr"" which penatrates Durza's mail armor and heart which kills him instently."
4,Delightful and Entrancing,"As I've read here in the reveiws nearly everyone is raving about this book. I would only add that it is wonderful, a good read, and enchanting."
5,"If you like adventure and fantasy, you will love this book.","I first read this in the Eighth Grade. I loved it then, and it has only gotten better with age. It reads well, and keeps you interested from the very first chapter. The Characters are intriguing and develop well as the story progresses. The author's description of scenery and characters is outstanding, though sometimes it does get a little long, the story line will keep you hooked up until the very end. I cannot wait to re-read Eldest, and read for the first time the last two books."
3,Eragon leaves a lot to be desired,"Eragon was a gripping but unpolished fantasy, drawing its ""influences"" from so many sources that I would almost call it plagiarism. For example, Eragon's connection with Saphira is exactly like Jakkin's with his dragons in Jane Yolen's A Sending of Dragons, a book that I much preferred. And the way Saphira speaks seems much too human for a dragon. Even the way Eragon talks to himself (italicized, of course) seems awkward on paper.Also, the way Paolini randomly inserts rough paragraph-long imagery really irritates me. He obviously has a stack of long and impressive words at his disposal but doesn't know how to apply them artistically.As I said before, a gripper. It may have been the only thing that kept me flipping pages, but now, rereading bits of it, I realize how choppy the writing style is."
2,Attack of the mutant modifiers,"I eagerly opened this book and excitedly began reading it. After a few excruciating minutes, my wife walked by quietly.""What are you reading?"" she asked curiously.""Eragon,"" I replied discouragedly.""Why do you sound depressed?"" she inquired inquiringly.""Every other word is a damned adverb or adjective,"" I replied irritatedly.""That could be a problem,"" she replied knowingly.""Yes, it IS a problem,"" I muttered angrily. ""Nobody simply DOES something in this book, they have to do it DESCRIPTIVELY. (...)""""One might say his writing is rather prolix,"" she observed sagely.""Actually, I like the word prolix and I even use it from time to time, but yes that about hits the nail on the head,"" I declared emphatically.""How much shorter would this book be if some editor hacked off all the deadwood adjectives & adverbs?"" she mused bemusedly.""Probably about 100 pages,"" I replied speculatively."
5,Eragon,I am 13 and when I read this book it was like I was right there next to Eragon in his journey. I would suggest this book to anyone who has read the Harry Potter series and liked them. It was a very fun book to read and I can not wait till the second book of this series comes out. Christopher Paolini did a great job on this book and I plan to read the books he writes in the future. Hope you like this book as much as I did.
4,Magic and Dragons and Monsters.. OH MY!,"Congratulations master Paolini on a job well done. Eragon was a well read book and very entertaining, and the way it finished leaves me standing still with my tongue hanging out for the next one. However if their is one thing you could improve on it is indeed the undeniable usage of Tolkeins material. It's just to darned close is all. I can't wait for Eldest."
4,Eragon - from an 18 yr old,"I would first like to point out that I'm not normally an avid reader of the fantasy genre, but I do occaisonally like to add one to my booklist for spice.Even not being familiar with fantasy, I was able to predict most of the plot twists and characters found in Eragon. It does blend a vast amount of fantasy into one book.However, I enjoyed the book. Even if it was simplistic, I found it entertaining enough to sit and read it non-stop until it was done. Why? I like Christopher's style. It was easy to follow and while heavy in adverbs, pleasant.I'd like to see his development as the series continues."
3,so typical its almost unique!!!,"Eragon is a good book to read when your absoultely desperate for something simple to do. the plot is so elementary, you dont have to struggle at all to follow along. there are no surprises whatsoever and is about as exciting as this review is. the characters are basic and rudimentarily developed. the whole idea is platitudinous and the layout of the story is vapid and predictable. even the sequencing is exactly what one would expect. if your in the mood for a book that follows the fantasy formula we have all come to know and hate with all our hearts, then this is the novel for you. the best thing i can say about this book is that it is well written and moves at a fast pace, so even if you find it as drab as i did, it wont take up that much of your life."
1,My 6yr old brother could write better than this!,"I am twelve years old, and have written three fantasy books. I will admit, that the first one I wrote, was based off Tolkien, and inspired by him.But this, peice of crap? It was copied from Tolkien. Pathetic! It is filled with too many pointless descriptions that come out of the blue, only to drag you away from the rocky plot. It is barely a story, mostly descriptions, and the names are all tears away from Tolkien as well.Ayra:ArwenEragon: This is /too/ obvious.And Brom is obviously molded from Gandalf.The boy, is way to unoriganal and acts like he's fourty! Everything that happens is very stereotypcial, and I had to force myself to finish it. All that happens: He gets hurt, he gets better. I could guess what was going to happen next, everything was just a cheap twist from either Star Wars or Tolkien, so in closing:DOWN WITH CRAPPY FANTASY!"
2,Some sense in the plot please?,"Terrible storyline seems to wander aimlessly from page to page. While reading Eragon, many a time I would find myself getting extremely irritated with Paolini and would have to remain calm by reminding myself that this is the work of a pre-pubescent teen. This is definitely noticeable within the cracks in his plot."
2,Lack of skill,"In my opinion, young author Paolini lacks the skill that many famous fantasy writers posses. J.R. Tolkien is a clear example. He took the elves, urgals A.K.A. Uruk-Hai and dragons from Tolkiens' well written books. Not to mention lots of other different material Paolini so rudely stole from The Lord of the Rings. If he lacks the skill of a writer he should just leave it to other people who actually have that gift. He should not steal other brialliant writers' work."
3,Dissapointing,"A friend recommended this to me, but I must confess, I wasn't really impressed. The storyline was nearly identical to ""The Lord of the Rings"" with a bit of J. K. Rowling mixed in. I found Saphira's character to be flat and lackluster to say the least. Her conversations with Eragon seemed forced and unbelievable. Overall, I felt Mr. Paolini took the classic Tolkien triology and simply changed the names a bit."
2,too predictable,"this book couldn't hold my attention. i didn't really finish it, because i just didn't care enough. everything was too predictable, one thing after another. it's all been done. if you want to read fantasy that will hold your attention, read garth nix or philip pullman"
1,Skip it!!,"Chris Paolini and Robert Stanek must be friends. They write alike, they're stories are so similar. Both heroes even eventually go off to the land of the elves. How stupid is that?"
4,An Inspiring Story,"The story of Eragon is a definite read. It begins with a normal farmer boy that finds a stone in The Spine. He finds it unusual that a perfect smooth stone should happen to fall into his possession. When he realizes that this stone will lead him into the fantasy world there is no turning back. I enjoyed this book so much because magic is such a great theme. As people we really don't know if there is a world of magic and it is fun to think of all the impossible actions that could happen. The events come in an assiduous matter, which made me want to keep turning the page."
1,I think I've read this before.,"Wow. I've never seen so much ""borrowing"" done. It's amazing!In my opinion, this should not be allowed to happen, but evidently I must be in the minority. Perhaps most people are not so well read as I and think that this book is in some way original. In my opinion, it is in no way original. There are borrowings from every major work of fantasy and most minor ones. It's really distracting as you attempt to read. This is one of the few books that I have started and could just not continue with. It was truely horrid. Wonderful beginners work, I guess and great for a seventeen year old, but why publish it?"
3,A good read!,"I am a huge fantasy novel fan. Fresh after reading the sixth book in the Harry Potter series, the twelth book in the Lemony Snicket series and the twenty-first book in the Animorphs series, I needed something to read. This book is a wonderful fantacy novel. It has elves, dwarves, dragons, new worlds, and some wonderfly fanticised other charachters. I finished the book in two days and moved onto Eldest (which, sadly, is not NEARLY as captivating as it's predicessor). I am an eleven year old so children wondering whether or not they can read this, you most likely can. A good read!"
1,horrible,"One of the worst books I have ever read. Ever! I forced myself to read it only because it was a gift, but honestly it's not worth the paper it was printed on. I wish I had those hours of my life back, I totally regret reading it.The characters are flat and have only one demension. The names are either copied from better books, impossible to pronounce or complete cheese. Through out the whole book you feel bad for the characters because the dialog is so bad.I've read better work by 14 year old class mates!"
3,Good for kids only,"I must agree with an earlier reviewer... ""If you're 10 years old or younger, you'll love this book."" My 9-year-old son loves Eragon. He read this lengthy book straight through as quickly as the school year permitted, disappearing into his room for a week. I had read it first, having found it in the ""young adult"" section at the bookstore. I'm thrilled that he loves it ""as much as Harry Potter,"" but as a 44 year old SF and Fantasy fan, I can't say I was as excited. Eragon is a first novel by a young writer and does have flaws in language, description, and plot. I'm sure Christopher's writing will improve with time.While I don't think it holds a candle to the Harry Potter series, I'm happy to have found another book that will allow my son to transition from the more simplistic fantasy books (i.e. Deltora Quest series) to the more advanced (Earthsea, Lord of the Rings...)."
2,Yet another commercialized disappointment.,"Forced dialogue, Poor characterization, and almost no emotional pull renders an otherwise good story into meaningless drivel. The glaze on my eyes didn't clear until after page 150. (Enough time to blink!) It always saddens me when good money is spent on something that is seemingly all hype and no substance."
2,Looking for a good book?,"Well, if you are, don't choose this. Choose any of the books it's based off of. From the start, this book feels like its been recycled (Even down to the names. Aragorn/Eragorn.)I bought this book after reading a number of reviews on the web and in the paper which heralded it as an amazing work of fantasy. And yet, after reading it, I was rather... put out. It's decent, yes, but its certaintly nothing new. Honnestly, I'm impressed that parts of it even made it though editing.Anyway. If you're just looking for a book to waste time with, I'd suggest a series that is less traditional. If you're looking for good Fantasy, I'd suggest a series that's, well, good fantasy. Not a rip off of it.Anyways. Yes. If you really do want to read this book, or really any other book, make sure you check with the book reviews that focus on its genera. I know that's something I'm going to do henceforth."
1,Bland.,"The kind of repetetive, banal, Tolkien-referrenced nonsense that gives fantasy a bad name. Loved by pre-teens, juveniles, and neophytes to the genre. Not a bad introduction to fantasy if you are young, but definitely uninteresting to an adult reader."
2,Mediocre - and that's being kind,"As an avid fantasy reader, I was deeply disappointed by this book. I agree with others, that there was nothing new here, everything was borrowed (stolen?) from other writers. As far as the sequel, I'll skip it. There are too many good books out there for me to waste my time reading more of this."
2,And the rave parade continues...,"No way does this book have anything worthwhile in it. I'd like to get back the hours of my life lost reading this book. As for everyone saying it'll get better in the next one - I fell for it once with Eldest, won't fall for it again. Why anyone is still reading this junk is beyond me. Both my brothers gave up on this sinking junkpile - me too."
5,Is Paolini another Tolken???,"This book is wonderful in its detail and depth of imagination. Lord of the Rings has always been my favorite trilogy and elven-type fantacy... but we shall see if the Inheritance series doesn't top it! Eragon stands alone as a fine read, but is only the introduction of characters for the adventures to come! Well done Christopher Paolini!"
5,Hey all you fantasy lovers!,"I am a huge fantasy/sci-fi reader and I have to day that out of all the books I have read: From J.K. Rowling to Tamora Pierce, from Philip Pullman to Patrica C. Wrede, from Eoin Colfer to Tainth Lee, Eragon has to be the best book I have ever read.This book is everything a fantasy lover needs, from dragons to magic, from elves to dwarves. It ends abruptly and makes you scream for more!I highly recommend Eragon to all fantasy lovers to read!"
2,not believable,"This book was a bore. It was too unbelievable and never really captured my attention. So eragon finds a dragon egg, big deal. It has an unbelievable ending to a simply bad book. ..."
1,It's horrible.,"Really, the worst thing about the book is all the cheesy dialogue; the moment the story started with ""Stop whoever is coming...or die"" I knew I was in for a roller coaster ride of cliches. His writing and descriptions aren't impressive either. Writing 101: don't start every sentence in a paragraph with a pronoun, it's obnoxious, and trying to vary that up with time indicators (i.e: while, when, at that time, at that moment, in an instant), is unimaginative and mediocre. Yes, he's 17. So what? It's not impressive for a 17 year old to write like this, it would be impressive if a 12 year old wrote like this."
5,Top fantasy,One of the greatest book I ever read. One of the greatest stories. I am waiting for the fourth part when the story is finished. Amazing written.
5,You should check out this other review,"I completely agree with this other reviewer. Her/his name is Dragon Quill and her/his review is titled 'Eragon Exposed'. I'll say again, I completely agree. The five stars is for his/her review. You should check it out, its about on the next page...I give Eragon four stars. Its not perfect, but it got me to love reading. My friends have always acted as if I'm abnormal because some of them are reding freaks and I just like video games. They begged me to read this, and now I love reading, and have read so many other books, and i owe it to Eragon.If a book is read, and its good enough to get me to LOVE reading, then it's a success...that's pretty much what Dragon Quill said....."
1,Save Your Money,"Eragon was kind of good, but mostly, I hated it. The words are too sophisticated for a kid's book, and mr paolini got most of his story from lord of the rings and harry potter. Make the right decision folks! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! Stick with harry potter and lemony snicket."
1,Rip Off,"This book was The Dragonriders, LOTR, and HArry Potter in one. Even the names arent original, the Hero of destiny: LOTR, Aragorn, Eragon, Eragon, the Elf mistresss, LOTR, Arwen, Eragon, Arya, the evil foot soldiers: LOTR: Uruks/Orcs, Eragon, Urguls: The Wizard: LOTR, Gandalf, Eragon,Brom, The evil speacalist: LOTR, Nazgul, Eragon, Rozack, LOTR: Mordor, Eragon: Morzan, the list goes on and on. The character development is the same, and the nations are exact: both have dwarves who have shut themselves from the world, and a love story between a man and an elf, shaky alliances between the evil foot soldiers and the evil empire. And the spells all resemble that of Harry Potter. This book is ok but if u want a real adventure story thats original read all of Tolkiens books."
5,"I love it, my mother loves it, my nephew loves it","There aren't that many books that three different generations and two different sexes with like, but this one does it. It is a fast paced story about the adventures a young man embarks upon after a dragon egg hatches for him and he becomes a dragon rider. This is in a land where the dragon riders once ruled the skies, but the current king, (a dragon rider himself,) turned on the others and along with a few followers killed all the riders and their dragons. If you want a book you can discuss with your older child, this is it. They won't want to wait for the second book in the installment, (which is equally good.) The movie didn't do the book justice at all"
4,Great Beginning...,It is a great beginning for a fantastically young author. He has opened his own new world from which to develop sagas and epics for years to come. It should be interesting to watch this young man develop as an author. It's nice to see quite a bit of originality as well.
1,Shameless stupidity,"Stupid, moronic, idiotic. I'm twelve. This is the stupidest fantasy I've read in a long time. You other young readers make me sick."
3,"interesting enough, but not unique.","For those who haven't read tolkien, this would be a thrilling adventure. But for those who have read the Lord of the Rings, you would find a lot of similarities in the two books, such as havingthe elves, dwarves and human races and the nature of each. Brom played almost the same role as Gandalf in the book, both having guided and taught the heros of the stories.While the theme of the book is not very original, Paolini managed to write it from the interesting view of a 15 years old. There was a lot of fun in the book and definitely had more humour than Lord of the Rings."
5,surprisingly captivating,"This story, written by a nerd (Chris, if you're reading this, I mean this as a compliment, I'm sure that you are a chess playing, C++ programming, partial-differential-equation-solving-in-your- sleep type prodigy) who is my age, is the most promising fantasy I have read in about a year or so. It lacks depth, which doesn't bother me too much, and it is very predictable, but it captivated me and kept me reading it. I got a signed copy (unknowingly) and so I had to pamper it as I read it, so as not to damage it in the slightest way (I'm a freak about treating books properly).I definitely suggest this if you like fantasy.END"
2,not original,"First, I do think that this writer did have a good writing style, wich is why he gets at least 2 stars, however, the characters, especially the main character had NO PERSONALITY!!! He was so... characterless, I actually didn't care wherther he died or not! Also this books lacks originality. If this is one of this first fantasy books you've read then you might not be as dissapointed, but this book copied soooo many other fatasy books. It could actually be a fan fiction. I was really frusterated by the fact that he got so much publicity with this book, and yet... it's nothing original or special. On the other hand, the author is a good story teller. I was never bored while reading the book, but I was deffinatly dissapointed."
4,Solid Read Overall,"I thought that this book was good overall. Sure, you can definitlely spot many similarities between Eragon and other very popular fantasy novels. But what is the problem in that? Taking an approach that has been sucessful is smart, and the book shouldn't be degraded for that. While the characters may not have been quite as personal as in books such as in the Dragonriders of Pern series, I thought that he did a decent job creating his main characters. The most important aspect of a book to me is that its plot is exciting, and makes me WANT to keep reading, and Eragon did that. The only thing I really had an issue with was the sometimes apparent predictibility of the novel (ie, he's going to be attacked right... now.)But overall, a solid book. I enjoyed reading it."
4,Enjoyable for adults too,"I often find myself reading teen literature as I work in a middle and high school. I typically don't have high expectations but, enjoy finding gems to share with my kids. This book is well written, fast moving, and is high interest. Some of the plot felt a little too familiar, think Lord of the Rings meets Harry Potter. But, most definately will be enjoyed by teens and can easily pass away an afternoon for adults too. :)"
2,I dont get it...,"I really don't get why this book is so highly praised. Yes I get that someone younger than myself wrote this book and I probably couldn't do a better job of writing it, but its NOT THAT GREAT. As everyone has been saying, it stole a bunch of ideas from other influential fantasy novels, which is fine but it poorly mooshed them all together to make a really long, dry book. Great storyline, but it could have been played up a lot more. It was too long. And it's not that I don't like long books. I love Harry Potter and the Count of Monte Cristo, but they are able to hold my attention and admiration the whole way through. This one was hard to get through. I bought the second book and still haven't read it because I'm dreading that it will be the same thing all over again. I will see the movie and hopefully that will be more exciting than the book."
1,it's not worth reading,"There are a lot of one and two star reviews about Eragon. They seem to fall into 3 categories:1. The fantasy fans who have read other fantasy books or watched fantasy movies and therefore know that Eragon is a rip-off and they are not happy about it.2. The people who know something about good writing and therefore know how badly written Eragon is and they are not happy about it.3. The people who think the book is boring and predictable and can't finish it.Personally, I didn't like it because the female characters in Eragon are a joke. Well, all the characters are, but especially the females.I think if you buy it you'll probably regret it. Take it out from the library and see what you think because it's quite possible you'll hate it."
1,It's a no-buy,"For all you review-readers out there, save yourself the money and don't get this book. As stated by so many here before, it's a rip-off of, to name a few, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Pern, Earthsea, etc. Paolini can't even make up his own language. If you look carefully at the words, they sound /strangely/ like synonyms of the word they're supposed to mean. Let me see, the word vonder for a thin, straight stick, can I say 'WAND'? Or how about thrysta for thrust... arget for silver? The word for silver in latin is argentium. GET ORIGIONAL, CP.And for those who say, ""oh, he wrote it at the age of 15!"" he didn't. He was 19.Another fact: Look at the majority of people who gave good reviews:A. They were CHILDREN. Under the age of 13.B. MOMS talking about their CHILDREN enjoying it.Again I say, save your money and buy a better book."
1,Too many rip-offs,"As noted so many times, but perhaps not adequately emphasized, Paolini has obviously received influences from Tolkein, Eddings, Brooks, and many others; although influenece may be an understatement. This could easily be an uneducated rip-off of the Lord of the Rings. The book reads very much like it, from fantasy languages, to the naming of contrived species, to a hero who seems on the path to ""an epic romance"" with the most beutiful woman in the world (who also happens to be an elf). The epic romance bit is a direct quote from the book and shows clearly the 15-year-old mind behind all this. The only bright side is that in making the main character 15, Paolini has at least created one believable character. While there is definate potential here, Paoplini needs to start writing his own story instead of butchering his predicessors'."
2,Eragon,"My first thought was how close to Lord of the Rings this was. I did enjoy the concept of the story but thought it could have been more original. Eragon (Aragorn?) to close. It was as if I were reading a distortion of LOTR, Dragon Riders of Pern, and Star Wars. I will read Eldest because I adore Saphira. She was what kept me going through it all."
2,not the best book,"This book was all very good to start with but then the main character, Eragon, and his dragon go out to kill someone. Thats not what i like. Near the end there is also a lot of fighting. I didnt like that so much. I will still read the second one to see if it gets any better..."
2,Wow,"I recieved this book for Christmas after hearing a lot about it's 19 year old author. I originally thought wow, a nineteen yearold writing fantasy awesome, but then I started reading it. WOW this is a piece of crap. I'm going to assume that Chris has read a lot of fantasy, and because of this has been influenced by the books that he has read to the point that he is lacking any original thoughts at all. The only reason I'm giving this book two stars is because he is 19 and he needs props for getting a book published (even if his family oned the publishing company) when he is so young."
2,Somewhat Lacking,"The fact that this author is young does IS amazing, however the literary work is not so impressive. Yes, it is in-depth and has the normal twists and turns of fantasy books, but it lacks the craftsmanship of better writers. I believe this author has not yet acheived the ability to create 'atmosphere' liek many others have been able to. If you are interested in a hard-core fantasy series, Robert Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' is a great one to start in. With over 9 books, its completely comprehensive; the first books being easy enought o read for all people, and the latter ones being rediculously awesome and complex. A must read."
2,"Tolkien, this is not","With Eragon, Christopher Paolini has attempted to write the next great epic fantasy of our time. He's taken all the usual ingredients; dragons, elves, dwarves, evil spirits who can't bear daylight, a fantastical new world, a wise, mysterious guide, and a young boy with a mysterious heritage, and mashed them together into a 500+ page novel. But in the end, Eragon is like so many other Tolkien-esque epic fantasies: all epic, and no magic. The story dragged on, and even when I skimmed whole chapters I couldn't make myself sit all the way through it. I've tried to read it twice now, and I've given up both times.Paolini's prose and plot aren't rotten; they just failed to grab my attention. If you haven't read a lot of epic fantasy, you'll probably like this. But for those of us who have ... this is pretty much a ""been there, done that,"" kind of story. There is nothing new under the sun, but most authors can put a twist on the same old devices and make them seem new. Paolini didn't."
2,great effort!,"Young Mr. Paolini has a bright future as a writer should he decide to take some formal instruction. While he is obviously blessed with a fertile imagination his prose are weak and descriptions need work. I am more surprised at a publisher such as Knopf for editing the work in this fashion and question whether this was a marketing experiment geared at young readers. Nonetheless, it should not be compared to the writing prowess of authors such as Rowlings or Dhal. It is just another episode of a Hercules-like adventure. A lot of fun, but I dare to see him study at college, then read him when he has a greater command of writing. Goodluck."
1,okay,okay this book was... ok. I mean who likes a book that overly describes a freakin sunset and doesnt describe a action scene literally not at all? i mean come on. plus the writing wasnt as good as i was hoping it to be. i think christopher P. needed to wait a while and let his writng improve. the plot isnt that bad but the characters needed more depth. i dont recomend buying
2,If your ages 0-13 this might be a book for you,"First up let me tell you something about myself, I enjoy every book from page start to end. No matter what the book it will always appeal to me. But when the book's over, and I think about it, thats when my actual opinion of the book comes out. The same holds true for Eragon. I loved every page of it. A day after I read it, it seemed like crap! The plot is that of every single fantasy book every written. I know there are small differences, like the fact he rides the dragon around, and that the dragon is a large part of the story, but other then that you could switch the main characters name to Frodo and you'd have Lord of the Rings. I'd suggest this book to anyone from the ages 0-13 it might appeal to you, with your small minds."
2,I agree with Ivy,"Okay. This kid can write. True. But...the incessant versions of things other than said (assured was one that irked me severely) was aggravating. And the story was SOO cliched, it was incredible. I really could barely stand it. It was just a jumble of every fantasy story you've ever read. And I don't think he ""was inspired by"" Tolkien. Get it right. He copied him."
2,A Confusing Mishmash,"Although I do give the author credit for being so young and publishing what must have been quite an undertaking, the end result is still a confusing mishmash of a fantasy story clearly written by a writer before his time. The main character expresses himself in some very illogical ways. Example: He gets ""angry"" at the blue stone he finds when it wakes him up one night. (????) If a blue stone was rolling around your bedroom, would your first reaction be anger at REM interruption or general surprise and shock? The rest is more of the same, added to an assembly of skin-deep characters and a propensity for utter, recurring, consistent, on-going, verbose adjective addiction in describing even the simplest thing."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype,"As a long-time SF&F; fan I read it with a somewhat critical eye, and was initially pleased. The harshness of Eragon's life and the details of his existence in Carvahall brought an immediacy to the story. However, as the events grew more and more fantastic, my enjoyment grew less. Paolini could have used another round of editing; one grievous instance was during Eragon and Saphira's flight through a cloudbank. As they soar through, Eragon (an ignorant farmboy who has never left his mountain village and can't read) compares the clouds to cathedrals and buttresses. A little hard to swallow.His relationship with the dragon remains fresh, but the fantasy elements grow a bit wearisome by the end."
2,"Eragon this, Eragon that, I don't see the point.","Don't get me wrong, I think its well written. And almost every modern fantasy writer draws on LOTR alot. But they have the advantage of doing it more...subtley.But even that might have been excusable if it had been a bit more interesting with a slight hint of unique style. I also agree with everyone else in that it was predicdtable. But the thing that really annoyed me? The fact that Eragon did not seem real. Even Brom seemed more realistic than the main character. And the way that Paolini kept on dropping BIG hints that Eragon was going to have this romantic love affair. That has really put me off the next book. And I wonder who the lover is going to be? A beautiful elf. My advice is to read Terry Prattchet instead who at least uses characters who seem stereo-typical but really are as unpredictable as you can get."
4,Wonderful world of Dragons and heros,"This story sucks you into it's pages. You can't help but imagine everything in full technicolor. Great book to read as a family with your children. Enjoyable to my children who are 10 and 12, as much as it was to my husband and I."
4,Eragon,I thought Eragon was an interesting book. It had a lot of fantasy. There was also a lot of mystery. My favorite part was when Eragon killed the Shade! The plot makes you want to finish the book. I higly recommend it!
5,OMG Great Book,Ok a lot of you have read the lord of the rings and all but i havent so ... anyway i thought the book was fantastic. i had gotten it out of the library and then loved it i have read it at least 3 times and same with the second eldest. i have recommended it to many of my friends and my mother.i absoulutly cannot wait until the third book. when i finished the 2nd book i was upset because it left you in such a spot but in turn i would recommend this book to everyone it is one of the greatest books i have ever read and nevermind it was written by a 17 yr. old.it deserves the complete 5 stars.
5,Calling all Fantasy lovers!!!!!,"""Sorrow breeds here."" Three words that started it all. After the death of Eragon's uncle, he sets out for revenge. Instead he begins a life of adventure, magic, and battles. Whith the help of an old storyteller and his dragon, Eragon starts his new life. Eragon must leave behind all he knows and trian to be a legendary Dragon Rider.Soon Eragon's life is more than revenge, it is saving the Empire from the cluches of King Galbatorix.Christopher Paolini has sewn together a wonderful fast- paced book. Also Paolini created characters most people can relate to. This book is for anyone who wants to be pulled into another world full of magic and adventure."
1,*sigh*,"Don't bother wasting your time reading this book if you have conveniant access to either a copy of the ""Lord of the Rings"" or perhaps ""Dragonriders of Pern"". Not only does Paolini ""borrow"" characters, theme, and overall plot from both professional works, but he practically takes them and strangulates them into his own ""retooling"". This book is just plain awful and I honestly regret ever having shelled out the cash to purchase it."
1,Ack. It stinks,"Sorry kiddies--this ain't a good book. I'm one of those people who usually can't help but finish a book I start, no matter how bad it is. I stopped reading this one. Enough said."
1,copy cat,"I think the book is to much like the lord of the rings with descriptions of people and places and i dont think its orginal at all.Its the same by having the character vunrable at the begin not nowing there true strength eg.Frodo,eragon.And also Brom and Gandalf are the same sort of character.The Elves and the dwarfs have the same description as in lord of the ring and the languages and names are the same.Also the Razac are like the ringwraiths hissing and black hooded.He also talks about the Evles coming other on ships and living in a forest that no one apart from the evles have travelled in without not coming out,that is also the same.I could sit here all day and compare both stories so iam just going to say all in all a very poor reflection of a really good story by J.R Tolkein."
2,Childish,"Don't be fooled by editors' words of ""promising writer"", ""shows maturity"", "" a new talent discovered"", etc., etc., etc. This book was written by a kid, using kid's words, and its a childish book, very simplistic. Looked to me like it was written for a ""show and tell"" homework, and a very long one at that. I do not wonder the movie was a disaster: the base was very flimsy and with no ""meat"" to fill out a coherent story. This is a kindergarten story...for toddlers."
2,Can't Even Bare to read it.....>.<,"This book is actually pretty bad.I still haven't finished it(I'm on the part where Eragon is staying at Tronjeihm) because i can't bare to read it. It has waaaay too much dialogue and Paolini doesn't describe the setting or anything enough to picture it in your mind. I've heard many excuses for this book actually being good. Today at school before I wrote this, I told my friend that i was writing a review on Eragon (he has read Eragon and Eldest and loved them). I told him that i hated the book and Paolini copied some names in the books. My friend said, ""Just because they sound almost the same, it doesn't mean he copied them."" Ok here's a little note to Matt(my friend): For one thing there were A LOT of names that Paolini copied. And second, don't you think it's KIND OF odd that they would sound almost exactly the same??? Ok, well I hope you've enjoyed my FIRST book review. And a hint of advice: DON'T GET THIS BOOK!!!"
5,poem for the writer of book,"this book is niceit smells like apple spicei want to cook it with ricedid i mention it was nice?this book was not a borei bought it from a storei want to read some morewhile sitting on the floortheres another book, and its new?i want to eat it with stew!and read it with its brother blueand keep it away with my harry potter books, because this book is comparable to HP, its interesting and FUN!"
5,So What's Your Point??,"so what if millions of customers think this book was bad?? so what if paolini did take a little help from LOTR and STAR WARS...so many authors direct their book to preceding people, that doens't make them cheaters or false. he was only 17 when he wrote this book and he deserves all of the wonderful credit for it!!!! hats offff to you mr. paolini!!"
1,eragon,i dont want to give a long essay so if you want that then read some of the other one star reviews. theyre all very accurate. ill just point out the one problem that really popped iout at me.i feel like the author had one of those fourth grade english teachers who told you nevef to use the word said and he has held onto that advice very closely. he uses any word he can think of even if he doesnt know the definition. if he cant think of a word he uses stated. sometimes people shouldnt even be stating things when he uses the word stated.also i feel like he was writing with a thesaurus next tto him and every time he came accross a smal word he looked it up and used the biggest most complicsted option without even bothering to check the full definition.in short dont read this book.
2,Couldnt Get Into It,"I bought the sample and just couldnt get into it. I felt as if the plot were too fast pacd. Eragon was here, and them he was there withim two sentanes. Didnt really enjoy it."
3,Mixed feelings...,"Wow, after all the hype of the films and my fantasy-loving friends, I was prepared to either LOVE or HATE this book. Instead...I kind of come out in the middle with a 'meh'.Paolini's writing is competent enough. And the story is an exciting adventure that follows standard tropes. But does he grow at all as a character? I don't know, I prefer for there to be some growth along the way. Eragon's the same whiny kid at the end of the story that he was at the start.Recommend it? Maybe...to someone who's not picky about their adventure stories."
2,so much like another fantasy book nothing original,"if this is for a child then it is ok. it is fun to read. but for an adult. the plot is too simple. remember jane austen wrote pride and prejudice at 16. and that was a much better book.if you are an adult, probably better off reading George RR martin's game of throne series. there is more plots and depth.Eragon is made to be a stupid boy in the book who likes comforting words. who prefers not to face reality. does that really reflect what a teenager thinks? It's been a long time since I was a teenager. but i like to hear the truth of a situation no matter how unpleasant.i give it a 2 star and probably would get a bit more as a children's book."
3,Pretty good but not original,"I enjoyed reading Paolini's ""Eragon,"" but found it a little lacking in originality. Though it was a good enough yarn (and great considering his age when he wrote it) it was amateurish. But what can you expect from a teenager. The best thing about it was that he had the dream to be a writer and write his story, he accomplished his dream and he made a bestselling author of himself. Good On You, Kid!"
4,Best For Teens,"While I agree with some of the responses from the ""1 star"" and ""5 star"" crowd the reality is that this book was written by a 15 year old and it DOES show in his writing. Nonetheless, younger, less critical readers will find this book rather enjoyable. I know I did when I was 15. Like the Harry Potter series, this is a series you are meant to start young and grow with.The story is interesting without being overly complicated, and the relationship aspects of the story keep the reader empathetic. Sometimes the language is awkward, but I see that as an addition to the tale rather than a detraction. It also makes sense for the main character, who is a young teenager, to be socially awkward when speaking with much older and more mature audiences. All in all this is a coming of age story sheathed in fantasy.Thus I give it 4 stars for ""I like it"" because when I was younger I loved the book and now that I am older I see some of the flaws that a mature author perhaps wouldn't make."
3,"Not a great book, but not that bad for a 17 year old....","It's easy to be critical of this book. A lot of it is cliche, if not openly plagiarized from other sources.That said, it's a fun read if you're looking for something light and bubblegummy."
4,If you prefer dragons over vampires...,Eragon finds a stone which ultimately results in the death of his family. The stone actually is an egg which hatches a dragon that Eragon names Sapphira. Sapphira helps Eragon develop his skills as a dragon rider. Incredible that this book was written by a fifteen year old.
3,"Weakest of the series, derivative...yet it lead me to read on more","Everything said by other reviewers is true. The plot and concepts are recycled, the main characters seem a bit too polished and perfect, yet exceedingly annoying, you can tell that the book was written by a teenager, and it all can get really frustrating...And yet despite these obvious flaws, I still managed to get engaged with the story itself. I saw promise in many of the situations and I decided to go on and read the other books. Suffice to say that the author improves in the following books, but this one is easily the weakest book of the trilogy. However, once you accept it for what it is and can overlook the flaws in your reading, you can enjoy it. It is certainly not on the LOTR level or Ursula LeGuin etc. but it is much much MUCH better than the crappy movie they made from the book."
3,"I could bear it, but seriously- PLAGIARIZE LOTR","It's pretty impressive to write a novel when your fifteen, I'll give him credit for his effort. But seriously Paolini, use your imaginations a little, try not to make your book SOOOO INCREDIBLY OBIVIOUS THAT IT'S COPYING LOTR, STAR WARS AND HARRY POTTER. For starters, come up with not-so-obivious names instead of Arya(Arwen) and Eragon(Aragorn, Dragon). secondly, don't make your magical creatures so obivious such as Urgals, elves, dwarves and shades. Thirdly, make your dialogue mature but at the same time don't struggle with its maturity, because your dialogues have the feeling that some are mature, while others sounded foolish.Magical creatures doesn't have to be Elves, Dwarves and dragons only, stretch your own imagination, find some Other more original magical creatures, I'm sure you can do it with your writing skill. but you need to improve your story-telling skill."
1,Don't bother,"There are so many other books to read that are fantastic in scope. If you value great storytelling, I suggest reading other authors, such as Garth Nix. His books are so much better than this ""book,"" and like others before me, I wonder how this was published."
2,A First Draft--Needs Revision,"The novel is ok, but I can't praise it for its originality or characters. The plot is often convenient, predictable, and obviously taken from other books. The ending does not satisfy the reader, and the lack of consistent character development becomes annoying as characters suddenly grow and then revert to earlier behaviors.I have to agree with everyone criticizing the book's writing style. I know the author is just beginning, but he needs several writing courses. His sentences lack variety and the book needs much more attention to editing.As a family published novel, the book is impressive; however, as a work in mainstream publication, the work suffers from a weak tone, bad grammar, and a standard plot."
2,Please Tell Me It Gets Better!,"I've not finished this book. I've not finished the third chapter. I've heard such great things about this book, one of my best friends went so far as to call it ""like the best book ever."" So far, I've found it well written but intensely dull. I'm willing to give it a second chance however, as long as it gets better. If its anything near as good as ""Abarat"" which I'd consider the best fantasy book of my generation, than it's going to get a lot better from this point."
5,AWESOME!!!,The best book ever?!?!!?!? kinda... though lots of things REALLY resembled parts of the Lord of the Rings. The most of it was exciting and kept u guessing. I didn't really realize that it was similar 2 Lord os the rings till i was done reading it so it doesn't resemble it THAT much. This was a non-stop thriller i couldn't put it down i finished it in # days. It's very appropriate too. I'm reading it to my 6 year old brother. I'd recomend it 4 buying and it's a great thing that you'll enjoy reading time and time again!!!1
3,Always Steal from the Best (A Positive Review),"Slice 1 lb JRR Tolkien into bite-size pieces and stir-fry in a hot wok, together with 1 cup chopped Anne McCaffrey. Add a handful of fresh Lucas-leaves and stir briefly.Serve on a bed of steamed white Joseph Campbell and garnish with 1/4 cup pickled Roddenberries in Vulcan sauce. Season with Richard Wagner to taste. Don't forget the fortune cookie at the end.You'll enjoy a tasty page-turner of a fantasy novel, but you'll be hungry again in an hour."
3,"Eragon Doesn't Hit the Mark, but Close","It is amazing that a 15 year old, now older, wrote such a long compelling story. However, it reads like a teenager wrote it at times and does not stand against the imagination of Harry Potter stories and the genius of ""Lord of the Rings"". It would have been nice to see some more originality.That said, it is a story worth reading and I definitely am hooked enough to read the Eldest book. I am hoping and optomistic to see improvement by this remarkable young writer."
5,Just amazing.,"This book is definently one to read. Although it has many similarities to Lord of the Rings, it still has its many good points. Paolini is a young writer who deeply describes the story and creates an understandable story line. People who say the following:-Paolini copied LOTR.-It is boring.-He is not consistent with the personality of the characters.NOT TRUE.He has his own writing style and I found it amazing, for such a writer in his teens. This book is awesome!! Anyone should dive into these pages of fantasy, adventure, and emotions."
5,The Best one yet,this is an amazing book for 9- 15 year olds to read im 12 and i think christfor paloni could emerge as a major new talent
3,"Too big for young readers, too young for big readers","Eragon is a good book, however it's very simplistic. Adult readers will pretty much know what's going to happen three pages in advance...This doesn't mean that the book doesn't have little surprises, it does....but the main plot is pretty much predictable...This book is probably more suited to middle school kids, but the sheer size of this story will drive off almost all potential pre-teen readers."
1,Trying not to claw my eyes out,"How people could get through the first two paragraphs is beyond me. If I want to read badly written prose that badly, I'll go online and search for amateur writers' forums. To be frank, most of those are better than this.""...and the book shows the influence of Tolkien, of course, but also Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffrey, and perhaps even Wagner in its traditional quest structure and the generally agreed-upon nature of dwarves, elves, dragons, and heroic warfare with magic swords.""The point of CREATIVE writing is to do something that hasn't already been done by EVERY OTHER fantasy writer out there. At least, that's how it always struck me. Tolkien, Brooks, and McCaffrey have influenced a load of people, most likely each other as well, and that's exactly what makes this piece utterly uncreative. Even the NAMES are uncreative, for heaven's sake.No, this is not worth $$$. Save your hard-earned money for something useful. Like coffee."
1,Childish and too unoriginal,"The amazing thing about this book was that it was written by a 15 year old. But the bad thing is that it was horrible. The charactors were so much like LOTR. I felt like this book was too slow paced and lacked action. It also had a very loose story line and lacked any epic feeling. I also felt that is was hard to love the charectors. They all(old or young) had the heart of a 15 year old. Brom,the old wise rider, lacked the wiseness that charectors such as Gandalf had. Overall I hated this book and i dont intend on reading the rest of the series."
1,This didn't even deserve one star,"I read an excerpt from this book, and I could barely get passed the first paragraph! The writing is choppy, it's full of terrible cliches and is probably one of the worst works of literature I have ever read."
5,great book for beginners in fantasy genre,"OK everyone has been comparing this book to all the other books of the past. I say that this book may not be as great as the all time bests but it is a FUN book to read. I dont care if there are some mistakes like the first review said. I just read to have fun and ENJOY the book. This is a great book for the beginners, and if your just starting up with the genre it is a great book that you will have fun raeding for a week. For experts great book just to sit down and read it when you want to be in a good mood."
1,Completely wrong,I read a previous review that said 1-star reviewers were grumbling about it being a copy of other work. I can only wonder if this person actually read the reviews. Only a few people are grumbling about that aspect of this book. The vast majority recognize Eragon for what it is: the worst book ever written. From poor plotting to horrible story telling to stupid characters this book has it all. BORING doesn't even begin to describe it.
1,I'm so embarrassed,"Before you read all the glowing reviews and buy this book, be warned: This is the start of the worst series ever printed. Not just because the author has discovered he has a virtual cash machine by claiming he wrote it when 15 or that he's milking it for every last penny it's worth but because bottom line, he doesn't write well enough to be printed in the sunday comics.How much of this do you think anyone can take? Stupid me I bought both books. I felt obligated to read them because I paid too much for the books to quit? I feel so embarrassed because I've been gushing about the books even though I never read them."
1,Cookie Cutter Fantasy Story All The Way,"Save your money and buy Harry Potter. This is a cookie cutter fantasy story all the way, offering nothing new to the genre except triteness. Bland characters, bland story--he may know how to write but this is just SO PREDICTABLE AND it borrws so heavily from Tolkien and McCaffery that is really should not have been published. Awful! Zero stars!"
1,A grave dissapointment...,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book but found it a grave dissapointment. I agree with many points made by the other reviewers who were not pleased with Eragon. I might add to those comments that JK Rowling is a good example of an author who, although extremely derivative of all fantasy novels which came before her, weaved these old ideas in a new and fresh and fun way. The characters in Eragon are stock and do not exhibit realistic development. Rather they simply fit right into new and fantastic roles given to them with the greatest of ease (ie: Eragon changing from farm boy to magic-wielding dragon rider in what seems like no time at all). I believe that Mr. Paolino could one day be a very good writer, but he needs to look at the mistakes made, both creatively and dramatically, in this first endeavour."
5,Was Truly Amazed,"Being a sci fi fan and read Lord of the Rings when I was teen, I was amazed that this young author could hold my interest for so long. I'm disappointed that I have to wait until 08/05 to get book 2. Eragon is well written especially when it was written by someone so young. People who critize this book should think first, I would like you to sit down and write out a well rehearsed book with chapters that intrigue and make you read on and on. I couldn't put the book down. Yes there are elfs and dwarves as in Lord of the Rings, but it is a truly different book, and they way he writes about Shapira, does make me wish to read more. I truly truly loved it, and I'm no teenager, being 40'sh myself, who has read thousands of books over the years, I give it 2 thumbs up. Keep up the good work, and I recommend anyone to buy this book."
1,"Borrow, don't buy",No sense buying this book. Plenty of copies of this are sitting gathering dust where kids like mine left them to rot. If you are reading this horrid book hoping it gets better in Eldest let me save the trouble by stating emphatically it doesn't.
3,from a Lord of the Rings fan,"I'm about half way through the book, and so far I think it is a total rip-off from Lord of the Rings. He took so much from it, I mean, think about it. Eragon, Aragorn. Tall, strong, dark eyebrowed, bow and arrow-clad, horse-riding male elves, and the same but beautiful, dark haired female elves. He based a language on Old Norse, as did Tolkien. The whole Lord of the Rings essence is in the book, but it's lacking his incredible originality. It is really well written, though, given that he was only 15, but still, I can't figure out how it got through the editor (if he had one). But still, it WAS a good book. I'm still more apt to criticizism though, and I'm haveing a bit of a hard time finding good things to say about the book, but I think that it's worth reading, just don't expect any great work of art."
4,"ok,but not the best","I thought eragon was a great book...untill I read the reviews.Now I (unfortunately) see that it does kinda copy the lord of the rings and the dragonriders of pern. what really bothers me is it doesn't really go fast enough and doesn't have enough exciting moments.he takes to much time to get to where he's going. on the defensive side ,I noticed with other peoples reveiws they said paolini was 17 when he wrote it , acturally he was 15 and it is a pretty good book .I don't regret buying it at all.I hope Eldest will be better."
3,"A pretty good book -- not great, though","I read this book after a friend recommended it to me. The storyline is pretty well thought out but, yes, there are a few rip-offs from the Lord of the Rings and a number of other books. However,I enjoyed the characters and thought that it was a pretty good book. The writing is sometimes repetitive but otherwise generally well written. As I said before, the book is good not great."
5,Loved It,"When I read a book... or listen to it on tape or CD (as I did with Eragon)... I'm looking for something that captures my attention and holds it. Perhaps the fact that I listened to this rather than read it made it more enjoyable, but I absolutely LOVED it. I thought it was wonderful and there were places in the story that gave me goosebumps. It kept me on the edge of my seat so to speak.I don't care if the story is similar to another. If the names are the same or the fights aren't as good. What matters to me is if I find it interesting. And this book... I found interesting. I LOVE fantasy. I love elves and dragons and dwarves. So it was a wonderful read for me."
4,Eragon,"This is a story about a mediocre farm boy who discovers a strange stone in the feared mountain range ""the Spine"". This book changed my thinking in my vocabulary. I found words i have only heard of and from context clues the meaning.This book i will recomend to young readers who would like a new vocabulary. Or someone who likes fictional plots about Dragons, Elves, and Dwarves."
1,Read the real thing instead.,"This book is distressing in the amount of attention it is getting, when from the very first page it is apparent that the author ""borrowed"" massive amounts of detail, motifs, characters, names,languages, etc. from other fantasy writers, especially Tolkien. There was not an original phrase to be found. I was willing to give the book a try and was sorely disappointed. The publishers should be ashamed of themselves as they clearly chose this book as a marketing gimmick because of the author's age and have indeed made a fortune because of this."
2,copycat,While the story kept me turning pages I kept feeling as if I where reading a poor reproduction of Robert Jordan's THE WHEEL OF TIME. Similarities range from the shape of the land on the map to the capabilities of the main character. Too many typical fantasy words crammed into every sentence give the impression of a high school writer getting carried away on a free writing exercise. Nothing special here other than the authors age...and it shows.
1,The greatest fantasy RIPOFF OF ALL-TIME!,"Experience real fantasy and talent and pick up Tolkien, Rowling, Lewis, or even Jordan.Psst! If you want a really good reason why this book needs to be shamed, watch Star Wars: A New Hope and toss in a few Fellowship ripoffs too, and you will see Mr. Paolini's entire plot structure and even devices:Voila! You get Aragorn....er Eragon. The greatest fantasy RIPOFF OF ALL-TIME!But hey, the masses don't know the difference (heck they love it) and Mr. Paolini is laughing all the way to the bank."
3,"Seems like a rip off, but still enjoyable","This book was appealing to me in many ways. I like fantasy, dragons, and any thing that has a blue cover. However, upon reading the book, I noticed alot of simalarities between this book and Star Wars. Though I had this trough my mind during the entire book, I was still able to read it with joy."
4,"Some southern girl,","Ok i gotta say Christopher's(chris) book Eragon may have given away future plots in the story but you always had to guess when they came.i mean don't you people think it's nice to know how things work?and yes you may be able to tell he was real young when wrote Eragon but for some fantasy books that i've read by 40 year old people Eragon had way way more action.and about the whole crying thing,if you acctually read the book you would understand that Eragon had alot of pain in his life and to top it all off it was all happing at the same time.First with people he loved dieing, and losing good friends for a while.come on people show some sympathy.so to conclude my review I give it a two thumbs up,Chris could have done a little better but that's what practice is for right?But if this goes against what you think DEAL WITH IT!"
1,Amateurish attempt at fantasy,"Everything from word diction to language stylistic choices, to plot and character development betray that this is a work of an amateur writer. Everything was painfully predictable, or unrealistic, or outright boring. It's a pity since the author has good ideas. He just needs to learn how to write a story."
1,Yoda is in the next book . . .,"Describe a rainstorm in 700 words or more, then continue like this for and entire novel. . .I would suggest that anyone considering reading this book just get the original or go rent the movie, it's called Star Wars. This novel followed that plot so closely that I checked the acknowlegements to see if it was intentional. I was shocked to see no mention of it at all. I was not shocked to find out Paolini's parents first published his work."
4,Never trust an editor,"This is a great fantasy story. While it does obviously trod upon the well-worn fantasy themes of Tolkien and others, that is not altogether a bad thing. Epic fantasy is a narrow niche to work in as a writer, and there is no better path in which to travel than in that of the master's.Here is some advice for ENJOYING a fantasy story:Don't overthink the book. Don't try to critique it's flaws and inconsistancies. For heaven's sake don't blame the author for using Tolkien's themes and ideas, as Tolkien is the DNA of Fantasy itself, without whom the genre would not exist. Just enjoy the story and allow yourself to be taken to another world."
2,Nothing New,"Borrows HEAVILY from other fantasy novels, most notably the Pern series by Anne McCaffrey. Nothing original, but still entertaining. I enjoyed the book, but I don't feel it deserves all the credit and publicity it has been getting."
2,Good freshman start,"This is a good book for a first attempt. I enjoyed the overall story and hope the other books get better. Nothing is really original, but it was a nice spin on the arch-types. Chris uses a LOT of flowery language, but if you look at his website that appears to be the way he talks. I was mentally distressed at his description of the village ravaged by Urgals near the beginning involving a spear in a heap. When you read it, be prepared! The battle scene in the end is a bit silly, the ""dragon armor"" doesn't make much sense and the ending is abrupt. It is clear that he wanted this to be a much longer story, but cut it short and turned it into a trilogy. Or maybe for the economic reasons, he envisioned it as a trilogy from the beginning. In any case, the book does not live up to the hype and do not believe for a second it is in the same class as Harry Potter."
3,Incredibly addictive yet incredibly cliche,"Interesting book but not very original. I think Paolini didn't realize that his book was just a giant conglomeration of a bunch of cheesy fantasy books. But, I must say it was rather ""thrilling"" and did keep me going for a while. My guess is the sophistication of his writing and plot will grow with age."
1,"Sorry, but I couldn't turn off my intelligence...","...because according to some reviewers, that's what I need to do to enjoy Eragon. Stop overanalyzing and enjoy the story, right? I could do that if the poor writing weren't so obvious. That way, I wouldn't be distracted by thinking ""oh, that's so cliche"" or ""that's really predictable"" or ""every character talks and acts the same way"". To be a good book, you need an interesting story AND decent writing. Eragon barely succeeds at the former, and completely fails at the latter."
5,Better than Harry Potter?,I have read and reread all of the Harry Potter books and then I found this book and the cover looked interesting. So I decided to read it and see if there was anything special to Eragon. I was mad when the book was finished and I can't wait for the 2nd book in the series. And was it better than Harry Potter? I think it was and not only that I think this book can compare to the Lord of the Rings series as well. This is without a doubt the best book I have ever read in my life. I can only hope that a movie will be made about it. And I will also hope it is not a movie with alot of parts missing in it...... anyways this book is flawless except that it ends way to soon.
4,"Familiar, but still good!","I loved this book, and I've read many science fiction and fantasy stories. I took off a star, just because some of it was familiar. But the writing style was refreshing, the idea original, and the story was amazing! Some of it has been seen before, and yes, I'll admit, there wasn't much action either! But, for LOTR lovers, I'll remind you of the beginning of Fellowship of the ring! I could hardly get through the first book, but once I moved on to the second, it was great!"
1,The most unoriginal piece of crap I have ever read.,"Don't waste your time. As predictable and trite as most fantasy is nowadays, Eragon is the epitome of it. It has every fantasy cliche in existence and contains absolute NO original material whatsoever. It is a frankenstein of a book, with an arm from Tokien and a torso from Goodkind. All he did was tape it all together. If you've read ANY fantasy book before, you know exactly what will happen, just replace the names with other ones. Its the most unoriginal piece of crap I have ever seen. The only reason it was published was because his parents owned a publishing company and having a kid author is a great marketing angle. If anybody else had written that book, they would have been laughed into the street."
1,The Essence of Premature Publishing- a review of Eragon,"The first thing I want to say about this book is that the cover is absolutely stunning- no, really, look at it: There is Sapphira the dragon and her awesome azure eye, beckoning to all fans of Tolkien, of fantasy...of 497-page-long novels...they're in for a nasty shock. Cliches! Useless descriptions of /lamps/! An 'ancient language' that sounds like a dying furby! A main character who is meant to be talented, kind, and courageous, but is portrayed as stupid, sentimental and ridiculously talented at everything-swordfighting, reading, magic-he attempts! Robbery of ideas from Tokien, McCaffrey and Lucas!Haste makes waste, Paolini! Wait a few more years before asking Mom and Dad to publish your crap![...]"
2,I-Be-Gone,"My 14-year old niece didn't care for this book and I should have listened to her before buying it. I'm halfway through the story and have already lost interest. This is just my opinion and I don't mean to be harsh, but I feel that if I were to take transcripts of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" and shuffle them both together, I'd get ""Eragon"". I do believe that with proper schooling, this young author will have a bright career and I hope he'll consider a re-write of this novel. I'm sure that I would have enjoyed this attempt more if the characters spoke in traditional old-english OR new-modern dialect, as I found that blending the speaking styles was distracting. I also would have preferred less repetitive conversation and more action. The first 2 chapters were good, but after that became tedious. So, I think that the book is too wordy for kids under the age of 13 and not sophisticated enough for those who are older. Sorry."
5,This is the Best Book I Have Seen and Read,"I must say, I'm impressed with Christopher Paolini. This book has kept me reading for days. It never got boring, even the parts were Brom would occasionally talk to Eragon awhile. But it was exciting and extraordinary. It took me a couple of weeks, probably 3 weeks to read, over the summer. I really enjoy it's sense of Fantasy and Action. My favortie part has to be the part were Eragon first learns Magic, and when he meets Murtagh, who accompanies Eragon thorugh the final stages of his adventure. Also, Saphira was explained really well. I can already picture the way she looked.( Even though I think it's Saphira on the front cover.) Lastly, I will say this book is an amazing work of art and Fantasy. I'm already starting Eldest, but I can't wait for the 3rd book!"
4,An inspiration,"Eragon is a highly readable, fast paced, well thought out and yes, at times a familiar story. It's a good bet that most if not all of the Previous reviewers, who are giving a poor review of ""Eragon"", strange as it may seem, haven't any published books. However Chris Paolini, has. And rightly so. Is there is an artist, musician or writer who has not been inspired by others? What is often hailed as fresh is usually code for ....well, something unreadable. While Paolini's inexperience is apparent in some places it was impressive overall. Comparing to (or accused of stealing from) Tolkien/Mcaffery/Jordan/Rowling is unfair, setting the bar way too high. Dragons, fiends, treachery, magic, adventure and mystery, all ingredients of a good fantasy. Eragon is overall well written, easy to follow, highly recommended for the young and all fantasy lovers."
2,Obviously writen by a 15 year old,"This book may have a good plot line, but by chapter three I began dreading picking this book up to read each night. I picked this book up because I am an imense Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl fan. I was very disapointed.The subject (and typically the first word) of every sentance in this book is a proper noun. Trying to keep track of the he, she, they and its quickly became annoying. Also, the author can't mention any inatomate object without giving you several long metaphores or symolies to describe it.This book reads as though it was writin by someone who has never heard of any literay devices other than symolies and metaphores and believes writing a good story means cramming as many of them into it as humanly possible. Sometimes less is more."
5,pce student review,I highly recommend the book Eragon. I found it exiting from the beginning to the end. Each chapter holds new events. I didn't think any part of this book was boring and I didn't want to put the book down. I liked this book because you don't know what is going to happen next. There are always new events like challenges and adventures. I didn't find this book boring one bit because you are always wondering what is going to happen next.
4,Reminded me of Tolkien,This was a great book. I plan to read the entire trilogy. This author takes you into a world that only a Tolkien fan could enjoy. His ability to draw a picture in the readers mind is exceptional. Then....I find out the author was a teenager and shocked and awed by this kids ability. I will continue to read his work!
2,Q&A Storytelling,"Finally finished ""the dragon book"" as my friend keeps calling it and, looking back, I cannot believe I made it all the way through.Nothing surprising happened from start to finish, plot and character entirely predictable.Characters are uniformly Good or Evil in uniformly dull ways.Every chapter is written like a Q&A.; Eragon endlessly asking questions and getting answers. The author cannot stage a dramatic exchange of dialog.Gah."
4,Good Debut,I thought this book was a good debut for a 15 year old. I'm not going to write a plot summary because Amazon and several other reviewers have already provided them. I do feel that this book had a lot of ideas copied from Star Wars IV. It was very easy to see the similaries. I like the world this author created. I enjoyed the character interplay and felt that they were well developed for the start of a series. Please understand that this is a first book. I think if you read the first book of Harry Potter then you will see that you need a starting point for the characters and then you develop them more fully in the next books. I think the author did a good job of this. I feel this is a good kids' book that could be a favorite of children for a long time.
4,A nice easy read.,"When I first read Eragon, I loved it. I could not put it down. I carried it around with me, even if it was 800 pages, just to read it on the 10 min bus ride. I was emerged in the world Christopher Paolini made and loved it. But as I got a bit older, and I started to read other fiction, I realized that this book is very similar to a lot of other fiction books. But even if this book is a bit cliché I still enjoy and recommend it to anyone.If you are in the mood for a nice easy fantasy read, this is the book for you. If you are not sure if you like fantasy and you want to try it out on an easy book, try Eragon. But if you read every fantasy book ever written, you will notice every copied story line through out the book. So if you decide that you don't mind spending 800 pages of familiar text, this book is worth your time. I enjoyed this book and I hope that you do too."
2,"Derivative, but a fun read anyway","""Derivative"" is an understatement. Almost every element of this book was taken from someplace else. The setting is Middle Earth, even down to the different varieties of orc (err...urgal). The description of magic is from Earthsea. Much of the plot is Star Wars, from the destruction of Luke's uncle's farm to the apprenticeship with Obi-wan (err....Brom), but then reverts to Middle Earth (the seige of Gondor and the killing of the Lord of the Nazgul) at the end. And of course, the dragons and dragon-riders are straight from Pern.The descriptions are unbelievably overdone, from the ""it was a dark and stormy night"" school of literature.But despite all these faults, it was a fun read! My kids loved it, and I picked it up on a day that I was home sick and couldn't put it down. I got to know and like the characters, and I'm looking forward to reading Book 2."
3,Enjoyable but too much like LOTR,I did enjoy this book. The only thing is that it's kind of like the Borg came by and assimilated LOTR and WOT and this was the result. Too bad they didn't assimilate a good thesaurus. It would've helped.
1,Throughly Disapointing,"While the first chapter clearly showed possibility, the rest of the book seems rushed - as if, having got his great idea, he didn't know where to go with it and shuffled together bits of every great fantasy book ever written. The title, even, is vertually indistinguishable from Aragorn of Lord of the Rings fame.Perhaps, if he'd spent more time thinking and ploting out the book, it would've been beter. Until that rewrite, however, avid readers of the genre should stick away for fear of disapointment."
1,HI!,"Lessee here, there's a big blue book. *read read read* Hmm, it has star wars, lotr, and even Dragon's Blood rip-offs!!!! Saphira is like an awful version of Heart's Blood.Do not read this book!"
2,Been done before.,"Don't bother to buy this book. Chances are if you like fantasy literature you've already read this book--under a different title, written by a different author. Save your money."
2,Barely Readable,"Quickly reviewed: the story is derivative, the characters are under-developed and the dialogue is wooden. Overall not a very enjoyable read but a younger reader (early teens?) may find some merit."
1,Hmmm,"This is alright for a beginner but, I hope his next book improves greatly, otherwise I will not even bother to read the third one.One thing that bugs me about this book is that the author seemed to keep changing his mind about almost everything! For instance, his dragon. She keeps almost changing shape! She's supposed to be so huge and strong but can't carry three people. She flies way up in the air one day, but the next day she can't breathe that high. It makes no sense. Its as if the author keeps switching from one story to another.I don't think it was written well."
1,"Been there, done that",I picked this book up and half way through it felt like I had read it before. After I found out it was written by a teenager I was no longer suprised by the poor dialogue. It felt very predicatable based on books I have already read. It was like Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings. I wont bother with the second book.
3,Very Good!!!,"A blue stone waits in the forest. Waiting for the right person to come and claim it but, it must choose carefully for its fate depended on the person. Soon the answer comes right into the forest: Eragon. Finding the stone he takes it home, only for it to not be a stone but an egg! Several days later the egg hatches into a beautiful blue dragon: one of whose race is nearly extinct. Named after another, the dragon is named Saphira. Eragon soon realizes that this dragon is wanted terribly by the Empire and his price of learning is the death of a very close family member. Together with the help of unlikely friends, Eragon and Saphira journey becoming one, becoming what Eragon's fate had always been: a Dragon Rider.Though most people (probably adults) say that he copied other authors, you have to admit that he has done a great job for 15 (now 19) year old. I look forward to reading the rest in the trilogy"
2,"Not bad but copied, and predictable story","When i firstly glanced over the book I've already checked out it will be a Lord of the Rings copy. The map with the semi-known names, the language of the dwarves, etc. Then I started to read. The story itself was intresting (I like fantasy so I like this kind of story...), but usually very plain and predictable. Who hadn't know that Eragon will go for a long and lifechanging journey, he will save the elf and fall in love into her slowly, Brom is well-known in the far lands, Murtagh is the son of a great evil Rider, etc.Maybe if Paolini would create some own thing, he could be good writer...Now he remains fine fan-fiction writer, they use to write copies."
3,"Good, but not spectacular","First off, I would like to say the Christopher Paolini is a very talented author, don't get me wrong. Eragon is none the less an exciting story that is captivating and very well crafted. The descriptions are vivid and real, but that also is a problem. In the story there would be a long description or a long conversation, and only 1 or 2 pages of action. The battle scenes were built up with brilliant suspense, but turned out to be anti-climatic. Anyone who has seen/read LORD OF THE RINGS will catch the influence. Overall, it is a good read, yet not anything spectacular."
4,Leugims eye,"A compelling read. Very well thought out and displayed. I will enjoy devouring the next three books. May your sword stay sharp, and your edge keen."
3,Alright,"The book had a great storyline, I felt that the way it was written could have been slightly better. Overall, I would recommend it."
1,arrrgh,"Avoid this book. It is one of the worst written fantasy books I have every read. I commented to a friend after reading it that he should avoid it as it reads like it was written by a teenage kid, only then did I find out that it actually was. This book did not deserve my hard earned money and I am annoyed at all the praise it received which seems more aimed at the authors age than the actually quality of the book. I didn't get a discount for his age so he should not be getting kind praise for this trash merely for his age."
1,Awful. TRULY terrible.,"Are all you people giving this book a five star review drunk, 11 years old or just stupid? This books is terrible. It's a cookie-cutter rehash of about a trillion other pulp fantasy novels that have been written over the last 20 years, and it's not even a very good one. Half the reviews I see trumpet how this was written by a teenager---I'd argue that's blindingly obvious, and perhaps the publisher should have kept that under wraps. This books is a disgrace. I wouldn't wipe my @$$ with it...All you kiddies writing in with 5 star reviews should go back to your D+D and Magic games and leave book reviewing to people who can actually drive cars. Pathetic."
3,"not great but a good book, liked the movie better","Great theme and characters- I had to speed read through some long boring details that would have been better left out. Why do authors think a book is not great unless it is really long? Kudo's to a Christopher Paolini writing this book,while a teenager. Yes it does ring strongly of borrowed stories and characters. But how many authors have copied vampire type themes after Twilight hit it big? Overall I enjoyed the characters and plot. A good book. I liked it better than ""Eldest"" the 2nd in the series. I really liked the movie better than the book- which is something I never ever say."
3,surprisingly good,"Been awhile since I read it, but I remember it to be surprisingly good for such a young author. I love fantasy books, and this had plenty of what I like. The writing seems a little unpolished at times, but since the author was so young, allowances can be made. For another good fantasy book, I recommend Roderick Blackwood and the Demon Stone by Ralph Rathbone. It's much better than Harry Potter and makes for some exciting fantasy reading, with upstart magicians and demons in pin-striped suits."
