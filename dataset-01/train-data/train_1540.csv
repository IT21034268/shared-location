5,Good looking comfortable shoes,My husband picked these shoes out on line when he couldn't find a similar shoe in catalogs or in the stores. I then did an internet search for the best price. Oh how I love to shop on line! We received them really fast and my husband loves the shoes. They were comfortable from day one which is what you want a shoe to be.
4,Great shoes,"Picked these up on sale at a really good price. I got 2 pair for less than the price of one pair from Macy's.Nice, comfortable, casual shoes. They don't hold up as long as a really nice shoe but will easily go a year then you just buy another pair. For the comfort it is well worth it."
4,Nice shoes,"I ordered these for my husband, who is on his feet 8 hours a day. The only thing he found is that the heels are wearing on the outsides for him. Thinks it's coming from pivoting back and forth."
3,Appearance similar but constuction different,"I've been a longtime fan of Rockport shoes. First because of quality, and second, because they were extremely lightweight. On first appearance, the present product looks very similar to what I used in the past - especially when viewed on the internet. However, when the product arrived, it was considerably heavier than past shoes I've purchased. The sole is now molded to the upper shoe, so that when the soles wear out, the shoes are basically finished. Prior Rockports were easily resoled due to how they were constructed. The present product is okay, but I will need to see and handle any further shoes before buying. I will keep this pair to see how they handle in the long run."
5,A Comfortable Dress Shoe,"These shoes were for my son, who is blind. He is very sensitive to touch (size/how the shoe is made). These are one of two dress shoes he has ever felt were truely comfortable."
5,great shoes,outstanding g shoes mouthpiece and quality . I recommend these shoes.outlastallothers perhaps not the most attractive of the lot but a verymasculine shoe
4,Good Shoes,"The is my 5th pair of rockport mens buck shoes. Consistantly good shoe. I wear to work everday. Look good, good support and I wear them down wear but not out. After life it's a good lawn and garden shoe."
3,rockport review,"Rockport Men's Margin Oxford: Comfortable, good show. but heals and sole of foot wear through. Rockport needs to improve on this."
4,comfortable shoes,Comfortable shoes. I have worn these to work a couple of times & they were great.Will definitely purchase rockports in d future
1,Sore Feet!,"The Rockport margin is a cheap shoe. I work on my feet 10-12 hours a day so great shoes are very important! I bought the Margins last year on sale for $65, now they sell for $100...what a joke? Steel shank-rock hard, thin cheap liner, cheap look. Spend the extra money on the dresport tru-walk or rockport lites, you will be soooo much happier! Also, If you need a good looking comfortable shoe look at Florsheims with comfortech. They are super comfy like, the ""REAL"" Rockports."
3,Rockport Men's MArgin Oxford,"Been a long time fan of the Rockport shoes, but it is not what it used to be. It does not have the same comfort profile as previous versions, and the Espresso color is a lot lighter than it portrayed in the picture. With a name like espresso you would expect it to be dark, but it is definitely not; and that affects where and when I can wear them."
5,Class and Comfort,"Just received these Rockports.They are the perfect balance between a good looking understated dress oxford and a more office casual style.They are also very comfortable, offering a good foundation and firm support.They fit true to size.You can't always depend upon online photos and descriptions so until you receive the item there is some question whether or not you will be satisfied.These shoes actually exceed my expectations."
2,disappointment,"First I was happy to find these shoes at this price on here. I was excited and got them in 2 day shipping but it all turned out to be a huge disappointment. Reason being the shoes appear different in the pictures here. I got the chocolate colored ones and the actual shoes are no way close to the photos they put here. They are infact shiny and cheap looking, although I have to admit they are ok for the price."
1,Not ventilate,"after one day wearing this shoe, my socks were wet of sweat... and it's not comfortable since too narrow...don't buy it, not worth the money!!!"
2,These shoes squeak!,"Although these shoes look great and feel comfortable, the soles have a distinct squeaking sound as you walk. The squeak becomes more and more pronounced as you break the shoes in. I no longer plan to wear these shoes due to the loud noise they make around my office. Needless to say I won't be buying another pair."
3,Squeaky Pair of Shoes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,"Saw lots of great reviews of this shoes so I decided to give it a try. It looks great, comfortable and didn't take too long to break in. However, those squeaky sound are HORRIBLE!! Not sure what material is the bottom of the shoes, feels like cheap plastic? Those squeaky sounds appears mostly on shiny surfaces, the shinier the squeakier. (Even on hard rubber floor pile as well) I give 3 stars for the good look, comfort and price. (Was $50 and now $90+)"
5,Pleaseed with purchase,"I was pleased with the Rockport Oxford shoes I purchased through Amazon. I was pleased with simplicity of ordering, feedback about the order, and promptness of delivery at a price that was clearly described. I plan to use Amazon for purchases in the future. Regards, Robert C. Hickerson"
4,"Husband loves these shoes, very comfortable","He wears his rockport slippers out of the house, so i got him some nicer shoes by rockport. THe cushion system is different than the slippers but they still take the impact of his heavy foot step well and are very comfortable. When i received these shoes they had a bit of a scratch on the toe but we decided to keep them that way."
2,After six months these shoes hurt my foot.,This is the second pair of Rockports I've purchased. They have a great reputation and I thought the first pair I bought were an outlier. They started hurting my feet after about a year. The shoes still looked great but something in the support broke down. The second pair had the *exact* same problem after six months. They still looked great but who wants to wear shoes that hurt?
5,"Good quality, comfort and style",The style was ordered to meet personal preference for every day wear to the office and informal to formal evenings. Result was exactly what I wanted. Shoe fits perfectly and is very comfortable.
4,Excelent quality,"Soft and lightweight shoe quality, I made a good buy and I hope to continue doing a lot more on amazon, all I've done are great .."
4,Good shoe,I am happy with the comfort of thses shoes. The sizing was correct and the quality is good. The soft brown leather will accept stains and dirt but seems to clean back off ok. Very good casual choice for jeans and a nice shirt. Good shoe for the price.
2,Disappointment,"This record is/was a MAJOR disappointment. It's far too late in the 80's-revival game to release an album full of childish, cliche hooks and ideas. It's also a disappointment because The Bravery have talent and a really good guitar player. Almost every song on here sounds the same, and each revolve around very simple, obvious melodies. It just feels too... packaged. There are some standout tracks, like ""Honest Mistake"", ""Tyrant"", ""Out of Line"", and ""Unconditional"". Other than that, each track just oozes with mediocrity. If vocalist Sam Endicott learns to shake his Robert Smith/Martin Gore impersonations, and the band tries to write ""original"" music, then we might have a good album on our hands... this, however, is not it."
3,Nothing new here,They would like to make you believe this is new and fresh but really it is more of the same. It would be better if the singer didn't sound like the killer's singer with all that false emotion. It makes me a little ill. But the beats and distorted synths are kind of cool so that is why I gave it a 3.
4,Get over it.,"First of all, the new new wave sound everybody feels guilty about liking (and therfore has to be an apologist) happens to be good music. It's better than the drivel we had to sit through a few years ago, when Fred Durst hijacked my tv and radio, and Kid Rock had a bbq in my backyard.And it's not like you don't have other stuff to occupy your time with (such as Queens of the Stone Age, Foo Fighters, Rilo Kiley, Pinback...) There's good popular rock music out there being made, so why be bitter about it?Anyway, the Bravery made the best pop album of the year. And they're good looking, and put on a great live show. Period."
4,The Bravery dubut album is good....,"Well, I just love how critics and some music fans, just love comparing bands to one another and how possibly one ripped-off the other. Now, the Bravery being compared to the Strokes...what? They both might be ""hippsters,"" which is cool for us youngsters, cause we don't really want to see geezers. But where are the similarities? Anywase, the bravery dubut album is good and I like this ""new hippster trend"" or whatever you critics like to label it now a days. It's called youth, baby."
2,Blatant Killers rip-off,"First off, An Honest Mistake is unfortunately the best song on this CD. Sometimes you buy a CD, and the single is just a harbinger of things to come. Not the case with The Bravery. The Ring Song is something a 10 year old could probably write in...well....10 minutes. Likewise with several other songs on this CD as well. Their whole image makeover from ska to new wave for the sole purpose of commercial success is nauseating at best, unconscionable at worst. To make matters worse, the lead singer just sounds too damn whiny."
1,Beware,Complete Rubish. Please do not buy this. There should be copies in the bargin bin for 1.00 soon.
1,the sh***ery,"absolute trash. i was tempted to throw it out the window after hearing the lyric ""stop, drop, and roll...you're on fire."" even if you can get past the HORRENDOUS lyrics, the rest rest of the songs are mediocre at their best. to compare them to the likes of depeche mode, interpol, or the cure would be an insult to those bands. save yourself the disappointment and get yourself the real deal."
3,"3-1/2 stars -- Hey, remember the '80s?","These days it seems like retro is all the rage. One of the latest additions to the craze, the Bravery, went back to the new wave style with their self-titled album. A lot of people are comparing them to the Killers, and I don't know about THAT, but I'll at least say that this is a good album in its own right.Things start out fine with the catchy tracks ""An Honest Mistake"", ""No Brakes"" and possibly ""Fearless"". But after that it seems like every OTHER song is good. You'll be sure to run into missteps like ""Give In"", ""Public Service Announcement"" and ""Unconditional"".I'm not saying there's one bad song for every good song; I just think the aforementioned songs could use a little work. But most albums aren't perfect, so feel free to check out the Bravery anyway.Anthony Rupert"
4,Better Than The Killers!,"Alot of people have been comparing The Bravery to The Killers, but I must say that The Bravery is a better CD to buy. I have both The Killers and The Bravery, and 'Hot Fuss' just doesn't cut it... it all sounds the same. 'The Bravery' however has varied instruments and beats. It's much better than 'Hot Fuss'. Also, I compared to two bands live, and sure enough The Bravery was much better. I think they will have much more success than The Killers if people have a brain!|it's like a swollen summer, what if i'm getting dumber|"
4,"Say what you will, but this is catchy stuff","This album is far more catchy than 'Hot Fuss' by The Killers, for instance.I can't stop listening to it.My favourites are 'Unconditional' and 'Give In'Way to go The Bravery!"
4,good start!,"The album is near flawless, but not quit flawless. Just needs more catchy lyrics and jamming guitar parts. All 3 singles are amazing! Buy this album now they are better than the killers. I bought the killers album and compared and the bravery are a better band."
2,Not too thrilled,"I wouldn't say that this album sucks, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it. I liked An Honest Mistake, which I had heard on the radio,but that's about it. Save some cash and get something else."
1,Save your money & buy the single.,"That's pretty much it. There are a few good tracks on this album. But, I really only like ""Honest Mistake."" If you can pick up a single or find this song elsewhere, do youself a favor & don't waste your money on the full album."
3,Good to Excellent,"Since they don't have 3 1/2 stars, I'll just say it is Good to Great. First off, yes. This is not a band that has unconvered anything new. This is not Sonic Youth circa Daydream Nation. Second, yes, there are times that it sounds like a band produced by Duran Duran, but, NO, it does not sound like The Killers. As a matter of fact, after listening to both albums, The Bravery is far better than the Killers. Listen to this album for what it is, a great rock synth moody album."
3,Could be better but not bad......,"Lets face it, ""an honest mistake"" is the best track on this CD. I would put it up for one of the best songs of the year. Its that good! I wouldn't say this is one of those cd's that you buy based on one song, and then get home and find out the rest of its average. But its close. Yes there are some other decent songs on here. But they all pretty much have the same ""disco/80's sythesizer"" sound to them. (if that makes any sense). And yes, the Bravery do have that same, Strokes, Killers, VHS or Beta, sound to them. I wouldn't say they are that original sounding. But few bands are anymore. I can say if you like this kind of music. You won't be disappointed with them. Its still good music, and I would say buy it if you can get it cheaper than $11."
3,Exquisite Rock Product,"Bravery certainly has bounce per ounce on their debut disc. ""An Honest Mistake"" rocks maliciously, ""Sometimes I forget I'm still awake; I f*** up & say these things out loud."" As rock product, Bravery are exquisitely produced by Sam Endicott. ""Fearless"" has churning lead guitar, ""This is what it's all about, take me in & eat me out."" The weakness of the band is that the material has an absence of melody with lyrics that leave little suggestion or emotional wallop other than something to verbalize to the incessant beat, ""I'm stingy with words, all binge, no purge; you put the broke in broken hearted; you put the art in retarted."" The video on ""Unconditional"" has lots of falling dominos and minor explosions with what is probably the best track on the set as Endicott sings, ""I just want love."" This is great party music, but as art it's a bit vapid. Enjoy, but don't think about it! Or just dust off the Cars..."
4,derivative but very good,"So their sound isn't original, but if you grew up in the late '80s I think you will agree that these guys have done a great job picking up with that sound. plenty of hooks, some amusing lyrics, and basically it's hard not to like this album."
3,"If it wasn't for terrible mastering, it could have been good","I can only listen to this CD through my car's crappy system. For home listening, it's hard to make it more than 30 seconds into track 2. It is recorded/mastered way too hot, there's no dynamics at all."
5,Great CD synthrock at its best,"This CD is a great addition to anyone's CD library, especially if you're into this particular brand of rock. If you like the Killers, chances are, you'll like the Bravery even more."
3,The Cure revisited,"Although this is a new band, they sound suspiciously like The Cure. This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you like familiar sounds. The songs are short and the whole disk is over before you realize it started."
1,Yuck,"Trying to look like the clash trying to sound like joy division and the smiths. nothing new about this band, you want some fresh, new london punk sounds listen to the libertines."
4,Very Good,"There are alot of popular bands out there that compete with The Bravery like The Killers, The White Stripes, and The Strokes just to name a few The Bravery does a good job fitting in there. The album starts out great with An Honest Mistake, No Brakes, and Fearless then gets better with Unconditional and ends good with Rites of Spring. I would get this Cd its great for any Music collection"
3,Timid Bravery,"It's like the 80's all over again, when any band with a skinny tie and a good sense of make-up could get a record deal. You know, lots of jittery synths and nervous energy. The Bravery seems to fit into that category. Their debut, while containing some interesting songs, is so derivative that one suspects that there wasn't a heck of a lot of gestation between their formation and their debut. Take the first single, ""An Honest Mistake."" The opening closely mimics Duran Duran's ""Planet Earth,"" the melody follows the B-Movie hit ""Nowhere Girl"" and the overall sound parallels New Order.Granted, there are a couple of interesting other songs here. ""Unconditional"" ""Fearless"" and ""Rites Of Spring"" show promise, but there is also dreadful filler like ""Public Service Announcement."" Unless they can prove themselves to be capable of more than clever mimicry, then The Bravery won't be much more than a new century's version of Flock Of Seagulls."
2,Not as good as the hype,"I bought this because I liked ""An Honest Mistake,"" and my local radio station recommended it. I was disappointed. It really just isn't a very good album. As William Merrill said, an ""overall lack of distinguishable songwriting."""
3,Rocking with Rickenbackers,"This seems to me a somewhat lackluster, RIAA/MTV-focused offering, but the talent is certainly there, and there are some good tracks...honest mistake is one of the best top forty songs I've heard since the Cardigans way back in the day, but I'm an old punk who avoids radio.The coolest aspect of this band to any discerning ear is that the bass player uses a Rickenbacker. To those wondering, it's a brand of bass that has a very unique sort of hard buzzy sound, made famous by the likes of Yes (before they sucked,) the Who, and others better than most. The Bravery guy plays it pretty damn well, too; no Entwhistle, but damn well. Being able to hear largely bass-driven tunes with a Rickenbacker is a rare experience and worth the ten bucks to me, but a lot of people could care less.Also, on Conan, the lead guy had a devilock."
2,*sigh*,"well, when i first heard the bravery, i was surprised at how catchy their song ""unconditional"" was. and then i heard a few others, such as ""an honest mistake"" and ""no brakes."" so i excited to get my hands on this cd when it came out. unfortunately, it's not as good as i had anticipated.first of all, every song sounds the same to me. the first listen through was just enough for me. i couldn't get myself to listen to it again, only if i wanted to listen to the singles. it had no power over me. the lyrics and music are not up to par as some of the newer bands, especially The Killers, (which, by the way, has one of the most original and best sounds, but this reveiw isn't about The Killers, it's about the bravery) Franz Ferdinand, etc. anyways, all in all, this cd is good if you only listen to it once."
4,Solid Album,"The best songs here are certainly ""An Honest Mistake"". It's hard to find the right words to define how I much I like this album. It's full of 80's inspired energy. There are alot of popular bands out there that compete with The Bravery like The Killers. I bought this cd on a whim and was very pleased with it. The Bravery perfectly blend straight-up rock with synthpop to create a really good sound. Tracks like ""Fearless"" and ""No Brakes"" are also worth noting. The rest of the cd impressed me and I seriously listen to it almost everyday. I consider myself a fan of bands like New Order, Depeche Mode, Barbarian Lovers and especially The Cure so when I listen to Sam Endicott sing I hear tinges of Robert Smith. The Bravery may ride the 80s-retro wave, but that doesn't make them junk. They are a good band, and one of the best I've heard all year."
2,Honest Mistake is the only great song...,"Don't buy this CD because you like Honest Mistake, because none of the other tracks come close to living up to it. A lot of the other tracks seem like they're not even from the same band. Instead of the slow determined deep voice used to sing Honest Mistake, most of the other songs have a high-pitched annoying voice.The best songs are the first four tracks. Everything after that sucks. They do that to confuse people, because when you listen to a CD and after four tracks the songs are still pretty good, you think the CD is pretty good. Then when the songs get worse you just think you haven't been paying attention. Also since you'll want to listen to Honest Mistake a lot, you'll hear the songs right after more often, which means less listening to the bad tracks. In the end, it boils down to the fact that there are four good songs on this CD and that's it.I'd reccomend getting the first four tracks individually rather than buying the whole CD."
4,Shameless fun! One of 2005's best alternative pop rock albums! - 4.5 stars,"The Bravery's self-titled debut isn't a lyrically or musically deep album, but boy is it fun! Every track here is extremely entertaining even if it is just mindless fun. You're guaranteed to have half of these songs stuck in your head after it's all over. There are some songs here, though, which are noticably ""better"" than others (The single ""An Honest Mistake"", for example), but the rest are good too. The songs do sound a little ""of the times"" so I don't think I could consider it a classic (they're kind of generic really, but there's so many good ones that that doesn't really matter. I also don't think the singer is for everyone which hurts the rating a bit). However, unless you absolutely hate The Killers-esque rock you will probably really like this album. One of my favorite albums from 2005 and I would definitely recommend it!Highlights include:the whole album!"
1,Zzzzzz,"oh look, another new trendy disco beat ""lets bring the 80s back"" band. I'm getting tired of this phase in music, very tired. First the Killers, then Franz Ferdinand, now this. Another indie-pop 80s wannabe band that I'm gonna add to my ""hopefully they'll break up"" list.if you like the indie pop rock stuff, then listen to the GOOD bands, not this garbage, check out these bands,The Arcade FireBloc PartyInterpolBritish Sea Power...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead"
3,"Decent, but way to many f*words","When I read a book, I can generally handle occasional cursing without a problem, but in this book it seemed like the f-word is one of the author's favorite words.Because of the constant swearing, and the multiple plot holes and unbelievable circumstances, I would not recommend this book to anyone that has something else they could be reading."
2,Mostly fluff,"Finder certainly has a smooth writing style which pulls you along - and you really don't mind being pulled along because it's all good fun. However, the further I got in the book the more disappointing the story line itself became. There's a twist at the end which I found entertaining, but ultimately disappointing in a sort of ""that's it?"" feeling. Don't think I'll read any more of his books."
4,Paid $2.99 at Walmart. Good investment,"Walmart had it on the shelf at $2.99 so I picked it up. Pretty good stuff for $2.99. Story about a witty young man in corporate espionage is always good (not as good as prison break stories. read ""Dirty White Boys"" by Stephen Hunter)Not worth the hard cover but paperback even at $7.99 is not a bad deal for this book. Pick it up."
1,Outright waste of time,"This book was a total let down. Not only did it take me more than 1/2 way through to really get into the main character and story, but the ending was a complete let down."
1,Gross Profanity,I was intrigued by the story but stopped reading this book because there was too much profanity which became progressively worse.
1,Why buy it? Amazon can just delete it at any time,"Why would anyone buy a Kindle book from Amazon when Amazon has made it VERY clear from their recent '1984' and 'Animal Farm' debacle that they reserve the right to completely delete your purchase at any time? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the point of buying something is to make it YOURS, so that you can do with it whatever you please, not to borrow it for a brief period of time until the person who loaned it to you feels like arbitrarily taking it back. What a terrible idea! Down with Kindle, and down with Amazon!It is my hope that by posting these comments, Amazon will come under pressure to reveal its Digital Restriction Management policy, as well as how its DRM software works. Furthermore, I hope they will discontinue their policy of remotely deleting and/or crippling books that have been purchased. This is America, Amazon. We don't believe in Memory Holes!"
2,Whole is less than sum of its parts,"First of all, kudos to the author and publisher for providing this book for free via Kindle. While I wasn't overwhelmed by it, I did find it to be an entertaining read.The novel's plot is interesting and engaging, and it's obvious that Finder has done his homework ... he seems to have thought through a lot of the potential pitfalls and plot holes. I'm not in the tech industry, but I found much of what he described to be plausible.The problem with the novel is with the characterization. I wish Finder had devoted more of his attention to who his characters were and what made them that way, and how best to show us those characters. If this were a film--and it would make a fun film!--the burden of characterization would fall on the actors. As it is, it just falls. It's the difference between telling and showing. Showing is just plain more effective.That said, I liked the novel well enough to read another by this author."
2,Disappointing end,"I read this free Kindle download and loved the writing style and engrossing story. I was feeling so lucky that a free download was so good, until I reached the end. The surprise ending did not feel legitimate; the finely drawn characters turned out to be shams, and we are not sure whether the main character learns anything. Very dissatisfying."
4,Quite enjoyable!,This book really kept me interested. I was definitely caught off guard by the ending. I would read more by Joseph Finder!
4,Mystery & Suspense in the Corporate world!,Delightfully entertaining! You know it's well written when you become emotionally invested in the characters. There's no reason to pass this one up. It is both suspenseful and a fast read.
1,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to this book as it was billed as a corporate thriller. It was horribly written, almost like a 5th grader is trying to pass off as a adult. The premise is sort of intriguing but in the hands of this author was stultifyingly boring. It's a shame that he couldn't put together a decent read with this premise."
5,What a Surprise,"What a wonderful surprise this book was. And FREE?I had never heard of Joseph Finder before downloading this great read to my new Kindle 2, but he is now right up at the top of my ""must read"" authors.Thank you Mr. Finder, and thank you amazon.com for helping make it so easy to find this wonderful surprise.:)"
1,Descriptive writing?,"I had high hopes for this book, but I, too, was very disappointed. I did manage to struggle through til the end, although I did begin to ""skim"" especially through all the room, office, people, etc descriptions....Oh my GOSH!! I liked the overall story line, but was extremely disappointed in the writing -- very amateur. Could have easily been condensed into a not so 'wordy' book and been just as effective. I also agree that dropping the F-bomb and other foul or degrading language (ta-ta's? are you kidding me?) only degraded the book further. Sorry, but I certainly would not recommend this one."
2,Did not like the main character (Adam),"First you think he's a slacker. Then you think he's an idiot. Then at the end he turns into a self-righteous snob. What.. Everyone can play the game, except for you, Adam? Ahhh... your feelings got hurt.. poor baby.I just did not like the main character, and that turned me off of this book. For a very similar story (but with a likable main character) I would suggest The Associate, by John Grisham."
4,A nice change from the tiresome lawyer/detective/cia genre,"This is a great book for anyone who likes a good corporate espionage story, and I highly recommend it. I personally enjoyed the opportunity to read a mystery/thriller which did not involve a lawyer, a police detective, or a secret agent. The adversaries here are corporations, and the players are highly trained and highly paid corporate spies and counter-spies. I'd like to see more like it."
1,Duped,"All the five-star reviews convinced me to try this one, but I was very let down. I found the book too shallow to enjoy. The writing kept jabbing me with its cliches and tight imagery, and I got bored. After finishing, I felt like I'd spent the evening watching sitcoms or something."
3,Paranoia was just OK for me,"If you have nothing else available to read, this Joseph Finder may appeal to you."
2,A disappointment,"I was looking forward to reading this thriller about corporate espionage. Despite a good story idea, however, Finder's execution fell short of my expectations. First, the plot is thoroughly implausible. At far too many points, the protagonist's choices simply make no sense. Second, after a long, drawn-out, almost tedious build-up, the book ends unsatisfactorily, leaving too many loose ends. It is as if Finder couldn't figure out how to wrap things up and just decided not to bother. Third, the characters were under-developed and entirely forgettable. It is difficult to like or relate to any of them, including the protagonist. Finally, the writing is pedestrian, lacking the richness and vigor that might have made a marginal book a pleasure to read.In sum, though I forced myself to hang in there all the way to the end, I wish I had spent my time reading something else. I've given the book 2 stars, but I would have rated it 1-1/2 stars if that were an option."
3,"It was an okay book, read it.","Joseph Finder's (oddly mis-titled) PARANOIA was not nearly as bad as anyone on these boards claims. I've read MUCH worse novels, even some Stephen King novels. (Such as CELL. Chriminy, how did that get written?)This is no Michael Robotham or Scott Turow, let's be clear, but it is a better novel than ANYTHING written by the following authors:David BaldacciPatricia CornwellSue GraftonJames PattersonJeffery DeaverJohn GrishamDan BrownNo kidding here, folks. PARANOIA was enjoyable and has a terrific surprise ending. I recommend it. I wouldn't recommend the book if it was a bad novel, trust me."
4,Engaging,"I happened to get this book for free for my kindle on Amazon. That information aside, this book will keep your mind occupied for its duration. Definitely escapist fiction. Good vacation reading."
2,An Inspiration to Aspiring Authors,"This story goes from one implausible event to another, leading the remarkably unsympathetic protagonist in a juvenile and predictable rags-to-riches/zero-to-hero story. Along the way the reader is brought in to a world of supposedly high-tech corporate culture about which the author apparently has even more ignorance than he has contempt. The characters are shallow, the plot is unengaging, and the first-person narrative makes reading it like living inside the head of a very dull person.If drivel like this can get published and so well reviewed, it should give confidence to every aspiring writer out there, no matter how bad."
4,No Cherry on the Sundae??,"Paranoia had all the elemets to be a classic suspense novel--interesting characters, a believable plot, even a believable love interest. Just when it was getting real interesting with a seemingly inescapable end game, our hero was had. It was as if the writer ran out of energy. Surely a plot line could have continued with a more death or law defying ending, a bigger more complicated double cross on Wyatt. Instead it ended with a HUH?. With a better ending Adam could have been a continued Hero left to fight and get into more scrapes again elsewhere. The world needs more Robin Hoods."
3,A good story line,"I decided to try Paranoia since it was a free download and wanted something to start reading on the Kindle. I immediately was hooked on it and found myself unable to put it down. His details in describing people and places made me feel like I was part of the main character's (Adam) world. I was disappointed with the use of language which didn't add anything to the story or realism. In fact, at times it even took away from the story. Otherwise, it was a good story line and suspenseful. I was disappointed with the ending. After the great story line and build up the ending let me down.I am willing to try one of Finder's other books if they are written in the same suspenseful manner. I liked his use of fictitious and real companies and their products. I would hope that they aren't written with all of the language to try and shock the reader or create some sort of realism."
2,Horrible writing,"From the second i picked up this book and read the first page that was jam packed with clichés i was disgusted. However, since i was on vacation and had nothing to do I forced myself to read the novel. I was extremely annoyed by the writing which was terrible and just about dropped the f bomb every other sentence. The writing was not sophisticated in the least. The ending was interesting and I think that the plot of this story was ok. Moreover, the word vomit that appeared on the page was difficult to stomach."
4,Great Thriller,I really enjoyed reading this book. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I really didn't see the ending coming (at least the last part). I love spy novels and corporate espionage combined with high tech corporations makes for the perfect scenario.
3,A mind twister,This kept me guessing the whole novel. Liked what i read and would read another by this author. Will recommend to others
4,"If Grisham Came from the Corporate World, This Would be His Book","Finder's novel has the same feeling of suspense that you'd get from any of John Grisham's legal thrillers.The Firm: A NovelWhat I like about this book is the corporate setting and how Finder portrays executives as liars and cheats, in ways that are authentic. Great characters, plotting and pace but I wish Finder found (sorry for the pun)a better ending for the story."
3,Not what I expected,"I found this a bit of a departure from Mr. Finder's other books, and I've now read all but one. This one was a bit more slow paced and ""mental"" than the others. The end is what left me scratching my head. Not sure how I would like it to end, but I can't say I'm thrilled with what happened for some reason. Of course, I guess Adam did the right thing, but it rather left me out in the cold somehow.So of all this author's books I've read (only one left) I believe this was my least favorite. Perhaps it's the subject matter. I've just found others to be better reading."
4,Paranoia,"I not sure why, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. Paranoia is the story of a young man who gets pulled into a game of corporate espionage after getting caught doing some creative accounting. His money-hungry and self-absorbed boss sets him up to be trained to infiltrate and steel trade secrets from their primary competitor. After setting out on his mission Adam becomes conflicted about his misison. He's come to admire his new boss and can't help but see the contrast between how he was treated previously and how he's listened to and recognized in his new role. He is torn between the choice of completing what he set out to do and crush the man he has come to admire, or turn against his old boss and spend some significant time in prison."
1,Reads like a first draft,"Paranoia reads like a first draft -- lacks polish and development, character, richness of setting. The result is a bland walk through the life of a jaded protagonist. There is fodder for a good tale here, though in this packaged it's severely underdeveloped. Like other reviewers, I found myself skimming faster and faster as I moved through the book, very disappointed in the overall experience.Normally, I'd simply stop reading, and wouldn't give much time to writing in about books I don't enjoy. In this case, there appears to be a more systemic problem: The notion of the free download for the Kindle is suspect. That this book has been propelled to the top of the downloads list naturally is bunk, and further illustrates for me that the best sellers list is likely contaminated with publisher kickbacks."
5,Corporate Espionage,"Gut gripping, well written story of corporate espionage in high stakes corporations. Characters with long knives that would outdo Machiavelli. Could happen and probably does happen in many workplaces in today's business world. First book I have read of Joseph Finder and I intend to read more of his novels. Very well done!"
2,Makes the Patterson Boys Look Like Hemingway,"This is a 4-star plot burdened by 1-star writing. Other few-star reviews have already pointed out the weaknesses of the writing, and i concur. I would actually get angry as i read, seeing such a fabulous plot idea wasted away. Wait for the movie."
1,A Very Shallow Book,This book was soo predictable. The twists were mere curves and the plot could have been shortened to two chapters.A real shame. I was looking forward to this book....
1,Whoa.,"I was shocked when I started reading this book. I wasn't expecting brilliant literature out of a crime novel, but I thought for the first several pages that the author was starting the book in farce mode, making fun of the genre, and I was laughing along with him (or so I thought) at how absurdly poor the writing was, cliches, cheap voice, hollow characters, etc. But then I realized it was actually the book. Whoa. Kind of made my skin crawl. Then I continued in pure fascination as the monstrosity unfolded. I actually got worried about myself wondering if I was indulging some type of masochistic behavior so I stopped. Was it just me?"
3,Big Disappointment--Not remotely realistic,"I had high hopes for this book. I read the first few pages, loved the dry, witty writing, and thought I was in for a good ride.Maybe the problem is that I work in the high tech industry as a recruiter, and from the very beginning, things that just would never in a million years happen ruined the story for me.It could have been so much better, but was just too over the top. First off, how could someone embezzle close to 80k and not realize, that A, it was that much money? and B, that there would be some problems? Stealing does usually result in jail!Then, Product managers, individual contributors, at Adam's level, don't make 175k.Add in all of his 'save the day' last minute discoveries, and I couldn't help groaning, especially at his ease in breaking into the office...just silly.Clearly the book was written to be a movie.It's too bad though because I think this author has talent, and is capable of much more."
3,its ok,"This book started off and tugged at my heart strings for what the character did for another. Was it wrong? Sure. Would I have done it? I don't know. But, of I had and had to go to security and give my reason for it; I would have wanted it to go like this guy had it in giving his story and making the man behind the desk sweat. I laughed and held on as this story took me through some twists and turns. There were times when I wasn't sure, but in the end it was an ok read. It's a book about corporate espionage that entwines some thrilling and even laughable scenes."
4,Difficult to put down,"Paranoia is a fast-paced, enjoyable read from the very beginning. There is action, excitement, intrigue, and frequent plot twists. In the story itself, underachiever Adam Cassidy finds himself presented with an offer that he cannot refuse. Adam quickly is in the middle of a complicated industrial espionage scheme between two high-tech companies. As the story unfolds and the pressure increases, Adam is increasingly conflicted.....clearly in a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situation. Although some of the action is predictable, confusion, uncertainty, and surprise is the general rule, thus driving the reader to want to read ""just one more chapter."" Character development is strong, adding significantly to the plot and subplots. Although not as good as Finder's ""High Crimes,"" I strongly recommend Paranoia. It should prove to be an entertaining read."
3,Corporate espionage with a surprise ending,"Tightly drawn characters and a careful plot really help a book about an inherently boring subject: corporate spying. I usually figure out the endings of these things, but this one took me by surprise. Great airplane reading."
3,An entertaining thriller,"Adam Cassidy works for Wyatt Telecom when he makes the mistake of impersonating the VP for Corporate Events and ordering a sumptuous farewell dinner at Meals of Splendor for the retirement party of a loading dock employee called Jonesie. Subsequently, the management accuses Adam of hacking into proprietary company databases in order to obtain confidential disbursement numbers, of stealing 78 000 dollars from the Corporate Events account and of both wire and mail fraud, all of which could result in a prison sentence of 35 years and a fine of one million dollars. But then Nicholas Wyatt comes up with ""a generous offer"", a ""special project"" consisting in taking a job at a rival company called Trion Systems. Adam has no choice but to accept. ""And my life as I knew it was over."" he will later reflect when remembering these early events before being entangled in a web of deceit and conspiracy."
3,Left me scratching my head,"This book was so good until he started trying to wrap things up. It was like he gave up trying to write and just ended it. The ending was so far-fetched, it ruined the book. He has a new book out and I am not risking wasting my time again."
5,Great mystery novel,I have read tons of business thrillers. This one I could not put down. It was like the show 24. Never a dull moment. I loaned it to my daughter who is 25 and she loved it.
4,suspense thriller,"This book grab's hold of you right from the start, and does not let go.Corporate shananigan's abound!"
5,FICTION AT ITS VERY BEST!!!!!,"I do not read much fiction. But I have to tell you, after reading Paranoia I will be much more inclined to reading more (especially anything written by Mr. Finder). Outstanding character development, superb story-line and very easy to read. This book has everything: corporate spying, a slight love triangle and LOTS of twists and turns. The reader is kept on edge, which is great -- a real page turner!!!! My wife and I both loved it -- in fact she just bought every book written by Joseph Finder. Try it, you'll love it!!!!!!!"
1,Tennessee reader,Very disappointing. Way to technical for my taste. The writer surely did his research on techno babble but the story left me wanting .....
1,Complete and utter trash!,"I downloaded the book because of all the positive reviews. However, I couldn't even get through the first chapter with all the bad language. I don't particularly want to hear F-this and F-that--there is enough of that crude language around that I am not going to deliberately expose myself to more of it. I could care less about the story line, characters or any other part of the story unless the language is cleaned up. I deleted it off my kindle and am reading something else now! Complete trash!"
2,My my,"I've got to side with the one and two star crew on this baby. The writing was so slick I slipped right off on page 40 - I enjoy a good comic thriller, but this one lacked metal. All gloss, no grip. I recommend Extreme Denial instead."
4,Great Read,This is my second novel by Joseph Finder. Killer Instinct was my first and Paranoia was even better than expected. Unexpected ending and it flowed nicely. Looking forward to reading more of his novels.
1,Not good,"The other reviewers who gave this book one and two starts had it right. Adam is not believable at all. Once he crosses over to the other company and gets a great apt to live in with a great view, he suddenly turns into someone with all kinds of insight into other people. The characters are one-dimensional and cliched and it's WAY too wordy. The author threw a little bit of everything in there - corporate espionage, poor kid makes it big, sex, humor, sick parent,cranky old man, washed up inventors, secrets, lies, etc etc etc.... too much.The ending was so bad that it made me angry. I invested a fair amount of time reading this book on my iPod touch and when I read the ending, I couldn't believe it. I'm wondering if there was more that it didn't download!! The ending was one of the worst I've read ---ever.I'm sorry to those who love the book. I don't get why you do, but then, you probably don't get why I don't love it, either!"
4,Corporate Espionage,"Joseph Finder quickly pulls the reader into the suspense with Paranoia, which dives into the action with Adam Cassidy being immediately immersed in a serious situation: His employer, Wyatt Telecom, catches him in the act of manipulating company funds to help out a coworker. His employers use this to their advantage, forcing Adam to infiltrate the ranks of a competitor, Trion, to get the details on a hot new technological product.I had trouble in the beginning relating to the protagonist, Adam Cassidy, finding him a little too nonchalant and cold hearted. However, as the story progressed I found myself cheering for him. It's a good read and a good look at corporate espionage."
3,Grippingly Light,"Just finished reading this book. Many of the higher rated reviews claim it gripping and hard to put down, which is true. It was very entertaining and not at all difficult on the brain. And many of the lower rated reviews claim that it's characters are unrealistic and stereotypical, and it's plot formulaic and cliche-ridden. I agree with that assessment as well.I can't say that the book gave me a wealth of insight, nor can I say that I believed in or am giving a 2nd thought for the characters now that I've put down the book. Can I tell you that in a couple of months I'll remember that I even read it? Not sure. But for about a week, when I had the time to pick up Paranoia, I enjoyed it in the same way I dig the very occasional brainless contemporary Hollywood film.It was entertainingly ridiculous- a moderate recommendation."
1,Only If,"If you like to read the same basic thriller that's been published so many times before, if you enjoy generic obvious humor, if you want nothing fresh or out of the ordinary, if you believe in supporting things that have been designed only to make money--this might be for you. Otherwise, you might be as sickened and disappointed as I was."
3,If you like swearing...,"I really liked the book. Sure it was a little unbelivable but that is what fiction is, right? Unfortunately, with all the swearing in the book I really can't reccomend it."
1,OMG what the heck is it????,"well not sure what i thought it would be, but it certainly doesnt do anything as anticiapted."
3,not fond of communal living,"good story , but i dont like that with all that money , Hope have to live with her monther in law and sister in law, and have to go to their room to talk , so that his mother and sister will not hear them . yuk ,brought me back to reality, and this supposed to be a fantasy .too much with the inlaws things for me, even with the traditon stuff , gave it 3 star, it is still a good plot afterall"
3,Not Her Best,"I have enjoyed most of Lucy Monroe's HP novels, but this is not her best. Although there are many things to recommend the novel, I felt that Monroe tried to do too much. This plot encompasses nearly all of the category romance crutches--forced marriage, betrayal, misunderstanding, the stock ""other man"" and ""other woman,"" and, oh, yeah, let's throw in a pregnancy as well. I felt like too many plot twists took away from what I really wanted to see--the development of the relationship between the two leads. I love the heroine; she balances just the right amount of innocence and spiritedness. The hero is indeed an alpha, but I felt his character kind of fell apart toward the end of the novel. And although I like my alphas to have to grovel a bit, I don't like them to become haggard with remorse. All in all, this was an okay read."
1,Causes I-phone to keep stopping,"I had hoped to use this with my i-phone, but it doesn't work. The music tracks repeatedly pause when attached to the adapter. Since it works fine when not attached to the adapter, I can only assume it is the adapter."
4,One of his better Xmas collections,"Windham Hill pianist Jim Brickman hits the keys with a mellow yet powerful grace that is equally satisfying as a party background disc or an attentive listen. For vocals, Anne Cochran's 'Do You Hear What I Hear' adds a dynamic twist that stays with the instrumentals yet drives them a bit as well."
5,Another holiday winner from Jim Brickman,"We now have several wonderful Jim Brickman Christmas CD's, and this one is equally enjoyable. Very nice background music."
5,Expected the best...got the best.,"Once again, Jim Brickman has given us an album that will soon become a staple for Holiday Music. He has captured the nostalgic holiday spirit that lives in all of us, but because of the hustle of life, doesn't always come out. While listening to this CD, I was reminded of my childhood and warmed by the cozy thoughts of a dark room with only the Christmas light glow from the tree and crackle of the fire...while outside it was snowing and cold. You won't be disappointed with this purchase! Some tracks have guest vocals and each song evokes a feeling that will take you to the core of Holiday Spirit. I hope you enjoy this as much as we are...Happy Holidays!"
2,Too Long & too irrelevant.,"As you can see this book has a lot of pages but most of the story in these pages are just fillers. They are long and irrelevant to the main story and at a certain point makes you stop caring about the story altogether. The main premise is interesting...it's about Lois and Clark's marriage being on the rocks. Superman tries his best to accomodate to her feelings or at least what he perceives to be her feelings. While this story can be told in a limited number of issues, DC comics opts to spread it over other mini-stories that are much less interesting. The end result is you get a mediocre collection of Superman stories."
5,Awesome book for Full Size Chevy Trucks,"If you are doing any driveline mods, lifting, or off-roading this is the book for you."
5,"Great Price, Great Quality",When I started searching for Speakon cables I was finding high prices for short length cables and some of them were only 16 gauge. When I came open these cables I was happy to see that they were 12 gauge wires with a 30 foot length. I took a chance and purchased them hoping that they wouldn't be too low of quality. I got them and was surprised at how well they were made and have been using them every day for over a month now and they are GREAT. Since then I have purchased 2 more and will continue to buy this brand since they are (THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK!!)
1,Poor quality,Picked these up for a new system - used them 3 times had to repair them twice - It delayed gigs and nearly spoiled the show. Save your money.
5,Good book,"I already had the book, enjoyed it so much that I wanted to give another copy to another person. Thanks for the speedy delivery Barb"
5,It works!,"Not much else I can say. It seems to work well. We had some problems getting our Gamecube to see it, but I think that's because we bought a used Gamecube... It's working now."
4,It works,"Wnated to play some games that needed a memory card, and this was what I chose. Cheap but fully effective. Have not lost any data over the last year of moderate use."
1,Wrong Item Shipped,i bought the aforementioned 16mb memory card for my gamecube and what was shipped out was a 16 mb white WII memory card. made strictly for wii. that would've been fine if it was compatible for both but it was not.now i am stuck with a wii memory card. :(
2,Not Durable at all!!,"I bought this for my nephew last christmas. It went together easy enough, but it came apart after every car went down the track. He got a kick out of the speaker device(that lasted a week before it broke). He also got a kick out of having the cars land in the cel at the end of the ramp. I gues it would be fun if it actually stayed together longer than thirty seconds."
3,Okay- But wouldn't waist time.,"My 4 yr old son wanted this toy so bad for his birthday that I did everything I could to make sure he got it, now I wish I'd found something else. He plays with it but it falls apart to easy. The track does not stay together at all and the radio quit working only after a couple of months. For a child that likes to play rough I do not reccomend. It was fun for the 1st day then after that it now collects dust."
3,Funkadelic,"This song is SO groovy! I just love playing this on the car stereo. These guys are so cool. Them and 98 Degrees, I cant decide whose better. I hope there album comes out soon."
5,Loving Miranda and Outstanding Historical Western Romance,"I read about a book a day and this is one if the best romantic westerns that I have read in quite a while. The characters of Miranda and Ben have both been scared on the outside and inside, but each, with love help to bring a healing that neither excepted to have in their life.As with most series, this book gives us time with people that we loved and hated from the previous novel, but this books extends their story and weaves their love together with the new romance.I was sad to finish this book, but it will have a place on my limited book shelve so that I can visit with these wonderful charaters again. Where the heck to all of the guys like Thad and Ben hang out!"
3,Miranda's Family,"Miranda's trip to Ft. Victory to help her sister during her pregnancy was not what she expected. Ben Lancing appears on the scene to collect a loan his dead brother owes him. The problem is that Miranda's family is living on the farm. Another problem arises when Miranda captures his attention. Ben just wants to get his money and leave. Miranda wants to help her sister's family keep their home. The sparks fly and their relationship ignites. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
5,"wonderful, touching","Loving Miranda is a book to fall in love with. Miranda is a touching heroine with a heartbreaking past and Benjamin Lansing a hero who needs her. When they finally realize their love for each other, it's a satisfying end to a wonderful story of love and redemption."
3,Disappointed,"I had really been looking forward to the Opera Babes new release. Unfortunately, it's quite disappointing. If you want music to fall asleep to, this would fit the bill. Except for Bailero which is so distorted from the original Canteloube, to be unrecognizable. The voices are still beautiful, but the album is quite uninspiring."
2,Opera Babes-Renaissance,I am sorry to say that I was extremely disappointed in the new album by the Opera Babes. I had really been looking forward to it's release but I had a hard time relating this to their first really great album. It is almost like a different group.
2,custom fit is bull$*! t,Durable material yes color matches good but fit is all off spend more money on weather tech to get a better product
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This is a strange book. The sequel novel ties in partly to the movie, with some of the characters, but pretty much sticks with the backstory and other information found in the Guns of Navarone.As such, it is a bit on the problematic side, and definitely not anywhere as tense, exciting or well done."
3,Average,"I thought the original was a better book, this book seems to me to leaven on the first one too much. Overall it is a fine effort from the author, it keeps up a good pace and the facts are correct. If I had it over again I probably would have not read it and moved on to something else."
4,A sequel as good as the first,"This is a great sequel to ""The Guns of Navarone"". Our threee original heros are back and better than ever. This book has everything, suspense,intrigue, and a nice twist at the end. If you like Maclean, you'll love this book. Defintely one of his best works."
2,not quite there yet,"This all in one promises a lot: scanning, coping, and printing. However this printer suffers from the same problem that many current printers have:1. It cannot print evelopes correctly. Only 1 in 3 attempts are printed correctly.2. You cannot scan pictures into email unless you are using Outlook.3. The print quality is so/so.4. It uses a lot of disk space.You're better off waiting until the technology is perfected (which for item 1, may be never!)"
1,I am on my 3rd printer and counting.,"This printer is a (not good). I (...) used it 3 times and then the printer stopped working. I called (the manufacturer), sent that one back only to get another printer even more messed up than the 1st one. The whole top of it was cracked. Called them again...they sent another one out which is still (not good). So now I am going to send this one back hoping they'll send me something that works!!"
4,great for home and great price,"I have had this all-in-one for about two years. it was tricky to install at first b/c I use OS X, but its been very reliable since. Sometimes it seems like the printer has suddenly been uninstalled butall you have to do is run the set-up wizard again. its not hard. I think its a wonderful little machine. i like to make personalized cards and special wrapping paper with all of its functions, as well as printing out reports."
2,"Works well, just don't lose the power cable or you're hosed","We really liked this printer/scanner/copier, but at one point the power cable got stripped & had to be discarded. We have been unable to use any other printer's power cable on this model, because HP built it such that you have to use the one that came with the printer (and that one only). Other cables won't even be able to get into where the opening is."
2,Tendency to break,"We use our printer for customers who occasionally come by to print. Everytime we turned it on, it kept on giving some error about replacing the ink. We bought brand new ink and it would still give us the error. We tried restarting it and we used its self-clean feature, and every once in a while it would work and then it would pop back up with the error message. I am so tired of trying to figure out what is wrong with it."
4,"Great Product, Ok software","What surprised me was that this product was easy to use. The software took a while to install and to make it work. When I got it working, it prints real smoothly and the quality is great! It is definitely worth the money."
5,Love it!,I love the way the fruit rehydrates in the milk in my breakfast cereal. Absolutely delicious.
5,This is THE Night Rider Book to Get,"This is a history of the Night Rider movement - an outgrowth of the Black Patch Tobacco Wars in Western Kentucky from 1905 to 1912 ot so. It's a fascinating piece of American History - the tobacco farmer versus the American Tobacco Company, which is becoming a monopoly in the world of tobacco. Well researched with details of the principals, and the major raids. I also read Marshall's Violence in the Black Patch of Kentucky and Tennessee. The Cunningham book is FAR AND AWAY the better book."
5,Best Avalanache Safety Video,"This is a video that will enlighten you but more than that, it will move you. You can not watch without realizing that human life is at risk.No other video has as many esteemed experts with real world experience. This is just the best."
5,Excellent Book,"I started backcountry skiing (Cat) with professionally certified guides a couple of years ago. I have read a couple of avalanche and backcountry books, as well as watched one video. This is the finest book yet. I now understand what the guides were doing and the reasons for the instructions they gave us. This is a clear and well organized guide to avalanche awareness. I like how the material is reinforced with examples. I especially like the action plans on what to look for and avoid, and the ""Ten commandments"" section. I feel that this book will help me the next time I am in the backcountry."
3,Good for practioners or stretching with a partner,"Others have already noted, that too much of this book has content that you can only do with a partner. If you exercise on your own, look elsewhere."
3,adequate but lackluster book on stretching,"Well illustrated and well organized book but rather dull, lacking in advanced concepts and understanding of stretching, and lacking in a high level of technical accuracy. Would recommend books such as Stretching Scientifically by Thomas Kurz for attaining very high levels of flexibility quickly and safely and Autostretching or both volumes of Muscle Stretching in Manual Therapy by Evjenth & Hamberg for greater precision, accuracy, thoroughness, etc. Information such as ascribing Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation to Holt is totally inaccurate (it was developed by Kabat along with input by Knott and Voss). Not a bad book for the general public but it's not a book that a knowledgeable exercise professional such as an orthopaedic physical therapist would want to spend $30.00 on."
1,WRONG ONE,"THIS IS NOT THE STORM WITH KEVIN CHALFANT. I made the mistake of buying this album, thinking it had Kevin Chalfant and the songs ""In The Raw"", ""I've Got A Lot To Learn About Love"" and ""Show Me The Way"". This is an entirely different band with a female lead singer. I've also written the seller of this CD and told them about the mistake in their advertisement. I didn't get ANY response and I'm stuck with a Storm CD I never wanted. BE SURE TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT THE PICTURES. They list the songs on the album correctly."
2,Nisey,"These shoes ran extremely small. I ordered them for my daughter to wear under her prom dress. She normally wears a size 11 but because of the way these shoes are made, she actually needed a size 14."
4,I Can't Believe I'm Reading This Stuff!,"I started reading this and rather enjoyed Simon Kirby-Jones, the witty American author residing in an English village, before I realized he was a vampire. Then I thought, ""I can't believe I'm reading a mystery about a gay vampire who solves village mysteries!""A main plot line was rather cliched, in that the famous decorator was obnoxious, cruel and hated by virtually all who came in contact with him. (Hmmm. I wonder who's going to be murdered here . . ."") But the writing and characters were entertaining enough to overcome the cliche and there were enough surprises to keep me going.Okay, I don't believe this, but I'm looking for more in the Simon-Jones series - even tho I feel silly reading about a gay vampire. Just don't tell anyone, ok?"
2,Boring,"I enjoy Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire Mystery series so I picked up this book. I was bored. Maybe it would have been better to start with the first book in the series, but a good book should be able to stand on its own. In this case, there was a distracting subplot about his pills and a Nemesis that was either a reference to an earlier book or preparing for a subsequent book.The main characters, particularly Simon and Giles, came off as cariactures not ""real"" people and because of that did not capture my interest or affection. The plot itself was thin. I could not wait to be done reading. Based on this book, I will not be reading any of the others in the series."
5,Family Fun - Especially For the Little Ones!,"GREAT FOR TRAVELING IN THE CAR! And fun dancing at home with too! Wendee's Animal Dance CD is loaded with upbeat songs for the whole family, especially the little ones. The tunes are easy on the ear and the lyrics fun to learn. Wendee and her CD represent good wholesome fun! There are songs with great lessons, like ""I'm Gonna Brush My Teeth...."", and ""Look Both Ways"". The kids can learn, while having lots of silly fun. My personal favorite is, ""In My Swing"" - brings back pleasant childhood memories. Close your eyes and you'll feel like you are on that swing again."
2,Too many cons to be worth it,"it's good for the small size, quiet machinery and 3 in 1 function. That's ALL. I've had it for six months, and like the person from San Francisco, CA, i've tried everything to clean the print cartridges and it still won't print correctly. It was the first scanner/fax machine I had, so I thought those two functions were okay. But the printer is NOT worth the money. I had my HP Deskjet for years, while this one only works for... 6 months only. And what people are saying about the ink price is true: you can buy a whole other printer by buying 2 ink cartridges. Also, their technical support seems to be a little iffy to me. The manual doesn't help you beyond the simple problems, and if you still need help... you're basically on your own. I won't try Lexmark again."
4,Nice printer for home use,Nice multi functional printer and very affordable for home use. I was very satisfied with it - has good quality.I would have given it a 5 star - but it takes too long to copy a page. It first scans the page and then prints it - on its on. So it takes twice the time some other all-in-ones take. But other wise its A1.
2,"I always wanted an ""all in one"" machine...","I always wanted a printer/scanner/copier machine, and this is my first one. I have had this Lexmark X75 for about 10 days now, and I like it so far. The printing seems good, though not as fast as I expected it to be. I didn't have any trouble installing it on my computer (I have Windows 98). I have noticed it seems to freeze my computer up at times, especially when I use the scan or copy function; this problem keeps me from giving it 5 stars. Overall, I think it seems like a good product for the price.I've had the machine for over 9 months now. My computer still freezes up occasionally when I use the Lexmark X75. I'm especially bothered by the poor quality of the photos I've printed out, when I compare them to ones I printed on an Epson printer I had. Plus almost any document I print has uneven print quality; I guess it would be called bands going through the page. I'm considering buying the HP 1210, but I don't know it it's much better."
1,Printer was broken when it arrived,I had to return the printer as it would not print correctly. The paper kept getting stuck because it wasn't going through the printer right.
2,A very bad buy,"I purchased this all-in-one with a firm belief in Lexmark products. The X75 really shook that believe. The print quality was so terrible that I returned my first one only to find that my second one was just as bad. The model itself just can't function well as an all-in-one. As a scanner it's great. As a copy machine it's somewhat acceptable if you make only small amounts of copies, but as a printer, it is completely unreliable and often temperamental. Ultimately, it's more trouble than it's worth."
2,You get what you pay for...,1. I found the installation very easy and user friendly2. Print quality is good to very good3. Speed is ok to goodNOW the UGLY SIDE:I tried different kinds of paper and no matter what i do every 5th or 6th page jams the printer!!! Never had that happen on my canon... the paper feed seems defective... besides that the machine is really nice. The problem is you really DO NEED THE PAPER FEEDER to work for the rest of the printer to work... Very disappointed returning mine tomorrow...
2,was disapointed in it,I purchased this printer about 3 months ago and it quit working for me. i tried to reinstalling it numerous times and it did not work. took it back to the store and bought the same one and it would not load for me. continude loading for 4 hrs. and i gave up. i wish i could have gotten it to work because i really like it when i got it...
2,Not a good printer,"I purchased this printer it worked great for about one year and a half. After that the printer crashed, it cant even print anymore. It makes a very loud grinding noise and then it locks up. This printer is not for the long run, do some research and buy something else."
1,STAY AWAY FROM LEXMARK!!,"If I could have rated this a negative 100--I would have! Stay away from this companies products! They SUCK!!!!As another poster stated, I also had an HP printer that lasted a very long time--no problems whatsoever! If Lexmark were giving their printers away--I wouldn't take one. It has not been worth the headache and on top of it, the cartridges are among the highest on the market! I've only had this piece of crap since JUNE!!! I'll be going to purchase a new HP tomorrow. THe lesson I learned from is to stick with the tried and true. I went with the LExmark because of the price--well, I got what a paid for--actually not because as far as I'm concerned it's not worth a plug nickel!"
1,Printer doesn't work!,"I bought this printer, brought it home and plugged it in but after two days and several emails to customer support, it still isn't printing. The printer carriage slams against the side of the printer everytime I try to print something and then the printer stops. I'm very unsatisfied with Lexmark. It has taken 2 days to get a return email and they don't even have an 800 customer support line. Call waiting times are listed as greater than 45 minutes so there must be a lot of people with problems!"
2,not worth my time,"I was given this printer - New In Box, etc. so I can't complain about buying it. But there is no way I'd buy one myself.1) The print quality - at any level - is noticably worse than other printers I have access to.2) The cost of cartridges is stupidly high3) The paper feed mechanism is hit-and-miss after only 1000 sheets4) Now, after 6 months, it won't print. Period. It advances the paper and moves the heads around, but nothing hits the page. And, yes, these are brand new Lexmark cartridges. A second set (I assumed the first set of new ones was bad - got a second set from a different source. Different lot numbers)5) The only thing that keeps this from being a single star review is the scanner. The scanner - while not up to snuff when compared to my dedicated HP scanner, is absolutely suitable for document scanning - either for digital records or scanning."
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought this printer 2.5 years ago b/c at the time it was way cheaper than all the combination printers. The quality when new was pretty good. The color prints are pretty good. However, the black ink goes very quickly and it can cut off a little bit of your document at the bottom. It has just now broken after 2.5 years. I tried to get tech support or servicing and I was appalled how poor Lexmark's service was. They just told me the obvious and pushed me to buy a new printer. The closest service place was 25 miles away and I live in L.A!! I don't think I will buy Lexmark again, or buy a printer just because it is cheaper."
3,Tips on Dealing with some of the Problems,"I should have read the reviews before I purchased this printer. It had such a good price. Everything was working well, the color prints were very amazing. But then It started to get these ""whitish/grey lines"" in pictures and texts. The tried cleaning the nozzels as told and it didn't work. Finally I read online that you should put the nozzel holes in warm water. I did this for a few minutes, but then, What works best is to get a teapot. Once water boils and steam comes out, put the bottom part of the ink cartidge there until and steam it you see little ""ink beads drip"". I did this and Now it prints good.Text is printed good, but I still get these ""light streaks"" in my pictures. It seems to be a common problem from what I read. Also, the yellow ink has run out quickly.Good printer, but has problems. I haven't had paper jams and I hope I don't."
5,Simple to use,"I have used a variety of scanner/copier combos, but none have seemed as easy to use as this one. I think the quality is excellent for the price. I use it to scan pictures, make stationary and invitations, and copy important papers."
2,TERRIBLE!!,"I got this printer about 10 months ago, and after the first week I had to exchange it because the paper feed would not work properly. Paper was constantly jamming. I figured it was a fluke with that particular one. Well, it wasn't. The 2nd printer I got has the exact same problems plus more problems!! I just replaced the black ink cartdridge less than a month ago, and it's already empty &amp; I don't print documents on a high volumn either. The avg. lowest price I can find for (1) blk. ink cartridge is $32.00. That's 1/2 the price of the printer itself.!!!!!Also, print quality is low at best.In my opinion....I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRINTER"
2,Not a good value!,"Little can be added to the insightful review below. The book seems to have been an exercise in computer problem-solving that someone (incorrectly) thought would make a good book. In addition to the book cited by the author below, I recommend Fred Reinfeld's 1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate (but read Renaud & Kahn's The Art of the Checkmate first!), 1001 Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations (also Reinfeld's), Lazlo Polgar's Chess, and DuMont's The Basis of Combination in Chess. The Renaud & Kahn, Reinfeld, and DuMont books are inexpensive and offer a far greater value than The Big Book of Combinations."
3,"Great organics, not the best cots for flavor","Yes I have eaten organics before, the brown color has no effect on me whatsoever........... but, these taste more like big fluffy raisins, not apricots. There's a hint of 'cot, but there is more 'cot in Apricot Pyramid Beer than these. That said, they are what they are and they are great for regularity and great to send as gifts - dried California organic fruit.I should say I am used to slab 'cots from casa de fruta, and these do not resemble in any way those dried 'cots even though they use sulfur dioxide, they are juicier and sweeter and taste like apricots. Even Casa de Fruta's basic 'cots taste better than these. I ordered on subscription, but will cancel today and have at least 4-6 gifts for Christmas already."
1,"Covered in white powdery fuzz, no expiration date","The apricots were shipped with, what looked like, specs of white powder all over them, that in a few days times turned to white fuzzy mold. Clearly these apricots were sitting in the back of a warehouse somewhere, for months (possibly longer). Amazon was great in offering an exchange. I hope my replacements will be mold-free. If so, I will alter my rating. But considering how much money I've shelled out for these, they shouldn't arrive in the horrific condition that they did.Further warning: the bags don't have any expiration dates listed, so there's no way of knowing how old they are, or when they expire."
4,When Your Back's Against the Wall,"Montana horse breeder McKinnon Quinn is in need of a horse trainer. Casey Westmoreland is the man, or in this case the woman, for the job. The attraction was indisputable and the chemistry was off the charts. So what's the problem then? Stubborn McKinnon feels that a life of bachelorhood is his destiny. Casey, on the other hand, feels differently. Will McKinnon be able to resist seduction, Westmoreland style?There's nothing more I can say that hasn't already been said about Brenda. The fact that this is book number 45 speaks for itself. Fans of the Westmoreland family will not be disappointed. Anxiously waiting on Spencer's Forbidden Passion."
5,Hot Time in Montana!,"Who would have thought of Montana as a romantic place to set a romance novel and especially a black romance novel at that? Well, Brenda Jackson one of the pioneer black romance writers has done so with this book. She is continuing her impressive line of books with Seduction, Westmoreland Style, and the latest addition in her Westmoreland books series. From the hot cover of the book to the hot romance in the book Seduction, Westmoreland Style, is an easy read with lovely descriptions of Montana weaved in for good measure. Ms. Jackson has snared her readers again into anticipating the next hot Westmoreland book with this entry. She has proven that she can only make it better with each new book she writes. Enjoy!"
3,Okay - Not Her Best,"I'm a big Brenda Jackson fan. While I enjoyed this book, it was not her best in the Westmoreland saga."
2,Rent This One From Your Library,"First off, Ms. Jackson should request a new editor at Harlequin. There were so many typos and consistancy problems in this story, it didn't make any sense and most of them were at the very beginning of the book. One minute the heroine was off the horse, two pages later she was back in the saddle.Second thing, this book should have been titled Seduction: Cliche Style. Of all of the things the author could have thought of to keep the heroine and hero apart she had to come up with one of the most obscure reasons, which only a soap opera writer could have thought of.If you must read this title rent it from the library."
4,Another great story of the Westmorelands,Brenda Jackson does not disappiont with this story even tho we know how it will end reading about Casey and McKinnon journey is well worth it. I don't know how many more there are to write but hope we hear about Casey's brothers.
2,Sliced and Diced Aquinas,"This is an unfortunate example of the sort of thing which academics produce and then force undergraduates to wade through. The author has found all the similar passages in Aquinas' many works and has collected them together in snippets varying from a paragraph to two to three pages in length. This results in great repetition, and the beauty of the sweeping logical development which is presumably present in the original, is lost.A word of warning to anyone who would approach Aquinas: read your Aristotle first."
2,Not well designed as an introduction to Acquinas.,"This book suffered from three weaknesses, the first of which may be idiosyncratic. 1. A ""reader,"" I presumed, would be an introduction to Acquinas, one I could read without attending a class. Not so. This book assumed a lot of familiarity with Acquinas's terminology and intellectual heritage. 2. The book is organized by topics, with brief excerpts from Thomas's works yanked out of context to fit the editor's topic selection. A sequential selection from Thomas's principal writings would have better preserved the integrity of the works and allowed the reader better to follow Thomas's reasoning. 3. Finally, the editor needed an editor. Her writing is cumbersome. She seems to have forgotten how to write a simple declarative sentence.I find Moses Maimonides no more approachable than Thomas Acquinas, but Isadore Twersky's ""A Maimonides Reader"" is far more approachable than Mary Clark's Acquinas reader."
5,Finally Not Afraid To Expose Who They Are,"This is the first time the Dixie Chicks were allowed to show who they are and not what Sony wanted them to be. This album is the first from their own record label and was done mostly in the comfort of a home. You can tell. Their choice of songs and instruments were tailored to them only. Not only were they unafraid of commercial critic ..., they were unafraid of scaring their fans away. The best songs on this cd are the ones people are saying are boring. ""Top of The World"" is by far the best song on the cd, the ending is gorgeous and the lyrics make you re-evaluate what you are doing with your life and the effect you have on people. ... DC's have finally come into their own, and moved into a new Home. Any one with real taste in music needs to buy this cd. On a final note, the Dixie Chicks are doing what Alison Krauss has been doing all along, making top quality music along with pure vocals."
5,Instant Classic,"I actually didn't think it was possible to top Wide Open Space, but this is a remarkable cd. Natalie Maines voice sends chills down my spine. Travlin Solider brought me to tears. This is a wonderful CD."
3,has it's moments,"HOME get's off to a flying start with bouyant LONG TIME GONE, the beautiful LANDSLIDE (even if does pale next to the original) and the stirring TRAVELING SOLDIER. Sadly the next few tracks are flat and listless. TRUTH #2 has a bland arrangement and WHITE TRASH WEDDING has barely a hook to pull you in. It feels like an excercise in how fast the chicks can play. Sadly that's the case for most of the uptempo numbers on HOME. The album wraps with GODSPEED and TOP OF THE WORLD, two tracks that rank among their best. If only the chicks could reach that level of consistancy through the entire album."
4,The Dixie Chicks Do It Again,I'm such an avid fan of theirs! they are amazing women with so much talent. great role models for anyone. and this new CD of theirs is amazing. an acoustic disc that goes strait back the their bluegrass roots. a great CD to chill out to in these winter months.
3,Disappointed in this album except for Landslide...,"and Stevie Nick's original is much better. I love the Chicks last two albums, but this album, with the exception of white trash wedding just.... You can't even groove to the music like with other country artists, or even their last two albums. Album should have been more of a ""project"" rather than a ""pop record"". So, unless you like the folkie/bluegrassy type of songs (which most of the sounds like), it's for you!"
3,Critics love these kind of records,"This is the kind of album in which critics will call the nerdy words ""Critically Acclaimed"" I don't know about anybody else but I just hate those words about an album it makes a record sound very square. Home actually is just o.k it is not like Wide Open Spaces or anything like that but it has its tracks two them in which are tired radio hits like Landslide and Long Time Gone probably half the album will wind up on the radio before next year is out. The Dixie Chicks came back very serious this time and that comes as a shock to the audience there new sound is more mature and darker then previous music. Home is very good but the Dixie Chicks should start having a little more fun on there records like the previous ones."
2,too slick&by the Numbers,"I Respect the Playing of the Dixie Chicks&there hard work,but this set seems like they were forced by Sony after almost leaving them to drop this Album.something about the direction of this album seems too slick much substance.""Landslide"" here is truly lame.it does a InJustice to Stevie Nick's Classic.the material here is just kinda there.the Playing is Good but the songs just lack any sort of edge or excitement for me overall.easy Cash in."
2,Actually 2.5,"This is the first CD of this group that I purchased...it is ok, kinda boring...Love the first song...kinda goes down hill from there...this will not play in my CD player that much...wish that i would have waited for something else to come along...but ya dont know till you try it..."
5,Top of the World,"Wow! i love the Dixie Chicks and am always impressed by what I hear. This album is no exception. It is amazing. The lyrics, the melodies, the music, i'm completely blown away by this wonderfully made album. You can tell that they really had fun on this one! I highly recommend it for anyone who really loves country music!"
4,It's OKAY,"I like the Dixie Chicks and in my opinion, this is not their best album. In fact, it's the worst of the three that they've put out. That being said, this album does have some good moments, such as Landslide and the soldier song."
3,Slower Than I Was Expecting,"I loved ""Wide Open Spaces"" and ""Fly"" so much because so many of the songs were upbeat and rockin' - country style. I just loved songs like ""Some Days You Gotta Dance,"" ""Let `Er Rip"" and ""Sin Wagon!"" The Dixie Chicks have really slowed it down for ""Home.""The songs are powerful, and the lyrics heartfelt, but with eight entire slow songs without a killer banjo solo to be heard, I found myself nodding off. Of course the three short up-tempo tracks, ""Lil' Jack Slade,"" ""White Trash Wedding,"" and ""Troubled Tortured Hearts"" are awesome, but not quite worth the price of admission for me.If you like the Chicks' slow stuff from their previous albums, by all means, get this CD!But I have to agree with a previous reviewer who said: ""I'll take the `Sin Wagon' any day and `FLY' far from `HOME'!"""
5,"A long time coming, but well worth the wait...","One of the things I love most about the Chicks is their versatility, both in the songs they choose and the way they sign them. ""Home"" is a wonderful addition to their first two albums. Once again, they have a wide range of songs, from more bluegrass sounds of ""Truth #2"", to their take on Stevie Nicks' ""Changes"". Added in is a little fun that can be found in ""White Trash Wedding"" and a little sorrow in ""Traveling Solider"". The great combo of songs makes this the best Chicks album yet. If you are a fan of the Dixie Chicks or country music in general, this is one album you don not want to miss"
5,Amazing Artistry,"I believe the Dixie Chicks just keep getting better. Natalie's vocals sound even more beautiful and powerful on this album and Emily and Martie's harmonies are gorgeous and more on display on this album than the previous two, probably due to the focus on vocals and instrumentals and lack of drums on this album. While this album is different from Wide Open Spaces and Fly, like both of those, I can listen to Home all the way through without feeling the urge to skip tracks. They showcase more of their bluegrass roots on Home, and even when they play bluegrass they rock! The Chicks definitely still rule! Favorite tracks are ""Long Time Gone"", ""Truth No. 2"", ""White Trash Wedding"", ""A Home"", ""More Love"", and ""I Believe in Love""."
5,The Chicks are Back!,"This has to be the best Dixie Chicks album yet! It definitely has a &quot;homey&quot; sound to it with the banjos and dobros coming across much clearer than in previous albums. Unlike earlier rumors, this is not a completely bluegrass album - although some songs do have a bluegrass flair. I am not the biggest fan of bluegrass, but when the chicks do it, I absolutely love it.With so much freedom in making Home, the Chicks have definitely redefined themselves, but the end result will make any true fan happy."
3,Good but could be a little better!,"This album has a different sound than what we are used to from the Chicks. The highly accustic sound is still there, however, Natilie's voice takes on a different sound after the first two tracks. The songs are mixed upbeat and mellow. There is quite a bit lacking in the orginality and good quailty of music. This is not like their other two albums at all! They only wrote three songs on the ablum and they don't have the same spunk as the first two albums do. They have Emmy Lou Harris sing on track eleven but she can't be heard only if you listen real close. I really am dissapointed in this album. I was truely expecting better from them."
2,"Not What I Expected, Chicks!","Recently I've been really getting into country music. As a 15-year-old girl from outside of Philly who listens to Mariah Carey, Ashanti, DMX, Nelly, and Britney Spears, I thought it'd be a good idea to expand my musical horizons. After buying and LOVING 'Breathe' and 'Cry' from Faith Hill, and Shania's 'Up!', I hurried to buy 'Home' from the Dixie Chicks. However, I was terribly disappointed. I guess I'd say it's just too bluegrass for me...I really like the rockish sounds of Faith and Shania. Aside from ""Long Time Gone"", ""Landslide"", and ""Travelin' Soldier"", 'Home' has little else to offer."
2,'FLY' Was Better...,"Well, when I first put this disc into my player, I was expecting the same sounds as FLY. Nope. This album is not very good. It's not like the fun,bouncy, and party-like country hits on their last album. I would have to say the only songs I like are 'Landslide', and 'White Trash Wedding'. I highly anticipated this album and was highly disappointed. Well, 'HOME' is going to be in my next yard sale."
5,A very pleasent third offering!!!,"All I have to say is this disc is still on my CD player at home....thinkin' 'bout pickin' one up for the truck, and the office, then I won't have to fool around movin' it from place to place!!!!!!!"
5,Brilliant,"I'm not a big country fan, and don't remember the last time I bought a country CD. However, the Dixie Chicks bring a refreshing, and boundary-crossing twist to country music. The first song I heard, or actually saw the video for was ""Long Time Gone."" Their songs just have a rhythm that makes you want to dance along with them. Their version of ""Landslide"" by Stevie Nicks is what made me buy this CD. I love and respect Stevie Nicks and her talents, and for someone to re-do her song in a just as fabulous way, is very impressive to me. A great CD."
3,Doesn't Live Up To Previous Work,"The Chicks' third major-label disc is a direct departure from the sound of their first two Sony albums, and I'm not sure it's for the better. The stripped-down instrumentation works on some of the songs, particularly 'Long Time Gone','Travelin'Soldier',and 'Tortured,Tangled Hearts'. But those(like me) who loved the Chicks' rowdy sense of humor on past hits like 'Goodbye Earl' and 'If I Fall You're Going Down With Me' are going to be disappointed with much of the low-key, barebones material here. And the presence of 'White Trash Wedding' is hardly a tonic--the previous 'Earl' did have that novelty feel too it, granted, but it also carried some strong emotional reaction. 'Wedding' is just pure novelty, almost for novelty's sake, and it simply doesn't work. Ultimately, in comparison to their previous two albums, this one is a far harder pill to swallow."
4,The Dixie Chicks Great New Album!!,"Home - This is a great new album from the much loved Dixie Chicks! Wide Open Spaces is still my favorite of their 3 albums. But this is still a really good album. Travelin' Soldier made me cry when I first heard it - wonderful story. I love Long Time Gone because they mention my home State of Indiana!! White Trash Wedding makes me think of Goodbye Earl - it reflects the sense of humor and fun The Dixie Chicks have with their songs!! And Lil' Jack Slade is a great bluegrass piece - makes you dance, even if you're in a seat!! Those are just some of the songs I'm enjoying on ""Home"". So yeah, I recommend this album, the Dixie Chicks rock and even though I'm not a huge country fan, I love the sound they produce!!"
4,the best of Dixie Chicks,"The musics and the lyrics where very refreshing. Sometimes, only one or two tracks are great. This is one of the few that each song is just as good"
4,Great if you're a fan...,"The Counting Crows have never been known for putting out new songs as B-Sides to their singles, but this one is obviously an exception. Baby, I'm A Big Star Now is indeed a brand new non-album track, and it is actually quite good. If you found yourself disappointed by the lack of upbeat material on This Desert Life, this is the exact song for you... and if you're a fan, you will not be disappointed. The live version of Omaha, however, is nothing to write home about, just a nice little live song that was previously available on August And Everything After, and thus makes this single less attractive to me. In the end, you should get this single only if you already own and love This Desert Life (and if you don't own it yet, I highly advise that you pick it up). If you're looking for great live songs, however, you'll probably do better with Hanginaround pt.1"
1,"This adapter is only for HP Photosmart models 618, 912","According the the back of the box, this adapter is only for HP Photosmart models 618, 912. Of course, I only found this out after buying it to use it with a Photosmart 315 model, which it doesn't fit!"
4,Compelling personal and court drama.,"This has been the most compelling crime drama I have listened to in along while. The author expertly combines the conflicts ethnic culture, personal tragedy, and work promblem into a into a court room drama. The plot is the difficulties of doing a child rape trial where the victim is silent. The author also shows the personal and work difficulties the D.A. Jin has to overcome to mount a successful. The only drawback is the subject of child rape is gruesome and I personal had to stop reading at times to control my emotions. I am anxious to look forward to more novels about D.A. Jin."
2,"Courtroom Drama, then a Tangled Mess","About halfway through this book I was thinking ""this is the best courtroom drama since To Kill A Mockingbird!"" The book then quickly disintegrated into a confusing tangled web of conspiracy. I got frustrated because it could've been a fantastic book. Mr. Lee just needed to trim a little of the fat."
1,"One word sums it up, HATE","Everybody hates everybody. DA hits cop so cops hate the DA. The judge hates Josh, the main character.Josh;s daughter dies and all the supporting characters in the book make fun of him for crying about it. The 13 year old victim in the book who has been raped is called a tramp a slut by the cops and the judge.Could have been good if it was handled with care and less hate.Could not finish the book so I don't know how it ended and I don't care to find out. Save your money."
1,This is the worst!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This memory card is really bad.Do not buy it won't let me acess my memory and it always says it needs formatting.But if I format I lose all of my memory!Then once you format it it'll say the same thing again.If I could have I would have put no stars at all.I Repeat doooooooo nooooooooooottttttt buyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,BeWare,Ok... I was a normal kid... Just got my birthday money. I was extremley happy. I bought a gamecube a controller a game and this memory card. WHile in the store i saw that it was affordable and i liked the look. I plyed it for about 2 months. I beat almost every game and on my last level of another one....then when i stared playing ...all of a sudden.. Your memory card seems to be coroupted....would you like to format? i press yes it won't work... I got furious! Stick to nitendo.. this just shows you that quality is better than price!! don't buy this.I hope this might have changed your mind if you were willing to buy this shamful product.
1,THIS THING SUCKS!!!! I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE 0 STARS,"Do not buy this. IT DOESN'T WORK!!! It got me really really MAD. It is stupid. For your sake, don't get it. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. It corrupes data and doesn't save right. Buy the other memory chips instead."
3,Max Memory on Amazon,Good working gamecube memory for the wii. Delivery was quick and the price was very low.
2,It was ok,It was not her usual style. Geared for the teen girl readers. It wasn't bad but wasn't great either. Maybe next time
2,Juvenile,"It was too juvenile for my taste. Probably a teenage girl would enjoy it, but I'm a bit past that age."
2,Not the norm,I'm glad I'm already a fan. If this was my first time reading Garwood I would not be back. Not her usual work. Little disappointed.
3,It a great book for teens,This is a good book for teenagers. It would be a good book for them to understand how lies can snowball into things that can hurt themselves and others. Also pride is addressed.
4,loved it.,Love Julie Garwood. I am now reading For the Roses...Terriffic...she is a wonderful author..I have read almost everything she's written
4,A girl named Summer,"this was a great cheesy little story, aimed at a younger person then me :)I think it would be great for the 15 year old set, but nothing like the Julie Garwood I am used too.BUT I did read the whole book :)"
4,Fall in love with Julie Garwood's Style!!,"Julie Garwood's ""A Girl Named Summer,"" was an interesting book. This novel of hers is all going towards teenagers. It's the first time I read a book of hers and I think that she has interesting way of writting. It talks about a Senior(David) and a Sophomore (Summer) falling in love. But when Summer starts to lie to David her problems increase. She has to run in a six-mile race. Who would of thought that lying could get into a lot of trouble? As she works to win the race, she learns alot about herself. She learns that she doesn't need to be like other girls and she learns that you don't need to lie to get a guy."
3,review by a girl named Linda,"This is nothing special to me..just another romance novel.It is about Summer(a girl named Summer!)who likes a boy and tries to win a race to make him like her too.She is so intent on pleasing him and lying to him and impressing him that things get complicated.It kept my attention,for sure,even though it isn't my most perfect cup of tea.I think Julie Garwood had fun writing it."
1,An early effort,"This short novel is an early effort by Julie Garwood of the 1980's so the action and speech is very dated. In the last thirty years teens have become much more sophisticated and view the world from years of electronic media exposure. Garwood's later novels are much better written and more enjoyable and full of action. Jayne Anne Krentz has some novels of the same period that stand the test of time a lot better than this one, but Garwood's recent efforts are very enjoyable."
1,for kids,I love Julie Garwood's books but not this one. It was a book for a teenager not an adult. I will continue buying her books but not one like this one.
3,A Girl Named Summer,"This book is suitable for the younger generation, probably 13 to 18. If viewed from that perspective, the story is interesting, but not one of Julie Garwood's better books. It's a little lackluster."
4,A Girl Named Summer,I didn't realize this was a young adult book when I bought it but I really enjoyed the story. It was a bit more basic than what I am used to reading but it was up to Julie Garwood's usual writing standards. I recommend it for ages 12 and up.
4,Sweet Story,A Girl Named Summer was a good book. Story moved along nicely! Another good book by Julie Garwood. You can not go wrong with book. It was a nice book for younger ladies.
3,Expected,expected outcome for a basic teen non supernatural romance. Just a normal stressed teen w/ normal teen issue's to deal with
3,A Girl Named Summer,"I love Julie Garwood and everything she writes however, if I had known this book was written for teenagers, I wouldn't have purchased it. It was a good read, a nice story of a young girl discovering what she thought was important, really wasn't and being true to oneself is sometimes a difficult life lesson."
5,Magic Phyllis steals the show...,"This album steals the show when compared to all the other greatest hits packages... For the fans it's a fabulous shortcut to the rare gems Phyllis Hyman recorded.I my opinion one of her best tracks ever is here : ""MAGIC MONA"" from the very rare original soundtrack LP of the equally rare movie THE FISH THAT SAVED PITTSBURGH... A track you will grow to love a little bit more with every play."
5,This release compliments the other Phyllis Hyman compilations perfectly.,"This compilation fills in all the missing pieces for us Phyllis Hyman fans by providing some of the more obscure and underappreciated cuts. My favorite of which, ""Magic Mona"" from the motion picture 'The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh' had been on my wish list for years. If you love Phyllis Hyman as many of us do, pick up this CD as it provides all the missing and overlooked pieces from a stellar career that ended much too tragically, and too soon."
5,Waited so long for some of these never released song!!! Love It!!,"Love this cd my husband and I have been waiting for years for some of these song, especially magic Mona to be released!!!!!!!!"
5,I Love Phyllis,Phyllis Hyman was truly a great artist and this album prooves it. I enjoyed it from beginning to end.
5,Needed addition,This antenna is exactly what was needed to catch the signal for our new Sony HD tuner.
4,Antenna,"This antenna removed all the static and channel fade that was present with one of the flat antennas. Simply placing the antenna like a ""T"" was enough to greatly improve the reception. Connecting was simply a matter of screwing in into the receiver."
1,Ante,"I thought this antenna would allow me to get the good music station from Denver to Fort Collins, Colorado but it did not work at all. I returned it and got my money back."
2,Disappointed,"I own a HD radio (Radiosophy). I live in a high rise apartment and I have problems in recieving both analog and HD signals. I thought C.Crane FM reflect antenna will improve reception. Manufacturers say that it improves reception 213% more then regular dipole antenna. Thats wrong. It didnt improve much. In five of my favorite FM HD stations, I get good reception for one station. With this antenna I got two. I still dont get other three. More over this antenna does not look firm as it was shown in pictures. It is nothing but a wire. They say it is flexible and we can adjust in what ever shape we want. But it doesn't stay in the shape we make it. I have to stick it with tape. It is big and does not look good. I mean I have my radio in living room. I cant use this antenna there. It is very high priced. I think if we can get some wire from Radioshack, we can make it on our own. I am going to return this antenna."
2,"The ""Monster Cable"" of antennas","If you believe Monster Cables improve your audio experience dramatically, then buy this antenna, it's for you.The antenna is well made and comes with an F-connector and a balun to convert to 2 spade connectors. The quality is fine.My need for a better antenna was in a challenging setting on the Hood Canal west of Seattle. The Reflect gets the job done--barely. I have read other reviews which state this antenna works no better than a cheap dipole, and based on my experience, I believe that's true. If your application is like mine, where the best position for the antenna is laid out carefully on the floor, then this antenna SHOULD survive being run over by a vacuum cleaner much better than a cheap dipole, but I doubt your reception will be any better!"
4,definitely helped,"This definitely made my reception better. I live in MIlwaukee and listen to ""The Drive-96.9"" from Chicago. This antenna makes the reception significantly better than the tower antenna I bought at Best Buy. It also make sthe local NPR channel I listen to much clearer also. I highly recommend this antenna but if you but it and it doesn't help,then certainly return it. Always save your receipts until you are satisfied."
4,"good improvement, but not monumental","I'm in the city, so I already get a lot of stations - I wanted them even cleaner and more potent through my Sangean hd1 radio tuner. By adding replacing the antenna that came with the unit with the Crane, I got more oomph in the bass (and it was still tight, without spreading out) and more fullness and musicality in the treble. Sounds like a lot of flowery talk, but it did improve the sound. Was it a night and day change? No - with the exception of small chamber ensembles played on our classical station - WOW, better than a cd and about as good as nice vinyl. Did I expect to improve my 8 grand system phenominally or to a point that I couldn't live without it with a 30$ atenna, no - but there was an improvement.In the end, it works, no huge change, and I guess that some people could see similar or better improvements for relatively cheap by upgrading their interconnect wires. It did make a better sound and I'm keeping them."
1,Save Your Money!,"This thing is a complete JOKE! I bought it to boost the reception of my CCradio Plus weather band reception on the recommendation of a support tech at CC Crane. To my surprise, the reception actually got WORSE when this thing was clipped to the whip antenna than without it. I tried moving it around in every conceivable position and shape I could think of and it never improved the signal strength or the audio quality at all. As I said, it actually made both worse!At least for my application, I would suggest you save your money. I am sure a $2.00 dipole would have done the same thing, since all this thing is is a dipole made out of RG56 cable!What a complete waste of time!"
3,trying to receive HD Radio is TRYING!,I tried all of the suggested antenna patterns with little luck. I finally tossed it on a stool next to the radio and all the stations came in. It formed an upside down U pattern.
1,Sent it back,"Very well made, and with a cable connector it might work, but with the adapter it was worse than just a plain wire antenna...."
2,Didn't help,"I work in a high rise office building. I am in a cubicle away from the windows. I was unable to get FM reception for my favorite radio station so I tried this antenna and it didn't help. I got a new radio and it does help a little bit, although the reception is a little scratchy."
2,so far no different than a simple dipole,"Had reception problems but thought it might help and so far. . . no different than a simple dipole. Will I give another chance by reconfiguring? Yes, but have my doubts."
2,No better than a $2 indoor dipole antenna,"I hoped to ""clean up"" my fm reception a bit with this antenna. I replaced my $2 indoor dipole antenna with this $30 antenna and discovered absolutely no difference in fm reception. The strong fm stations were still strong but the weak fm stations showed no improvement. Save your money or test it and return it as I did."
1,crane fm antenna,"The crane fm antenna proved to be only slightly better than a 300 ohm dipole available from Radio Shack for about $3-$4.00. Keep in mind that the higher up on the wall you go or hung with string (to prevent interference) from a window shade cross member, the better your reception will be with any indoor dipole type antenna. Buy a dipole for $3-$4 and use the remainder for something else."
5,"Funny, tragic, and compelling","A small but complex story. The dialogue is hilarious, the characters interesting. Get your hands on a copy while you still can."
3,Blah blah blah blah,Book was ok. Lot of dialog written in slang that took a while to decipher. Once you figured out the characters the verbal dialog flowed better. The characters were not properly described in the beginning so you were on your own to figure how they would sound if they spoke.Too much chattering nonsensical talking.
4,Classic George Higgins fare,"A fast read about the usual assortment of Boston lowlifes, corrupt attorneys and assorted sadsacks who inhabit the world of George Higgins. The witty dialogue is vintage Higgins. Highly recommended to all readers who like their crime novels gritty and hard-boiled."
5,Accept with Udo,"This album rocks! How do I describe Accept's sound with words? Udo is the original and Accept brings it with this album. If you like Accept, you'll definitely want to add this album to your collection."
2,THE MAGIC IS GONE,"ACCEPT tried desperately to go with the flow in this album. It is really fast-paced, heavy and furious, following the metal genre stablished in the 90's by such acts as Slayer, Megadeth, etc. But this is not what ACCPET was made famous for. ACCEPT was did, guided by Wolf Hoffmann great guitar work, classical metal music, melodic and inspiring. This is not the case for this album."
1,This Book Stunk to High Heaven,"Don't waste your money as I have. I found this book to not only be lacking in the information needed to pass the test with any confidence but the information is soooo outdated it's not even funny. A perfect example is the mention that OC-4 is currently the highest level which is completely incorrect. The latest OC level is 192. And it can't possibly be something that was overlooked or created since the book was released since the OC-48 and 192 was out way before 1996! It's just one example of the gibberish that is written in this book. If you want a good mixture go with Exam-Cram, Core Exams in a nutshell by Oreilly and the Sybex book. The combo of the three is enough to get you through the test with flying colors."
4,I Recommend This Book,"I think the material in the book is quite nicely laid out, logical, etc. I recommend buying this book as your main text. It's not perfect but it's not bad, and I know what a bad study book is. I also suggest that Networking Essentials is the right starting point for those wanting to become MCSE's. With no prior experience, I did find the material presented to be a steep learning curve. Although the book says, at the beginning, that no prior experience is necessary (other than familiarity with Windows & the mouse) I was glad that I had A+ certification, which helped me somewhat in understanding this book. Get the 'Computer Desktop Encyclopedia' or a computer/networking dictionary, Mr. Nash's book has a lot of vocabulary that isn't covered by his book's glossary. Also get the errata sheet he mentions. In addition to this book, two others I used & really liked are MCSE Readiness Review Exam 70-058 (MS Press) and MCSE-The Core Exams in a Nutshell (O'Rielly)."
3,"Pretty Good, however I found it to be incomplete !","Maybe it was my mistake, but I found after reading this book, I picked up another one for the same exam, and noticed some more exam material that wasn't even covered in this book. I must admit that this book is well written, and informative though, but I would prefer another one over this one."
4,Good for what it wants to tell you,"The book is good for getting across what it wants to, but doesnot cover all material. I used this and the Dummies. This one has afew more features like creating your own network. Neither had all the information (like NWLink and both were severly lacking in the troubleshooting dept.) This book had a few mistakes like Class A IP boundaries and I'm pretty sure the FDDI classes are backwards. However, they both provide enough to get through practice exams quickly. That way you can focus on questions pertaining to information they don't provide. Take notes and do as many practice tests as you can, I did and owe my 900 score to it. Beware the new drag and drop questions! My test was 30 questions, non-adaptive."
5,Very Informative,"I don't know why everyone writes in about typos, who cares? This book is well laid out and covers a lot of topics essential to the exam. You can learn a lot from this book. A great jumping off point!!"
2,Not your best bet,"I did not like this book. There is a lot of information in it, but it is not very well presented, nor is it particularly complete. I passed the exam, but I combined this book with other material I found on the net (mainly from the Cisco site). The exam was really easy, though. Look elsewhere if you want a good introduction to networking fundamentals."
3,"Good overall, but could have been organized better","I found this book confusing the first time through it. After rereading it, I discovered that it was less confusing, and realized that a different organizational structure would have helped a LOT. I also found some typos and mistakes in the instant assessment answers. Finally, there were some things that I discovered were some details that the book left out that were covered on the test.With that said, I did ace the test on my first try, but I was very nervous before and during the test!"
3,Good doing what it does. But it doesn't do it all...,"It misses some parts of the exam topics, and it has som nasty mistypings and errors in the ""instant assesment""-answers...Good doing what it does. But it doesn't do it all...Use it as a companion with another book, and never alone..."
4,"Very complete, doesn't talk enough about Windows NT issues.",Book stresses too much about Arcnet and Token ring and doesn't talk enough about Fast Ethernet. Would have liked more information about Routers. The test had more Windows NT Issues than the book covered. All and all was an easy book to read and covered most aspects that helped me pass the test on the first try. Learned much from this book
4,Excellent BOOK!!! Passed exam on first try!,This book will definitely cover all the necessary things you need to learn for the exam. Spent two weeks on this book and took the exam and passed!Only shortcoming is this book does not give enough test or preparatory questions. Just one set. But I guess you can buy additional material for the exam questions...
5,Rival 20 quart Roaster Oven,I absolutely love this oven. I have had mine for almost 6 years and use it for many things. I bought the insert also to be able to keep my other foods warm and as a serving buffet. It cooks my 26 lb turkeys in about 5 hours to perfection. I receive so many compliments on my meals when using this oven. I take it to work to do the turkey for work each year. I also made several racks of barbeque pork ribs in it and they were the bomb. The meat came out and the bones stayed in the pan. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone.PS. It also frees up my oven and microwave for other dishes and I cook in the garage on top of my washer freeing up space in the kitchen and also will not heat up the kitchen.
5,AWESOME CHEERLEADING CD,This was the best Cheerleading CD that I ever bought. I enjoyed it because it had Cheerleading remixes of the best songs.
1,"Totally agree ""Ripped off""",If ordering you must me in desparete need of any music because this cd has only few songs that are slightly mixed but not together! Hardly any team uses just one song in their rutine so you would need to mix this cd again yourself.It's not ready-to-use material.
2,Definately a 'christian' documentary,"Very informative, but too much churchyness for my taste. I wanted an unbiased documentary, but this was obviously made by church people. There was very little discussion about the pagan beliefs and I think there are and were gargoyles on more than just churches. I think some of the chinese figures were possibly made before christianity even happened. I am not sure tho if the chinese designs are labeled as gargoyles. And the ancient egyptians had what were gods, but gargoyle like features. I had hoped for info on those sculptures as well. Oh Well, live and learn :) Some of it was interesting, just not enough ;)"
4,One truly great show,I loved the drama and behind the scenes extra's. It's such a shame this went off the air. All the actors were excellent in this thriller.
1,how to play?,I can't find any 'play' button on the web site or instructions on how one play these items????
3,True Gothic Literature,"Matthew Lewis is by most people's accounts one of the forefathers of Gothic Literature. ""The Monk"" written in the late 18th century is an interesting tale about an Abbot whose vocation to God goes awry. The language of the text can sometimes be hard to follow if you are not accustomed to reading literature from that time period, but the story is nearly flawless. Lewis also places other characters of ill repute in the novel. My favorite being the Head nun of St. Clare's, in my opinion she is more of the villain than the monk. Throughout the tale the characters relate past tale's which can be tedious and boring at times, but do help to fill in any missing gaps the reader may have. All in all Lewis wrote a dark tale which will continue to be read for centuries to come, and his contribution to the Gothic novel will never be forgotten."
2,liteature of taste...,"should both teach and delight. The Monk's delights are many, but it teaches not. therefore, two stars."
3,Sensational Gothic suspenser,"This is dated stuff, with its flowery descriptions, its melodramatic dialogue and situations and its hackneyed plot, with its reliance on coincidences and mistaken identities. Still, I haven't read a book recently that has breathed a more potent air of menace and evil. The suggestion of atmosphere is strong and the latent eroticism and perversion contribute a great deal to the tension."
3,Creepy,"The Monk is defintely a creepy read, just keep in mind that it was written 200 years ago and the language can be a little dense. There are some excellent scenes but then there are a few sections that can be rough to get through. Depending how much work you want to put into it, The Monk can be very rewarding. If you aren't patient though, it may be best to look elsewhere."
4,Unique...,"This is probably the most unique concept I've come across. The idea of a the city's consciousness manifesting itself is fresh and interesting. It's hard to believe this title is as old as it is. It seems like recently written cyberpunk. Pretty obvious that instead, all other cyberpunk has taken from it."
3,The parameters of urban morality,"Shirley's early novel ""City Come A Walkin'"" takes us on a surreal (and frequently brutal) jaunt through a near-future San Fransisco where the city's overmind has the ability to manifest as a mirrorshades-wearing techno-shaman with a marked dislike for bad guys. The brilliance and terror behind this straight-forward tale is Shirley's refreshing refusal to cling to genre conceits. ""City Come A Walkin'"" challenges the nature of identity as well as the parameters of urban morality."
4,Super Reader,"If you know who Jack Hawksmoor of the Authority is, you will get some of the vibe here. San Francisco is making its own superheroes, to help combat corruption, takeover and neglect of its internal systems, and organised crime control of finance. However, it needs assistants, and ends up possessing those bodies, with their physical forms being destroyed.Other cities are on a similar path, by the end, without the superhero manifestations. This is superhero in the Authority sense, too.The protagonist is an aging music club owner, deeply in debt to his mob, who, of course, has a thing for the singer in one of his support acts. The problem is, that City does not trust her."
4,If you use Windows XP. . .,"Better check out the HP website. . .All in all, I am inmpressed. However, if you use the new Windows XP operating system, the scan buttons will not funtion; you actually tell the scanner portion what to do from your computer (under ""my pictures""). HP actually has good explanations on using this PSC with Win XP. It seems that no one has a printer geared specifically towards XP at the moment; though as drivers and software become available, HP will notify you (if you sign up for the email notification service)."
5,very pleased,"Have had this since christmas, not a single complaint. Great quality no matter what the useage. For all in one that is a good value get this. You wouln't be sorry."
5,The all-in-one that beats all of them.,"This. printer/scanner/copier is the best one I have used so far, I had a Lexmark X83 but this is much better. Though the specifications are almost exact, when you actually have used both of them you find the quality of this HP PSC 750 is the better of the two. Th Hp Psc is a little bit smaller and saves space."
1,Waste of money,"I ordered an HP PSC 750 multifunction printer from a Nick Ruparel in January. I wrote him several times to complain that it didn't work. It was rated as 'like new' and it looked like new but the indicator screen flashed ""check color print cartridge'. I inserted a new color cartridge and got the same message. It printed from the top screen but did not acknowledge my computer. He answered none of my messages so I returned it. UPS said it was undeliverable and returned it to me.I am not only out the price of the printer and postage two ways but also the cost of the color ink cartridge I used to check it and they are quite expensive for this model.This printer was very poorly packed when it arrived.This was to be a replacement for the same model I had before so it wasn't that I didn't know how to use it or hook it up."
3,Critical Tech Enthusiast,"Overall, I have not had much trouble with this device. Although, it tends to stop scanning when you send it to a program. In addition, the system tends to delay for printing pictures. The copier is not that great, the pic quality is nothing exciting. The major problem is that if you are to upgrade to Windows XP, the system is not formatted to work with the operating system. Thus, leaving you with one small problem, forget the upgrade, or buy a new printer."
2,Problems!,"A good printer, but there are some serious bugs. Do a thorough Google search for ""HP PSC 750"" and you'll see what I mean. The HP drivers cause problems in lots of computers, including system lock-ups, huge wait times (5-10 minutes) and crashes. I had to download a driver patch written by some other printer owner, since nobody can get HP to do anything about the troubles. Even with the patch, there is a noticeable performance hit after installing it.The printer also sometimes mysteriously drops the USB connection, requiring me to completely uninstall and reinstall the software. It's very frustrating. I'm not making this up. It is all very well documented in HP's costumer support forum ....When it's working, I really like it. The scanner is very nice, and the print quality is good. But frankly, I can't say it's worth the frustration."
2,"Nice start, but...","As others have seen, this and some other HP products has that ""scan failure"" problem that can appear almost any time, with a new unit or right after the warranty ends. Despite its otherwise nice features I would never buy this again, and this makes me to consider that the replacement will not be HP."
2,HP PSC 1350 - and bugs,"I bought this printer recently and followed the instructions to install it. However, I have two problems now. The first is that if I do not turn off the printer when the computer is off, upon re-start I get error messages at a very low level and the computer will not boot up. Fortunately, when I turn off the printer and re-start the computer, then every thing seems ok.The second problem is that something happened to my MS IE 6, I can now no longer have the Home page I want and invariably while surfing I just get a blank page. It is really frustrating as many of my applications (like Home Banking) are no longer working. Although the printer prints well, I would not recommend it until something is done about their installation software."
5,The BEST office Tool I have ever gotten,"I have been selling real estate for 20 yrs. Have purchased many printers, copy machines, & scanners over the years. The ""pcs750"" IS THE BEST office product I have ever purchased.Color Scanner works FAST. Black and COLOR printer works FAST.And the copy functions are wonderful. This ONE machine replaced 3 machines. AND the QUALITY is great. What else can I ask for?I am very busy and would not spend time sending this email IF I WERE NOT REALLY REALLY PLEASED with this product.I have been telling lots of people about this fantastic PRINTER, COPIER, & SCANNER !"
4,NO PROBLEMS SO FAR!!,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I GOT IT SOMETIME IN LATE DECEMBER AND I INSTALLED IT WITH ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS!! IT PRINTS REALLY FAST AND IT'S QUIET. THE COPIER FUNCTION IS AMAZING! I COPIED A COLOR PHOTO OF MY DAUGTHER AND THE COLORS AND CLARITY ARE AMAZING. I ALSO REALLY LIKE THAT IT'S A STAND ALONE PRINTER. I'M STILL FIGURING OUT THE SCANNING FUNCTION, BUT THE PICTURES I'VE SCANNED SO FAR HAVE COME OUT QUITE NICE. I AM NOT A ""TECHIE"" TYPE PERSON, BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. THE ONLY REASON WHY I TOOK AWAY A STAR WAS BECAUSE I DID NOT LIKE THAT THE MACHINE DID NOT COME WITH A USB CABLE! I HAD TO WAIT ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE I COULD HOOK IT UP."
2,"""Scanner Failure""","As you have likely read in many other posts... This is a great all around printer for a while. I have had mine for about 4 years and it worked like a dream, but now I frequently get the ""scanner failure"" message. One reviewer mentioned wanting to throw it out the window... I wholly agree. I have felt that way many, many times. I don't care how cheap you can get this, if you want it to last for a long time, look for something else."
2,Scanner/copier dead,After 1 year the scanner/copier functions stopped working. I called the supplier and was told it was probably broke and would cost more to repair than buy a new one. I don't think so! The next multi-function printer I purchase will not be an HP.
3,"Loved it at first, but problems develop","I bought this printer a little over 2 years ago. At first I loved it, especially having a flatbed scanner on top. Now it has developed a problem where every time I try to scan or copy it has a ""scanner failure"". I usually can get it to work after unplugging it and then doing a scan without anything actually on the glass. Unfortunately I have found this is a common problem (try typing - hp psc scanner failure - into a search engine and see what comes up!). For this reason my next all-in-one will not be HP. Check out the reviews for the Canon multifunciton machines, they look much better!"
1,Waste of time,"I don't see how anyone with any respect for theirown intelligence as a human being could like this... not only were most of Limbaugh's views completely unsupported by fact, the book was poorly written, full of repetetive, ineffective writing schemes (lots of rhetorical questions, the main point of which seems to be to reinforce the already converted's views), and lots of nasty ad _hominem_ attacks (underlined for those at the Conservative Bookstore). Basically, the book must be wonderful for those with a weak grasp on political issues and that love anything that comes out of Rush's mouth, but for us with any real knowledge of politics it is a downright insult."
2,Professional Snipe Proves His Wit Is Dulling,"Regardless of your opinion of the writer's politics, this is just a really bad book. Poorly written, with no apparent thought put into structure, emphasis has been put on maintaining what I guess Mr. Limbaugh feels is his 'style'. Bold statements of opinion are stated as fact, with virtually no documentable facts given to back up the statements. When an opposing opinion is cited, it is always accompanied by a long list of childish insults aimed at the opposition. A purely selfish book, with only the faintest hint of interest in giving the buyer a decent read. Some funny lines, but they are almost all rather cruel insults, aimed at individuals and groups who are a bit helpless - the jokes seem more bitter and vicious than they really need to be. OVERALL GRADE: D"
1,ANOTHER JOURNALISTIC MARVEL,"WHAT!?....another book? As if the first wasn't enough. Give the man his due, he knows how to make money. Scary, ain't it?Who's buying these things?GW?...no,he doesn't like to read. Oh well, to each his own. Personally, I would recommend ""Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot"" by Al Franken over this one.By the way I had to give this book one star because there was no option below that"
2,Worth every penny...or uh one anyway,"Well yes this might make a fair bit more sense if one is buzzing on a large amount of pain killers one has bought from one's maid. You'd think it might make a little less sense to anyone else, say the editors or more sober readers...but I digress, what I intend to addres is the actual contents of the book - which by the way are well worth the one penny cost advertised in the used Amazon section accompanying this book. Well actually intellectual coherence isn't exactly Rush's strongpoint. And at this point isn't he a tad passe as well? I mean Ann Coulter is more ""outrageous"" or juvenile depending on your sobriety level and Hannity is more craven and mean than Rush. So what precisely is the point of Rush at this stage? He's not even that fat anymore, he's possibly remotely sober...I guess the kick is gone?"
1,Poor writing,"Rush is a has been. I didn't even know who this guy was until I saw him on ESPN talking about football. So I back tracked and picked up this book. Now every time I see him talk about sports I wish he would shut his pie hole because he can't write. I think this guy is out to get angry white guys in Alabama riled up. I gave this book to a friend and he hated it. You know what I said? See, I told you so."
5,Go Rush!,A well-written book and a well-narrated audio. Rush has one of the most recognizable and listenable voices on the air and he directs his opinions on various social and political subjects eloquently and with knowledge.
2,Ditto,"This is the book that explains where Rush is coming from but does not go into where he's going.We will wait for the explanation as to why Aschroft would send a liberal like Tommy Chong to jail and let a conservatie like Rush off with just a warning. This will be out in a book called ""The Agony and The XTC"" as soon as Rush sweats off a few ""Youthfull Indescrcetions""."
5,Amazing Insight!,What's better than the bitter drab ramblings of a fat right-wing psycho hopped up on enough pain killers to kill an elephant? Nothing! This book has given me an amazing insight into the schizophrenic lifestyle of a decadent hypocrite oozing oxycontin from the bowels. A truly necessary read for any young republican looking forward to a gaudy lifestyle of greed and lies. Thanks Rush!
3,"Rush may be right, a second time","Polemical sequel to Limbaugh's first foray into socio-political journalism, ""See I told you so"" continues Rush's expose of a blatant hypocrisy intrinsic to the liberal left. Lacking the elitist style of those eloquent musings by such ultra-conservative luminaries as William F. Buckley or Joseph Sobran, Limbaugh still scores direct hits on the key issues endemic to the liberal agenda. Hard hitting and well written, this book is definitely worth the time and effort to clearly understand the machinations of our intransigent, entrenched liberal cabal."
5,Penetrating and Humorous Expose of Liberalism,"At one time, liberalism stood for liberty, equality, and justice. But no more. Rush emphasizes the fact that the essence of contemporary liberalism is increasing dependence upon government in exchange for votes. Rush exposes the liberals' attacks on the middle class for not being compassionate enough, for equating upward mobility with greed, and for associating spiritual and moral values with intolerance. Rush also quotes George Washington and James Madison to point out the Judeo-Christian roots of our Constitution and our society, something all but lost on liberal judges. We learn of the past doom and gloom predictions of the environmentalists, which I personally well remember, none of which have come true--not even close. Rush also challenges us to live up to our potential, and recounts his own setbacks in life (such as being fired six times, and being broke twice). As a result, Rush' views are based on real life."
1,A classic primer for dolts!,What can I say? A classic book extolling the virtues of right wing nut neo-fascism!
3,good with sometimes weird taste,"It was very easy to install and includes a quick switch between filtered water and regular tap water. Initially, the water tasted very much like chlorine or a chemical. They ask you to run it for 5 seconds each time you use it before using it. After a week or so either I got used to the weird taste or the weird taste mostly disappeared. However, we've now had it for a few weeks and someone in our household noticed that after filling a water bottle with water from the tap, when they reopened the full water bottle it smelled a little like chlorine. We will probably keep the filter for now, but eventually we will probably replace it with something else, even though the something else will probably have a lower number of gallons filter life."
3,nice book,"it is first book tat i bought on this topic as it did not overwhelm me as other books that i saw on the shelf. As i think it is supposed to be easy guide, it does not have alot of information on type of brushes to use, paints and brush techniques. however, the designs are simple and quick to do and appealing for me.one of the best feature is that it gives you step by step paintings of how the flower is drawn and it shows arrows to indicate the directions of the brush strokes. The pictures are also shown close enough like it is painted on the pages of the book. i think that's how you are supposed to learn from the bookhowever, if you are looking for things like brush techniques or more detailed information / instructions, this may not be the book for you.give it 3 stars becoz i feel it cld have been slightly more descriptive in instructions."
4,OK Beginner Puzzle Book.,"You get 100 puzzles with solutions in the back of the book. Puzzles are from recent (2000-2003) named tournament games. Puzzles 1-29 are easy Mate in 1. Most of the rest are Mate in 2 moves, some easy, some slightly harder. This is a beginner puzzle book which requires only basic chess knowledge. I found 1 error in solution # 45; otherwise this book is well done. I think the only issue I have with this book is there is only one puzzle per page. It could have easily been at least 2 per page for a better value."
3,Could be better,"A nice book, But it could be better.First off there are some problems in the book marked ""look for 2 ways or look for 3 ways"" and you'll find 3 or even 4 ways and there not listed, You'll even find 2 or 3 answers on puzzels that should have only one.Second, Every puzzle starts with white to move, Lets change it up a little, How about Black to move, Mate in two.That being said I did enjoy this book, Some puzzles were just too easy and some stumped me for a time.This book is written for beginners and I would recomend it to such, If not for the errors I would have given this book 4 stars."
4,Successor of 70's Rock Feel,"If you like Blackmore, Dio, Whitesnake...the age of Rock Renaissance, then listen Axel Rudi Pell carefully.Axel Rudi Pell received the feel of 70's rock, and added his own color.Returned to the core of rock n' roll.Not the technique and style, but the attitude and philosopy.I have 7 albums of this team.And I satisfied all of them and almost every track.I strongly recommend Axel Rudi Pell's albums for rock fan."
5,Great album,"***** stars**** great albumJust like Rainbow (with DIO) One of the best guitar players in the world. So much better than Clapton, Paget etc."
4,Great book!,"Grand Rapids is my birthplace and as we are traveling in a motorhome now, this book helps explain our roots to our new acquaintances. I bought it at a great price and it is in great condition. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Overall a good program with a very significant flaw.,"I found the program fairly intuitive to start using, and the tutorial was moderately helpful. However, the program does not allow designing for ""English"" (view-out or walk-out) style basements where some of the basement elevation is above grade. This is not stated anywhere in the software description or reviews-in fact, based on comments about designing the slope or grade for the lot, I believed the program could accomplish this (fairly simple) task. If it could, I'd give the program a 4 star review - but as it is now, the program is useless to me."
2,You must have time and patience,"I bought this thinking that it was a snap to use easy WISYWIG and all around perfect tool for the average home user. Was I mistaken!! I agree with the previous post that you must have time and patience. If you're using this to get general ideas on your landscape and decks and you have the time to figure how use the software then this program is for you. I spent 4 hours just trying to figure out how the program worked and I still could not figure it our completely. Very frustrating.. One disappointing feature was that I require exact measurements with certain selection. (Property Boundary, House dimensions, and similar) Believe me when I say I needed to be accurate to the inch. However, it was only after I called Customer Support did I find out that this program does not allow calculations to exact measurements. The price with rebate and Customer support was fine, but not enough to tip the scales for a favorable rating.Maybe Version 8 will be more user friendly."
1,Product/Service falls short,"This program seems excellent based on the description of features. However, the program is extremely slow, has major glitches, and falls way short of expectations.The major glitch that I ran into is that the 3D function doesn't work. The first time I used the program, I was able to view things in 3D. During the next several attempts, I was unable to view anything in 3D because IT DIDN'T EVEN SHOW UP IN THE PROGRAM!I tried to return the product directly to the Manufacturer. They would not accept it back because I was a couple of days beyond their 90 day warranty. Don't waste your money on this product like I did. If you're looking for something like this, check out the Punch! Software titles."
1,What a waste of time.,"Too many glitches and bugs to talk about. Their website was of no help and after waiting for phone tech support, (my nickel) for a half hour, they couldnt resolve any of the problems. They said they would give me my money back, but how about the three days I spent screwing around with this piece of trash?One particular problem is that saving a file overwrites the old one without removing any of the deleted changes. The result is a uselss mess. Another is that for no apparent reason it does not choose to save some items, so when the file is brought back up all the work has to be done over again. Of course if you expect to print what you see on the screen you are dreaming.Break out the graph paper and pencil. You will do the job in half the time. Take the money and buy some plants."
1,does NOT work with Windows 2000,"Even though the box says this product will work with Windows 2000, it does NOT. It locked up everytime we tried to draw our landscaping plan. Tech support was of no use whatsoever and eventually told us to send it back, which we did and 6 weeks later we have YET to get a refund.I will never buy another product from Sierra Home again."
2,Installation Procedure,"What a test of endurance to install the software. Firstly, you will have to go through the installation process for each of the seven modules althogh they ask the same questions and, for some reason, complain about screen resolutions that are above 640 x 480! When running the modules I have, several times, been issued a warning that the appropriate CD is not in the tray. This warning simply says that a certain folder (N:\DECK\DECK for example) is not available. There is no tie-up associating the required files to a CD number. Why not a simple ""Please insert CD-3 in the drive""?I've only used the software for a simple low level deck project where, from the rear of my house I wish to walk down stairs to the ground level deck. It doesn't seem to like adding stairs that go to the deck? I will experiment more."
1,Doesn't work!,"The Land Designer portion of this software will not work at all on my computer. I have a new computer that well exceeds all of the system requirements. I'm running Windows XP on it. The program won't even open. I e-mailed customer service and the best they could do was tell me to clean the cd with water and then reinstall it!? Needless to say, that didn't work. The Photo Garden Designer portion worked fine, but that's not what I bought it for! Don't waste your time or money on this program."
2,"Nice features, but very buggy","I had version 6.0 of this software and tried upgrading to 7.0, hoping it would cure some of the problems. The program has great features (for the price)... like being able to pick from a large catalog of plants, see 2D and 3D versions of your layout, and watch your landscape project grow and change with time and seasons. But the software is buggy. Every time I tried placing a driveway on my lot, the program crashed. Worse yet, the original creator (Sierra software) no longer develops the software. The new vendor was very helpful and willing to support, but they provide no fixes. I ended up asking for a refund. Unfortunate."
3,Good -- but not for experienced bird owner.,"If you are researching the Quaker, as a previous bird owner, this may not be the book for you. However, if you are a first time bird owner, I would give it 5 stars. I would have preferred more specific species information. Thank you."
5,Cute Pictures!,"Great pictures, makes you want to run right out and purchase your parrot! Very informative also. I enjoyed it."
5,Pretty fair value for a tried-and-true product!,"I'm a long-time user of Cascade ... the dishwasher detergent that's known for eliminating water spots from glasses.I enjoy the convenience and efficiency of the water-soluble pouches in this current product, and since you get five boxes with 28 pouches in each, the ""bang for your buck"" isn't bad, either.I find it hard to stock up on everything (lack of shelf-space), but this is one item that doesn't take much space. Give it a try!"
1,Cascade and Hard Water,"Do not use this product if your tap water is hard, and you have no water softening built in to your home. It leaves a horrible residue.This is especially true of Bosch Dishwashers, which also handle hard water very poorly."
1,50% of the time they don't dissolve,half the time these packets don't dissolve which is incredibly frustrating when your dishwasher has spent 2 hours in cleaning mode wasting water and energy doing nothing. I have found the packages either part way dissolved or not dissolved at all at the end of the wash. This product is completely wasteful.
2,Hmmm... not as good as I initially thought.,"I've been using these packs for a couple of years and thought they were excellent. However, I could never understand why I had a little ring of bubbles around the top of my water when I poured a glass. I thought my rinsing agent wasn't working so I changed brands.Tonight, I ran the dishwasher on RINSE mode - without putting a soap packet in, that is - and am shocked by the amount of suds that resulted. Absolutely shocked. Did I mention that I was shocked?? I can't believe how much soap residue is left behind by this product and will stop using it once this package is finished. In the meantime, I'm going to run a rinse cycle at least once a week. Man...!"
4,Cascade action pacs,My dishes are clean and my kitchen smells delightfully orange. What more can you ask?
1,Thumbs Down!!!!,"don't waste your money, please. I bought into this course years ago and now I see that there are so many snake oil products out there that are bad but better and at least more informative than this rip off scam. He sucks people in by claiming they will make huge financial profits than wonders my members get pissed why they lose money. His books are about as informative about trading as an Archie comic book. There are great authors and a few good mentors out there. Find them and then observe the markets as much as possible before trading your money away. I have to give it 1 star, they won't allow no stars."
1,Not very sturdy,I've had this feeder for less than a year and I have to replace it. I took it down to clean it and the bottom part that keeps the seed in is broken and will not fit tightly back in. The only cheaply made part of this feeder is that part but it's pretty important!
2,bottom falls out,"It's fun to watch the goldfinches turn upside down to get the seed, while the purple finches are confounded by their inability to get their meal. But the feeder has an inane design. The bottom of the feeder - which has to support about 2 lbs of seed - is a flimsy piece of plastic held in place merely by small, short tabs that insert into slots in the cylindrical body of the feeder. As soon as the feeder deforms at all in the sun, the tabs slip and the bottom falls out. Along with all the seed. It isn't hard to fix by drilling four holes and weaving in thin wire for extra support (thus two stars instead of one), but whoever designed this should be sent back to kindergarten."
1,Perky Pet Upside down thistle feeder,"If you're bothered by squirrels stealing bird feed, DON'T BUY THIS FEEDER! The squirrels ate out the bottom of this one in just the first day it was up. Emptied the whole bottom section. Do not buy unless you can position it in a squirrel-proof location."
5,Its worth a Few Dollars More,"For years, all I had was the U.S. release of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. I picked this up as it was a 'suggestion' after I bought a Japanese release of TGTBTU. And I am glad I did! The sound quality is high, and this contains tracks that I heard in the movie but am not that familiar with. If you like either Morricone or are a fan of this trilogy, you won't be dissappointed."
3,Not for Begginer,"This book has the same question as that of the test. It gives detailed about what is the right things to do, but the bad part to it is that all of the answer are in the wrong order. I do not recommend this to any begginner or entry level parts person who does not understand the true content of an ase test. But for those who have known how an ase test is like this can become a book that may help you greatly."
2,trigger,"After setting the trigger mechanism, it was so tight that a block of hardwood would not set it off. In order to set the trigger it took a needle nose plier to bend it the way it should have been at the factory. I have used live traps, like this one, for over 35 years. I should have sent it back, but I needed it right away. The cage also rusted in spots after 3 days."
5,Quality product at a bargain price,I am extremely pleased with this vest. It is a perfect fit; runs true-to-size. It is very well made and the fleece fabric is very high quality; heavier and more substantial than all the others I've had. I will probably order it in more colors.
5,"Good plush fabric, nicely trimmed and good tailoring.","This was bought for my wife. She is very pleased with it. It is new, so I won't know about how it will last, but it is worthy of any good outdoor clothing store."
3,OK. Poor quality control in stitching.,"The fabric of this vest is thin and does not insulate as well as Polartec. However, it looks nice and is OK for moderately cold weather. The fit is snug. On the 2nd day I wore the vest, a 5-6"" pice of one of the side seams opened . All seams are double stitched, except two - under each arm. It was a single stitched seam that opened up and you could see that the stitching was sloppily done. I can stitch it up myself, but it won't look as good as the original."
5,love it!,"this is my new default lens, i have it on my t3i currently and the photos come out great! i would suggest this as a good basic lens for any beginning and ameteur photographer."
3,Not awful.... but not great.,"I have this lens on my XSi and although it isn't great, it's not nearly as bad as some are making it out to be. The images aren't very sharp and the colors are a little dulled(which I've found can be easily fixed with white balance adjustments) but what can you really expect from a lens in this price range? In my opinion, this lens is about equal with your standard 18-55mm kit although I like the range of the 28-105mm a little bit more. If you have the money, I would definitely suggest taking the next step up and getting the 3.5-4.5.... I hear that lens is pretty incredible for the price and takes nice sharp pictures."
1,A bad lens rendered irrelevant by the faster version.,"There's not much to say that hasn't been covered by the other reviews; this is a bad lens. If it were considerably cheaper it would be attractive for really low-budget amateurs. At the $150 price point, the performance shortcomings do not justify the cost.I bought this lens because bottom dollar was my #1 priority, and this was a mistake. Canon's faster/stronger/more robust sister lens is (at most) $100 more expensive and the results are vastly superior.One particularly disturbing aspect of this cheap-feeling plastic lens is the fact that the forward tube, when extended at 105mm, wiggles back and forth noticeably - the mechanical tolerances on this device are horrible. I also found that it is very easy to get dust and dirt into this lens (probably also due to the bad tolerances), so don't try to use it in a dirty environment."
1,No reason to buy this lens,"There's absolutely no reason to buy this lens when you can instead get the Canon EF 28-105 f/3.5-4.5. It's a faster lens with signiicantly better image and build quality, and is only about $50 more than this cheap plastic/slower version."
2,spend a bit more and buy the 3.5-4.5,"For $100 more, buy the 28-105mm 3.5-4.5 version. results are far better. This lens (4-5.6) is not quite there. don't even buy it."
1,"If I could give it less than 1 star, I would!","Even on a tight budget, these lens are not worth getting. Poor contrast, poor light, and especially has lack of sharpness in photos. At first I thought something was wrong with my technique, but then realized it was the lens. It also takes forever to focus in low light. Go with the other reviewer...spend an extra $50.00 and get the 3.5 version of 28-105"
2,It's not horrible... but close...,"I have to agree with other reviewers. However to show a couple GOOD points- it's compact, and has a nice quiet zoom. However it's price range is really not worth it."
2,Quality and price match,"Once again, you get what you pay for. I use this with a Rebel XTi. This lens works great, quiet enough focus and covers a good range at a great price. However, I hope you like your pictures a little soft. All my pictures are a little soft with this lens. It is worth a little more money to get a better lens. If you are just a student or taking a photography class and don't really need super sharp pictures this may be great for you."
5,Love this movie,"This movie has quite a bit of language, brief nudity and violence, so it is not for your little horse-crazy girl. Having said that, it is a great movie for older teen, and adult, that still loves horses and longs to compete in the upper levels of English riding. It follows Charlie(Melissa Gilbert), a girl who trains a cow horse to go to the 3-day Event in Kentuky. Lots of great riding scenes, both western and english, a side love story between Charlie and Matt, played by the same actor as Jake Ryan in 16 candles, Michael Schoeffling. I have been watching this movie since I was about 17, and I still love it today."
4,Great Movie for Horse Lovers,"I saw this movie originally in the theatre when I when I was in my teens and it was great then and great now. Cheesy, yes, but the story is still interesting and worth it. I recommend it to anyone who loves horses. Espcially those in the pre-teen set."
5,Cool flick!,"I saw this movie for the first time as a teenager. I'm much older now, and still enjoy it!I wish I could be an Olympic Equestrian Team memvber, but I don't jump horses, and only know the basics of Dressage. I can still dream though!Excellent movie for the horse lover!"
2,"Very disappointed, should not be rate PG!!!!","I bought this movie for my 2 horse loving daughters. While the story line is a good classic horse story- wild rodeo type horse becomes 3 day event champion, the rest of it is terrible. The language is horrible and should not be rated PG. Also there is a pretty graphic scene where one the stable hands tries to rape Charlie ( Melissa Gilbert). I am guessing that PG rating were different when this movie was made in the 80's, but I have never seen a PG movie quite like this. If you are looking for a wholesome family horse story, this is NOT your movie. I will be reselling this one."
5,Great Movie,Great movie. I must have missed this gem in 1985 but it is a great horse movie. Melissa Gilbert plays her role well and the romance she encounters is not overpowering.
1,NOT Celtic/New Age!,"I was browsing the 'Celtic/New Age' genre, and ran across this ... it's simply NOT 'New Age', and NOT 'Celtic'.Buyer beware!"
2,Maybe a Band-Aid Will Help,I thought that the book had a good way of explaining to young children that Mom and Dad have things that have to be done and are a priority over some things that they may want.
5,Great coverage of the Southwest!,"Whoever the Let's Go person is for southwestern Ireland deserves a pay raise and a hearty handshake. I travelled from Cork to Limerick, and all along the way I was accompanied by witty, detailed, precise advice. It was as if I was taking a trip with a trusted and well-informed friend. Thanks Let's Go!"
2,You gotta be kidding?,"Who was it that wrote these reviews? Best friends? Sorry, but that's the notorious habit of too many 'indie' artists. This group is decent, musically, but there is little distinct originality about them at all. There are numerous artists that would be much better choices for this genre; Renaissance, Steeleye Span, Pentangle, and Fairport Convention come to mind instantly, which are clearly Magellaen's heroes. Simply, they sound like a neighborhood band who didn't sell their CD's very well even at live gigs. Worst of all is their friggin' name. There's a conflict with other bands using that name, and to get around it they changed the spelling, slightly, because they knew the other bands existed. Revolting. Reminds me of a bird's song, ""Cheap, cheap, cheap."" Maybe changing their name to Renaizzance would have been better..."
3,OK book for sources.,"If you are a parent trying to build a library of 22Q information, this one is not needed. Anyone with basic computer know how can get this information on their own easily (and free)."
5,Great 40s Vocal!,"Although the picture is brown and white on the cover, inside this group really offers some great sounds. Both slow and fast, they are much more commercial than one would guess coming from the mid and late 40s. The one by the Skylarks and Modernaires acapella with Buddy Clark takes you back to the Sunday afternoons of the past when the sun was bright and people were enjoying simple times. The one about Connecticut is a great theme. Other highlights are ""There's Something about a Hometown Band"" and ""I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night."" Great fidelity. Good harmony. They should do a Volume 2."
4,Remington Replacement Cutter,The Remington Replacement Cutter gives me a close smooth shave. This is the 2nd time I have ordered it. the price is very good. And I have no negative comments about this product.
5,Untitled,The product was an exact duplicate of the original cutters and screen for this razor and it functioned perfectly.
5,Finally! The Healer's War in Audio!,"If you listen to recorded fiction, do yourself a big favor, and download the Audible Audio Edition of The Healer's War!Having read this great book so long ago, I was surprised and pleased to find that a recorded version had finally been produced. Over the years, I have listened to hundreds of recorded books during my daily commute, and I have always believed that The Healer's War would make a terrific listen. It does.I was fortunate to have Ms. Scarborough as a teacher for a writing course I took many years ago. A side benefit was that I became interested in her work and read several of her books. They're all good reads, but in my opinion The Healer's War is her best. Vivid characters and scenes. Unvarnished honesty. Engrossing narrative. And it makes me glad the draft lottery number for my birthday was 300!"
3,"A hard one to judge, but to many a classic Butterfly","Callas despised beautiful voices, which is fortunate since she didn't possess one. There are times when her voice is so grating and peculiar that you have to take the record off, even though her interpretations are always mesmerizing.What you think about her voice per se will make a difference in this Butterfly. Cio-Cio San has been sung by sopranos like Tebaldi, Freni, and Price who have limpid, gorgeous voices. If that's your standard, you may find Callas too squawky and unlyrical. In addition, Gedda is a rather pallid Pinkerton with a voice too small for the part.But it's sitll Callas and with Karajan on the podium, that counts for a lot. This set is in mono, BTW, for those new to it."
5,An informative and short read!,What's great about this book is that it is a very quick read and very informative.
1,If I could give it a ZERO STARS I would,"OH MY GOD!!!! What a butcher job on some truly beautiful music from anime. The music from most of the anime in this CD is legendary...so is this for the absolute horrible remakes. What the HELL was this idiot trying to achieve?! This is an example of just how badly something can be done if the original artist isn't allowed to review an idoiots work before it's released. Wow...just, yeah...wow. It's that bad. No way to scrub it out of my memory now, I think I'll go get a lobotomy now."
1,Why butcher great music?,Don't let the titles of the songs on this album fool you: these ARE NOT the tracks you know and love from Yoko Kano. They are simply bastardizations of the originals. SO disappointing.
4,Great versions of already Great Songs,"Before purchasing this, you should note that these are not the original versions you are probably looking for. They are remakes. That being said, I think they are fantastically remade. While keeping to the jazzy roots from the originals, new elements have been added. I recommend you give them a listen with an open mind before leaving an awful review like most others did. 4 Stars for the Cowboy Bebop covers..."
5,"A Big, Beautiful Book","The perfect coffee-table book for fans of John Lennon and his music. Lots of lovely photos and illustrations, plus commentary from Lennon & those closest to him. Includes a very useful chronology & dscography. Highly recommended, as is the film upon which it is based."
1,Horrible.,"Take some bad carnival music, the banging of a stick on a pot to compensate for drums; wretched, unmelodic, and non-rhythmical guitars; horrible music composition; and some distant screaming vocals and you basically have this album. This has to be the worst black metal album I've ever heard...if black metal is even a title you'd want to grant this terrible excuse of an album with. It's sad to even call music. Save your money...don't get this album.Hopefully Black Funeral has some better stuff than this junk."
1,A Very Bad Game,"This is an incompetently executed video game, with obscure rules, many bugs, and ENORMOUS problems in translation. Contrary to another reviewer, it took me only about five minutes to discover this game is a (poor) translation of a game from Europe. Looking at the names of the people connected with it, I would guess it was made somewhere in Scandanavia. There's SOME humor value in the comically bad translations of the TV shows you will be producing, they really make no sense at all. However, the programmers made no effort to lip sync the animation and the soundtrack. The installation does not always refer to the program by the same name -- which I always take as a warning sign of sloppy programming. In the game itself, many of the pop-up message boxes appear on top of one another, obscuring important information. There are other bugs, and translation errors which made the game difficult to play, and quite tedious. I can't believe this game actually made it out of beta testing."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"It only took me 20 minutes to figure out this game was made in Europe, not in the US. The ""answers"" to this trivia game are wrong a lot of times (Chewbacca is a Wookie, not an Ewok) and they use the International title of films instead of the US titles (what we called ""12 Monkeys"" they call ""Army of the 12 Monkeys""), and when you are supposed to ""correct news articles,"" don't correct spelling errors, or you'll get them ""wrong"".After 30 minutes, I was just bored... it doesn't take long to memorize the answers to challenges in each category. I wish I'd researched this more before buying. Hopefully I can keep anyone else from making the same mistake."
1,"AWFUL, GARBAGE, NOT WORTH A CENT GAME",This game was the worst game that i have gotten! All it is trviva! AHHHHH! One stupid question after another...boring. This is a WASTE of your money so i advise you to NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE! NEVER EVER BUY THIS STUPID PIECE OF JUNK! Thank you for your time...GOOD NIGHT SEATTLE!
1,Star Dumb,I had some fun with Airline Tycoon so I thought I might have some fun with this. The description on the box (and above) is VERY misleading. This game is just awful.
3,Lifetime 1479 Basketball Goal,"The goal is great once it is assembled. The problem is with the instructions. There is a step with an incorrect parts list and a step with an incorrect picture. That is inexcusable for the number of basketball goals that Lifetime must sell. If you take your time and realize your instincts are better than the manufacturer's instructions, it is not that problematic. The assembled goal is great!"
3,"Lifetime 1479 Basketball Goal,","Be very patient or my advice is to just pay someone else to put this thing together. You do really need 2 people and at least 3 hours, the last steps getting the backboard with the adjustable height mechanism together were a little unclear in the directions and took us quite a bit of time. After all is said and done can't get the hoop level, it's kind of tilting up. Otherwise good value for the money and seems to be relatively well built and sturdy."
2,Disjointed movie,"The movie is about a woman, Amaryllis, whose dream is to become a professional ballet dancer, like her father was. But, she lives in a poor neighborhood in PR and once certain events take place (I won't give the movie away), she moves to the US to try to follow her dream. Instead, she ends up becoming a stripper and starts dating one of the customers of the strip club. She also meets a neighbor, who was a former university poetry professor, and who now is quite crazy. The movie was too disjointed and full of pointless characters (what is the purpose of the neighbor?!). The script was weak, the dialogue did not make sense and neither did the plot sequence. The plot did not present an opportunity for the characters to grow and somehow they did! This is one of those movies that an actor will regret having made.I like Roselyn Sanchez, and I know she is a better actress that what she showed in this movie. I hope she chooses the next movie better."
2,Adequate But Without a Clear Plot,"There were no scenes that were integral to the movie because ultimately it didn't have a coherent plot. Roselyn is beautiful and the dancing was amusing.The movie wasn't about anything in particular but it could have been about:1) Showing beautiful dancing2) Struggling for stardom3) Family troubles4) Running away5) Coping with tragedy6) Or something elseThe movie touched on a lot but failed to go deeply enough into any area to really fulfill its potential.The ending was particularly unsatisfying with the arrival of the son, the relationship with the doctor, ... and everything else left unresolved and unexplained. It seemed to be one inexplicable occurrence after another."
3,English Story,"I have enjoyed better many other stories. I'm british, so the american produced story line was not convincing. I suggest the producer sticks to a USA storyline for future productions."
1,Horoscope,Reads like a horoscope - you can read into each day whatever you like. This book was recommend by a friend but is not the type of book that I find enjoyable or useful.
5,So right on target its spooky!,"My girlfriend and I have been reading this book together, and having a lot of fun... we pick it up throughout the month and nine times out of ten it is right on target as far as her moods, etc. Add to this Ms Lichterman's wit and humorous anticdotes, and you have one of the best book purchases we've made in quite a while..."
4,a good read,The was a good read on coming to terms with emotions and commitment. The characters were very life like and you could really connect with the storyline.
2,An all out ILL Cd,"I give much props to Defari's debut cd ""Focused Daily"". A masterpiece of underground hip-hop at it's best. This cd should be heard by everyone who enjoys hip-hop. Over 17 tracks, you don't have to change A song. The 2nd track titled ""focused daily"" is featured with Dilated Peoples member EVIDENCE and is a perfect song to introduce one to this masterpiece of a cd. The track ""never lose touch"" has a rigid piano based melody to back up Defari's sensational lyrics. The best tracks which are hard to determine, are quite frankly ""bionic"", ""killin spree"", ""never lose touch"", ""focused daily"", ""yes indeed"""
4,A good start for a talented artist,"This has got to be one of the top hip-hop albums of '98. The lyrics are uplifting and true to life. The beats are on point too. Although no one track really sticks out as being a future classic, the whole album is tight. It is so tight, that I could not pick a best track off of this album. Thunder and Lightning was a little dissappointing, but the other tracks are all good enough for a person to have a different favorite everytime one listens to it. A must-buy for any fan of rap."
4,Its worth a listen,"To me the album had a strong beggining and ending, but a weak middle. Tracks like ""never lose touch"", thunder and lightning, lowlands anthem and bionic should be more than enough to convince you that Defari Herut has skills. Chalk up another victory for the liquid crew."
4,"LIKWIT CONNECTION IS PHAT, AGAIN!",Defari is just another example of likwit's talents. Focused Daily and Lowlands anthem's are phat tracks along with never lose touch. Defari show's his skills on his debut album this is a must get.
5,ILLEST!!!!!!!!!!!,"my favorite rap artist due to his ill lyrics , another reveiwer said to not skip any song, well you won't have to it's that ill. One of the Best rappers around."
2,Doesn't live up to expectations,"Perhaps later versions will be more intuitive to use and the plants more realistic but this one is neither. I found the user interface and help confusing and inadequate. Many frustrating hours were spent trying to learn it. My hope was that the program would provide a better idea for plant spacings and mapping of what I have. I had also hoped it would illustrate visually what groupings would look like before I purchased them. But when I entered the groupings I already have, what I saw was a badly rendered cartoon version of my plants. It is like looking at a badly done portrait and recognizing only elements of the person. Maybe a later version will be worth the time and effort to get the data entered."
1,Do Not Buy!!,"This is the worst written software I have ever bought! There is no valuable help built in and it is very restricted on the shape that you make your lot or garden. The toolbar has only a couple of buttons and you have to click on them every single time you complete a task, even if it's a repeat task. There also is no toll-free support. Very user unfriendly!"
2,Buyer beware!,"I NEVER write product reviews, but I just had to with this item. Be advised that (according to Sierra online support) you DO NOT get everything listed on the box--LandDesigner, PhotoGarden Designer and Garden Encyclopedia are the only products you'll receive software for. You WILL NOT get Designer Garden Library or Landscape Design Guide. I wrote support three times on this and the fact that I can't seem to go back to fix the windows I added to my house, and received curt, insufficient answers days after I submitted them. I'm considering sending this product back, but I haven't seen another with reviews that were much better. I'm very frustrated and wish you better luck with your software purchase."
5,An Adorable Little Tale,"This is definitely a book that I would want a young child to have. It is a very short story about two mischievous mice (a mom & dad), who find someone's dollhouse. They see that it is filled with nice things that they could use, like clothes, pots, & pans. They gather up some items to take back to their home, including a cradle for their babies. I especially love the color illustrations of the two mice. This would be a wonderful gift to add to a child's first collection of stories."
3,Jarabe de Palo misses inspiration on this album,"Being a big fan of Jarabe de Palo for years already, I was looking forward to hear the new album, 1m2. And to be perfectly clear and honest, I am quit disappointed. After listening several times, very concentrated and on my own, I am still looking for a reason why most of the songs seem to be so little appealing. Lack of inspiration perhaps? On former albums, like the last one Bonito, the songwriting seem to have had much more attention. Different sounds, different instruments, different guest appearances.Un metro cuadrado, one square meter. Unfortunately the songs do not go any further than that. You can buy all Jarabe de Palo records blindfolded, this one I would simply not recommend."
2,Deja Vu,I found this soundtrack to be a total disappointment. It sounded like a lazy ripoff of the Gladiator and Crimson Tide soundtracks.It's just a shame the soundtrack didn't live up to the movie's originality.
2,"Similar to ""Gladiator""","Klaus Badelt's soundtrack is good but some themes seem to be almost copied from Hans Zimmer's score to ""Gladiator."" Knowing that Zimmer is the overproducer, I wonder how much of the score is truly Badelt's original work and how much is ""borrowed."" If you own the soundtrack to ""Gladiator"" you don't necessarily need to own this one as they are much the same. I recommend buying Badelt's soundtrack to ""The Time Machine"" instead."
3,Party Music,"We purchased this CD for a ""Pirate party"" and the music was a great addition to the theme."
4,Doesn't quite live up to the movie,"I LOVED this movie. I loved it so much that I wanted to have my very own swashbuckling soundtrack.For swashbuckling, this soundtrack does not disappoint. The music is unique and you find yourself reliving the film all over again. When I watched the movie, I found that the music complemented the action perfectly and, in fact, even enhanced it.On its own, the soundtrack is still impressive, but I found it slightly repetitive. My husband remarked that he felt like we were listening to the same song over and over again. My other disappointment was that there was no rendition of the pirate's song (""Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me...""). I guess I was naively hoping for some full-cast version of the song.Still, the soundtrack brings back great memories of the movie and the excitement of a more romantic time."
3,I would have expected better,"Of all composers, I would have thought that Hans Zimmer would bring at least some more edge to this soundtrack. It's great, yeah, but not as good as I expected it to be. Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer should have come up with more themes to the score instead of just repeating the same on over and over again in each track. I also believe the soundtrack should be somewhat longer. The longest track of the whole cd is only four minutes and 48 seconds, while almost every other track is only two or three minutes. Although it is likable, I just don't think that this is the best work the composers can do for such a great film such as Prates of The Carribean."
5,"Amazing, Truly Amazing!","This soundtrack brings to life the movie in the comfort of your own home. Turn up the volume and enjoy, Klaus Badelt has created a masterpiece that could possibly rival Hans Zimmer's Crimson Tide theme and John Williams' Jurassic Park theme! Thumbs up all the way around. If you want to get a good soundtrack this year, this is the one to get. Nothing but good music here, with a theme that will uplift you and make you feel like swashbuckling a few pirates of your own!"
5,Totally flooring!,"All I can say is WOW! I have seen this movie twice since it came out and plan on seeing it at least once more in theaters. There is just this element that the music in the movie adds to the suspense, the drama, the romance, the piracy, everything! It totally makes this movie what it is. It's compelling and dramatic one moment, and then the next it's soft and sweet. It describes epic battles between good and evil without saying a single word. Everytime that I've seen the movie, I've hummed the celtic theme for days afterwards. The music is absolutely wonderful and this is definatly THE hottest soundtrack of the summer. You'll be missing out if you don't get this one!"
5,Holy Crap,"This soundtrack is awsome. I can't even explain it's not the typical soundtrack thats super slow, this one just keeps going and the melodies are just stuck in your head. I wanna listen to it over and over."
3,Hans Zimmer Jr.,"While there is no doubt the music for Pirates is excellent, it seems to me that Badelt spent way too much time studying Zimmer before he wrote this score. I actually thought it was Zimmer before I saw the CD. The main theme is almost a carbon copy of the main theme in Gladiator. While Zimmer uses the same themes in all of his scores (Gladiator, the Rock, Crimson Tide), we don't need another composer following his lead."
5,Arrrrrr-some,"I liked the movie and treat my car more like a pirate ship anyway, so this soundtrack was perfect for that. It always makes me want to watch the movie"
5,"A Pirate Score, no Doubt","This music is so pirate-like that it almost says ""Arrrgh"" as you open the case. And the sea breeze that gusts out from the music is almost real enough to put the spray in your face. If you didn't know what this was from, you would know it was a pirate movie. You feel the terror of those in battle with the undead pirates, and you sense the relentless of the pursuit of the pirate ships. Yet, there is the tenderness of the love theme as well. Great movie sound track."
5,"Welcome to the Caribbean, Love!","I am 13, and since the opening of the film in 2003, I LOVE pirates. When I bought the soundtrack a few months back, I had never realized just the intense brilliance of Klaus Badelt. Each piece is dramatically different, with intense moods, styles, and personality (I especially love ""He's a Pirate"" and ""Walk the Plank""). I love the movie (It's my favorite), but the music makes it even better. The best word I can use to describe it is ""rich"". Good ol' bumbling Cap'n Jack. :)"
5,Fun Fun Fun,"This score would best be described as a powerful musical romp. The movie was outstanding (Grammy award for Depp anyone??) and the score surely does it justice.It this score similar to a number of other action scores out there? - yes. Is it a touch cliché a times? -maybe. Is it a whole lot of fun? -Absolutely. This music captures so well the movie that it represents, but is a whole heck of a lot of fun as a standalone as well (I heard the score before seeing the movie).I suspect we'll be hearing parts of this score (especially tracks 2, 5, & 15) used in upcoming movie trailers for some time to come. I would recommend this CD without reservation to anyone who has seen the movie and wants to relive some of the best moments without waiting for the DVD (or seeing it over and over at the theatre) or to anyone who enjoys fun, loud, energetic orchestral music (but I would highly recommend seing the movie as well one or two (or ten) times)."
4,"Great, gr8 music but i wish it was longer","You will find that from the moment you play this cd, you will be swept out of your computer chair and into the Disney harbor where Pirates was filmed. The music is uplifting and packed with that righteous sense of adventure that seizes you in the film. I only wish that they had made it longer...I found myself dancing for about 10 minutes and I look to see that I am on track 5! If you are expecting a soundtrack with long, long scores that encompass the entire movie this cd may not be for you."
4,Great CD for Music Treasure Hunters,"The music of the Pirates of the Caribbean is fantastic. Very proper for a pirate movie. Lots of songs really lift the spirit of adventure up in you. Wish it had a little more ""historic pirate songs"" on it but I guess they can leave that to a follow up CD or something. Great album."
3,Excellent CD but a little heavy on the bass,"I agree with the previous reviewers except to warn new buyers that this CD is indeed ""over-produced"" when it comes to the bass. IMHO it really gets in the way in the listeners appreciation of the wonderful score."
5,My favorite soundtrack!,"This is my favorite soundtrack that I have ever bought, and I still listen to it all the time. I have read reviews where people complained about the repetative nature of the music, but I disagree that this is a negative feature. As a musician, I am fascinated by the subtle ways the main theme is changed throughout the sountrack such as changing tempos, beat patterns, and styles, to create an entirely new effect. I recommend this soundtrack to anyone who loved the movie!!"
4,Zimmer influence,"If you have listened to any of Hans Zimmer's work, this sounds quite like it.Listen to Barbarian Horde from Gladiator (about the middle of the track on to the end), and then listen to He's a Pirate. Almost identical themes used.I'm not complaining, as there usually isn't too much of a good thing.All in all, a decent soundtrack, something you feel like a pirate with and it makes you want to go out and swashbuckle something..."
5,Great music!,This is great listening music! This is great acting music!! All the members of my family enjoy listening to the soundtrack from the Pirates of The Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl. The children take advantage of the music and reenact their favorite parts of the movie. When you hear this music...there is no doubt that it is from Pirates of the Caribbean! It is definately going to be on a classic movie listening list.
5,mag-freakin-nificent,"I just watched POTC again this weekend and was truly astounded by the music as much as the movie. I can't recall an original score being so perfectly mated to a movie.For those of you thinking about buying the soundtrack you may notice that some reviewers mention there are some pieces that are left out, don't worry, buy the CD and you will find it quickly becomes one of your favorites.There are also reviewers who mention that ""the professionals"" rated the soundtrack very low. Think about how many times ""the professionals"" rated a movie, or album highly only to see it bomb, or the number of times ""the professionals"" panned a movie, or album only to see it become a success. My point is: if you like good music, ignore ""the professionals"". You will not be sorry. Even if you have never seen this movie you will enjoy the soundtrack, the music on it is good enough to stand on it's own."
5,PIRATES IS THE BEST,I love the pirates of the caribbean soundtrack - the music is amazing and i just want to listen to it all day!! The film is just as good and they go really well together!!
3,Good and bad...needs extended version,"On the good side, as the purpose of a score goes, I would give it a 5. I was on the edge of my seat while watching the movie based in no small part on the pulse of the music. So I had to then get the CD. It really helped make the movie the great entertainment it was.Now for the bad - the recording quality was TERRIBLE. I can't believe Disney let something that bad get into the open. And it was way too short. It REALLY needed one of the battle scenes in its entirety - there wasn't one track over 5 minutes from a 2 hour 23 minute movie. Hence my total score for the CD is a middle of the road 3.Disney can redeem itself by putting out an extended version of the score, better mastered than the first. I know that I will rush to buy it if they do! Hear that, Michael Eisner?"
3,Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack,"I am a huge pirates fan, i mean a seriously obsessed fan, and even with that i thought the soundtrack to the movie was a huge disappointment. Basically its the same thing repeated over and over again. In all honesty it does not have the right to bare the same name as the movie."
2,seems like the same song over and over again..,The song is good but I would just buy a single off of the internet and not this whole CD.
2,Oh please...this is a film score?,"First of all...this score was definitely not just overproduced by Hans Zimmer...it was practically WRITTEN by him. As one other reviewer already pointed out, some of the music is almost exactly the same as the battle music in gladiator...same style, orchestration, and feel. (that music incidentally was almost completely ""borrowed"" from Gustav Holst's 'Mars'from 'The Planets') Badelt has managed to create a catchy theme and has occasional moments of brooding, atmospheric music...but not a very impressive effort overall. Much of the music isn't even performed by live musicians but rather by synthesizers. Nearly all of the percussion is done on a computer, as are some of the brass instruments. I find this very dissapointing coming from someone who is the student of a well recognized film composer who ought to respect the music enough to let it be played by PEOPLE, not machines."
5,"Yo Ho, Yo Ho A Pirates Life For Me!!!","Thod one of my favorite soundtracks on the planet. It`s dark, huge and beautifull all in one time. And when you mix the music and the movie together it`s really a damn good job.This composer has really worked hard to get this soundtrack the way it is, and the theme for the pirates are just amasing. Enyone hwo dosen`t like this soundtrack is C-R-A-I-S-Y! And I meen it too. You just have to love it when you hear it."
4,!!!!,"Wow.... This soundtrack is just amazing. It's on my top 5 list. I didn't mind the titles of the tracks being messed up as much as I did the length. The length is extremely short compared to the lenght of the movie. Usually, composers have to cut down their music drastically to be able to fit it onto a cd, but this one seems like it was thrown together in a rush. Also, the Cpt. Jack theme ran a little too much throughout. All in all, this is a wonderfull soundtrack. The score really adds emotion to the movie. Let's hope Badelt lenghtens the score for the upcoming sequel!"
5,"Fabulous music, but where's the rest of it???","I love this soundtrack! It brings to vividly to mind the excitement and fun of this movie, but what happened to the rest of it? I've seen POTC several times and have made a point of listening to the score throughout the movie, and much to my disappointment, the soundtrack has been heavily edited. I don't think that there are any significant pieces that were omitted, but each track itself has been shortened. Considering the poularity of this movie, I was surprised that it took them a full two weeks to release the soundtrack, and then I had to go to 4 different stores to find it. Perhaps Disney underestimated the demand for a soudntrack and hastily put one together, butchering the music in the process. Let's hope that there will be another full-length version coming to stores soon!"
4,Excellent film score,"When I first saw this movie, I would have bet it was Hans Zimmer as I recognized the musical style, but it's one his mentorees who has done a fantastic job honoring his mentor, who overproduced this by the way. Even with so many bits reminiscent of Zimmer, you can see Badelt's style emerging. In the world of theatrical scores he is definitely one to watch.I have a vast collection of movie scores and this makes a fine addition and I'll look out for more of his work to add to the collection.There are powerful themes and more subtle music mixed in here for a nice balance. I really enjoy the use of horns in the main theme."
4,Stirring soundtrack,"If you like movie soundtracks and / or classical music you will enjoy this stirring theme. Its interesting to hear the music on it's own, then you realize how crucial it is to maintaining the tone of the film."
5,Awesome!!!,"This CD is all I expected and much more!!!! 15 songs that will transport you into the movie, you'll feel like you are a pirate in the Black Pearl travelling around the seven seas... very exciting!! the best song is the credit's one, it makes me remember the movie and the characters... ahhh... captain jack sparrow, will turner and all the characters are totally represented in the soundtrack and if you liked at least one of the characters of the movie, then you will also like this CD!!!! enjoy it and drool with the jack's song!!!! so sweetie and lovely!!!! lov that bloody cutie pirate!!! yah maties!!!The movie is a must see and this soundtrack is definitely a must buy!!!"
3,"An awesome score, but Badelt became a Pirate","I found this to be so powerful and so moving that it were as if I were actually on a pirate ship, sailing out to God knows where. The amazing crescendos are enough to blast you back to the 1600s where pirates ran amuck. The only quarrel I have with Klaus Badelt is there are miniscule references that made me believe Hans Zimmer snuck in through the back door to help write some of this music for him."
5,"A MUST for ""Pirate"" movie music fans","This is a magnificent score. It has a modicum of the traditional ""Pirate-esque"" convention of Bernstein (The Buccaneer) and Rozsa (Golden Voyage of Sinbad). And, while other film composers, Williams (Hook) and Debney (Cutthroat Island) have captured the swirling strings and strong brass, cymbals and tympani we have come to accept as the music that Pirates and other sailors carry in their souls, The Pirates OF The Caribbean not only has all of the above, but, it infuses rhythms and classical signatures from the actual time period. It also enough of a musical jab at the genre to be great fun. It's the type of score that makes you want to get on a ship with a sword in your hand and yell ARRR!"
5,Terrible recording of the world's best music.,I think Pirate music by Hans Zimmer is the greatest. But this is a terrible recording! I've never seen a CD recorded this poorly.It is as if the recording engineer was an idiot and set the recording level way to high so that it clips the signal in a very bad way on many of the songs. Especially during the exciting and emotional loud parts. It really sucks!I'd pay anything to get a good recording of these great songs!Does anyone have any ideas of how to get such?
2,Poor and cheap,"The Music is nothing but cheap synths-based Sh**... A great orchestral Score would have done the movie even better. There is only one good Theme heard in the score, dominated by the fiddles at the beginning and end of the score. It is a shame they did not let Alan SIlvestri do the job...But Jerry Bruckheimer does not know anything about good film music... anyway, if you watch the movie, just try not to pay too much attention to its music"
2,It wasn't bad....but it wasn't great either,"I know a lot of people will hate me for saying, I think this movie wasn't entertaining, wasn't funny, kept going on and on, and Orlando Bloom scared the crap out of me! He seemed more appealing in the Lord of the Rings series.(Which I highly recomend seeing, if you havn't)Its not like I hate this movie....but it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It seemed, to me, another one of those adventure shows that had practically no twists, a mooshy love story, a bunch of cheap action, unbelievable special effects, and a happy ending......oh brother...The only thing that I truly enjoyed about Pirates of the Carribean was Johnny Depp. Now he was awsome! He alone earned my extra star! I know alot of fans will hate me, but I had to lower the ratings for this movie....it just blowed. ^..^"
1,"Poor mastering, CD is defective","This CD is defective. When playing it on a PC, you get lots of clipping and artifact in the tracks. These clips ruin what is otherwise a great soundtrack. Do not buy this until Disney recalls it and releases one which is competently mastered. ...I have not tried it on a regular CD player yet, but as far as I'm concerned, any CD which does not play correctly in a PC is a defective CD.Again, do not buy this item until Disney competently masters it."
5,Like the Music Better Than the Movie,"I heard the soundtrack first not knowing what movie it was from and I immediately fell in love with it. It's exciting and powerful and makes you get these images in your head of actual pirates and their fancy. It puts you in the decade and within the very setting. It's so breathtaking and you can never get tired of it. The music presents all elemants, excitement, sorrow, mystery, and piracy expression. I absolutely love it and reccomend it to anyone who's searching for an outstanding classical soundtrack. It will definitely get your heart racing."
5,Modern Orchestral music at it's finest,"Even movie scores occasionally stand on their own as orchestral music. This is truly the case with the music from Pirates of the Caribbean. The music is moving and exciting. Even if you've never seen the movie, you can appreciate the rhythms, the melodies, the transposition. A fine piece of modern orchestral music."
5,One of the best,"This is a current day Masterpiece. Klaus Badelt can be seen using Zimmer's work (if you compare the Gladiator Soundtrack, certain tracks have similair or exact same tones and music that this track has), but that just makes this soundtrack better. if you loved the movie, you should love this."
5,Music good for the imagination,"Oh man! Listening to it right now... Not one song is bad. All of it so powerful. Definitely beats out the Gladiator Soundtrack! This music makes my imagination fly! If you like Hans Zimmer, then Klaus Badelt is your man! This ties with Con-Air as my favorite soundtrack."
5,Catchy rythmic melodies worthy of Disney magic,After seeing the movie I found myself playing the score over and over in my head so much that I had to see the movie a second time to hear it with its full orchestration.Fantastic. I couldn't wait to get the soundtrack CD!
5,PIRATES GOLD,"I am really enjoying the soundtrack from the Pirates of the Caribbean-- Curse of the Black Pearl."" I play it in my car all the time. The music is catchy and I find myself humming it thru the day.Everyone should put a little Captain Jack Sparrow into their day."
4,"If you like the Gladiator Soundtrack, you'll like this.","When watching the movie for the first time, I couldn't help but noticing how INCREDIBLY similar the music is to that in the film, Gladiator. Definitely a rip-off, but good, lively fun. And great to exercise to."
5,Utterly and Completely Amazing,"If you've ever dreamed of adventure on the high seas, daring sword fights, cannons fireing, and...undead pirates, this is the exact music that was probably playing in your head. It is powerful, very powerful, when it needs to be, and changes in tone accordingly. I have always loved music composed for movies like this, and this is by far, the best I've ever heard. So if you enjoy powerful, energetic music that fills your imagination, you'd love this soundtrack"
4,fast and easy,"I bought this for my son who is always in a hurry, but loves his brewed coffee. He is extremely happy with it because it is fast and yet the coffee tastes like it was made in a coffee machine. We have one of those instant hot water dispensers which makes this is a very convenient way to make coffee. It also goes through the dishwasher with no problem."
3,"""Coffee Catcher"" is a useless marketing gimmick","I don't know if I have a defective product, but the coffee catcher on my Bodum came slightly broken and was a real pain to put on and take off. The product demo on bodum.com makes it seem really easy to pull the catcher off the traditional filter, but for me I had to unscrew the whole contraption and then wiggle the holding piece all the way to the side before it would snap off. Definitely not something I want to do on a daily basis. And the coffee catcher consists of lots of tiny plastic wires that form a filter screen, but one of the wires came already broken and it pokes me when I try to remove the catcher. I'd imagine even more wires are going to break if I continue to use the catcher.I bought my Bodum when the coffee catcher version was cheaper than the non-catcher version. I'm happy that I can just throw away the catcher part and still use my Bodum the traditional way. Without the catcher, everything about the french press is fine."
4,"Coffe catch is great, but cools off fast","That pretty much sums it up. Also, it is a glass carafe, so I am just waiting for it to break. The coffee catch makes it the best glass carafe manual coffee press out there, in my opinion, but frankly, when the glass carafe eventually does break, I will probably 'upgrade' to the thermal one."
2,Did not work well for me,"I bought this after having some delicious coffee from a restaurant-sized version of this coffee press. Back home, the coffee that I produced wasn't so great and the press is a real pain to clean up afterwards with respect to the grinds that sit at the bottom. It is most certainly possible that I simply can't make good coffee at home. Nevertheless, we've stopped using it."
2,voolf in nyc,"just got in from a live Lincoln Center Mexican Divas Concert. A very (6 months) pregnant Magos Herrera opened, and honays, she soars, lifts her audience with the passion and feeling she obviously has for her audience, life, and Meheco. Ella Fitzgerald, Hugh Masakela, Grace Slick and Otis Redding mesmerized me like she did. Followed by the lovely and svelt Iraida Noriega who was too mellow after the lioness on the prowl for a kill, i.e, regeneration, Magos. I needed time to absorb what Magos took us thru. I'm hesitant to recommend CD, since I only bought it for Magos Herrera - a force of nature to be reckoned with LIVE! But what's life, if not to take a chance on something new and safe. Keep on keepin' on chillun!"
3,Uneven compilation.,"First 3 tracks are excellent( by Eugenia Leon, Lila Downs and Peruvian Tania Libertad. The rest varies from fair to unlistenable."
5,AN EXACT FIT FOR THE GRILL MASTER SERIES,"WORKS AWESOME, SAVED MY GRILL AND TRANSFORMED IT TO OUR PRIMARY COOKING APPARATUS. ALMOST THREW THE GRILL AWAY BUT AFTER WE SAW THIS ONE PIECE BURNER THE GRILL IS FULLY RESTORED. THANKS"
4,lifetime 1529,"Not a bad setup for the price. Assembly was not too difficult, and the quality ok, but backboard ""glass"" a little thin. No problems with it though. Easy rim height adjustment from 8' to 10' in half foot increments, great for my 7 year old."
2,"Uh...yeah, right, sure.","Thanks for dropping in, Laura, and singing your own praises. Otherwise, this book isn't very good at all, regardless of who wrote it. But if you do think it's amazing, you might be needing to read a few more books."
1,What a load of crap,"I always suspected this guy was a fake, and now it's all come out. Whoever wrote this book knows nothing about life on the streets. It's full of cliches and pure BS, and isn't interesting on any level. Steer clear of this fakery."
1,Waste of time,"I enjoyed LeRoy's other book, Sarah, even after it was revealed that the whole thing is fake. However, this ""book"" was not worthy of being published. I've seen better short stories come in the form of English assignments from 5th graders. It was a waste of time. Thankfully, it was a SHORT waste of time."
1,Double OUCH!,"What an extreme case of pee-pee envy, mixed up with a love of male genital mutilation. The woman who wrote this certainly has some serious issues, not the least of which deals with boundries and control."
3,An appetizer with no main course,"This author is given too many pats on the back and not enough kicks in the ass. This is a vanity publishing that hasn't been earned yet. Sure, he's a great young writer, but this novella doesn't justify being published by its lonesome, let alone with illustrations. Hopefully the promised forthcoming third novel will be long on story and short on the forewords and afterwords that just serve to remind us how precious and precocious the author is."
1,Let's not confuse things.,"Actually, I find the argument that these books should be judged simply on their own terms to be absurb, especially since the fabrication of JT Leroy was used to lure readers to the books in the first place. In other words, the books are fiction but the marketing device to get us to read them was a lie, pure and simple. So that's how these writings by Laura Albert should be understood--not as a stand-alone works of fiction but as a marketing tool to fool the public into buying them. If the hoax of JT Leroy shouldn't matter in regard to the books than why, I wonder, was it used in the first place?"
2,With my hand on my heart it's not the best,"Hype and praise breed expectation. I am unsatisfied. I am left scratching my head as to how this novella got published. Not nearly as strong as the stories in THE HEART IS DECITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS. The only redemption is the snail. Cute, clever. The rest is cliche after cliche. Street kids, heroin, dirty old men with bizarre fetishes. Been there, read that."
2,"Read Dennis Cooper instead, go to the source","It's just not a very good book, sorry. There's nothing in this book that Dennis Cooper and others haven't done better. Even as a Copper pastiche it still falls way short of the mark.As for Laura Albert, this kind of writing/hoax seems to be a typical American phenomenon: girls, who can't get over the fact that they weren't born as boys. They invest a lot of energy to ""re-invent"" themselves as young males (who never really become adult men) and at the same time reduce their envy by putting boys down (just like in the case of ""Anthony Godby Johnson""). Make them suffer all kinds of abuse, turn them into some weak and miserable beings so that you don't have to envy them anymore (it's therefore only logical that Jeremiah has to wear girl's clothes) - that's it, there's nothing more to say actually. People, who still believe that JT LeRoy is a 25 years old man, should maybe ask themselves why they want to believe it."
1,If this is genius. . .,"then Carrie Fisher is Meryl Streep, Shirley Manson is Janis Joplin, Michael Pitt is James Dean. . .right, Laura? Still up to your old gender-bending promo tricks it seems. The only genius connection of this sad waste of trees is to the title of the book by the literary cheerleader who helped foist it on the world by editing it, Dave Eggers. And, speaking of genius--as in HAL 9000-- ""You've got a problem, Dave."""
1,Can't give it a ZERO...,"Spend your money elsewhere. There's not a single original idea or voice in any of it, completely ripped off from better writers.Interesting someone would give these books such high ratings without even reading them first. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm..."
1,weird boring book - too short,"This ""book"" is all of 81 pages long, and took me maybe a half-hour to finish. The pictures are plain and have a weird page made of wax-paper covering each one. I was half-hoping for some explicit sex scenes like in The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things (one of JT LeRoy's other books) that I would be aghast at (but secretly pervertedly a little turned on, haha) but the only thing that came close to it in this book was an awkward enema scene, which was about as erotic as a plate of cold mashed potatoes. All in all, a big waste of money on a really short story that was lame, and left me feeling disillusioned, frustrated, and sad."
1,"Do Not Read This Book Or Any Of ""His"" Other Books.",The writing is terrible and I find this exploitation of child abuse particularly offensive. Ms. Albert is someone who should not be writing or breeding for that matter.
3,Lacks LeRoy's usual emotional punch.,"This story lacks the emotional punch that his other stories have. The storyline is fairly predictable, and it's too short for the reader to really develop a connection with any of the characters involved.The writing is beautiful as always, and the illustrations are as well. There are wonderful moments along the way, like Oliver's misunderstanding ""mesclun"" for ""mescaline"", and the fight at the end.While I was a bit disappointed in HAROLD'S END after reading SARAH and THE HEART IS DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS, I'm still glad that I got this book. (Supporting small presses is a good thing!)"
3,Wonderful if you only need to use it once!,"My sister raves about this product and she treated me to a bottle - just purchased from the hair salon. I used it and thought I had found something that would make my life so much easier - but the next time I went to use it it was empty. I thought maybe it was just me but after reading a few other people's reviews, I think it's just something wrong. Too bad."
2,TOO LITTLE PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY,"I was excited to try this product after reading some dry shampoo reviews. However, after just one use, the can will no longer produce any product and seemingly is empty. I followed some suggestions from Amazon to use short, quick bursts of the dry shampoo but it did not seem to help. I hesitate to try this product again."
3,Disappointing,My hair was left feeling dried out and mucky. I use only in extreme emergencies. My hair looked anything but clean or freshened.
1,One use & out!,"I purchased this product based on some positive reviews here & other sites. I used it ONE TIME and I didn't over spray - I used a small amount. The next week, I tried to use it and it & nothing would come out. I cleaned the sprayer etc. but nothing would come out. It felt empty - it was just gone.I did see another review that mentioned this but I thought it was a fluke. I informed the seller and his reply was basically ""too bad for you"" and nothing else. Maybe the container I received wasn't full in the first place. Who knows?Don't buy this product. One use for $20 is not worth it."
3,The Merry Pilgrimage: How Charlemagne Went on a Pilgrimage,"The Merry Pilgrimage is a translation of an old French poem/epic in story form, of which critical material has been drawn upon by various scholars. The story itself concerns how Charlemagne of the Hoary Beard and his Twelve Peers make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem where they obtain holy relics and then journey to Constantinople where King Hugo the Strong is made a vassal of Charlemagne. This is an extremely rare account which once was sung throughout Europe of Emperor Charlemagne and his chosen companions, such as Roland the Brave, Turpin the Archbishop, and Oliver the Wise who struck blows for Christendom by their mighty deeds. It has black and white illustrations throughout, and though a slim volume, and perhaps much of it fable, shows the wit and charm of this legendary King of the Franks. It is a notable addition to any serious collector or descendant (as I am) of the might and wisdom of the Great Carolus Magnus."
4,Passionate,"Valerie Kirschenbaum has written a richly illustrated and well researched volume on the changing face of writing and book publishing. Her passion and interest for the subject of combining illustration and color to enhance meaning of the written word come through brilliantly in her prose.Although I cannot agree with Valerie that plain text publishing will soon become (or should become) obsolete, I am impressed with the argument she makes for an enhanced style of information presentation."
5,A Wonderful Combination of Art and Literature,"This is much more than a coffee table book. It is a wonderful combination of art and literature. Definitely a ""rainy day magic"" book to browse through and take in each wonderful picture and idea.The magnificent color and fonts add emphasis and interest to the material. The illustrations make you want to share the book with your grandchildren and see their excitement as each page is turned. It's done in such a manner as to make you want to linger on each page.However, it is hard to get by the old convictions and preferences (and doing it the easy way) of publishers. I'm afraid there will be few books like this. Format and predetermined style will be hard to overcome.As a lover of books and words, I applaud anything and everything that will get children (and adults) to experience the pure enjoyment and adventure of books.Good luck, Ms. Kirschenbaum. You are truly an imaginative and inventive teacher."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK,"I am not an educator or a historian as some who have written reviews are.I am simply someone who loves and respects the written word. As such, I find this book full of intriguing and inspiring ideas and it is quite simply the most beautiful visual feast I have ever owned.Each page is to be read, digested and enjoyed. Do yourself or someone you care about a favor and get this book. You will guarantee yourself a lifetime of enjoyment.This book belongs on a shelf with your dictionary, thesaurus and encyclopedia. In other words, it is something you will refer to again and again and aqain."
3,It's So Hard to Say Goodbye,"Kirschenbaum's computer-generated tome is certainly a visually arresting work, and it comes with a provocative if dubious proposition: if love of learning and reading is to be dissemenated to the rising generation, it must be done so in non-traditional ways. The old venues to knowledge and pleasure provided by books are archaic. This is a brand new world. We must either adapt all our vocations and aspirations to the new ways or risk losing them altogether.I am not sure I buy the idea. Perhaps it is the old Ludditte in me which loves the perfection of the book and automatically rejects any innovation. Wonderful as laptops and such are, there is no way to have the same sort of symbiotic relationship with them that one can have with a book. Nevertheless, mossbacks like myself may have no say in the ultimate path of knowledge.Kirschenbaum has certainly provided an attractive and interesting parry in this debate.Worth a look."
2,So bad it's actually pretty funny...,"Mercilessly self-congratulatory, ""Goodbye Gutenberg"" takes a potentially interesting premise and proceeds to beat readers over the head with the author's self-proclaimed brilliance and prescience. Before you even crack the cover, you get: ""How a Bronx Teacher Defied 500 Years of Tradition and Launched an Astonishing Renaissance."" And yes, Kirschenbaum is writing about herself. (I wonder: Is it possible to give oneself the Nobel Prize?)Kirschenbaum seems to have never seen a copy of a graphically oriented magazine such as ""Wired."" What's conceptually bleeding-edge to her is daily reality to others. ""Gutenberg"" isn't new or even novel, let alone ""astonishing.""This isn't a book. It's a one-woman marketing campaign."
4,An old favorite,"I first saw this movie in the theater and loved it then. It's been great to see it again as an adult. I don't see the infidelity as being glorified, if anything it emplifies how a forbidden affair is just a sad shadow of what a real love relationship could be. This movie shows how each person changes and how the other has missed out on so much of that person's life and how they are only allowed just a glimpse of each other. They aren't able to be available to each other during difficult times or take part in any of the joyous events.None the less this movie is able to pull off a very romantic ,and on some strange level, a very committed relationship. Don't we all have that person in our lives whom we don't get to see very often that rejuvinates us. Hopefully those relationships are plutonic but in this case it's not and makes for a great story."
5,Wonderful Story,I wish we had more well written stories like this. It's more than romance. It's a glimpse of how we continue to evolve through life. The great and versatile acting brings you deep into the story.
3,Good movie but not as good as I remember,I saw this movie many years ago and absolutely loved it. It doesn't hold up quite as well as I hoped but it is still enjoyable. And the opening song - Johnny Mathis and someone whose name I can't think of - is still great!
2,is there anything more tiresome than social satire 30 years later?,"some stories date really badly, and this film based on a major broadway hit of a few years before is one. all the social satire of looking back is predicated on a 1970s POV, and that view is in itself so skewed that practically none of it is either funny or relevant. decent enough work by alan alda and ellen burstyn, but the writing and directing cant be compensated for."
1,Disturbing,"I may have once considered this movie to be somehow romantic, like so many other reviewers. But, that would have been during my single days or during the years of marriage that I thought were happy and stable. However, after having my world turned upside down by infidelity this movie just serves as a disturbing reminder of the weak emotional nature of so many people who lack the discipline to be true to the fidelity they vowed on the alter. Now I have to wonder if total reconsiliation is really possible or if people predisposed to this behavior are destined to seek happiness outside of marriage at any cost. I was starting to believe that couples who survive infidelity can have stonger, happier relationships than they ever experienced with each other before the affair but this movie casts doubt on the cheaters - can they ever really be content with their spouses? It's a sad reflection on the human condition. Yes, bitter sweet indeed."
1,An adulteress couple involved in a superficial relationship,"The fine acting aside, I really hate the subject matter of this film. It primarily involves itself with the superficial adulteress yearly affair of a rather selfish man and woman. What it fails to adequately address is the moral and physiological implications of ""cheating"" and how it not only affects the spouses of the people having the affair, but the cheaters themselves. As you begin to justify something as potentially devastating as infidelity, what other moral values might you be able to ""overlook"" in order to get something that make you ""feel"" good?Although this movie has its moments, I just can't get past the glorification it gives to adultery, to enjoy it."
3,Bad Subject Matter,"It kind of glorifies adultery, which I hate. It's fairly long, dialogue is snappy and well-paced. Writing's not bad. It's saving grace is the soundtrack with Johnny Mathis and Jane Olivor. It's the kind of movie that you watch once then let it collect dust, at least it was for me."
5,One of my favorite movies ever!,"When I realized that many of my lady friends had never seen this movie, I bought it from Amazon.com and had a ""girls' afternoon out"", with a bottomless pitcher of Sangria and loads of popcorn. We are all still talking about what fun that afternoon was, and we vowed to do it again with another classic movie. I just love that I can go online to Amazon and usually find exactly what I want, and it's affordable. Thanks!"
5,"Prompt, pleasant, professional - A 5 star seller ! Thanks !","All a person can ask for is the item they purchased in new ( if advertised ) or good condition...A simple, honest transaction to make the internet a fine marketing tool and shopping experience. Thank you for making this just that !!!"
5,SAME TIME NEXT YEAR,"An excellent motion picture that shows not only that it's possible to love more than one person at a time, but also how people grow and change their values and perspectives over time. Buy it. You'll like it."
5,The movie that really made me fall in love with forbidden love,"The age-old story of the long standing affair between otherwise engaged people, but with a twist or two...or three! No matter the year in which this movie is set or was made, it is timeless, sweet, and shows you a different side of illicit love affairs. Alda and Burstyn are excellent, very funny and have an incomparable chemistry. I adore this film and would watch it over and over again. In fact, I already had the VHS when the DVD came out, and I bought it immediately!"
5,Great Entertainment! Loved it!,"If you liked ""Bridges over Madison County"", you will love this video. A most unlikely love affair. Great romantic comedy. Alan Alda at his best!"
5,A true love story.,"I believe this movie teaches the viewer that real love can stand the test of time, and about true unconditional acceptance of your partner. It is a true classic in my opinion."
3,Same Time Next Year,I was not impressed that the DVD i purchased was not compatible to any AUSTRALIAN DVD sets or computers maybe next time AUSTRALIAN people purchase these DVD's you do not sell them.
4,"Touching, Funny, Heartfelt","From the moment the Johnny Mathis song ""The Last Time I felt Like This"" begins, you'll be hooked. This is a marvelous character study of two people who take a ""time out"" from their real lives and connect every year... through good times and bad. You will laugh with the abusurdity of Alan Alda's tendency to ""not think things through"" and marvel at Ellen Burstyn's incredible performance as she grows through the years. I defy you to remain unmoved by the ""hippie"" scene, or to not laugh about Alan's wife's referred-to antics in the bad and good stories the couple relate to one another each year. By the way, the song is avilable on ""The Best of Johnny Mathis""... Wonderful!"
3,"Good movie, poor dvd",I watched this movie several years ago and it is still a funny sweet love story. The problem was the dvd was poor quality and it skipped and messed up throughout the movie. Nothing any more aggravating than that.
5,"Touching, sentimental, fun - what you wish all love could be",A wonderful story of how love changes yet still continues to grow. Two unlikely people meet and begin a friendship and love affair that stands the test of time. Ellen Burstyn and Alan Alda seem made for their roles. They love and share through the best of times and the worst of times - you will laugh out loud and cry - and wish for a friend and lover as true to you as they were to each other. I recommend it highly. Enjoy!
5,"Lovely Movie, Reflects Love in its True Essence",I've been looking for this movie since a while here in Dubai where I live. Finally found it on Amazon and booked it pronto!!!! That was the best thing I did in recent times. Amazing portrayal of emotions on screen. A timeless Classic of modern times.
4,Soul Mates,"If you've ever found your soul mate, and for whatever reason couldn't be with them, you need to see this movie. It's about two people who meet by chance (as soul mates do), but they are both happily married - to other people. George and Doris love their spouses and don't want to leave, yet they have found a soul connection in each other that they can explain nor deny. So they meet at the same place, on the same weekend every year. They each assist the other in dealing with obstacles in their lives and they work through the guilt and limits of their relationship. No matter how each of their lives change (mostly Doris') and how different their lives are, they still love each other for who they are. In the beginning it can seem kind of cheesy and the characters can be a little annoying, but throughout the movie you will seem them grow to their full potential."
5,Excellent movie!,"Great movie... know I will enjoy it over and over again! The acting is superb, the script excellent, and t he parts sensitively portrayed. Primo!"
4,"Beyond ""insightful""","Richard McLean has truly experienced what is the toic of my interest: schizophrenia.He takes us on the journey.We are closer to the experiences than when we watch a uncercover operation as depicted on television such as ""NCIS!The only drawback is that the experiences take place in Australia.We may need to find another such personal experience revelation that occurred in the USA."
2,Nostalgia for the Superman fans!,I got this because I am a Superman fan. Saw this when I was a teenager and didn't quite remember it that well. Looking at it on DVD made me remember why I didn't remember it that well. It would be far better to rent this from either Netflix or Blockbuster than to spend money.
4,Haha!,"I am a major fan of Superman, and when I first heard they did a Superboy series between 88-92, being born in 1987, I shit myself. Literally, shit shot out my ass and I rocketted through the roof...nah, just kidding. Anyway, I've been trying to aquire the first season ever since, and finally found it on here for a great deal of $7.29. I've already finished it. It was corny, in that 80s tv kind of way, but a fairly good representation considering the time-period. I look forward to seeing the remaining 3 seasons!"
2,SUPERBOY,"ITS AMAZING THAT BETTER ACTORS AND OR WRITERS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND FOR THIS SERIES. IT IS POORLY DONE, AT LEAST THE FIRST SEASON. SOME REVIEWS HAVE SAID THE LATER SEASONS ARE MUCH BETTER. IT DOESN'T EVEN COMPARE IN THE LEAST TO SMALLVILLE OR TO THE WORST OF THE SUPERMAN MOVIES."
4,Superboy Flies,"I had not seen Superboy before purchasing the DVD set, so I had no idea what to expect. It turned out rather well. The actors started the series somewhat lacking in confidence, but that changed during the course of the season. The pilot seemed to be out of order, too. I enjoyed the location scenes since I lived in the Orlando area around the time the series was shot so I could recognize locations. Bonus material included in the set discussing the production of the series was interesting. I am looking forward to the rest of the series becoming available."
5,A rough start leads to a great show!,"Don't give up on this one, the first half a dozen episodes are beyond B rated. I mean you literally see the string from the crane as Superboy flies and the dialog is almost as bad as the actors. But laugh those off, they change Superboy actors later on and the other actors learn how to act. The show gets better and better until you can't wait for season 2 to emerge! Besides, you can make it a game, see who can spot the string the most times!"
2,"VERY ""CHEAP"" LOOKING SHOW!","For a show that was produced in 1988/89, I was amazed at the overall poor quality of it. It looked like a mid 70s ""Afternoon Special"". Film was very grainy and production values were lousy. The 1950's Superman was even better, quality wise. Acting was OK, guest stars good. Bottom line: if you're thinking of buying this.....PASS IT UP!"
1,Bad quality and cheap looking !!!,This series has a very amateur and low budget look about it. Invest in the animated series or Lois and Clark series for quality entertainment for your dollar.
2,"This show was absolutely horrible, but it was a Superman (Superboy) adaptation.","I have no sentimentality or fondness for this show. It possessed poor acting, bad writing, wretched effects, and by far the worst pair of Lex Luthors one could ever imagine.That said, it is Superman -- well, Superboy, which I am compelled to watch and analyze. Yes, I will purchase this DVD set.In the show's defense, it improved in all aspects with each progressive season, but considering how horrible the first season is, that is not high praise."
5,Superboy is Super,"Superboy is awesome! Some fans believe that the show started a bit slowly and then really started picking up steam after the first season. I definitely agree that the show kept getting better and better, but Season 1 is definitely very entertaining and worth checking out. Too bad Smallville copied the idea..."
3,Starts a bit low,"I didn't remember the first episodes of the First Season as I started watching the Second when it was broadcasted on Spain.But now I see that despite Iyla & Alexander Salkind produced this and the movies in the 80's the visuals are real cheap,acting mediocre,villains and plot very weak.Flying effects are normal altough sometimes u see the image is superimposed.Some guests starts adds some quality but result is average.I hope WB releases the 3 restant seasons which are much better.Some interesting episodes are Hollywood(time machine to 1939),Succubus(a creature that steals energy from the young to keep live)and Luthor Unleashed(where we know how he loses his hair)."
3,"Good, but the best is yet to come.","The stories are decent, but they do get better in the coming seasons. This is the first time I've seen season 1, I started watching from season 3 back in the early 90's. Overall the special effects are good & writing are also good, but I can't wait for season 2."
5,"Besh o droM ""Gyi!""","...one of my FAVORITE examples of the ""Gypsy Punk!!!""the Gal that does the Vocals does a superb job atmaintaining the ""Traditional"" Voice! best Musiciansand Arrangement!break out the Vodka, Rock & Roll!""Weeeeeee, Yeahhhhhh!!!"""
1,An utterly condescending piece of garbage,"I read through this book hoping to learn the ins and outs of investing. Instead, all I got was an assortment of trite sayings and poorly organized - almost to the point of being random - definitions. The few - and I say few - helpful pieces of information in this book come with the air of condescension; the writer spends most of her time pampering the reader with her own suggestions for a successful investing career, instead of providing adequate information for the reader to make an informed decision. In short, the title of the book isn't just for laughs - the writer does assume that you are a COMPLETE IDIOT. Anyone with an ounce of intellectual self-respect and a desire to LEARN about Wall Street can find better literature elsewhere."
4,I think they meant it when they said complete.,"This is not just a how-to book. Or strategy book. But a complete description of what you are dealing with book. This has all the technical descriptions and examples. This book also has, ""Did you know this"", gray boxes. For example:"" Bet you didn't know. More certificates of deposit mature in April and October any other time of year.""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Managing Your Money, 4th Edition"
4,Worth the penny,"You can get this one for 1 cent + p&p, but it's worth WAY more than that. Several stories are the sort to stay with you. (To be honest, one or two didn't grab me -- but with a collection you have to know not every story is going to grab every person in the same way!) Still, a great collection. And it doesn't seem ""dated."""
4,princess lovers will love this,"my granddaughter is enamored with the princesses. so, she loves this game. however, thinking this game is more suited to a slightly older child. granddaughter is 5. she played it w/ an older cousin, and they had a blast, but the cousin kindof prompted her on what to do in places."
4,Great for preschoolers,"I got this for my 4 1/2-year old daughter for Christmas. She loves it! Once we got the DVD remote set up to use with our player, she was set. She plays it solo most of the time but I have played it with her and so has her older brother. The pieces are those cardboard-type pieces that slip into a plastic base, but in order to store them you have to take them apart each time. All instructions are on the DVD - no booklet. The thing I like best is that the questions are read aloud for her, thus I don't have to be with her constantly in order for her to successfully play the game."
2,Remote doesn't work,Tried to get the included remote to work on 3 different dvd players. It wouldn't set up properly on any of my dvd playersThe same questions are asked over and over again and it's highly frustrating. Followed directions that are on the games website to try to fix the question repeat problem but nothing works.A complete waste of money.
3,Could have been better,Sometimes the movie loops and asks the same questions over and over again. Not enough variety of questions.
4,She loves it,"I bought this game for my 5 year old daughter, and she loves it. She thinks it's wonderful to play along with her favorite princesses. The biggest problem I see in it, is that it is a major test at honesty, since you don't actually have to guess at the answer before they tell you the answer on screen."
2,Disney Pricess Game,We purchased this game for my 6 year old daughter for Christmas. The remote control did not work from the start (I hear this happens all the time). The DVD game is scratched. I do not recommend buying this game.
3,useful,"It's useful for keeping a child busy, but definitely not for younger children, and not for kids who aren't too literate in dvds."
2,Fun but Frustrating if you are an adult!,"I read all the reviews before purchasing this on Amazon for my 5-year old daughter for Christmas 2008. The whole concept is really fun. You have all these ""trivia"" type questions they ask about the princesses in the disney movies. They have movie scenes and seek and find stuff. It is quite fun. My daughter thinks she is amazing at this. Probably because IT DOES NOT ROTATE THE QUESTIONS. The SAME questions come up time and time again. That is the frustrating part. If they would only have a shuffle to it the game would not be so boring. We have to act like we don't know some answers because in truth we have seen the same ones over and over again. The remote will NOT work. I wouldn't mind this as much if the game was less repetative. i only paid $[...]. I wouldn't pay more than that."
2,Disney Princess Dream Jouney DVD Game,This is a very poorly written game. The repetition involved for the age level asked for is beyond boring. We did not use it more that twice; two agonizing times.
2,Mouth Spray,I used this brand for years and had trouble finding it in local drug stores - So ! I deided to order on the internet - Product arrived fine BUT ! Since I have been using it at least fifteen per-cent of the spray tubes leak - Quality control needs improvement at both the parts and manufacturing process
2,Poor quality,"I was lucky to find this cracker jar in a store alongside the Anchor hocking 1 gallon barrell jar so I could compare. The cracker jar's lid is terrible. Too soft, thin, flexible. You can tweak or contort it with one hand, so how long you can get a good seal is in question. In fact, one of jar lids allready did not screw down well. Like paper. Barrell jar lid looks similiar unless you look close but it is signifigantly stiffer, plus the handle is handy. Barrell lid is useable quality(barely) but still not as good as lids from 1980's. Of course they may down grade this lid soon also. Perhaps in 2011. Be careful."
1,"Lid leaks liquid all over, not suitable for even dry food storage or the kitchen","Not suitable for the kitchen. Not airtight so it won't keep food fresh & if you put grain in these, you will be guaranteed bugs. I bought two of these for picking up raw milk. The lid is the worst I have ever come across and in transportation, milk spills all over the outside of the jar and the bag, making a mess. It is nearly impossible to pour and spills every time. Even after I have dried the jar and I'm returning it to the fridge, the lid is so bad that it drips milk all over, causing a circle of milk around the bottom of the jar, soiling the shelf of the fridge. The glass itself is fine. Everything else does not work, causes a mess & wastes good milk. This is only suitable for non-liquid and purposes other than anything to do with food.Anchor Hocking 85725 Cracker Jar (Pack of 4)"
5,Real Life Strategy,"One criticism is that the game is very fast moving, but so are real life markets. What is today's hesitation is tomorrow's opportunity lost.I was a little skeptical buying a game called Day Trader - because I frown upon such market practises. However, the game isn't about day trading...You use options and futures, as well as standard long/short transactions...You can conduct business in the three major global financial centers (NY, London and Tokyo), and trade currency, stock indexes, and bonds (T-bonds, Gilts and JGBs).Even better, you have a selection of scenarios to play (such as Internet booms, etc), where you have a selection of relevant stocks to trade in. For example, with the internet boom you can play with ETrade, Yahoo, etc.With the exception that things do move really fast, I think it an excellent game on the whole."
2,Not what I was expecting.,"This is a game which goes through real time. You are able to influence the market using your lawyer as well as the press agent. A spy for influencing the prices of stock is available as well for espionage of certain companies. It may be a fun game for some but I found the game to be challenging even at the slowest speed. For me to really think about a stock this should have been a game which should have been turn based as opposed to real time. You essentially have 60 seconds to make a decision about something before the market closes for the day. In other words, just save your money for something else."
3,One of my 4 year old's favorites,"When her brothers are napping and she gets to pick a movie, my 4 year old daughter regularly requests this movie. She's watched it at least 8-10 times. Story is decent and not as bland as many Barbie movies. Worth $10."
5,Barbie Fans,"My girls love anything by the Barbie series. Sometimes I think there are some scary parts, but it doesn't seem to phase them."
5,Peek a Prize Balls,Purchased the balls and rings to go with the SmartCat Peek and Play Pet Toy Box and oh my goodness both cats began playing with it immediately. This was the best toy ever.
1,BE CAREFUL,"This is my cat's favorite toy...but I would not recommend getting it for your cat if he/she tears into them like mine does. My cat loves these so much he bites and destroys them - but unfortunately he ate a piece of one, and $3500 in vet bills later, he's slowly recovering from the surgery to remove it. If your cat is the type that will bite this toy, take it away!"
1,CAREFUL,"Be VERY CAREFUL! Watch your cat when he/she plays with these balls. The type of material it's made of is not safe! My cat was walking around with one of the balls stuck on her tooth. She was able to bite into it and it was stuck on her tooth. Thank God I was home. I could just imagine if I wasn't. BE HOME AND WATCH YOUR CAT WHEN HE/SHE PLAYS WITH THIS. Or better yet, just don't purchase it, there are other cat toys that are safe. THIS IS NOT SAFE."
3,My Cats Have No Balls,"I bought these balls for my two large Bengals who act more like dogs. After all, how can you argue with the cost of about one dollar per ball? Initially they played and batted them around and even carried them around in their mouths. One cat is fat and stupid and the other is smart and muscular. However, they both tired of them and eventually lost them somewhere (I have searched and searched. I cannot find them!). In the end, they are just silly rubber balls. They did fit into my 'trackball' toy, but these cats just pull them out within minutes. They are a nice simple cheap toy and only you know if your cats will like them. I suspect if I can find silvery or shiny balls, my cats would enjoy them more. I do have to ask - can Bengals have innate ADHD?"
5,Toys,the cats love this more the box it came in and the peek a prize balls last both in fun and durabilit.
4,If you like Black Sabbath then you should listen to this.,"The first time I heard Pentagram it was this record, and I was sold directly. The sound is doomy with the singers high voice, somewhat false but that just adds to the great music. It sometimes reminds of the desperation that could be heard in some of the Ozzy-Sabbath tunes.This is a must for doom-music fans and Sabbath fans"
5,"Relentless, indeed...","It just doesn't get any better than this for Sabbath-influenced fuzz-metal. If you worship the first four Sabbath albums (and who doesn't??) then you really need to own this one. Stylistically, Pentagram manages to reproduce the older Sabbath sound without making a feeble copy of it. (The production is cleaned up a bit, and you should really hear the vinyl edition for some heavy sludge.) The first lp has the same sound as ""Sabbath Vol. IV', as if your head is right next to the speaker cabinets.Every time I whip this thing out, I have to play it all, and usually not just once! Tracks like ""The Ghoul"" and ""All Your Sins"" have never been equalled by any other Sabbath-influenced band in my book, and I have consistently blown the minds of everyone I've played this gem for. And ""Sinister"" is by far the most convincingly creepy metal song ever.If you don't own this, and none of your friends do either, get it. You'll be the envy of them all."
2,I was so surprised.....,"I selected this book because I love the wildlife of Southern Africa. And I love them alive and thriving. The large format photographs are beautiful. However, I was shocked at the very pro hunting text written by Peter Godwin. The contents of the book revolted me and I am embarressed to even own this book. It is full of pro-hunting propaganda and the belief that these beautiful creatures need to ""pay their own way"" by having wealthy tourist hunters pay large summs to kill them to the brink of existence. Sorry, not my cup of tea."
4,All Disney All the Time,"Mr. Smith is giving, nay, imparting so much of his knowledge to us. This 2nd update of his original knowledge base is great. Just wish there were more pictures. Maybe a cd or dvd with the next one? This is a MUST HAVE for any Disney fan (also, be sure to read the new bio from Neal Gabler, a perfect detail of the Man that started this all)!"
4,Some more pictures and colours,"I was probably too much impressed by the pictures in the Grant's Encyclopedia of WD Animated Characters, so even if this Disney A to Z encyclopedia is my bedside book for the moment, I would like to see more pictures of actors or animated characters and more color.I believe it would cost a few dollars more but for a fistfull of dollars, Clint Eastwood and I would buy it.The containt is however very interresting; it is my bedside book now."
5,Great Disney Resource,"This encyclopedia by Disney archivist Dave Smith has everything you would want to know about Disney's films, theme parks, television shows, and more. At a length of over 600 pages, this book overflows with information, most of which one might wonder why anyone would need to know. Questions such as ""what Disney film was released on October 3, 1927?"", ""what Disney film stared Sean Conery before he landed the role of James Bond?"", and ""what stage show played at Walt Disney World's Tomorrowland Theater starting in 1984?"" are all answered in this book, along with literally thousands of others. This book is a great resource for any Disney fan and a fascinating look at the evolution of the Walt Disney Company."
3,A must when hiking the West Coast Trail,"I attended a UofC Outdoor Centre slideshow on hiking the West Coast Trail. The presenter had hiked the trail 11 times, and highly recomended this book. He said the only place you could find it was on the ferry (?). There are several editions ('80, '89, '94) and I don't know the difference. Make sure the copy you get has waterproof pages (I'm unsure about the early editions!)."
3,Essentially the print cookbook on CD,"""Joy of Cooking"" is one of the best-known cookbooks ever published, and for good reason. Like the print version, this CD offers some terrific recipes and excellent cooking advice. Unfortunately, the similarities ultimately extend too far. There's simply not enough new material here to warrant a hearty recommendation, particularly to those who already own a copy of ""Joy.""A particular source of disappointment is the software's failure to tap the strengths of the form. For example, the box promises ""100 illustrated, step-by-step techniques every cook should know."" But these techniques rely far too heavily on written descriptions, wasting a perfect opportunity for helpful video files.More irritatingly, many of the recipes do not even include pictures of the finished dishes.Overall, this product is fine for those who are looking for a searchable copy of ""Joy of Cooking."" And there a few other features some will find helpful. But don't expect many extras."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!,This software is mislabeled and does not run on a modern computer. The only way you can get it to run is to cripple your computer by turning down virtual memory to a level that will cause other applications like Microsoft Office to crash!I bought this and was told by the store that they don't accept returns on opened software (which is somewhat reasonable since people would just make copies and return the software).Don't get ...like me!
1,Not user friendly,"This software has a very cumbersome user interface - it's hard to navigate, searches are cumbersome, and the window is small and can't be resized. I once stumbled across an entry about homemade mayonnaise, but have been unable to find it since, because it's so difficult to navigate.If you're willing to put up with the cumbersome software, you'll find useful information in here, and probably good recipes too - but I'd choose the book any day."
1,Absolute garbage,The cookbook is fantastic! The CD-ROM (version 2.0) is an unmitigated disaster. It will NOT run on your computer unless you tweak its innards to the point where other programs rebel. I tried for ten minutes and then unistalled it. I will stick with the book but the software is dismal.T J Huber
1,Not worth it,"I'm very disappointed in this one. Sadly to say the figure feels like low quality cheap plastic and not durable. The legs can not support the weight of the toy and there is no way to balance unless with additional item. I don't play with these figures, but I do expect them to free stand on a desk or any other place. I don't recommend you to buy this one."
2,1/200 Strike Freedom Gundam HCM Pro 19,"Its a very small figure, smaller than a cell phone but VERY well painted! lots of parts and details! I would say this item was for the diehard gundam fans ONLY!!! or your gonna feel like you wasted alot of money!"
2,Gator ABS Clarinet Case..,Had this case for approximately 2 months and the right case latch broke off. Then 1 month after that the interior nylon strap that holds the top and bottom case halves together came unglued and now the case just flops open. Not impressed with this product. Still waiting on the Gator warranty dept to get back in touch with me.
5,Great cookbook for kids and husbands. :0),"My kids have asked if they can always be the ones to make meals. They have marked which recipes in here they want to make--most of them. Tonight my son made some amazing pink lemonade using a recipe in this book.Each recipe has a two-page spread and a drawing to illustrate each step.No offense to men on my title there--my husband does fine in the kitchen, but he refuses to use cookbooks. He himself declared that this is the sort of cookbook he needs, with the pictures and all. So it's a cookbook for kids and husbands."
1,Not Safe or Convenient,"This chair is a LOSER. The storage compartment door falls open and has room for nothing more than a small bib. The straps come loose and are very diffucult to adjust and clean. Food gets stuck in the crevices and the chair does not come apart so you can clean it(reminds me of the Prima Papa Highchair which also has too many crevices for food to get stuck in). The tray was tight against my son's stomach at 1 year old and he is a little fella. The hooks to detach the tray from the seat are made of soft plastic so they bend and break...the tray also gets stained easily from spaghetti sauce and fruit...very porous, cheap plastic. It is heavy and cumbersome, has no shoulder strap and I would never take it out of the house. The only good thing about this seat is that the tray is useful if you turn it upside down on the floor and put snacks on it."
2,Clasps are not secure.,"I liked the way the seat folds, and it is easy to travel with, however the tray locking clasps are very weak. While in the seat, and pushing on the tray, my 9 month old actually broke one of the claps that holds the tray in place. I replaced the tray, and then broke one of the clasps myself taking the tray off of the seat. If you are using the seat directly with a table and not using the tray, this booster seat is fine."
3,Convenient for travel,"I really like this booster seat because it folds compactly and is lightweight. We used this with our daughter who is now 5 and kept it in our van mostly for travel and restaurants and then moved it into our kitchen because it was the only booster we could find that would fit under our table. I liked to take our own seat places because restaurant chairs are always so filthy. I don't really like the tray. One of the tabs broke early on. I should have returned it. Also, the tray is very small. We have twin boys now and need another one of these for travel. I think this time I will buy the FisherPrice Healthy Care because the reviews here on line are very good, but I will still use this one as well."
2,Too small for it's own good,"Makes for an attractive concept but does not deliver the goods when called to service. It's just too small to hold a growing baby. The table top sits very low to the seat; getting a baby in and out without taking the tray away is near impossible. And fold-up and straps storage is not very functional; the top pops off the seat too easily and retracting the straps is a cumbersome process. Also, the tray is quite small; you can't rely on the booster alone, additional surface space is necessary for routine feeding. We used the product about four times, until our baby outgrew the booster before his first birthday. I suggest a restaurant-style Cambro booster over this product any day."
3,Ok at first,"This is good for awhile but the straps now no longer ""wind"" up. We returned the first one after 3 months and exchanged it for another one. Now the second one has the same problem. The seat is still better than using a restaurant high chair though!"
5,LOVE THIS!,"Not THE MOST portable product out there, but we bought this after being very disappointed with the On-The-Go Booster Seat (never self-inflated fully, no tray so fabric was impossible to keep clean, slid around on chair no matter how tight we made straps, etc).This product is easy to clean, folds neatly, and stays securely on a chair. Also works welll alone on the floor. Works with or without the tray. We've had no problems with the stability of the fold-out legs. We keep ours in the back seat of the car, so we're never without it at relatives or restaurants!"
4,Love it!!!,"My son loves this seat!! He prefers to eat out of this seat instead of his highchair. I also like the way it all folds down and snaps together, keeping the pieces in one spot. I always take this seat to my mom's (her house is small, and doesn't have room for a high chair). I usually don't use the tray because it is small and unadjustable (no way for bigger babies to use it), but I have and would tell friends about this booster seat."
3,"Works well, but not the best","I bought this to use for a babysitting co-op, and thought it'd be portable. It does the job, but the tray is it's biggest flaw; it is not easy to clip on or remove (could be easier). I also have the 4-stage seat from First Steps, and like it a LOT better. Final opinion: works in a pinch, but shop around before you buy this one."
3,Straps do not retract,I really like this booster seat. We mainly use it when we go to a restaurant. The only complaint I have is that the strap mechanism stopped working after a few months of use. The straps do not retract. We have been using the seat since our son was 6 months old. He is now 17 months. It is annoying to have the straps hanging when the seat is not in use.
2,The Tray Doesn't Stay!,"I think the seat is convenient because it folds up for travel, but it's not very sturdy and I don't like it because my son had no problem popping the tray off, and food went flying everywhere.I gave it a second chance and the same thing happened. Now I just use a hand-me-down Fisher Price solid plastic booster seat. It also has a seat belt, but it's much more sturdy."
1,My daughter broke the tray after three weeks!!! DO NOT BUY!,"After only three weeks, my daughter (13 months) was able to pop the tray off herself. The last time she pulled it off, the clip that holds the tray in broke and stuck in the chair.If I hadn't had my daughter buckled in, she would've fallen to the floor!By the way, the tray isn't large enough to hold a baby-sized plate. (let alone plate, utensils and drink!)DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Nice Chair to Use When Visiting,"My in-laws live far away, and they bought this chair for my daughter to use when we stay at their house. She has been able to comfortably sit in it since about 5 months old. The extendable straps are great, and I've had no problem attaching it to a number of different styles of dining chairs. I think my daughter feels like she is included more with the adult diners when she sits in this chair versus when she sits in her highchair at our home. It really could be used as a permanent highchair. The only reason I am not rating it with 5 stars is because the lid to the storage compartment on the back always swings open when I try move the chair, and has even fallen off a few times. This storage compartment is useless and has always been a nuisance for me."
5,Indispensable! Great product!!,"We bought this seat to avoid the icky and unsafe highchairs at many restaurants. However, we've found the seat to be indispensable for other uses as well. We packed this with us for use as a highchair on a family tour all over New England -- it is lightweight and does fit (carefully) in a large suitcase. We've hosted our son's little friends for meals or snacks. We love this seat! Our only complaint: the mechanism on the retractable straps is loud and draws attention in restaurants."
4,"Wonderful for a booster seat, but tray is a bit too low.","I love almost everything about this chair. The only thing that is not practical, is the way the tray on the chair is so low, it almost rests on top of my childs legs. She's a little string bean as it is. I don't know how well it would work for a bigger child. Plus, then the food has more room to fall. But, if you're buying this just for a seat, to travel with, this is perfect.I love the way it folds.I love the easy clean up.It has a small storage area, for bibs and spoons.The straps are nice and comfy.It has a neat mechanism to wind the straps tight around the chair, with just the turn of a little crank.I recommend this chair to my friends. Good luck!"
1,The tray fits WAY too tight against baby's tummy!,"My son is only 10 months old and can't use this seat because there's not enough space between the seat and the tray. He's not a fat child, either, only in the 50th % and it cuts right into his belly. I'll be returning it today."
4,Great seat for the price...,"I bought this seat for my one year old daughter, after my mother-in-law saw another couple using it at a restaurant. It's is a great seat to take to parties and holiday dinners. The only problem I have with it is folding it back down the tray come off easy if not put in correctly."
4,Space-saver that grows with baby,"I got this for my daughter when she just started on solids...she's 15 months now, and she still uses this feeding seat. It worked just fine then and still completes the job now. This seat is a permanent fixation to our dining chair, and fold up so that the chair can be tucked away under the table like it's not even there! The only con, the base isn't too stable, we've got it on a place mat to keep it in place. Just make sure to check the straps every so often."
2,Not very convenient at all.,"I purchased this seat before an 800 mile trip to Florida with my 5-month-old daughter. I am a bit leery of restaurant highchairs for many reasons. I found that this seat was a bit stiff to fold, and the tray was difficult to lock on in both the upright AND folded position. Not handy if you are all hungry and in a hurry. Also, if only booths are available to sit in, the tray would not be an option, and the height of the seat is would not adjust high enough for her to reach. I returned this seat, and borrowed my friend's table-lock type high chair instead. Bottom line: I could have made it work if I had to, and the price was good for the purpose."
2,This booster is not what we hoped it would be.,I'm the mother of 2 girls (ages 1 and 2)Problems:1. The compartment lid absolutely will not stay closed and never has.2. It is just about impossible to clean completely without taking it apart and that is also just about impossible without breaking it.3. The tray only has one position which was qhite snug on both of my kids and they are average size.Benefits:1. I love the ratcheting belts so you don't have to drag them or tie them up.2. I also love the design of the seat buckles. My 2 year old can fasten herself in but can't get herself out. That's perfect.3. I do like how it all folds up and is compact. We've taken it everywhere because restaurant highchairs are just so nasty.
3,Not as well built as I thought,"I bought this booster seat after reading many reviews of it and other booster options. It does fold easily and become compact for travel. However, the tray slopes away from the child and that ridge is just about large enough to keep a fruit puff on, but provides no retention at all for a sippy cup or rolling cheerio. In addition the tray is held on in the folded position with two small tabs and a clip. The tabs interfere with putting the tray on when the seat is in use. Don't force the tray on, it takes very little pressure to snap off the tabs and then the tray won't stay on in the folded position anymore. Without the tray it is a pretty good booster seat, but don't get this if you will need to use the tray."
2,"Ok Chair, Terrible Tray","The idea of this travel booster seat is good, but it just doesn't work w/ a toddler who can easily remove the tray. There is no locking mechanism to hold the tray in place so my son has no problem at all grabbing it and throwing it to the floor along w/ his dinner.... very disappointed in this product."
2,tray too snug!,"I loved the idea of this booster seat, I think it's great that it can fold up. We bought it today and will be taking it back tomorrow. I put my 8 month old in it and the tray was pushing into his tummy-not very comfy! He weighs 20 pounds and I guess most of it is his waistline. I am very disappointed in this product. I hope the company improves it by making the tray somehow adjustable."
2,Did Not Work for ME,"I did not like this product. I chose this instead of a regular high chair because it was cheaper, and I liked the idea. It did fit well to the chair though. I was able to tighten it so it did not move at all. It was just very uncomfortable for my 10month old. She kept ending up sliding down, I was constantly having to straigten her. Thank goodness, I kept the box. I took it back and spend [$$] more and bought the highchair I originally wanted. If you like the idea of the booster chair, spent the extra money to get the nicer one."
1,Safety NOT 1st,"I needed a compact booster seat for traveling. I purchased this one and was very disappointed with it. First of all, I feel the straps are very unsafe. The 2 straps which should come from the back of the seat, actually come from the bottom so it secures the child very low which allows them to lean over the sides. The tray is difficult to put on, in both positions. And my daughter is an average sized 7 month old and will not be able to fit in the seat with the tray on for much longer. The only redeeming quality is that the straps retract into the seat so that they are not hanging out while being transported. (Not quite a trade-off for my child's safety.) Needless to say, I will be returning this product."
1,Not good for babies,I bought this because it looked more compact for going out and was cheeper. I have a six month old and it is no good for her. It gives no support what so ever. I then bought the 4 stage reclining seat and it is great! Spend the extra money first!
2,Straps come loose,"I'm not in love with this chair. When traveling, the tray won't stay attached to the bottom, like it is supposed to (a minor, but irritating problem when you're trying to tote a lot of gear.) More importantly, I can't get the straps to stay taut around the chair; they're always loose after my daugter eats a meal in the chair, which allows her to rock back and forth in it and bang her head against the chair back. Finally, it's a pain to clean up with all its nooks and crevices. I wouldn't recommend this chair."
2,Safety my a$$,"I purchased this chair at Christmas time for my daughter. I wish I would have considered other similar ones out there. THREE months later my daughter can pull the tray. With the tray off could lead to injuries, ect.. the functionality is good but as far as safety its very very poor! Its hard to believe that a company with safety in its name would promote a poor seat."
4,Great for travel and on the go,"I have not found another seat that packs up as easily as this one. It is so easy to take on the go and set up quickly. We keep ours in the car trunk for that reason.I did buy another one for home use. This one has a lower back support and our son is tall. Also, like others said, the tray is not adjustable and doesn't leave much room for his big belly."
1,Very Disappointed!,"We purchased this chair for our 14-month old son with the intent of using it mainly for travelling and eating out. The handle for the chair is very small making it difficult to carry it along with a toddler. The seat is cumbersome to unfold and the tray...bad design! The tray goes on pretty easily but you need a structural engineer to remove it! The straps that attach the seat to the chair are retractable but only when you turn a crank on the underside of the chair that makes a very, very loud noise (less than ideal when you are out at a restaurant!). We had high hopes that this chair would work for us and were very disappointed when we tried using it. We have since bought The First Years On-The- Go booster that self-inflates and LOVE IT!!!"
3,mom of twins,"we bought these portable high chairs for feedings away from home. the only complaint is the tray doesn't slide on to fit the child's mid-section. it snaps in place, so if your baby's belly resembles a normal pudgy tummy, it'll be a VERY snug fit and possibly too tight."
1,Tray broke 2nd time used!,"I bought this booster seat without checking the reviews like I normally do, and what a dissaster! The tray broke (locking clip on left side broke off) and now my 1 year old can easily pop off the tray with one kick of his leg. The tray itself is not adjustable so as he gets bigger he will outgrow it. The booster is not as compact as I thought, so I don't really know how much better of a traveling seat it is than others. So next time....I will check the reviews first! Lesson learned."
5,A hit with 2 toddlers!!!,I purchased this booster seat after having baby #2 in as many years. I couldn't get away with one with 2 toddlers and this one is a way better product than our 1st booster. Great product easy to use and very easy to travel with. No separate pieces to hang onto and lose. This all snaps into one piece so that even with tray it is 1 item to carry and lightweight. Other products are not as versatile as this one. As a older infant/young toddler you can use the tray when feeding. Once your child reaches the age where they want to join the family at the table you remove the tray and childs chair can be pushed right up to your dining table. Easy to clean as well (I have even put it through the dishwasher!!!)
4,Pappy loves it!,"Purchased this for when the grandkids come. Very user friendly. Kids love the colors, I love the ease of operation. Stays in the chair all week, just waiting for the little ones to come over. Wouldn't purchase to use as a traveler or on dinner outings. May be found to be difficult to put in a chair away from home. Great chair for money spending grandparents! Makes a great gift for other grandparents, too."
3,Fisher Price easier to use,"We have taken our one-year-old to restaurants with us for months, and I purchased this booster seat and the Fisher-Price booster seat (one for my car, one for Daddy's). This one is OK, but not great. I have found it much more difficult to set up when we get to the restaurant, and my daughter doesn't seem as comfortable in it. It IS functional, but not comfortably so. Because I've found the Fisher-Price booster so much easier to use, I gave this one just three stars."
3,read your reviews!,"I just bought this booster today and should have read these online reviews before heading to the store. I have a 10 month old girl, average size ( 18 1/2 lbs ) and the tray already squishes her tummy, unfortunalty it does not have tray adjustments to accomodate a growing child. I can't imagine that she will fit in it in a few months. Also, when you take the tray off, you have to push it toward the child with a bit of force, and in my case, squishing my baby's tummy more! After reading the reviews, I am upgrading (for 5$ more dollars!) to the Fisher Price Healthy booster seat. Its worth the extra few dollars after reading the online rave reviews!"
2,Pass on this one...........too much cleaning!!!,"We have 3 boys, two still in boosters. I bought this booster second for my 1 yr old (I was saving $5). We have a pretty active lifestyle and travel often...booster seats are the BEST for this. Problem is this one is the pits!It doesn't fit many chairs (square back)Cleaning is a nightmare! - The straps are underneath where the child sits and all the food gets dropped. I constantly trying to dig the gunk out of where the straps go through the bottom.Nothing like smooshed banana...yeeeuck.The storage tray never stays closed when carrying it around.If I were to do it again I would get another Fisher Price -Healthy Care Booster (the first one I bought). I don't need to hassle of cleaning this one!"
2,Fold N Go Booster,"I just purchased this product and was so excited that this booster was so compact and would be easy to transport. However, when I set the product up, I wasn't very impressed. The whole design just looked too small...especially the tray. My son, who is only 11 months old, looked so uncomfortable when I put him into the booster to try it out. The tray isn't adjustable and it was firmly pressed into his tummy. Needless to say, I just purchased this product today and will be returning it tomorrow. The booster states that it is useful up to 4 years of age. My son hasn't even turned 1 and he already doesn't fit into this product. So unless your infant/toddler is very tiny, I wouldn't recommend this booster at all."
4,Great chair!,"What a great chair. I can see that you could do without a large higchair and get away with just this - and it is really portable.It folds up well and is quick to set up. I like that it attaches in two places to your chair. There is a handy compartment in the seat back that you can put spare bibs etc. It doesn't recline, so a baby that is not sitting by herself would not be well supported. If you are buying a booster instead of a highchair, I would go with one of the more expensive reclining models.I gave it only four stars because it does not seem like it will last long. My daughter is 9 months and average weight and the tray fits a little snug. But she loves to sit at the 'big table' with the rest of the family. All in all, a great purchase for the price."
4,Really used this product,"We bought this booster for our daughter when she first learned to sit up, and we are still using it 2 years later.Pros:-straps retract, so they aren't dangling when you take it somewhere.-everything on it wipes clean easily.-folds compactly for portability.-has attachable tray.-compartment in back for storing a bib.-durable (ours only has a couple of superficial scratchs after 2 years of abuse).-very affordable.Cons:-the tray doesn't adjust, so its unusable now that our daughter's tummy sticks out more.-the tray removal takes getting used to (although we've never had problems with it breaking like some of the other reviewers).Overall, this is a great seat. Compact, portable and durable. It's small size means that you don't have to take up your whole kitchen with a highchair. We use this chair everyday, and we've taken it camping, out to eat, and to Grandma's. I highly recommend a booster seat, and with this price you can't really go wrong."
5,Can't Live Without It,"This is one of the best baby pieces we own. You can take it ANYWHERE and it attaches to the seat, with or without the tray. It's a breeze to clean, fold, and store. As early as four-months-old my daughter was comfortable in this seat. This is a must have for every mom."
1,Design needs to improve,"Purchased this for my 23 month old daughter and do not like it because the tray is not adjustable so the food falls on my daughter's lap and inside the seat (tray doesn't sit close enough), the tray surface is way too small so stuff is easily knocked off, and the door to the storage compartment on seat back will not stay latched and keeps coming open. I do like the retractable straps, but that's about it."
2,Forget the tray. Good compact booster,"I needed a portable chair that I could leave in the car when I want to use it at Grandma's or at a resturant. It suited my main need. It is compact and folds into a small profile. But the tray is a complete waste of time. My 16 month son easily ripped it off. I like the retractable straps and height extensions. Be warned, you need to pull the strap all the way out and tighten by pulling the straps from the buckle."
1,Tray can be removed by child. MESS!,"At first glance, this appears to be the ideal booster seat. It does fold up easily and the interior of the chair is easy to clean after each meal. HOWEVER, be forewarned. If you don't mind cleaning up food that has been sent flying through the air by your clever little one, then this is the chair for you. Our daughter figured out how to send the tray and it's contents sailing through the air when she decided she was finished eating. I would recommend the older safety first model which had a better locking mechanism. But they are rare and hard to find. Don't try customer service, they will not take the chair back, and refused to believe that there was a problem. As you can see from several other reviewers, there is a problem with this product. Good luck!"
1,Not safe and difficult to use!,"I found the tray on this booster very difficult to get off. You have to push it in first and then up, and I nearly hit the baby in the face when pushing it in because it can't be done easily. After only a couple uses, one of the latches that secures the tray to the chair broke off. I returned it immediately and bought the Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster, which I absolutely love."
2,Good idea that needs some work.,"A portable, collapsible chair would be a great thing to have if only it worked. Our four-month-old cannot sit in the chair while the tray is in place. It's just too tight a squeeze the way it's been designed."
1,Did Not Work for Me,"I did not like this chair. I opted for this booster chair because of it's price and I liked the idea. Boy did I get what I paid for. Nothing but pieces of plastic. Although, it did attach securey to the chair. No worries about her falling out. But my 9 month old daughter kept slumping down, I was continuously having to straighten her. It looked very uncomfortable. I finally gave up and took it back. I bought the high chair I originally wanted. If you like the idea for the booster chair, pay the extra money to get something of better quality."
5,Great For Away-From-Home Feedings,"My mother-in-law bought this booster seat when we came to visit with our 9 month old and it worked great. I especially liked that it had a tray. Plus, it was easy to fold up and carry. We took it back home with us and have used it when we have been over at friends' houses for dinner. There is no way it would replace the high chair at home, but it is great and priced right for when you need to feed away from home."
2,"Good chair, the tray stinks though!","Overall we really like this chair and it comes in handy. One thing I hate is the way the tray comes on and off. It's really easy to get the tray on but the way you have to remove it is impossible if the kid is in the seat. In trying to get it off without crushing my daughters chest I broke off one of the tabs. Now it doesn't fold for travel as well as it should. We still leave it in the trunk and use it when we go out, but if I had to buy another one I probably wouldn't buy this one again or recommend it to others."
1,Hard to use,"I found that it was difficult for my five month old to sit up in this chair without falling over. The storage unit was very small, too small for anything but a bib. My mom used it one day and broke the hook that holds the tray on."
3,clips broke on tray,"I really like the booster seat until the clips broke on the tray when the child pulled up on the tray. I was wondering how much it would cost to get a new one. Myaddress is Marilyn Burrell, 295 sixth av. box 1481, Lively Ontario, P3Y 1N2AThank You, Marilyn"
2,MIL bought this for her house.,"It seems flimsy to me...I loved the old wooden highchair she had from dh and his brother, but she said it must not be comfortable, because they didn't want to stay in it - it now lives at MY folks and ds loves it.Anyway, this plastic seat can't be easily moved from one room to another - it straps onto a regular dining chair. Ds can't climb up onto it, as there is no footrest like his wooden chairs have. It also doesn't fit under her dining table very well. It ends up being too short for ds to have a good view of the table. MIL loves it because it's new, but I don't."
2,Flimsy and frustrating.,"I thought I'd love it because it folds up small and has all these neat little features. But the one thing that just didn't sit right with me was its flimsiness!The tray is at best a thin piece of plastic. It's also hard to put on and take off the seat. Furthermore, you can't adjust its position on the booster.The lid for the so-called compartment in the back hardly stays in place, and pops off with the slightest jiggle, making it impossible to store anything in it.The wind-up straps don't really lock in place -- the straps can easily slip loose while fastened on the chair, making it very dangerous for the child.The only remarkable feature that it has is that it folds up smaller than any of the other booster seats with trays that I've seen on the market. But because it's so flimsy and frustrating to use, we returned it as soon as I took it out of the box."
3,for small babies only!!,This chair is good only if your baby is small. One of my guys is a little chubby and we can't put the tray on beacause it squeezes his tummy.I do like the fact that it fold up very nicely for travel purposes.
1,Not worth it,"Don't bother with this one....Hard to cleanTray is tight, small and falls offBack compartment is too small for anything but a tiny bib and the door falls open constantly anyway.It slides and has no grippers or suction to grab a chair.It is clumsy to travel with."
2,Taking this chair back..............,I am taking this chair back because the tray is awful. The tray falls off and is not at all secure. The Fisher Price one is much better!
2,"good idea, not durable",I never even got my child into this seat - the chair back would not lock into place. The plastic notches that are supposed to hold this area securely are very cheap and seem like they would wear with use. I am returning this and trying a different product.
3,Great for smaller babies!,"This booster worked great until my little guy was 11 months because the tray is not adjustable, it was too tight on our son's tummy. We will save it for when we need just the booster without the tray but until then we are purchasing a different booster to travel with us."
2,His Monkey Wife,"Quirky books always get my attention, and this one had lots of promise. However, the victorian language was so stilted and verbose it was hard to appreciate the story. I kept plowing through it, hoping to get to the quirky, fun part of the story, and it never came! The story begins with a charming premise: The pet chimp is jealous of the simpering fiancee. The chimp's machinations to foil the fiancee are amusing at first. Then, it is as if the author got tired of being clever and merely wrote to get the story finished. The story goes beyond quirky and into the truly bizarre. I was disappointed."
1,Terrible,Lousy product. Purchased with the intention of using as a salt grinder. There is no control over the size of the salt and it leaves a mess every where. Very disappointed in this one. It gets returned and I'll be getting Olde Thompson instead.
1,Not very happy,"I purchased this because of its high ratings but have been terribly disappointed. If you like to chew your pepper for a while then this may suit you, but pepper the size of peas is not something I want on my food. I'll stick to William Bounds in future."
1,Messy and hard to fill,"Extremely difficult to fill, especially sea salt. You have to push the bottom shut with a knife to keep the salt or peppercorns from running out. Leaks, have to keep a small plate under to catch salt leaking out."
1,Squeak squeak,"The complaints about the pepper grinder squeaking and spitting out huge chunks of peppercorns are 100% true. Try to avoid this one if you can. I would try to get a refund, but it's just not worth the hassle. What a waste."
5,EXCELLENT VALUE,"This mill performs as promised and is beautiful to boot. I would expect to pay much more for such a product. The grind is even and consistent. The appearance is sleek and modern, yet classic. I would highly recommend this mill and will consider buying another in the future as a gift."
3,Not quite beginners level,I like this DVD but didn't find it as helpful as others I have purchased. Although it is beautifully done I thought it lacked adequate instruction to be super helpful to a beginner. Perhaps after I become a little more proficient I will find this DVD to be just right.
4,pleasantly surprised,"This is a pretty good dvd. Best for advanced beginners, I'd say. That's when I used it. There were some new moves in with some old favorites."
3,Not realistic for true beginners,"I had no experience with bellydance before I purchased this DVD. However, while it is a neat concept (the dance is broken down, the pieces practiced, and then put together,) this product is not realistic for a true beginner.1) The light skinned instructor wears white clothing against a white background. Her moves, while slow to be instructional, did not stand out enough for me to copy them effectively.2) The instructor wears long, baggy pants, so it isn't possible to see how her leg is positioned. I can see the tips of her toes, but I can't even tell if she is wearing heels or if she is just flexing her foot.3) The dances are pretty boring. Not that I expected to do much the first time, but I actually got this video for exercise and muscle toning and the dances are so boring and minimal that my heart rate doesn't even go up."
1,Poor Review,"I purchased ths product 3 weeks ago and still have not been able to get it functioning. Apparently HP knows about the many issues of compatibility. I called HP help desk, they were no help. I paid someone to come here and make it work, still doesn't work. I give up, I plan to return it."
5,Get ready for amazing comedy that will zing you!,"Brilliant, thought provoking and smart, Surviving Dirk takes us on a trip then turns it into a vicious game of chicken that never wants to release no matter how much the late fees or the size of the pimp.Back off! If you're not ready for edge of your seat comedy. If you are ready, then hang on a minute, we're still getting dressed (drunk and imbalanced so please back off again).What's that? They're starting ""Surviving Dirk"" again at the local cinema? Cool, thanks for letting us know. I'm going to cement myself into the theater, be it by flesh or fireworks. Super cool guys! Thanks! This movie rocks!"
4,Interesting read,I read and critiqued this book for LS 424 Children and Young Adult Lit class in the spring of 2004. The author grabs the reader's attention from the first page. I found that the appealing factors of this book are that its multi-narrarated and the way the author fills this book with real psychological teenage issues and drama. The book has a gloomy ending leaving the reader possibly grieving at the loss. But sometimes life presents situations where things don't work the way you want them to and you must still go on. Hopefully learning from the tragedy.
5,"good mag, nice deal",The first issue just arrived. Now I don't have to read it in the bookstore or library. Its a good magazine.
4,Useful magazine for Mac users.,"This magazine provides useful information for Mac users. Sure you can get lots of information on the web but first you have to know you want it and then decide whether to trust the information you get. MacLife is good adjunct to the Internet.FYI... I do not consider myself a ""power"" user but I do use my iLife and iWork applications every day."
4,Helpful,"I've been a Mac user for 20 years and never subscribed to a computer magazine. In two issues, I've already learned a couple of new tricks. Well worth the price."
5,Economical updates,MAC WORLD HAS BECOME TOO COSTLY. MAC ADDICT IS ECONOMICAL AND PROVIDES ALL THE CURRENT INFO I REQUIRE. GOOD REVIEWS AND PLEASANT FORMAT
5,Best Magazine Ever!,"I absolutely love MacLife! This magazine is packed with practical tips, how-to's, reviews on products and apps, and features that you would never even know about for all the Apple products you know and love."
4,Good content,"This magazine has good content, but they also have an app that provides the same content for free. I got my subscription for a very good price through amazon on a lightning deal, so I don't mind."
2,"Mostly eye-candy, little useful content","Magazine is mostly fluff. Meaningless, lavishly illustrated but silly lead stories (""products we'd like to see"") take up a large amount of space. Product reviews are very limited and superficial. A review of banking software, for example, really only discussed ease of set-up without even mentioning critical features like transaction downloading and investment management. Magazine is for the novice, and even then 2 issues is more than enough."
2,I'm Disappointed!,"I've gotten the first two issues and it seems stilted and almost totally Leopard and MacAir focused. If you've got even a Macbook, don't count on much in the way of new tips. And if you've got something older, system or something they aren't selling...... forget it! Felt to me like it's owned and operated by Apple... even though they ""say"" it's written by Mac enthusiasts. (I guess Mac employes would qualify for that).On the other side, good articles on Leopard and MacAir. Step by step instructions on use of them and other brand new products and things ""for sale"" at Apple.I miss the ""old days"" where Mac magazines told you how to upgrade old macs and tips for everything Mac, not just the new stuff."
3,beautiful glossy pages of advertising,"Stuffed full of adds, this mag occasionally has some helpful articles and reviews, but I doubt there are any that couldn't be found for free on the net."
4,More entertaining than Macworld...,"me thinks anyway... i always saw macworld as Apple's public relations magazine... it's informative, but they seem to do whatever Apple wants in so far as the information that they present... not necessarily skewed reviews, but they're not trying to ... Steve Jobs off either... MacAddict is a little more fun of a format... it's also very informative.... i try to never bother with the CD/DVD rom of shareware.... i'll find it over the net if its that important to me."
5,one of my favorite mac mags,I get this as well as Mac Home and Mac World. I like Mac Addict the most. It has a wealth of information that is good for the common user. It has a good advertising section in the back of the magazine that is great to flip through. I really enjoy the CDs that come with the magazine - it comes with materials that are written about in the issue. Mac Addict also writes with a sense of humor - always a good thing!
3,Its ok. I wont renew but it is ok,"The magazine is OK, but has tons of advertisements(more than my other subscriptions. There are some helpful articles but nothing I can get on apples website. The how too's on apples website are actually better. Anyhow there's my 2 cents."
2,Fluff and suggestions to waste money,"Disappointed in this magazine. The content is primarily derived from product announcements and press releases. Maybe OK for the excessively affluent looking for new gadgets and software to waste money on, but don't expect to find much in the way of useful tips for actually using your mac."
2,Digital Illustrator,Wayyyyyyyyyyyy to many AD's..Not enough about Mac's!!Or tips & techniques..I am very disappointed...sorry...
2,Not the great read it once was...,"Having been a charter subscriber since Issue One, paying full subscriber rates, I am now subscribing disc-less at cut rate. Can't put my finger on it, but MacAddict has lost something. Too juvenile, too silly, too much waste of my time... I'm not sure. But I'm not ready to cut the cord just yet. Sorry, Rick. In the meantime, I'm putting my hard earned cash on MacHome, a much improved magazine with great promise."
2,what happened?,"i got a subsription after not reading the mag for several years. its turned from fun and creative to mediocre and lifeless. It feels like this is being published out of someones basement. The articles are all a month behind Macworld and usually are based around the mags highest selling point, the demo cd. Then just for fun, theres articles on how to make your mouse blink or how to turn your mac on with the garage door opener.The last 3 issues have been exactly the same, covering iLife and only get slightly more desriptive from the previous issue.I used to love this magazine. Now its kinda just fallen into a steady groove."
1,For techie gamers,"It's no MacUser (RIP). The current version of this magazine is too technical/geeky for the average Mac user--far from the content when I last subscribed years ago (I made the mistake of subscribing without seeing a recent issue). The issues are now thin and heavy with advertising. The writing, though refreshingly evangelistic at times, seems to be geared toward young gamers and the like. -- a Mac user since 1990."
1,Worthless Mac promotion,"I've been using mac PC's since the 80's and found they generally are worth the limited software and 60% extra cost as a Windows computers. That being said, the last thing I want is a magazine that ignores problems with the Mac. If you can't admit there's a problem, you can't print the solution. Instead, the magazine is nothing more than a forum for advertisers."
4,Mac Computer Info,"Having been a Apple user since AppleII, I find MacLife very informative with reviews, produce info, evaluation about Macs. Amazon had a good price for a 2 yr new or renew magazine."
3,only half of the magazine,"What? What happens to the discs? Fifteen bucks without the disc, thirty bucks with the disc, you are offering only half of a magazine."
3,Not real impressed,I got my first issue this week and was skimming through it last night. I was not real impressed. It seems rather full of itself which I guess is what it's title implies. I had gotten a new I-pod for Christmas and was hoping to get some helpful ideas on how to utilize it. I have not found anything yet. I get more from Kim Komando than from this. Fortunately the price was good so I'm not upset. If I had paid full price I would have felt ripped off.
5,The Mac Mag,This magzine is great. It's articals arn't boring like Mac World's and The Disc always has plenty of useful and fun software.
5,MacLife magazine subscription,Great price for renewal of a magazine I have enjoyed over many years. Lots of useable information monthly about Apple products.
4,"A good magazine, would like a little more content and less ads","MacLife is a good magazine. Every month it covers a lot of the hottest topics and has a decent balance between content and ads, but as a paying subscriber I would really like to see a lot more content and a lot less ads. If you want to get a feel for what the magazine is like you can visit their website at www.maclife.com and see the quality of the articles they write."
1,"Vulgar language, high school writing, should be iPhone Life","I was looking for objective reviews of Mac products, specially computer software and hardware because it is limited to a few pages of most technology magazines. The writers are not objective, half of each issue is devoted to the iPhone, and the writing is only slightly better than that of my high school students. The use of profanity as well as poor analysis reveals this to be a very unprofessional magazine. I'll not be renewing my subscription."
2,Bad articles,Just not the kind of reporting I expected. Search online and you will get better information for less.
1,Never got a single issue of my subscription,"I did not use Amazon to subscribe to MacLife, as far as I can remember there was an offer on Version Tracker in February 2007. Nevertheless, I have not seen a single issue of the publication. I contacted their customer service a couple of times and finally asked for a refund but did not receive it either.Subscribe at your own peril."
2,"Save Time, SAve Money, Save Your Sanity, SKIP THIS!!!!","I love my Mac. I have had a Mac since college, since the first ""Wild Eeep"" was available. But unless you are a real EggHead, I find that this and the ""other"" Mac Mag is just too much Mac Mush. Honestly, what I do is go to Amazon.com's electronics section (...) and peruse the information there about products. I don't have to fight my way through a bunch of cyber-jargon or EggHead lingo. And I don't have to fight for three months to get the renewal taken off my credit card."
1,No item to review!,"I would like to write a review, but I have yet to receive the item ..... MacLife ... that was ordered August 5th 2007. When and/or if I receive it, I will be happy to make my review."
1,Cringeworthy,"Where Macworld is bad, Addict is dreadful. It is dumbed down to the level of Teen Beat, and the ""reviews"" don't deserve the name. The extent to which it drools over Apple is embarassing, leaving no pretence of independence. Like its competitor, it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry, so we get articles about the ""secrets"" of such and such product. A ""secret"" in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer. This should be blasted, not applauded. But Addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product."
4,No Mac owner should be without MacAddict,"My fist copy of MacAddict was issue 6 and I haven't missed one since. The subscription cost is worth it just for the Disc. Back in the days when 28.8 was a screaming fast modem, the Disc was a lifesaver packed with a weeks worth of downloads. That was also back when Apple let MacAddict put OS updates on the Disc but Steve put an end to that :( The How To sections vary from ""Yeah Whatever"" to ""...Awesome"" and some go where the vast majority of Mac owners should never venture (overclocking an iBook!!). Others, like some of the Photoshop tips, make the one year cost [worth it] compared to what you pay for a book. The content is thin sometimes and the reviews tend to cheerlead a bit but MacAddict is still head and shoulders over any other Mac magazine. If you own a Mac, you should subscribe for at least a year. After that, you should have a good collection of Disc's with the essentials (Stuffit, BBEdit, GraphicConverter, etc) and you can decide if you want more."
3,Better Sources of Fast Information on Apple & Mac Now Exist,"MACLIFE does not keep up with the fast pace of the online world. First, when I have a problem with my Mac or with my ipod or iphone, I don't use MACLIFE as a resource. Instead, I go to the Google search engine and slug in the words for my problem. Within seconds, not only do I have the best answers from all over the online world but I also have the solution within the top five hits. Second, I have an entire page on my iGoogle site which has gadgets for all the major Apple and Mac sites online. They all have instant info on any big news going on for a Mac or Apple products user. MACLIFE, in short, needs a lot of work in order to keep up with the pace of today's online audio and visual world."
5,A New Fan of Big Band,"I agree with the previous review 100%. The BBC Big Band Orchestra provides a modern day experience of what it must have sounded like in the '40s. I have a new appreciation for the arrangement talents of the old band leaders and the technical proficiency of the musicians. With modern-day recording techniques and modern listening equipment, it's like the band is in the room with you. The BBC musicians and singers are outstanding and a joy to listen to."
1,Defective,"Cheap stapler: the metal piece that pushes the staple into the paper, was bent out of place, which was making it defective. I tried to bend it into its proper place but it just broke. Waste of money."
3,Great design; unfortunate execution,"I have looked extensively for a small stapler to carry in my bag. It seems like I've had one of every kind. The design of this stapler is really ingenious. I've never seem anything like it and it could have been a great find if it had been made better. It's plastic (of course!) and I have little faith that it will hold up over time. In order to staple, you need to slide a button which moves a mechanism inside. It's really hard to slide and I always forget which way to slide it, so I never know if it's stuck or I'm pushing the wrong way. If this was made of metal and executed well, I'd pay $40 for it. I hate that the mentality now is buy one and when it breaks, just buy another. Grrr."
1,a piece of trash I got,"It looks very fancy, but can not do its job at all. Feel like spending money on a trash. Very disappointed."
2,Didn't work,"This stapler didn't work at all, I assume it was a defected item. I would have happily tried a new one, but I wasn't given the option to get a refund or even file a claim."
1,Cheap Product,It is the worst product I ever bought from Amazon. Till now I have bought so many products but this one is so cheap quality. Definitely not worth the price. I definitely don't recommend to anyone. The button to open and close is so stiff that even after putting some lubricant I was not able to move it front and back. You can get better product from ebay.
1,Cheep construction,Used it couple of times to staple not more than 2 papers then it fell apart. See picture titeled went apart.
2,"Quality brand name, inferior product","Don't let the fact that this is a Swingline fool you. While the design has potential, this stapler is not-user friendly. The button that you must slide to get it in position moves VERY hard. Maybe a strong hand could do it, but should a mini-stapler really require athletic muscular strength? I do love the carabiner clip so it doesn't get lost in my briefcase. But it would have been a better use of my money to go buy 5 or 6 dollar-store staplers and then just throw them away."
5,Great Superman DVD,Anything Superman movie or TV show is Aok with me and will wait for the 4th season. This is a must see DVD.
1,Poor Service,Ordered Lois & Clark DVD on 12/11/2011 for a Christmas gift. I'm writing this today on 12/26/2011 and the DVD still has not arrived. Shows in the tracking that it was not even shipped until 12/20/2011. Steer clear of this vendor if you want your product in a timely manner.
3,superman,this dvd was okay but in my opinion season 1 was better in tis season lois was more of a valley girl type she really had no brains
3,Only true Lois and Clark fans will love.,"Season one was the greatest and all that followed slowly lost the spark. This season has the series almost dead. There are a few good episodes, Dean Cain is cute and Teri Hatcher is hilarious but I recommend anyone new to this series to buy the season sets in order, watch them, then decide if you want to purchase season 3."
5,Lois & Clark - The New Adventures of Superman - the Complete Third Season,"I love it. I've seen it almost 10 times. fantastic, romantic, awesome, lovely, sweet. i'll see it over and over again"
3,Typical after a couple of really good seasons,"Started out OK, but was a little lost towards the end. After watching the second disk I almost quit because I got disgusted with the stories. The writers needed to go back and watch the first 2 seasons to relearn the personalities of their characters. the show was still better than most of today's shows."
5,A great escape,"I bought all three seasons and really enjoy them. This is a show you aren't afraid to show anyone. It's just plain fun. Ok, we all hated the wedding arc, but I must agree with a previous comment that the series needed a shakeup. The on screen chemistry between Hatcher and Cain are great. The only problem I have is that the 4th season is not available to finish a series the third season leaves hanging (new krypton arc). This is a great escape in romance."
4,Lots of ups & downs,"The 3rd season wasn't as good as the 2nd in my opinion. Certain episodes were great, but what made it not as good was the whole cloned Lois/amnesia/Lex Luthor/destroyed wedding episodes. I thought they were never going to end. And just when I thought they finally did, there was another twist in the plot. But all of the other episodes were quite good (there were only about 5 bad ones that I will probably rarely watch again!). I love this series, though because it is funny and sweet. I hope that I don't have to wait too long for the 4th season - does anyone know when it comes out?"
5,"Nice price, and brand new!",This season was hard to find brand new but I found it on amazon for the same price as used elsewhere! Thanks Amazon.
5,excellent chapter book,"Betsy Duffey consistently delivers terrific children's books. The writing is varied and readable, and there are humor, pathos and realistic problems for early elementary readers. This installment in the series about Cody Michaels is no exception. The plot concerns Cody's trepidations at starting in a new school. He quickly decides that being plain ol' Cody isn't enough to impress his new classmates, so he develops a more interesting persona -- Super Cody! -- who hails from Alaska, is a championship roller skater, and has a pet emu and a dad who is really a secret agent! As you might guess, the truth eventually comes out in a disastrous (but funny) way, and Cody ultimately reveals himself as himself to some new friends. Great story, well told, and an excellent read-aloud book or chapter book for older elementary age children."
3,Tamara Marsh's Review,"""Hey New Kid ""is a very interesting story. it is about a boy named Cody, and he feels depressed until he comesup with the idea of coming up with a whole new identidy for himself. Cody thinks that his new idenitdy willmake him cool and make/ perswade other people be his friend. And at the end he diden't exactly get whathe wanted but he got something.I didn't really like this story that much because, I did not like the point that Cody (the main character) had tocome up with a whole new identidy to get other people to like him. And even though he was a fasinating fakethat didn't change my mind.And to tell the truth, I personally thought that this book could use a little more work."
5,PDA Skins Horizontal PDA Origanizer,"The organzier was exactly what I was looking for. It had plenty of room for my PDA, cell phone, and wallet. A good price for a good product."
2,"Excellent visuals, but missing useful information","Pros: this guidebook has lots of pictures and gives lots of information region by region, detailed cut-outs of major historical buildings. I also found the pictures in the survival guide section useful, where they describe the various Swiss dishes and food/drink products.Cons: no information on how to get to different places by train (e.g. from Interlaken to Schilthorn or Jungfraujoch). I understand the guide cannot list train numbers and times, but at least it could have described how to, for example, get from Luzern to Mt. Titlis by train. Train travel is a big part of the Switzerland experience so this seems like a big omission. There's also not much information on hiking, even though this is a very popular country with hikers. An overview map of hiking trails would have been useful. However, there are other guides that cover hiking so this is a minor omission by comparison."
4,Virtual Switzerland in Print,"I had purchased a similar book for my son about France to help him with his French language courses in high school. I ended up spending more time with it than he did, and when I saw the other country titles, I decided to purchase a few more. The Switzerland book is excellent in that it condenses a lot of information into a very portable volume. The photos and illustrations are fabulous and the background historical and cultural information is superb. The listing of accomodations and restaurants also appears to be very well researched and provides a starting point for further Internet research. My favorite part of Switzerland is the Bernese Oberland, and this book provides a genuine sense of what it is really like. I can definitely benefit from this book on future travel to Switzerland. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to know more about the country, as well as for experienced travellers. Well done to the authors, editors, and publisher!"
1,A good singer trashed,"This CD is the worst quality product possible. Often a song's ending is sudden stopped before the music ends. At times, a song is suddenly terminated by a extremly brief audience response. Furthermore, several songs sound like they were done by a Faron Young imitator.The CD appears to have been done in someone's home and the music does not represent Faron Young performances. My old scratch 45s sound better.Selling product of this quality could give Amazon a bad name."
4,"A Marjorie Holmes Treasury Lord, Let Me Love",Inspring Book! Great read of a collection of works! Excellent shiping time and good communication from seller
1,Poor customer support,Without purchasing an additional licence this unit only supports 8 computers. When I purchased the upgrade (which cost almost as much as the unit) it did not install correctly. Support was unable to resolve the problem and level 2 support never calls back although they reply to my emails by promising to do so. More trouble than it is worth. Other routers don't have this 8 node limit. I'll not buy netgear again.
1,"What a joke, didn't even work right","As a devoted user of Netgear cards and switches I am utterly disappointed in this product. My work purchased this item to use as our router for our new DSL line not knowing that there is a hidden trap and broken features. Only 8 computers can access the internet through this router until you pay even more for additional licenses. Additionally, the redirection of incoming traffic based on port numbers just refuses to work. (...)"
1,FR314 Updating,"The product installs and operated generally on the first try. However, rentry to modify the FR314 is very troublesome. The password entry screen has been defective on 4 out of 4 units I have purchased. A check with other owners of the unit shows the problem is probably related to a critical software design bug in the units firmware. Many people set the unit up once and never need to modify the firmware settings. If the firmware settings need to be modified then the problems are uncovered.There are better DHCP servers/firewalls at comparable prices. While this unit is inexpensive, the problems far outweigh cost considerations. This product received one star because I could not assign it a thumbs down."
4,Excellent for family,"Found it an easy setup straight out of the box using a web browser to input my cable modem's ip address etc. Useful web content filtering which has some configurable elements for blocking a word within a URL. Also has site logging. Unit seems relatively quiet for its class. Great for protecting a family with young/teen kids from less desirable web material - but note that ongoing updates of 'bad' web sites requires an optional subscription. Has been running constantly for several weeks, no problems encountered."
2,Gotchas,Be careful this router does not support PPTP connections with Microsoft Windows NT and 2000. Fact sheets on Netgears web site suggest that it does.
3,OK but 8 node limit is a pain,"Fine as a firewall- seems to run without any intervention. But the 8 node limit is a complete pain and the 20 node upgrade is $$$. It is cheaper to get a seperate router, plug your network into that then use the FR314 as a firewall only and use the other router for NAT so the 314 sees only one IP address from your network."
5,Wow - great book!,"This is a great book written by a new author of true talent. The action's well paced and the suspense created by the mystery just tense enough. I really liked the level of magic in this alternate reality, especially since it didn't take center stage over the plot or characters.Good job and I'm looking forward to reading the rest in the series."
1,Buyer Beware,"This book isn't worth the paper its written on. Nothing but advertisements, get rich schemes. If your interested in a good drop shipper contact me and I'll put in touch with a good drop shipper."
1,Buyer beware!,"This publication is full of nothing but advertizments for how-to mail order, get rich quick scheams. Nothing usefull here, if your seroius about starting your own mail order business, please...Buyer beware!"
1,Skip It!,Absolutely worthless! This overpriced pamphlet has very little worthwhile information. If I could give it zero stars I would.
1,Poor- Very Disappointing.,I had too much of hopes pinned on this book for my startup. All were shattered...I had particularly disgusting experience with one of the drop-shipper listed in this book...Anyways...I was too scared to try any other shipper mentioned in the book...Please refrain from buying this book. You will only repent !! _ Like I did ...
1,American Drop-Shippers Directory,I am very disappointed with this publication. I wish I had found these comments 5 days ago. I am looking for a drop shipper and wholesaler for Pet Supplies. Anyone out there that knows of such a publication or drop shipper PLEASE let me know. I'll be watching for comments concerning such publication or drop shipper.
3,It's OK I have successfully used it.,"I say OK because the work in finding the right info and company can be rather tedious. I wrote alot of the companies and check out some on the internet also. However, I did find a handful of companies that are very useful in starting and maintaining a business. I am using 2 companies now out of the book and have made some profits doing so! I was serious about doing it so I remained consistent in my search and it is slowly paying off!This book can be useful if you are serious about the drop-ship business. You must be patient and persistent and you will find some excellent companies. It will take alot of writing and searching but it will pay off!I recommend this book!"
2,sound quality poor,the CD's sound like someone copied old records and did not remaster to CD standards. I would not buy this again.
5,Empires at War,Fowler writes well and makes this epic and the players come alive. I never realized the supreme importance of the French and Indian War had to the history of our country. The author is extremely knowledgable but does not burden the reader with unrelated facts- a real art for an historian. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in American history.
3,"Not spectacular, but worth getting acquainted with","Not a bad little movie, though it sometimes moves uneasily between drama and comedy. For example, there's one scene where Bette Davis is vigorously shaking Miriam Hopkins in frustration, and though what we're seeing is undeniably shocking and violent, the cutesy music on the soundtrack is trying to tell us it's supposed to be funny. But, all in all, ""Old Acquaintance"" is a watchable, mostly polished affair, though it's certainly not up there with ""Dark Victory"", ""Now, Voyager"" and other Bette Davis classics. The DVD features a sharp, clean print, good sound, and the usual entertaining array of short subjects (including a cartoon) that might have been shown with the film back during its original release."
2,Broken box,"I was disappointed when I opened the package to find that the box was broken all on the bottom. I did a decent job taping it back together, for the disc looked like it was fine. So I wouldn't say I was impressed, at all."
5,We need more bands like this one!,"I like this CD a lot. The first song starts off a mood of a depressive floating state of mind and introduces some nice crunchy guitars to add spice at the right times. This is for fans of Goth, Rock, Pink Floyd (you can hear a heavy Pink Floyd influence throughout Visionaire, only make it a little heavier and doomy). ""Fragmented"" and ""Conquest"" are heavier songs to snap you away from the moodiness for a while until James comes along and transforms your mind state with his excellent writing and structuring skills. What can I say? This thing needs a few complete listens before you can capture all the depth on here but once you do, the mysteries will unfold! A must have for sure."
3,Hawaii snorkeling,"I guess you really can't complain about much when it some to the price of this camera. The casing is actually really nice. I took two rolls of film while in Hawaii and thought at least a few pictures would turn out pretty well. Not really, it seems that the flash doesn't always work making most of the pictures too dark to see anything. The one good thing is that if you scan the pictures into a comuter you can fix the color so they do look decent. But, twice the price for printing. Make sure that when you bring the camera under water that you wipe in front of the lens (little bubbles gather in the yellow circle). I have neevr tried disposable underwater cameras, so I have nothing to compare to. It's better than nothing I guess."
3,Huh?,"Who would have thought Rockeros Mana made in bachata, most of the tracks work out good as bachata I would say 80% of them. The 20% that are bad just sound odd in bachata. Not every song out there can be converted into bachata."
1,Can't they get their own music?,"It just goes to show that anyone can be a ""star"" now a days. Anyone can put any song to a salsa/merengue/bachata/grupera/reggae/etc soundtrack and sell an album.give me a break!"
1,Paper Feeder Jams ...,"I bought this printer for work about 8 months ago, mainly for the fax machine, and I would NOT recommend it (and I can't say I wasn't warned, either); the feeder part doesn't take the paper very well ... no matter how carefully you put it in... and I mean with ALL different qualities of paper, too. It ends up wrinkling the paper and then you definitely can't feed it in. I am a very patient person, but this fax machine has raised my blood pressure more times than I can describe! (Once you get your paper fed into it, the quality of the print is okay, though) Good luck, if you buy it, but don't say you weren't warned ... and I paid [$$$$] for this headache."
2,Not Windows XP Compatable,We bought the HP Officejet v40 to use with Windows XP as on the box it says that the printer is Windows XP compatable. The software that came with the printer was not for Windows XP. We had to call HP to order the free Windows XP drivers and followed the directions to the T. But the printer still will not print with Windows XP drivers and I am looking for another printer. And the next one will not be a HP printer.
4,"Good printer, installation pain","The quality of this printer is excellent. It performs faxing, copying, and printing like a champ. Ink cartridges seem to hold up with a fairly large capacity, and HP's design is easy to refill if necessary.Scanning is fast, and I can for the first time scan multiple pages into my applications which support it, like Acrobat.One complaint: Installation of this printer is a royal pain. You can usually count on redoing the installation at least once. It's very sensitive to Windows XP/2000 permissions.HP uses a custom USB port interface, which has blown up on me during installation of other software."
1,Beware inaccurate tech specs,"Beware! Amazon's Technical Details list ""Windows 2000"" as a system requirement. Note that this product's drivers do not run on Windows 2000 SERVER, only Windows 2000 PROFESSIONAL. Don't end up burned and disappointed by HP like I was. I have seen spec after spec of this printer say that it runs under ""Windows 2000"". That is less than half true at best, and downright misleading at worst."
2,Faulty printer,"Works fine to begin with, but I'll tell you now how yours will break if you buy one. The gear(s) controlling the service station will break causing the carriage to stop and grind during it's travel. Plenty of the V40s break this way and I doubt that any will be alive within the next year."
1,carriage jam,"We only had this printer for a little over a year and it no longer works. We have not used it extensively either. The carriage jam problem just showed up and now it is completely uselss. We now have to buy a new printer/copier/fax. I will not be getting an HP. We will also be getting a copier that you can lay the paper on flat, not a feed through. Save your money. I am very upset that I now have to buy a new printer."
2,Disappointing user,I owned three HP products including printer and scanner. And this one is the most disappointing product that I have. The feeder just does not work properly. Now I know what the problem is and I am going to buy a new one - not a HP this time.
1,"MY WORST PRINTER, EVER!!","Not much to say, especially NOT MUCH GOOD, to say about this Printer, horribly BAD, unreliable ""Performance,"" ... I Do NOT recommend it to anyone looking for a multifunction machine that will really be SOLID, and RELIABLE, to use!! ..."
3,not windows xp ready!,"I received this gift for Christmas and have enjoyed it ...However, please keep in mind that the drivers and software are NOT windows XP compatible. You can still utilize the front panel of the v40 to operate it but the full HP software is not available yet. If you are expecting ease of use when connected to your xp based PC ...well...it is not happening!"
4,Best multi-function printer for your money,"Unfortunately, HP discontinued this model. However, prints both documents and photos great. Works with XP, but you need to ensure you get the v40xi model. All other models will have compatibility issues."
2,Short of Specifics Certainly OVERPRICED!!!,This book is really not for anybody needing to learn the specifics on how to write and publish an E-book. Save your money and find better and free info online!!!!!
5,Absolutely the best!,I bought the volumes 1 and 2 twenty years ago from the back of the church bulletin. I couldn't be more happy that I did that. This is the most comprehensive book I have ever read on the lives of the saints. It is an excellent resource to have in your library! I am sorry Volume 1 does not seem to be available at this time. I would love to stock up on more of these.
2,Eh......,"Mediocre at best. I'd actually rate it at 2 1/2 stars. I like the graphics, but the gameplay is not all that ""smooth"". If you havn't bought it yet I'd wait until Aug and get 08. Hopefully they'll have it worked out by then. I definately miss the hot routes."
1,Not fun at all,"I really am dissappointed in the in the drastic changes made in madden 2007 on the ps3. Its frustrating navigating the layout not even to mention the new way to substitute players the audibles are different hot routes are different, button layouts were switched. Oh well guess i'll just be happy and satisfied with my old ps2 version for now."
4,Madden 07,Couldn't beat the price. Friend suggested I start with an earlier version and for less than 10 bucks got a new game in less than a week.
2,transitional project,"If you remember when Madden 2001 was released for the PS2, the game was still much better on the the PS1 simply because it was on the console for several years and the bugs were worked out and the gameplay was smooth. Seems that history has repeated itself in making the shift to the PS3. I purchased this recently used for about $13 and played it. I also played the PS2 version quite a bit and the gameplay and overall quality of the product is much better on the PS2 version. I quickly cut my losses and sold the PS3 version for about $8. At this point, I'm playing Madden 08 for the PS2 on my HDTV. Hey, it's just more fun that way. At least until they improve the quality of the PS3 version to a comparable level."
1,Madden 07 Aweful!!,"I have never experienced such a betrayal by an individual title in all of my gaming experiences from back in the Atari days. I owned a PS2 and owned the Madden 07 title for that console, (5 stars by the way) but this has been most disappointing of all experiences.Madden and the usual announcers are not there. Instead you get some crazy guy that sounds like a radio announcer. The game play is totally different, the franchise mode has lost over half of the cool functions of the game. Oh, did I mention that it has the same title as the PS2 version, but doesn't even come close to the quality of game play? The only thing that gives the game any credit is the graphics, and they look as if someone slapped it together in the 720 format hoping that the increase in definition would make up for the shortcomings. DO NOT purchase this title if you have owned previous Madden titles. I have owned them all for the series and this one is dead last in terms of game play and overall enjoyment."
2,Not ready for prime time,"If you're looking for a game to play head-to-head or don't care about Franchise mode, the game will be fine for you. The graphics are great and the gameplay is good for head-to-head mode, but everything else about the game is really, really bad.1) In Franchise mode, CPU teams sign Hall of Fame players to their team -- in a recent game against the Vikings, YA Tittle was the QB and Chuck Bednarik was on defense! This makes franchise mode almost unplayable.2) There is no way to edit player ratings3) There are no formation-specific substitutions4) The announcer is a generic radio voice -- no Madden!! (which may be a positive for some people)It looks like this game was rushed to market and is nowhere near a completed product. I'm back to playing Madden for the PS2 on my PS3."
2,Worse than Madden '05 on PS2,"I have been playing Madden '05 on my PS2 for 2 years. It's super fun to play and has great graphics, etc. I bought a PS3 and of couse the first game I grabbed was Madden '07. What a complete dissapointment. I expected something great and what I got was a step back. This doesn't even deserve the Madden name on it. Talk about throwing a game together too fast just to get it out...that's exactly what happened here. I suspect that Madden '08 on PS3 will be much, much better because this one is pathetic. The designers should be embarassed. However, this is pretty much par for the course with the PS3 games I've bought. Thank goodness I bought the PS3 for the blu-ray as well because the gaming is not what I expected by any means."
4,Better than Madden 94,"Maybe it's because the last Madden I played was Madden 94, but Madden 07 seems pretty good to me. It's only 720p though, which is unsurprising since this is just a port of the XBox 360 version. Graphics are decent but Madden 08 better be 1080p!!"
4,Not the traditional Madden Hit but acceptable...,"The controls are off and the motion sense is a pain in the butt; however, if you can get past the initial disappointment with the game and graphics then you will find it still a very fun game for the new PS3. Traditional Madden users had grown accustomed to a certain type of gameplay and this version is definitely much different. It is shockingly similiar to the Xbox 360 version. So, if you own the PS2 version os Madden 07, my suggestion would be to wait until the next year's release of Madden because this one was definitely a rush job and not worth your money. However, if you don't currently have 07 Madden then jump on this one to get ahead of the curve for next years release!!!!"
1,Madden NFL 07,"I will not order from amazon.com again. I purchased this game for a Christmas gift, and didn't realize that I had a game for the wrong playstation. The recipient of this gift made me aware when he opened it. I no longer have the box it was shipped in. The game is unopened, brand new, yet I'm not allowed to return it unless I have the original packaging. I am really disgusted. It is UNOPENED!!!!"
2,Hiding your plays,The main thing that got me on this game and i so regret buying it is that you can't hide your plays when you are playing 2player....thats so disappointing....they better fix this on the new madden game or i'm never buying another madden game ever!!!!
2,Causes Blisters,"Durable and High Quality, but cause blisters on both my sons' feet (one with a high instep and one without)...blisters on top of toes and heel...zip front shoes are better alternative."
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY!,"do not buy this product at any cost. if this has been given to you as a gift, throw it away or re-gift it to your sworn enemy. yes, it's that bad. i wish i could have given it no stars.i bought this dvd thinking it would be great. it's not. it's not a movie, it's not even something you'd see as a tv documentary, either. it's a powerpoint presentation! that's it! i could have made this in high school; and done it better. it's horrible!DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.i never write reviews on things and frankly don't believe in them, but this is so bad i had to tell everyone.and even though kanye is the best rapper out right now, he can't even save this one. that's why this dvd is called 'kanye west: unauthorized', 'cause kanye would never put his name on a piece of junk like this."
3,"Enjoyable CD, good selections, but not enough Pete!","Well done selections from the Cavern era, but if you are looking for Pete he's tough to find. First of all, he doesn't do any vocals, which is not a big deal. More importantly though, if you are looking forward to hearing the state of his chops behind the drums (as I was), that too is made difficult since his younger brother Roag doubles on drums. This dual drumming obviously prevents an assessment of Pete's ability to drive a band on his own. The album is enjoyable, though, and if you're a Pete fan you gotta have it."
4,Best of the rest of Best.......................,"If I were going to buy a Pete Best CD, this is the one I'd get....way over the others. It'll never make the charts...........but when they are gone...they're gone. Some of us old farts will take the cd and sing along in the car, so if you see our mouths moving and our heads shaking....some of the songs here are worth getting through traffic with."
5,Tom Petty Greatest Hits Tab,"Apart from loving his music, I have to start by saying that this is probably one of the clearest tab books I've ever learnt from. The tab is clear, the page turns are kept to a minimum and each part is broken down perfectly to learn. Where this book really excels though is in the first few pages of glossy photos, as well as a song by song analysis by Tom himself explaining how each song came about. You don't often get this in a tab book, and coupled with the clear notation this has to be one of the best tab books I've ever bought.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,Tom Petty cd,I got this for my buddy just so he would have something he realley liked on his haul to work every night.
1,Never Got It,I ordered this book awhile ago on Amazon. After a month I started to wonder whether they would ever ship it. I emailed them and they said they ran out and failed to tell me. They told me it would be another couple of weeks. Still never shipped....They gave me my money back but I was very upset at how much time I wasted on them. Don't order this because they probably don't have it.
3,Good enough story - 3.5 out of 5 Stars,"I enjoyed this book. Parts of it were truly engrossing. Kathryn Kyle and Jay Parker are nice characters (though a bit too Xena & Gabrielle like for their own good). Where the book is rocky is in the way so many flashbacks are dumped in the reader's lap in the first half of the book. Maybe it is just me, but flashbacks that completely stop action and take me back to a big melodramatic event years ago don't work very well when they are plunked unceremoniously into the middle of a character's mournful musings. This happens more than one time. I think maybe 6 or 7 times if I am remembering correctly.So while the book seemed pretty good by the end, it definitely is somewhat of struggle in the first half. I give it a 3.5 out of 5."
3,Not exactly what I'd expected.,"I was excited to get this smaller skillet and knew that the brand was a good one. But soon after, it started to get scorch marks on it that I could not get clean. It looks terrible but it is a good skillet anyway. For one or two people, it's the perfect size."
4,Anything Gungor is good,"Michael Gungor is a awesome singer/songwriter/musician period. This disc has some very good songs and arrangements that have Gungor's unique signature. From hugely popular worship songs like ""Friend of God"",""Here I am to worship"" and ""Meet with me"" to solid jems like ""It's Your love"", ""Move me"" and ""I am Yours"" this is a quality worship effort. If you're a guitar player pay paticular attention to ""Doxology"" and ""It's Your love"" Gungor has some serious guitar skills. You won't be disappointed with this project."
3,Professional Quality Santa Suit,Tried to contact sellers twice and they never replied. Suite was not complete and I had to run around like a maniac for the items not included so our little grandchildren could see Santa! Ended up spending $70. dollars.
1,WARNING!,"The description does say that ""this is an OCR edition with typos."" What the description doesn't tell you is the HUGE number of typos it contains, the unbelievably bad formatting (the footnotes are not at the foot of the page, the superscripts are given at line), etc.All in all, this looks more like something a child would do rather than a bona fide commercial endeavor. It's virtually unreadable. Save yourself time and money and use the Google Books version instead, which is a scan of the original and hence, unlike the version I bought, has a reliable TOC and index. The publisher of this edition should hang its sorry head in shame and refund my money! I just hope nobody else gets suckered into buying this."
5,Urban hip-hop dance in America from 1970's Break-Dancing to the 80's transition to 'easy-to-perform' party dances,"Director Moncell Durden's ""History and Concept of Hip-Hop Dance: The Street Culture that became a Global Expression"" is an examination of urban hip-hop dance in America from 1970's Break-Dancing to the 80's transition to 'easy-to-perform' party dances that appealed partygoers everywhere, to modern-day hip-hop in Afro-Latin communities' dancing and much more. Expert testimony on the origins and heritage of hip-hop dancing tap into the wisdom of choreographers, international dancers, and dance instructors. A celebration of this relatively recent and mutable global dance tradition with ancient roots, History and Concept of Hip-Hop Dance is an excellent, lively and educational addition to any college or personal DVD library with a focus on the history of dance. 43 minutes."
5,Great Book! Great Pictures!,"Not sure why anyone would give this book a low rating! It has page after page of great pictures, especially of Luna Park & Cedar Point. Highly recommended for any fans of old amusement parks!"
1,Ohio's Amusement Parks in Vintage Postcards,Presented a very narrow spectrum of the small amusement parks that thrived until well after the second world war.
5,Thorn's Challenge,"Tara was Thorn's challenge and he had no choice but to give in to his ""sweetest temptation."" Another great Westmoreland story. Brenda Jackson really knows how to tell a story. Keep sending us more Westmoreland's stories."
5,WOW! I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!,What was Tara thinking? Exchanging her virtue for some pics for charity. Well evidently she's smarter than me. 'Cause she ended up with the man. You go girl. Ms. Jackson I loved it.
5,Got a pulse? You will love this.,This is great music. The band is supremely competent and having a great time. Sit yourself down on a bench in the front row and enjoy!
3,Bourbon Street,It's hard to just listen when you have sen the group in person! But it is a great reminder of our fun time in New Orleans.
4,THE BEST TECHNO DANCE SONGS,"IF YOU LIKE UP-BEAT TECHNO AND LIKE TO DANCE, YOU WILL LOVE THIS. IT MAKES YOU GET OFF YOUR CHAIR AS SOON AS YOU HEAR THE BEAT! ENJOY!"
4,Good techno track,"Nice techno track, but the beat can get annoying after a while though. Check it out if you haven't heard it yet!"
4,Yeah!,"This single rocks! You can dance to it all the time. It is already very popular and being played on the radio a lot, which should be happening because it rules! You should really buy this CD, because you can never get sick of it and always dance to it.... Soon Alice Deejay will be poping out, so you should but this single soon! But there is one exception, you have to like dance to like this song! If you don't then you will hate this so you have to like dance, and if you do this is the heavenis single!"
2,Why do people like this?,"If you are going to repeat 2 lines over and over throughout an entire song, couldn't you at least pick something more original than ""talk to me"" and ""do you think you're better off alone""? They could have at least picked two cryptic lines other than something that is straight-forward and boring. I don't understand how people could listen to this song outside of a club. The music isn't even that great, it is very generic and stays constant throughout the entire song. I gave this song 2 stars because I suppose if you were at a club and intoxicated it could be good to dance to."
1,There was No Icon for Zero Stars,"A true flop. This work of ostensible scholarship is poorly researched, sporadically argued, and clumsily written. The language is awkward and the book, as a whole, is a bore. I cannot recommend this work to anyone; it fails on every level. It is pretentious and underwhelming. For all of its bluster, ""Islands and Exiles"" might have been called ""Islands of Excrement."""
3,LIES!!,The color LIES. It's not the same as the picture. And it barely fit my seat. -_- But I kept it anyways cuz I liked the little separate head cover thing.
3,too easy,For a intermediate class I personally thought it was not challenging enough physically. This video is more into the flexibility side of yoga instead of power side. I do believe it is an excellant beginner's video.
3,good video but awful to look at,"Stephanie Keach is a good instructor but the video is so drab and with such low production value that it is painful to sit or exercise through. The video is shot with a plain blue background. For yoga enthusiasts who don't care, then this is a great video but for ordinary folks that need some inspiration and motivation, it will only collect dust on your shelves."
3,Superman & Lois Lane,"I watched this series when it was first on TV. Now that I have watched the DVDs, I can honestly say that I enjoyed the first season, & maybe the second season. Clark Kent is Superman! Once Lois knows about it, he grovels around like a sick puppy in love; and she takes control of his life. I couldn't wait to finish the third season."
2,Not like they used to be.,"My Chilton Nissan Pathfinder manaul that I bought in 2002 is the best and most detailed non-factory shop manual I have ever seen. Unfortunately the new ones are not the same. One of their bean counters who has never actually worked on his own car thought it would be a great idea to shrink everything down in size to save a few pennies on printing costs. I can live with the smaller main text, but for most of the exploded diagrams you need a magnifiying glass (and for some a microscope) to read them. Luckily there are lots of good used (and new) factory shop manuals out there at reasonable ""buy it now"" prices."
4,new old mystic,"sultry minor keys in a post-blues framework meets jewish (read: middle eastern - dispite political divide the music is from same tradition) harmonics... blend in subtle guitars and modern (almost hiphop at times) rhythms... a solid listen, variety of dynamics within the muted yet rich pallette Wall chooses. an album of depth, flow, and sometimes even groove."
5,Standard cable...,"It is exactly what it appears to be...If you are using a lazer printer with parallel hook ups available, buy a parallel cable and use it.They are way, way faster than USB!"
2,Hobit feet,These were to complete a Halloween costume. The feet fit but he had great difficulty keepingThem on his feet. Wish I didn't waste the money.
5,great find,"It's very silly looking, which is what we were going for (as opposed to authentic). Worked great for skit props!"
3,Good read,"I enjoed his book even though Dick Bernier spends way to much time trying to convince you that he is a ""Living Legend"" But since there are still not alot of Deer tracking books on the market it is the price you pay. But I would read the Benoit one first."
3,"Great item, HORRIBLE/Unresponisve Amazon Customer Service","Great item as described, could almost be used a back-up carry-on bag for air travel (if stuffed would be oversized as a personal item/backpack but is flexible enough). Very well-made as well with lots of compartments.Regarding price, I would watch this item until it gets around $8-12 range, and it will get in that range in this style or the black/blue style. Amazon screwed me by not following its own stated 30-day price guarantee policy and refused a refund when the item went down -- and refused me even the courtesy of a response on my follow-up email (not a good sign given that the holiday shopping season is ahead)."
1,Painful walk down memory lane.,"Merchant Prince II is a painful twisted mutation that sends most old Machiavelli fans packing. The core of the game is good, because it's the old one. However, the new interface is awkward, the trade routes don't work as well anymore (Especially in Multiplayer), and crashing is always right around the corner.Yet again, this is an excellent example of a product not tested enough before it hit the shelves. However, what makes this case of lackluster testing really offensive is that there was a base game built approximately 6 years ago. The game did not change that much, so how can you take a working old game, totally screw it up and then release it as a working product? Save your money, or better yet, build an old DOS system and find the old game, and play that."
2,"Coulda, woulda, shoulda.","Here's another game that has a wonderful story line and great potential, but doesn't live up to it's promise. First, a skimpy manual that leaves out a lot of ""how to's"" and offers no hints or suggestions for good game play. Also, alas, no tutorial. Second, no on-line help. Want to know how to do something -- then try trial and error (and hope you can remember), 'cause that's all there is. Finally, bugs. Lot's of 'em. And commands that don't work. And commands that, I think, should be there, but aren't. There is a patch, but you can't tell if it has been applied (no version number appears at start-up). And on my machine at least, the game was worse after I ran the patch. All this is a shame, because this COULD have been a outstanding game."
3,Here we go again.,"Merchant Prince 2 is a fun, absorbing and informative game for you who have never played this type of discovery/trading/diplomacy/war game. There are a few nice new twists dealing with the Roman Catholic church. The movement and graphics are years out of date. I would be most eager to play against live opponents, rather than alone. Then you can consentrate on strategy instead of the familiarity or weaknesses. Good enough for the price."
5,T.D. Jakes what more can I say.,Once again T.D. Jakes puts his heart out there.Each chapter was well written and covers several areaswe as Christians need to hear about but a Sunday sermon never covers.I highly recommend this must read book.
5,I love this book!!,Another great book from T.D Jakes. He really opens you mind up to have a closer relationship with the Man above. And to know your value and worth.
4,Crhome,Alright chrome zephyr pros:accesorrie good perfect control add a power buckle to it awsome or add a dragon magazine also good but i warn ya the more ya add on the weaker attribute gets
4,great 1 handed shot,this b daman is great for the players who want to master the one handed shot. it has some wing thingy in the back that makes it easier for a one handed grip.
3,looks nice,"ok ive got this b daman, but i didnt bought the one with the direct hit figure. the problem of this toy that the stickers stuffs up easly once you try out the toy, and im bit dissapiointed on that, mostly i want to keep it in good condition with my other toys like beyblade"
2,more of a tale than a biography,"I've long been amazed by the whirlwind but industrious life of miss Victoria, but I must say that I felt I was misled by whomever placed this book in the catagory of biography. However that is my only beef with it. I'm uncomfortable when a biography uses dialog that can not have possibly been recorded and the is used for fact. It reads more along the lines of a Mark Twain yarn and I feel that this should be noted for those who whould rather have the factual biography of this amazing woman. The adventures of her life are entertaining enough, they need no embellishment!"
5,Great Marco compilation CD.,"But then again, can't expect nothing but greatnest from El Buki. These are all his hits since he left Los Bukis. Nothing but the best. Great compilation if you don't already own the rest of his CDs. I probably wont buy it just cuz i own everyone of his cds since he came out with Los Bukis which are 23 (Not counting compilations). Buy it now!!!Gran copilacion de Marco Antonio, aunque no se puede esperar nada mas que lo mejor de El Buki major. Estos son todos sus exitos desde que se separo de Los Bukis. Buena copilacion si no tienes el resto de sus CDs. Puede que no lo compre como ya tengo todos sus CDs desde su comienzo con Los Bukis lo cual son 23 (Sin las copilaciones). Compralo ya!!!"
4,La Mejor Coleccion Marco Antonio Solis,"I enjoy the music, the lyrics, and Marco Antonio's voice.I have enjoyed this CD very much."
4,Creative Thoroughly Tested,The content of this book helps even the most creative teacher find a way to build a substantial framework for teaching movement to all ages. I especially like the template included in the book for writing your own lesson plans. I have tried many of the ideas as well as the lesson plan sequence suggested in this book out and it all seems to work well.
3,I've used a lot of latex... And this wasn't the best.,"While the quanity is excelent, this is the thinest latex I have ever purchased. Plus it dries kind of sticky, which I've never encountered before. I mix it with my thicker Casting latex to do molds and it is much more useful then. A little disapointed, but for the money it's not bad.Signed,William A. McDonald"
5,Awesome...just completely awesome.,"Very easy to understand, even for a newbie to Tennis like me! It's really emotional. That's the problem with reading it in study hall. I'd start cracking up in the midst of total silence, or crying. I always know when I've got a good book by how much it moves me. This book is one of the best I've ever read. Pete Sampras rules, and so does this book!!! -Sunny"
3,THERE ONCE WAS A MAN NAMED DAVE...,"Okay, in this movie it is Clive and if you are familiar with the dirty limerick then you know this story. A woman (Casey Leet) dies in a car accident only to be found by a hillbilly (Nick Searcy). Her sister (Joelle Carter) and boyfriend (Matt Keeslar) set out to find her.What makes this low budget film good is that they bothered to create memorable characters instead of using just bodies to read lines. I enjoyed listening to whatever gems the town folk were going to come up with next. The problem with the story is that the plot dragged along too much. The ending needed to be stretched out and have a good hook. The title of the movie is a bit misleading as the ""cold Storage"" aspect wasn't utilized enough to make it the title.No f-bombs that I recall. No sex or nudity."
4,Back woods inbreed mumble mouth Hillbillies,"Do not mess with those back woods inbreed mumble mouth Hillbillies, being out of touch with reality can mess up your social skills to say the least.Our main man Clive (Nick Searcy) is one out of touch and crazy boy and he has love on his mind. Nick Searcy who plays Clive is 100% convincing as a twisted redneck freak and had me squirming in my chair and thinking this is one nasty foul smelling odd ball. When a missing young lady's wimp of a boy friend and bad to the bone sister go looking for her they find Clive in all his sick glory and the fight is on. Good low budget movie with a group of fine actors make this worth a look, heck you will be planing your next vacation around Clive's Bed and Breakfast."
2,Typical Playboy Production,"If you never saw this Playboy Video, you didn't miss a thing. This video, is like most of the others in the series: a total waste of time. Sure, the women are beautiful; Karen Foster, Peggy McIntaggart and Helle Michaelsen are some of the hottest Playmates of all time. But, Playboy's obsession with jump-cutting, quick zooms in and out and dark lighting and backgrounds make this an exasperating experience. You get few if any satisfying views of these Playmates.Forget this, and get a Hot Body or Soft Bodies video; those are guaranteed to get your juices flowing."
3,Not enough,"there are some majorly beautiful and sexy chicks in this one,and it's a shame that PB doesn't do them justice. Customers buy thesevideos for quality time looking at breasts, bottoms, feminine curves topped off by pretty faces and pleasing performances. I judge PB videos by the number of moments worth freezeframing or running in slow motion -- the more the hotter the better the more satisfying. By that standard, this isn't a great video. A few good moments in the Tina Bockrath and Helle Michaelsen videos, but not enough of Karen Foster or of a mouth-watering specimen like Bonnie Marino."
3,"Read the description. It is honest, and you're getting what you're paying for.","The Amazon product description clearly states that this is DVD-R, which means that it is a no-frills copy of (most probably) a VHS on DVD. Unfortunately, cheap copies are likely to be the only way this film will ever be on DVD. Let's face it, even ""Ode To Billie Joe"" is just now getting an official DVD release.By the way, some marketplace sellers are listing a single disc with ""Jory"" and two other westerns on it - ""Little Moon And Jud McGraw"" and ""Boothill."" The quality is certainly no better, as this copy of ""Jory"" is also obviously from a VHS, with the occasional jitter and color that sometimes appears just slightly off.If you want to see the movie for the first time, or didn't pick it up on its VHS release, it is well worth buying for the prices being asked. Both for the Robbie Benson fan and the fan of '70's style westerns."
1,Poor video quality.,"The storyline is as good as I expected, but the video itself was very poor. As if copied wrong. I prefer the book fo that very reason........"
1,A bad video on DVD,"I was thrilled to find out that Robby Benson's first major film was released on DVD as I had never seen it before on video, tv or elsewhere. But it was a very disappointing surprise. It looks like a very bad copy of the video printed directly onto the DVD. I wouldn't recommend bying this DVD."
1,Jory DVD,Jory DVD with Robbie Benson is very poor Sound & Picture quality. Sound and Video fade in and out like a cheap copy. If this was an original DVD then the manufacture cannot reproduce a quality copy from the film version. DO NOT PURCHASE.
3,The Merriweather Girls,A good evenings read short and fun. Again one I would let my grandchildren read. I like the spirit of adventure.
1,"can,t remember the title",i felt this was dull add it to the young readers groups i never finished it. don.t likekiddie pic nicks
5,This is not a toy,"This is not a toy, I did not buy it for a child. I bought it for my brother who is in his 40's. He was a fan of ""Lost in Space"" when we were kids. This robot looks similar. I don't have the robot in front of me but if I had to guess, it's about 6"" tall. It's a bit fragile but he loves it."
1,Not worth the $30...flimsy and falling apart,"I just bought this for my husband who likes robots, for Christmas. It's cute as can be, but the praise ends there. First of all, in packing, it was just tossed in shipping box, with no packing material, when I recieved it, it had fallen out of it's own box, and had been tossed around. It's basically a cheap piece of tin. I haven't given it to hubby yet, a it's the 22nd, but as I was wrapping it, one of the antenae fell off. I am VERY disapointed with this item, and really don't want to pay to ship it back...but this is ALOT of money for an item that isn't worth $1.98. HI might be able to glue the part back on, but for this price, it should at least not fall apart before I even WRAP it!"
3,Good,Only two songs on the CD? For 8 bucks? Hmmm. I guess I didn't realize this when I bought it. Not a very good deal as far as price goes. Oh well. Got to love Jason Mraz any way you can find him.
2,Could have been special,"This could have been a really good family movie except that it has no link to reality. There are no mountain towns in North Carolina without hospitals or access to medical care and the child of the female mayor in the story would not have used the grammar she did. Maybe, 100 years ago, there would have been such a place."
3,dougv,"An excellent movie. Well acted and good story.One problem, which stopped me from giving it a 5 star rating: The voices were often hard to hear, so I had to turn upthe volume to almost maximum to hear what they were saying. At times you had to quickly turn down the volume or hurtyour ears."
5,gentle medicine,"Nate (Aidan Mitchell) is a quiet and withdrawn ten year old boy. His father, Evan Gibbs (Cameron Bancroft) is an ambitious paediatrician who has buried himself in his work since the recent death of his wife. His boss, a subtle fatherly type, sees what is going on, and convinces Evan that the best way to secure promotion is to set up and run a free clinic for children in a small mountain town.This is a gentle, soothing film, with real drama and real warmth."
3,First Bujold experience,"Interesting and well-written book, with humor and wit. I had not read any of the prior books in the series; hence, it took a few chapters to get aligned to the names and places in this SciFi novel; but, once I caught on, it moved quickly. A Good Read!"
5,Miles does it again!,"I want MORE...whats next? What ELSE could Miles possibly get involved in? Bujold manages to make political infighting fun, funny, entertaining and exciting. I want to know what happens to the Better Butter Bugs, I want to know how Mark does from here, I want to know what happens to Nikki, is Ivan gonna get Miles' job after what he manages to pull off? I WANT MORE MILES!!! :) Thank you to Bujold for a wonderful cast of characters that never fail to entertain."
5,'A Comedy of Biology and Manners' indeed!,"The allusions to previous episodes in the life of Miles make the story richer (as in when the Vicerene drags out a certain old couch), but it has all the hallmarks of a classic, self contained ""Miles"" story. All of the old gut-wrenching changes in altitude and attitude - and a deft handling of character and life that I am just now (after 10 books and mumble-many years) beginning to appreciate.Miles finds his road to maturity rocky. . . dosen't everyone? But with an assured happy ending, it *still* took me by surprise at the way it all worked out with logic, self-consistency, and characters that ring true. If you don't know what you're missing, think back to the last novel that made your heart ache for the fictional characters as much as it does for real ones in your own life. I cannot stress this enough - READ THESE BOOKS."
4,Marriage Proposal as combat drop mission,"Miles Vorkosigan is back on Barrayar as is Ekaterin Vorsoisson. As a new widow, she wants her mourning year. Miles is afraid that with her beauty and the shortage of women on Barrayar that she'll marry someone else so he has a cunning plan. He's going to court her but not let her know.Mark Vorkosigan is back for the Emperor's wedding and he's starting up a new business -- bug butter. Of course, his romance with Kareen Koudelka was fine on Beta Colony but on Barrayar it's come to a halt.Gregor Vorbarra is getting married and the ettiquette people are dusting off some of the screwiest pieces of history to try out at the wedding.This has got to be one of the funniest of the Miles Vorkosigan books. I laughted til I cried, then cried in embarrassment for the characters and laughted some more. Don't just sit there get this book and read it."
4,Couldn't put it down -- but wasn't what I wanted...,"Don't get me wrong -- I love Miles. I love Ekaterin. I love parts of this book. (Especially the letter of abject apology and the scene in the Council of Counts.) But I missed the action and danger of the previous novels. At the very least, I expected those horrible bugs to infest Vorbarr Sultana... and it didn't happen. I agree with one of the other reviewers who didn't believe that a man with Miles' experience in covert ops would have told every person on the planet about his ""secret plan"" to woo Ekaterin. I look forward hopefully to the next novel, in the expectation that Miles' continued romance with Ekaterin will be interspersed with a return to Vorkosigan's fascinating duties as Imperial Auditor."
2,"Sadly, the title is accurate","Simply puts, its a comedy not a Miles adventure. Miles is there with his usual flair, and most of what he does aproximates the quality of the previous books. But everything that goes on around Miles, and there is a lot of it, is a bad joke. Whenever I would get interested in Miles' amorous complications, some off the wall plot would jump up, like butter bugs or sex change operations. I hope Bujold doesn't write any more Miles Vorkosigan comedy."
3,Other Books,"If you like a chick, occasionally it is a good idea to tell her.Especially before you are in the middle of a formal situation and the M word might blurt out. A pretty lightweight part of the series this one, and you could easily skip it, as both of the M brothers try and sort out themselves and the various female acquaintances that they are keen on.In this situation, they decide to become mummy's boys so she can use some of her wiles against the various potential in-laws standing in the way."
1,Disapointing,"The last book of Miles saga is definetly the most disapointing. I used to be a great fan of Miles an Bujold serie. But this time I found nothing relevant in the story, no real character development, nothing."
2,"Do NOT buy this if you want action, kidnapping, or battles.","The book is a collection of love stories about Miles, Gregor, and the Koudelka sisters. The typical action sequences in other Bujold books do not start here until page 338 in the 405 page hardcover edition."
3,A good read but enough of the misandry already!,"This book is yet another fun read by Bujold but her rampant misandrony is becoming the dominant theme of her work. Males, particularly white, heterosexual, ones without massive physical or mental/emotional damage, are over and over again portrayed as complete idiots that need to be rescued or straightened out by strong women. While I gladly ignored her complete lack of knowledge about matters military (which she admits) in the first books, because they were rather well written and side-splittingly funny, her hatred/contempt for males is getting too much to ignore. Her only really smart/competent characters are women and especially women who make better men than men do!If my information is correct, Ms. Bujold went through a particularly nasty divorce and this would explain the misandry. May I suggest some therapy so we get more scenes such as Miles' dinner party and less of the bile?"
4,Entertaining comedy for Bujold fans,"Bujold's Vorkosigan series is one of the best things going in science fiction. This entry is lighter, less serious, and somewhat less exciting than others. While not reaching the heights achieved by classics such as The Warriors Apprentice and Vor Game, this book still entertains. While at times the book strains to achieve a consistent tone, it is filled with humor, well-drawn characters, and Bujold's trademark epigrams.If you haven't read the other Vorkosigan books, I wouldn't recommend starting here. If your not sure whether you'll like this book, the publishers web site has 10 chapters online..."
5,"Miles may be a genius, but he is his worst enemy in love","Since my intoduction to Miles in Warriors Apprentice, I have read all of the books in the series. Each book is different, which is necessary, because the character grows up and changes in each book. In Civil Campaign, the author has set a new high. Miles has outgrown his past and has settled into his new life and he has a new love. The only problem is that he has told everyone about his plans, except her. Miles, being Miles has a great plan, but he has forgotten that great plans can be disastrous if they don't work! Predictably, the plan fails and that is the last predictable thing about the book. This book has everything from sex changes to the sins of countesses long dead and it all fits together. This is the best book yet. But a word of advice, read it twice - you miss too much at one reading. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK."
5,Great Book,The bug scene had me rolling on the floor. Book was as described and came when it was supposed to.
5,The funniest book of the Vorkossigan series,"Having read the book a second time I have to admit that my first impression two years ago was wrong. Then I felt somewhat let down, because it was not so strong a book as ""Komarr"" or ""Memory"". Well, that may still be so but now I discovered what a brilliant book this is.It's subject is not only the campaign Miles wages to capture Ekaterine's heart and hand, there is much more: sub-plots and stories about Mark, Ivan, a count's succession struggle, the Imperial wedding ... It's just a great panorama of Barrayar: colorful, full of suspense and romance.Oh, and then this is probably the funniest Vorkossigan book of them all. Some of the scenes are just hilarious! Some are almost too much: the scene when Miles gets his Ekaterin could be from a Frank-Capra-movie.My advice: buy it, read it, enjoy it!"
5,She just keeps getting better & better,"I loved this book. It had everything gut splitting humour, food fights, political intrigue, and regency romance. It's one of those books that once you start reading it you just can't stop and when you do finish you want more. I want more and so will you."
5,"""A Comedy Tonight""","The frothy (and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny) ""A Civil Campaign"" is the next to last (so far) in the saga of Miles Vorkosigan. If ""Komarr,"" the previous novel in the series, was the darkest, ""A Civil Campaign"" is the lightest. The author bills it as ""A Comedy of Biology and Manners,"" and that's precisely what it is. Call it a ""space operetta,"" if you like.Ms. Bujold centers this take around Miles's pursuit of the hand of Ekaterin, widowed at the end of ""Komarr,"" which really should be read before you tackle this one. And there are subplots inivolving Miles's clone brother Mark, designer goody-producing insects, and much intrigue concerning the various members of the Council of Counts, among them Count Dono, who--err, no. Best not to spoil the fun. Suffice it to say that all ends well."
5,Miles Vorkosigan: Swimsuit Edition,"If this book was a Shakespeare play, it would be ""Much Ado About Nothing"". It's like extracting all the light moments from all the death and mayhem of the previous Vorkosigan books and concentrating them into into one -- and five stars for that, because it's been done so well. Bujold tends to make her characters realistic, believable people, even the minor ones. The one part which I think goes over the top in silliness is the bug butter.That said, this is not a good entry point to the Vorkosigan series, because if you're not familiar with the background, you'll be wondering why Bujold chose to write SF if she just wanted to write a romance novel with a minimum of spaceships and plasma arcs. But for those who are fans already, well, we've all wanted to see Miles find a Lady Vorkosigan at last."
3,Good but I expected more,"I was a little disappointed in this book. While it was enjoyable, Miles just did not seem like himself. It was as if the author had put him on Ritalin.My favorite of all the books is still The Warrior's Apprentice, because it has all the difficult characters like Sergeant Bothari, and Mile's Grandfather. They are deeply flawed characters whom you still care about."
4,Miles at his best again,"It was lovely to read 'A Civil Campaign' like coming back to see an old friend. It has been a pleasure to watch Miles grow into the person he is in this latest book. Ms Bujold carefully weaves a comedy of manners with treasonous plots with great dexterity, and I can say that after reading this book the next thing I did was....read it all over again! I'll be going back to it again very soon and waiting with bated breath for the next one which will be when I wonder?..."
4,Pretty darn good for a chick book,"When I first read the cover slip and all the talk about romances I settled in for a long, boring read. Well, I finished it in one day. Very amusing. And entertaining, which surprised me cause there are no space battles or the like. I envision Ms. McMaster Bujold writing about the Vorkosigan family for years to come. Miles deserves to be a parent of some kind of misfit kid."
5,Go Miles! Go Mark! Go Simon!Ivan? Ivan? Find SOMEONE!,"How not to love Miles? Ivans are a dime a dozen - we women are all looking for a Miles. Luckily I have one,"
5,Try it,"I didn't want to like this book. This is only the second book of this series that I have read (the other was Memory), and I approached it with some trepidation given that, from the illustration and intro copy on the cover, it almost feels more like romance than sci-fi. But I must admit that at times I found myself howling with laughter, and at other times almost moved to tears. The central dinner party is truly one of the funniest scenes I have read in a long time, and the climactic council scene successfully brought the various elements of the story to a satisfying conclusion. The central characters are likable and Miles certainly demonstates an admirable capacity to learn from his mistakes. Highly recommended."
4,Aan excellent novel!,"Miles is out to conquer the world -- or at least his lady's heart. But, its not just a romance, but a complex social and political restructuring that requires Miles to maintain his wits about him. And, with the hapless mistakes of a youngster in love, he loses his wits frequently. So he tumbles through the arena he's previously sailed through -- providing us with a unique perspective on the beloved character. I highly recommend this book, but suggest starting with the first of this series, so that the comparisons are more clear."
5,Hilarious and heartfelt,"I read the first ten chapters on Baen's web site and immediately bought the hardcover. My husband did the same, so we now have two copies...and have each read it about four times in less than a week. I am *so* glad Bujold is letting Miles grow up, become an adult, and have to face the consequences of his actions. And the butter bug subplot - ! Stunning. Absolutely stunning. My only complaint was the hideous cover art, but that's besides the point. Somehow I think Dorothy, Georgette, Charlotte and Jane would be proud."
5,Bujold becoming the Jane Austen of science fiction,"Lois McMaster Bujold has been the best writer of characters in science fiction for years, but with this book she moves completely away from action and into the never-before written area of drawing room-SF-comedy. Delightfully plotted, wonderful characters, great plot twists. It's as good as her best books (probably *Barrayar* and *Memory* -- but my opinions change depending on what I read most recently). It seems odd to say so, but this is the closest to a Jane Austen book ever attempted in science fiction, I'm sure.Over the years, I've read each of Lois's books at least twice. Her weakest books are still pretty entertaining, and her best books shine in the memory for weeks afterwards. At times the world of Miles Vorkosigan seems as real as my own.You can't start with this book; but please go back to her earlier books. And don't plan anything else for a few weeks."
4,Delighted me despite my misgivings.,"After reading the first eight chapters on the Baen website, I was prepared to be mightily disappointed by LMB's newest offering. Instead of the edge-of-your-seat excitement of Komarr or the introspection of Memory, A Civil Campaign starts out sounding like a Gilbert and Sullivan farce. Much to my surprise (and delight), however, once LMB finished making my sides hurt from laughing, she settled down into a delightful adventure and a lovely satire. Who would have thought the Countess still had that old couch sitting around...Readers will appreciate the touches LMB has added to the characters of Gregor and Nikki; they both start actually doing things, instead of being mere reasons for others to act. Mark's role is a bit disappointing, though, and lacking in depth."
4,I Miss Admiral Naismith,"This was a very good book, and I will take the Vorkosigans any way I can get them. I do miss the adventures of Admiral Naismith and the Dendarii raiders. The problem that Ms.Bujold has is measuring up to her earlier fabulous Vorkosigan books. This book was a bit predictable. In my humble opinion, I think we need a good interstellar war to jumpstart this series. This is still far superior writing than 95% of current scifi. I hope she continues to give us one per year. Excellent enterntainment."
3,"Enjoyable, but fairly predictable","I'm a HUGE fan of Miles & Co. A Civil Campaign is very enjoyable, but we don't get a great amount of character development--except with Ivan. Is it just me? Or does Ivan get smarter with each book? Don't read the rest of this review if you haven't read the book yet.I wish we had more about Cordelia (my fave character) and Aral. And Mark isn't appealing (I liked him in Mirror Dance)...why would Kareen be interested in him?The butter bugs were the predictable part of the book. Once introduced, I already ""knew"" that they would be engineered with the Vorkosigan slogan, and then escape. It could have been much funnier.But, Ms. Bujold, keep it coming. I just love your characters."
1,Boring!,"I love Halloween, pumpkins, great illustrations, good stories whether they're 400,000 or 40 words. I frequently buy children's books for their illustrations. This book was a huge disappointment. I didn't find the illustrations imaginative or interesting. Lots of pumpkins, none with interesting faces. They floated through the air after the kids went to sleep...big deal. This book could have been fun. It definitely wasn't."
4,"Beautiful practitioner, ugly studio set!","Although the studio set is less inspiring, Stephanie Keach is a beautiful practitioner. She is an excellent instructor with a calm, compassionate voice. Her wisdom and guidance of this gentle flow is great for all levels. I appreciate that she takes the time to prepare your body by properly warming it up. She continually encourages you to focus on your pranayama (breath) because that is your best teacher. If you start to lose your ujjayi (deep, rhythmic breath) you are pushing too hard and that is not yoga! This video mainly focuses on ground work (locust/stick asanas). There are Sun Salutations for warming up the body, but no other standing asanas like warrior/tree/shoulderstand poses. Overall, a nice gentle flow video that allows you to grow from within."
2,"Good for a laugh, but not always that great","Lately, I've been disappointed with almost every issue of Revolver. It seems to get so much more boring every issue and they always favor the ""in"" bands at the moment. I won't be missing this being in my mail when I don't renew my subscription."
1,It took 5 months for the first issue to be sent.,"I am still waiting for the first issue. I bought in January, and it says I am not getting anything till May.That is plain ridiculous. Should say that from the beginning."
3,Meh,"I was looking for a good magazine to keep up on new metal bands and what not. I really wanted to get Metal Hammer, but since I am in the states it is pretty spendy. I have gotten my first two issues and my intitial response is: meh. It really covers the mainstream metal, which I am not really into, granted I like some of it. If you want to get updates on what your local proclaimed metal radio station plays, this is the magazine for you. If you are wondering what Lord Ahriman does in his spare time, look elsewhere. It's better than Rolling Stone, but that's really not saying much."
5,Freddie King Is One Of The Greatest.........................,"Freddie King's Just Pickin' is the fundamental for any blues guitarist to learn, and cherish. I just came across a copy and was so excited to here his music from both of his instrumental albums. Freddie King was Stevie Ray Vaughan biggest influence he got all of his material from most of this stuff including Hide Away, and Sen-Sa-Shun. Any blues guitarist should pick up this copy right away and learn the best way to expand your notation as a musician this is the very best!!! Im gonna Highly Recomend this one to anybody wanting to here a pure guitar genius, he is one of the greatest!"
4,"Awesome picking, poor remastering","The music is awesome; this guy wrote the book on blues instrumentals. Can be enjoyed by anyone who likes the guitar, whether or not they are into the blues. Freddie King was the epitome of taste and technique.However, the remastering on this album is subpar compared to the material here that has appeared elsewhere (Hideaway: The Best Of Freddie King, for instance), and though the CD proclaims that this is in stereo, it is not.However, I still commend Modern, whoever they are, for making this available. It has amazingly been in print for almost 20 years"
4,Works as a Novelty Album but Not Worth the $20,"I love Freddie King and as a guitar players he is one of my heroes. This is an all instrumental album that is not from Freddie Kings peak. The guitar work is nice but really does not give King the recognition he deserves for his genius. I order this album, paid $20, and waited for about two months to get it and in all honesty was really disappointed. If your looking for the true genius of Freddie King get his later albums or Smokey Smothers album Back Porch Blues on which Freddie plays lead guitar but does not sing. I don't mean that you should not buy this album if you are a Freddie King fan but if this is your introduction do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
1,Ooh Wee,"Do not purchase this DVD. My son look at me as if he were saying... are you kidding, I'm not looking at the garbage. This DVD was soooo boring."
2,Brainy Baby - Peek-A-Boo,"It's OK and occasionally keeps my grandaughter's interest. Honestly, it's pretty boring compared to the Baby Einstein products because it doesn't have any puppets."
5,What I was looking for,"I am not a fan of parking a kid in front of the TV. But at 9 months we started introducing some signing videos to our son and we wanted a few other videos that were educational because I had seen other children benefit from the sign language and other educational series. He is 11 months and it keeps his attention. I don't let him watch regular TV but about every other day for 30 minutes he switches between Baby Einstein videos, Signing Videos and These series. This series is by far the best bang for your buck as they aren't as expensive as the baby einstein and in my opinion they are just as good if not better."
4,Learn to see London through new eyes,"This book is of interest to anyone who has ever lived in London. Using mainly intuition, Sinclair takes us on a psychogeographical open-top bus journey down the city's darker alleys, parks and thoroughfares. (In)famous Londoners are deconstructed. My only gripe would be the lack of referencing to Dickens, who has been there before, and knew all about it."
1,"Functions, but low quality","Installed this unit and the first thing noticed was the noise when engine was running. The previous deck didn't have any noise. Could be spark plugs or wires but suspect due to very cheap construction this unit is sensitive to noise on the 12vdc. Installed a large cap across the 12v and this helped a little, may have to get better noise filter.If you remove media the unit doesn't seem to remember which track was playing, so it starts over at the beginning of the usb drive or sd card - frustrating.The radio tuner is odd, it's like old fashioned manual tuning, works but seems almost like it would have been easier just to make it like every other deck on the market, unless it's supposed to be nostalgic.So yeah it works but not without several flaws, I'd not do it again - I'd put the $40 sum bucks toward a better unit."
3,"Not bad for the price, but...","The radio receiver is lacking at best. I have upgraded since this purchase and I get three times the amount of stations with the new stereo that cost three times as much, and the sound clarity is much better."
2,Should've listened to the other reviews,"I bought this for my boyfriend when he had his cd player stolen. He found it and thought it would be a good unit to plug his ipod into, which is what he listens to in his car. We decided to give it a try despite the reviews. He installed it and mentioned there was some noise coming from the unit. When I got in to listen to it, it was awful. It's enough to drive you to a homicidal rage. The prospect of listening to it for an entire car trip wasn't great, so he switched back to another unit, and we're going to return this one. Too bad...it was a low price for what looked like a simple product."
1,LR192 Radio Review,"I bought this car mp3 sd receiver in the summer,First thing the power button didn't workafter get the power button fixed, when you turn on the stereoits play ok, but when driving only thing you can hear is whistling,humming and barely hear the radio or the mp3 playing.I don't like this stereo at all."
2,"Interesting, but flawed","This book provides an interesting look into the investigation of an unthinkable crime, but it also has mistakes. Some can be attributed to typographical errors, but editing should have picked these up. One discrepancy in particular should have sent alarm bells off in any reader that the manuscript needed more attention because this error has no logical explanation. After finishing this book, I looked up the result of the case--a verdict was reached about six months after its publication--to see if the rush to publish had also colored the facts. It seems that the major mistake was in not taking enough time to ensure quality writing throughout."
4,Interesting Book...,"This is a very interesting book especially if you are a high school classmate of one of the accused. It is written very poorly...kinda like a weekly world news, but the facts that are presented are quite interesting and paint a fairly clear picture of the murders.Plus, in light of today's verdicts, the facts are correct!!!After you read this book, you will also want the murderers to burn."
4,Common problem in America - parents spoiling kids,"The author describes the two suspects well. He details their relationship and activities following the murders. A second book by Smith should follow. Didn't anyone see Joel's vehicle parked around the block, the day of the murders?We need to know the final judicial outcome. Also, I would like to know how this has affected the girlfriends of Dana and Joel. Did Dana or Joel ever learn what remorse is?Smith describes Dana as being overindulged with a Mercedes, etc. Since his mother had a ""career"", she supplied Dana with all kinds of money. It obviously was the wrong kind of attention any child needs. Although, Dana Ewell made the ultimate ""choice"" to do wrong."
4,Good collection of Regina's songs but needs a few more,"If many of you aren't familar with Regina Belle this is the collection to start with. Baby come to me {Not to be confused with Regina's other greatest hits collection is a great mini-collection of her best songs ranging from pop to soul and R&B.; From the Diane Warren ballad All I want is forever that was featured in the movie Taps then there is the dance hit Dream Lover that is a powerful dance tune. There is also This is love written by jazz singer Jonathan Butler that is a nice love ballad. There is also Regina's cover of Teddy pendergrass's hit love TKO and the Stylistics You are everything that are featured on her 1995 Reaching back album. The only drawback is with this collection Regina's first hits Show me the way and So many tears and make it like it was is not on hereGet it while you can and enjoy,Regis,P.S. This album has two different covers but it's the same thing"
2,an old cookbook,"I bought this book because a friend of mine had it and loaned it to me.Did not get around to using it right away and bought it because I felt that I needed to get the book back to him.After making a couple of the recipes, the second of which did not turn out well, I have decided that the book is dated. The recipes have such things as cheese (large amounts), honey, and bacon in them.Not a book for those of us that are looking to eat healthy."
1,NOT Dry roasted,The Amazon description says the soynuts are dry roasted. The packaging clearly indicates that they have been roasted in oil. I feel cheated: there is no way I would have placed the order had I known.
5,Heavy Duty Quality product,Looked at several drains at the big box stores and this one sure beats the other brands. Bought 4 and would do it again! The size in the title and body of description may not match. Go with the size listed in the body description (details).
2,Boring...............,"The probelm with this book is in the title. According to the title, it should be a historical account of the rulers of Roman Europe. Instead the book spends a great deal of time looking over what others wrote (particularly a Geoffrey of Monmouth) and whether or not what they say is true. It goes back and forth between bits of historical fact and whole sections of fiction. I guess if you are interested in every fictional piece of work ever written about the era (such as Arthur and Merlin), this is your kind of book. But if you really want to learn the history of such rulers as Constantine and Egbert, don't bother. You will be bored and disappointed."
5,The Great,"What can you say about Walter Payton? Of course the poster is nice, it's Walter Payton! The colors are vibrant and the poster is of great quality, just too small. Walter should be big and boldy displayed. Probably need to ored a MUCH larger poster."
3,"Eh......Not great, but still good","In this CD, I enjoyed the voice of the actress who portrayed Christine Daae, but the Phantom, well for that we need to talk about it. The actor who portrays the Phantom doesn't sing very well. He puts a lot of emotion into his singing but he's just not very good. If you want a good CD, than buy it. If you want a great one, then buy the original london cast version with Michael Crawford. Just my opinion."
2,Good but not good enough,"I expected more of this album. Wilkinson after all is one of the great Valjeans. On the good side, the music is update and thrillingly conducted. And Rebecca Caine makes a believable Christine whose fear of the Phantom is palpable. Her voice is stronger than Brightmans. But Wilkinson makes a Valjean pretending to be the Phantom. And his way of singing is wrong for the role. He also comes over as brutal and nasty, no wonder the girl was afraid. The sexual element that makes the Phantom so appealing and magnetic on the London cast is completely missing, and instead this is sadistic and cruel. I wouldn't have come to love the musical if this had been the original CD of it."
3,It's Still good!,I gave it three stars mostly cause it doesn't have all the songs.^^; I saw the Phantom with Mr.Wilkson in Canda as a young teen and it' still one of my favorite memories.
2,Butchered Phantom of the Opera,"Colm Wilkinson simply murdured ""Phantom"". That is what he did. His relatively nice tenor was completely destroyed, too, by his HIDEOUS overacting! Ridiculous!Rebecca Caine was a pretty-voiced Christine, although she didn't sound nearly young enough.Byron Neese was a fair Raoul, although not very sweet sounding.The orchestrations were good, the music was, well, Andrew Lloyd Webber, a masterpiece that speaks for itself. It would have been brilliant, if not for the awful leads. I strongly reccomend the Original Cast Recording before you go out and buy this."
4,Jean Val Jean is the Phantom!,"Colm Wilkinson (Jean Valjean in Les Miserables in the London, Broadway, and 10th Aniversery editions, Che in the concept album of Evita) dawns the white mask for this recording. And it's quite a treat. I feel Mr. Wilkinson combines the vocal discipline of Michael Crawford (the original) with the passion of Gerard Butler (the guy from the movie).As for the rest of the cast...they're o.k. I think anyone wanting to buy this should do it for Colm Wilkinson or maybe the production's Christine, Rebbeca Caine (who has a wonderful voice but also the common Christine disease of sounding way too old).If you'd like to hear a new take on a popular character I'd recommend this CD."
2,It could have been much better.,"The lyrics are more up to date than the Original Cast Recording, and Rebecca is quite good. Unfortunately, they picked one of the lesser Phantoms. Colm was trained in rock music, he doesn't get the angelic feel to him that Michael Crawford has. His rendition of Music of the Night is too stacatto-like. I would buy the Original London Recording, or save your money and buy every Les Miserables CD that you can afford that Colm is on. Michael Crawford IS the Phantom- Colm Wilkinson is Jean Valjean."
1,Wrong Choice,"To be honest, ALW made a mistake by casting Colm as the Phantom. He shouldn't have done because whenever I listen this album, I keep thinking that this is the sequel to Les Miserables and that the spirit of Valjean came to posess the Phantom! It's a good thing that I didn't buy this album but personally Colm is my no. 1 Valjean!"
2,Doesn't Measure Up,"Simply put, Michael Crawford is a god. Good old Colm can't measure up. Without even knowing the lyrics or the musical itself, you could tell the pain the Phantom was going through just through Crawford's voice. Colm sings with no or forced emotion, while Crawford's voice flows majestically and soulfully over the notes and the words.Sara Brightman's pure soprano is angelic, as opposed to the other Christine's vibrating train wreck.That and the words were changed for this CD...I'm sorry...this is a disappointment. Buy the original, people!"
5,Best recording,"The Phantom of the Opera has been performed by countless casts over the years. I attended performances in Canada, Syracuse, NY and most recently on Broadway. The Canadian recording remains to this day the premier choice."
3,You might want to listen to the clips before buying . . .,"I was looking for information on a particular cast recording of Phantom that happens to be an import and I accidentally stumbled on this one. Considering that I own most of the different cast recordings by different Lloyd Webber productions, when I read the other review for some reason I decided to listen to the samples. Just wanted to warn anyone there, this is the CANADIAN CAST RECORDING, not London - in other words, if you're a Michael Crawford phan, sorry, but I don't think this Phantom is for you. Now if you like the OLCR of Les Mis, you might like this one with Colm Wilkinson playing the Phantom. While he's not my favorite by any means, he is 'okay' (I like him much better as Valjean) Rebecca Caine's Christine is probably the saving grace of this production and Byron Neese's Raoul needs to take some lessons from both his predecessors and his succeeders."
5,The best sound of the phantom I have ever heard,"I have never had the privelige of seeing this preformance in person, but my mother is a very big fan and has several differnt versions. I love this one the best. Colm has THE right voice for the phantom. Low and soft but hard at just the right times. In the OLC Michel C. I think has too high of a voice. Unlike Michel and Sara, Colm and Rebecca compliment each other. Rebecca has the voice of an angle. I have nevr heard a voice like hers. If you are trying to decide which version to buy, may I sugest this one. You will greatly enjoy it just as I have"
3,"Depends on what you like, I guess...","I have just bought this version of Phantom and frankly, I'm a little disappointed. Personally, I feel that the Origional London Cast is much better then the Canadian one. The orchestrated parts are good, but I found the vocals were not up to scratch. Colm Wilkinson takes too many breathes while singing and Rebecca Cain seems to mature to play Christine. Michael Crawford in the London Cast is a much better Phantom. His voice; mysterious and powerful. He truly captures the feelings of Erick (The Phantom) and entrances the audience with his gorgeous voice. This album isn't trueley awful. If you're into lots of over-pronouncing, then this album is for you. If you want soft and emotional, go with the London cast."
3,Good cast recording..but..............,"I love the original London Cast recording, but this canadian version is a nice break when the original becomes redundant. I really like Rebecca Caine's performance as Christine. She has a beautiful, mature, more operatic voice. BUT, my biggest complaint is Colm Wilkinson!!!!!! What the heck happened to him? He gave an excellent performance in ""Les Miserables"" then he gives a terrible performance in Phantom! He.Sings.Like.This. And. It. Drives. Me. Crazy!!!!!!!!!!! I strongly feel that he was miscast in this role. If someone else had played it, I would give this 5 stars!!"
2,Not great... but okay.,"It's not a bad recording. Although, I find that there is alot of odd emphasis on certain words/phrases/etc. Some parts are too slow, others are too fast. Also, Colm Wilkinson is not a very good Phantom. Actually, he is often very difficult to listen to. However, he's rather good during The Music of the Night. Anyway, I would recommend instead The Original London Cast, or Das Phantom der Oper (original German recording)."
5,Star Shining Bright,".""No Will Power"" is a gem of an album. This album is a great introduction to this wonderful talent from LA that I've had the chance to see live. The production qulaity is first rate. She has a unique style all her own that stands up well alongside artists like Michelle Branch, Natalie Merchant and 70's Linda Ronstadt."
4,Getting There,I listened to Kat's Cd while I was working at her college booking agency and I fell in love with her sound. I usually prefer male artists but Kat's music was such a pleasant surprise! She's definitely on to something here! It's only a matter of time before she is completely well known!
1,Needs work,"I was given this CD as a gift. Although her voice is pleasing at times, the songs basically are amateurish and not memorable. With some help, she has potential but for now I give it a thumbs down.Jon"
1,"Poor construction, won't last long","I use earbuds a lot, and I bought 3 pairs. They worked fine, but each of mine broke by wires pulling out of the volume adjustment. It's true that I am very active with them (biking, working on home repairs while I listen), but the volume control is the weak point as far as durability goes, and they broke sooner than others I've tried."
2,ugh,"I just don't like the huge ear plugs that are on this set. Even though they have volume control, it is horrible. If you are going to spend little on a pair, there is a similar product from the same company with earbuds...the volume control is much better and I never had to put it all the way up.To me, they aren't even worth it if they are a penny with free shipping. I gave them away."
2,low quality earphones,"very bad to use on an airplane because the earphones just aren't loud enough to block out the background noise on a plane, which was the intent of its purchase (other earphones plugged into the same computer jack in the same situation provide louder, crisper sound). The earphones also are scratchy and create static when they are plugged in. The carrying-case winding mechanism doesn't work very well either. I have a pair of Sony earphones which work way better and will definitely use them in any situation that i can instead of these.This was a poor choice and i wish i could return these earphones."
1,the cable is missing a pin,"the cable has a manufacturing flaw. I purchased two and there was a pin missing in both of them. I called company and they said "" they are all like that"". The price was right as was the shipping charges so I kept the cable. But if you need all the pins don't buy this item."
3,Get the original version by Willcox only,"This is an updated, expanded version of the classic political history originally authored solely by William Willcox. Though more comprehensive and improved, the original stands better as a concise, well-written account of the period. Numerous language changes, presumably to make the book more appealing to college-age textbook readers abound. For example: ""Thus Frederick was saved from the ring of his enemies and saw the chance to triumph over Austria, while Spain and France were surfeited with defeats."" is changed in the updated version to the ungainly: ""Thus in Europe Frederick was saved from the ring of his enemies and won a chance to triumph over Austria, while overseas the Bourbon powers suffered one defeat after another."" Get the original and save yourself 100 or so pages, unless you have to read it for college, in which case you'll need the one authored by both Willcox and Arnstein."
1,It would be nice if they got the dates right!,"The book is a helpful, weekly calendar, but there are a few flaws and some major ones. Saturday and Sunday are grouped together as a weekend, so use as a weekend planner is not as easy. However, the fatal flaw are the dates that are wrong. I actually had to go through and fix all of 2004 (there are two places where days are skipped)! Great idea, bad implementation, horrible editing!"
2,Disappointed,"I thought that this was more than it is. By reading the review and description, I thought there would be added advice, teaching ideas, great help for the student. But, they already have a planner at school. And that is all this book is. A planner. There is no other use for this book. It's just a calendar."
3,Great for a new Believer,This Bible is an easy read for someone who just come to a relationship with the Lord. It is a good read in present day language. A person can get on the way to a life relationship full of His Glory.
5,Great gift,"What a Year It Was! makes a terrific gift for someone reaching a milestone birthday. I have received this as a gift for my ""50th"", and have since given it to others reaching their milestone birthday."
5,awesome!,"best book/breakdown/view of the ruy Lopez that I've ever read.... anywhere! well worth the price, but buy it used, cause the new ones r HIGH price.... came with some water stains around the edges n minor yellowing like any used book would have, but the contents r truly eye opening...."
2,Poor Quality,"I picked the brand with the hard soles because I wanted to wear them outside. The soles are very, very thin and unless you just plan on going to the mailbox they will not be comfortable. The leather is flimsy also. I will use them for houseshoes."
5,SHOES,THIS SHOES ARE VERY VERY COMFITABLE. LOOKS GREAT WITH A PAIR JEANS OR WHAT EVER YOU DECIDE TO HOOK THEM UP WITH. I RECOMMEND THEM.
2,Not up to Minnetonka par,"I love Minnetonka shoes and have worn them for several years. These boots are cute, but the quality is not up to par with the other shoes I have previously owned that were made by Minnetonka. The right shoe has a wretchedly hard knot right on the insole at the rise of my arch. It rubs and is like walking with a pebble in my shoe. I fear if I cut it the entire sole will unravel from the upper. It is going to cost me an additional fifteen dollars to take it to my local cobbler for repair. I should not have to repair brand new shoes. Quallity control needs to pay closer attention."
2,Interesting but....,There are somethings I do not agree with. I strongly urge anyone who reads this to read it back to back with the bible and not just take the book as truth for you...
1,No Sense!,"I started the book because I really liked Defcon One. I only read about 50 pages and quit because the plot didn't make any sense. How could anyone hijack a B2 at gunpoint, threatening to kill the pilots and blow up the aircraft if they don't fly it to Cuba. I'm sure that the pilots (if they were any kind of Americans) would have rather died and lost the aircraft then to turn it over to the Russians. Especially since they mention that they were all going to die anyway when trying to talk the defector out of it.A true patriot would have gone down with the ship!"
1,"It does not have 100% coverage, TRUST ME!!!","If you go to any books store, you can find a lot of books on A+ from different publishers. However, if you want to get a higher score and get a full understanding on the hardwares and operating systems, this is not the book that can help you! A lot of the materials from my exam did not appear in anywhere on this book (especially the Operating System exam)!! Throughout my study on A+, I found this book is not relevant to the questions from both of the A+ exam."
3,"Good on hardware, poor on OS, NO SUPPORT","The hardware part of this book was great. I passed the exam with flying colours on this part. However the second part, on OSes, is largely insufficient. I got 4 or five questions in the exam (out of 30!) that clearly had never been covered in the book. The software on the accompanying CD is buggy and useless. The so-called adaptive exam is not adaptive at all and does not teach you anything about what the real thing will be like. Syngress has simply not answered my mail asking for a new version of the software. Some mistakes in the text are also unacceptable (like the Pentium II only going up to 333 MHz when it really went to 450)."
1,Far from the best choice.,"There are much better texts available. This may be a good starting point, but it most likely won't get you a passing score on the exams by itself. The book and testing software are missing many key points, and are full of errors. Syngress has chosen to completely avoid supporting this title, and I for one will not purchase another Syngress title because of this blatant lack of concern for their customers.The All-in-One A+ Certification Exam Guide 3rd Edition by Michael Myers, would be a much better all in one choice."
1,"Ok on Hardware, absolute garbage on the OS portion","After reading the Hardware portion of this book and completing the practice exams for the Hardware test, I passed, although not by a wide margin. After reading the OS portion of this book twice, completing the practice exams, and EVEN MAKING NOTECARDS OF THE ENTIRE OPERATING SYSTEMS SECTION, I failed the OS test. One hundred bucks down the tube, thanks Syngress, I wish I would have read this review page before buying the book. I do not understand why this book has such poor coverage, it has the CompTIA approval logo on it. Ah lessons learned."
5,A well-written guide for A+ prep,"I got this book on the recommendation of a friend, and I'm glad I did. It's well written and easy to read. It covered the information I needed to pass and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to know what to focus on for the A+ test."
1,Pitiful - Please read before buying this book,"Whoever got paid for editing this book should be ashamed. I have never returned a book - until now. I returned both the soft cover and this text book. The number of errors was disgusting, considering those with no prior computer background are counting on this book to give them the information they need to pass the test! The text was bad enough, but the soft cover had answers that conflicted with the text's same questions, and the text's free software to help you test yourself was also full of mistakes. Pass this one by - try the Sybex A+ Complete. I received a score of over 90% using only this book. Good luck."
4,translation is schwer,"Hoffman ranges from brilliant to atrocious in his translation work that I've read, but the poems are consistently fantastic in German. Translating poems is nearly as difficult as writing them, and Hoffman's efforts are valiant enough to forgive a lot. Grünbein's poetry is a present sent from Germany with love."
2,Dockers has inferior buttons,The last six Dockers products I purchased all had buttons that broke up after a few washings. No problem with the replacement buttons I had to sew on. I'm a guy who is pissed to have to do this.
4,Works Great! The Blue Gel Is....,These Gel caps work great! But the Blue Gel is whiter than I expected. The rest of them are just fine!
4,Used as Christmas lights,We have spot lights around our house and I put these caps on them to color up the outdoors a bit and light my trees in various colors. Works well. We like them.
3,Not Horrible,"Package arrived a lot quicker than the tracking email said.""Only"" shortcoming is, the blue lens barely looks blue. Just barely"
1,Company is horrible!,They are Terrible! Their customer service stinks! The other part that went with this didn't work and the company never replaced it or gave me my money back.
5,Extremely CUTE!,"I got a little sister who is 3, who absolutely loves this movie. It has some singing, and the plot is very nice. It has a little touch of romance but a most of all a great adventure plot. I would recomend this to ages 2-7. It is a great car movie because it really keeps you going. So splurge and get this movie, you will not regret it ;-) !!"
1,Don't waist you money!!!,"This movie is nothing like the real movie, the seven dwarfs are seven old guys... so weird..."
3,It's a good for beginner,"I was a foreign sutuendt in America. This book is my textbook for English class. When I read this book first, the contents are not difficut for me, and a lot of examples are very useful and clear. The exercises are a little bit difficult for me, but after I finished the exercises, my grammar knowledge improved."
3,Better as a reference than as a textbook,"From a teacher's perspective, this book works well as a resource or reference. It is particularly helpful in addressing issues of academic English. Unlike a lot of other textbooks that deal with writing, this one has a clear ESL focus on grammar forms that give university level students problems in academic writing. However, while it is an excellent source of information, it is lacking in exercises. Using it as the sole textbook for a university ESL writing course has forced me to devote a great deal of energy to supplementing the detailed grammar explanations with exercises of my own. At times, it also serves to confuse students more than enlighten them as a result of its explanation intensive approach to grammar instruction. Even the teacher's guide and workbook lack adequate explanations, answers or supplementary activities."
3,"Black and white, but got much contents","As usual grammar learning books, it covers everything about English grammar. It's well organized because it tells us from basic grammar to advanced grammar step by step. Each chapter has appropriate amount of example sentenses at the end of it. And they are good to know how to use English words, e.g. articles, conjunctions, adverbs, and idioms in which way it is easy to learn I think. In Appendix, it got useful explanation of vocabulary, idioms, and so on. But, I think it is uncomfortable to read because it is printed in black and white and doesn't have blank lines and spaces very much and it doesn't use any pictures and many tables to explain; however, it means it got lots of contents."
3,As common as it gets.,"This book has both merits and demerits. It has some strong points. It gives lots of information related to grammar. It also has many useful examples that can be happened in real situations. One of the weakest points is that it is too hard to catch the main point at a glance. Another, it doesn't have no pictures, and most of all, the design of the text is not clear, that is, it is difficult to follow how it explains the contents."
3,We need more details of grammar for easy writing.,"I am using this book as my textbook for English composition class. It is fairly a good book as a texbook, but I think I need more grammar lessons with more detailes. Because this book usually shows some brief examples for a certain expression, we need more explanations for specific grammar. We also need clear definitions for the grammatical terms and guide for exercises."
5,Excellent survey of major philosophers,"Richard Double provides a clear, accessible, and easy to understand survey of many of the most famous philosophers. I am a novice in this area, but after reading this text, I have a better grasp of the major concepts, terms and ideas. I am impressed to such an extent that I bought copies as gifts for relatives. Double demonstrates the logic, reasoning and theory of a wide range of philosophers,and touches on the relationship between philosophy and science, but ignores philosophies which birthed in other disciplines (eg. positivism). He thoroughly explores philosophies of (western) religion, reflecting his earlier interests in free-will and the existence of God. The glossary and quotes are functional and useful.--Joseph Atkinson, Librarian, Los Angeles Public Library Social Sciences, Philosophy & Religion Dept."
5,My misery ended with this supplement.,"Before I've taken this supplement I used to have excruciating cramps, heavy blood clots, heavy bleeding, could not eat anything for the first two days..not even a sip of water! This supplement have saved me much misery with hardly any cramps, tiny to no blood clots, less bleeding and could eat dairy, meats and some fattening foods and was still ok (though I recommend not to). I love this product and will stack up.If anybody is suffering please give it a try because you will not go wrong and no prescription medication couldn't take away the horrific pain."
3,Worth it for mild cramps,"This cramp bark tincture works pretty well for mild cramping. It couldn't alleviate my more severe cramps, however, and I had to turn to OTC pain relievers."
2,Not effective on severe cramps,"When I bought this last month and used in on the 2nd day of my period, it didn't do anything. Today I woke up super early with severe cramps, as I usually have the first day of my period. And again taking this (40 drops dissolved in water) didn't help. About 10 minutes later I took another 40 drops dissolved in water and still nothing. I will update this once I get an ultrasound to see if I have fibroids (because that might affect the answer), but for now, not effective.I've read that the extract of Viburnum (which this product is) is a great anti-spasmodic, but I think more so for other muscle cramps elsewhere in the body. Wasn't impressed for using it for menstrual cramps bottom line.UPDATE 12/2012: Yes it was confirmed that i had two minor fibroid tissues, so to whomever's purchasing who has fibroids, don't waste your money until you get the fibroid situation figured out w/ a doctor/naturopath."
1,Not a music education resource,"While this book may be useful to general educators, music educators beware. This book has no lesson plans that promote the acquisition of musical skills."
1,Music,Kids did not know most of music and I did not know most of music and movements were lost to me.
5,Excellent value,This book and the accompanying CD's provide many opportunities for fun in the early childhood classroom. I would recommend this book for anyone planningKindergarten classroom activities.
4,Bad movie but very good soundtrack from Jon Lord and crew,The movie is nearly unwatchable and a real shame since this soundtrack is without doubt one of the better western/rock crossover attempts. To be fair- its less rock and more a mix of off kilter funky jazz- progressive rock and orchestral pieces with a few choice vocal cuts- written by the team of Jon Lord of Deep purple fame and Tony Ashton along with dyke. I bought this on a whim after hearing a track on youtube and glad i did- its almost unclassifiable at times and would stand on its on as a regular album- the bonus cuts are plenty- maybe too much of a good thing which makes the cd drag with alternate takes but from a historical view this a real time capsule project that works - a few songs even have shades of almost David Axelrod genius- pick this up before it becomes a pricety rarity- ps great liner notes and sound is very good.
2,Not so hot,This scale does not zero out and jumps all over the place. If you want accuracy this is not the scale. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Worked nicely...,...for about 10 days and then mysteriously stopped. Tried to get an exchange but the seller (not Amazon) can only give my money back. Avoid the hassle and go with a different brand.
5,Handy and Easy,"I really like this model. When not in use, the bowl turns upside down and pretty much encases the unit. You can go back and forth from grams to ounces with the push of a button."
1,Not worth the money,"Not easy to read, you can not tell if it is on grams or ounces without getting a flashlight to look at it. The numbers were hard to see. The picture of it shows the window and makes it look easy to read and see. I am a baker and was weighing various ingredients and it shut off several times while I was adding to it. Yes I changed the battery. Look for a different brand and you get what you pay for."
3,It works but it's a little persnickety...,"I really can't entirely complain about this item since it ultimately does what it's supposed to do but with an item that has so few functions that need to work properly I was a little dissapointed that the tare/zero button seemed to be rather fickle. It takes about six or seven presses of the button for me to get it to actually zero out otherwise it generally skates above zero enough to throw off my readings. This probably won't matter for most casual kitchen use but I use this to weigh out brewing ingredients and for the sake of consistancy in my homebrewing getting the correct weights is something that I value.In summary, it's a decent scale and the price was right. Perhaps I'm a little spoiled since I work in a lab and have some really fantastic scales. This model should work for most people's everday use but it isn't the best solution for the hobbiest needing precise measurements."
1,Read this before you buy.,"The display window is too small for the display. The window cuts off part of ""Tare"" on the left, and ""G"" / ""Oz"" on the right. The window is also smaller than the height of the digits and cuts off the top and bottom of the digits. You have to position your head at just the right angle to read the display, then when you put the (supplied) bowl on the scale, you find you are looking through the plastic bowl to read the scale. It is not as pictured. I've designed electronic equipment for 40 years, and this is amazingly bad.The curved window also reflects a lot of room light, and the display contrast is poor. You can read the scale, but I found it frustrating. I gave it away and bought an Ultraship for only $12 more."
1,Piece of garbage.,The display is unreadable. It's almost impossible to tell if you're measuring grams or ounces. And when you're weighing pounds and ounces this scale only displays ounces. Not pounds and ounces. 1lb. 8oz. reads as 24oz. The bowl doesn't even fit the scale when flipped upside down. Very cheap.
4,Not bad,"Cobalt Blade has good power, but not much in any other stat field. It's worth it to get the Cobalt Power Wing, which improves your power dramatically."
5,awesome product,this is great for people who love this stuff. i would recommend buying more b-daballs for this product and another b-daman
4,Not your father's star trek!,"I must say I love Pocket Books new daring take on the Star Trek franchise. The New Earth series, Millenium, Gemworld, Dark Matters, and now the latest the Mirror Universe duology Dark Passions. This book is filled with many of beloved characters, but with a charming dark twist. Politics is the game of the day and the characters shine with all the double dealing going on behind the scenes. Intendant Kira shines as much in the novel as she did when Nana Visitor brought her to life on Deep Space Nine. The story telling is tight, the characters believable, and my only complaint is that these two books should have been one novel, much like the SwordHunt duology should have been. Looking forward to book two!"
2,Bleh,"I had such hope for this two-book novel, if for nothing else than the delicious cover art. Unfortunately, it fell short of the mark. The cover art was pretty much the best thing. Now, I *know* the story was about characters from the Mirror Universe, most of whom we hadn't ever met before, aside from Intendant Kira and Regent Worf, but I still could not get my head around the characters as written. This is not necessarily Susan Wright's fault. She is limited, like all the pro-novelists are, by canon. Some things just *cannot happen,* even in the Mirror Universe.But still, the thing that disappointed me the most (and I guess this *is* Susan Wright's fault), the novel ultimately turned out NOT to be about ""the strong women of the Mirror Universe,"" but was instead a thinly veiled story about Our Girl Not A Borg In This Universe But Still A Mighty Well-Stacked Terran Raised By Cardassians Member Of The Obsidian Order Seven-of-Nine. Sigh...even in the Mirror Universe, she gets top billing."
5,Worth getting,"This book is part one of two. Very interesting, especially with Troi as a main character. Makes you want to buy the second book to see how the story ends."
5,One of the best.,this book is one of the best depictions of the mirror universe ive seen... it caugth me in the first few pages i read it (both volumes) in 3 days...It would be hard to do better.
2,"poor quality tape, not seller's fault","The quality of this VHS tape is so bad, it must be at least a 5th generation copy. The seller shipped it promptly, and the outward quality was as seller described. Just almost impossible to watch."
5,Court drama extraordinaire . . .,"A woman, desperate to have a child, resorts to artificial insemination without the knowledge of her sterile but it-could-not-possibly-be-my-fault husband and sets off a string of events that changes her life forever."
1,Horrible quality,These are completely different from the ones I previously ordered and they don't even look like the ones in the photo or the original game.
5,bouncing balls,The balls were used as a replacement for those I lost to a Cariboo Game I own. They fit the size necessary for the opening for the prize and my grandson is happy again.
4,Cariboo Replacement Balls,"These balls work perfectly for replacing any lost balls from the Cranium game Cariboo.I am so glad I found them. Our dog ate a ball, and the game doesn't work without 6 balls. Now we have extra in case it happens again!The balls came very quick and work great. Perfect size.Thank you"
3,LA VERITE,"The album is fair but quite inferior to 'Night people''.The vocals are a bit excessive sometimes, overexagerated.It fails to reproduce the atmosphere of ''Night people.''"
3,Basic book for wanna-be retirees,"This book covers the most fundamental questions that people thinking of retiring or just retired may want to know, such as where to relocate, cost of health care, new job opportunities, scams to avoid, etc.It is written in plain, accessible language and uses large fonts (a nice touch!). It also relies heavily on listing websites that can be useful: this feature, while welcome by most, may however be a nuisance for the elderly who are not so familiar with ""surfing the net""."
1,Didn't like at all.,"I threw mine away after couple months of not using. I didn't really like the texture of this brand. Instead, I use IDEAL brand which comes in powder form and granule forms."
3,Xmas is All Around you,We recently saw the movie and felt that Billy Mack did a fabulous job singing this song. We enjoyed it completely.
4,You'll Desire This Dude,"Wonderfully erotic. Some reviewers have objected to the fact that anti-hero Justin has such an intense hatred of the heroine, but wants a sexual relationship with her anyway. Frankly, I think his ongoing dislike of her is what keeps the sexual suspense alive. He doesn't make it easy for his widowed stepmother to win him over - but he sure does make it fun. Excellent side characters, atmospheric place descriptions, and an unexpected climax. (Well, at least one of the climaxes is unexpected.) Thea Devine gets better and better."
2,Repetitious Plot,"This was the first book by this author that I have read. I am not likely to read another. There were very erotic sex scenes, although the characters didn't really seem to connect emotionally. None of the characters seemed well developed and the story dragged and repeated itself a number of times.Perhaps books in this branch of the romance genre focus more on the erotic images rather than on a well written plot and interesting characters."
4,Hotter than Florida in August!,"In catching up on my reading, I discovered this older Thea Devine title, Desire Only Me, near the bottom of the pile. Since Ms. Devine's books tend to be great summer reading, I pulled it to the top and off to the beach we went. Well, steamy isn't a strong enough word for the relationship between Justin and Diandra. The immediate emnity between them sets the stage for Devine fireworks in the bedroom and out. A few plot twists, well developed secondary characters - Ms. Devine has herself a winner.Would I buy this book? Yes. Would I keep it? YES."
1,Someone stop me from buying another Thea Devine book,"I really like erotic romance novels - but this one was a total waste. It's not even good junk reading. I found myself just flipping through it to get to the sex and that wasn't good either. The story was way wierd, strange, ridiculous whatever. Then the ending -- how could two people fall in love after all of that nonsense with the grey ghost, divining board, planchette, etc? I didn't like it at all. I would have to be hard pressed to buy another one of Devine's books. She won't be getting another cent from me until her stories improve."
5,Reads like fiction,"AWOL, a non-fiction novel by Jack Hand, has all the action and drama of a Best Seller. Incident after incident we are led through crazy schemes, astonishing punishments, and an unbelievable ending. AWOL reads like fiction as Mr. Hand offers us glimpses into the ugliness of war. This well written tale will keep you entertained, page after page.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge."
4,"Good, Not Great","Fits well enough in my 1997 Lexus LX450 rear window (passenger side) - does not stand upright though, a little droopy, so although it works well enough for a water bottle, I'd get a little nervous putting a large top-heavy drink. It's inexpensive and better than no cup holder for passengers."
1,subtitle,"This Japanese DVD came without subtitle. It may be a great film, I can't appreciate it. what a waste of money."
1,artsy with thin plot,"The blurb about this film leads you to believe it is a comedy. It records snippets of experiences by various members of a rural japanese family but has very sketchy plot development. it is artsy, so if you want to see an artsy japanese film with a beautiful country setting and not much story, then this is it. but this is not a traditional comedy, don't expect to laugh out loud. i just want to alert a prospective buyer on what to expect."
4,I think this system is great... just needs games.,"I didnt purchase a bundle system, but I did get a PS2 and love it!!! The system is way more powerful then Dreamcast which I also have. The Dreamcast does have a better software lineup then the PS2 right now, but by this summer into the fall expect to see some great games. In the lines of competition (XBOX) (GAMECUBE) I will get them both, but Nintendo is concentrating on the younger crowd again, and who knows what the XBOX holds... personally I dont trust ..., but I will get it anyway. The PS2 will ... now, but byde your time my friends this summer is a PS2 summer!!.. Dont worry about Nintendo or Microsoft.. The PS2 will keep up with them."
5,Great Blazer,Well constructed blazer. Great color. You can wear with jeans or shirt and tie for church.
4,Hype Golden Clutch,"Another high-quality product from Amazon at a GREAT price. Even the lining in this bag is cute! It fits a cell phone (not a PDA), keys, money, cards, and a lip gloss comfortably, but not much else, too tiny for me but the quality/style/price is still fantastic. I do wear this on the weekends when I only need my keychain-wallet, cellphone, and gloss."
1,"Morphine, please","I feel for the author's pain. This is very difficult to read without feeling it. It is a dreadful thing to do to attempt to tear to shreds the likes of the late Andrew Wyeth. On some level, I suspect this author admires him very much."
1,THIS BOOK IS PURE NONSENSE! Become an artist before you become a critic.,"Amazing how a fellow who never held a paint brush in his hand can review artists.He looks down on Wyeth, but I dare him to paint one moment of truth. Build up a lifetime of painting and drawing before you break people down into your little boxes. You have no idea what it is to spend ones life, studying, painting, trying to capture a play in light, a form, a gesture, a feeling within a soul. You are the angry little boy that wish he could."
3,Nice book but nothing new..... (;<),"I am a fourth time L1 recertifacation tech and I always try to get a study guide and read over the four and five gas part very heavy since I don't live in an area that requires IM240 testing. I already owned the previous version three and was afraid not to upgrade to version four. However, I wasted my money on the upgrade. There is no new information in the new book. Both books are supurbly written and if you don't have either of the books then by all means, get the newest copy. However, if you own version three, don't waste the money on version four. Good luck on the test!!!"
5,Big Trouble in Little China x Unauthorized Brady Bunch Bio,"Marty has gone from one occupational extreme to the other - from child star to burned out detective.His first appearance, Celestial Dogs, is set in LA as the skeptical Marty is caught in the crossfire between clans of ancient Eastern demons. Marty battles the worst of human and inhuman natures - deranged producers, rent collectors, evil turtle demons, and his own nostalgia for his wild childhood days. Like a cross between 'Big Trouble in Little China' and an unauthorized biography of the 'Brady Bunch', this is a hilarious, unconventional book that defies easy description.Russell also writes some good splatterpunk, and even in the Marty Burns series, the feel is less 'noir' and more 'bitter and messy'. They're good fun - visceral, cinematic and surprisingly clever."
1,Financial Market DVD,"Was not impressed with this DVD. Was not detailed enough in the areas of investment. Boring to follow, extremely basic. Tossed it...."
3,Same Info For Free Online,You can find this same info online for free so why pay $25? Save your money and do a search on youtube or browse investopedia.
3,Gotta love Stanley,"You have to love Stanley for his inimitable style and personality. I read a lot of theology (Moltmann, Brueggeman, etc.) and found this book confusing and contradictory at times. It certainly is not the easy read that Resident Aliens is. Hauerwas is long on analysis and short on prescribing any solution on how Christians are to live or what they are to do in a post-Christian culture. The new introduction has him apologizing at length for this. But it would have been better to add a chapter which helps us to set a new course."
5,Great Show and Great FREE TICKET surprise!!,I pre-ordered this one a few months ago and it arrived just last week along with the new documentary dvd.When I finally opened TAoS season 3&4 I was surpised to find a FREE MOVIE TICKET for Superman Returns inside!!!What a great gift!!What a great movie too!!
5,AS GOOD AS IT GETS FOR TV FANS,"THE 3RD AND 4TH SEASONS IN COLOR ARE PROBABLY AS GOOD AS IT COULD GET FOR AN AVID VIEWER OF GEORGE REEVES SUPERMAN. I NEVER KNEW THEY WERE IN COLOR TILL 1960 WHEN WE BOUGHT OUR 1ST BIG SCREEN (19"")COLOR TV. AS GREAT AS IT WAS IN B&W, THE COLOR SEEMED TO MAKE THE ACTION ONLY TRUER AND ENHANSTED VIEWING PLEASURE. TO SEE HIS COSTUME, PERRY WHITE'S CHECKERED SPORTS JACKET, JIMMY'S RED HAIR; DC COMICS CAME TO LIFE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANY OR PURCHASE OF ALL IN THIS SERIES. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.!!!"
3,Reviews BEFORE Release?????,"Why are people submitting ""reviews"" BEFORE THE DVD IS RELEASED???A Better question - why does Amazon allow them to do do so.I prefer to read reviews by people that have actually seen the product."
5,Classic TV,"Classic tv at its best, even though seasons 3 & 4 are colorized I still am a long term fan all my life of Superman and almost everything associated with this epic icon. Packaging isn't that phenomonal given this is Superman ( could've been great with all the production in boxed sets and extras and packaging and the fact Superman is the largest superhero on Earth for fans/reconized you'd think marketing would have thought that through before releasing a cheap card board sheath with this...I was hoping for a tin lunch boxed set in a perfect world ) but; I really love the George Reeves take on the original tv Superman so I own all available seasons. This to me is a must have for not just fans but for classic tv viewers and tv historians. Enjoyable for EVERYONE. This was filmed in color to begin with but was also released in color UNLIKE seasons 1 & 2 which were released in BLACK and WHITE which I prefer. 5 stars"
4,Great To See Superman In Color,"Many have never seen Superman in color, especially if they only saw them in the fifties. The color quality is excellent. WB should have cleaned up the opening titles better, but overall the experience is quite satisfying."
3,I Liked It,"I loved the colour series,overall very good, in some scenes the quality is average, hey but its 1950's tv and we are lucky to have it in colour, i think you guys had colour from 1964 and 1974 for Australia, so some foresight from the producers in the fifties to make the series very popular in syndication."
4,I love Superman,"This set of disks is great and the only disappointment I had was the opening creditsFor all the work to clean up the episodes it seems to me they could have digitized a cleanversion of the opening of each show. Instead the same OLD one is used for each episodewith cracks, scratches and pops. It's a small detail but when you see it over and over...Well you get my meaning.I give it 4 stars for that reason.Hats off to the rest of it.Its first rate."
4,Superman TV Episodes,"People old enough to remember George Reeves as Superman in the 1950s and 1960s will enjoy seeing these Superman shows once again. Although the story lines seem childish to an adult, the shows survive as happy memories from our younger days, as Lois Lane, Jimmy Olson and others are rescued in the nick of time by Superman, with the bad guys' bullets bouncing off his chest. The extra features that are included are noteworthy, with modern-day interviews of Lois (Noel Neill) and Jimmy (Jack Larson), and explanations of the show's special effects. Go ahead and buy it -- for fun!"
3,Superman in Color #1,"It was great to see these episodes again, but I guess I expected morefrom WB. On many episodes, the color is washed out, at least for part ofthe episode. Also, I realize that old films are not perfect, and lightflashes sometimes occur, but I though WB had the original films. Many ofthese episodes have serious running flaws, where the film obviouslydidn't run right. Didn't anyboby verify that the film-to-DVD transfer wasokay before trying to sell the item? Some of these episodes are worse thanthe TV reruns, and WB is supposed to be working from the masters!!"
5,Superman is just super,"This is just a fun series to watch. It from a simpler time when bad guys were bad and the good guy was Superman. To those of us who grew up in the 50's and 60's George Reeves was Superman not the ones who came later. This is a chance to have your childhood reborn. How can the most powerful being on Earth ever lose? There is is suspense in these episodes. The earlier volumes are also great, but now watch the man of steel in color."
2,THE EMPEROR MOST HIGH!,"Who would've thought that the Emperor would turn out to be the most dynamic and interesting character in the Unleashed line?! The billowing, cloud-like cloak, and oustandingly realistic branched energy bolts really put this sculpt over the top! The mounting base-done up in a metallic turquoise-complements the figure beautifully. Get one right away!"
4,An amazing story,"This book contains an amazing story. You have to be willing to wade through a little family history to get to the meat, but once you do, it is an engaging and amazing story. My kids' book club loved it too, and we were honored with a visit by the author herself!"
4,lost album really shines.,"i read about bobby jameson in an article in mojo magazine and decided to check this out. it's an excellent album that sometimes reminds me alot of love, especially on songs like ""girl from vernon mountain"". both jameson and love were from los angeles but jameson claims to have preceded love, so you have to wonder who influenced who. some of the more folky sounding songs kind of have a bluesy feel, ala fred neil. songs like ""there's a war going on"" and ""world war 3"" are quintessential folk protest songs; with heavy strumming and intense and paranoid vocal delivery. good recording quality, good songs... not quite a lost classic but interesting music and an insightful look at some of the deep roots of rock and roll."
5,Excellent read.,I could not stop reading this book. The amount of things we have in common was unnerving. The things he holds important in life hit a nerve with me. I only wish that I had the same guts he had to follow his inner voice.
3,You got to love fly fishing to love this book...,"While I agree with the author's sentiments whole-heartedly regarding the beauty of the wilderness, conservation of the land for the next generation, and the history presented, I cannot get into the fly fishing aspect of the book which is central to the theme and information presented in the book. Knowing fly fishing makes this book sing a song like a brook, that is welcome to one's ears, be a wilderness experience, a complexity that is a feast for the senses, and a awesome beauty that paints pictures that are a delight as if one is out on the river flyfishing."
5,At the River's Edge,"Great read. Having passionately fly fished for 53 years, I can definitely relate to Jerry's thoughts while he is standing in the middle of a western river.""Bo"" Cash, Morganton, NC"
4,Good leash with a dog that is succeeding in intermediate dog training classes.,We've used this slip lead several times and I like that it is soft yet strong. My dog and I are in dog training classes and this leash was recommended by others in the class.
4,"Dog likes it, wish it was longer","I bought this for my puppy since I didn't want to use a collar with him at first. It works great, my only complaint is that it's only 6'. Sometimes when he goes to the bathroom I have to follow him around on the grass since it's kind of short. 8-12' would be more ideal. The quality and everything else about it is very nice."
3,Mistakes --> Discovery,"I recently purchased a Mendota braided slip lead for a kennel I volunteer at. I accidentally left the lead hanging on the fence for a week and it shrunk to about 3.5'-4'. I have only myself to blame for this. But hey, now I know not to leave these things outside."
3,I liked it but not as much as my dog.,Chewed right through it first day. I have a rescue lab. His previous owners should have been beaten with this leash. He had and still has a long way to go. Not your average pooch when it comes to obedience. 8 months of neglect and mistreatment is a hard long road. Snapping the lead dog whisperer type method was useless. He just didn't listen. period. I didn't like the choker chains cause he would pull regardless. Though this would be better on his neck. Turns out a harness worked much better. When he pulls it just turns him around. Who would-a thought? I sewed this up where he chewed through it 2X and I use it when he’s tied up hanging out with me in the front yard. Might be better on a well adjusted animal. Not my pooch. Other than that soft light easy to roll-up and put in your pocket. Mine got shorter and shorter LOL..
5,Best leads ever!,Love this slip lead. Sturdy and also for great control of the dog. For a heavy puller this made a difference in our walks. Plus I don't keep collars on my dogs since they are indoor and only go outside with me so this is a great quick leash to grab.
3,it is okay,i like the quality of the leash but i don't think it works as well as a training tool as i had hoped.
3,Groping for literature...,"This book tries hard to be literary and just misses. It starts very slowly -- the very beginning, in which Elias builds a homestead in the deep woods, is interesting, but then it gets slow with the exception of one scene of really disturbing violence. Eventually, the Civil War starts, and while those scenes aren't badly done, I was put off by the fact that Elias' big action scene is stolen straight out of the life of Nathan Bedford Forrest. The writing here is decent, and it certainly isn't a *bad* book, but there are so many others out there that are better that it probably isn't worth seeking out."
1,Good then poor,"This was an excellent item...for about 3 uses...then the mandoline would not hold to one thickness...it keeps opening up to maximum cut depth. MIU France says this is not their problem...""just buy a new one"". With an attitude like that...and product failure so quickly.....yes, I will buy a different brand...and avoid MIU France products"
1,Not The Best Choice,"I had high hopes for this mandoline, but I unfortunately have had to return it and, for the first time, I feel a certain responsibility to write a review. The blades of this mandoline are dull, dull, dull. When it arrived, I first tried slicing an onion, which actually was somewhat successful, although the slices were torn and uneven. The carrot I then tried was more shredded than sliced. Forget tomatoes -- do not try tomatoes, period! Unless you want tomato juice and there are easier ways to get tomato juice. This mandoline will definitely slice potatoes and cucumbers although the slices tend to be uneven, but perhaps I wasn't applying even pressure. However, I haven't had this problem with my V slicer which, I guess, for now, I'll continue to use. My advice would be, don't buy this one."
3,Problems with the safety handle,This mandoline worked well for few weeks and then the metal needles broke off on the safety handle. Now I can't attach any vegetables to it.After three month of moderate use the mandoline still works but without the safety handle.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this mandoline from another merchant and have been unsatisfied with it. I've been searching for a replacement off and on ever since and finally looked at what Amazon has to offer. I saw the mandoline I already owned and read the reviews and have to agree with most of the other 1-star reviews. The blades seem dull and do not slice well. If I apply more pressure to force the food through the blade I often lose the thickness adjustment and the slices are too thick. I usually end up using my chef's knife and the mandoline stays in the drawer. I should probably put it in the yard sale box or donate it to Goodwill. All-in-all, not one of my better purchases."
1,Opps - Slicer,"Cons: Because of poor quality, the price. Plastic casting burs left over from manufacturing make inserting the blades very difficult; along with sloppy tolerances cause the rubber feet to fall out often. Light weight, not enough mass in the pusher handle/knob, or the base unit. (it's all hollow plastic)Pros: Lots of cutting blades in a nice little translucent snap lid box. Unit folds up for storage.I'm very unhappy with this purchase."
4,Works fine,"I use this piece about once a month for light to medium duty veggie slicing and have had it for about 12 months. I'm a chef and use much more expensive stainless steel mandolins at work. For my home, this has worked fine and I believe it will work for many years to come. It doesn't feel as stable as heavy models but slices and dices with the best of them. I rarely use the holder, just be really really careful. I have julienned my finger at work before!"
1,Awkward to use and hard to slice,"The mandoline looks nice witht the stainless steel, however, it's not usable. Unless you have large hands, the food holder is hard to grasp which made it unusable to me. The horizontal placing of the food blade made it difficult to cut anything hard like carrots. You would need to exert more pressure than using a knife. I tried to use it several times thinking maybe I am not using it right. After using it several times on different vegetables, I have concluded that it's easier to just use the knife. The only thing that it can cut better than a knife are paper thin slices of cucumber. Otherwise it would be safer and quicker to cut with a knife.It's a waste of money unless you want to cut something that has the firmness of a cucumber without being too firm or soft."
4,"It Was Difficult For Me To Give This ""Only"" Four Stars...","...however, I personally feel this is a pretty accurate rating (based on my high expectations from this *great* band, of course).There are three songs on this album that make the purchase of it 100% worthwhile: ""Se Fossi Cosa"" alone comes to mind immediately. This song has profound lyrics and a beautiful blend of instrumentation that is guaranteed to keep one hitting the ""repeat"" buttom on your CD player over and over again.I won't spoil the the rest of the secrets of this album by revealing them to you...those who know PFM well will surely discover them."
1,A Pedestrian Discourse on an Interesting Topic,"This book's jacket promises ""The Latest Instruments, Portfolio Strategies, and Valuation Analysis."" A pretty tall order which, not surprisingly, this book does not deliver, in my humble opinion.I found the analytical sections particularly incomplete and essentially unusable.Convertible securities combine the appeal of simplicity with the opportunity for serious quantitative analysis. When this book deals with the simple ideas, it does ok. When it ventures into quant-land, I found the short-comings unbearable.I am sorry to have such a negative opinion. Perhaps other, more enlightened, readers will find redeeming attributes in this book that excaped me."
1,Content free,"To even to most junior quant, this book would be content free. What's more, he promises the revolutionary new Calamos valuation method (now, not even Nobel prize winners name their theories after themselves, they let other people do it for them, so already, suspicion) but again, nothing, just some snapshots from the screen of his software. The book blurb is misleading, it actually promises the method, not just an advert for it. Do not buy this book, you will learn nothing."
2,worth about 10 bucks,"like most blackjack books, its filled with basic info. but its a pretty decent book for someone who wants to learn the basic strategy, the rules and a little psychology advice when playing. for 10 bucks, its a decent enough pile of information, its a quick read and tells you what you need to know to play well. avery keeps trying to advertise his counting systems a little too much though. million dollar blackjack costs twice as much and has 100 times more info... and covers counting systems without shelling out an extra 100 bucks"
3,Lost in Translation,"I was a very huge fan of this series growing up as a kid...andstill am. Even though this collection of episodes are probablythe worst of the entire series run, I felt obligated to add themso that after season 3 is released I will have the entire sagato watch whenever I please. My displeasure of this collectionfalls more on the bonus features, which according to the boxare ""Rare 1966 interviews with original cast members, JuneLockhart, Guy Williams and Jonathan Harris"". What a bigdisappointment to find out that these are RADIO interviews.So while you listen to a very short and boring interview, you view a slide show of stills from the series....and stills anyfan of the show has seen thousands of times. I found this allto be very misleading. Shame on you FOX!!!! I would love to seebonus material such as bloopers or home movies shoy on the setin future volumes. Even a Bill Mumy comentary would be nice."
4,Two Sets OK With Me Too,"I purchased my ""Star Trek TOS"" series as 2-episodes per DVD disk pak, and would do again for the ""Lost In Space"" series. I am glad it is available in *any* form on DVD. The wait has been too long already. I would also suggest fans of other Irwin Allen series band together and purchase these, as I will purchase DVD release of ""Time Tunnel"" and ""Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea"" when they are 'ever' released (if I have not died from old age by then). My only requirement is that the DVD's be a higher image quality than a VHS tape. Anything beyond that is great."
5,PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 3,Keep em coming.The sooner season 3 comes out the better.Hopefully it will come out in a complete set but 2 sets is still ok as long as they release the third season.I will be getting volume 2 of season 2 in december.Must have season 3 also.KEEP EM COMING!!!!!!!!
2,LOST IN A PSYCO-WORLD!!!!,"What really started out with as a serious family sci-fi adventure-drama....to me....fell completely flat!!!! With the exception of maybe two episodes worth mentioning that I enjoyed; including ""TRIP THROUGH THE ROBOT"" and ""THE MECHANICAL MEN"" with all the little toy robot look-a-likes; everything else was too campy; too comic bookish; especially with all the dyhards going also full guns for ABC's BATMAN at the same time: I lost all interest in the rest of season#2!!!!Until season#3 started....then the adventure and the excitement returned!!!!TO BE CONTINUED........SAME PAGE........SAME CHANNEL!!!!"
4,Excelente,"En realidad es una excelente adquisición, lo recomiendo a cualquier fan de Perdidos en el Espacio. Como siempre la entrega fue rápida y eficiente."
4,Lost In Space Series,My husband and I was a great fan of the TV Lost in Space Series.Never liked to miss. These always kept us wondering what the nextshow would bring.Good family vewing.
4,"Lost in Space Season 2, Volume 2","I enjoyed this very much. It is always nice to go back in time to when you were growing up. Also, with all the special effects used today, it is great fun to watch something where the acting ability of the stars and the stories had to keep you attention."
5,5 Star Sensation!,"Lost In Space is a must for any Sci-Fi fan! Just Dr. Smith and the Robot alone make this series superb and a 5 Star sensation in my book! A great buy and one that you can enjoy over and over again! Sure some of the episodes are a bit silly, but it does make you wonder what you would do if you were stranded on a lost planet of which I hope I never find out!"
5,lost in space vol 2,i think these episodes are alot better than vol 1. now we need to get to season 3. season 1 and 3 are my favorite years with the robinson family. junkyard in space is the last episode in season 3. the show was canceled. but dont they film 2 weeks ahead. there might be 2 lost episodes that did not make it on tv. if so i hope they add it on as bonus episodes.
1,Forget it FOX!,"Well I stand corrected. I thought nothing would keep me from buying the two volume set of the second season of my favorite television show, Lost in Space, but I was wrong. After seeing Fox release these volumes with absolutely NO extras I decided just to keep watching my VHS episodes. It is absolutely unthinkable with all the extras available to them, not to mention a very cooperative cast, that they have given us NOTHING extra. NOT ONE THING! Where are the promos? Where are the commentary tracks? They sure aren't on these DVDs. I thought the first season box set was skimpy enough but I bought it anyway in anticipation of what was to come. Unfortunately NOTHING was to come. I don't care if you relase the third season in one, two, or twenty sets Fox, if you don't put any extras on them I'm going to save my money for another company's products that include extras!"
2,Why more expensive than Season 2 Vol 1 ??,"Another twist to disgruntle LIS fans, who really wanted LIS Season Two in a single complete second season DVD set. Why is the Season Two Vol 2 set selling for more on Amazon than the Season Two Vol 1 set? In total, buying the two separate Season Two sets are more expensive together than the single Season One set was at issue. That is just what many buyers feared would happen. Enough said. I'm fortunate to have a multi-region DVD player, so I bought the single box Season Two set from the United Kingdom release. It's great."
5,lost in space season 2 vol 2,I know its not released yet but i dont know why they broke them up like that when season 1 wasent....
2,Silly- A$$ 2nd season stupidity!,Can't we just forget there was a second season and get to the much better 3rd season? Well will still have the stupid carrot dude to deal with.
2,white gold turns yellow,"I was thrilled to receive this ring in May this year. I combined the ring with a beautifully cut diamond and have enjoyed wearing it very much until recently. Since a couple of weeks my beautifull 18k white gold ring is turning yellow. Apparently I received a yellow gold ring with a thin white gold coating???As an international customer, what to do? I don't want to just send my diamond accross the ocean, but I'm not happy with the color of my ring."
2,toy shorted out in less than 24 hours,"This loader shorted out in less than 24 hours after it arrived, same exact thing happened with the dump truck we bought at the same time. Even with new batteries it will not make noise anymore and that was the best part for my son. The loader all of a sudden started making a funny noise and wouldn't shut off until we took the batteries out. I am very disapointed that both the loader and the dump truck did the same thing. They never got wet or anything!"
2,Unfinished,"This book is small, expensive and relatively bad. While there are plenty of errors to be annoyed by (everything from incorrect solutions to syntax errors in the mathematics), my main qualm with the book comes from the poorly motivated text. While the underlying structure is suitable, the overall exposition is crap. The text reads like lecture notes, and I don't think it is quite up to the standard of a textbook. The exercises also need some work; there should be more exercises that are more interesting. As a mathematics major I am not all too impressed with it, but a student of an applied science may like it more. Although in this form I don't think it is suitable for any audience.If you want to learn Vector Calculus, I would suggest the multivariable/vector analysis sections of Stewart's Calculus text. That is where I learned the material. Vector Calculus by Marsden also seems promising, but I have not read it all yet."
4,Solid Product,"These hub caps look great. They look slightly different than the ones listed on Amazon, but no problem.The retention ring is too big for 15"" wheels. I had to force them onto my wheels."
1,junk,"don't waste your money on this crappy camera. you'd be better off buying a disposable. flash doesn't work, poor quality pictures, just a big mistake as far as a purchase."
3,Eh ok but makes me feel off,"This product does deliver in the energy department. I take one pill in the morning and one pill around 3. This gives me plenty of energy to last the day, but I am still able to go to sleep at night. With that said be careful with this pill. On my second day I decided to take the recommended 3 pills. Huge mistake. I felt off after I took the 3rd pill. I wasn't jittery or shaky but I felt hot, my pulse was really fast and I was light headed. When I looked at myself in the mirror my face and neck were bright red. I had to put a cold cloth on my face and take deep breathes to calm down. Needless to say, I didn't take any for a few days. Another problem I have with this pill is that it doesn't suppress my appetite.All in all I won't buy this product again. I gave it three stars because it does deliver on the energy without the shakes but too much of it and-at least it seemed to me-to raise your blood pressure."
4,good stuff,these things work good but again you must combine a good workout plan to get the results your looking for along with a eating plan as well
2,no sleep allowed,If you don't mind fitfull sleeping when you do sleep its an okay product. Just remember rest is also important for a healthy lifestyle and this doesn't allow appropriate rest. It is not a good appetite control either. Energy was great...but as stated you need to rest also.
4,"Good book, but nothing extraordinary","This is a good book on security and covers most of the SQL security issues. It even goes in depth in describing the SQL security at the network layer. But if you already know that you should use Windows authentication, not use SA or other SQL accounts, stay away from port 1433, and regularly update SQL security patches, then you probably won't benefit substantially by reading this book. Nevertheless, it provides a comprehensive review of the SQL security."
5,A holistic approach to security,"If you are responsible for a SQL Server database, can you afford not to think about security? Of course not. And this book definitely puts you on the right track. It offers a great great and encompassing view of the issues we as IT professionals face when it comes to SQL Server Security. It's not the same old best practices, rather it explains the why's behind the how's."
5,Good Read,"Have enjoyed all his books, very entertaining. Waiting for more books from this author. Simon writes under several different names, so check them all out.Thanks, Martha Jean"
4,Almost Perfect,"I loved everything about this one, althought I would have liked to see a little more catfighting between Giles and Tristen. The mystery was great and I was very surprised by who the killer was. Also I love a happy ending to a story. I just hope theres many more mysterys to come."
2,Not amazing,"This bit was extremely brittle. I Understand that is their nature, however I have found much stronger bits elsewhere. For the price, though, it was hard to go wrong."
1,Unwatchable,"Apparently I'm a stick-in-the-mud, an old-fashioned sort who wants plot and/or characters in a film. ""XX"" strikes me as a self-indulgent film-school effort that must have been privately released by a vanity press. The soundtrack is annoying, the characters (such as they are) uniformly unlikeable, the film grainy (yes yes, I'm sure that's an ""artistic effect,"" like leaving bits of eggshell in the omelet), any sort of ""plot"" missing altogether, and the whole thing largely unbearable, even on fast-forward (no, don't bother, nothing ever happens). It even manages to make sex dull, which is no small achievement. On the other hand, the filmmaker has finally pushed Richard Gere's KING DAVID out of my Number One Worst Movie Ever spot, which nobody else has achieved in the last 20 years, so I suppose that's something. I don't even know anyone to GIVE this to."
1,THE VERY WORST IN GAY CINEMA,Simply the worst gay film in a long time.Looks like someone's bad home movie.Annoying soundtrack and no plot of any sort.Why should anyone pay to see this film? Dont waste your time.
4,Great afternoon tea,"I love this tea for a relaxing tea in the late afternoon, just a bit of sweetness. Good tea for the regular tea bunch with just enough flavor to feel like a real treat."
5,Yummy! Great gift ideas.,I really enjoy this product. I realize that this tea comes in packs of 6 and that means 120 tea bags but they are great gifts. The tea made with milk and sugar is dessert.
2,The tea expired a long long time ago...,The tea expired a long long time ago 2006 to be exact... It is still good but the taste is not there and take more then one tea bag to get any decent taste out of them.
2,Gag me with a spoon,"Lipton Black Tea, Vanilla Caramel Truffle, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)Please try this tea before purchasing more than one box. I poured out my first cup after just a couple of sips and threw away the rest. The flavor is very strong and distinct (think coffee and butterscotch). If it doesn't suit you, it is impossible to ignore."
3,"OK, but not quite my cup of tea.","I love caramel tea, having discovering it in Amsterdam a few years ago. I was disappointed in this one, though. It has a slightly ""flowery"" taste to me, and not enough caramel or vanilla aftertaste. I've tried other brands and love them, but this one just left me flat. I'll keep drinking it, of course, since I bought a large supply, but will add my sugar free caramel syrup to it to get the extra kick I need."
1,Horrible tasting,"I like vanilla and I like caramel. This didn't taste like vanilla or caramel. stay away from this... I was disappointed at this, but fortunately I only purchased one box to try it out."
3,I have mixed feelings about this flavor,"The first few times I tried it I thought it tasted ""musty"", but I decided to try it again. With vanilla creamer it is very good. When it is brewed at least 5 minutes makes the caramel taste ""come out"". I tried it last night as an iced tea and it was exotic. It is not a flavor for everyone, and I recommed buying a single box, before making a case commitment. I drank it in the middle of my night shift for desert-like, calorie free boost."
3,mixed reaction,"Bought this tea because the brand my husband and I love - (lipton bavarian wild berry) was sold out on amazon... my husband hates this variety I think it is okay has a coffee like flavor, I make mine with an iced tea maker so I can't say if would be better brewed longer. One thing I noticed is using 4 tea bags doesn't seem to get me as many batches of tea as I usually get, but I can be stingy with my tea."
4,A VERY HELPFUL GUIDE TO LEONARDO'S ARTISTIC CAREER.,"THIS BRIEF VOLUME ON LEONARDO IS CLEARLY NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE BIOGRAPHY, NOR DOES IT PROVIDE A DETAILED ANAYSIS OF EACH SURVIVING MASTERPIECE. IN 116 PAGES OF TEXT, SUCH A TASK IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE. WHAT IS PROVIDED IS A CONCISE AND VERY WELL-ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO LEONARDO'S OUTPUT AS PAINTER. IN THIS REGARD THE VOLUME WORKS QUITE WELL, AND THE ILLUSTRATIONS AND DETAILS FURNISHED ARE REAL STRENGTHS. I FOUND THE COMPANION VOLUME FROM THIS SERIES ON CARAVAGGIO AN EXCELLENT COMPANION TO PETER RABB'S BIOGRAPHY OF THAT PAINTER, AND I EXPECT THAT THE LEONARDO VOLUME WOULD BE EQUALLY USEFUL AS A GUIDE IN THE READING OF A MORE DETAILED BIOGRAPHY OR STUDY."
2,Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,If you see the movie by the same title as the book you will be better off. The movie has more action than the book. Usually the norm is the book is better than movie in this instance it is not the case. In the movie the setting is during the Napolionic era and chasing a French frigate. In the book the setting is during the War of 1812 and chasing the American Frigate Norfolk. The book explains the lives of seamen at sea during that era. No great naval encounters like in the movie. I could not wait to finish this book and place it on the bookshelf under never to be touched again. To think that I need to read the first book of this series Master and Commander. That will take a while before I read that book.
4,"Dixie Chicks ""Ready To Run"" Single Review","This song is cool. This release has not only ""Ready To Run"" but also ""Wide Open Spaces"" which is also a great song. This group is so-to-say a little of both pop and country, this album on the fast tracks they go with the pop flavor, and on the slower ones they go with their country roots. This Dixie Chicks album is something special because you cannot get it in regular stores. If you completely love this song and not the ""Fly"" album, then you got to get this, if you are a fan of both Ready to Run and Wide Open Spaces then get this cause it is hot. Both of these tracks have been burning up the country air waves with request after request and fans have been getting the full album with just liking the top hits, don't make the same mistake, buy this, it will make your life a little easier than to have a bunch of nonsense tracks that you have to skip over time after time."
4,"Thoughtful, Fresh, and Unafraid","Actor Shane Brolly recently starred in the movie ""Underworld"", and while the movie did reasonably well at the box office, critics did not attribute that sucess to his performance. Perhaps an inexperienced actor, Brolly is a natural poet. Totally raw, his images and language accost readers, confronting them with themes and ideas so common to the human experience that we trudge through life ignoring them. Brolly's poems remind us what it is to be frustrated with our own apathy. He screams at readers about his inability to escape the net of expectations; he wants to do so much - be so much - and yet, those very wants keep him from placing his first step. In the face of such magnitude of purpose, where can he begin?Particularly effective is a poem entitled ""two doves"" which dazzles in its simplicity. Brolly is a man to watch; his rough words name-call and curse, and his purpose whispers almost silently."
2,Not as expected,Like it but made the mistake of not really knowing how small this really is when I opened this Spark box it was like a needle in a hay stack.
3,Cable snow chains need quality improvement,"I bought these chains because they are called for in my Honda CR-V manual. They fit.In the box, Radial Chain LT looked like they had been used - dusty, corrosion, no instructions - but they were new.I installed them during fine weather but could not fit all the end-bushings throught the end-hook. I had to grind the burrs off the bushings so they would fit through the end-hook easily. They would have failed to be useful if trying to install them when needed for traction.I decided to keep them and make them work because they fit my car which has little clearance.Be sure to test them before trying to install them while lying in the snow.Ken"
5,go in snow,"Great zero clearance snow chains, need to use rubber tighteners. Almost as much traction as regular cross bar chains. Work better on the front axle. I run traction aids on all drive tires when pushing snow. May try on rears next season."
3,So-So,"Bought these chains for 2011 Honda CR-V. These are the cables/chains that were recommended by the owners manual. They arrived in good time, a couple of days. Was dissapointed that cables came in a cardboard box and not a plastic box. Used them for a snowboard trip to Lake Tahoe. The cables were easy enough to put on but required me to lay down in the snow and mud to put on. Will travel with large plastic bag next time to lay down on. Cables worked well during driving, never came off during about 30 miles of mountain driving. Bottom line there are better cables out there but for the price, these work o.k.. If i needed to use cables often I would purchase other more expensive cables."
2,From Lake Geneva to the Montreal station?,"Well, what should I say? I guess this record has just 'historical' value, because it contains the earliest versions of WEG the boys had done with Bobby O. The original mix is interesting, obviously, as well as the acid house mix. But the James Brown mix and Montreal mixes seems to me as total crap and just a few people would be able to listen this CD from start to end."
2,Pet Shop Boys - Montreal mixes - 7 total by XYZ Records,"A couple mixes (the Monreal ones) are okay. The cd was recorded VERY badly. The volume level of each song is dramatically different and needs to be adjusted for each song you listen to. There is also a distinct muted quality - songs sound muffled and lack any warmth, fullness or richness. Bobby O was involved in these mixes (He really knows what he's doing and is responcible for lots of great stuff)so I think that the majority of the problem is not the mixes themselves but with quality control of XYZ records. Re-released stuff like this by small companies with unknown audio recording equipment can be a crap shoot but its often the only way to obtain these mixes. Just getting a bad cd is very very unusual and since a cd is an exact copy I'd be leery of ordering. I did turn them into mp3s and was able to dramatically improve their sound and level out the volume. You could do this or save money - get a used copy."
1,Keep expectations low,"This is just a warning. This is not the actual original single for West End Girls and it is not even released by Pet Shop Boys record label. Although the mixes are decent for their time, their novelty soon wears thin. The sound quality is shotty, as other reviewers have noted. I consider myself to be a true fan of PSB and try to collect as much as I can get my hands on. But this release comes off as unauthentic and weak. A ""MUST HAVE"" for only those that are TRULY die-hard fans of PSB.Fyi: If you are a fan of the song itself, a very decent remix by SASHA was officially released as a B-side track on the single for ""I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing."" This same mix is later included on the limited edition of POPART, the collected singles of the Pet Shop Boys that was released last year. This latter has a better sound quality simply because it was released over a decade later.I would sooner recommend these CD's than the one you are currently looking at."
5,Movies the whole family can enjoy!!!,"This wondeful collection takes viewers back to more gentle times, pruddish, yes, but enjoyable with all the family, well acted and very amuzing. Doris Day is beautiful, atractive and such a joy to watch, and Mr. Hudson, is the actor everybody enjoyed, i so many many movies. Tony Randall and the supporting bunch, made this era unforgetable. The music, the custtomes, it all works together to make your family share those times at the movies"
5,Nice gift!,"I purchased the new Doris Day CD for my mom for Christmas and decided to pair it with this DVD, she loved it! As my mom tells me all the time, they do not make nice movies anymore and there's nothing nice to watch on tv."
5,Light Hearted Fun,These are still good for a laugh and a bit of nostalgia. I know Doris Day got tired of the roles she was cast into but she was the perfect stereotype for the 'good' girl of that time. These are fun movies and Doris and Rock were at their best in comedy. Both were good dramatic actors as well but these are classic and worth watching when you want to just relax and laugh.
4,no problems with delivery fun movies,"fun movies then and now - these movies will always be fun standbys for this time and what the country was looking for, for entertainment at the time"
4,"Love the product, was missing an item","I couldn't find this anywhere else and had to buy it used, but the seller didn't state that it was missing the soundtrack CD that went with it. Was incredibly disappointed that the CD was missing. But I love the movies and I try to keep pretty good care of it since it's hard to find the set and this is used already. Fun packaging with the three discs in a box that pulls put with a ribbon. Very girly. Great vintage pictures of the movies on the packaging."
5,Doris Day Comedy Collection,"The Doris Day & Rock Hudson Comedy Collection is well worth purchasing. If you like clean, wholesome fun in the movies than this is it. They don't make movies like this anymore."
4,Faults in Item,"The package I received had the shrink wrap removed, and the color was noticeably off several times during the movie Pillow Talk. Several times the faces were obviously red and would turn light as if someone had turned off a red spot light. Then the colors would return to their natural shades. Jim N 9/15/07"
5,Doris and Rock...What more can I say,"I have enjoyed Doris Day movies since I was a teenager, and Rock Hudson just adds to the comedic chemistry. To have these three movies is great. To have them all on one DVD is priceless. My children, now in their 30s, are rapidly becoming Doris and Rock fans too. You've got to get this DVD."
5,Comedies at there best.,DVD is of great quality and decent fun. They don't make movies like these any more and these movies are a wonderful addition to any collection.
5,Collector set,"Can never go wrong with Doris Day! Yes, I still have a VHS player and it was quality condition.Still watch a few times a month."
2,What? They've already released these...,"These exact three movies have already been released as a collection titled the Doris Day/Rock Hudson Romance Collection. The packaging for the earlier collection is much nicer, so this is in every way a step down. I give the movies 4 stars because they're great. I give this release 0 stars because it's so lame they're releasing the exact same movies as a collection with a different name and a picture on the cover that's not their best. Average it together and you get the 2 stars."
5,Doris Day Collection,"The good thing about these sets is that you get ""some"" movies in one bundle. Since we collect it makes sense to us."
4,I'll pick you up at 8,"Love the flirty banter between Rock and Doris. She's even cute as button when she is on ""fire"". Tony Randall always delivers a solid comedic supporting role. I brought these movies with me on a long family stay. My 12-year-old nephew even found them humorous. So perhaps these movies are timeless!"
