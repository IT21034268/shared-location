5,Somewhat different but still amazing.,"Dave and the boys add a few new elements to their songs with incredible results. The mainstream hits such as crush and stay are great, but my favorite song has to be Pig. Must have CD."
4,"this album, dispite its legnth is great!!!","dave matthews band hit radios hard with the acoustic sounds of crash...crash was extremely hard to follow up and dmb did it nicely with before these crowded streets...with the 40 second opener dave introduces you to a guitar heaven assisted by drummer carter beauford...with the intricite rythms and detailed harmonies, before these crowed streets is an album you can listen to all of...it runs a little long with crush reaching almost nine minutes and dreaming tree with only two verses goes to 6 minutes...while somewhat repetitive, this album is sure to relax you, enflame you, and leave you feeling good...buy this album!!!"
4,"The best yet (through ""Busted Stuff"")","The band worked here to make an album (suggesting coherency and theme). Prior to this we saw more of a collection of songs that had the same mood and were put together on a cd. The lyrics in this one have that whole first person monologue mocking thing going...as in ""The Last Stop"" and ""Don't Drink the Water.""Their most experimentally successful album. Remarkably contagious rhythms, significant (though sometimes trite) lyrics, Bela Fleck's banjo adds a nice subtle touch, and that's about it. Pay attention to the intricacies and enjoy."
5,"great, real music","This cd is a must have for anyone who really like to listen to music. Eve 6 it's not and thank god. The band tapped into something that many of the Barenaked Lady and Third Eye Blind fans could never appreciate. You need to listen to, and feel the music and all that it expresses. Welcome to the world where musicians actually play their instruments and are some of the best in the business at thier craft. If for no other reason buy this cd because of Carter Beuford. He's the man and his drumming blows me away every time I hear it."
5,Dave Matthews has Struck again!!,"Dave Matthews is such a great band. They have sooo much talent! This cd is totally awesome! Crush is a GREAT song.... actually, most of the songs are great!!"
4,"Different, but still Dave","Took me two times straight through to really ""get"" this CD (very unlike Under the Table and Dreaming and Crash), but once I got the flow, I have been listening to it non-stop. If you like classic DMB, Rapunzel (song #2) and Stay (#5) are classic, fun, hard-driving, mega-jamming tunes. The rest of the CD is still upbeat, but seemingly more spiritual and dense than other Dave CDs. If you are a long-time fan of a band, you like when your artist's music develops and this is what this band has done with Before These Crowded Streets."
4,A delightful departure.,"BFTCS is a delightful departure from ealier DMB's earlier work that that takes risks but does not dissappoint. ""Rapunzel"" and ""Stay(Wasting Time)"" are upbeat danceable grooves. ""Halloween"" is an insanely creepy piece of loveable cacauphony. ""Don't Drink the Water"" and ""The Dreamin Tree"" are haunting, melodic achievements. ""Pig"" and ""Spoon"" are sweetly easy going. The albums great achievement is the provocative, startlingly romantic, groove-drenched ""Crush""."
4,a showcase of musical talent but lacking zeal...,"I heard the disc just yesterday and I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I had high expectations--maybe too high though. I loved the last two albums regardless of Dave's obsession with things of the sexual nature...they were a new music sound to my pop weary ears. Crash and Under the Table and Dreaming were both refreshing and exciting but Before Crowded Streets seems to lack the zeal the last two albums had. I remember hearing Ants Marching and not being able to get the song out of my head as well as several other songs on both that disc and Crash, but Before... lacks that element. I was impressed with the diversity of music and the use of various instruments (i.e. the bandjoe) but I wanted more. I wanted a disc to listen to over summer and feel refreshed. Maybe I just need to listen to it and few hundred times more..."
5,Good but not as good as Crash,"The older stuff is better but this CD is great, Dave can't do a bad CD."
3,Not their best but still good,"This album is their darkest, incorporating a rich, sonorous blend of sounds that at times borders on the ridiculous with Matthews' falsetto vocals, especially in songs like ""Halloween,"" which sounds absolutely horrendous on this album but is actually a great song live. Only the Recently EP version and other live versions of this song do it justice."
2,Not Their Best,"I am a big Dave Matthews Band fan and am very impressed by his past albums. This album, however, does not live up to their reputation. Every song has an undertone of angst about fame and the lyrics are less than creative. The actual music does have merit in that the band has decided to experiment but songs like Crush and Pig leave sonething to be desired in terms of both lyrics and music. Also, it seems this album was just made to fill there fans' demand (as the title suggests). Each song has a parallel on one of their previous albums, but not as well done as the the song each reflects. I would definately recommend buying ""Under the Table and Dreaming"" and ""Crash"" before this album."
5,A solid album attempting new angles,"Take it from someone who is not quite a Dave Matthews Band fan - yet, which means you don't get a fanatical raving of the CD. It is a great album, solid and uniform, much like any other Dave Matthews Band CD. Although this one does sound a little different from ""Crash"", it cannot be compared to it. ""BTCS"" takes you on a journey through many musical styles, and leaves you deeply moved if you really listen to the soul of the songs. ""Don't Drink The Water"" is a high point, especially the ending where he and Alanis do a counterpoint. But don't expect this album to be laid back: ""Crash"" was a relaxing, soothing experience; ""BTCS"" is powerful and moving, and far less subtle. All in all, I'd suggest that this is a worthwhile extention of your CD collection. It makes for interesting listening."
5,Excellent,"Oh god where do I begin with how great this cd is? Its the type of cd that makes you put your fist in the air and yell, and then at parts where the songs get extremely good, not just very good, it inspires you to hit the wall with your fist, all the while screaming the lyrics. Again, a great cd that makes you put your fist in the air and yell Joe Krause-style."
3,Not like his other stuff,"This cd is very different from their previous work. Although it does not necessarily mean it's worse, its just a drastic change. The first 6 songs are in general dark. They seem to have a middle eastern tone. As for the rest of the cd, it's really good. Songs like Stone and Spoon and The Dreaming Tree resemble all of Dave's earlier work. I would reccomend this cd only to somebody who has at least two of the DMB cd's and wants to try out another one."
3,a good cd but not the best,"i got this cd in the summer of 98 and i loved it and listened to it all the time. i probably would've given it a 5, but after a while it gets old unless of course you're one of those really big dave fans. however, this cd is very good in general. i find it better than his previous albums. but some of the best songs on this cd in my opinion are not the ones that you hear on the radio like dont drink the water, stay, or crush. i think the best songs on this cd are the stone, the dreaming tree, and halloween. i found that most people loved dave at first but moved on to other bands fairly quickly and dave got a back seat. i'm not saying that this cd is bad though, just one that stays in its case most of the time after listening to it enough times."
5,Spectacular,"It's been probably seven years since I've listened to this album, and just tonight I became reacquainted with it. These are honestly some of the most masterful auditory sounds I've ever heard. The definition of beautiful music.It's rare that any album contains just one song that can make me feel like I'm in another world; this album contains three: Spoon (it is painful how perfect this song is), the Stone, and the Dreaming Tree. Pig and Crush are up there too.PS - Like I said, it's been awhile, but when I was younger my DMB friend insisted that Under the Table and Dreaming was better. I've always highly preferred Before These Crowded Streets (seriously, those last five songs... inexplicably beautiful...)"
5,THE BEST OF WHAT'S AROUND!!,I think this CD is much different from all of his other albums. It is a lot more slower moving and not so upbeat. But this is defenatley a feel good CD and it really makes you wonder what his next CD will be like. I can't wait.
4,excellent writing,"Dave Matthews proves to be one of the finest songwriters since Tom Arico. Not only will the MTV friendly single ""Dont Drink the Water"" bring the Dave Matthews Band into the mainstream rock arena, songs like ""Stay"" show the band is not afraid to remain with the style and brightness they have built their early following on. The softness of the guitars mixed with the moaning vocal style are a fantastic alternative to typical breakthrough college radio bands."
4,"Excellent Music-Melanchy, Sad, Etheral, Angry!","I Love this CD! Very different type for DM, angry, rageful in places, sad lost in others, you can hear the feeling through the strings! Wonderful record, try it!! Especially good for moods when you cannot put things into words."
5,an invigorating recording that will mature very nicely,"A strong example of blending music of varied origin into harmonies that expose music fans to different and even foreign sounds. The album is quite consistent with the band's previous releases. To put it simply, BRAVO!"
3,where is the guitar Dave ???,"This album is by far the worst Dave album yet. Believe me when i say that i worship Dave, this was definitely a big dissapointment. The perfect word to describe this album is ""over-produced"". Dave's guitar, with it's funky chords, should be what you hear most, not all the affects and backround guests ( i hate the women singing ). And what's up with Halloween. Please if you want to hear this song the way it should be played, go out and get the Recently cd. And as for Dave, I hope he starts to listen to his old stuff again. And as for the Studio people, leave the band alone. Stop trying to blend all the instruments together, and let them stand out on their own. This is why Dave is so much better in concert, they just jam freely. I hope they try to bring some of that into their next album."
3,Not a show stopper...,"This album is certainly not for the first-time buyer of DMB. To get a true taste of what has made the band big, start with Under the Table or even Crash. This album is more explorative and the band experiments more. The CD does have its share of hits. ""Crush"" is absolutely sublime. ""Don't Drink..."" and ""The Last Stop"" hit you with driving rhythms. But this CD also has maybe the worst song I've heard from DMB: ""Halloween"""
3,Not So Solid!,"Although there are a few shining moments(Stay, Rapunzel), I don't find it nearly as enjoyable as Crash. Crash is a solid album that I can listen all the way through, this isn't so with Before These Crowded Streets!!!SORRY DAVE!"
3,I only bought this because of Crash,"I thought, ""Wow, another Dave Matthews' CD, can't wait"", but was surely disappointed when I heard the first run-through and didn't hear my Dave Matthews. I can appreciate their talent and ingenuity in music, but cannot understand what they were trying to do here with album number three. I love Under the Table, and I can't live without Crash, but I don't think I would cry a river if These Crowded Streets got stolen. Sorry Dave, still love ya."
3,Not their best work.,"I feel this album lacks something. Tracks # 4 & 1 are my favorites, everything elce seems ""ordianry"" (but likable). The album doesn't express the band's charecteristic ""zip"".For the record, however, it's worth listening to. Expect a different vibe."
1,NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!,"This is NOT the way to make an album! Listen up all you up-and-coming bands: If you EVER make the best album of your career, DO NOT follow it up with something like THIS! Capitalizing on the success of the great ""Crash"" album, Dave And His Anonymous Band Of Virtuoso Musicians substitute banjo playing and Alanis Morrisette for actual MELODIES! Ever heard ""Don't Drink The Water""? Ever notice that you can't hum it in your head? You know why? BECAUSE IT HAS NO MELODY! ""Rapunzel"" is absolutely gross. ""Pig"" is just stupid. Oh and for the record ""Halloween"" may very well be the worst, most annoying song I've EVER heard! And I've heard's R.E.M.'s ""Burning Hell""!""Crush"" is great though. Dig that bass line!"
2,A failed experiment,"With BEFORE THESE CROWDED STREETS, you can feel DMB trying to stretch. The main problem is that it stretches a too thin. The songs are all over the place musically; at no point can the listener make a connection to the CD as a whole. Middle Eastern rhythms, faux classical, a little country, are thrown together in an unappealing mess. Songs meander, than eventually peter out without any real payoff. There are no hooks to hang on to and no melodies worth remembering. Vocally, Matthews goes from falsetto to growling without any real purpose. It only makes the listener wonder, ""Why is he doing this?"" And that pretty much sums up the whole recording. I don't feel artists should go stagnant; growth is important. But in this case, it really doesn't work."
2,Failure to Warn,Seller failed to warn buyers that the last three tracks are unplayable due to skipping. Seller stated that CD was in good or great condition (I don't remember which). I will be avoiding the seller in the future.
2,"Dave, why are you so angry ???","Weak effort. Throw out ""Crush"", and the rest of the album is an awful mess. ""Don't Drink the Water"", ""The Last Stop"" and ""Halloween"" are a dramatic change from Dave's usual playfulness and hopeless romanticism. Dave sounds angry in these songs and I don't like it. Dave is at his best when he is having fun(""Ants Marching"" and ""Dancing Nancies"")and he when he brings it down a notch (""Crash"" and ""Satellite""). No more grumpy Dave; bring back the nice guy we all learned to love."
2,yuch,This album has only three listenable songs. All three are radio hits. The others are boring and stupid. I can't stand most of the songs and the price is not worth it.
2,A disappointment,"I loved the Crash CD and was looking forward to this one. This was nothing like Crash. It was weird. They must be trying a new sound, but I don't like. For those who like the sound of Crash, I don't recommend it."
2,"Creepy, scary sound","I am a big fan of the Dave Matthews Band, but this album really turns me off. Almost every song on the album has a creepy, nasty sound that leaves me feeling disturbed and irritated. The singing consists mostly of angry growling. I simply do not enjoy listening to this album, and this surprises me, since I still listen to Crash three or four times a week and enjoy every song."
3,Thanks for the effort...,"As I'll anger the world's most fervent fan base by my opinion here, I'll try and give Dave Matthews Band a little credit - any artist nowadays needs to be praised for having ambition, and Before These Crowded Streets is full of it - big, long, crushing, over-the top ambition. Matthews wants to make an enormous record in just 11 songs, attempting a love-spirituality-personal growth melee meant to establish Matthews's credibility as an artist with ideas as grand as the legends of his live sets. The result is for one moment boldly, excitingly grand (""The Stone""), but mostly it's overwraught (""Pig""), pretentious (""The Dreaming Tree""), and even a bit exhausting (""Halloween""). The more casual digressions, the ones Matthews may have thought as throwaway compared with the more elaborate compositions around them - ""Stay"" and ""Spoon"" succeed because they don't wreak of effort. The rest of the album is not as lucky."
5,"Excellent, Lush Album","This is a very ambitious album which I think is first rate. The compositions are rich and full. The songs flow well and never become excessive, despite their length. I also enjoy the pieces joining each song together. This disc also contains some of the bands darkest material, reminiscient of Rhyme & Reason from Under the Table. Where Under the Table gave the sense of a bright sunny day at the fair, this disc, with the exception of Stay, feels like a dark night. A truly satisfying listening experience."
5,sexy and beautiful,"This is the album that got me hooked on DMB. Just plug this baby into your headset and go lay out in the sunshine, and I can promise you, you won't be bored for a second. The music is sexy and cool and beautiful and makes you want to learn how to play base. If you like the albums before, you will not be disapointed with this one. It's lovely."
5,Pure Genius!,"Okay, let me just start out by saying that Dave Matthews is THE best music artist in the world today. When I put this CD on for the first time I wanted to melt all over my bedroom floor and weep with happiness. I have all of his CDs but this has got to be number one for me. Anybody that has a CD player(or a tape player if you're behind times) needs to own a copy of Before These Crowded Streets there's no doubt about it. Whenever I hear Crush I could just lose control of my bladder it's so incredibly GOOD! Just talking about it makes me wanna go listen to it right now! C'mon people, buy it,it totally rocks!No joke."
1,BAAAD,This is a very bad cd. The songs have no rythm and are very boring. You could do soo much better than this cd.
1,Can you say overrated?,"Dave Matthews and his cohorts are the most overrated group of musicians on the planet. They have talent at playing their instruments, but they have absolutely no songwriting skills. Some of their songs are catchy, but most of them are boring, expecially ""Don't Drink the Water."" Some people say that they're original, but using a violin and a Kenny-G-like sax doesn't make up for formulaic songs."
2,Not nearly as good as earlier albums,"This one is way too hard -- too much evil-sounding, downer music. What happened to the honest, eager sound from before? DMB used to be lyrical. This is icky, dark, mesmerizing stuff -- I had to skip over some tracks just to get through it."
1,DAVE MATTHEWS WILL NEVER BE LIKE EDDIE VEDDER OR KURT COBAIN,This cd starts out slow. i really enjoyed crash but this album did nothing for me.eddie vedder dave will never be.
3,Okay,"DMB really does not live up to their earlier cd's""Under the Table and Dreaming"" and ""Crash"".""Before These Crowded Streets"" only has a few good tracks.I suggest DMB's earlier albums."
2,"Usually good, exeption here","Every one of all of the Dave Matthews CD's I have are great! This one surprised me though, definetly his worst so far."
3,Dave Matthews- Before These Crowded Streets,"The third album from DMB has it's good moments. Dave is always working to produce new and creative music, working with different sounds and thinking of new ideas. This CD, though, does not capture the raw creativity that ""Under the Table"" and ""crash"" expressed. it is still a good CD, and I would not count DMB out. While the musical world is in a tailspin as far as good quality and original music, DMB continues to do what they do best, and have forgotten the pop world around them."
4,DMB once again,"I am a HUGE DMB fan. I must say that I am not a big fan of this album. At first, I hated it. Then I started to like it. Some of the songs are excellent like ""The Stone"" and ""Crush""But the rest are really dark and Dave could have done better, he did prove himself on their newest album, ""Everyday"""
2,"It Just Isn't As Good As ""Crash"" or ""UTTAD""","Certainly the guys score some points for trying to do something different. However, if you're looking for ""Crash"" of ""UTTAD"", this ain't it.On the plus side you get a few gorgeous tunes such as ""Rapunzel"" and the singles ""Crush"" and ""Stay"".On the other hand, you get several tunes written in jarring chord progressions that abruptly bring the down the tone of the album. Unfortunately this occurs early with the painful ""The Last Stop"", followed by ""Don't Drink the Water"", one of their least memorable singles.Just when you think things are going to get back on track with ""Stay"" a few more clunkers follow. Do NOT let the other reviews trick you into thinking this is even CLOSE to his prior two CD's. Those reviews are likely written by fans who are trying to drum up sales - and they'll likely say this review was unhelpful just to prove my point.A better bet: Get ""Live at Luther College"". A far better CD which doesn't try so hard."
1,Dave needs to go back to the drawing board,"After two fine efforts Dave and his band of come up with a total lemon. The singles are weak and the rest is worse. I enjoyed Crash and Under... but the songs on this CD are full of mournful wailing and dejected lyrics. The musical interludes carry on for far too long and the ""Angry Dave"" section of ""Don't Drink the Water"" better reflects the CD as a whole than the flighty ""Stay"", the only reasonably enjoyable track. If you want to buy a DMB CD I suggest the previous two chart toppers - Stay Away from this one."
4,A unique but incredible CD,"After hearing that the Dave Matthews Band was recording a new album, I counted down the days until the release. I got the album the day it came out but it took a couple of run throughs first before I could say that I loved the CD. Crush, Pig, and Stay were immediate favorites. Rapunzel came with time, and every time I hear Don't Drink the Water I love it more and more. My underdog would have to be Spoon though. The combination of the banjo with Alanis Morrisette's eerie but melodic voice just sets the track apart. I wish that the band could turn a couple of those mini tunes at the end of songs into full tracks. Overall, this is a must-have for any Dave Matthews fan."
4,Most intense CD by the band,"I enjoy this CD more and more each time I listen to it. I can't get enough of songs, ""Crush"" and ""Spoon, track 8 and 11. I'm consistently please with each and every CD Dave puts out."
4,"Different, yet the same!","The first time I listened to this CD it struck me as too depressing and dark. However, the songs have grown on me and I can really appreciate the group's growing from Crash. This CD will really make you listen to the words behind all the screaming and hold on for more. Great CD for relaxing on a rainy day."
5,"Great, good wonderful,,the best","This CD is fantastic outstanding...All the songs are nice and different...Spoon is probably my favorite. Even if you are a fan or not, I'm sure you will adore it...."
4,"Good, but not up to par.","""Before these crowded Streets"" was good, no doubt, but compared to previous efforts, especially ""Crush"" and ""Under the Table"", ""Before"" just doesn't hold up. The darker tones, especially in the center of the CD, punctuated by the folky gospel ""Stay"", make the CD unbearable for a while. While i recommend that folks who enjoy DMB get it, for any first timers into Dave, I would suggest you get either ""Crush"" or ""Under the Table and Dreaming"" before listening to Dave on ""Before"""
2,Easing the pleasing,"2 1/2Disappointing follow-up to Crash attempts to recreate all the organic highs though more often comes across as soulfully contrived, stretching out thinly written material."
1,Dave is SO Overrated!,"I'm so disappointed in Dave and his band. The CD is pittiful compared to the other CDs he has made. Maybe it is just me, but I think everyone should buy GOO GOO DOLLS' CD ""Superstar Car Wash"". I recently bought ""Superstar Car Wash"" at the same time I bought ""Before These Crowded Streets"". I never was really a fan of the Goos, but after hearing Dave's latest CD, I decided to listen to the Goos more often. On Dave's CD, the band was really good, yet Dave was not. His vocals could have been a lot better, like on ""Crash"". On the Goo's CD, the vocals were unbelievable. They had harmony and a great beat. Hopefully, Dave will produce a better CD the next time around. Until then, I'll just be content with ""Superstar Car Wash"""
1,one of the most overrated bands ever,what is the big deal about this group? there music and arrangements are way over played and the words become way to wordy.dave matthews thinks that he is a cross between sting and paul simon or something.aside from the fiddler player there's nothing special for me about this over rated group.this album like the others of there's is one blur for me.
5,Gotta say best one yet!,"Being the obsessed fan I am, I was more than pleased with the album. Considering that some tunes were just thrown together in the studio for the first time, proves to me that the DMB is actually going back to what worked so brilliantly in ""Under the table..."" Which is just plain jammin' out! I thought that that aspect was missing in ""Crash."" All in all ""great!"" ""PIG"" was just amazing!"
5,DAVE MATTHEWS BAND IS AWSOME.,"DAVE MATTHEWS BAND IS GREAT, DAVE I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A PERSONAL FAVOR AND THAT IS TO MARRY ME.I PERSONALY LOVE THE WAY YOU KICK IT ON STAGE WITH YOUR SEX'Y WAY'S.I REALLY LOVE CRASH THAT CD IS GREAT AND IT'S MADE WAKING UP EVERY MORNING WORTH GETTING UP TO LISTEN TO IT LOVE MRS. MATTHEWS."
5,DMB strives to be different from everything else.,"The music on this album is very unique in today's music scene. Songs like ""Don't Drink the Water"" and ""Crush"" combine an excellent and interesting beat with meaningful lyrics. The album is complex ranging from fast pop songs like ""stay"" to integing melodies such as ""Holloween."" Most will find that the songs don't get repetitive or boring. I still listen to the CD constantly even though I have had it for over a year. The Dave Mathews Band strives to give us something different and unique to listen to, which is a good thing in today's world, where half of the music we hear is a remake or sampled from another artist."
5,One of the best albums of the decade.,"There's not much to say, really. This is the fruition of Dave Matthews Band's effort to become a complete band. And boy, have they. Easily their best effort to date, probably the best effort of 1998, and one of the best complete albums in the past 20 years."
5,One of the best in my collection,"While this CD is a departure from their other CD's it's also a venture into a whole new sound for The Dave Matthews Band. It's a beautiful CD with 11 insightful songs. My personal favorite is ""Crush"" because it truly depicts how a woman wants a man to really feel about her."
5,A beautiful album...,"This album and Crash have the most beautiful lyrics out of all my other CD's in my collection. Not only is the music very charming, but the duet that the band did with Alanis Morissette in this album could not have been anymore perfect. I shall always be a fan of this band that will always be my favorite."
5,Before Dave Matthews Band...,"...music used to have another meaning. I really can't understand how Dave Matthews Band can have its music so complex and pop at the same time. And they're going on and on... If I could make a music 1/100 as good as one of DMB, I could die a happy man. The whole album is great, but Rapunzel, Stay and Crush are breathtaking!!"
4,Different,"Its obvious with this CD that DMB is trying to take a different approach to their music, and it doesn't always work too well. Songs like ""Stay,"" ""Crush,"" and ""Rapunzel"" have that familiar DMB sound, but many of the other songs on the CD are just wierd. Especially the guest voice of Alanis Morisette. The old DMB would have never done this. The new version of ""Halloween"" is far insuperior to the old and familiar version, and many of the techno sound effects thrown into the end of songs are annoying. Having people mumbling and phones ringing at the end of a song does nothing to add to the enjoyment of it.Many of the songs may grow on the listener, but don't expect to hear audiences shouting for them to play many of these songs at concerts. They're just not that good."
5,"Thank You Dave, Carter, Leroi, Stefan, and Boyd","What can I say? Other than ""Thank You"" to the nicest, friendliest, most selfless, and talented musicians that ever graced the presence of music fans everywhere.(Read Fanfare and you'll see what I mean). Also, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ALBUMN COMING HOPEFULLY IN NOVEMBER! From what I've heard on this tour, expect this to be the best albumn yet. (And that's not just BS because I'm a hardcore fan...I really mean it) Look for amazing songs like ""Captain"", ""Grey Street"", and ""Grace is Gone"" (my personal fav so far) Wow, we are truly lucky to have this amazing band. (Oh and by the way, Before These Crowded Streets is awesome...just thought I'd post SOMETHING relevant to this topic hehe)"
5,DMB-Still good,"The Dave Matthews Band continues to produce great music. Before These Crowded Streets is one of DMB's best albums. On this album the sound is different from their previous album: Crash. This album has tracks that are all unique, and they go from the seductive ""Crush"" to the wild ""Halloween."" This record is the kind of music that you can listen to straight through and enjoy every minute of it. Trust me when I say, they are just as good, if not better, live when compared with their studio recordings."
2,What happened?,"some songs are ok, but it doesnt even come close to earlier cds. the band was doing fine before this. What happened?"
2,Dave Matthews needs to take time off.,"Dave Matthews is beginning to sell out. As a long time listener, I remember the days that Dave Matthews concerts weren't filled with wanna-be's. Lately, Dave Matthews has not appealed to me, especially this album, because of the Jackson Browne effect(all the songs are starting to sound the same). As I am putting down DMB, I am wishing to make a point: Dave Matthews needs to take time off for a while, and come up with new music, badly."
3,A rushed less-than-best showing,"Let me start with saying that I love DMB. I Love this CD also. But as far as Dave goes, he could have done better. They sat in a large number of musicians on this one. Bela Fleck(banjo), Tim Reynolds(electric and acoustic guitar), Kronos Quartet(string ensamble), and Alanis Morissette(back-up vocals). These musicians muddied up the traditional Dave sound. I reccomend to you the consumer, buy Under the Table and Dreaming first. If you fall in love with DMB's sound, than this album will be a nice twist."
3,not as good as I hoped...,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE dave matthews band. I'd have to say however, that I'm a greater fan of the older work as well as the live show. I love songs from from Under The Table and Dreaming, Crash, and even older stuff, and my favorite DMB songs continue continue to be ""Ants..."" and ""Dancing..."". When I first heard ""Don't Drink the Water"" it didn't sound like the old dave, and I was kind of upset. Despite my disappointment with this album, I will continue my support of the band."
2,As a huge DMB fan I am a little disappointed,"I love DMB, but Before These Crowded Streets really diappointed me. It just doesn't have the beat the other C.D.'s do. It doesn't sound like the Dave I love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Brings out some of the best and some of the not to great.,"This CD has music that is unlike any other Dave Matthews CDs. It has some songs like ""The Last Stop"" which has sort of an Egyptian twist to it. Songs like ""Rapunzel"" and ""Don't Drink the Water"" are some of the best DMB songs ever. Songs like ""Spoon"" don't show the DMB gift. All the other songs are better than your average songs but are not great."
2,Not as good as his old music,"I think dave matthews has sold out with this album. I love their old stuff and esepcially in concert, but i am not into small bands because oi thinkg dave has stooped to an all time low with this cd"
2,It's okay if you really like search and find,"Personally, I don't like search and find, but it was okay to play once. For each scene, you get a list of items to search for, and then you have to find a certain percent of them to pass the level. Since every level is like this, it seemed pretty repetitive to me.I consider myself to have a pretty good vocabulary, but it's always difficult when you're asked to search for something that you don't even know what it is, as some of the search items were a bit obscure.The plot was also pretty cheesy, as everytime you're searching for something, it's because something awful is going on that will ruin the wedding, and if you win, then you will save the day.After you win, you get to pick different items for the wedding, which I did think was fun. Overall, I thought it was alright to play once, but I wouldn't recommend it and definitely would only play once."
4,Fun to play,This game is fun for both adults and kids. My granddaughters never get tired of it. It's long enough to last for many hours as well.
4,moonjar review,"I have been looking for the perfect bank for my 6 year old son who is very interested in learning about money. I think this bank is perfect! the 3 compartments are just the right size, and i love how they stay together. however, you must keep a constant eye on the rubber band that secures them. it easy to misplace. my only suggestion for this bank is to include an extra band or make the compartments permanently locked together. other than that, we love it. it has definitely helped teach and promote responsible money habits."
4,great item,"This is a great item for teaching children about money. My daughter still puts way too much in the ""spend"" section as opposed to the other two, but she's learning! I just wish the sections were a little bigger. It doesn't hold as much as I'd like it to hold..."
5,Good purchase,This is exactly as expected. Useful tool to teach kids how to save and spend. I would highly recommend this item.
2,so so,"Beautifully shot, with an interesting story. But there's really not a whole lot TO the story, really, and it is rather slow. And while Diane Keaton hasn't aged a day since this film was made, Gibson now looks a million years older than in this movie! Just shows what chain smoking can do to your skin!! END"
3,Ordered the wrong shelf by mistake.,"I ordered this shelf mistakenly because I was given the wrong rack dimensions. But I can still say the quality is quite good. Plus, it's steel. I highly doubt there would be any issues of it meeting its load-bearing rating."
1,Does not work!,"THIS IS MY OPINION ONLY! Free Cash Flow Security Analysis as outlined, described and practiced according to this book is not a practical methodology to make money in the real world of the current stock market. In the current stock market environment it simply does not work! Valuation of stocks must be relative to the company's growth rate of free cash flow AND REPORTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. Also, debt analysis is not a worthwhile endeavor in the current market environment. THIS IS MY OPINION ONLY!"
1,Terrible Book - I lost Money!,I lost money following the investment advice in this book - DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
1,I've made 33% a year by buying growth stocks!,I buy growth stocks - not small to mid-cap deep value basic industry cyclicals. Buy Growth not Value! FREE CASH FLOW ANALYSIS DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE!
1,Looks and styling is great but Comfort..NONE !!,Don't buy this show. They look great and they are sturdy but they are not comfortable. In fact they bite you so bad. Bad choice !
4,Very Nice!,"I was very impressed with the 12"" Delta benchtop drill press. The 12"" handles everything I need it for and also has an impressive number of accessory toys available to upgrade it (mortising attachement, etc.). It weighs a ton so I would highly recommend finding a place for it and mounting it there--it's not a lot of fun to try and move around. As for the lamp accessory--it's worthless. That's why I rated it a 4 versus a 5. It attaches with a magnet...and then it slides down and falls off. Overall, I would recommend this product without reservation. Just supply your own light."
2,"really disappointed, but only ($$$)","based on the reviews, there seems to be two completely different schools of thought on this product. My vote goes with ""junk"". Everything is very loose, the chuck is not true, so it turns in an eliptical motion (instead of a circle) and while I haven't had problems with the chuck falling off, the method of installation called for in the instructions ""pound it in with a rubber mallet"" --seriously!-- makes me certain it is only a matter of time. Also, you have to tighten the chuck with the key extremely hard and the bits still slip nearly every time."
4,You better check your manual,"I am impressed with this drill press. I think it operates very well. It is quite and smooth during operation. I agree with one review that the light is a good idea, but it slides and won't stay in place. The others that commented and said that everything is loose, ""You better check your manual"" you must have done something wrong."
3,Great for opening beer cans...,"Actually,I don't use it for that.1.The chuck has fell off twice.2.It's noisy for a press.3.Good torque.4.Easy to adjust.5.Tends to vibrate to much.6.Nice and heavy.Won't have to worry about your teen walking off with this tool."
4,Good value for the money,"I purchased this machine about 3 months ago...I have used the drill press for making holes as well as sanding with various size drums on many types of wood. The machine has worked very well on all occasions and I am very pleaased with its operations.The only two draw backs are 1.) the need to use the chuck to get the bit either tightened or loosened from start to finish, can't use my hand to get most of the way there and do the final tightening with the chuck and 2.) the finish isn't very good. I know the finish does not affect the overall performance, but sends a negative message about the factory's pride in workmanship.All said, I would buy this machine again as I think its cost and performance match up well."
2,Buy tickets to see him instead.,"Another disappointing album from Cliff. When you see him perform live, just him and his guitar, he blows you away. Absolutely, you leave feeling like you have just seen one of the most talented singer songwriters of your lifetime. But he fails to capture that intensity in the studio. The albums are over produced, flat and lifeless. This one especially. Until he releases a raw live intimate recording, don't waste your money on his cd's. See him live instead."
5,clever coupling with excellent performances,"This cleverly coupled disc presents two excellent performances in superb sound. Byron Janis's steely and impassioned pianism perfectly portrays the drama and atmosphere of Moussorgsky's colourful composition. He is able to negotiate the technical demands of the work with great ease. Fine as the hallowed 1959 Richter/Sofia live performance might be, it has a number of wrong notes and is poorly recorded with a noisy audience. I much prefer the Janis version for everyday listening; the Mercury sound is wide ranging and realistic.The Dorati performance, given a lesser billing, is equally recommendable. Terrific sound, orchestral playing and a lively interpretation. It sit comfortably with the best versions of the orchestral version. If this coupling appeals to you, buy it."
3,somewhat dissappaointed,There are many cuts and the theme is repeated throughout. It's a bit long and repetitive. It starts out with the paino and at the end it's full orchestra.
3,Good book in total but frustrating characters,"Kate's writing style is elegant and professional and the characters she has created are very intriguing. If I have any criticism, its the character of Liath. She obviously has a great deal of inner strength and will, has held her own in some brutal physical battles and yet suffers the ""deer-in-headlights"" syndrome whenever Hugh is around."
3,Don't give up now,"Not as strong as the first book but still a good read and entracing at some points. A lot of new characters are introduced that may seem irrelevant at this time but you will meet again. With the introduction of more characters it is a little harder to follow but bare with it. It's very much a storyline that links to other areas further down the track. still an enjoyable read, don't give up here there's still a long way to go."
4,Varied and satisfying,"I took this on a trip, thinking I'd abandon it at the other end, but it was too good, so I had to bring it home!It's a somewhat melodramatic plot done with grace and style, interesting characters, flavorful writing and nice alternate medieval history. I enjoyed reading it -- defintely a good way to live through a terrible plane ride."
5,Thoughtful and Engrossing,"Although many have criticized Elliott's adaptation of ""real"" history into her own world, I think that it is the countless details she has added that make _A Prince of Dogs_ worth reading. I'm not talking just historical odds and ends, but also the plot twists that crop up maybe on second or third reading, the complex web of magic that stretches across the entire world, and the characters that seem more and more real with each chapter.It is clear that this is one author that has done careful research not only into the events, but also into the context in which historical material from our world could be fitted into hers. But research aside, her writing is some of the most compelling that I have come across in years. I am impressed by the amount and quality of work that Kate Elliott has produced, and desperately wish to see more of Liath, Alain, and Sanglant!"
2,totally unconvincing,"Considering the concept and ingredients the story sounded promising. But I'm afraid it was not. The story line was very predictable, no surprises, despite the occasional hinting at deeper hidden meanings. It is an admirable attempt to grasp the reader's attention through hundreds of pages with promises of a deeper layer, but alas so far no more than 2-dimensional, flat, stereotyped characters whom I could not care less about. I mean if you want to change history (religion that is) and put women on top of religious hierarchy, I think the author missed a great opportunity here to actually do something with such a different concept. Wouldn't it have been much more logical that with that in mind religious history would have taken a quite different path? It is just not convincing, and after yet another lesson in biblical paraphrasing you just get bored and toss it aside."
1,"Aptly named, it's a Dog!","If you like your heroines wimpy and heavy into masochism, this book's for you. Not since the days of the B-westerns and the helpless heroine who never raises her hand to help the hero but only to clasp those hands futilely together, has there been a more helpless, useless heroine as Kate Elliott has drudged up...and I do mean drudged! As for her hero? He's chained to a throne and surrounded by vicious dogs for most of the near endless book, so not much action nor heroics there either. Skip this volume and go directly to the next, you won't have missed anything."
5,Absolutely terrific,"King Henry's bastard son Sanglant is considered dead by most residents of the Kingdoms of Wendar and Varre. However, the PRINC OF DOGS is actually alive, held prisoner by the Eika, Bloodheart. Sanglant, who is immortal, finds his last vestiges of sanity slipping away during his unwelcome stay as the guest of the warlord. The reported death of his son has shook King Henry, who is completing his victory over several rebel lords before engaging in the ultimate battle with Bloodheart.PRINCE OF DOGS, The second novel in ""Crown Of Stars"" series, is an action-packed, exciting other world fantasy novel that works because the characters seem so real. Like its predecessor, KING'S DRAGON, (which is coming out in paperback), the captivating story line holds reader attention throughout the novel. Fans of the fantasy genre need to read the two volumes of this well written series for a taste of a realistic fantasy adventure.Harriet Klausner"
3,Twisting away,"epic fantasy is a very dangerous market, and Kate Elliott is navigating a very different road. Taking the similar paths to other authors (Martin, Jordan), she begins to layer on the multiple character viewpoints as her story gets more complicated. Unlike the first novel, this one begs you to go on with the series and hopes that the author has an arc which can be completed (unlike a certain other author).This novel begins to knit characters closer together (Liath & Alain, Liath & Sanglant) while pulling others apart (Liath & Hanna, Hanna & Ivan). The king appears to be the capable leader in one moment, while showing weakness and uncertainty the next. The few problems I had are the events that seem to have no importance at this time (the Seven Sleepers) while being given enough weight that you know it will be important later. You just can't tell how."
5,Angels among us is a good thought,I have always loved that song but just recently thought to look for it on Amazon. I'm enjoying all the other selections with Angels in the titles.
1,Do NOT Waste Your Time and Money,"This movie was bad from the beginning all the way through to the end. I feel insulted and ashamed for watching all of it. Please don't make the same mistake I did by thinking it must be good because of the cast. It just isn't true. The story line is implausible, the dialogue is juvenile, and the production is very poor.I normally don't write reviews, but if one person skips this movie after reading this one, then my job is well done."
5,Soldiers of Fortune,Very well acted for a low budget movie. This film did have a lot of good acting and a pretty decent script. Good action.
3,Worth a look for the right person.,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Soldiers of Fortune"" (An Action DVD review)...pretty good.Become a fan of ""The Lowedown"" on Facebook...Genre: 6.5 Movie: 4.5What's it about?Wealthy thrill-seekers pay huge premiums to have themselves inserted into military adventures, only this time things don't go exactly to plan.What did I think?I came into this not expecting anything but a low budget action movie...and that's pretty much what I got. I did like the cast and the concept, but there were too many subplots that the movie didn't need..not everyone needs an ulterior motive here, guys. If you are a Christian Slater fan (are there any left?) or will watch anything action...it's worth renting or buying for under $5."
4,B action movie,"""Soldiers of Fortune"" is an average action movie. I felt it would of been better with a different lead actor. I've felt Slater isn't well suited for military action movies. I think its because he is trying to act like a tough guy and usually can't pull it off. Although his knife fighting is pretty good in this movie so maybe there is hope for him yet.Also on a side note, there is no romance in this movie. I point this out because its rare not to have any romance in every piece of modern media. I wouldn't mind except marketing is usually the reason for including pointless romances into a storyline."
2,There was nothing else at the time,"Well, definitely a B movie, I picked it because I did not see anything else at the time. Volume for speaking roles was very weak and I did not care for the ending. This film is not worth the rental price. You will not be missing anything. Christian Slater is a good actor along with the other big names in the film, but this film did not do anything for them..it was the script I believe that just did not work for them at all."
5,Dust control in a small or big shop,"My shop consist of a one car garage and I do alot of Bandsaw projects. The amount of sawdust produced by a Bandsaw is enormous and with very little air circulation this poses a health hazard. This dust collector takes care of this problem. Its ease of mobility to go from one machine to another has keeped sawdust to a minimum with very little to clean up at the end of a day, also making it easy to store. This unit does get warm but not hot and has not tripped any breakers during long operating periods. It is rated at 80db but because of the size of my shop is seem alittle louder than that. I had this unit running in about five minutes out of the box and have been pleased with its perfomance."
1,Q:Who Buys all these darn Star Trek books?,"A:*true believers*I mean now even the Klingons are the featured players in a book! What's next the bar tender on DS9 gets his own line of novels? Trek isn't even that popular anymore, people!!!!"
3,"Engaging, but loud","Good toy for creative play, but the sounds and music are kind of loud. Even though I put tape over the speaker area, it still seems loud. Nevertheless, my 2 year old loves it and played with it for 4 hours straight yesterday. Minor problems: The door can be a slight problem (little hands can get caught going back in) and the dog looks kind of like a cat/kangaroo/rat. It's also not very portable. There's no way to keep all the pieces contained if you or your child wants to move it."
2,Not as indepth as advertised,"I was disappointed in the lack of discussion on each individual book of the Old Testament. The write up on it led me to think it would be more in-depth. It was advertised as ""... serviceable for college and seminary use as well as for study by scholars, pastors, and interested lay readers."" That is definitely too many bases to cover! If you know nothing about the Old Testament, buy it. If you're looking for information to supplement a Bible study beyond a cursory reading of scripture, find another book."
3,Still reading...,Still reading... Sometimes hard to follow... But some great sermon notes. I love history so I'm enjoying reading the material.
1,"If you believe the Bible is literally truth, don't get this book","In a nutshell, this book has a very liberal outlook on the creation of the Old Testament. It advocates the JEDP and similar theories, and frequently questions if things described in the Bible actually happened.If you don't agree with that, then you know why I gave the book 1 star. I suppose if you DO follow those ides, you'll like the book at lot more."
1,utter shite!,"another crummy book by ray donato...this book has no solos,incorrect transcriptions,wrong keys,etc,etc,etcanybody wanting to actually learn one of these songs are looking in the wrong place...for me i picked this up to add to my collection so luckily it wasnt the case that i was learning the tunes but if i was id be writing hate mail to donato..do not spend more than 3 bux for this book...its barely worth that...no complaints to seller who i bought it from cause the price was fair...thanx 4 that..:)"
5,this book grabs baby's attention,"Star, little star introduces babies to barnyard and domestic animals, as well as, other wildlife. The cut out star gets smaller and smaller on each page and can be used to regain babies attention by poking fingers through. It reads like a poem, the illustrations are adorable and I need a few more copies."
4,Not as pictured,"Nice little system don't expect it to come with, white Delta bottom bag shown in picture...... instead expect 2 ... plastic bags.....what a way to cut corners....other wise does a nice job...... plastic Bag is impossible to seal, what a shame have to duct tape it right out of the box......."
1,delta 50-850 dust collector,"Very disappointing performance; I purchased this collector as a direct replacement for a Shopsmith collector rated at 330 cfm because I wanted improved performance. It's connected to a 20 foot long 4 inch diameter PVC manifold with long radius taps along its length with only one connected at a time.Because the Delta 50-850 is rated at 1200 cfm I expected better; it doesn't even inflate the upper bag fully. I called Delta Service and was informed that Delta rates their unit as a bare blower only-no intake pipe or bag! Further, I was told that I was foolish to expect good performance unless used with only one woodworking machine (which I do) and with a hose length of 6 feet or less (which I don't). Perhaps I am supposed to be happy with the extra noise it provides rather than better sawdust collection than the Shopsmith 330. I would not recommend my...mistake to others."
3,assembly not so easy,"At first glance this dust collector appears to be a fine unit. However, assembly is not so easy. The motor is mounted to a base which has flanges at the bottom. The motor base is bolted to a roll-around platform via the flanges, but this step is near impossible as the flanges are bent up at a 45 degree angle. A sure sign of poor quality control. The flanges must be made flat by the owner before the unit can be assembled.The good thing about this unit is that it can be easily rewired for 220 volt operation.One word of caution -- do not lean over the fan when turning the unit on. I accidently picked up a nail in the inlet hose, and it pierced the fan discharge hose."
1,It's Silent,"I bought this dust collector in November. It's now mid-January, and I have not yet used it. When first tested, it promptly blew four 20 amp slow blow fuses in succession, on a circuit that I have used for many, more powerful tools. I took it to a Delta repair shop. After five weeks, I got it back with a new motor, at no cost. It still blows fuses. I called Delta's ""hot line"", and was told that a 20 amp circuit is not enough. They recommend 30 amps, or re-wire it for 220 volts. I think I now know why it won't start. The impeller (fan) is a massive thing, rather crudely rivited together from heavy sheet steel. It has so much inertia that the motor can't get up to speed before the fuse blows. Aside from the motor loading, I question the use of steel in a fan that would be expected to handle wood dust and metal particles, due to the potential for creating sparks/explosions."
3,What A Good Review?,I have read the reviews and must agree that some of these reports seem to be a little novel (IN BOTH SENSE). GO to Google groups if you real reviews.Bill B
4,Very nice medium price dust collector,"I've had one of these for about a year now. It works well, although you do want to wear hearing protection around it. Delta was shipping 30 micron bags with it when I bought it and I immediately sold those and bought 5 micron bags. (Delta should be ashamed to give you 30 micron bags with this thing. If they are giving buyers 5 micron bags now, I raise my rating to 5 stars.)Also, while it may kind of work on a 120 v/15 amp circuit, you are much better off wiring it as 220 v. No more circuit breaker popping then."
4,Delta 50-850 Dust Collector.,"This year, Santa (bless her heart) brought me the above dust collector. Once I got it going in my shop, I really liked it. Quiet, powerful, and did an excellent job for two days before the motor burned-up. No problem, I took the motor assembly back to the place of purchase, and it was replaced.....no questions asked. The only complaints I have about this system pertains to the dust bags. Going to five micron bags on the part of the manufacturer should not be an after thought, and second; who's idea was it to leave one dollar's worth elastic banding out of the bottom bag anyway? This leaves me to assume that the unit is probably built in Taiwan by personnel that have never used one in a shop. If it is built in the good old USA, then that Design Engineer, Mr Tightwad, should be soundly spanked!"
3,An OK CD,"I love Marion Williams, and I have a lot of her music. But I was a little shocked at this CD, It does not have a lot of real nice songs. It is Ok. But I have other music that was made by her that is 'OUTSTANDING' I mean some sincere sung from the heart music singing all about our great God.She is a overall great gospel singer, and I have truly enjoyed her music over the years. But I was just not very pleased with this CD. I would say it is about 3-great songs that I loved on this CD. But make no mistake about it, She can sing some good gospel."
5,COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN,"This was one of the best books I have ever read!As soon as I started reading it, I did not want to put it down. It was full of action and suspence. I took it to work and passed it around to several of my friends. Everybody that read it really liked it. Can't wait to see the movie. Liddy did it again."
5,"Certainly superior to Tom Clancy, et al.","My guess is that most people will encounter this book because they are already fans of Mr. Liddy's syndicated radio program, or because they have already read WILL and are hungry for more Liddyesque material. This book will not disappoint (unless you expect WAR AND PEACE - or another WILL); I read it shortly after it was first released and I still remember the plot, action, and characters vividly: how many ""techno-thrillers"" can that be said about? I actually take issue with the label of ""techno-thriller"": MONKEY HANDLERS is about the men of the Navy SEALs, more particularly about how the human mind, body, and spirit can combine to produce results previously unimagined. It's a very good book and a good companion on an airliner or by the pool."
2,Really disappointed,"I wasn't as enthusiastic about this book as the writers of the other reviews were. I found the characters stereotypical and the writing somewhat clumsy in parts, especially in the dialogue passages (for example, the New York accents of certain characters just didn't sound real). However, what seemed most preposterous is the idea that a car going south at 90 miles per hour has a difficult time keeping up with a ship traveling down the Hudson River. It brings to mind Boris Karloff as the Mummy dragging his feet yet perpetually just behind the person who is sprinting away."
3,Bad subtitles...,"The anime was excellent, and I finally got to see the entire mini-series. However, the english subtitles were some of the worst I have ever seen. Character names changed, not just from episode to episode, but sometimes from scene to scene. The subs often mashed the lines of two characters together. Much of the story line was lost due to poor translation.I know there is another version out there that has a clean translation. You can tell it by the white subs versus the yellow of this version. The one with the white subs is translated neatly and makes perfect sense.I would recommend that the retailers with this version cease doing business with their supplier on this particular item, and discount any remaining stock to compensate the buyers for the poor translation."
5,The start of an era,This is a fantastic story set a year before the events in Macross city which would change the Earth forever in this story we follow Shin a young pilot with the UN Forces who gets shot down by a mysterious plane that chages into a flying robot which begin the chain of events which will lead us into the end of the unification wars and the start of a legend the story here is great and the animation is top notch plus we get to see Roy Fokker kick butt what else could you want .
2,Slow and Bad,"It can only burn at 1x-2x that used with RecordNow and at 2x-4x with Nero6. And I have also found 6 bad disks so far after 12 attemps in which 4 of those I can physically see the scratches and purple spots hidden behind the surface. the reasons i gave it 2 stars because of its price and spindle box instead of in cup cake oem version like other online sellers. Honestly, I've been sucessfully burned with 4x with very low % disk failure with Ritek before where I got them as an oem cupcake version. And don't get me wrong 'cause I could be an unlucky one with this spindle..."
3,Not burning at 4X speed,I'm a bit upset that it only can be burned at 2.4X speed. The label says 4X. All other brands that I have bought are able to burn at 4X except Ridata. But the price was right.....
1,ridata is just plain poor quality media,"I ordered ridata 4x dvd-rw and ridata 4x dvd-r, and im dead serious when I say both batches of discs were corrupt. However crazy that is, the quality of ridata labeled media is the same as the garbage you bring outside. I have a pioneer a05 and the discs are not even recognized by any software in the drive. When I burned the 4x dvd-r discs, I had like 4 out of 5 coasters. Ritek used to make quality and affordable media, but this ridata labeled media is just plain junk, avoid it. Look at every else reviews, its no secret that you shouldnt buy this stuff."
5,I love justiN chriS joeY LansteN jC,"hey you peeps who say they are copying bsb you are soooo wrong they are being there selves. If you say that *Nsync copied BSB,then that mean that BSB copied NKOTB.It's sad ,but true.The only ones they are copying off of BSb are 5ive. *Nsync sound nothing like BSB. And finally all you guys who think they suck are Just popular cause you cannot girl and all the girls at your school likes them instead of you STAY *NSYNc"
1,"A ""great"" CD by *N Stync","*N Sync is just riding on the boy band wave and just cashing in on it. They have no real talent, and only do what they think will make them the most money. They all act like they're three years old, and I hate this CD."
1,A DISGRACE TO REAL MUSIC.,"Look at what we have here,the backstreet boys cloned by a greedy balding man.Its boy bands like nsync which has polluted mtv and all of commercial music.Their debut cd is as unoriginal and fake as a weave.All the songs are boring and it sounds like they are trying too hard to impress their naive teenage fans.This is a band that is only based on image and not on real talent.Their label is brainwashing people who have no true musical sense to believe that they are a great band.People we need to make it stop already because mtv will keep spewing garbage like this until something is done about it.DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!!!"
1,100% Pure Sugar,"I still can't believe this is #59 on the list of the greatest albums of the millenium. Do the people who voted for it actually think this sugar-coated sh*t even DESERVES to be on that list? There are hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of albums better than this. Lots of talented musicians have put huge amounts of effort into making masterpieces that will last for eons. This took about as much energy as a flea's fart. Ten years from now, N'Sync will be as forgotten as any of the other candy-coated pop groups of today. If you're considering buying this, do yourself a favour and browse around Amazon: take a look at the essentials list, look at some recommended CDs, and check those out. Believe me, you'll thank me later. This stuff is worse than elevator muzak from hell."
5,'N SYNC maniac,"This CD has great songs. I especially like I Want You Back, Tearin Up My Hearts, Here We Go, God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You. All the songs lifts my spirits and gives me a high feeling because the boys are so good looking. And, wow, the way they dance! I love watching them dance on videos. Justin is my favorite. The music is not bubblegum music. A lot of us older middle aged people enjoy 'N SYNC."
5,This is one of my fav Cd's!!!,"When I first heard the song ""I Want You Back"" I knew I had to have the Cd, but waited until their second single ""Tearing Up My Heart"" came out to get it. And it was well worth it. I just love the all the music on the Cd and could never get sick of it. The enhanced Cd makes it even better. They have a sample of the vidio ""I Want You Back"" and much more. One more thing, 'N Sync is in no way a copy of BSB. Though the two groups both have talent and looks thats where the similarities end. If you're planning on buying this Cd because you want another Cd like BSB I suggest you don't buy this Cd, because 'N Sync's style is way different than BSB. I am not dissing BSB in any way, I just am sick of people saying 'N Sync is a copy of them. Thank You."
5,I like it!,"This was my first ever cd. I can not get enough of it! Unfortunately I lost the cd accidently, through a series of house moving. I miss it greatly. If you buy this I guarentee, you will not be dissapointed(...)"
1,Can you say bubble gum? I knew you could,"I don't see why everyone likes *N Sync. They are just money-hungry guys who act like they're 3 years old, even though Chris is fricking 28 years old. All their songs fit a mold of bubble gum. I've heard their single off their second album, and it just sounds like the same old thing. If they want to stay in the business, they better be able to appeal to more than 8 year old girls. A little writing on their next album wouldn't hurt either."
1,does not derserve any stars,they are so formulaic and artificial it makes the village people seem like the beatles in comparison.not for anyone over 15 or people with taste
1,boy bands,"i think nsync is trash. they have no talent, they sound exactly like the other stupid boy bands and who are also in it just for the money. no one should waste their time on stupid boy bands. they're all fake and are just in it for the money. listen to music that isn't fake and that doesn't sound like the same damn boy bands. now we can all lable all the ""boy band"" fans as ""teenies""... don't be put in the spot. don't waste a minute with these bands."
1,Can you say horrible?,"This C.D. is very, very, very, very, very, very BBBBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDD. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage. You will regret it very soon."
1,OH MY GOD!!!!!!!,"I absolutly CAN NOT STAND THIS CD!! It makes me gag!!! Seriosly, words can NOT say how much I hate these BSB wannabes!!!! I've read all the reviews about N'sync( except for the one that say that they love them)and I totally agree with everybody that thinks that they are the most untalented group in the world.( I hope you reilize that it's really hard for me to even say OR write love in the same sentence as ""you know who""). Lets just make this short. They can't sing, they can't dance, and they are the ugliest group of guys I've ever seen!!!! They make Hanson look good!!!!! BSB are much more talented!!! And who in the world would put their hair in black and white dreadlocks in pigtails??!!!!! That other guy, Justin or whatever, his hair looks like brains! I guess since he doesn't have any inside that he decided to put some on the outside himself. Well, I guess that's all I have to say, or not?"
1,the only thing we need is another boy band!,"i am getting so sick of boy bands like n'sync. my little sister has this album and she overplays it all the time. i am sick of hearing ""hear we go"" and ""tearin up my heart"". i don't know why amazon did not put up my last review (maybe i was too nasty). all i listen to is my the new KoRn CD ""issues"" which is not bad. also Sevendust ""Home"" and Coal Chamber ""Chamber Music"". first try listening to this bad album and then the albums i told you. you will be so relieved of that boy band stuff. Heavy Metal Forever!"
2,What is with all the BoyBands?,These songs have no feeling unless you want to feel the rhythm to dance to them. Thanks but no thanks. I prefer bands that actually play their own instuments.
2,The Kobayashi Review,"Not my favorite CD, but I think its work having... I don't remember when I got this. I think I've had it since I was a kid."
1,they don't even have the sex appeal right!,"this group doesn't even need the name ""nsync"". why not just change it to what they really are - Backstreet clones? And yet, they are not exactly backstreet clones. more like...hmm, how can I put this nicely? extremely pathetic clones of backstreet? that's more like it. These guys have voices that sound as if they all have permanent sharp pains in you-know-where. you might not like the Backstreet Boys but you gotta admit that they're better than this bunch of pathetic losers"
1,whatever,"I suppose some of the songz were good. But I come to the conclusion that these guys don't have much talent. They don't write any of their songs(oh, sorry, I forgot giddy up was a song! puh leeze!) And well, I sorry, even their voices suck. Even the Backstreet boys have better voices(actually, their voices ae decent, and no, I'm not a bsb fan) I guess, all i have to say is, lou pearlman, have a problem! He has a factory down there of making boybandz. byet"
2,N Sync's sound,"After hearing ""I Drive Myself Crazy"" I picked up a copy of N Sync's album. Unfortunately, I wasn't so impressed. Most songs not released to the radio were re-makes of oldies. They didn't have the maturity in their sound that I thought they'd have. This was quite a disappointment. Hopefully their next album will be an improvement."
5,*NSync is my #1 choice cd!,"I totally LOVED this album, to say the least! It has a fantastic mixture of music. I disagree with the comment that NSync is just like the BSB, however. In my opinion, this cd is more harmonious and more of a mix of different kinds of music than the BSB (I own both cds). Nsync also shows their true personalities and they just like having fun and living life to the fullest, something we can all relate to. This cd is DEFINITELY a must for any NSync fan (or soon to be fan). I could not live without it when I started liking this talented group! P.S. You will fall in love with ""God Must Have Spent...""!!"
5,NSYNC RULES!,"This is the next hot group of five guys. Although some people say they're not as good as Backstreet Boys they're just as good. They have wonderful songs that are jam packed with harmony and great sounds. My favorite song is ""I Drive Myself Crazy"" People also say that they can't dance like the Backstreet Boys, well that's not true either. Both groups are really good dancers and have different sounds to them. Both groups are wonderful and I like both of them the same. So, why do we have to choose who is better?"
5,The best music group ever!,"'N Sync is not only some of the best singers and harmonizers ever, they've also got great personalities, great morals, and they're very good-looking! I see them staying around for a long time...and I can't wait for their next album!"
3,NORMAL TEEN POP WITH A TWIST,Nsync is normal teen pop with a twist. They can simg really great ballads such as I Drive myself Crazy and (God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You. Otherwise there all the same as other teen pop groups such as Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees and that is not good.
4,Pretty good!,"This is N'Sync... Yes it is... This is a musthave album. Best songs are ""You Got It"", ""Here We Go"", and ""Tearin' Up My Heart"". You might want to skip No Strings Attached and buy this one."
1,Horrible!!!!!,"Wow! This is about the worst cd in the whole entire world! I can't believe everyone out there who likes them. I hate to admit it but they come really close to Hanson at the bottom of my list, in fact I think they are below Hanson! Go buy some real music guys!"
3,for a first cd it's good,"I think that for a first cd this was pretty good, and I'm looking forward to the next release. I think that it could have been better, and reached into more genres, but all in all it wasn't too bad."
1,"If only there was a ""0"" star rating","This is true trash. Give it another year and this one will be selling for 25 cents in every garage sale across the nation. ""Flavor of the month"" does not even begin to describe this sort of excuse for music. It is so simple that my 2 year old can relate, and he looses the plot on cartoons. The lyrics are canned from a production script, and I have a sneeking suspision that the music is really rehashed MIDI loops from some record company's lick-and-stick library. I have to question any band who specifically targets the 10 year old market. This stuff is the dietary equivelant to orange juice - it does little and goes right out. If you want this type of music, save your money and simply listen to the hit radio stations - they only play today what will be gone tomorrow."
5,I LOVE N'SYNC,"I LOVE N'SYNC SINCE THERE TV CONCERT. I LOVE JUSTIN SO MUCH HE IS THE BEST EVER, THE BAND ROCK I LOVE THEM SO MUCH"
3,It's okay,"Like all those other bands out there, they are yet another one of them. 5 white guys singing. Their voices are okay and I appreciate the charity things they have done but still... Is this just another band of 5 guys who are trying to be famous? They are so similar in views like the BSB. With songs that almost imitations, all born in the same state (coincidence?), they are all 5 guys, and have fans that are practically all girls. Sounds familiar?"
1,NOTHING SPECTACULAR,IVE LISTENED TO BETTER. IF POP IS HEADING IN THIS DIRECTION WITH BANDS LIKE BACKSTREET BOYS AND N-SYNC. IT IS VERY SAD AND DISSAPOINTING.
5,JOEY AND CHRIS ARE HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"SORRY JUSTIN AND LANCE BUT BLONDES AND BLUE EYES ARE NOT MY TYPE! WHEN I HEARD THIS CD I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST ANOTHER HANSON. BUT THEN I REALLY LISTENED TO IT AND IT WAS GOOD. AND THAT IS STRANGE BECAUSE I LIKE BANDS LIKE ROB ZOMBIE, MANSON, SMASHING PUMKINS AND ETC... I CAN REALLY RELETE TO MANY OF THE SONGS AND CHRIS AND JOEY ARE HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EMAIL ME IF U AGREE"
5,The best cd ever,"I love this cd its the best one i own they are all really talented people. I espacially am 'n' love with Justin, he is so hot! And all of you peoples who think this is just another stupid pop band well I think you need to learn what real music is. What do you listen to that Korn stuff and stuff like that. Well anyway buy the album its Hot espacially the guys on the cover. I LOVE YOU JUSTIN!!"
3,"Yes, they're vocally talented, but the CD isn't strong.","I'm sorry to say to all fans out there that *N SYNC is just another pop boy band with the same flavor of music as the Backstreet Boys, although somewhat funkier and less serious. They harmonize very well (much better than BSB) and are obviously very talented performers, and although I enjoyed their songs more than BSB's, there's just not enough variety in the CD. There's nothing that makes them stand out from the stereotypes."
5,NSync is my favorite group and I love their music!,"Unlike most groups, NSync has a unique aspect of music. Their music is soothing, but also has some adrenaline rushing songs. They have harmony, which also makes their music worth listening to. I am often very critical of music, but these boys have got it made! I am looking forward to hearing more of their new songs in the future. They are my favorite group. They ""have the skills to keep this party pumpin' baby!"""
2,Pretty Disapointing,"I bought this CD with my own money, then listened to it, and decided I should have bought a different CD. N Sync is just another cheesy pop boy band, that can only sell records by their looks. Yes, they can sing well, but most of the tracks on the CD sound like a dance song gone bad. I'll admit that they 3 radio singles, (I Want You Back, Tearin' Up My Heart, and God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You) are quality songs, but what dissapoints me most, is that you don't get any more of those quality songs, except for ""Sailing"". That song shows their vocal talent, and their ability to harmorzie with each other. Other than those 4 tracks, the CD is a waste of your hard earned money basically because the rest of the tracks sound very similar. I feel that the CD wanted to be a dance CD, but just didn't make it."
1,YUK!! Way too materialistic! Not enough intelligence!!,"YYYYYYUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!! These guys know how to bait their hook, that's for sure! It seems to me that they're only interested in fame, money, and being teen idols!!!"
1,"more sappy,crappy,stupid pop from more untalented popsters","sorry,but anyone over the age of 12 who enjoys this crap has bad brain damage. n sync is just another manufactured dance-pop group with little if no talent.this cd is terrible.just thinking about it sickens me."
1,PURE CRAP!!!!,i think they should at least try!! this trash dosen't deserve to be in the dump!!!DON'T BOTHER WITH THESE LOSERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,The *N Sync's cd is great. This is the best!!,"All of these songs are totaly cool. They realy grab you by the soul. They boys write with magnificent passion, and use all of their heart."
1,They're over-rated and copiers of the Backstreet Girls...,"They're over-rated and if there were any possible way for me to give them zero stars I would. Over-rated. Just when I started to actually LIKE The Backstreet girls, I began to hate every boy band. First there were the stupid Backstreet Girls, then these people, then 98 degrees, then 5ive. Now there's Fresh-step. Golly McMolly! This is only my opinion......."
3,They sing songs about love & life,"N'Sync CD is okay! it's not one of my favorites, but they do have some good songs on their CD."
2,cookie cutter 90's teen pop,"i want you back and tearing up my heart were guilty pleasures for me back in the day, they were catchy pop songs with beautiful melodies, but their material sounded exactly like the backstreet boys. I was never a huge fan of boy bands though, I was more into janet jackson and madonna in 1998"
1,"More bad pop ""music""","Another in a line of pre-fab corporate pop-mush acts. Though they may pretend otherwise in court, just like every other one of these groups, n'sync is owned and operated by a huge company with no soul. It's reflected in the music. Each song on this album sounds exactly like the last, almost as if they were randomly generated by some sort of twisted, evil computer program. Fans of Adorno will love it though, it definitely proves his theories. Try something that isn't forced down your throat through the media."
1,"This is good? No, they still suck...","""God Must Have Spent..."" was written to a child from a mother's point of view. So, why are they singing this? Not only are they torturing the nation with poor, corny tunes, their lyrics (which weren't written by them) are screwed up, too. *N SYNC's songs would not be this way if they actually wrote them."
5,VERY Well Written!,"This was one of the most awesome tapes I've ever listened to!!! It did have one or two dull songs, but the other songs were perfect! I think that their songs are creative, and full are harmony which sounds great! I would fully recomened this for boys, girls, and teens of all ages! You'll never get bored!"
4,I think it is one of the best CDs I have ever herd,"I think I want you back is the best of all the songs on the CD, but all the other songs are okay.The reson I like I want you back so much is the same backround as Backstreet Boys Everybody and I think it is the best beat to any of the songs I have ever herd befor"
2,"Nothing very exciting, but better than the Backstreet Boys.","I give them 2 stars by virtue of the fact that they stand above the Backstreet Boys. I don't hear any very interesting lyrical writing and the music takes few chances, if any. My one compliment of the band is that it appears they do have reasonable voices and do harmonize reasonably well together. In my opinion, in time they will become much better, whether as a unit or individually. The styles and tastes of the times change quickly, it will be difficult for them to keep up, not unlike New Kids On the Block. We will see."
2,Big Miss!,"The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because GOD MUST HAVE SPEANT.... puts my 2 year old neice to slep everytime(what does she know). I can't say ONE good thing about this album. The guys of Nsync basically stink. They don't sing good at all. Live, the sound TERRIBLE. At lease the Backstreet Boy can sing harmonize. Also, they can actually sing live. Not being a big fan of either, I'd choose Backstreet Boys anyday. At lease their is some talent there. Nsync get some voice training & try & have better songs. ONly a little teeny girl would like this album. I've never been so disgusted."
1,Music for little girls,"Their cd is very amatuer-ish, and the lyrics are beyond sappy. The boppy tunes and weak voices only satisfy the current craze of young girls for more boy band music. In truth, only two of the boys in the group actually sing alone. This cd is a forgettable disappointment."
1,monkees clones,"These guys are as bad as the Monkees, but they don't even pretend they can play instruments. They sould make this music easy for little girls to listen to, that seems like their main audience. Put the songs on one of those baby toys, pull the string and the pre pubecent bleach blonds make noises! Scream over a guy that can at least spend the week to learn and play the guitar. And if you really love pop music, there are better groups, try the Beatles."
5,This is a great Debut CD,"This CD is a great CD. Every song has it's own style which is unique unlike almost ALL boy bands. I don't think of *N Sync as a boy band because they aren't totally dense pop--they can actually sing. I have 24 of their CD's. This was the first one I ever bought and I thought it was great. It still is great even after the release of No Strings Attached (by the way, check out my review for NSA, too). This was a great CD for *N Sync to get the world ready for them because I know much more will come where this came from! Peace out and Stay Crunk"
2,"Well, it does help me sleep at night...","I'm sorry, but this the most boring CD there ever was and ever will be. All of their soft songs sond alike and so do their fast songs. I'm giving them one star for the boring songs that help me sleep, and two for trying. My advice is: money is precious, don't waste it on junk like this."
5,Silencio! To all of the Critics,I would like to make a comment to all of the critics out there. First of all if your a reviewer of any kind you are supposed to be open minded to all of the things you are reviewing. I find that 70% of reviewers are saying that 'N Sync is just copying the BSB. 'N Sync cut a record deal way before BSB became popular so it's completely unfair to say that 'N Sync was copying. How can you copy someone you haven't heard of yet? I think that these guys have a wonderful talent and through more experience and less discouragement they could really grow to be even better. Thank You.
2,A Poor Backstreet Boys Imitation (2.5 stars),"The first time I listened to this cd, I didn't like it. The lyrics were usually repetitive and often made little sense. Some of the songs were just plain stupid. A few of them were pretty good, but still only mediocre when compared to other groups, such as the Backstreet Boys. They mostly didn't have a very good beat or tune, though I must admit that the guys have good harmony. Of the songs that aren't overplayed on the radio, only two are particularly good, and it's certainly not worth getting the cd for just those."
5,'N SYNC is the BEST!!!,"I am a mom of a 6 year old little girl who adores 'N SYNC. After buying her the self titled cd and listening to it, I also became a fan. I see no comparison to BSB. The guys in N SYNC have great voices and use them well with each other. We just bought the Christmas cd and that also gets 5 stars from me and my daugher."
5,I LOVE THEM WITH ALL MY HEART,I love this c.d. they can sing so good they look so hot and the know how to preform and how to get the fans involved and they treat there fans with respect and they are honest to there fans i love them with all my heart(mostly justin) and they are haveing a good time doing what they do the best and i know that they will be around for a long time
2,Enough already!!!,"For crying out loud, if this was a group of 500-pound forty year olds no one would know who they were. A few of the cuts were catchy but after hearing them every possible place you can imagine and not being able to escape them they wear off pretty darn quickly!! I think it is about time the ""music"" industry realized there are OTHER groups out there besides 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys that people would like to see and teenage girls who are in obsessive love with Justin Timberlake should realize that it's NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!!!!! I mean jeez, you can't even walk into a bookstore anymore without seeing their ""angelic"" faces plastered all over teen magazines, posters, calendars, not to mention all the endless books about them. Good looks do not equal talent. Please, enough is enough!!"
2,Nsync is just a phase.,"Nsync has some good songs here but there just a phase. The problem with a lot of artists today is that they are dropping their material too quickly. Lets wait and see how long these guys will last. If you want the true original formula, check out the bsboys!!!!"
2,Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ok I'll give N'Sync some credit they have two good songs on their CD I Want You Back and Tearin' Up My Heart the rest is crap. You can tell when a band really tries, and these guys didn't try. They just ripped off the Backstreet Boys' moves, lyrics, and the instrumental parts of the song. I say if a band really wants to be known they'll develope their own style. Obviosly they just wanted to get on the charts and be famous. The Backstreet Boys should be recieving the credit N'Sync is getting."
3,PRETTY GOOD COMPARED TO THE BACKSTREET BOYS!,"This CD is pretty good,but they are nowhere near the talent of the Backstreet Boys. They copied off them! O.K., so I WANT YOU BACK is pretty good, but I say it sounds too much like they're copying off the BSB hit EVERYBODY BACKSTREET'S BACK. If you like up-beat rythem then don't waste your time and your money on this, buy a BSB CD instead!"
5,Da Bomb,"This CD is the best one I've bought. All the guys are good looking, they can all sing, and they are all down to earth. Also if you have the chance to go see them in concert DO! This CD is a must for all people of all ages! BUY IT NOW!!!"
3,BACKSTREET BOYS ARE BETTER!,The songs are ok but the Backstreet Boys sing better. 'N Sync has great dance moves and Justin is so fine but I think they are a flashy group. The cd is better for people who just started to hate Hanson and are getting back into real music. In other words it is great for teeny boppers.
3,pretty cool,"I don't want this to whind up being some full-fledged war between Hanson fans and 'N Sync fans, but I think you all should grow up! I think it's pretty stupid that some of you guys are writing reviews trashing Hanson when 'N Sync is like ten times more manufactured than them! Now . . . I like 'N Sync. I really do. Their music is fun and upbeat, but come on . . . can you base a band on looks alone? That's all I really have to say. Just stay here with your little ALL CAPITAL ten million !!!!!! selves and we'll all be much better off. :) 'N Sync's cool. I'm not doubting that! You guys are just being rude, however . . . Hanson's not ""real"" music? Well, hate to break it to you . . . but I can't seem to find your boys' names in the lyrical credit notes. They don't write their stuff. They don't play it. So it's not fair for you to do that to Hanson! Thank you for reading this. :)"
1,YUK!!!!!!!,"They stink so bad!!!!!!IF you want good music...Get a BSB cd...BSB Look,SING,and Dance MUCH BETTER than N'stink!"
1,N'synce stinks!,"N'synce has just OK songs, and they are a total copy of backstreet boys! THe moves that n'synce has stinks! They stink!"
3,i think that not every song is good in this album,"my favorite songs are tearin up my heart, i want you back, crazy for you, and god must have spent a little more time on you. i luv jc's voice!"
5,I tink this cd is very good and they are the best!,This cd was very good. These guys can sing and look good too. Their songs are cool and is what young kids like to hear. I tink they aren't like the backstreet boys they got thier own sound and look.
5,Very good,"I have to say at the beggining ,I wasn't sure I would love this group, but when I heard their Christmas album I knew the group has some skills. I believe this group can sing, if you take ""for the girl who has everything"" ""God must have spent..."" very beautiful and trust me not a lot of boy band could have done justice to covers like ""Sailing"" (very georgous) ""Everything I own"" (another great song !) The definitely got it. I have to say that JC, and Justin do have a great voice for two white guys and this is coming from 24 years old black woman ."
4,"Good harmony, but not great lyrics.","I liked the album a lot. The only problem is, they could have thought up some better lyrics. My favorite song is ""Here We Go."" It is very good."
5,The best CD I've ever listened to!!! It is BEYOND GREAT!!!!,This CD is a MUST HAVE!!! These guys are extremely talented and you will NOT be disappointed. The CD will make you want to get up and dance as well as sit down and listen. The songs are beautifully written and couldn't have been sung better. Go buy the CD. This band is something you HAVE to hear.
5,They can sing!!,These guys really suprised me. not only is Justin and Lance extremely fine but they can actually sing! First cute guys in a long time that I have ever heard sing this well.
5,A decent cd,I don't know what the deal between 'Nsync and bsb fans are but get over it!!!! I have both cd's and BOTH cd's are tight!!!! If you don't like one band b/c you like the other that is just stupid.the groups are very similar but very different.I think people who slam 'Nsync b/c they are bsb fans or vice versa need to deal with it.But this cd is still hot.And so are those boys!!!!
3,An ok cd,"I admit,I was just like many other people.I viewed NSYNC as another one of those ""teenage girls oriented boy groups."" Once I listened to this cd,I learned that there was more to them.These guys have great harmony.If you would set aside the dancing and all those magazines,posters,and millions of adolescent girls, you could see a great vocal group."
1,New meaning of 'N Sync,"'N Sync does not stand for the last letter of their first names, as they claim. It stands for Never Spend Your New Cash, referring to not buying their CD, which you shouldn't buy. This CD is nothing but manufactured bubblegum and lacks any really worthwhile songs. Keep up bad work"
1,I Don't Want You Back,"If I never have to hear another 'N Sync song ever again, I will be perfectly happy. They're all a bunch of phonies who can't hold a note worth squat. They just jumped on the pop bandwagon to make a quick buck. It's all about advertising. Spend your money on someone who can really sing."
1,Little Girls,"At first, I got the album because of my liking to their first single. But they sound like a bunch of newborn girls. Their awful squawking was quite scary, and their harmonies and songs were incredibly horrible. DO NOT buy this album, and you're even hearing this from an 'N Sync fan."
1,Don't make me listen to this stuff,"Bubblegum, pure bubblegum. That's what this CD is. Keep it away from me, and anyone else who knows how to appreciate music. Whatever you think music is, this isn't it. This is a bad CD put together by five guys who just serve as eye candy for young girls. I see no real talent here."
3,OK if you like them,"I just bought this CD to get my Cockatoo to dance to it like the Cockatoo on the blogs. He started to, but never quite got the hang of it."
1,They O.K.,"They all have very high pitched vocies. At first I thought girls. They could also be mistaken for Maria Carey(I could of spelled that wrong). They just make people like them because of they looks. I think better bands should be on the top 10 list like Offspring and Monica. If you don't agree with me,or don' care, buy this CD."
1,......HAHAAHAHAA,"and someone would wanna waste their precious minutes,hours,days,weeks,months,years,decades, or maybe a century of their life listening to this CD? out of BSB and Nsync, this is OBVIOUSLY the worst cd of them all ( not like any of them are any good ). It's no wonder this band died after a few platinums and a few boxes of condums later. Lets let this cd go to hecko with elton john's music, bruce springsteen, and some other stuff"
5,Harmony is back,"I first got this CD when nobody knew who *Nsync was. I heard ""I Want you Back"" on the radio and was like wow the Backstreet Boys got good~much to my suprise it wasn't them! Duh, it was good music! I think that they are really talented and make good music, ignore the fact that they are ""pretty boys"" they have up beat music to slow jamms~People that think they suck, but like Britney Spears, are just stero-typing and need to get over it! People can not deny that they have nice voices!(they good looks and ultra-smooth dance moves don't hurt!)"
1,"This ""music"" is GARBAGE!","What a load of GARBAGE! we were dealing with this same stuff in the early 90's with other boy groups such as NKOTB. Face it, all you preteen girls will eventually get tired of this group and other's like it. There are so unoriginal it's not even funny In 5 years from now, people will only buy this CD at some yard sale as a JOKE! They are a perfect example of what is WRONG with the music industry nowadays. If you have good connections with a record company and appealing faces to young girls, you can thrown together a record with sappy lyrics and it will sell. Personally, I think a screeching cat combined with a howling dog and armpit noises sounds better than THIS!"
4,they have a different variety of beats and types of songs,"All types of music are given and the group sounds good as a whole. Anyone can listen to this CD and find at least one song that they would like to listen to. Some of the recordings do make you think, and then some just want to make you dance. Way better than the Backstreet Boys or Hanson!"
1,Tearin up my ears,All the 1-star reviews I'm reading on this page pretty much say everything that I wanted to say so all I'm going to say is forget about these has-beens and listen to Stevie Wonder instead.
1,Lame!,"I loved No Strings Attached, and I""m eargerly waiting for Celeberty to come out, but N'SYNC (the cd) was defently a waste of time and money. My friend bought it for me and we listened to it, but after the first song we just listened to Lady Marmalade (remake) over and over and over. The cd was that lame. The slow songs where meaningless, and the fast songs made no sense what so ever. I'm working on a cd, right now, and all I know is that it will NOT be like this one. Thank you for listening. Verne..."
4,Pretty Good,"These boys can actually sing! There are so many singles that came off of this album, and it's just one you need to have if you are an N'Sync fan. They cover two songs that sound really good...God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You and Sailing...and some originals have great beat. Get it if you are an N'Sync fan. Most people probably already own it, though!"
3,"pretty good, but minus a few stars...","b/c they didn't write any of the songs. well, they co-wrote one.other than that, all the songs are catchy, and there really isn't a song i totally hate. the only ones i would question are ""i need love"" and ""giddy up""...but they're still pretty good. if you like that bubblegum style, then you'll love the CD. when i was younger, i listened to it all the time...so i'm sure you'll like it. but if you're older and want a grown-up sound, i would recommend one of their newer cds."
1,n sync are the ones whos copyin here! hello!,"in the backstreet boys review i read that people said tha bsb are tryind to act like bsb and everything! LMAO!!!! noway! cuz bsb were out way before them. why cant ne body notice they way they sing? they sing really weird. most of their songs sound the same, they have really weird voices, they have someof the same dance moves as bsb. look whos the copy cat. why do people say bsb are copying them??? HELLO!!!!!!!! BSB CAME OUT FIRST!!!!!!! I WOULDNT REALLY RECOMAND THIS CD, IF I WERE U ID GET A BACKSTREET BOYS ONE. N SYNC SOUND FUNNY. BSB HAVE NICE SMOOTH VOICES WITH GREAT SONGS. N SYNC ALL HAVE HIGH VOICES AND THEIR SONGS SOUND THE SAME. GET BACKSTREET BOYS!"
1,ABSOLUTE DEBACLE,"THIS IS MUSIC? YEAH RIGHT? IVE HEARD ANIMALS FART BETTER IN THE FOREST THAN THESE FIVE BUNCH OF WANNABE'S. PINK FLOYD BEATLES WHO, JIMI HENDRIX, DOORS, GROWLING BEARS RULE BABY? I HOPE TTHESE GUYS GET LAUGHED OUT OF THE BUSINESS HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great music that rules.,"The vocals in this group have made this a great CD. They have some of the hottest music on the market and they can only get better. Over all, the music is totaly ""all that"". The song ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" has to be the greatest on the CD, though. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!"
1,Just another piece of garbage!,"I cannot beleive I bought this! They are just five guys trying to fork money in their lives! Also, girls (i am a girl) like them so much because they think their songs are just so hot. Yeah, whatever, all they think is that the boys are cute."
4,Good but not great.,"Nsyncs debut album was never out of my CD player when I was kid. I re-bought it a few weeks ago and dose it stand th test of time? Yes it dose.This CD has some classic songs on it that any 90's kid knows by heart. Songs like Tearin' up my heart, I want you back, God must of spent a little more time on you, and I drive myself crazy. Also on this disc is some fun songs that will get you dancing like You got it, Here we go, Crazy for you Giddy up. Catchy songs all and all fun. There is also a great cover of Everything I own.I take away a star beause there are some songs I skip. Sailing, I need love, and for the girl who has everyting I could do without. Fun CD, but not as good as their efforts wit Jive, but stll album woth having for Nsync fans or 90s junkies."
2,I dont know about Nsync but Nstink YEAH BABY!,"No matter how hard I tried I just cant give them props for their music. Not only are they incredibly SHALLOW but they diss other music. They think they are greatest thing to hit PoP music, but I hate break it to you...BsB already did. If they aint sorriest, cloning,syrupy, albinos I've ever seen in my entire life...... Britney is doing them the same way they did BsB .... stealing their fame and mooching off the success of another group .And I'm not gonna do that BsB vs. Nstink thing cause everyone already knows which band is the best and that's BsB hands down peeps! Gotta Bounce..Peace Out"
5,What are you people talking about?,"Most of you who are giving bad reviews have obviously not even truly heard it. Bad voices? Hello?! The only reason you think that is because they are trapped in this boy band persona. The songs are similar, yes, but for you BSB people, so does BSB's old CD. I love the new one though, they have really progressed. Anyway, N Sync only re-made ONE song and that was Sailing, so stop exaggerating. Moreover, if you are more into Limp Bizkit and Korn, that's great. You still need an open mind though, cuz I like Korn and N Sync. If you have not even heard their voices, or even thought while listening, then don't comment! This is a place for reviews not misplaced judgment."
4,Cool,"The CD is pretty good. I like it a lot. They have cool dance beats and sweet ballads. My favorite song from this CD is 'I Drive Myself Crazy' then, it's 'You Got It.' I'll put it this way: the only song that I really don't care for is 'I Need Love.' I also own the Christmas CD. That one is pretty cool too. My fave song from there is 'The Only Gift' because Lance's voice sounds so COOl. I still personally think that the BSB are more mature and better looking than 'N Sync. I love 'N Sync dearly, but they are no match for the BSB. There's no way POSSIBLE that they could outdo the BSB in anything having to do with music."
5,BEST CD IN THE WORLD!!!,I am a music lover from Malaysia.I bought 'N SYNC cd eight months ago.This is the best cd I've ever bought because all the songs are really nice and cool!'N SYNC and their producers are really talented and good.I love their music very much!Keep up the good work 'N SYNC and God must have spent a little more time on all of you.God bless 'N SYNC with LOVE!Thanks for reading my review.
5,N'SYNC Is Great,This album is the coolest. Justin is so cute and his hair is so hot. Lance is cool. My fave song is God Must Have Spant A Little More Time On You. I also like Tearin Up My Heart. N'SYNC is the coolest band around.
5,Awesome CD. They rock and so do their voices.,NSYNC is the best band in the world. Their music is great and clean. So are their faces especially JC's. He has a great voice. If you like this band check out hanson and 98 degrees.
5,"Clever Pop music, covering distinctive remakes, AWESOME","This CD is a breakthrough for pop music. The guys have enough energy and vibrancy in their voices to make the dance ryhthms incredible (though some lyrically lacking), the ballads are like nothing else, 'God Must have Spent a Little More Time', 'I Drive Myself Crazy', 'For the Girl who has Everything', 'Everything I Own' and best of all 'Sailing' (an incredibly justifying remake of Christopher Cross), are the obvious gems of this album. J.C's voice is obviously the glue of the group, Lance's (low voice) & Chris' (High voice) adds texture. Meanwhile Justin is great with ballads and Joey adds a mellow finishing touch to the remarkable result!!!"
5,"Dude, you have to get this CD!!!!!",This one of my #1 CD's it is sooooooooooooooo cool you willnot regret getting it! I listen to it every day like 4 or 5 times!
4,Good and Bad...,"Some songs were alright. The best song I thought was good was ""sailing"". A lot of people have this CD but doesn't even know it's even on it and it's one of the best songs. Their voices are such in harmony. I can't wait for the song ""Music of my heart"" to come out because it surely took my breath away."
5,I love it!,"As their debut CD, I think that 'N Sync did very well on their self-titled disc! It shows originality and creativity and has become one of my favorites to listen to!!"
3,""" I Drive Myself Crazy"" is decent.","N Sync's album is mediocre. It isn't particularly great nor extremely bad...somewhere in between. Some tracks are good such as ""Drive Myself Crazy"" and ""God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You"". The other songs didn't really appeal to me. I have to honestly say that I prefer Backstreet Boys. This has nothing to do with the never ending comparison between the two groups. I am judging the group on their own talent and musical terms. I have to say JC has a great voice though, the best out of the entire group. He nails the high notes in the ""Drive Myself Crazy"" video. Still, I prefer the music of the Backstreet Boys. Brian is the best lead singer."
3,It's Not Entirely About The Boys,"When boy bands are concerned, people usually think it's all about the boys. But actually, all that the ""boys"" (one of the N Sync guys was 27, when this album was released) do is sing & dance. What really matters is the music &, to some extent, lyrics. These things haven't got anything to do with the ""boys"". So, think of the group as a group of musicians, who indirectly go by the name of N Sync (or BSB, for that matter). Coming to the point, this album is strictly for pop lovers & not for those who hate pop.Yeah, it's true that only Justin & JC can sing and that Justin's voice is sometimes nasal. So buy this album if you are more into music than into the singers' voice. And it's also true that a few songs are really good."
3,Good Introduction,"Although this isn't my favorite of *NSYNC's work, I have to say that their self-titled album was a good introduction to those of us who had no clue about them. The CD is filled with happy, dance-friendly songs that definitely got them noticed to the public in a time when the Backstreet Boys were the reigning kings of boyband pop.Stand out tracks:I Just Wanna Be With You,For the Girl Who Has Everything (In my opinion, the best track),&I Drive Myself Crazy (or Thinking of You - depending on where you're from).Some of the songs are little corny, but all in all this CD introduced the world to five guys who have great vocal talent and paved the way for the even better music that came from the group years later."
4,First taste of *N'Sync,"*N'Sync's first album, titled ""*N'Sync,"" was released in 1998 from WEG. After three years of being together, their first album made them more famous than they had ever imagined possible. This CD includes hit singles ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" and ""God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You."" Some of the songs are love songs set to catchy dance beats that you find yourself bobbing your head to. Others are sweetly-sung ballads that are music to your ears.If you enjoy music that makes you smile, dance, and want to sing along, as well as spend time with the ones you love, this CD is for you. Well worth the money, this CD will be enjoyed by you and yours for years to come."
1,AUUUGGGHHH! IT'S THE INVASION OF THE BOY BANDS!,"Okay. Lets get one thing straight. These guys ARE good-looking. I mean, you gotta be blind or something not to think so. And they can dance extremely well. An idiot could tell you that.However, comma, when you get past the, ""Oh God, they're so cute; I wouldn't mind if Justin drove me crazy!"" stage, you realize that they don't really have much musical talent. The lyrics are so cheesy, and they are trying way too hard to sound emotional. They don't write their own songs, they don't play their own instuments, and to top it off, they sound extremely whiny. I don't call that talent! This goes to show the final score for N'Sync: Looks:5, music:0!!!!!!!!!"
4,In The Dark..........,"N Sync are not so big here in the UK. Infact there nothing but a mere Boyband. But having seen them a couple of times on TV they're actually quite good. They're harmonies and vocal ability are not as good as BSB but the N Sync boys can dance. From what I hear from my friends in the US these boys are huge. Goodluck you guys, want a tip to make it big here in the UK?? you need to promote yourselves a little more and perform more acappella's turst me BSB did that when started off and look at what they have acheived now???? PEACE!"
5,The greatest CD I own! And Jusitn is sooo cute!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have to say that this is the best CD that i have ever listened to! Justin is soo hott! but ne ways ""GOD MUST HAVE SPENT (A LITTLE MORE TIME ON YOU)"" is the best song! it's so sweet! And i love the way they have some fast songs and some slow songs on the CD. Back to Justin, I like you a whole lot! NE ways good luck to the group and just don't ever forget who you are."
3,"""How cuuuuuuuuuuuuuute!!!"" LOL","Back in the 90s when I was in my early teens, I was never a fan of NSYNC, mainly because they were designed to make the girls squeal, and I wasn't a girl :) But looking back at that time from today, it makes me remember just how CUTE NSYNC's fans were. They would all giggle and squeal over them and had pictures of trheir favourite NSYNCer up on their locker doors and bedroom walls. And whenever they talked about the group, they'd do it in high pitched squealy giggles.""OOOOOOOoooohhhh I loooooooooooove Justin! He's sooooooooooo cuuuuuuuuuuuuute!!! I'm gonna marry him some day! *squeal squeal squeal*Those squealy NSYNC fans taught me that girls are precious and to appreciate how cute they are! Those squealy girls were really ""cuuuuuute!"" *squeal squeal*"
1,Giddy Up...Away from this CD.,"N*sync is the possibly most overrated group of all time. True they have legions of fans all over the world, but can you imagine when those horney young pre-teen girls grew up and found this CD in a box in their attic? They were probably asking themselves, ""Why the hell did I buy this crap?"" Those girls are now calling the boys they once loved, the boys that love eachother. However, I won't go on complaining that N*sync is gay, because you can't really prove that. Other than the fact that they're all guys that spend...a lot of time together. But Justin got his d**k sucked by Brittney Spears! I recomend this CD for 90's nostalgia sake. Only if you still think Justin is hot, or if your gay. See U in the Future..."
1,This Cd deserves a -100 stars,Girls Girls what is it about stupied boy bands that they get you to buy there worthless cd? Is it looks? It must be! I'm not a player hater i'm just saying stop buying music for looks you can't actually see that person when they sing so stop wasting your money and go get a haircut or something! :)
1,WHAT THE . . .?!?!,"Alright, you have got to be kidding me!!!!!!! There's is no meaning to these songs!! Nothing you can learn from!! Life is always perky, and having trouble with love isn't gonna kill you! Why not listen to Metallica, Or Black Sabbath, who actually have deep lyrics and people of all ages listen to, instead of this boy band who probably weren't even old enough to shave when they started the band! And the name?!?! How did they get that?! Anyway my theory is that your wasting your money on something you're going to hate in a month! If not 1 week!"
1,You Gotta Be Kidding,"This is Awful [junk]. As always, the Music industry is desperate to cash in on a NO 1. They assemble a band like NSTynk who has no talent and sells them to the public because they can do stupid dances. It is sad to see what has happened to a the great pop industry when they had real musicians that Iam sorry to say that is gone ."
2,SORRY BUT I DON'T LIKE THIS VERY MUCH,I like some of the songs on this cd lets say: Tearing Up My Heart That would be the only song I like-although I'm not exactly sure. I listened to most of it at my cuzin's house it didn't sound so well. She would usually buy the same cds as I would but this time N'Sync was on her own.
3,The Boys are OK.....But not the best......just OK,"At first I really didn't like the cd much,all I listened to was the singles off it.I listen to it a lot more now.Mostly 'cos all my friends are just madly in love with them and the songs are always in my head.I think the guys have descent voices and good songs,the lyrics aren't exactly top-notch though.And they aren't even their own lyrics!I recommend this to people who like sappy lyrics and dancing guys.....if not....stay far,far,far away from this cd.Personally I think just about everybody out their should buy Hanson cds,much better voices,lyrics,music,performance, everything....BSB are good if you want QUALITY pop.Their new cd hits store on May 18th.Go get it!"
5,You must buy this CD,"I first heard about N SYNC on the Disney Channel when, for about a month, I WANT YOU BACK and TEARIN' UP MY HEART were playing on every commercial. At first I was thinking, Oh, great. Another music special I'll hafta steer away from every night, because the DC has aired a special w/ Brandy & Ray J a year ago, & since I'm not especially a big fan of their music, it bugged me to death. However, after I heard I WANT YOU BACK a few times, I was glued to the TV every time I heard it come on. I bought their CD & I listen to it every day. It takes a lot for me to open up to something I don't like (such as this kind of music), & now I'm listening to it 24/7, so I guess it must be a really great buy, huh? Seriously, if you've listened to anything like N SYNC before, you hafta go out and buy this CD!"
2,Not worth the money.....,"If you are a fan of the New Kids or Hanson, this might be the album for you. But, it's just another bunch of teenagers wanting to ride the Backstreet train!"
1,Sorry.. nsinc has got to go!!,I though this cd was going to be good... but when i bough it... hum... just going to say I totally wasted my money.... I mean what was that??? don't get me wrong... but first time i heard their first single it took me away.. but when i good their cd i was shocked... all the songs pratically were the same... so sorry but they got to go!! well that's only my opinion... i'm sure people won't agree with me.. but that's ok..
2,IT WAS OKAY!,"I LIKE SOME OF THE SONGS LIKE TEARIN' UP MY HEART, CRAZY, AND I WANT YOU BACK, BUT FRANKLY, ALL THEIR SONGS ARE RATHER REPETATIVE (SP) IF YOU WANT A REALLY GOOD C.D., TRY THE BACKSTREET BOYS! N SYNC ARE, HOWEVER, MUSICALLY TALENTED AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING NEWER SONGS FROM THEM WITH A CATCHY TOON LIKE 'GOD MUST HAVE SPENT A LITTLE MORE TIME ON YOU!'"
1,I really don't think it is a great buy....,"Boy band fan?? I am. But this doesn't have great harmonizing songs, just plain ""let's make money fast!"" songs. They also have many songs that keep repeating the same chorus over and over which makes u want to hear anything but that CD.If I were u, I would buy the Backstreet Boys Millenium album with many nice ballads that catch your heart and soul which makes u melt when u hear it, I promise u will hear this CD and never, ever get tired of it. Sincerely."
5,N Sync is absolutely awesome!,"If you aren't an N Sync fan yet, you are missing out on the best band around. Their self-titled debut album is awesome. The song ""God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You"" is the sweetest song I have ever heard. If you don't already own this CD, buy it now!"
4,Typical Top 40,"N Sync is halfway decent, but after a while Justin Timberlake's voice gets annoying. It's just too whiny. They should let Lance Bass sing more leads; his voice is 10 times better. ""Tearing up my Heart"" is easily the best song on this CD."
1,It was absolutely horrible!,"This CD was terrible. When I as listening to it, I had to ask my sister if she was playing the same song over 3 TIMES! She wasn't. All of N Sync's songs sound the same. They have 2 tracks- one for a slow song, and one for a fast song. You could just buy those two tracks and you would have the whole CD. Whenever I try to sing the hook for ""Tearin' Up My Heart"", I end up singing ""I Want You Back"". Do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS CD!"
5,The only talented pop boy group,"In a world of teenybopper boy groups, there is only one that possesses true talent. And that group is Nsync. I can't understand how anyone can compare them to the BSB, or any other boy group. Nsync has talent, determination, and skill, which all the other boy groups seem to lack. Try putting on BSB's CD...maybe you'll figure out that they use the same background (and that cursed clap machine) in every song. All they do is slow it down or speed it up. Or 98 degrees, who's vocals are like child's play compared to Nsync. But, to all the people who wrote a review for this CD and put in ""1"" star, it's obvious to me you couldn't tell talent apart from a singing monkey. So you can stay away from this music, because they don't need you. As a matter of fact, WE ALL don't need you."
1,WHAT?!?!?!?,"What is it with everyone saying that n sync has its own identity, and isn't copying bsb? HELLO? N SYNC HAS NO IDENTITY OF ITS OWN!!! That's right, it doesn't. All they're doing is singing someone else's music, not even PLAYING the music to boot! They're being themselves? Huh? What? Thay would be themselves if they'd write & play their own music. Until then they have no individual identity. Maybe they don't sound exactly like BSB, and their songs may even have their own sound (although i think they sound like all the other 5 pretty boy bands out there) but this is NOT their own identity! It's an identity created for them by other people. Please don't support this type of music by buying this CD. If you have already bought it, take it back for refund like I did... Why? Because except for the few songs on the radio (which get really old after a while even) the rest of the CD falls flat on its face."
1,A talentless manufactured boy group,"First of all, if you think the group members are cute - that's fine, but realize the music is only sequencer crap and the lyrics are utterly banal and meaningless. Second, this is just another lame group ripping off New Kids On The Block and Take That, with nothing new or original to offer. I know you wouldn't like them at all if they looked like five balding sumo wrestlers. Third, why listen to this crap when there are talented, hard working bands out there like Nirvana, 311, Soundgarden, R.E.M., Cake, etc.? Sure, maybe the members are not as ""cute"", but the songs are a lot more interesting and very meaningful. You have absolutely no excuses for listening to this pitiful excuse for music."
1,(God most NOT have spent) A little more time on them!!!,"Doesn't any girl NOT like 'N SYNC? I'm a girl and I say people should listen to KORN, ORGY, and LIMP BIZKIT!!!!!! For all the boy crazy girls stop wasting your time on boy bands! If you ask me BSB, 'N SYNC, and 98 Degrees all sound the same so stop makin' such a big deal on who you like the best!!!"
1,WHERE IS THE TALENT?????,"COME ON PEOPLE. THESE 5 PRETTY BOYS CAN'T SING FOR SMACK. THEY HAVE NO TALENT AT ALL!!!! IF YA HAVEN'T NOTICED, MOST OF THESE REVIEWS ARE WRITTEN BY TEENY-BOPPER GIRLS WHO ARE IN LOVE WITH THESE NO TALENTS. THIS IS WHAT I DON'T GET. WHY IN THE WORLD ARE THESE GIRLS IN LOVE WITH THESE GUYS. I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT EVEN GOOD LOOKING. MY FRIENDS ARE IN LOVE WITH THEM, AND IT'S GETTING ANNOYING. JUST TELL ME THIS, DO YOU LIKE THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR TALENT, OR BECAUSE OF THEIR LOOKS, 'CAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE EITHER OF THEM!!! I WISH TEENY-BOPPERS WOULD JUST QUIT PRAISING THEM 'CAUSE THEY'LL END UP FADING AWAY JUST LIKE NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK! THEY'RE ONLY HERE FOR MARKETING REASONS! NUFF SAID!!"
2,There ok,I like a few songs by 'N sync...I love the song Tearin Up My Heart...I Like BsB a whole lot more though....
1,How bad can one band be,"Nsync is just a bunch of oh baby, baby i love you(shouting and crying). I have never heard anyhting worse than this junk. It doesnt deserve1 star not even a half. They are horrible!"
3,Okay if you like pop music...,"This CD is okay if you like pop music. They do sing good and their voices blend great, but I think they do better with R&B, not pop. ""Giddy-Up"" and ""I Just Wanna Be With You"" are the only songs on here I really liked. The other ones are just either too bubble-gummy or too ""pop."" I sold this CD about half a year after I got it. So, you'll like this cd if you're interested (or should I say obsessed) with the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and other teenybopper singers."
2,Okay....,"Well, this album was okay for a debut, but as debut are getting better and better, you might think this is terriable, like me. Tearin Up My Heart has the most confusing and annoying lyrics ever! And there's just a downward spiral from there. They have good voices and amazing harmonies, but the songs and beats are not what I expected from the band that brought me that awsome song ""Game Over"". So buy Celeberty instead of this, unless you want to complete your collection, but you will be dissapointed."
5,This is a Definate MUST have!!!,*N Sync is the best band out there in my opinion. they're music is up beat love songs and they have some slow jams that will stay in your head for days!!! buy it and trust me you wont be able to stop listening to these hot and talented guys!!!!
1,IN STINK,This group of performers has made a lot of money claiming to be musicians. All their songs are written by some balding 50 year-old man. They couldn't play musical instruments if their lifestyles depended on it.
1,Skip over this one,'N Sync fails to show any true musical talent. They stick to the same basic harmonies and beats. Their variety of songs is limited and lack any real style. This CD is mediocre at best. Save your money for artists with talent.
1,"come on, people","if you honestly think that this is real music, then i don't know what you're you're on, but GeT OFF IT! IT'S BAD FOR YOU'RE HEALTH! not on;y do they sound like they have strept throught when they sing, they play no insterments, they don't write their own songs, and ANYONE COULD DO WHAT THEY DO, AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A PRETTY FACE,AND TEENYBOP STYLE. i want to try and give constructive critisism, but i don't think that anything could save them!"
3,USA girl thought it was ok!,"Im a teenager & I like all kinds of music. My favs range from Backstreet Boys, to Limp Bizcut & Korn, to Marvin Gaye & Lauryn Hill, to Jay-Z & Madonna & Gloria Estefan. SO, you'd think I'd like Nsync, but I really didn't. Yea, their music sounds like the Backstreet Boys, but they sound NOTHING like them. The Backstreet Boys can sing really good & they can harmonize & sing acappela real well. Which is a lot more than I can say for Nsync. Some advice guys, you could use somemore voice trainning, cause no matter how screwed up the music world is. You still need some form of talent to make it."
3,Decent and bearable,"I happen to be a big fan of pop music and slow jams by boy bands. 'N Sync one of those typical white boy bands that have been so popular recently. This CD has catchy songs, and some cool lyrics. In general, their voices probably aren't as good as the Backstreet Boys- not all of them could sing verses, but I like Justin and JC's voices. Chris' voice annoys me a lot, which is unfortunate, since he carries many of the melodic parts. On the other hand, I don't like the way the Backstreet Boys act as public figures and I dislike how their personalities appear on camera and in interviews, but I love 'N Sync. They seem like a cool group of guys. In addition, sticking with the whole bopper theme of pretty much all of these other reviews...JC looks super-fly!"
5,I Never get tired of this CD!,"I originally bought this cd because I adored JC when he was on MMC (I was a huge fan when I was a teeny-bopper). I never expected to listen to this cd as often as I do. I have listened to it hundreds of times (no joke) and I never get tired of it. Each time I listen, I hear something that I never noticed before. I think they are all extremely talented and that this is one of the best debut CDs that I've heard. The songs they released: ""Tearin Up My Heart,"" ""I Drive Myself Crazy,"" ""I Want You Back,"" and ""God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You"" are all great, but the unreleased songs are just as good, if not better. This is a great cd and I'd recommend it to anyone music lover."
3,This is okay,"This is a pretty good CD. But have you ever noticed that they sound EXACTLY like the Backstreet Boys? I figured out why!! The same guy--Max Martin--writes all the hits for both groups. Isn't that sad? But I do like ""I Want You Back"" and ""Tearin' Up My Heart""--I indulge myself in a boy band once in a while. :)"
2,LADIES. . . .N'SYNC IS AN INDUSTRY PRODUCED GROUP!,"Ok I do admit that some of their (N'Sync's) songs get stuck in my head and I'm not here to bash them. BUT. . . these guys were brought together by some rich guy and given voice lesson and taught to dance. Notice in all these BOY BANDS there's usually. . 1)The older one 2)the young baby face 3)two that are related 4)the kinda weird one 5)the HOT one 6)and the bad boyThese bands are prototypes they haven't played together for years AND EARNED their success (like Rolling Stones, Dave Matthews, REM) I just hope that these guys don't go spending all their money because only the BEATLES have made this formula a success. THANX"
1,THE WORST CD BY THE WORST BAND!!!!!!!!!!!,This CD is the worst of worst. Terrible songs and the guys sing terribly! I hope you do not by it for it is a big waste of money. Thesongs are the WORST!
5,NSYNC-This cd ROCKS,"HEY EVERYONE. this cd rocks. ya well, i would say everyone go get this one. i love this cd and the song ""god must have spent a little more time on you"" that song is so awesome and i love how they dedicated to their moms. ya nsync- keep it coming. p.s. their concerts rock!!!!"
1,Never saw what the big deal was with this????,"Believe me, I have nothing against N'Sync (I love ""Bye Bye Bye"") and I think Justin Timberlake is very talented and is doing great in his solo career, and all of the guys can sing, AND I adore bubblegum pop from the 90's, but this album did not do anything for me. There was not a single song I liked."
1,Non-Biased review...,"Ok I will say there are talented pop artists out there, but this is easily some of the most degrading and worse kinds of studio produced music ever. Insincere lyrics used to target a 12 year old base group so they could sell as many records as possible, get good looking heart throbs to catch these teen and tween audiences, then make all the music for them, use vocal distortions, and aggravate an entire generation oif males to no extent. They aren't very talented singers in the first place, they don't really right any of there music, they aren't sincere, and it saddens me to think that girls are stupid enough to fall for these guys. This is a rebound from New Kids on the Block, and something to compete with the Backstreet Boys. When will it end? No talent here, just a bunch of corporate liars and theives here. Don't support this smut. It's simply degrading to all people everywhere."
5,Ultimate 'NSYNC fan!,"This is the first cd I bought from these guys a couple of years ago, and I am the ultimate 'NSYNC fan! I have all of their cd's! 'NSYNC rules! I love all of their songs!"
1,One star for Tearin' Up My Heart and none for them,"I just can't believe that all you people can get so excited over squeaky high-pitched superstar wannabes like the Backstreet Bums and these guys when majority of their music sounds the same, they get their own producers to write songs for them, and then get success for it. Why not try writing some of your own songs, please. Even Andrea Bocelli has co-written a few of his songs, and in any clips of his music videos I've seen he can play the piano, but he's no Stevie Wonder. Still, I just love the man for what he is, not like these clowns and Sarah Brightman in particular (whom I'm starting to get sick of). ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" is the only acceptable song on here,"" but ""I Want You Back"" and others sound almost identical to it. So much that it's hard to determine a decent song. And you're all excited about this? Two years later, I STILL don't get it."
4,This is Great,"This is a great CD but i bet it would be much more better if the boys wrote their own songs. Otherwise, i love J.C. Peace ya'll."
1,"this album is good for dancing to, not much else","I think this album and this band is extremely shallow and unmusical. The lowest pop music can sink is n'sync. The lyrics basically consist of ""I love you baby, yeah yeah."" If you are looking for an album you enjoy listening to, please don't watse your time on this album."
1,This is crap!,"The only reason I give it a 1 is because i cant give it a 0. This is complete crap. They can't even sing. Yea, they can dance, but not sing. Wheres the talent. I cant compare Nsync to anyone else in the music industry, because everyone else is better, even the bad, talentless people. At least Backstreet Boys have some raw talent. They can actually sing good. On the radio & live, which is a lot more than I can say for other artist(nsync ASPECIALLY included). Id put them(Backstreet Boys) in a class with really singers, such as Jodeci & Boys 2 Men. They dance pretty good to. All I can say is nsync is TERRIBLE. They cant sing, & they dont even look that good. At least there are talented people in the industry like Backstreet Boys, K-ci & Jojo, Boys 2 Men, Lauryn Hill, & Steven Tyler to keep good music alive."
1,This is the worst cd ever!!!!!,"This is the worst boy band of them all!Come on they're just a group of guys who get paid for what your doing right now.If you want a good boy band backstreet boys are the band to go with,they're way better."
1,TERRIBLE,"IT SEEMS LIKE NOWADAYS ALL A BOY HAS TO DO TO GET A GIRL IS SAY ""I LOVE YOU"", ADD SOME BACKGROUND MUSIC OF PEOPLE GOING ""OOOH YEAH, BABY"" AND ALL THE TEENAGE GIRLS START SCREAMING. IF YOU WANT SOME REAL MUSIC GO BUY SOME NIRVANA OR PHISH, AND DONT GET THIS, ALL THE SONGS ARE THE SAME AND IT WILL END UP AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR CD PILE."
2,Whatever!,"Hello!! Can we say BSB wana-be's!? Backstreet Boys rule, and N'Sync sucks. That's all there is to it! Later."
1,This is awful!!!!,"Backstreet Wanna-boys!!!! Yuck!!! DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!! Sure, ""I Want You Back"" and ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" are good, but the rest is horrible. Most of it sounds like crappy eighties rip-offs, and too many of the songs are (or sound like) remakes. If you want a boy band cd, get Backstreet Boys or Five. This is terrible. And the Backstreet Boys are MUCH better looking."
1,Yeech!!!!!!!!!!! ::gag::: ::groan::::,"If you think this is the best CD in the world, then you haven't been paying attention in Band or Orchestra have you guys. You haven't really LISTENED to REAL music have ya?N Sync is only selling their looks, and whatever talent they have (which isn't much).Get something real! Like Bach or Hole, Mozart or even Marilyn Manson. They had style, they had grace, they had talent, and they earned it the honest way."
1,It's another one of those white boy bands,"Give it up, these songs are so sappy that they make me pray towards my ears for forgiveness. How pathetically sappy and happy can you get? These little boys just dance, prance, skip, and sing a little then become the idols of little girls the world over. Society...it's screwed!"
1,I Don't Like Writing A Bad Review But...,"I don't like writing bad reviews (especially on first albums) but I can't stand not writing a review for this. NSYNC's first album stinks, their second album...mixed feelings, and their third album rocks! I find that disturbing that it took NSYNC three albums to rock. Sure, they had some hits on their first and second album but too many flaws that 'Tearin' Up My Heart', 'I Want You Back', 'Bye Bye Bye', 'It's Gonna Be Me', 'It Makes Me Ill', and 'This I Promise You' couldn't cover. All I can say is, THANK GOD FOR CD-SINGLES!... For songs you like, get CD-SINGLES. Don't spend your money on this. If I've offended all you NSYNC fans, I'm sorry. Don't take this review personally, it's just my opinion. Everyone has a right to their own opinion so, I'll respect the five star reviews because that's their opinion as long as you respect mine. Okay?"
1,NOT SO EXCITING,"SO 'NSYNC IS NOW THE BIG HIT CRAZE. OH PLEASE I MEAN REALLY! COME ON GIVE ME A BREAK PEOPLE! YEH MAYBE ONE OF THEM IS CUTE, BUT OVERALL THEY ARE UGLY!! THEY'RE SONGS ARE OKAY, BUT THEY'RE SONGS ARE JUST COPIED OFF OF BSB'S. I REALLY DON'T SEE WHAT ALL OF THE SCREAMING IS ABOUT. THEY'RE JUST BSB WANNABES. BSB WERE ALREADY DEBUTING BEFORE ANYONE HEARD OF 'N SYNC. IF YOU ASK ME, ALL YOU GIRLS WHO 'WORSHIP 'N SYNC' OR HAVE 'I LOVE N'SYNC' ALL ACROSS YOUR BODIES ARE VERY STRANGE AND NEED TO GET A LIFE. MUSIC IS NOT THE WHOLE WORLD AND NEITHER IS 'NSYNC.'NSYNC HAS NO TALENT AND JUST COPIED OFF OF BSB!"
1,Fifteen minutes and counting.....,"A friend of mine's little sister played this CD for me, and for a minute, I thought that I was listening to a new Backstreet Boys CD. I wish that the talent scouts who find these ""Teen Beat Magazine"" posers get a group together who, for a change, sounds different! I must say one thing good about this CD, it keeps the mallrats out of my favorite stores whenever this group is in town for a concert."
1,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! CRAPOLA,GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGEWHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE MUSIC INDUSTRY THIS IS NEW KID WANNABE'S TERRIBLE. WHERE ARE THE BEATLES PINK FLOYD WHEN THE WORLD NEEDS THEM
5,THE GREAT NSYNC,This group is an awsome band.They have a great voice together! I would know because i am one of their biggest fans.They are one great group of guys.They all have a great talent.They deserve more than 100 stars! They are the greatest group i know of!:) I love this group one day i hope to meet them.Both of there cds are awsome! To all the NSYNC fans your awsome!
2,N'SYNC ARE BACKSTREET BOYS WANNABES!!,"Okay, the music is okay, and I know that's really what your looking for, but N'SYNC are just losers! I mean, they totally copied off of Backstreet Boys, who came first. And what's with all of the remakes on the end of the alblum? The originals were much better!"
2,"NSYNC is a complete copy of BSB.,","This group is a complete copy of BSB. I am a more bizkit or rock group fan but, I cant help but realize how much all these boy bands make millions for the same songs as the damn BSB. If you watch TRL on MTV all you see when people write in on the internet are "" oh justin is so hot, i wouldnt mind he he drove me crazy"" It so stupid. I mean limp is behind nsync for a crappy song they just repeated from 98 degrees or bsb. NSYNC SUCKS. thanks"
5,Them HOTT BOYS!!!!!!,"Anyone out there who don't like them are Crazy! Their cd is da bomb and so are they.I love the song ""God must spent a little more time on you"" It is enchanting and cool! I also like ""tearing up my heart"" that is my favorit. All the people of the world, know this, they rule!!!"
4,Pretty Darn Good,"Alright. So you al want to buy NSYNCs CD. or are wondering what its like. Well let me tell you. Their voices are great. Soem reviewers dont think so...but they are. The problem is the songs they sing. Dont get me wrong. the whole CD is really awesome. Songs like I need love and you got it just aren't an nsync style. However, their main hits such as I want you back and I drive my self crazy are priceless. They recorded this CD A LONG time ago so you have to understand they were all about 16-18 years old. still new in the business. They couldnt choose the songs. But none the less the upbeat tracks are dancable, and the slow songs are definatly ""aww""able. If you like the songs Tearing up my heart and the other hits you'll love the rest of the CD. The next album will be even better, mopre edgier, more R&B..more nsync. Get em both."
1,They could have tried harder,"I think NSYNC could take some lessons from the Backstreet Boys. BSB sings together and they have great harmonys, NSYNC on the other hand does the complete opposite they never sound like there in the same group."
1,"Its all been done.... and better, too.","This CD is awful. Its the perfect money making fodder for all the little teen-bopper girls. Its almost like nowadays you can put the words ""love"", ""na na na"" into a song and it will send the little girls screaming! Please! Just listen to track 7 to find out the quality of their songwriting. This is basically the song.... ""I need love, I need love, I need love, we all need love, need romance, give me a chance, desire, fire"". Thats the song. I prefer lyrics a lot more meaningful than these. Come on, all this has been done before! Personally, Backstreet Boys does pop a HELLUVA lot better than N'stink-oops, sorry- N'sync. Don't buy this album."
5,"This CD rocks the house, not just the released singles.","This CD is awesome! It proves the guys talent. Some songs are more intrucate than the ones released, and it would be hard to judge this amazing band on the hit singles onlly. Trust me, I've been listening to it for over a year now and still find new intrests in it and I haven't gotten sick of it. Plus, on the Teen Choice Awards, they won best album. This is the best CD to ever hit stores! If you don't hasve it, for heaven sakes, go and grab it right now or you'll be missing out on these wonderful singing talents! NSYNC RULZ!"
5,The CD is awesome. They have the best voices.,"The CD is awesome. 'N Sync has the best songs and they sound good doing them. They have the best voices. My fav's are Tearin' Up My Heart, Here We Go, God Must Have Spent a little more time on you, I want you back, and Crazy For You. If you buy it, you will get hooked and be an 'N Sync-crazy person. But that's not a bad thing, it's a good thing. My fav 'N Syncer is Justin."
4,Great Rythm,"This cd will have you up singing, and dancing to the music the only bad song is every thing I own."
1,You're driving me crazy too.,"I first saw the N'Sync video in Target. That's the only place worth playing that crap. What a joke. Even the Backstreet Boys are better. Even Five is better and who likes Five?! N'Sync comes in last place on my list along with Milli Vanilli and Los Del Rios (or whoever wrote ""Macarena""). Personally, if you want great music, buy Chumbawamba or better yet, Rammstein!!!"
5,'N SYNC Rocks!~,"I luv this CD. I've been a fan every since they were in Europe. I'm glad they are back in the US. This CD is great. I love the beats to all of the songs and I love the cover and I can't wait till they release they're new single ""Tearin' up my heart"" in June. BUY THIS CD and THEIR SINGLE ""I WANT YOU BACK""."
1,EEK!!,"I probably wouldn't give this CD any stars if I had the choice...they are unoriginal with boring songs that can't be told apart from any other 'boy-band' songs! I got the CD as a gift, and thank god I didn't spend my own money on it! Eew..boring songs, boring CD."
3,"Good, but.........","'N Sync's CD has some great, uplifting songs. It also has some songs well done slow songs, such as ""God Must Have Spent A Little More Time on You"" and ""I Drive Myself Crazy"". There's only one problem, though: there are only two types of songs. The two types are uplifting and harmonious. The songs begin to blend in, and once you have listened to the CD you feel that you have listened to two songs, although you have listened to nearly an hour's worth. That is a small problem, though, that shouldn't take away from your enjoyment to the CD. I have never really enjoyed teen boy bands, but when the Backstreet Boys came out with Millennium it opened up my eyes. Keep up the good work, 'N Sync!"
3,"average, but better than BSB","i wouldnt really say that everyone that likes korn or limp bizkit wouldnt like this CD, because i have it and i often listen to it. i have to admit though, its not one of those albums that you can listen to and not have to skip thruogh songs, some of them really suck, and some just make me laugh, like 'giddy up'. i mean, why the hell are they trying so hard to sound black? they cant, and they should leave it alone."
4,I like it!,"I admit,I was one of those girls who loved the Backstreet Boys and hated 'N Sync.Then recently I heard their new song ,""I Drive Myself Crazy""and fell in love with the song and group.Although I sill LOVE BSB;I also admire 'N Sync.I wish them long success andgood luck!!"
5,*NSYNC RULE!,I went to 1 of their concerts;and I loved them They were great! If u haven't got their c.d.; go out and get IT Quickly!THEY R DA BOMB!
5,The Best CD I Have!,"I think this is the best CD you can get! Justin, Joey, JC, Chris, & Lance (My Favorite) all sing so well together. If you liked this CD, you should definitely get 'N The Mix, their home video. I will. Stay crunk, y'all!"
3,ONLY THE RADIO SINGLES WERE ANY GOOD,"IF YOU LIKE THE SONGS FROM THE RADIO ENOUGH, THEN BUY IT BUT I WOULDN'T RECCOMMEND ANY OTHER SONGS ON THE CD FOR ANY REAL LISTENING QUALITY."
3,the greatest cd ever,"the songs on this cd are the greatest i especially like ""i drive myself crazy"",""for the girl who has everything"".this cd should be one of your favorites because it's one of mine!"
2,Did this really come out in 1998? It sounds so freaking OLD!,"I really doubt that anybody listens to this lousy group anymore. This CD sounds ancient and dated only a few years after its release. Those computerized drum machines and sound effects were trendy and hip in 1998, but now they have an undeniably ""dated"" feel to them. So dated in fact, that they wouldn't sound too out of place on an oldies radio station between Elvis Presley and The Beatles. I was born in 1984, which means I was in my early teens when this cr@p came out, and now those memories of thousands of horny 12 year old girls squealing so hard that tears ran down their faces seem so LOOOOOOONNNGG ago now. It really seems like a completely different era. And NSYNC is just an outdated relic of that era. Boy bands are ancient history now, just like The Beatles or Elvis!"
2,TEENAGERS MAKE ME LAUGH!,"I chortle at the thought of this song. It reminds me of the funny relationships between teenagers and how stupid they can be, especially the tall ones."
5,GOD MUST HAVE SPENT A LITTLE MORE TIME ON YOU,"JUSTIN , JC ,JOEY ARE HOTTIES! CHRIS LOOKS BETTER WITH HIS HAIR NOW THAN HE DID. LANCE IS SORT OF CUTE."
5,It's the best CD ever!!,"This CD I would say is the best CD ever created. If you like *N SYNC as much as I do then you know anything they put out is good!! I rate this a five star CD because all 13 songs on this CD are great! Each song has a different ballet, which makes them as good as they are! If you're thinking about buying this CD then do it! Stop wasting your time on reading this thing when you could be listening to the CD!!"
1,Is this purgatory?,"As the year 2000 approaches, signs of the apocalypse are upon us, like why people like this horrible ""music."""
5,This is definately the best CD I've ever bought.,This is the best CD I have ever heard. I have very high hopes for *N Sync to make their next American CD just as good as this one! Good job *N Sync!
5,I usually don't listen to pop.....,"I usually don't listen to pop..... But I can't get enough of these guys... I am 22, and I have like every CD I can get my hands on... I just want to say they are great and deserve more credit and respect than they seem to be getting :)"
5,HOTTIES,NSYNC has got the flow they are awesome they sound great and there so HOT!!!!!!!!!!!! Get there CD
3,It is okay...for this type of music.,"I generally don't listen to this type of music, except when I am depressed. When my friend lent me the CD, I figured, why not. I had to stop and think, ""Is this the Backstreet Boys, or another group?"" when I heard it. This album is decent, but there are only a few select songs I like. They are just a BSB wannabe clique. All that aside, the CD is good."
4,They are great performers physically and vocally.,"I am not what you would call a ""groupie"". I have a little sister who loves 'N SYNC and I am subjected to them quite often. I am 21 yrs. old and I can relate to a choice few of their songs, but I am not a huge fan. They are great performers live. They harmonize beautifully. However, I believe they were a day late as far as coming onto the music scene. If they would have surfaced before the BSB, they would have been much larger. Keep up the good work and they shall stay afloat at the surface. p.s. JOEY ROCKS!"
5,I LOVE IT!!!!,"Wow, this is the greatest CD. I am so glad i got it. Dont hesitate, you will luv it too!!!"
5,Great and Nicely Made Product,"I bought this puppet for my nephew who was turning 2yr. He loves sharks so this was perfect. It was soft yet durable and it looked like it would also make for a great doll to sleep with. The hole underneath for the hand seemed a bit small for an adult, but the puppet was larger then I expected and nicer as well. It was a great buy for the price!"
2,C'mon guys....,"I wanted CD racks that would fit inside a cabinet I own, and these fit. These are neat in that they have adjustable dividers so you can group your CDs as you please.These racks fit jewel cases.Exactly.So if you have jewel cases with paper slip covers, you have press firmly to get them in.C'mon guys, this ain't rocket science. If you're gonna make a rack to hold CDs, make it fit all CDs."
2,Lackluster,"Laura Branigan is great, but this CD is pretty negligible. Essentially a whittled-down repackaging of Branigan's 1995 ""Best of Branigan"" CD, this collection omits several key tracks (such as Branigan's Top 10 classic ""Solitaire""), while ignoring other hits like ""Shadow Of Love"" and ""Shattered Glass"" to include non-hits such as ""Over You."" If you want a good Laura Branigan hits collection, pick up ""Laura Branigan - Essentials""; it's remastered and has most of her hits."
4,Gret CD,"Good CD I bought this CD for one song ""Gloria"" from Flashdance but there are other songs on there I like as well Gloria is not on the Flashdance Album"
3,Not quite a sellout,"After having seen Agents live at the Flood Zone (club in Richmond--same time slot Dave Matthews used to own) and twice more after that including just this past year in a small club, I have to say they've come very close to selling out their own refreshing brand of music. All of these tracks are a little too electric and slick, and make an original fan yearn for the improvised, more acoustic grooves heard on Straight Around and in their first release (not offered by Amazon), Where'd You Get That Vibe? While I dig Upspin and this version of Smiling Up the Frown, there is nothing on this disc that rivals Get Me There or Straight from their live production. Worth picking up, but don't think you're getting an accurate picture of what this band is really all about."
1,"Great live band, wait for the next disc.","I assume that Agents was trying to sound more mainstream than their fusion-laced, awesome live shows, but their attempts at hard rock here miss the mark. You have to listen very hard to recognize their immense instrumental talent, something that is immediately apparent in their live shows."
4,A deep look into the friendship gap between men,"Locking Arms by Stu Weber is a profound book. He examines the importance of male friendships throughout history and in the Bible between Jesus and his diciples. I found the book to be a vital tool in understanding the complexity and difficulty of establishing long term male frienships. This book surely sheds light on the missing link of masculine friendships. If we don't lock arms as the author illustrates using many examples, then we are destined to exit to the False Roads To Manhood, abandoning the essence of male friendship, share values, unselfish love, deep loyalty, and real transparency to reach authentic manhood."
3,The Jane Jeffrey series is always fun.,"Housewives and amateur detectives Jane and Shelley volunteer at a local museum established to honor the late Pea King Auguste Snellen, who earned his fortune selling seeds for varieties of peas he developed. As always happens when Jane and Shelley are around, there are murders to be solved. The first victim is the young director of the museum. The pace seemed to be slower than in other mysteries in the Jane Jeffrey series. There also wasn't as much interaction with the children, or as many of the everyday chores of a mom and housewife that have made the characters so real in other books in the series, and I missed that. But as always with this series, it was a fun, cozy read."
1,A Catchy Title,"The best thing about this book is the title. Jane Jeffry and Shelley Nowack are not interesting characters and the action drags. It wasn't quite bad enough but what I was able to finish reading the book, but I wouldn't buy another in the series. Well, anyway, now if someone asks me if I have readWar and PeaceI can say, ""Well, not exactly. . . .""watziznaym@gmail.com"
1,flat tire is a drag to fix and keep fixed!,If the tires did not go flat all the time it would be a great cart but my tires go flat and it is a drag takeing the time and MONEY to replace the tube. Do not buy the cart! I wish I never had!
4,Unsafe at any speed,I've had this cart for a few months now and find it really useful for hauling the trash down my 200 ft driveway. It just holds two recycling bins perfectly. There is one improvement the new owner could make - maybe the manufacturer should have thought of it - and that is to spend a few minutes with a file taking all the sharp edges off. I discovered this the hard way - after a dead of night hauling session. I got back to find myself covered in blood from the three fingers I sliced on the rear door. They honed the edges so well I didn't even feel it.
5,Perfect for the Beach,"We used the Tipke Fold-It cart for our recent trip to the beach. This cart was perfect. It folded great for packing. It took seconds to unfoldit to use. It pulled easy across the sand with no problems. I would recommend this to others. I think it will last ok for intermittent use. i don't think it would hold up for daily use.Overall, great product."
4,Lightweight and relatively robust,"Everytime I pick this thing up, I have the impression it's going to fall apart, it's so light. But guess what, I've just finished moving 25 yards of mulch all over my yard and it's still in one piece! I wouldn't recommend it for heavy duty use, but for a small yard like mine, it fits the bill. My girls are also using it when they carry their stuff to horse shows (blankets, saddles, buckets, etc.). So far it's been a good investment and hope it holds up. Looking forward to taking it with us when we carry our stuff from the house to the beach at the Outer Banks. By the way Amazon, what is the warranty on this cart?"
5,Extraordinary,"This is the best recording I've ever heard of Gershwin's two big piano works. Eugene List is just phenomenal. He plays with a big, steely sound, but has plenty of feeling for the jazzy accents of both works. I can't praise Howard Hanson's contribution enough. The orchestra simply speaks Gershwin, in a manner that only a great conductor who absorbed this music and the influences on it in his youth could bring off. Hearing Hanson conduct Gershwin is like hearing Serafin conduct Verdi, so complete is the identification with the composer. The sound engineering is some of the best Mercury produced in Rochester, wide ranging with plenty of detail. I do question what Stars and Stripes is doing here, although it is a good performance with a student orchestra. Nevertheless, this is essential listening for the Gershwinaholic, as iconic in its way as Oscar Levant's performances."
4,Funny and informative,My husband and I really enjoyed this. It was funny and certainly conveyed important points in a way that seemed to get through to my husband. It's the best thing we've found that is directed towards dads and it does a great job of reaching that audience.
3,Not good for English speakers who are learning Bengali,"This book is probably good for native Bengali speakers but it isn't very good for English speakers who are trying to learn Bengali. When I look up a word its gives far too many meanings, often a dozen. It does not specify which meanings are the most common usages of the word. When I read Bengali the dictionary really does not help me find the meaning of words I don't know. You might find the Bengali-English section of Teach Yourself Bengali by William Radice more helpful, but unfortunately it doesn't have all the words I come across when I am reading. Thankfully I got this in Bangladesh where I only paid $1, because I really can't use it much."
2,JUST OK,"Not worth the money in my opinion. Some nice pictures, but not as up-to-date as I expected. Seemed to focus on the very heavy spanish influence. There is more to southwest design than this book offered."
1,Very poor Kindle purchase,"This book may be good as a regular book, but I purchased it as a Kindle eBook and it was a terrible waste of money.The images - a critical part of the content - are tiny, like internet thumbnails. It is impossible to see details on the Kindle screen. When you zoom into them, they are very poor resolution and show less than the silly postage stamp size view. So... it is not a picture book. There has to be a more refined way of translating a picture book into an eBook. I realize that shrinking down the image sizes makes it easier to transmit the book, but this is worthless.Nor is the book valuable for the text. The text reads like it was scanned from a hard copy but never edited to correct OCR errors. There are numerous mistakes and erroneous characters, rendering the text meaningless in some places.It is an offense to Amazon customers to sell this as an eBook."
1,not bulk,"This is not ""bulk"" so why advertise it as such...? 1 lb./16 oz. is not ""bulk""--it is a normal package size."
5,great,"Great product!!! My kids love these quitars, it is the right size for the younger, early learning stages of guitar playing. Super!"
5,Excelente,"Este album contien 8 excelentes canciones interpretadas por Hector Lavoe, las mejores siendo Ghana'E y Barrunto. Es un clasico de la musica de Puerto Rico."
2,"Buyer Beware, Misleading Description, No Toad Here","The product description says 'Frog and Toad Together Frog Plush Toy, 6.5.' A more accurate description would be '6.5-Inch Frog Plush Toy From The Books By Arnold Lobel.' I reasonably thought I was getting 'Frog' AND 'Toad.' But I got just 'Frog.' Nobody wants just one. Should be sold as a pair. Product description should be fixed."
5,The Myth of Democracy Promotion,"Robinson has written a truly intellectual book on democracy and democracy promotion. While the world debates whether or not the US government can or cannot promote democracy, Robinson demonstrates that Washington has a history of trouncing rather than promoting democracy. US policymakers have over the years desired pro-US regimes that hold elections rather than truly democratic governments, since truly democratic government may run counter to US interests. His book is a sober and much needed addition to the democratization literature that is mired in an unhealthy acceptance of elections and democratic values as the major characteristics of democracy."
1,He doesn't even know what the word means!,"The word ""polyarchy"" means ""rule by many,"" as opposed to ""oligarchy"" - ""rule by the few"" - and ""monarchy"" - ""rule by one."" The author talks about rule by the few - oligarchy - but assigns it a word that actually means the opposite - polyarchy. It stands to reason that if he doesn't even know the meaning of a word in the title then his book probably isn't the best source for intelligent information and analysis.I see though that two people gave this book five star reviews. Maybe this shows just how much our educational system has been dumbing everyone down. Or maybe it shows that some people have been living in an Orwellian paradigm for so long that they're accustomed to being told that black is white. Maybe both..."
3,Not as Good as First Two Seasons,"First, full disclosure: I haven't watched all the episodes of this season, but I'm unlikely to as my wife and daughter have become too disgruntled with the quality of the show. I don't feel that disheartened, but there is something that is starting to feel a bit formulaic as well as depressing with this season. Part of it is the acting. Debra Winger's character (or maybe it is DW as an actress) just doesn't work or hold much interest. The displaced Indian, Sunil, is a good actor, but there isn't that much interesting depth--at least not 2 discs in. The best is the disaffected, adopted gay teenager. He's done some fine acting and offered the most depth. A bit sad to let go of this. Perhaps we will return to it."
2,Disappointed,After season one and two (which were super engaging) it was disappointing to watch season three. The characters appeared to be rather overdone in that they came across as unrealistic. I could watch seasons one and two over and over but season three was difficult to even get through the first time. Disappointing overall.
4,Great Show!,This is a great show. The item arrived in new packaging as well which I thought was a very nice touch.
3,Quick delivery but questionable quality,"DVD set was delivered in two days. Picture quality of DVD was not good and clear like DVDs should be. Probably will not buy from a second party again, wonder if it was a copy."
5,Wonderful series,"Great series, I didn't notice any change in quality from season 1 or 2. Very interesting twists on the character's personal life"
1,Lame rap,"Honestly, who would want to buy anything by a rapper named ""Tiny Peewee?"" What a stupid name. Who comes up with these monikers? ""Yo, I'm Tiny Peewee, don't diss me or I'll bust a cap in yo' metatarsal joint."" Too bad there's not an illustration of the back cover of the CD. The guy is parked in a what appears to be a recent suburban development. What's he gonna do? Call the Home Owner's Association on me. Sheeeesh."
4,A fascinating perspective on garden design,"This book is not just another step by step garden design book. It is a fascinating look into the mental and psychological processes of garden design. Fran works to awaken and inspire the gardener to design a personal and unique garden that has meaning to its owner. The book is broken up into seven design stages. Fran says that these techniques can be used to unleash creativity and that gardening empowers us to go on to be successful in other parts of our lives. Each section has exercises to help us design our own gardens that are personally fulfilling to us.If you are looking for a paint by number plan to quickly create a nice looking garden, this book is not for you. If you are looking for a book full of shiny pictures, you will be disappointed. However, if you are interested in jump-starting your creativity to help you plan and make a unique garden that reflects your personal style, you should have a copy of Digging Deep on your bookshelves."
4,Good book but...,"If you are buying this book for it genealogy researchs don't bother. All of W.E. MacClenny's source material is wrong but the rest of the book provides a an accurate description of the trials and difficulties Rev James O'Kelly and his fellow ministers had during that time. Never in the history of the Christian world had there been a time when Christianity and the government were not one so Rev James O'Kelley had no model to follow, he and his fellow ministers had to make it all up as they went alone a fact they do not get enough credit for. These ministers were as important to the founding of the United States as were Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams because if not for these ministers many of the common people who filled the ranks and shouldered the muskets would not have done so against their King, God's divine representative on the earth. These men were able to sway the masses to lend their support to our founding fathers."
1,Worse bunch of so called singing I have ever heard in my life!,"I neglected to review or even look at the singers on this cd! My fault. BIG MISTAKE! I was expecting classic, sing song, mellow, lull you to sleep Christmas songs, instead I got a bunch of yelling and screaming that got worse and worse as each track/song progressed! The only one I liked was the first song by Nat King Cole. I ditched the thing in the trash right off."
1,bad QC,"I received my dustbags today and tried to put them on. Unfortunately what I received must have been a training version for a first-day employee. It was covered with red marker ink indicating where they were supposed to sew loops and seams. Unfortunately, the person marking it must have also been having a bad day. Some loops were marked and sewn 5"" apart, while others, were more that 24"" apart (trust me, I measured). Needless to say, I have requested an exchange from Amazon[.com]--let's hope Delta's QC folks don't let more of these out.Also typical of the last few teims I purchased from Delta, the packaging and/or directions don't match the current state of the product--this one came in a package that said top dust bag, so I started to worry, but then there was obviosly the bottom bag in the package as well."
2,"""Where's the rest of me""","I used to like Jack Chalker's work and on the strength of his earlier books picked up this trilogy at my local library. The first two books were OK and he did generate some interest and tension in them but this last book was a big disappointment. This book should have been where he went for it and released all the tension he tried to generate in books one and two. Instead, he ran out of steam, lost interest in this project, copped out, take your pick. The big finish just dissolved into largely incomprehensible and unsatisfying mush and was about as interesting as limp, three week old celery in the crisper drawer."
5,Everything you need to know about your female canine,Excellent read! This book is not only for those interested in breeding. It is a book that covers every aspect of the antomy and phisiology of a female canine. Great book to use for a reference and it will be referred to again and again!
5,Review of Book of the Bitch,"I was pleasantly surprised by the colloquial English used in the book. Some areas of whelping appeared more difficult, but were made understandable to the layman. I especially enjoyed the English colloqialisms in the book. The authors definitely give enough information so that the first time breeder knows what to look for in the puppies, the delivery, as well as the selection of the bitch, the stud, and what can happen in each phase from pre-breeding to the sale of the puppies."
5,The biggest help for first time whelper!,I have just started raising my English Mastiffs and Bullmastiffs and was worried this book would lean more towards the little dogs like most books. It was great! I had it right next to me when the time came for the puppies to come!
4,GREAT BOOK FOR CHOCOLATE FANS,This book contains wonderful recipes. It is the best cook book I have ever purchased on chocolate recipes and I have 5 others.
1,not a new book!,"The description said ""New"" whereas we received an old, used book. Felt cheated.The return process wasn't smooth either. Had to call customer service to receive a return label."
3,"Odd film with campy, cult-classic value","This movie has some kind of strange place in my heart. I watched a funny edited video on a popular video website comprised of clips from this film, and so I became curious and decided to purchase it myself on the cheap a few years ago, mostly for kitschy purposes, and just to have a copy of it. It's pretty bizarre, with crazy, nonconforming animation. The plot is out there, and I can't help but wonder if the animators were under the influence of something. The same voice talent that voiced Chucky from Rugrats voices the title character, David, but I didn't even know that until I looked it up because everything in this movie was so trippy and distracting that I could not tell.It's definitely not in the same league with Disney films of the same vintage, but I get a great laugh every time I watch this thing. Again, bizarre!"
4,A decoration with which to decorate,"It's pretty cool looking, exactly what I was looking for. If this product intrigues you, buy it. It's definitely worth the price."
4,Beautiful piece,Very pleased with this purchase. The statue is exactly what I expected. Would recommend to anyone interested in this item.
4,"Good belts, and not too expensive","These belts are as good or better than the Gates Green Stripe I used to buy, and cheaper, too. I've used a few of them now on amphibious all terrain vehicles and have had no problems."
4,What's wrong with John Denver,"I could never understand why country music was so against John Denver. In the 70's when Denver was big, he sounded more country than most of the music at the time coming out of Nashville. Charlie Rich threw a fit at the CMAs, but wasn't ole Charlie just as non country as Dever was. ""Back Home Again, Some Days are Diamonds, I'm Sorry, Thank God I'm A Country Boy"" are all stone country songs that still to this day are looked down on.This collection is pretty good. As far as I am concerened, you could take any recording John Denver ever made and call it country. And also, any greatest hits or best of collection of John Denver is never complete. This is at least better than those cheesy packaged greatest hits cd's from the 70's and early 80's.This makes a great cd for your car, now collection wise, it is for novice's. Go out and get one of those boxed sets if you are serious about music."
1,Cheap piece of junk,"Hair headband elastic broke the very first time I wore it within ten minutes, and could not be fixed. Amazon seller did refund purchase price when I complained, but requested I return it at my own expense and retract my feedback. He called me to say he was ""just a store"" and not really responsible for the product's quality. Personally I wouldn't sell what I couldn't guarantee to be at least useable more than once. I lost the rather large shipping charge I had paid, of course, as that was not refundable by the seller and then also had to foot the bill to return it. The Tony-Tail company should be ashamed of making something so junky and poorly made. Must be designed and intended for pin heads, I guess. If you have a tiny, tiny head I guess it might be useable, but not for average sized heads as it comes apart too easily where the hair is glued to the elastic. I would have rated it a zero or even a minus one, if I could."
3,plastic but cheap,"It fit perfectly and is fairly stable. Made of flexible plastic so it's on the lower quality end but it does what is intended and the colors are bright. It's low price made it attractive. Amazon shipping was good, as usual."
3,Atmospheric re-view of the major Asian urban battle of WW2,"This is a highly detailed account of the bitter fighting which left Manila in ruins. The voice of the book appears to be that of a committee, and it lacks the unified vision and humanity of say, a Cornelius Ryan. The authors seem to be smugly ""wise after the event"", bringing modern-day sensitivities to what was essentially a fight-to-the-death city wide bar-room brawl. Nonetheless, it's a must read if you are planning to go to Manila, where you can still visit the scenes where these vast, and minor, tragedies were played out. Soak in the atmosphere, but ignore the judgmental pronouncements."
3,"Impartial, hastily written history of a bloody urban battle","Experienced British military historians add little to existing accounts of the greatest urban battle fought in the Pacific during WW II, judging without evidence, with little original research, failing to utilize most published sources and failing to realize the Japanese defenders had been ordered by Imperial General HQ to fight to the death. My view is based on extensive reading of those sources, talks with survivors and my personal presence at the scene"
3,From a Filipino,"The book details the thorough destruction of the most beautiful part of Manila which was south of the Pasig river. I was there during the shelling by American forces and the killing and raping by the Japanese marines. Friendly fire killed as many civilians as Japanese atrocities. What is lacking in the book is the perspective of the battle from a Filipino's eyes. All the examples written by the authors and all the anecdotes are those of Europeans. If 200,00 civilians were indeed killed during the battle, 99% of them were Filipinos! Yet, hardly any Filipino sources were used by the authors. Just look at the photos of the victims: all Europeans!"
5,Great Watch!!,"I bought this watch for my husband for Father's Day. He loves it. This is a very nice looking watch. The band is made of thin rubber, which makes it lightweight, but seems durable enough. Very good quality. You certainly can't beat the price. Shipped on time as promised by the seller."
5,"Just like my father's WWII watch, only better","Had an expensive dressy watch that I found increasingly harder to read (the date square was too small) and the dial too monochromatic for my eyes - so when some $90 to repair part broke, I looked on Amazaon, found this watch loved the retro look, the large numbers and date square. The rubber like black wrist band reminded me of my father's WWII watch with the leather band that always smelled and finally fell apart. Altogether a very happy camper with this one."
4,"Funny, sweet, and a perfect showcase for Jim Gaffigan!","Anyone who liked Jim Gaffigan on David Letterman last night should check out this film. Instead of getting three minutes on national TV, Gaffigan gets 85 minutes in this film, and he never wears out his welcome. The supporting cast around Gaffigan is great, too, especially T.J. Jagodowski as his ""normal"" friend. The film is surprisingly well-written and well-acted, given what appears to be a shoe string budget. I found the director's commentary interesting, too. As an aspiring filmmaker myself, I found it sort of inspirational to hear everything the directors went through to make this film; their tales are a vivid reminder that these days pretty much anyone with enough moxie can go out and make a feature-length film. It's a pity film like No Sleep remain unknown while the studios keep pumping out drivel."
3,"Great movie, bad shipping, poor quality","I ordered the movie as a gift and when I received it, when you moved the DVD case, you'd hear the DVD inside clang around. I called Amazon and returned it for another one, but the same thing happened. I think it may just be something with the manufacturer and its way of packaging.Also, while the movie is funny (as all of Jim's stuff is), the movie quality is very poor. It almost looks like someone just made it at home in their basement and printout out liner for the dvd case."
2,Boring,Jim Gaffigan is a really good comedian. I recommend Beyond the Pale highly. This probably would have been more interesting to me if I had been part of the Hockey culture.
3,You know how it pains me to go off the itinerary,"I think Jim Gaffigan is hilarious and I am a huge fan of his stand-up material. This film, although it is quirky and funny, did not properly showcase the full range his comedic talents. He doesn't really ""cut loose"" in this role, as you might imagine he would. It's an extremely low budget production, which is cool, but the story could have been played-out better. It has its moments, but it's not quite what I was expecting. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I were a hockey fan."
3,"Some good humor and moments, but sloppy","I found the quality of the writing quite uneven. Whereas I usually love Jim's stand-up comedy, the filmmakers' apathy is visible even in the title to ward off prospective viewers. ""We couldn't think of a way to add actual colloquialism, so we sloppily used the pseudo-colloquial, unnecessary abbreviation we saw in the Taco Bell commercial."" ""We failed Elementary School English, thus don't know the simple word till."" ""We were so busy on the other aspects of the movie that we couldn't be bothered by coming up with a decent title."" I don't hold the low budget against them, just the apathy.Rating: Entertaining enough for a non-hockey fan to see once."
4,Even better if you know French,"I don't. Still great music. If you have seen Anggun in concert, you know she can do no wrong. The third track even made me cry and men don't cry, especially when they don't understand the words? For the most part an upbeat album."
4,"Wonderfully orchestrated music, okay vocals","Anggun's voice is beautiful. It carries out strong and confidant to match the driving beat in her songs, ""In Your Mind"" and ""Saviour,"" while becoming cool and husky during, ""Something Sublime."" All of her songs are beautifully arranged and each has a unique quality that seperates them from one another. However, her voice is not as complimented with the songs that lack the deep, techno-like beat of ""Saviour"" and it comes across as too plain. Some songs, like ""Devil In My Mind"" and ""Captivity"" may have become top hits had they only been sung by a different musician. But for those of you who love Cher, Sarah McLachlan, and Rita Coolidge, you will love Anggun."
2,Not an excellent toy for a 2 year old girl.,"I bought this Dora for my little girl who loves Dora, but it wasn't what I expect.She looked excited with the doll, but not with its functions. Finally she took Dora like another baby doll with diaper. Nothing excited."
3,HOW MEN GOT SO BAD,"Marc Feigen FasteauThe Male Machine(New York: McGraw-Hill, 1974) 225 pagesA very good book on the masculine mystique--especially on business, sports, & war as theaters of 'masculinity'.If you would like to discover even better books on this subject,search the Internet for the following exact words:""Best Books On Gender-Personality"".James Leonard Park, creator of the Gender-Pattern Chart."
4,Underappreciated,"John Stewart is perhaps the most underappreciated singer/songwriter of the singer/songwriter era. And this is one of his most underappreciated albums. It finds him in his mature voice performing mature songs. This is grownup music for grownups. I'm not sure why it appeared with so little notice--perhaps because John's fans already heard most of the songs on earlier, minor releases such as Neon Beach and Deep in the Neon. But thses performances are fully produced in the studio, and and this gives provides another dimension."
2,Tired,"Got to agree with those who say Elvis sounds out of it and tired and those who say the sound quality is terrible - sounds like it (and he) have been to space and back. Still, if 'You gave me a mountain' doesn't make you cry, not much will. 'On Stage' album is a much better bet for potential investors, I think."
3,So tired,"I love Elvis' music and that's a fact...But,if you listen to this cd carefully,you'll notice that something's wrong...Elvis didn't feel well,that evening...worse,than that...And you can feel it...It gets even worse if you listen to the DVD ''Aloha''(I don't what did they do,but you can hear Elvis actually fighting for his breath...I'm so happy I have a VHS-MONO version of the same spectacle)...The perfomance of ''Suspicious Minds'' is almost poor(try ''Garden'' version and you'll hear a difference)...Elvis could sing(even better than in 1970),but that wasn't his nightListen to the ''Fever''...It's much better than the studio vers...I'm sure he had one that nightBuy This Cd!!! Still,It is great !!!"
5,"ALOHA, MY FRIENDS!!","I have ""Aloha from Hawaii - Via Satellite"" DELUXE EDITION DVD and for me that is an amazing show, but I can enjoy it only back home. Well, I had a good idea!! I said to myself: ""Valeria, you must buy the CD too, so you can hear it wherever you are"" And so I bought it!May I give you some advice?BUY IT, YOU TOO!!!I LOVE ELVIS"
5,Elvis at his zenith,"The crowning moment for the king of rock n roll came here.This concert represents Elvis' towering moment.His best 70s album,his greatest concert album,his best tv special,his greatest live performance.That does not mean it was down hill from here.There were great achievements that still lied ahead for him...but this moment captures Elvis at his absolute best.His voice was in full throttle on Steamroller Blues,You Gave Me A Mountain,My Way,I'll Remember You,It's Over and An American Trilogy.He knew exactly what he wanted from a song and was in full command of his talent.His ability to grab both a song and the listener are on full display during his rendentions of Welcome to my World and Something.See See Ryder,Burning Love and Suspicious Minds are classics and Elvis' versions of each during this concert might be their finest.This truly was the moment he had waited for.And he came thru...like he always did."
5,For 'King' Lovers,"If you grew up with and loved the ""king,"" this is the ultimate. I listen to it over and over during car trips, and it's tremendous each time. His ""American Trilogy"" is a fantastic way to appreciate America."
5,The quintessential Elvis -- superb!!,Elvis at his very best. This collection is the King the way we should all remember him.
5,the best!,"all that needs to be said here,is a few short words; if any man has ever looked better, performed better or sung better than EP did during this concert in hawaii, then i have yet to have witnessed it in my 43 years...completely awesome...scott..."
5,This is why he's the King,"This is a great collection of Elvis live tracks. I'm a recent fan of the King's and must say that this is an awesome performance that just keeps you interested the whole way through. I love the fact that he just does his biggest hits, which could have worked so easily. Included on ""Aloha"" are many great covers including the Beatles ""Something"", Peggy Lee's ""Fever"" and other greats. His hits like ""Long Tall Sally/Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On"", ""Suspicious Minds"" and ""Hound Dog"" are short but great. The at time newer songs ""See See Rider"" and ""Burning Love"" are my favorites on the disc.I must admit this is my first Elvis album, and I know that there are many more to buy, but I know that the fans will love the impression that Elvis' voice and just personality create on this recording. It's really something that will never be caught again. Elvis is indeed the King of Rock and Roll."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"This was not just a concert, this was a historic event. Elvis had exactly one hour of satelite time to sing to the entire globe! He did it beautifully. I saw the special back in '73 and bought the album, but with the constraints of vinyl records even this double album could not contain it all. Finally this CD has the entire concert from beginning to end. Well worth the price for anyone who loves good music."
5,beautiful and useful map and guide,"On medium-weight, semi-glossy paper, this beautiful and durable map folds out to approximately 2 feet by 3 feet. On one side is a three-color highway map of the coast of Maine, inlaid with paragraphs on many of the lighthouses and framed by watercolor pictures of about two dozen. The reverse side describes all 65 of Maine's lighthouses; the descriptions give a short history, the optimal viewing spot, directions, contact information, hours of operation, transportation options, etc.If you are interested in lighthouses, Maine, nautical history or maps, you will probably love this great map. Travellers will find it indispensable. What a bargain!"
4,Fills the historical gap,"Very few books exist on Pakistan, let alone Pakistans interesting political eladers. From Ali Jinnah to Bhutto to Zia to Benizer and Musharef Pakistan has hosted some very eccentric and interesting leaders. Ali Bhutto was in many ways the descendant of Jinnah. He was worldy, not a fundamentalist and most of all he became the guide for Pakistan's entering the modern world. Unfortunatly he was hung by one of his own generals, setting up the historical drama of his daughters return to power.A very neccesary read that fills the essential gap in Pakistans history, 1967-77."
2,Not Effective,"The most insightful advice in the book comes on the first page of Chapter 1 - ""All decisions have three parts: 1) you identify your goals 2) you identify your options; and 3) you choose from among your options"". The rest of the book goes downhill from there. Nothing much more is offered. The examples used tend to lack demonstration of insights into real-world effective decision-making, which is unexpected considering that he studied the decision-making process of Middle East leaders. The second half of the book I found to be tedious without much actual usefulness. Even the selling points, the 9 main steps to effective decision making, are redundant and can be reduced down to those 3 parts stated earlier. Very boring reading. You can throw out most of the chapters and it wouldn't make much of an impact on the overall book. Pass on this one."
5,Sinatra at Zenith,"I have a copy of this recording from a pirate LP of several years ago. Since Frank wasn't doing concerts at this time, this is a unique treasure. This is Frank at his best! I would like to know if, of the many club appearances of Frank throughout these years, are there any recordings extant that can be released? What a treasure those recordings would be! Great CD! I want more!"
4,Almost the best 1812 Overture,"For years Antal Dorati's version of the 1812 Overture with real cannon and church bells reigned supreme, then in the early 1970s RCA trumped it with Igor Buketoff and the New Philharmonia Ochestra, featuring a chorus singing the original Russian songs from which Tchiakovsky derived his work, plus genuine Russian church bells. While the cannon and bells on Dorati's version are spectacular, I found myself falling asleep waiting for the fireworks to begin. Still this CD is well worth having. The Capricio Italien is great and Wellington's Victory kicks butt."
4,Jolly Good Fellow !,"Just an informational comment. The melody for what we in English speaking countries know as ""For He's a Jolly Good Fellow"" is actually from a french song,""Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre""(""Marlborough Has Left for the War"" ) which Beethoven's audience would no doubt have recognized.Ditto on comments regarding this recording. Not the greatest music but loads of fun to listen to."
5,Wellington's Victory Etc.,"As a huge fan of Beethoven's 7th Symphony I wanted to listen to the song it was debuted alongside: Wellington's Victory. While searching for a version that would be great, I found this recording. It is a great song and an authentic one at that (using weapons from the time period as is intended).Bonus was an outstanding version of the 1812 Overture (also using the correct period weapons).Highly recommend!"
4,The choir is missing!,"I really do hate to be a nit picker, BUT! Seriously, I greatly enjoy this version of the 1812 overture. It has to be one of the all time if not THE all time best selling classical LPs (over 2 million) and I do get a WOW! reaction each time I listen. BUT! To go to all of this bother with the cannon and church bells and NOT include the choir is just a little disappointing.There is a great version by Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra with the Mormon Tab Choir that I have on LP that has the entire recipe including choir, church bells, and great sounding cannon."
2,high praise?,"i am completely at a loss for words as to why so many people say this is the best 1812 ever. my band director in high school played this for us as a demonstration on how brass players should not play. at no point does the brass sound good. they are constantly out of tune, out of balance, and out of character. the strings sound like they are using a branch instead of a bow.the canon and bells are extraordinary though. if all you are buying 1812 for is the canon shot, then by all means purchase this disc as it will not disapoint. the commentary is great too, discussing the selection of canon and bells.this CD is in extraordinary contrast to Dorati conducting Stravinsky. those recordings are fantastic and highly recommended. i would suggest purchasing any other version of 1812.0 stars for the performance. 2 stars for the commentary, canon, and bell work."
5,Wonderful,The CD came quickly just in time for a last minute gift idea. Was exactly what I was looking for.
3,Hard to make work piece square with the chisel.,"If the machined mortice is not square, it can take hours of time to make the needed adjustments by hand. You might need to send the partially completed piece to the scrap pile and start over. This model of the Delta Mortising attachment has some much need improvements of the model I purchased about a year ago. The old fence system was VERY difficult to set-up and get square with the chisel. Delta has obviously fixed many of the problems but . . . I don't think this is a viable replacement for a dedicated mortising machine unless you discard the fence and build your own Table/Fence Jig that allows you to properly support and easily adjust your work piece square with the chisel."
3,"Good tool, but not worth buying","I bought this tool with my drill press a couple years ago and have hardly used it. There is nothing wrong with it, but I find that there are several things that stop me from using it more often. The first is the setup. It takes too long and is too awkward. Personally I'd rather pop in a forstener bit into my drill press and make several passes to achieve a very good mortise - although this doesn't work if you are doing a through mortise.PROS:* Does the job it states* Much cheaper than a dedicated mortiserCONS:* Much too time consuming to set up* Has a very hard time cutting through hardwoods* Chisels seem to dull quickly"
4,"Fits 10"" Benchtop Drill press too","I purchased this mortising attachment hoping it would fit an old Rockwell Delta drill press I just bought from an estate sale. Well, it didn't fit that but just for kicks I tried it on my previous drill press, a 10"" Benchtop drill press from Delta model #DP200.It fit like a charm and worked perfectly even though this is not one of the Delta models the instructions say that the mortising attachment fits. The chisels and bits are in perfect shape and sharp. I got clean, accurately spaced mortises on my first attempt.The only reason I didn't give this product five stars is that one plastic handled threaded knob (used for fixing a workpiece holdown in place) was missing from the kit. I had another one the right size that fits my Delta Tenoning jig so it wasn't that much of a problem for me but still, it should have had all the parts when it was shipped."
3,Problem with Delta Radial Drill Press.,"The spacers that come with the unit makes it a ""one size fits all"" tool. The spacers that come with the unit did not fit my Delta Radial Drill Press. I took the unit to local VoEd School and their machine shop class made me a shim that fits. After that, the unit seems to work fine. I am only a hobby wood worker and it should be acceptable. It clearly is not a production type tool, however, for the price I consider it a good deal."
3,Needs better chisels,"I am limited on funds and space, so I thought this drill press mortising attachment would be great. It's not bad. First, I like the ease of assembly--just follow the easy to read directions, and ten minutes later you're ready to go. Set up and adjustment is also a snap. The problem lies, however, in the quality of the chisels. I was cutting one inch deep mortises in hard maple. I started to get tear out after the first five or six. So, I'd sharpen the chisels (using a diamond cone purchased from Rockler) again and again. My mortiing chisels hold an edge much longer.The fence is a bit smaller than the fence on stand-alone mortisers, but since I mainly use it for small items, it hasn't become an issue.Nevertheless, the system is easy to use and truth be told, so is sharpening. For the price, I would purchase it again. Perhaps as time passes, I will upgrade the chisels."
2,Wrong size,"The overall package seemed very good. Nice to have a case to store it, but the only problem I had was it doesn't fit my Ridgid drill press quill. It might say it fits up to a certain size, but there are only three size adapters. Be careful to check your machines diameter and radius exactly. Had to send it back and was charged $14 for it."
3,fit???,"i am still in iraq, i ordered this to go on my drill press, the dp-200 i know delta doesnt say that it fits, below some one said it did all in all ill just see if it doesnt someone let me know and i can send it to them for 10.00 less then amozon. i only gave it 3 stars for now but will update later"
1,Delta and Amazon: You've dropped the ball!,"I'm in the market for a new drill press--and thought I'd toss in this mortising attachment for good measure. The product description lists five Delta drill presses that work with the Delta 17-924 mortising attachment. None of those models is currently available for sale through Amazon. The reviews indicate that the product works with other drill presses too, but how is one to know? Looks like Delta needs to do a little updating here. (One star for ""nice try."")"
3,Definately makes square holes.,"Once it is set up, it makes great mortises with ease; once it is set up. While the setup is not difficult, it is time consuming. For me the plastic storage box is completely useless. The box is cheap and in order to be used the mortising attachment must be completely dissasembled. Also, the plastic box that came with mine seems to be made for a different version. The part number I received is 17-924 but it doesn't resemble the picture on this page and it doesn't fit the moldings in the box. It took me about 20 minutes to set up the first time and will probably take about 10 now that I've done it. Once set up it was as easy to use as any other drilling operation. To Delta's credit the manual was fairly thorough and accurate."
2,They work for a short time and cost too much. Go electrostatic.,My woodshop has the typical tools and my projects include both non-exotic and exotic woods. The AP200 works sitting on a bookcase but the outer filter clogs quickly. Since these filters run about $24 in packs of two I stopped buying them and purchased an electrostatic filter that is washable for $44 delivered from [...]
1,Too expensive,"The Delta A200 Shopmaster air filter is an excellent product, however Delta brand filters, at more than $12 each, are way too expensive! I ordered a box standard 12x24x1 furnace filters, 10 for around $32. When the filters arrived they were of equal or better quality then the Delta filters, HOWEVER, they are just slightly too large! Seems like Delta forces you to use their off-size filter, rather than an industry standard. I assume they see consumables as a high margin business.I suggest you consider another other brand air filter system, like Jet, and determine if they can use standard sized filters. If yes, DO NOT buy the Delta air filter system. In the longrun, you will save a ton of money if you can use a standard filter."
1,I did not receive the merchandise,I ordered a book on the Shroud of Turin and my credit card was billed. I paid for the book and did not receive the book. Please look into this matter. Thank you Tony
3,good,"Great coffee grinder for drip coffee makers, unfortunately no matter how carefully one removes the cover, coffee always seems to land on the counter."
2,Disappointed with grinding mess,"I bought this grinder for my office based on the enormous number of positive reviews, but now I am perplexed by them, since with me there are a couple of major problems steering this grinder to the storage closet: every time I grind coffee I make a mess of coffee grounds on my counter, in my coffee maker, and on the inside and outside of the grinder. If I pause to check whether the grind is fine enough, the twist-locking lid becomes fouled with grounds and difficult to close without cleaning with a brush all over the counter. Pouring grounds into the maker is difficult without spilling, and so many grinds remain caked inside that I have to brush and pour in again, causing more mess. I spend much more time cleaning the grinder, counter, and our coffee maker (which does not come completely clean) than I can justify. For readers who think I'm inept, I have a B&D grinder at home that does a great job."
1,Garbage!,"Lasted 7 months while being used only once a week to grind spices and coffee and now it broke! $30 down the drain! No return, no replacment, no refund, no guarantee!"
2,Note: Bowl not Stainless Steel,"I ordered this grinder for spices, and wanted to have a stainless steel bowl to avoid oxidation when grinding e.g., cloves. I did not read carefully enough, and did not realize that this grinder has stainless steel blades and exterior, but _not_ bowl. I have returned it for a Saachi SA-1440, which meets my requirements and works well and quietly, as well. I'll add that the flimsy stainless exterior had a small dent when the part arrived, reducing its aesthetic charm as well."
1,"Liked it at first, then it just stopped working",It worked very well when it was working. I hadn't used it for a month or so and then just tried today and all it did was hum.Seems that a number of other people have had the same issue. Good thing it was cheap.
2,Doesn't work as well as my old Braun,I can't figure out how to keep coffee grinds from falling all over the place after I grind. I never had that problem with my Braun. It looks good though. I basically bought it to match my Stainless appliances and it does that. Unfortunately beauty is only skin deep.
2,Grinds well....not user friendly!!,"Having been pleased with the lower-priced Krups grinder, I couldn't wait to get this one which sounded even better. First the good things: it does a great job of grining coffee and it is more quiet that the earlier model. But it is clumsy to use and difficult to get the coffee out of, makes a mess!! The very short cord can also be a problem. Stick with the original model!!"
2,Average,I had a Barista coffee grinder which I bought in a starbucks many years ago. One day it went nuts and would not turn off without unplugging it.. so it became dangerous and I bought this Krups after all the positive reviews. I would give it two and a half stars if Amazon would let me because it grinds coffee beans really well but :-[1.] its grind collection area is hopeless compared to others..the lip simply does not come up high enough so when you open the top after grinding about four table spoons of beans...grind go everywhere. This is absurd and I am very disappointed at Krups for such a sloppy piece of industrial design.[2.] the entire lid and closure lock mechanism does not work well when it has some grinds in it. Poor design I am afraid.I'll try to keep using it but it looks like it bound for Goodwill and I will get a Bodum Bistro Grinder.I will say that if you grind small amounts then this is a great (4 star) grinder.
3,Not good for fine grind,"If you need a fine grind on your coffee or spices this is not the grinder to buy. It works well if you need a coarse grind. I wanted mine for Turkish coffee for which you need a fine grind, but it just cannot do it. It might take you a very long time to get anywhere near a grind that you are looking for, but never really gets it fine. Also it gets hot very soon, and a lot of coffee ends up sticking to the sides and won't spin."
3,twice-a-day grind,"I purchased this grinder 2 months ago to replace my second burned-out Kitchen Aid coffee mill/grinder. I bought this Krups because of its name, as well as its cool look. Unfortunately, I don't like the way it functions. The top is very difficult to twist into place-- an action that must happen before the unit will grind. Furthermore, there is so much static electricity in the lid, that I always have residual coffee grinds dropping onto the counter as I remove it. There's also a sizable amount left in the chamber after I dump the grinds into the filter. Even though it was only a fraction of the fancy Kitchen Aid grinder's cost, I'm unhappy with its performance. I've already started looking for another stainless or brushed nickel grinder that I can leave on my kitchen counter."
5,Lasted 16 years,"We like fine ground coffee for our coffee maker and this one works for that (easily for coarser as well). We have had this for about 16 years of daily coffee drinking--can't believe they still have the same model, and finally it has broken and we need to replace it. Definitely recommend."
1,Messy with a short cord,I asked for this at Xmas and replaced it today. I've tried living with it for two months but I give up. The simple act of opening it loses grounds everywhere. I selected the Cuisinart with a removable cup to replace it. You can find this one at the Salvation Army.
5,great job,"I've used this for flax seeds and coffee beans, and it does a great job on both. Very fast too."
1,Poor quality,"It loooks good. But three pieces have broken off within a year. They used cheap, brittle plastic - the sort I associate with 1970. I can still use the grinder if I hold it just right and enlist the aid of a skewer. I guess it's time to buy a new Braun. My last Braun worked fine for about 15 years. I do not intend to buy any more Krups products after this experience."
1,Broke after 4 uses,"This item is not robust. After 4 uses, the internal motor jammed and the unit no longer worked. Very disappointing."
4,"Bosch was better, our former grinder.",Difficult to empty. Shape of opening is hard to match up to a round container for transfer. Coffee grinds are reluctant to leave grinder after grinding.
4,Krups Coffee Grinder,Solid grinder. Top is a bit tricky sometimes to twist in place. It's relatively quiet and grind is good.
4,"grinders, unite!","I didn't give it 5 stars just because of the way the lid closes; you have to ,,learn,, to close it properly so you will not damage it. Other than that the grinder is working really good, I'm satisfied with the purchase. If the one at $19.99 has the same motor go for that one, it probably does the same job and you get to keep the ten dollars to spend it at the mall for some other things you don't really need. Happy grinding everyone!"
4,Works great as a spice grinder,This is the second one we've owned. This grinder has no problem with any raw spice I've used in it.
4,My favoritte one Not available at store,"Clean, simple, small and good quality also easy to clean. This one is my third these 15 years. Mostly plastic lid is broken when dropped and hit. This time moter is worn out. Try to but as stores but nobdy carry this simple but high quality one. I will buy this German grinder till discontinued."
3,It's OK,"Good for the money, I guess. Not a very even grind and a pain to clean. Take into account that about a quarter of your grind will get stuck to the circumference of the bottom."
4,My wife loves it !!!,I bought this as a surprise for my wife and she loves this product. Small and useful. Does the job quite well. Neat looks and easy to use. Not that pricy as well.
1,"3 Months good service -- then jammed, unsafe, unusable","Received the grinder 3 July from Amazon. Gave three (3) months good service. Then, power switch locks in on position and cannot open to get grinds out. In addition, safety hazard, grinder starts by self if left plugged in."
2,Not a great option for spice grinding,"I received this product as a gift, as the salesperson promised that it would work great for grinding spices. It doesn't. Uneven grinding, not catching some of the spices that sit on the bottom, and others spray to the top of the cover where the blades cannot reach, and if you have to use it for longer periods of time it heats up and blanches the flavor out of the spices. The plastic top has cracked and pieces broken off so many times (but continues to partially snap into place) that the spices spray everywhere when used.I do not use this for coffee grinding, therefor I cannot give a review as to it's performance for which it is originally intended. This is only for those who do a lot of spice grinding."
5,Works Beautifully. Great buy.,"Exactly as advertised. Works beautifully, quiet operation (as compared to my last grinder), easy to operate, grinding is fast and even. I purchased this particular one because of the steel grinding blades. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants or needs a grinder."
4,Very Good Coffee Grinder.,"Bought this to replace a Burr Grinder I had. This grinder is very solid and I would recommend it. It is pretty easy to clean, and it is small so it isn't too invasive on our counter top. One downside is that you can't grind a lot of coffee at once. You can grind about 1 lb bag of beans pretty comfortably, but after that the machine gets a little hot and I worry about it breaking if I push it too much further. So, I grind my coffee in 1 lb increments, and leave it at that. 4 out of 5 stars for getting too hot and not being able to handle more grinding."
1,Terrible Design,"I gave this grinder one star because I can't give it no stars. In all fairness, it is pretty, and it does grind the coffee. However, you can't get the coffee out of it without making a mess. The lid is too short to hold a batch of ground coffee by turning it upside down. Trying to remove it from the body of the grinder is a battle, as the coffee sticks at the bottom of the grinder like it is glued into it. After using it one week, it is being retired to the storage room for emergency only use."
5,Deal of the Centruy,The Krups GX4100 has made our dreaded task of grinding herbs to powder much simplier. A fantastic deal for the money. I would recommend this product for anyone wishing to powder their home-grown herbs.
2,Too Messy,"Bought this grinder after my Capresso grinder developed a crack in the plastic housing. After using for about two weeks, I have to agree with other reviews that mention ""static problem"". The grinds cling to grinder and coffee end up all over the counter when trying to pour into coffee machine. The plastic cover also somewhat awkard to get on and off.I would not recommend this grinder."
2,Not satisfied with this product,"It grinds just fine, but when I take the lid off to pour my coffee into the filter, an overwhelming static build up sends the dry coffee grinds flying all over my counter, my hands, the floor and about anywhere else other than the filter into which I am attempting to pour them. We've had our grinder for 3 years and this Christmas have decided to toss it in the trash and ask Santa for a new coffee grinder."
2,Not Very Happy,"I have a Krups GX 4100 and have used it for a few years until recently when the little plastic peg under the swivel top cracked, then broke off rendering the unit unusable. Now I'm looking for new, better coffee grinder. As with most of the other reviewers, I also experienced the problem of static electricity spilling coffee grounds all over the counter no matter how carefully I was. I expect more from Krups."
5,Great grinder!,"Prompt arrival, fair price and the unit hums along nicely, doing exactly as I expected. My only complaint, which is unavoidable, is that static electricity causes the fine grounds to collect on the interior of the unit and then tends to topple all over the counter when I opne the lid and dispense the grounds. Goes with an electrical product, I suppose."
2,Beware- Achilles heel !,"Very disappointed. I have bought TWO of these grinders. A very small piece of plastic broke off the cap of the first one, making it inoperable! The plastic started breaking off the lip of the second one. It's a great grinder but unfortunately it has flimsy parts."
4,surprise,"I never heard before about this release; but this is from around his best era..night&day, body&soul. If you have those (and jumpin jive ofcourse) then this might be a good next one to purchase....although it is somewhat below par compared to his other output in this era."
4,Lost Treasure,I have this album(yes I mean album) and it was one of his better but less well known albums
4,An imporant overview of specific reading challenges,"This book is a keystone work for anyone who works with children who struggle with basic reading skills. There is a LOT of memorization involved with the list of sight words. However, there are a great number of other important reading tools. Further, Nanci Bell is a recognized expert in visual imagery and the importance of this skill to reading. If your child (or student) does not seem to get the concept of letters, this book is a must."
2,Not Flexible.,"I purchased the entire Seeing Stars Kit when an educational psychologist recommended I use it to work with one of her clients. The program is packaged with lots of goodies. However, I found it completely inflexible. I am used to customizing materials to use with individual students who have very individual needs. This kit was more ""one size fits all"" and was a complete waste of my money."
4,Just Gimme Somethin' I'm Used To,"I found this cassette in the sale bin of the local college. I love it. In fact, I've nearly worn it out. Imagine sitting in the parlor of Norman and Nancy's House (before they split of course) on a rainy Georgia evening. They are there picking and singing, and you are simply listening. They play vintage instruments, ancient numbers, or one's Norman wrote that just sound ancient. I have a numerous discs by Norman and Nancy and this is my favorite. Mr. Garfield's been shot way down low. See if you can keep yourself from singing along with that one!"
5,Odor-B-Gone!,"I tried this product to neutralize urine odor in the yard, on the dog's favorite spot. It really works, gets rid of odors completely."
4,It works.,Gets rid of all urine smells in parents bathroom who are elderly and have been sick. Used twice and each time I clean their floor.
2,Odor Mute - NOT,"So far I have not had success with this product. I have used it on old spots that I used other products on and that may be the reason. Thankfully, I haven't had any new spots."
4,Good product,This product works well. The only negative comment I would make is that it doesn't all dissolve and there is a grit in the bottom of the bottle.
4,Good comprehensive history,"I enjoyed the book because it is a good comprehensive history of optics, binoculars, and telescopes. Plus, the price was great."
1,Dumbfounded,I can hardly believe that a book that originally sells for 11.99 would sell for over 200 dlls used.
3,"Great performance, terrible recording ~","I think this is a fine performance. The issue I have is that there is a lot of static and hiss on this recording (it is a 1960s recording). Mercury apparently does not have the technology to reduce the noise level like DG, RCA, EMI, or Decca. This is a sad state because this is a wonderful performance of an uncommon piece (The Schumann I refer to).My choice?Tchaikovsky, Wienawski, Brahms, Schumann: Violin ConcertosIt is a far better recording and Bell does this piece (and the others) justice."
4,Good music; great violin playing,"Though Henryk Szeryng never achieved the fame accorded to many other 20th century violinists, he was equal or superior to them all in technical ability and unsurpassed in artistry. All of the performances on this CD are outstanding. If I'm not mistaken, Szeryng's recording of the Schumann concerto was the first ever made, as this concerto was unavailable for decades and only rediscovered in the 20th century. It still equals or surpasses any performance of this concerto subsequently recorded.The four star rating refers to the uneven quality of some of the compositions; Szeryng's performances definitely rate five stars."
5,Intriguing read about the USA's best paraplegic athlete.,"Kevin Saunders' is arguably the greatest paraplegic athlete. The winner of two bronze medals in the past Olympics, Saunders' story -- beginning with the horrific grain elevator explosion that snapped his spine -- through his triumphant sprint to the finish line is a pretty good read. Saunders is no paper hero: he screws up along the way and occasionally gets involved in a laugh-out-loud funny situation. But the main thrust is the motivational message -- you CAN do this. And there's ALWAYS a way. A good afternoon read for teen-agers or adults."
3,Sam Cooke's Greatest Hits,"How can you have a ""Sam Cooke's Greatest Hits"" and omit ""Another Saturday Night""? The omission of that one song for the inclusion of songs like ""Red Rooster"" and ""Frankie and Johnny"" is the reason that I gave this 3 stars. Those songs were not chart-busters like ""Another Saturday Night."" Just a bad choice by RCA.It just shows that the companies want to you go and buy the greatest hits and the ""other cd"" that contains that one song that should have been on it to begin with! It is all about money and marketing."
3,Almost Perfect But......,"Any Sam Cooke compilation WITHOUT the CLASSIC 'A Change Is Gonna Come' is deemed incomplete, so the CD loses two stars automatically.There's enough space left on the CD for at least 4-5 more tracks, so what's the excuse ??My Verdict-Nice intro to the late & GREAT Sam Cooke, but a more comprehensive anthology (in single CD format) needs to be released ASAP!!"
2,another misguided collection,"Not one reviewer has bothered to mention the absence here (and everywhere) of ""Another Saturday Night"" -- nor its cause, which I won't bother to mention. Neither was it included in the previous ""Best Of"" cd (as I discovered belatedly), or in any other Cooke collection, domestic or import (despite track listings at other web sites which erroneously include the song). This would be less annoying were that particular greatest hit (sic transit gloria the english language) available SOMEWHERE... An enterprising compiler could include it on ""Out-of-print's Greatest Hits""? But then it wouldn't be out-of-print any more. . ."
4,Classic,"This is a classic must have for anyone who loves motown oldies, as I do. His voice is so smooth and effortless."
3,Bad track on Sweet Sixteen,"This has all of Sam's great numbers and is generally a good album except the quality on one single track. Unfortunately the problem is for one of his greatest hits [""Sweet Sixteen'] where there is a very noticable issue on the left speaker. When this track was re-recorded for stereo they had a problem and never bothered to correct it so one of his best songs got trashed."
4,Acceptable...but lacking.,"Sure, it covers a lot of the big hits. However, it utterly pales in comparison to the RCA disc ""The Man And His Music""...which is horribly out of print. I picked it up in 1996 or so. Best fifteen bucks I ever spent.You can still pick it up used here or on ebay, but you'll pay for the priviledge, but its still well worth the money. Pass this by and get the real deal. A Sam Cooke disc without 'Another Saturday Night' and 'A Change Gonna Come' isn't much of a Sam Cooke disc."
3,Not Good Enough,This greatest hits is ok but your better off getting Portrait Of A Legend because this album doesn't have Change Is Gonna Come or songs from Sam and his old group. So save some money and get Portrait Of A Legend and not this you'll be happy that you did.
5,Sam Cooke,A good quality CD of songs from a great artist in my long ago past. The artist died too young but left some good memories.
3,Learning something,I got this disc and didn't realize how many tunes Sam cooke really had. This is an awesome disk. It is chocked full of great music. I love to put it on and let it play all the way through.
5,It's called Greatest for a REASON,"Like always, Sam Cooke delivers a sweet smooth velvety cruning that I just love. I think anyone who likes that old 50S-60s cruning sound will love it too. I t has all his best songs."
5,great CD,"A great CD. I'm from a younger generation that this music, but I couldn't be happier with the CD."
3,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"This compilation is completely worthless. The SACD ""Portrait of a Legend"" has long since eclipsed this unforgivable compilation of The Great Sam Cooke. It is completely unessential. There is no musical representation from Sam's glorious gospel days nor his ambitious and wonderfully risk taking final days. I can't believe this is even in print. People may say ""Oh its just for casual Sam Cooke fans or for those who would like to start getting into his music."" I don't even think there is a such thing as a ""casual"" Sam Cooke fan! The best inroduction to Sam is ""Portrait of a Legend"" and from there get ""Keep Movin' On"" ""Live at Harlem Square"" ""At The Copa"" ""Sam Cooke with The Soul Stirrers"" and the flawless ""Night Beat."" From there seek out the three box sets and then songs and albums that can only be found on vinyl. This would have received zero stars but Sam's voice is so transcendent it makes up for every flaw I described. :o)"
2,No officer or figurine and ones we have are too small to fit motorcycle.,"My son loved this at first, but upon realizing that there is no officer, I told him we would use of the one hundred or so figurines we have. NONE OF THEM FIT on the motorcycle as it's bit and even his big wrestler figurines are too short. Also, when you hit button for bike to move on its own, it moves about 5 inches then stops. I went on the web site to find an officer that fit and they have no figurines listed. OVerall, i would not recommend it."
1,No response to my query about the item I received.,"Highly disturbed that I did not receive a response to my query that the color did not match the photo, but I should have read more carefully in the add that the color may not be the one received. I did however ask why the hood of the car was a different color than the rest of the car, alas no response. Poor customer relations. Will not purchase from again."
3,Lots of photos but not enough information,"This book is a small book about perfume bottles. I feel that the author wrote as best as she could about the topic but the book is not extensive enough into history, etc. for it to be a true ""guide"". The book was intended to help a collector in purchasing perfume bottles but I felt there was not enough information on what to look for, how to tell if the bottle is truly an antique, how to value or grade a bottle, places to find bottles, etc. This book barely touches the surface of the knowledge that is needed for a person to be able to collect bottles without getting one that is not what the person really wanted or paid for."
3,OK CD,"Just not what I expected, but ok for the price. I thought I knew more of the songs on it but all I knew was Alices' Restaurant"
4,Classic Arlo,"The only thing missing is ""Deportee,"" a song that his father originally wrote and one of my all time favorites."
4,Ario Guthrie Greatest Hits,i got this cd i like the Alice's Restaurant Massacree they play this song only on thanksgivingonly two that day at 12 am and 12 pm
5,this cd is a great piece of musical talent,all of the songs on this cd are great especially CITY OF NEWORLEANS. Arlo tells a great story through all of his songs and they are a joy to listen to.
3,Not my favorite collection,"Although this album has many of my favorite Arlo Gutherie songs, the Alice's Restaurant cut was much to to long and seemed out of place with the other songs in the collection. Maybe I have out grown Alice's Restaurant???"
3,Arlo,Arlo is tons of fun but I can only take the long winded monologes every so often.More music and less talk would be good.
2,one good track,"It was so whimsically cool & cute when I loved it in the sixties. Now it seems superficial self indulgent drivel - particularly the overlong Alice's Restaurant. Buy the single track of the still great ""City of New Orleans"" and save yourself some money."
2,Can't play it often,"I remember the massacree with fondness and joy. Now, I wince. The smug self-assurance of the 60s come out in spades, and I'm sorry I ascribed to such pomposity. Arlo's voice is weaker than I remember too. I was better off just living in the past rather than attempting to revisit it."
3,Sci Fi,Couldn't really get into this movie. Just didn't push my buttons. Probably would not recommend to anyone to this movie before viewing.
4,Great movie,This is a really cool movie. Stunning set design. Like nothing else I've seen. Very original. Good story. Yeap!
5,"Wierd and trippy, but great","This is definitely a French film. It's very surreal and the first time I watched it I had a little trouble following who was doing what and why. After a few more times though I've got it all straight and, believe it or not, it does all make sense.I'm a big fan of Ron Perlman (as is anybody who's seen Hellboy most likely) and he's wonderful in this. The entire cast is compelling and a joy to watch, even if you're confused. I especially loved Daniel Emilfork as a very sad bad guy.This is probably not the movie for those who don't like quirky humor and surreal visuals, but I loved it. The special effects never look phony but always fit the situation."
5,Watched it twice in one night,"I rented this to test out the DVD Player on my PC, and I found that I had to reformat my hard drive to get the DVD Player to work.It was worth it. The story and the imagery were so amazing, the characters so compelling that I watched right over again (I never do that).The performances were amazing -- Perlman's simple sailor/strongman, the Clones, Krank, The twin sisters (Octopus), the children, especially Miette. Gaultier's costumes were subdued (for him), but so perfect for this film.If it weren't for the likes of Jeunet and Caro, I'd been thinking about writing off French cinema. Maybe it's not too late."
3,"Visually a masterpiece, script lacks a little though.","A beautiful set and costumes give this film its dark and haunting appeal. The entire movie seems as though it was created for arts sake. Metal, darkness, and wires is what the set and the costumes of this movie are all about. It is all very fantastic. It personally reminds me of Tim Burton's film and set design. It truly is a visual haunt.The script and the acting is not in the same league as the set though. The script and plot are at times confusing and filled with holes. The acting is sometimes over done and not truly believable. However, the movie does have some very rewarding scenes that are both well directed and acted.This movie is worth checking out. It is a visual masterpiece and although the script isn't to fantastic it is quite a good movie. It is almost a modern day fairy/horror tale. Worth a watch or two."
4,.,"In terms of visual atmosphere, dynamic aesthetics, sheer imagination, and artistically inspirational qualities, this gets 4 stars. The only things keeping it down from the 5 star mark are the occasionally nerve-grating wackiness and the general incoherence of the storyline. The story that *is* there is fairly interesting, but I can certainly say that if Jeunet and Caro put as much into the script and the development of the characters as they did the production design, this might well be the greatest movie ever made. Not that the characters don't work, to an extent, and not that the story doesn't; it's just irritatingly chaotic and intangible at times. Still a must-see. Beware the dubbed version."
3,"lavish scenes, banal acting","Save for a couple of interesting set designs, this movie would've been a total waste of money. The acting is painfully mediocre (supporting cast) if not downright horrible (ron perlman).The screenplay does not draw the viewer in and mosty resembles a heavy bag of of BORING.This movie would be most enjoyable on mute."
2,Deceived,I was deceived into buying this movie after seeing that many reviewers had given it five stars.Five stars! Not really! The movie is slow and the story doesn't make any sense. However. I gave it two stars beacuse at least the main characters' acting wasn't too bad.
1,Laideur absolue! (absolute ugliness),"This was one of the French films I bought for the purpose of learning French but after watching this horrible... thing, I have even reconsidered learning French! In fact I'm amazed for the unbelievable number of reviews giving 5 star rating of this absolute ugliness! I feel really sorry for those who might be DECEIVED by this big number of good reviews."
1,............,this movie stinks.the french seriously do not know how to make movies.For me to go on about the movie would be a total waste of time.junk!
5,Better than Delicatesson... A true masterpiece,"I had the great honor of seeing this film a few years ago when it was on it's first run in American theaters. I was captivated by the very surreal and dark look of the sets as well as the plot. The look and feel of the movie remiend me of the works by former Monty Python brain, Terry Gilliam (12 monkeys, Brazil, Time Bandits, Baron Munchausin). This movie is definatly worth your time and money, but only see the subtitled version. If you like this, I also recommend Delicatesson (By the same directors), it is kind of hard to find, but if you find a copy buy it, or rent it."
2,More Weird than Wonderful,"I generally enjoy weird, off-center movies. My relatively modest collection of about 30 DVDs includes Brazil, Dark City, 12 Monkeys and Donnie Darko. So when Amazon's algorithm recommended City of Lost Children, I hiked on over to the local video emporium and rented it. I was not entranced.The sets are wild and wonderful. The characters are certainly unique. But somehow, the movie just didn't work for me. Slow pacing and an almost non-existent storyline made it hard for me to sustain any interest. The Dickens-meets-Gilliam atmosphere eventually palled. Finally, about halfway through, I gave up."
3,surreal,"This film was very artistic and more surreal than anything! I did not understand it fully, and anyone who has watched it who comprehends it, please tell me! I have watched DELICATESSAN also and knew that they had to have the same director. I love surreal artsy missunderstood movies such as these. The plot that I did understand fascinated me, it was like a childhood nightmare."
3,Flawed film saved by a 10 year old girl,"I almost pulled the plug on this critically acclaimed French fantasy from 1995. The Felliniesque style of narrative was driving me nuts. Something about some weirdo not being able to dream, so he kidnaps young kids to steal theirs. Even with an English dub, it didn't make any sense. At about the 40 minute mark, things got a bit quieter on screen and I could focus on the terrific sets and color (or lack of, more appropriately).Then all of a sudden this brilliant 10 year old girl takes over the picture. The girl is beautiful and a wonderful actress and her presence overcomes the silliness of the story. Played by Judith Vittet she apparently disappeared from the scene after making this film and another in the same year. IMDb shows she made some appearances on French TV but no more movies. Wow, what a loss. I can't get all gooey about this movie but the visuals and this young French actress are worth watching."
5,Stimulating,"Buyer beware, this film is not for the light hearted not the dim witted. Darkness wrought, this film mixes a delightful solution of French noir with the apokoliptic feel of The Crow:City of Angels."
4,STUNNING!,I seen this movie when I went on vacation in Montreal on a french channel and watched it from beginning to end and was instatntly in the hunt to get a copy for my library. The effects in this film are very very good but the story has a weak grip to the viewer and should have offered a bit of more emotional weight. Still if you have a chance to see this film I suggest you do!
2,"This movie is great, the dubbing sucks!","Ok, the movie is wonderful, but please, please please, do not buy the dubbed version. They didn't get the actors to do their own voices, and well, it leaves so much to be desired. Get the subtitled version! Get the subtitled version! It's got all the depth and wonder that you need."
3,Different,"This film isn't your typical movie! Althought I didn't like it, I know many people who love it. I'm glad that I did watch it b/c the characters are very interesting. The movie is frightening and made me think way too much!"
2,Disappointing,"From the duo that made the visually innovative and exhilarating Delicatessen, the City of Lost Children exhibits the same ability to translate dreams to the screen, share a poetic and original vision, as shown since in Alien Resurrection and Amelie. Ultimately though, this movie is a disappointment : poor dialogues, and, mostly, a wholly predictable plot. A fairy tale it is, a visual treat no doubt, but lacking of a compelling story."
3,what did they do to this film,it's strange how it's possilbe to take a film with such beatiful visuals as this and destroy it with a third rate dubbing. dubbing is the spawn of all evil. this film was so much more efective in french even though i don't understand a word they say. the subtittles do it just fine. if you can get a copy of the subtittled film add two more stars to this review and fall in love with one of the most amazing films ever made. also check out delicatesen!!!!
5,a dream a nightmare a fantasy a masterpiece,"This movie is film making at its best. The cinematography is mind-blowing and the costumes, music and acting was well thought through. All the characters even the extras were awesome. Dominique Pinon as the clones was a hilarious and likable character, and Judith Vittet as Miete was an absolute doll. Ron Perlman was good as a strong but somewhat dumb circus performer. This movie's highlights were the special effects and scenery. They were excellent. This film put me through a different feeling as i watched it and i immediatly became addicted. It is a wonderful piece of art that belittles those dumb poorly acted teen movies and boring romantic comedies that you see in the movies and on television day by day. The City of Lost Children gave me a reason to appreciate the art of movie making again. I thank Jeunet and Caro and everyone who was involved in the film for making something beautiful and worth watching."
5,Incredible Images on film,"This movie has one of the best atmosphears ever, scenary, Color's, Images, Caracters and city's created in this film are a dream. A real artistic inspiration."
4,Great but not as great as DELICATESSEN.,"This is a great film. However I have seen there earlier work and think the brothers were slackin here. DELICATESSEN is by far there best stuff, but lost children is not far behind."
4,Dream like state...,"This movie is gothic eye candy, dreamy, the stylized world created is worth viewing alone. The characters, themes, moods and ambience are all quite pretty. From there it falls slightly into loquatiousness, not to be a pick d**k. Not a perfect film but how many are? There is much to commend, though the ""Muscle Man's French"" isn't one of them. Weak...too scripted? Maybe just plain sucky. At any rate, lots to think about here and to admire with your peepers. Lose yourself in a mesmerizing world and don't dissect, I already did it for you....HAHAPeace, morado.org"
5,Incredible Movie,its just one of those movies that will entertain your brain.and youll end up showing all your friends.
2,A Two Handed Movie,"This is definitely a two handed movie. On the one hand, the relationship between One and Miette is beautifully wrought, the sets and art direction are fabulous, the evil Siamese twin sisters are deliciously over the top. (Judith Vittet in the role of Miette is especially noteworthy in that she plays a strong, forceful child without a touch of saccharine. Truly a great performance.) And there is one sequence in which the power of a single tear in a sympathetic universe to stop evil is brilliantly played out.On the other hand the central plot, a mad scientist who steals the dreams of children with a wife who is a midget and who has seven identical sons, is a terrible hash. Who these people are, why they are the way they are, what their relation to their world is (for instance, where do they get the resources to buy stolen children?) is never addressed.The mushiness of central plot keeps this very interesting movie from being more, than ""interesting"
4,Whether you seek inspiration or just like 'Roots Music' ...,"... this is the CD for you! Beautiful, beautiful material, with some of the most influential performances in the Gospel music canon selected. The liner notes alone are like a crash course in Gospel music history. You don't have to be a Christian to be moved by these songs of hope, struggle, and redemption. Though the second CD in this series (TGGW, Vol. II) edges out Vol. I as my favorite, Vol I has gotten me through some tough life-passages *and* enhanced my appreciation of a great American art form! The CD has been a mainstay in my stereo since I received it as a gift from a close friend of mine four years ago.... Whether you're a longtime Gospel fan or someone who has always wanted to explore the history of the musical form that gave birth to everything from Blues to Folk to Rock-n-Roll, you owe it to yourself to buy this CD!"
1,Save your Money!,"This gadget will work fine if you're drilling in something like thin baseboard molding, etc. or other light weight stuff. Any thing heavier than a 2x4 you can forget about decent support. You have to make an allowance on the height of your support to compensate for the swag you are going to get because of the weight. I wish I had bought a floor support stand instead."
2,needs work to make work,Assembled and put on drill press; the arms that have the rollers attached weren't high enough to clear the stock that was in the vice attached on top of the drill press table. consequently had to make an alteration by welding three quarters inch square stock onto the existing arm to lengthen. Would I buy it again? NO!
3,Good value,"I bought the unit for a guest room of our bed and breakfast inn, so the features I got for the relative cost was the driving factor. The picture is good and the remote control is relatively simple. I feel I got good value for my money, and I would buy one again for one of our guest rooms. If it were for myself, I probably would spend more for a higher-end model."
4,Very nice tv,i think this tv is a very good buy. it has very good picture with he component inputs hooked up to my 360. i overall think this tv is very good. recommended by me and my best friend
1,"Do not ever, EVER buy this TV","I bought this TV a year ago from Best Buy. At first, I was greatly impressed. The picture was great, the sound quality was great, it was turning out to be a great buy.Now, however, the TV shuts off randomly, sometimes within seconds of turning it on. I took it to Best Buy, but the warranty had expired, only parts were covered. They wanted half the initial cost of the TV to fix it WITHOUT the parts. I declined.For those of you who have the money to recycle televisions every year, then buy this TV. Those of you who are looking for a long-term investment, however, should look elsewhere!"
1,Beware of Hidden Shipping Costs,"Shipping and handling cost me $44 dollars. This only gets this to your curbside and not into your apartment. This was for my disabled uncle who cannot move a 100 lb tv. There are NO steps up to the Elevatored apartment building, but they shipper still wouldn't do it. Contacted Tech Depot and they said it was their standard procedure, but no where on Amazon does it state CURBSIDE shipping only. I filed a claim against Office Depot which is still pending.I ended up paying the shipper (Pilot Air) $25 cash to bring the TV up. Very unfair practice and Office Depot needs to state this CLEARLY on all of their items that they are selling."
5,Kaboom!! WOW!,"If you like big sound,then stop looking! Super power Bass. You will need a power supply and inverter for this bad boy. I find the radio very good. I have a distant station I love and many other radios cant't pick it up,but the Kaboom does it well. This unit CRANKS love it."
5,Loving it.,We purchased this item for Father's Day so that Dad could listen to his Frank Sinatra CD's on his deck while grilling/during dinner. But the biggest users have been our teens and twenty-somethings who plug in their i-pods and play it on the dock all day long. It is large but has great sound and portability. We are delighted.
2,Bad Sound Quality,"I am very disappointed in the sound quality, am actually looking to re-sell the system. This machine can produce enough volume to be painful in close range, but (at least in the large gymnasium where I tried it) the volume drops very quickly as you move further away. And I don't know exactly how to describe it, but the sound is not satisfying - it's like some range of tones is missing. Yes, there's bass, and you can hear the overall piece that's being played, but the nuance in the middle just isn't there. Have you ever eaten food that's beautiful but tastes like nothing? This is the sonic equivalent."
5,The Summit Live is the best cd I own....,"...for those who have heard it, there is no need for me to explain. For those who haven't--what are you sitting around for?!?!?! Get this cd!!!"
5,wonderful,"This is one of the best cd's I have ever heard, maybe the best. Sinatra, Dino, and Sammy sound great. Just a must have cd."
5,Outstanding!,"Forget the nit-picky comments you may read here, if you are a fan of any of the artists on this album, buy it! The recording is of very high quality, and I agree with another review, vacuum tube amplification makes the vocals even better. The banter between the artists in between the musical numbers is a real treat for fans too young to experience these shows live. One other observation, if you buy this not having a HUGE appreciation for Sammy already, you will be blown away by his talent. ..thanks to Sinatra family for releasing this disc. Hopefully many more are forthcoming."
2,Not as good as the Villa Venice put out by the Jazz Hour,I agree with the San Francisco fan. This version of one of the Villa Venice concerts has absolutely no punch to it. The pack wasn't having as much fun and the orchestra was not as lively as the Jazz Hour version. Major disappointment! Forget this one pallies.
3,Nothing that special really...,"It's really amazing to see how much steam salsa lost from the 70's to the 80's. This album is the epitome of this downfall, not only commercially, but musically also. This is not to say ""Clave del Sabor"" is bad, although it's not exactly good either. ""Galera Tres"", ""Rebeca"", and the tribute to Ismael Rivera are the only songs here worth listening to since the rest are just plain bland in my opinion. The album really lacks the hard hitting spark of its predecessors like ""En Fa Menor"" or most of his earlier work. You can't really say there's a memorable song on this album."
4,Never Tire of This One!,"Have the LP but wanted to add this ""classic"" album to my iTunes library. Brings back memories...if you enjoy Ismael Miranda, this should be part of your collection."
3,Alright,"This book is has been both helpful and not so helful. The benefits are that there are many little insights and experiences the pastor informs the reader that can be very helpful in thoughts about marriage. However, the writer writes this book on a theological approach to marriage and this is where, I, being a conservative christian cannot agree on every issue. He does try to be objective on issues on marriage by giving some good background and history to everything related to marriage but his conclusions and scriptural interpretation is biased towards his church or modern times. Again there are many good things in this book that I never knew about in approaching marriage, but I needed some discernment and careful review when the writer gave his exegesis and application of scripture. I guess this caused me to have an even more closer study on what scripture has to say about marriage."
2,green thumb for real,These gloves protect your wrists but the green die bleeds through them. after a day of sweaty work your hands turn green!!! no so fun. i'd pay the extra $$ for natural-color rose gloves if i had a 2nd chance-
5,Awesome anime!,"A dark anime, focusing on the very real problems in America today. Loads of violence and sex, how can you go wrong? :)"
4,Great Series,This Show is great lot's of sex and violence more of a comedy than a drama because its so over the top. Only i wish it would come out on dvd

1,terrible support for canada users,Good luck getting a replacement cable when yours fails in a few days. They do not support canadian customers. Brutal.
3,"""Pro"" version compared to ""regular"" version.","I ordered the ""regular"" TripleFi 10's as an upgrade to my SuperFi 5 Pros and was very disappointed in the high frequencies of the new 10's. My older 5 Pros sound better. Has anyone compared the TripleFi 10 Pros against the standard TripleFi 10's? There is a hugh difference in price. Is there a huge difference in sound quality? I'm about to return the TripleFi's I just got as I know I would never use them unless they were my only pair.I am a professional musician and have been using the 5 Pros on stage for four years and love them. I was looking for an upgrade or at least a back up pair but the 10's are disappointing.Rich"
2,BAD,"These were great until a few days ago when the right earphone tweeter stopped working!!!! I lost my receipt, so UE won't accept an RMA! So, I've just been screwed out of $350...joy. Do not buy these if you value your wallet."
2,"Too small, didn't fit","The sizes for this coat run really small so my husband, who normally wears a large, had to return it for an Extra Large. The only problem being that there is no Extra large. The return was handled efficiently, however, and the customer service was good."
3,"An odd, but revealing film","The Last King of Scotland revived my interest in Amin and stimulated memories of a man considered to be a monster. This film has a way of recreating the reality of Amin and his times. He was certainly a horrible person, but this film humanizes him a bit and gives a different perspective and context. It is worth watching, but the music is awful."
2,a propaganda film gone wrong.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Barbet Schroeder's film, a ""self-portrait"" of the infamous Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, generated much controversey and even death threats. Idi Amin himself demanded that Schroeder remove particular scenes from the film under the threat of killing french citizens living in Uganda.The film is well written but almost appears sympathetic to Amin.The DVD only has an interview with director Barbet Schroeder for a special feature, although the liner notes contain a transcript of a letter Amin write requesting the deletion of particular scenes.This film has significance, but is not a good one."
1,Stick to BBC documentaries,To me the documentary is very ameturely done + don't think the French know how to compile a documentary + I think it only best to get documetaries done by BBC as you can never go wrong.
5,The Feasts of the Lord God's Prophetic Calendar,I have bought several of these for gifts. The information is so good and the illustrations are beautiful. I had never realized how the Feasts were related to the Savior.
5,The Feasts Of The Lord God's Prophetic Calendar From Calvary To The Kingdom,Excellent Book! Beautifully illustrated and packed with historical and practical information on the Feasts and Seasons of God given to the Jewish people and applicable to Christian believers today. I highly recommend this resource!
4,The Feasts of The Lord God's Prohetic Calendar From Calvary to The Kingdom,"The authors did a great job providing a teaching of the feasts from Jewish traditions and how to understand the significant role those teachings play as the fulfillment of prophecy for the Christian believer.This book is useful for the individual that seeks to learn more, but can be used in a study group as well. The Feasts of The Lord God's Prophetic Calendar will remain a part of my personal reference library for a long time."
5,An Exellent Book,I was looking for a book that presented a good perspective concerning the Jewish Holidays along with Jewish beliefs. Mostly interested in the parallels to Christianity. I was willing to put a lot of research and study into compiling for myself a complete understanding concerning this subject. This book does it all.A must read for those interested in Bible Prophecy.
5,great informative book,"very good read. Helps to put old testament celebrations and history together so one can understand what it's all about. Tells how they came about and how they have changed through time. Most of all it shows Gods purpose and plan and how it all fits so neatly together. God does things for a reason. It's never random. This book shows how the festivals lead up to Jesus, how he fulfills the first four and will fulfill the last three with his second coming. Follows scripture and explains traditions. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
3,Much Better than Booker!!,"Of the two best selling, this is the better work but it's not as specific in literal fulfillment as I hoped. The Jewish menus were nice but just added fluff for the serious scholar.The best place I found on the web if you want the meaty scholastic information on the Feasts of the Lord is:[...]"
1,Clarke cast iron bench grinder stand,"This stand is a piece of junk. It sounds like the same POS that someone else reviewed with a different name. It has a pipe in the middle that is attached like a christmas tree stand except it only has 2 bolts at the top and bottom each 120deg apart. This means when you tighten them it cocks it to one side and is still loose and wobbles. Also it is only 30"" from floor to the top of the deck, unlike 36"" to the top of my bench. You could build a better stand from a cinder block, a 4x4 and a piece of plywood. I already packed this piece of junk back up and called to have it sent back. Also, I could tell this item had already been returned once before. I didn't see the christmas tree style bolt attachments in the picture but don't be fooled like I was."
3,Krups FSD3 Juicer,"Excellent while it works; but, as with all products using plastic gears, it didn't last very long. They probably took it off of the market..or should ."
5,Definitive Bartok Recording,"Yehudi Menuhin's impassioned performance is as artistically sensitive as it is virtuostic. After this recording, most other interpretations seem lacking. While many brilliant violinists have recently championed this monumental concerto, seldom do they match Menuhin's soulful lyricism. Antal Dorati is equally sensitive with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. Bartok fans should consider this a ""must have"" recording. This is truly one of my favorite records of all time.Sincerely,John Reager"
5,Still the finest,"After 43 years, this still sounds like it was recorded last week.After doing side-by-side comparisons, Menuhin's later attempt, also with Dorati, is scrabbly and and tense.This session lasted from midnight to five a.m. before the subway started running, but you'd never know it--the Minneapolis Symphony, always a crack outfit, sounds as if it had just come in from breakfast to start a day's work. The string tone, carefully matched in bowing and character to the soloist, is especially telling.You must have this in any representative collection on many representative fronts."
4,I like these dvd's,"I like these dvd's better than Hp's. I have used these for several home movies and tv shows i have burned. They play just fine in my dvd player. I would say give them a try, but keep in mind they may not work in all dvd players. Not all blank dvd's work in all players."
1,What was I thinking!,"The concept of a charcoal filter clearing the air while using solvents sounds nice, but in practice it is ineffective and expensive. I used mine while working with contact cement and now the thing smells like contact cement. I suspect it is saturated, and without any way to purge it, is no longer any good. Additionally, while working I was much closer to the contact cement than was the filter, so whatever got to the filter had to pass by me first. Well, I also wore a charcoal filter mask and I think that is the way to go. You only filter what you breath and the filter is between the solvent and you--a much cheaper and effective solution. I would put my money there not in this device."
5,"""Sensitive guys who play old outdated tunes""; what a treat!","I have all three of the original vinyl LP albums and thought I'd never get to hear these wonderful tunes again when my turntable broke and I switched to CDs. Crumb & Company complain in their self-mocking Suits Crybaby Blues: ""Nobody likes our music, they all want stuff that's loud"". Whatever the market may be, this music makes my soul soar. It's not ""Camp"", that 60s fad where truly bad pop culture was held up as unconscious self-parody. These multi-talented, multimedia artists lovingly render these obscure, high-spirited and quaintly corny echoes from a more innocent era. Naive, a bit goofy, and even somewhat racist in an innocent way ( ""Sing Song Girl"" portrays cartoonish orientals)this music evokes the enthusiastic rowdiness of an America on a binge. Much like R. Crumb's comix, the stuff may be a bit politically incorrect and even grotesque, but it is raucously entertaining."
2,Nice concept,"The black plastic case holds the shot cups, but does not stay on the flask & the flask itself leaks all the way around the bottom. Need to take it to a jeweler and see if they can solder it."
3,Bueno para lo que pague.,"He tenido mejor suerte con otros productos que he comprado en amazon, el reloj no es feo, es bastante comodo y liviano, pero tiene la apariencia de un swach swiss por el cuerpo de aluminio, la verdad prefiero mi Caterpillar que es mas robusto ya que este parece de juguete."
1,TimeZone123 NEVER AGAIN!!!,"I ordered a Swiss Army Men's Original watch #24506The watch arrived used, scratched and dirty; they didn't even bother to wipe off the sweat from whomever used it before. Shame on this vendor."
1,"ordered a new watch, received a used watch","Very disappointing as this was to be a gift. The watch arrived with a filty band, and the back of the watch was severaly scratched. The company did not respond in a timely manner and I had to contact Amazon for help. But the company did refund my money."
3,Swiss Army 24506 (Unisex Watch) : Analog/Digital Quartz,"Excellent Swiss army watch.It was my gift of the father's day that I did to my husband. He is very happy with his new ""toy.""Item as described shipped and packed wellThank you."
3,Not All That and a Bag of Chips,I'm giving this book a very generous three stars. The book was more like a soap opera. The story drug out and it would never end. I honestly thought the story could have been told with no more than two hundred pages. The story really wasn't too realistic. How many African American men out there will share a woman... no true brother would share a woman. The only thing I liked about the book was the character Craig. There is a sequel to this book coming out in June and I hope that Craig finds true love and get over Venice.
3,All That And??????,"I found this to be a bag full of air. The characters could have had more substance. Jarvis and Craig were difintely ficticous, I have yet to meet one brother that would have tolerated Venices inability to make a decision. I would have like to have seen the males decipted as stronger brothers. I would have loved to see an ended where the men got balls and went on to bigger and better things leaving Venice assed out."
2,All That And A Bag of Chips,This book was soooo long. There is no way that an African-American man would share his girlfriend with another man. And what was going on in the dream sequence? There were way too many details and the story went on and on and on. This book is not a good read for anyone over 40. Do not waste your money.
2,Unrealistic fantasy,"I must admit I read the whole book in just a few days because I wanted to see how it all turned out and I will probably read the sequel. However, I did find it to be rather unrealistic, a true fairy tale. This could never really happen. So if you're looking for an escape from reality with a girl that has it all-it's a good read."
3,Is this real?,"I found this book a little disturbing. Is this what really goes on in college? I've never attended college so I wouldn't know, however, I do know that it makes me think twice about my sons going off to college. As far as my opinion is concerned, this book was a lot of unprotected sex by teenagers. Remember, this is only MY opinion."
2,not all that,"This book is really a 2.5 star rating to me. The plot was too predictable, and the writing was much too elementary. I had to force myself to finish this book, which by the way I still haven't and I have owned the book for 5wks now. Normally I go through a good book in no more than 3 days. This is a book I would borrow from someone, not purchase."
1,All That And A Bag Of Chips,"You can tell this was a novels first book. The story just never developed. The Character Venice was very confused,spoiled and everyone praised her. No one wanted to tell her she was wrong for sleeping with two guys at the same time. I would not recommed this book to teenagers. No grown up adult would get anything out of reading this book. Sex doesn't make a relationship. I get the feeling the author wants us to think sex makes a relationship."
3,It's okay,"This book was okay. I found it to be immature for myself. College life for anyone can be confusing, but this was a little much. I think a younger audience can relate to this novel more than a person who is past their college years, married, with children etc..... I will read the second novel, just to complete the saga between Venice, Craig and Jarvis."
3,Too long,"This book was o.k., but it was way to long.You already knew what was going to happen. And Venice was not all that,there is noway she could have strung along two men like that for that long period of time.Jarvis was the love of her life ansd Craig was just a distraction from not being with Jarvis while they were away from each other."
3,It wasn't too bad!,"The book was pretty interesting, however, there was too much repetition going on with Venice, Jarvis, and Craig."
5,A serious page turner for me.,"I enjoyed this book. I can't complain about anything. The writing was perfect. I understood this is the enviornment of a college student, so I read the book as such. Didn't over analyze any of the characters...just went w/ the flow. Overall I loved the book, It grabed so many emotions from me...I was happy one minute and sad and fussing and yelling the next. The point is, it had me reading and wanting more. I look forward to the next book ""Been there done that"". I will be supporting this author. 5 Stars."
4,A good read!,This was a good book. It had quite of bit of exchanging between three people that will keep you interested. This book will have you wondering what's going to happen next - all the way to the end. Who will Venice choose? You will have to read it to find out!
1,Yuck!,This book ain't nothing but a bad soap opera! It was so long & drawn out that it took me a whole month to finish it. It was so predictable you knew what was going to happen next (which wasn't much). I guess I was expecting something good to come out of this book.
4,Great first novel,"I really liked the book, I believe that the target audience is young adults. The plot is very simple but it one of the best books Ive read in a long time; it's a far cry from that ghetto fabulous, hood rich girl with the hustlin boyfriend. It was a bit long but if you are really interested in the book it shouldn't take you over 4 days to read."
4,Sequel Please,"I read ""All that and a bag of chips, and I also read the excerpt from ""Been There Done That'. I'm not sure if this is the continuation of Bag of chps..but, that 2 page excerpt had Jarvis dying in bed.It also talked about Craig and how successful he was...Is there really a second book to this storyline called ""Been There Done That?"", or was that a tease. Please give us the sequel."
2,Too Drawn Out,"I have to agree with some of the others. This book was too drawn out. And I am sorry, but this does not happen in college. And to be truthful, I do not know any man, especially a black man, that will allow you to sleep with another man and continue to be in love with you. And there were some typing errors as well. I would recommend this book to college students, but I would advise you not to try what Vernice did. Maybe the sequel will be better since they are now adults. Maybe."
2,All hype and nothing more,"Immature writer. Immature story. Immature characters. I felt like screaming at Venice, ""Pick one already!"" What woman do you know in her right, educated mind would be sleeping with two men and declaring love for both of them at the same time? A woman in love won't, but a woman in lust will. Not worth buying. Borrow it from a friend if you're really have nothing else to read."
5,fantastic shampoo,"Excellent product, a little pricey. The shampoo is pretty thin and comes out fast, so you use more than you might want to. However, the results are always amazing, which is why I keep buying it."
4,"Well, bless my soul!","This is a tribute album to songwriter Otis Blackwell. Blackwell wrote hit songs for Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and others. Most of the renditions of his songs here are pretty good. None of them come close to matching the versions by the original artists, but none of them suck, either. Anyway, it's good to see this sometimes overlooked songwriter getting some recognition."
4,recommend the audio book - very upbeat and amusing,"I'm not a Simpsons fan - not against it, just not that interested - but still enjoyed listening to most of this audio book, which I downloaded from my library. She comes across as a sweet happy-natured upbeat person who is interested in making people laugh.So listening to the audio book was like hanging out with a funny, cheerful, and very entertaining friend who tells great stories. All the funny voices and sounds she demonstrates in narrating the book make it fun to listen to as light audio book entertainment."
2,Moon Handbook - Baja,"I purchased this book at the suggestion of a bi-annual guest at our beach front home in Baja. The information contained therein is out dated. Nor does it provide any ""insider tips"" or information that cannot be found by the most average of tourist. As a reference book - fair. As an ""insider's guide"", earns a below average grade. Suggest a buyer check a local library or browse a local bookstore prior to making an investment of $20. Wish I had!"
5,Baja Guide,"My interest was in Nature of the Baja Penninsula and the Pacific Coast. The Baja Handbook gives an excellent summary of what is there but also, especially in the case of the Whales, something of their life cycle. It was a very usefull Guide for my purposes"
4,Pretty helpful,"I bought this book prior to our one-week vacation outside of Ensenada. The information was very good and up-to-date (which is hard to accomplish sometimes in ever changing Mexico). I used it mostly for suggestions on site-seeing, restaurants, accommodations, and wineries.The map for Ensenada and the surrounding area was pretty good (better than anything else I could find), but the map for Tijuana wasn't that helpful. We were re-routed to the Otay Mesa border crossing but were not able to locate it because it was not listed on the map. We ended up having to figure out another route to the San Ysidro border crossing.I live in San Diego, so I will likely continue to use this book as reference for when I venture to the other side of the border."
5,Better than Lonely Planet Book,"I purchased the lonely planet book first, then misplaced it. Then I found this book and i have to say it is much better. The history, natural history and other tidbits included made me that much more excited about traveling in Baja. Not to mention it is more thoroughly written, better descriptions of destinations and how to get there. I feel this book will better prepare me for the trip. As others have already mentioned it's not just a great book on Baja, its a superbly written travel book in general."
5,A must have for any trip to Baja,"This book is just great. It starts out with a good basic overview of the area. I used the book on a recent trip to La Paz. The maps are excellent and very easy to use. The prices are a bit off at times but still in the range. The hotels are broken down into price categories, that was very helpful. The book helped with getting around by bus and the restaurant sections gives good accurate descriptions. This book was just super. If your going to Baja, anywhere in Baja, get this book it is well worth the price."
3,FIVE STARS FOR THE DIVERTIMENTO,I bought this for the Divertimento which is great as conducted by Dorati. I don't care for early Bartok so I didn't listen to the Mandarin. The Sonata is not a very good piece of music. But it's worth buying this for the Divertimento.
4,Cross-Centered,"This short cross-centered book (you can read it in one sitting)is a helpful reminder of the glory of God's rescue of sinners from his own righteous wrath through the gift of his precious Son. Mahaney reminds us that it was our own personal sin that nailed Jesus to the cross and our own face in the crowd that cried ""crucify him! crucify him!"" And he points us to the joy and assurance that comes from trusting the love and grace unleashed through Jesus's substitutionary work. One piece of advice: combine your order of this book with ""Songs for the Cross-centered Life,"" a CD produced by the ministry which C. J. Mahaney leads. Your heart will soar with the songs which express the truth of this book."
1,"Boring DVD, not worth your time.",This video is boring and uninviting. Nothing more to say. I would not recommend this for education or for entertainment value.
1,Very bad quality DVD,"I recieved this item on time, no doubt. But it only worked for 15 minutes. It was a very cheap qualilty disk. Tried both on DVD and laptop to make sure it was the DVD that was at fault. Sellers should definately consider supplying better quality disks."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"While QSQT might have played well in Indian movie houses, this American home viewer was sadly disappointed. I like Aamir Khan and wanted to see his early entry into Hindi cinema. However, I had to continually suspend my disbelief to begin to enjoy any of this movie. The two paternal ""heavies"", for instance, were so one-dimensional that they seemed cartoonish. The so-called ""fight"" scenes were laughable and reminded me of the old televison series, Batman; I expected to see the words BAM! POW! SOCK! The editing was sloppy, the musical numbers were uninspired and there were numerous logical gaps in the storyline. Finally, the English subtitles were terrible. Watch Lagaan or Fanaa to see Aamir Khan in far better films."
4,Good Referance Source,"My Creative Writing teacher suggested I pick up this book, and it really helped me. It is much simpler, when writing a story, to use symbols rather than description. However, I had no idea what symbols to use for God, love, and other broad subject. That's where this book came in. Look up any subject and it has the symbol for it. A must have for English majors."
1,Not very good,"If you're buying this for a little kid they may like it. Unfortunately, for anyone else, this game is a waste of your money."
3,Decent game but not as good as first.,"My two biggest complaints about this game are that its too short and too easy. The first incredibles game was much longer and much more difficult, even to the point of being frustrating. This game is incredibly short (got it for my 6 year old sister for Christmas and we finished it last night) and very simple. If you can pound buttons you can win this game. This is a better game to rent than to buy."
4,I Feel Like I Really Met Josefina,"Josefina, a Spanish girl, lives in New Mexico with her father and three older sisters. Her story takes place in 1824 New Mexico, on her father's ranch. New Mexico was still a part of Mexico, then. When her mother dies, Josefina and her sisters must struggle to cope until a surprise arrives with her Abuelito's caravan from Mexico City, which gives her hope and a wonderful idea.The story has a happy ending, and I couldn't wait to read the rest of the books in this series! I recommend this book to any girl who likes excitement and adventure."
4,Meet Josefina,"I liked this book because it showed a little bit of a different culture. It showed that even though it was set in 1824 in New Mexico, that the things that are important are the same to people everywhere. Also it was an exciting book. I would recommend it."
5,Outstanding,This guy's been painting and winning awards for 50 years! Wade is obviously a master. The instruction is on target. He is one of Australian's best loved watercolorists. Get the book. It's great.
2,"Elementary, Watson","This book is very basic. The artist uses his own vanity gallery to illustrate extremely rudimentary principles of art. If you're a rank beginner, you may get something out of this, otherwise, skip it. He even admits ""I have never attended art school or art classes!"""
5,OUTSTANDING!!,"I first heard Richard Shindell while listening to an NPR station in Minnesota (I think) many years ago. I was listening via the web. I was immediately drawn to his music. And his VOICE... simply amazing! I spent quite a while tracking down that station's playlist to find out who he was. I finally did... then immediately went to Amazon to order Sparrow's Point. After falling in love with the CD, I ordered three more CD's of his and have been a diehard fan ever since. I guess ""folk"" music is his genre, but somehow his music transends that label. I find his voice hauntingly beautiful. This is not Peter, Paul, and Mary here folks (not that there's anything wrong with them!) I highly recommend Richard Shindell."
5,Musical Genius at Work :),"""The Courier"" Listen Listen Listen This is a little better live, but a powerful song nonetheless. ""Sparrows Point"" is a melancholy song that Richard rarely plays in concert. I guess the masses want more upbeat songs. It's a gem though. ""Memory Of You"" and ""You Again"" Listen Listen Listen is a masterpiece about the haunting of a lost love. ""Nora"" is along the same lines. ""Howling At The Trouble"" and ""By Now"" tell amazing stories and will attract our souls and emotions."
5,A CD you'll never regret having bought!,"If you've come upon ""Sparrow's Point"" ""accidently"" in the intentions of finding a very talented folk singer with a good accoutstic guitar and great lyrics, then you're very lucky to have found Richard Shindell. Being able to listen (on-line) to all the tracks of this cd is really good too, I mean, if you've listened to all these ""bits of tracks"" above and you've liked them, well then I suggest you buy this CD because what you've liked so far is only a third of what you will once you can listen to every (incredible and melodic) whole song on ""Sparrow's Point"" Enjoy! =)"
5,"A classic example of ""Salsa Dura"" from 1974.","This CD is indispensable. By itself, Marvin Santiago's unapolgetically funky remake of Tito Rodriguez' classic hit ""Hay Craneo"" is the CD's crown jewel but the Frankie Hernandez-led testesterone-charged descargas ""Cuando Te Vea"", ""La Vibora"" and ""Mi Ritmo Es Bueno"" offer additional incentive to buy it. This is Bobby Valentin's all-time funkiest CDand one that demands your pumping it up real LOUD on your stereo system to appreciate the glory of 1970s ""Salsa Dura""!!!"
1,air cleaner filter,"The filter didn't match the old filter for the 50-868 air cleaner that I have. Even Delta tools don't have the same filter that I have been using for the past year. The quality of the filter is not as good. The old filters, filtered smaller particles than the new."
1,What does exact product with no Delta label mean?,I own a 58-860 and believe this will fit but what does exact product with no Delta label mean? First off the label on the original is Purolator. Second if this is supposed to be exactly the Purolator part why isn't that label mentioned? I'd be leary of a part that is unlabeled keeping 1 micron dust from my lungs.
4,Wolfe rocks!,Top notch blues rock guitar playing with solid vocals and songwriting. Todd also does a nice job with his covers. this is a very good cd
5,Good quality and soft,"I bought these pillowcases to go with an entire set of sheets of the same brand. They are like the other reviewers described: thick, soft and good quality. Unfortunately Amazon does not seem to have them anymore. I've seen the same ones elsewhere, but for about $150 for a queen set!"
5,Great Quality Flannel,I bought these for some overstuffed pillows; I have other flannel sheet sets and these are the highest quality.
4,Wacky music for good times,"I first heard this album almost 20 years ago and only recently rediscovered it. R Crumb and Co. are great musicians who have carved out a unique niche in American music - string band old-timey cartoon-style music. What a lot of fun this group must have had puttin' this together! R Crumb - I know you're in France now, but we still need your music!"
1,Need better Editorial Description - Jesus doesn't live here.,"I feel the editorial description of this book is misleading. Had I not looked at the back cover itself, and browsed the pages, I would not have noticed the heavy handed religious nature of this book. There is certainly a market for such items, but they should be clearly described as such by the seller - which this one is not. Jesus does not reside in my kitchen, or anywhere else in my home for that matter, therefore this cookbook will not find it's way onto my shelf. I'm glad I didn't make the mistake of ordering it from the Editorial Description alone, I would have been returning it unread."
5,Assorted lolli molds,Made great chocolate lolli's. Candy came out of molds easy and washed up very nicely.
2,FOR DANCERS IN LOVE,"This album is not recommended unless you have a guy or girl who loves you so much and would love to dance,especially slowdance. It's like a high school senior attending the prom. Just imagine the HS senior elegantly dressed as is his/her date. They're holding each other,gently swaying to music like the music on this album. It's so beautiful. But it should not be just listened to. I wouldn't want to play this CD without my girlfriend/wife dancing with me."
2,More hiss than an angry cat,"The content on this disc is hard to beat. It has a good number of solid, desirable tracks - many of which are difficult to find on other compilations. This is the only reason I gave it two stars. But there's one BIG problem...I have NEVER heard sound this bad off a pre-recorded CD before. Even in the first track, you don't have to listen very deeply to hear scratches and pops. And some of the titles have so much hiss in the background, you'd swear you were listening to a half-worn cassette tape. When I first put this disc in, I started checking the speakers because I thought something was awry with my system. Nope - just dreadful sound from the disc. It literally sounds like someone dubbed the songs from LP to cassette and then over again to compact disc.This one isn't digitally remastered, it's belt-sanded."
3,Good only if you don't care about plot,"This film features fine actresses and beautiful settings. However, I think I have some understanding of linear plots, and this one quite simply didn't hold together, didn't hold water, and became an utter mish mosh towards the end. Flimsy writing mars an interesting setup."
4,Very funny with a delicious twist,"If Alfred Hitchcock had directed a murder mystery for Quakers, this might be the one. It is a very gentle take on Irish blarney with a lovely twist at the end. The major characters make it a joy to watch, especially Mia Farrow in a very subtle role."
4,LIGHTHEARTED FUN,"Natasha Richardson fans will find this a ""must"" for their DVD collections, but truly, ALL of the actors were perfectly cast in this lighthearted mystery/comedy set in 1926 Ireland. Joan Plowright, Mia Farrow and Jim Broadbent are all wonderful and the Irish landscapes are a joy to behold. Highly recommend !!!"
5,Widow's Peak,This classic is an exciting mystery to the very end. The casting is excellent! Charming movie.
2,Unsatisfactory,This remarkably convoluted and utterly impossible plot wastes the good talents of some fine actresses. It needed two rewrites.
3,Chocolate covered straw,"There are good things to enjoy, but ""Widows' Peak"" lacks a firm moral framework. I suspect that is why it sloshes around instead of directing effective satire on target."
5,Excellent brain teaser,"Mia Farrow is not my favorite actress, but I love her in this. She's awesome, covers her tracks, and the end just rocked me. I've watched this movie a half dozen times before I finally bought it. It's great for a ""girl's night"", but men like it, too. Suspenseful in that innocent British way, and incredible acting. Not too many movies surprise me with their ending."
4,Intelligent wity comedy. Great dialogue.,I really enjoyed this movie. I was laughing out loud when I least expected it. You need to watch this movie from beginning to end without interruption since the plot builds from the very beginning to a wonderful surprise ending. Joan Plowright was just wonderful. This is a movie that you can watch over and over.
5,entertaining & smart,"I am purchasing this video because I enjoyed Mia Farrow in a different role, other than a Woody Allen movie. Natashia Richardson is really good too. This is a movie that you'll pick up by chance and it will entertain you. It reminded me of Waking Ned Devine. I recommend it to everyone."
3,Humdrum and Trivial,There are LOTS of alternatives out there on virtuoso guitar. Check the Segovia Collection. Check Barrueco Nylon and Steel. The only advantage this one has is price.
5,Skills and Principles of the sport. Biographies and pictures,"A must-have for any beginning wrestler. step by step guidelines to important principles of amateur wrestling. Basic skills and principles to the sport are taught. Lists many helpful body exercises to improve wrestling skills. Also contains brief biographies of pioneers in the sport here in America, such as Gotch, Hackenschmidt, and Gable. Has pictures of different variations of wrestling, such as NCAA tournaments and Indian wrestling to belt wrsetling and Greco-Roman meets."
4,Credits?,"The Amazon.com product listing states that Fistoulari conducts Adam's Giselle and that Dorati conducts the other titles. Yet most of the reviews congratulate Dorati for the Giselle.Well, which is it? If these auditors are unable to read a jewel case insert, it bodes ill for their reviews. Who conducts what?"
2,Lacking but works,I did not know at the time of purchase that this fixture did not come with a mounting bracket. Other than this problem there is nothing wrong with the light and it works well. I simply had to drill a hole in the housing and screw it to the wall. Granted I cant aim the light like I could if it had a bracket but it does what I needed it to do.
4,Bigger then I thought :),"I just received the taggies pink giraffe in the mail today. My daughter, who is 3, liked it right away. Probably since it was pink. It is intended for my 9 mth son. He hasn't had too much of a chance to play with it, but he has enjoyed it from the little I've seen. It is a bit bigger then I thought it was going to be. It comes to my son's nose when he is sitting up and they are both on the ground. This is not a toy that can easily fit into a diaper bag or large purse and go. The bigger size does mean that the tags are easier to grab onto since they are larger.I think I will be letting my daughter have the giraffe if she wants it and I'll order the lion or zebra for my son and see if they are a bit smaller.Overall, I think it is very cute and I think my son will enjoy it. The size was just a surprise."
2,Not as soft as I expected...,"I was disappointed by the quality of this lion. It was not as soft as I expected it to be, and seemed dingy. I ended up returning it."
3,Cute and Cuddly,"Cute and soft. Tags are a good idea and are multi-textured. Tags are large enough for little explorers to stick their fingers through the loops. Although my 8 month old spends time carefully picking at tags on other toys the ones incorporated on the Taggie Soft Lion do not seem to interest her, to much of a good thing I guess."
4,Pam,This product took FOREVER to ship to me. I had to contact the seller to find out why they billed me and hadn't sent yet. Communication needs improving.
2,Color different in real life,"On the internet, the backpack looks white with brown stripes. When I received the product in the mail, it had pink and blue stripes along with the brown ones. I'm returning it to get a different one!"
3,Calculus I with Precalculus,"The book I received was in excellent condition - like brand new!!! I needed this book ASAP and was disappointed that there was not an option to select expedited shipping. I order from Amazon all the time and have had items shipped this way before so I am not sure what the problem was. Anyway, even though I received it later than expected, the book is in excellent condition. If I need a book ASAP again, I am not sure if I would order from this seller because of the expedited shipping problem."
1,Horrible,"Poor examples, questions from test book don't resemble questions in the book. I hope you don't get stuck with this one. Professor even stated it was a poor book."
5,Black's older editions are more complete.,"This law dictionary is the standard of the industry. 4th editions are very complete but not off the chart in price like earlier ones. Ideal for constitutional and UCC issues. Newer editions keep getting smaller and have less information. This is the best, most complete and most economical of the choices available."
3,Looks nice on the shelf,"Black's is the authority in law, BUT this volume is too heavy to carry around. This is heavilly recommended in orientation and students rush to buy it, then it becomes a doorstop.[...]Once you get to a Writing and Legal Research course, your school will usually provide a WestLaw password (good for the rest of your semesters).Black's is available on line in WestLaw.So, everybody buys Black's, but very few continue to carry it around to classes, and like most other sources it is readilly available on line.This will look nice on the shelf behind your desk when you start to practice."
1,received older product,I was not able to use it as the adhesive had melted onto the plastic backing so I assume I was sent very old product.
2,Disappointed with Distressed!,"This item was purchased for my girlfriend, a Ms Beverly Kelly for a project she was doing at her school (she is an educator). I was upset to see that you could barely see the images on the shirt. When I purchased it, there was NO mention of it being faded on purpose.I was, and am, very disappointed.RegretfullyLuis G Hernandez Jr"
5,Outstanding,"Captain John Nance a former Braniff International Airways pilot has done an outstanding job of relating the incidents that caused one of the greatest airlines to fail. He sticks to the facts and only the facts. As a reader you can almost picture yourself there as these events unfolded. In addition to this book, Captain Nance as also wrote several others. I've read everything he has wrote and I have to say that each book is as good as the last one."
5,MUST READ,"For any old airliner this is a fascinating tale of Braniff International Airways, an iconic carrier during the 60s and 70s. Those were the good old days when flying was an adventure and not a cattle run like today."
4,Harken back to those thrilling days of yesteryear...,"I would have given this 5 stars on the merit of the music, but I grew up in Denver listening to the Astronauts (at least until 1965 or so) and attempting to sound like them in my bands, so I figure I'm probably biased and tried to compensate. I first learned to get the breaking surf sound from the beginning of Wipe Out by watching Rich Fifield kick his reverb. They were (and are) amazing in that they were dead on with the surf sound, while also being able to kick it with the sound of black R&B and early rock 'n' roll. It's ironic that this latter sound would be such a heavy influence on the Brits who were storming the shores at the same time and whose invasion would ultimately spell the end for the Astronauts."
5,Surfing with the Astronaunts/Everything is AOK,How great to hear the music of my youth. The sounds are great & what wonderful memories. The fact that it won't wear out like the albums did is even better.
4,We have liftoff!,"Well, the countdown to buying this CD took a few years as I bought all the pre Pet Sounds Beach Boys CDs, Jan & Dean stuff, Pet Sounds, Dick Dale, Space Cossacks, some other surf stuff, and finally wore all that stuff out and in a continuing search for new surf rock ordered a CD by The Austronauts.Well, it isn't as polished as the Beach Boys, and The Austronauts seem more like a cover band than anything else, but I must say that the sheer authenticity of this band makes it great fun to listen to. I thoroughly enjoyed this CD and look forward to another orbit with The Austronauts."
1,STILL haven't recieved item!!!!!!,"I ordered the charger on the April 12th, and was suppose to receive by the 19th. Today is the 23rd and I still don't have it!! When I checked the status it has JUST been shipped today from the company. This to me is ridiculous."
1,DISAPPOINTING,wANTED TO LIKE THIS BUT JUST COULDN'T. sTORY LINE IS SO VAPID. sINATRA SEEMS GOOFY IN THIS EVEN WHEN HE SINGS.
1,stopped working again,"This is my second Tissot of the same model. After using it for 10 months, water leaked into it (I didn't bath/swim or dive with it). It then stopped working all together. I'll never buy this model again."
1,Eh... You really want to know?,"I really wanted to like this book. I really did. The illustrations were excellent, and the book was well written. However, it was also a little disappointing. I really had been hoping to get some more information on the lost tribe on the Bunyip and some relatively new antagonists for my players. However, the only new tribe was the Iron Riders, a more archaic name for the Glass Walkers. And while there were some fairly original fomori, they weren't terribly interesting. Some of the totems and gifts were all right, but overall I think White-Wolf could have done so much more with this book."
2,Major disappointment,"I own a boat, spent time in the Navy, and love being on the water. So I expected some excitement in these stories. But there is none. Rather, they are essays on the maritime industry, all of which had been previously published in a maritime newsletter for professionals. The essays include discussions on various ship laws, hiring practices, professional education, medical practices at sea, women working on ships, and the like. A number of pictures are included, but all are so small as to be almost worthless. I kept reading to the end, but never came across anything interesting. It was a major disappointment!"
4,Runs a little small,"Bought this for my husband in a medium (probably should have gotten x-large, he's 5'11"" 185.) It barely fits me (I'm 5'11""). Don't read into the pre-shrunk. Good quality compared to other silk screened shirts I have gotten him. Nice thick material and quality silk screening."
2,"An incredable selection of music for the era, but mostly sound bytes.","I am impressed my the large selection of music on the disk, but I am very disappointed by the shortness of every piece. Most of these are around 90-120 seconds each, at the longest. Several are only 30 seconds long. You are still deciding if you like the tunes when they end. If you are looking for a catalog of the music from the Revolutionary War, this is a great overview of tunes. But you will not be satisfied with the performances, owing to there brevity. Not the musicians fault, they perform wonderfully."
4,an entertaining little story with likeable characters,"While I don't think this movie will blow anyone away, I do think it's a good story (based on a long short story or novella, by Etgar Keret - whose short stories I highly, highly recommend)and an interesting take on suicide. By focusing on the humorously monotonous afterlives of a couple characters (all of whom are very likeable) and then adding an eccentric Tom Waits (another genuius whose body of work I highly recommend)we get a unique take on suicide, friendship, love, life and afterlife. If you're the increasingly rare type who can enjoy a movie without supermodels and explosions, then I think you'll probably enjoy Wristcutters - A love story.Oh, and as an added bonus, the music of gogol bordello makes up a large part of the soundtrack (this movie actually served as my introduction to both Keret and Gogol - and by proxy Eugene Hutz... yet another genius)"
5,Refreshing!,"I loved this movie.Whenever I mention the title to anyone, they kind of make a face. And I follow it up with, ""No no, it's a really good film. It's a love story. With a lot of dark humor."" No body really gets it until they watch it though.I'm not going to spoil it for anyone but it's a very touching story. I haven't read the story it was based on, but I'll have to now."
5,Fresh Air on Your DVD,"Sure, you see the end coming from way off and it has big-time echoes of Defending Your Life and even more so of the great Japanese film After Life, but Wristcutters for most of its under 90 minutes has it all -- wit, acting, an ugly and barren netherlife for suicides, and in it all something original and sobering to say about life and the deliberate loss of it. Can you really resist a movie whose protagonist says, ""Soon after I killed myself I got a job at Kamikaze Pizza,"" or that the place he winds up is pretty much like living except just a little worse. It is a world of no smiles (and the cast stays true to that) and no stars, but apparently endless supplies of gas stations in bleak vistas. And if all that's not enough it's got Tom Waits, Gob from Arrested Development as the Messiah, and a long almost forgotten Del Shannon song, Cry Myself to Sleep, on the soundtrack.Not to be missed."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I could not believe how horrible the movie was. The trailor looked great, I thought ""What a clever idea for a movie!"". I was so utterly disappointed. The only reason I finished it, was in the hopes that the end would have some interesting twist. We had to fight not to fall asleep the entire way through. It had a twist, but it was not interesting or thought-provoking in any way. I wish I could have the hours of my life back!"
5,Wristcutters,"Great movie. Plenty of well known actors. A boys trip through purgatory, to find a love lost, a new love, and a reason for living."
1,Terrible movie,I thought that the movie was going to be more entertaining. The girl isn't pretty enough and I was expecting a more dramatic movie. Not worth the money.
2,Not for grown folks,"...and fairly bad, at that. This is an inept indie comedy. You can feel the book drowning in the undercurrent of the film-there are cute ideas begging to be exploited everywhere, but the screenplay's imagination is stunted. I love Tom Waits and Gogol Bordello, but everyone is literally and figuratively dead here."
5,quirky and bizarre in the best way!,"This little gem of a film is a must for anyone who enjoys those bizarre twisty movies, think Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind, Being John Malkovich, or Stranger than Fiction...that type of thing. It's really interesting and weird, and the awesome Gogol Bordello soundtrack and cameos by Nick Offerman and Will Arnett really are the cherry on top. Highly recommend it for anyone who likes to take a journey into the mind/subconcious/alternate reality type of film."
4,Quirky,"A delightful movie. Whimsical. Hopeful. It takes its time, so if you like a lot action, skip it. And you need to like offbeat films. Killer soundtrack from Gogol Bordello."
5,kitchen garden,This book is lovely and inspirational and full of good ideas. I do not have time for such an elaborate garden but I have planted mine using many of their ideas an it is beautiful and functional.
4,A Worthwhile Read!,Excellent illustrations (pictures and charts) to help define a kitchen garden. Could be more practical for small home gardens.
2,Not what I wanted,"I really wanted a useful book that would help to develop a kitchen garden, but this book is really just a beautiful coffee table book with pictures of lovely gardens.If you want a book that tells you how to go about GROWING things, skip this one."
3,"No LED's, dented case, dead after 8 months","As everyone else mentioned, this product doesn't actually have the LED's as shown. I figured that before I ordered, so no big deal.It also arrived with the power supply casing dented at the top and bottom on one side, as though it was dropped on its side The box it was shipped in was pristine which leads me to believe it was dented when it was packed (or before), not damaged during transit.But it works, it's quiet, and I need my PC now, so as a lazy passive-aggressive consumer I'm just going to keep it and gripe a little about the dents.*Updated 4/6/2009 - can't reboot my PC anymore, the power supply is making lots of noise and just isn't delivering enough juice to run the PC anymore.It gets to the stage where it scans for drives and freezes - which is the same problem I had when I replaced the original supply with this one...going to try a different brand, and one with more watts."
2,Who knows?,Received this product and it literally had screws falling out of the case. I'm not going to mess around with a power supply that is falling apart when brand new.
3,Another quality Coolmax product,"A very nice power supply that works well (so far).Installation was a breeze, however, instructions should be included for those who may be less computer savvy (or more cautious than myself).The unit delivered did not have the LEDs as advertised - thus the reduction to three stars."
4,worthwhile,"This book was used in our church's book club and was well-received. It would be especially worthwhile as a tool to convince people of the importance of church membership. If you are already a member of a church, it calls you to greater commitment. The second part of the book has to do with preparing for Sunday worship and is convicting and challenging (very good). The author does have a weak position on the Christian sabbath (won't say the 4th commandment applies to today) and yet he, in my humble opinion, contradicts himself by emphasizing the importance of Sunday worship. So in the end you are left with some good material on Sabbath observance."
2,OK,"I like the illustrations Josh gives with the Church being the Bride of Christ, but this book was totally written from a pastor's perspective. Josh believes you should be at the church whenever the doors are open, and if you are not there, you are living in sin. Come on, it's easy to be at every single church function when that's your job and you have Mondays off!One big contradiction is that Josh later talks about how important it is that we reach out to people. So, when we're doing church activities when our time is free, when do we reach out? I think this book is similar to I Kissed Dating Goodbye. It's filled with lots of personal opinions with shallow scriptural references. There are some good ideas, but keep in mind they are all opinions."
5,Excellent Book! Highly Recommend!,"This is a classic by Joshua Harris. If you are familiar with his books then you will appreciate what he has to say about the church. Many struggle today with the purpose of the church because there are so many false teachers who are only after your money. It's no wonder that many have nothing to do with the church. In Stop Dating the Church, Joshua Harris challenges you to change your thinking about the church and see its importance. Because this book has presented such a challenge to our leadership, we use it for prospective new members. A must read for current members or prospective and by those who have flat given up on the local church!"
4,ready for the next step..,"- If you have ever been in a relationship you know the intensity of the begging. There is the attraction, the lust, and then the transition into a relationship the initial attraction cools off. In Stop Dating the Church: Fall in Love with the Family of God by Joshua Harris, the author speaks from his own experience of tip toeing around the formal church.Harris takes you through the steps needed to be committed to have a full relationship with a church. To be selfless, involved, and committed to God's word. A spiritual journey is an intimate relationship and one that takes certain persistence.Harris has written several dating books and this one takes on a different dimension. Just find the right fit and be a part of this extraordinary opportunity to seek the plan God has for you."
2,"disappointing sound, disappointing package","Believe it or not, I'm actually a Peter & Gordon fan, and I actually thought that they released quite a bit of well performed, well recorded music. Collectables is nice enough to package 2 original albums on 1 CD; it's too bad they didn't bother to do a decent remaster or give any consideration to the packaging. The sound is all midrange and you can barely discern what the original 12"" covers looked like. Go find the original vinyl. It will cost you more, but you will be much happier."
2,"IT IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE,BUT NOT THE VIDEO ON SALE","I was waiting for 2 years for the DVD of Fanny and Alexander,but seems it will never ""be released"".The video is very poor quality,and auch! - the movie is cut so much it is hard to follow the story,some hours of it are missing.Is there a way to find the compleate genius work of Ingmar Bergman ?"
2,Bergman's least interesting work...,"I appreciate Ingmar Bergman as a great cinematic artist.Wild Strawberries, The Silence and Persona are three films I really enjoy. But I was just flat-out disappointed by Fanny and Alexander after reading so many glowing reviews about it. Perhaps it's the subject matter that doesn't appeal to me. I've never been a big fan of movies that delve into the insipid world of the bourgeois elite. I certainly don't mind slow-paced films that explore the subtleties of life, sans fiery explosions and gratuitous car chases, but that doesn't mean slow-paced films can't be boring and tedious.I would take exception with anyone who says they don't have at least one Bergman film that doesn't do it for them, and Fanny/Alexander is that film for me. That doesn't make it a bad movie; to each his own."
3,Alexander's nanny's fanny is a many splendored thing,"Hortense Briulle, notoriously scandalous French cinema verite star, simultaneously beguiles and repels the viewer with her stream-of-consciousness ad-libbing in several romance languages while often puncutating her commentary with gutteral howls, shrieks, grunts, moans, jabs and lurches toward the camera. Critics have called it ""...reminiscent of early John Waters,"" who, interestingly, has a cameo role here as Professor Geronimo Huit, the elderly music teacher. A must see, but not on a full stomach."
5,Quite Superior to Original Theatrical Version,"The longer TV series included in this set is far superior to the theatrical version. One of the five disks is a new HD transfer of the original theatrical edition so you get it all. If it is available, buy this set. Used sets are a particular value. You won't be sorry.I consider this, Bergman's last major film, to be his finest and perhaps one of the best films ever made. Because it is Bergman's writing and directing, the theatrical values are excellent. It has an all star Swedish cast who turn in outstanding performances. I don't usually comment on subtitles. Whoever wrote these has a wonderful grasp of the subtleties of the English language.All in all, one hell of a movie."
1,Criterion review,"I *LOVE* this film.I just *HATE* Criterion refuses to include spanish subtitles in their products. Why deny spanish-speaking people the option of viewing the best films of history in the best format available?Hey, Criterion people... could you change your mind?"
3,Fanny and Alexander - Too Long.,"Fanny and Alexander should be rated ""TL"" for too long!It seemed to just drag along, with more emphasis placed on costumes than a decent story line.The plots involving supernatural stuff could also have been done without."
1,So not what I expected!,"I was so excited to get my new purchase based on rave reviews and its beautiful packaging, which I feel is the only reason it deserves a star at all. I applaud the graphic designers for this truely beautiful box set and its photography. Though, I must say the story itself is dark and brooding with affairs and sex, children watching a bare butted uncle blow out candles with his fart! I would deam this most inapprpriate viewing with company of any kind. I purchased this based on it's recomendation as a Christmas film. IT IS NOT A CHRISTMAS MOVIE! So as I noted if you are a fan, to each their own. But do not buy this film for it's Christmas overtones or family tale, for whatever lovliness it does contains is quickly gone with each additional frame of the movie."
4,Accessible Bergman,"The Bottom Line:A good place for Bergman neophytes to start (stay away from Persona!), Fanny and Alexander is an involving family drama that stays involving for its 3 hour+ running length even if it gets a bit off-track when mysticism enters the screenplay during the second act; the acting is good, the pace is steady, and the period detail is impeccable, which adds up to a memorable and worthwhile film.3.5/4"
3,"You love some, you only play some.","I like 80's music, and this cd had some songs that I hadn't heard in a long time. I recommend it if the downloads aren't available to you."
4,A Good Collection,"This is a very good collection of the music of the later 80's. These are all the artists you loved but forgot when the ""touch me baby touch me baby oh yeah oh yeah"" music came into power. My personal favorites are ""Don't Dream It's Over""-Crowded House, ""Need You Tonight""-INXS, and ""Luka""- Suzanne Vega. This is a very good disc, and it's what music needs!"
5,Fast Shipping!,I am so glad I was able to find this book at an affordable price :)Thank you for shipping my book right away!
2,Mayan Languages,"This translation of the Popol Vuh is not very good compared to the one by Dennis Tedlock that has been updated once again. This one does, however, have some interesting new photographs from the author's research among the Tzutuhil Maya around Lake Atitlan. Note that the Tzutuhil do they speak the language of the Popol Vuh (Quiche). The errors in translation relate to the differences in these two Mayan languages."
2,Disappointed with design,"We have lots of Folkmanis puppets. My favorite is the Pirate. He has a glove on the back so he's easy to manipulate. Princess, Prince, Queen and King are different however. You put your thumb in one sleeve, your pinky in the other sleeve and your index or middle finger in the head in order to make the puppet move. It is not very easy. It is almost impossible for my 7 year old to move the puppet because her hand is so small that the span between thumb and pinky doesn't reach the sleeves/hands of the puppet. I'm not sure why all the 5 star reviews. We have the Prince with the blue cape and crown (old model). I am not sure if they improved him and made him more like the Pirate (who has a glove on the back) or not. But I wouldn't buy them the way they are if I've seen them in the store. Buying online is sometimes hard."
4,"Love the product, but hate the beeping","This is my second Tanita scale/bodyfat monitor. The first one lasted over a decade and worked well for me, so I bought this one which is an upgraded version. It seems more accurate (less variation in body fat) and tracks about the same as my last one (my weight and body fat didn't vary from the old scale to the new one). My only complaint is that it beeps several times as it goes through its paces. This might be fine for some folks, but if you have a spouse who gets up at 4:30 in the morning, you really might not want it beeping. I couldn't find anywhere in the manual where you could turn the beeping off. To me, it makes this scale really annoying. Other than that, it works just fine."
1,disappointed,the results are unstable; wide variations in all read outs within only one hour of time.
1,another shame on you kimora,"this shir is so thin that after you eash it it will fall apart. I purchased it brcause of the rhinestones in the center, they arent even beads this is worth 9.99 if you are a large this will not fit,if you are a small get a medium"
1,Nice... If they sent the right size!,These were advertised for the Big Kid...but I was sent the Little kid. so I had to return them...STILL WAITING ON THE REFUND!!! They did look comfortable though.
2,"Hard to follow, Needs a lot of Prerequistes","This book had some interesting points, but assumed a lot of prior knowledge in the topics. He often quoted other authors I haven't read up on, doing his own book a disservice. I had to buy it for a class, and we spent most of the time trying to expand upon the fairly dense topics that weren't properly fleshed out in the book."
4,Compelling history,"Concluding Foote's narrative history of the American Civil War, the final volume opens with Grant and Sherman's plans for the defeat of the Confederacy and the failure of the Red River campaign. It includes the capture of Atlanta, Sherman's march to the sea, Sheridan's reduction of the Shenandoah Valley, and climaxes with Lee's surrender at Appomattox. It also includes the tragic anticlimaxes of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the capture and imprisonment of Jefferson Davis. As denoument it touches briefly on the Reconstruction and the post-war years of the veterans of the conflict, Jefferson Davis, and other notable figures in the nation's bloodiest conflict. As before, Foote's prose is objective yet compelling, bringing the personalities to vivid life."
5,"Shelby Foote,s three volume History of the Civil War","Shelby Foote spent his life researching and writing these books, and it shows. This is the most interesting mass of information compiled in a flowing fashion that I believe has been written. It has so much personally revealing biographical information about the persona of the Civil War that one cannot but gain insight as to the causes and results of the fighting. One that has interest in history or warfare cannot afford to miss this journey."
2,Does not live up to its reputation,"It's too bad that Foote writes so well (even if he's a bit wordy at times) because that has ensured that these bad books have become one of the most important sources of popular opinion on the Civil War. All three volumes are filled with errors; not just interpretive but serious factual errors as well. Read McPherson's ""Battle Cry of Freedom"" instead. Even Bruce Catton's older stuff has stood the test of time better and, in my humble opinion, is far more eloquent"
5,The very best!,"I have owned the 2 LP's this CD is comprised of for longer than I care to admit. What a thrill to find that they have been reproduced on CD. Special attention should be given to ""Gravy Waltz"" with words by the inimitable Steve Allen to say nothing about ""Every Day"". The side men on this album are superlative and never to be equalled. Actually, ""At Newport `63"" is my favorite album out of the two but I can't see how anyone can go wrong with anything by Joe Williams whom I have enjoyed ever since what I believe was his first album, ""A Man Ain't Supposed to Cry"". His passing was a tremendous loss and I am still overwhelmed when I hear him.All I can say is ""buy this album""."
3,"Half correct, but altogether unconvincing.","In the book The Lady and the Virgin, Penny Schine Gold presents a two-fold argument: first, that the relationship between the image of women and the reality of the existence of women is far more complex than traditionally imagined, representing a continual pattern of ambivalence and contradiction; and second, that measuring the culture, society, and images of the Middle Ages in terms of modern values and ideas, or even in terms of good and bad, is of far less benefit than an effort to ""understand medieval people within their own terms."" These patterns are analyzed in four areas: secular image, religious image, religious life, and secular life. In regards to secular image and reality, her points are quite clear and successfully made; however, her arguments on religious image and reality are both unconvincing and easily refuted....."
4,Mickey pencils,Shows picture in package but when arrived they were 12 loose pencils. They were gifts so did not like that I received something that did not look like picture.
3,Fun though not too deep,"Fun video. Doesn't go too far, but what can you expect on a video. Nice to see someone else's approach to playing."
5,Adventures in Sound,"Soma is a side project of Dave Thrussel, also of SNOG fame. His work on Soma, though, is incredible. This is the more ""dancy"" of the Soma albums, with songs like Soma Romanz, Sleepwalkers, and Dark Koma. Other high points are Corporate Anthem 1 and Nightsoil, while not as dancefloor friendly, are great pieces of music. If you like textured, complex albums, that sometimes make you want to move, this is for you."
5,Great Book.,"Fantastic book that is quite an endeavor to get through (very long). As I read, I imagined Shelby Foote's slow southern drawl narrating the passages. Everything you would want to know about the civil war."
2,A review of the AUDIO version of the classic series,"If I were reviewing the books, which I adore, I would be giving this work a far higher rating. I am, however, reviewing the audio version, and unfortunately Amazon hasn't bothered to seperate the book and audio versions of various written works, so this review will end up in with the reviews about the actual work. I like to read and listen to books at the same time when they are especially long and invovled, as Mr. Foote's books are. However, the narrator is anything but pleasant to listen to. Imagine the nasally twang of a early radio reporter's voice, the sort of voice which might have been talking about baseball scores, quick and harsh, and you've got it pretty close. This is not at all the right voice to hear about the trials and horrors of the Civil War. Why this voice was used I can't begin to imagine. It is just so disappointing. I hope with all my heart that someone rereads this at some point."
4,A long long long hard read....,"Well I can say that this is the most difficult Civil War book I have read. It has taken me a lot to read it all the way through. Mr. Foote's style of writing is very dry and dull. It will flow nice but then it gets long and well very boring to read. I have had this book for well over a year, I have picked it up read some got very bored with it put it down, then pick it up a again. I have been told that the whole 3 volume series is a must read, I must say that if you can sit down and conqur this, you were dedicated. I myself cannot. It is very detailed in almost every angle of the begining of the war. The book covers all theaters of the war, though it jumps around. Would I consider this a must read for a Civil War Buff as my self....well....I leave that up to the you! I have been looking at this 3 volume set for many many years, I think it will sit in my libaray for many many more years to come. Yes it has earned a spot in the CW classics."
2,Audio version of The Civil War,"While I loved the written book. The audio version is terrible. The voice I find to be quite irritating to listen to. I was not alone in this opinion as at first I thought it was just me, but then my darlin who was also listening to the recording,stated he found the voice to be grating. I wish they had found someone who had a voice not unlike Shelby Foote. He had a wonderful baritone drawl I could have listen to forever."
5,"A great undertaking, but worth it","I started reading ""The Civil War"" last Spring with a goal of completing the series. In January, I completed the third book. This book is a major time commitment.But, if the Civil War has always held an interest to you, and you're curious why things played out the way they did, why Lincoln is considered our greatest president, why this war showed the ways in which America could bundle its natural and human resources for modern warfare, including why the Civil War is the first great modern war, and if you want to lay some of the misconceptions you've had about it to rest - then you should read this book.I'm currently reading ""What God Hath Wrought"" and with the Civil War books, I think you get a good understanding of where America was at, now I'm trying to find out how it headed here."
5,Masterpiece!,"this work stands alone in its power and sweeping scope as the finest of civil war literature. told in narrative style, it is a must read!"
4,"Accurate, In Depth","First, I love Shelby Foote. I have seen him as a commentator in many documentaries. I would love to give him a Five star rating for this treatise, but I can't . I am absorbed with the civil war, but I got bogged down in the minutiae of this account. Sorry. For a historian, it would be a great read! I'm not a historian and I prefer the writing style of Jeff Shaara."
1,Unreliable seller,"I bought this scale and found that I didn't like it. Should be simple, right? But this seller DEMANDS that they issue you a ""return number"" before you can return an item. You have to call their 800-number, you get a recording, and then they NEVER CALL YOU BACK. Be wary. If you like the product, great. But you will not be able to return it."
1,Terrible Inventory Management,"I placed my order, received an order confirmation on the same day and then, SIX days later recieved an out of stock notification. Way to set the appropriate expectation!"
5,Sinatra DVD,I bought this dvd for my father for Fathers Day. He is 82. He loves it and has watched it several times. It takes him back to a special time in his life. I am happy they put this dvd togther. I think I will buy him another dvd in the series.
5,major reflection on war along history. Breathtaking.,"This book is the reflection work of someone with tremendous experience and scholar knwoledge; the kind of work that cannot be done if you don't have years of dedication behind you. The description and evaluation of technological changes and its effect in military conflict is magistral and magisterial. Is not an easy book to read, as a cheap novel; it is far more than that. The depth, clarity an intellectural richness of this major opus is simply enthralling. The capabilities of description of the problems and their evolution and of the solutions to them as a continuum along history are very impresive really. To me this is one of the most rich and challenging books I have gone through ever. Unfortunately, and perhaps, alas!, ominously this wonderful work of science and art is impossible to be bought in Britain."
4,Excellent tactics over the centuries remain validated.,Archer Jones describes 4 different formations that interlink in many different ways. These formations remain valid from the 1st century to the 21st! For people who study strategy and tactics this book is a MUST! It goes right next to Sun Tzu
4,Alarm Clocks - 'The Time Has Come' (Norton),"Good / very decent garage rock effort from this no-hit wonder four piece band. Despite these guys are practically unheard of, 'The Time Has Come' is a worthy pick - at least, I thought so. Tunes I was digging the most were ""Marie"", Bob Dylan's ""Like A Rolling Stone"", ""Feelin' Fine"", the catchy ""You're Everything To Me"", ""More Money"" and their foot-stomper - Bo Diddley's ""I'm A Man"" (rarely get tired of numerous bands covering this nugget). Personnel: Tom Fallon - guitar & vocals, Bruce Boehm - rhythm guitar, Mike Pierce - bass & vocals and Bill Schwark - drums & vocals. Will appeal to fans of Trashmen, Standells, Me & Them Guys and Syndicate Of Sound."
1,BORING AND UNORGANIZED,"This book is one of several required reading for the Stanard police supervisor promotion exam. If Stanard is using this to make up their test, it is little wonder people are rising to a level of their own incompetence. This book is boring, poorly organized, and generally full of complicated sentences that even a PHd would have trouble understanding. Although some ideas are good, the book does not flow well and therefore many concepts are lost in this wordy mess. Wake up Stanard, Municiple League, and administrators! A good supervisor should never be picked based on her/his ability to digest this type of ridiculous thrown together nonsense."
3,"Required reading, but bring no-doze!","This book is required reading for my department to take the Sgt's exam. If you have any problems going to sleep, read this and in 10 minutes you'll be out. There are a lot of good theories in this book, if you have any prior military service, you would have seen a lot of this before. It gives you a new insight on management, not leadership."
1,"pretention requires talent, too bad they are without","this album should have been an ep, for there are certain [few] songs that are tolerable. for the most part this album is a lame attempt at pretenious hipster sound rock that fails to make any of the former comparisons valid [aka spacemen3 or sonic youth]. i suggest that jon masters get a second job to pay for some singing lessons, and beg and pled aiden to stay with the band forever, because he truly is the talent hidden by the shadow of the so called lead singer. if it was up to me this would be aiden's album and his acoustic preformance would have been allowed to announce itself more prominently."
3,Swiss Army Watch,The watch does lose a minute of time a week I would have expected a little better from Swiss Engineering.However I am sure it will last for a few years being well backed up by Mr Watch and Victorinox.The watch is as good as it looked in the brochure.
2,not worth your time,My mother is a huge fan of the Williams Brothers and even she found this cd to be disappointing. I highly recommend the Greatest Hits Plus cd instead!
2,Mandisa,This only had two songs on it so I was very dissapointed as it did not indicate anywhere that you were getting a two song CD. But the songs were good as expected by Mandisa!
5,Large Print Keyboard,For anyone with low vision (I happen to have Macular Degeneration in both eyes) this keyboard is a God send.The enlarged white letters and numbers against a black back ground helps to see the keys much clearer.Most enlarged keyboards only work with PCs and since I own a Mac I am so glad it is compatible with my Mac OS X.I recommend this product highly.
3,Great until it falls apart,"I've owned three of this company's large-print keyboards, because they work great for about a year until the keys seem to catch on the mechanics underneath and they break down. I am throwing away the third and last one and buying up in quality, I hope. It's an inexpensive solution but not recommended by me for heavy use."
1,DO NOT BUY IF USING VISTA PLATFORM,"The Visikey Enlarged Print Keyboard would be ideal except for the fact that it is not compatible with the VISTAplatform. When I contacted Visikey (repeatedly) the onlyanswer was: ""We are working on a driver.""I will be returning it."
1,Didn't Last,Purchased this keyboard for my mother after reading other reviews. No issues with connecting it to her Mac. She enjoyed the easily visible keys. My only complaint with this keyboard is it died two weeks after the return date expired. I have tested it on three other machines and none will recognize that it is connected.
2,Poorly made product,"I was impressed at the look, design and feel of the product. I bought it for my uncle who suffers from macular degeneration, and it seemed like a good buy. I plugged in the USB and it loaded automatically and quickly with no problems. However, the spacebar did NOT work. So it is now sitting on my kitchen table, waiting to be returned. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Sticky Key Action = Big Hassle,"My dad used this with his Dell PC for about 18 months.Nice idea, but the key action is a bit sticky. They don't glide up and down as nicely as other keyboards. At first, it seems no big deal, but over time you notice typos, and it turns out to be a big hassle.Special purpose keys: quite handy, especially Sleep and Volume buttons, although the Wake button doesn't seem to work with his Dell PC.Wear: Under light use there has been no problem with wear. The markings are surface painted, not embedded in the keys, so I suppose there could be a wear issue if heavily used.The painted-on key markings are reasonably crisp and uniform, but not perfect.There are some competing keyboards on amazon, probably worth checking out."
1,What Julia said,"Just a short note to echo the previous 1 star poster.I had the same experience, but I gave up after 3 keyboards. The paint chipped badly on all of them, starting after a couple of weeks. Visikey seems to be out of business now. Their phone seems to be disconnected.The quality of this product is disgraceful. I wouldn't take another one if htye offered me one for free."
2,not bad for free!,"When we bought this keyboard it was to replace the pitiful toy that comes with an iMac. We wanted ONE keyboard; seller said they were billing for two! We called, obtained agreement they'd only send one. They sent two anyway, and I gave one away. Later we discovered they never billed our CC at all, but when I called to warn them the party who answered insisted they had already received payment. Duh.About the board: two issues: 1) some keys do NOT function correctly on the Imac, though for my work that's not critical; 2) the symbols E. A & S soon wore off the keys."
1,!!DO NOT GET THIS KEYBOARD!!,"The G key on arrival was broken, and the K key screen printing flaked off instantly on use. I might also add that this product is made with flimsy cheep plastic, and the keys feel clunky/sticky. This product is not worth the $38 - $40 I payed for it. I'm returning it for a refund at once."
2,Run very small!!!!!,This is a good pair of capris but they run very small for size Order larger than normal size!!!!@
3,Upside down,"In order to use this device in a standard cat5 jack, we have to use a patch cable and coupler. Otherwise, you won't be able to see the lights. The lights are on the same side as the clip and standard jacks have the clip on the bottom..."
3,"Works, but in need of serious update.","True this is a multi-speed network detector, but I neglected to check the speeds before purchase. If you are expecting to find 100M/Gigabit detection (as I was), you won't find it here; this device is only 10/100M detection. Who even makes 10M equipment anymore??? So it is safe to say that for average users, the multispeed feature is worthless. It will let you know if a active ethernet signal is available so that's why I gave it 3-stars."
2,"Merry Christmas, Ho! Ho! Ho! Reissued Again","~ This CD is simply Lou's classic Christmas recording of 1967 re-packaged and re-issued. Except this time they left off two tracks. Although the music here is great, the two star rating is because you can get more music with better sound by going to the great Lou Rawls Christmas CD ""Merry Christmas, Baby"" from 2006. That CD contains all 11 tracks from ""Merry Christmas, Ho! Ho! Ho!"" plus nine more tracks. See my complete review of the CDMerry Christmas Babyhere on Amazon."
5,gpr,"This movie is fantastic, very diferent in it's own way, i saw this movie on tv on IFC a long time ago & i just had to buy it, very entertaining, i can't say much about the movie because i would ruin it"
2,Committee book,"Microsoft's development groups appear not to talk to one another, and for Internet Information Server that longstanding bad habit is a critical problem. IIS intersects systems, programming tools and applications (Windows Server 2003, Visual Studio and Internet Explorer). The Resource Kit is written from a systems perspective and has little to say about the other main actors. With the introduction of Visual Studio 2005, release 2.0 of the .NET framework, Small Business Server R2 and most recently Vista the material is badly outdated.[...] As with other items written by Microsoft marketing staff, it is heavy on coverage, light on technical information and hard to use. Unfortunately IIS is a niche topic and so far has not attracted a skilled and knowledgeable writer who can integrate the several technologies and perspectives needed to explain it."
3,"Great songs, but not well produced","The correct track listing is: Strength to go through/Concrete jungle/Slave queen/Put it on/Zion chant/Black woman/Down in the valley/Joseph/Many are called/Sisters' chant. This is not my favorite Judy Mowatt album, because the production leaves a lot to be desired and her voice sounds thin and reedy at times. There are some great songs, however, like Strength To Go Through, Down In The Valley and Many Are Called. She also does interesting interpretations of Bob Marley songs like Concrete Jungle and Put It On. There is not enough variation in the sound. I think the use of different producers would have been a good idea. Still, the album is redeemed by some some strong material and should satisfy the fans. It's just not a reggae album with crossover pop appeal."
4,Great voice but a bit too crossover,"Judy Mowatt has a great, versatile voice; a bit too versatile, in fact, because this CD includes a more American-style soul than I would have liked from a Jamaican album.I totally understand. It was hard enough for women singers in Jamaica and with this album, Judy wanted to target a broader audience. Nevertheless, when it comes to the few female ""reggae"" singers, I prefer the purer roots sound of the Love Joys on the Wackies label."
3,Small print.....,"Nice book, a bit out of date. My real problem is the letter size, not easy to read..."
3,"sound advice for ""sound advice""","this isn't a bad book for the ""extreme"" novice. pretty basic book. at least the reader gets a CD for the examples so you actually hear something. not recommended other wise."
1,This Travel Mug Stinks!!!!!,Do not buy it leaks and it is very hard to drink out of. I checked out alot of travel mugs before I bought this and I was sorry I did. I had it one day and the lid leaked. I already returning it to amazon.
3,Just Ok,"I like it ok, it smells really good--it works for only about a week on my skin--best results after the first day, then after day four it's not as great, sooo--unlike it says, it isn't really a monthly mask, it needs to be used more like once a week. I've noticed that if you don't use enough, the results are minimal--so be sure to use a dollop about the size of a silver dollar.--Also this product seems to work best on people who don't have really oily skin, because just before my ""time of the month"" when I get soaked with oil--this product didn't help whole lot--it did help some--just not as much as you'd think it would"
4,great reggae mix,"I have been listening to reggae for years and this is one of my favorite old school mixes, great artists on it....If you like older reggea, this is the one..."
5,Excellent!,"Here we get 40 excellent Johnny Cash songs from the Sun Records period. These are all in excellent sound quality as well. You can't go wrong with this material at all.One questionable part of the release: The songs on the second disc are all in alphabetical order, except for two selections. This shows me that they put the main, best known, songs on disc one and threw the rest on disc two. It doesn't do anything for the enjoyment of the material, but where else have you seen that happen?There are simply too many good songs on these discs to NOT pick it up. If you want to dig deeper into Cash's Sun period, this is the place to go. Outstanding!"
4,Good for price,Decently made.Not much to say about this product.It does what it is supposed to do.Good product for the low cost
5,Seems well made,Seems solid enough. Fit my Nikon ProStaff 3-9 x 40 Black Matte Riflescope (BDC) without any problems. Would recommend to a friend.
4,"""POPS"" up...perhaps a little too well","These things are awesome! So they don't protect the lens from every environmental condition. But considering all other alternatives, these are the fastest and most dependable lens cover option. No need to fuss around with neoprene or bungee covers. With flip ups, your rifle is ready to deploy in a no time flat. Likewise, you'll never misplace your caps again.My only complaint is that these caps ""pop"" when they open. Depending on the range you hunt, these caps may be way too loud. You can open them quietly if you are careful. But when you are staring down a buck, you aren't always thinking about your lens caps. I'd hate to lose a shot because of my Pringles can lens covers.That said, these lens covers are nearly perfect. They look (although I feel like a tool/sniper-wannabe at the range) and perform great."
4,A charming history,"Well-done book documenting all of the local flavor that Beacon possesses in its history. The pictures are beautifully presented, and the writing is highly informative (consisting primarily of captions). After having grown up in Beacon, it was both gratifying and a little bittersweet to realize how much I didn't know about my own hometown. For anyone who is familiar with the picturesque Hudson Valley, this book will present a captivating story on how a small American city is born and begins to grow."
3,Interesting but Misleading,"This is an interesting collection of French and American erotic films. Unfortunately, the narration provides quite an inaccurate history of the subject. Turning the sound off enhances the quality of this collection, alas.Martin ShackelfordSaginaw, Michigan"
3,A Very Chaste,"This history of the origins of adult cinema, while short, is generally adequate as a history of sexual short films. However, for a film about erotica, it is remarkably chaste. It alludes to various filmed sexual themes and acts without really showing much at all. This is particularly strange in that the narrator often takes an amused tone to the puritanism of American adult cinema--this in a history that shows little actual sexual activity, cutting away whenever anything is about to happen. [...]"
2,Good collection heavily censored,Good cross-section of material. Heavily edited they appear choppy and they did not have a plot to begin with. Narrator babbles giving no insight or real knowledge. Cult Epics' Anno series has the complete version of many of these films and is a much better product.
3,Beautiful But Flawed,"Typical to a Martha enterprise, this book is well-conceived, thoughtful, and gorgeously produced. It contains a wide variety of meals, arranged according to season. This concept allows the cook to find recipes for foods that are fresh in the market and make the most of what is in peak flavor. The recipes include familiar dishes with new twists and unique dishes that tempt. Unfortunately, the recipes seem not to have been tested adequately, as sometimes the amounts were off or the cooking times were wrong. This seems to be a problem in some of the recipes presented in the Martha Stewart Living magazine. Also, ... not all of these dishes are exactly quick. The criticism about underseasoning in the dishes is valid; final products were at times quite bland. In a cookbook de-emphasizing fats, use of herbs, spices, and seasonings becomes important. For an experienced cook with a critical eye, this may be a source for ideas. ..."
2,Pretty? Yes. Tasty? Not Really,"The foods are beautifully presented and the ingredients are interesting and upscale enough that you can serve some of this stuff to guests with pride. Unfortunately, in general the recipes are under-seasoned (bland and one-dimensional) and don't taste nearly as good as the pictures might imply. Some of the recipes--fruit sushi and grilled fruit panini come to mind--are downright silly in addition to being time-consuming and not very appetizing. Overall, a good book to learn about presentation, but disappointing recipes."
1,Disappointing,"This is my first Martha Stewart book. I like her shows, and have previously tried two of her recipes (made one myself, tasted someone else's) which I both liked. The recipes in this book looked enticing and not too complicated. But the amounts and cooking times are off. There is so little fat that you are not frying or baking, yet not enough liquid to stew. So food burns easily. Nothing gets salted until the very end, and thus is not as tasty as it could be. If you cook with perfect, freshest ingredients (which Martha always recommends), maybe the results will be better. But I do not live in Napa Valley, and my ingredients, even those bought in expensive organic supermarkets, don't do the trick. Want healthy *and* tasty? Get Jacques Pepin."
4,"Not for the novice, but OK","This cookbook is not for the novice because some of the recipes could require knowledge of basic to intermediate techniques. However, if a cook has been cooking for a while, then the recipes in this book could be inspiring.Note: There are not photos for every single recipe but enough photos to inspire. So, if you need many photos, then this book may dissapoint. Also, the title is deceiving because I found some of the recipes to not be very QUICK!NOTE: Some of the recipes require using ingredients that most people might find ""non-standard"". In other words, some of the ingredients require a more advanced palate because they are not your average store-bought (and easy to find) supermarket ingredient. Example, not everybody likes watercress and radicchio or arugula---an acquired taste."
2,Not Up To The Usual Martha Standard,"I was disappointed in this book...Had high hopes....not really ""healthy"" recipes, imo, and the recipes are un-appealing. I've seen way better health-conscious cookbooks, shocked to see Martha miss on this one!!"
1,poor return policy,"If you attempt to return a product to this company, be prepared for a lengthy process. You contact them, get a return order special code, and then must wait to return the item. You cannot return it via regular mail. You must use UPS, etc. or they will not honor your return. They do not respond promptly to email. I would not recommend this company."
5,Unbelievable Classy Entertainment,"This is,without a doubt one of the most entertaining shows you will ever watch.Remember to breathe every so often so you don't pass out.For vintage classic,classy and funny presenters you can't find anything better. This includes all of the great comedy names at that time in entertainment.Some are listed on the credits and some are ""surprise"" guests.This is classy comedy without raw language but there is plenty of sexual innuendo about Frank.Everybody is fabulous but there are a few real standouts. Red Buttons is hysterical and Jonathon Winters kills the entire dais. They are all pretty much gasping for air from laughing so hard at Jonathon.When comedy was really king!"
1,Sounds like a bad copy,The product seemed to be like someone put it together themselves. Sound quaility was poor. You have to put the volume way up just to hear it. The packaging seems like someone is making copies of the original and selling them.
3,It's just OK.,There's no captioning which is tragic because the sound quality is just awful. I had my flat screen blaring at 95 and the audio was just barely understandable.
4,Size Issue,Never got a chance to try them. I wear 7 1/4-1/2 hat and these things didn't even come close to fitting. Almost thought they were children's size. I would love to try them in my size.
5,Reading Glasses,"It is the most convenient spectacle you can wear around your neck to make it accessible all the time. I opt for the shades (I also have the transparent and the tortoise shell ones) because it is harder to get lost. It is so non-obtrusive, I even forget I have one around my neck."
2,Not as nice as the clic reading glasses,"These are just OK, not great. I have 2 pairs of the clic readers and I love them. The sunglasses, however, are not as sturdy, the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and I just cannot endorse them. I am disappointed as I am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses. It's a shame."
3,Not useful for me.,"I absolutely love Clic glasses. I debated a while whether I should get the sunglass version. I did and am not using them. These are reading glasses only. Like all Clics, they sit around your neck to have at the ready when you need them. So if you want to use regular sunglasses for other activities, perhaps you could have them on a cord around your neck also so you can switch back and forth. Then perhaps you may need your regular Clics when you go inside. Theoretically, you could wind up with 3 pairs of glasses around your neck! Maybe Clic should consider making the sunglass version like a bifocal. That would alleviate some of the problem for me."
3,Use them out!,they are just good for outdoors use. I happened to forget my clear ones at a friend one day and had to use these for a few days also in the evenings.. they are heavy for the eyes indoors. Probably very nice in summer out in the garden or in the car.
1,defective product,I have several clic glasses. for some reason this one came in defective and it is too much trouble to return it to amazon (waiting 3 years for refund for a blender). They will not adjust so I can not use them.
2,"This must have been the Canadian prototype for ""Time Tunnel.""","To say this was low budget would be too kind. The stereotype acting is not stereotype enough. The stereotype actors are not stereotype enough. Let's face it; this whole stereotype project is not stereotype enough. If the budget was just a tad lower maybe this would never have been made.Basic premise is an attempt to look into the future and into the past actually forces the lab to go into the future and into the past. The lab is stuffed with good guy, bad guy, and screaming girl. The good guy does good things. The bad guy does bad things. The girl screams a lot. While back at the ranch, they talk of a lot about how they've lost the lab.This DVD is perfect for testing the fast forward option."
5,Great gift for the little artists you know!,"A ship's captain looks out over the bow of his boat. What has he sighted? It's up to your child's imagination to illustrate the rest of the story on this page of the Thrid Anti-Coloring Book. Each page offers a starting point for creativity and encourages children to design, create, consider possibilities. There are pages asking to design a billboard, to look into a fire, to draw what you think of when you hold a seashell to your ear. My school age children have loved Susan Striker's anit-coloring books over the years and I continue to purchase them as birthday gifts for young friends."
5,"Not just a coloring book, your kids make art ""creations""","This book is far superior to regular coloring books that just have you color in the lines without much thought.It truly does empower creativity. Rather than just coloring in a figure, kids are given prompts. One page has a theater stage with the request ""Design costumes and scenery for your favorite fairy tale."" Another says ""You have been asked to design new playground equipment for the park."" My daughter really got into these designs. When she finished the book she brought it to me and showed me her creations. They really are creations. She's drawn her ideal park, she's drawn a picture of the things she likes to do when sick in bed (and that gives me good ideas of how to entertain her the next time that happens).I'm buying one for each kid, since they really do become personal art books. We've used them for road trip entertainment too. Kids may zip through a regular coloring book within half an hour, but this one lasted us about 6 hours."
4,Third Anti-Coloring Book,"I remember being introduced to the concept of an anti- coloring book in the 80's & loved it! As an elementary counselor I enjoyed using the pages to stimulate conversation & watch what the children dreamed up. Now in 2009, I needed something similar to use at a nature summer camp & was excited to order it. However I think I would have been happier with a ""Science & Nature"" Anti-coloring book because lots of the pages didn't fit my need. In a generic sense, it's good & I'm sure I'll find many more uses for it at another time. I also thought the drawings of people were a bit rudimentary, (personal taste).This is great for rainy days, vacations & firing up someone's imagination, plus, many children LOVE to color & we shouldn't take that away from them!"
2,Not so much,"Despite the fact that this book has received glowing reviews from other readers I beg to differ.Mace's story is superficial and something you can probably compile from recruitment material that The Citadel, VMI, USMA, USNA, and USAFA doles out to prosective cadets/midshipmen. Her story lacks any kind of analysis or deeper thoughts. Just a rambling about what happened to her and the The Citadel class of 2002 during their Knob year.A military college/service academy is one strange and fascinating place both in its philosophy and rituals. Mace fails to really capture any of it.Since I am totally butchering this book I should give an alternative: ""Victor Padrini - a novel of the US Air Force Academy"" by Mark Pizzimenti is a much more interesting read and ""spoke"" to me, a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, a whole lot more than Mace's bland attempt at a ""hoorah"" for her school."
3,A woman's story of life in the Citadel,"Nancy Pace, the first female to graduate from The Citadel, the presitigousmilitary college in South Carolina, tells the story of her experience therein her new YA memoir, IN THE COMPANY OF MEN: A WOMAN AT THE CITADEL.Although the writing is passable, it's not top-notch--there's a lot of""telling"" and too little ""showing""--and there are some details left out thatmight have helped.HOWEVER, I do believe it will have an audience with younger high schoolstudents (and maybe middle schoolers, are though there are a few S and Fwords scattered throughout), and I recommend it on this list for thatreason. In the current national climate, there is likely to be more demandfor books about the military and training for it. I think this book isvaluable, especially for teen girls, because it depicts a woman successfullycompleting a rigorous, typically male-dominated course of study. Inaddition, she has ADD, and triumphs in spite of her troubles with schoolwork."
1,Golden Ticket to Ride,"I graduated from this wonderful institution known to all as The Citadel, to some as Pure Hell, and to the Mace's as their fumbling fortress. It is a total sham, everything in that book except for the names and locations. Those are true, but unless you were there at that time, or there at all, you will never get the truth. Conroy's Lord's of Discipline held more legitimacy than this book. And we all know when a book is written by 2 people, the first person spoke and the second person actually wrote.There has yet to be a truly accurate depiction of The Citadel- maybe someone with a little bit of INTEGRITY (part of what the Citadel stresses) will set the facts straight. Until then, this book may give a few good laughs, but all in all, its more of a wive's tale than anything else."
5,Great bass kick and a low profile speaker,"I bought these speakers because I needed a set that could rest on their sides under my multiple monitor setup. Any other speakers I found would block my view of my screens, but these can sit vertically or horizontally. (They are not designed as such, but it works.)These speakers have a nice kick for such a small package. Nice and heavy too so they won't skate across the desk or tip over easily. One of the ""must haves"" was a headphones jack on the speaker so I don't have to reach down behind the tower when I start a recording session and want to plug in my cans.One interesting feature that I will likely never use (but someone might) is what appears to be an input jack so that someone can play an MP3 player directly through the speakers without disconnecting them from the PC."
4,"Not that much bass, but enough bang for your buck.","I needed decent speakers that did not require a separate subwoofer and that didn't take up a ton of space. I also needed to have the capability of plugging in headphones or an external audio source like an mp3 player. These fit the bill. They may not have a lot of bass, but the sound quality is good and loud enough to hear across the room without being distorted like cheaper speakers. So I bought two more pair for my other computers.They're pretty good sounding speakers. They don't have that much bass, but I don't have room for a separate sub."
4,"Good sound, minimal cell phone interference","I purchased these speakers to replace an (old, crummy) set of speakers I use at work. The old speakers suffered terribly from cell phone interference; each time a phone within about 15 feet (walls notwithstanding) rang or checked in with a cell tower, I'd get a few seconds of buzzing. Happily, these Logitech speakers have well-shielded cables and don't buzz at all unless the cell phone is placed within a foot or so.The sound quality is quite good for speakers this size. They even sound good a low volume levels. The fact that there is no wall-wort (transformer) on the end of the cord is also a nice feature.I'd rate these as an excellent value for the price."
4,Great Quality and Value!,"This is no 5 channel speaker system, but perfect for the user wanting quality desktop sound from games and internet when you don't feel like wearing the headphones. I use for BF2142 with 64 voices and works wonderfully without waking up the rest of the house with vibration."
4,"Good for the price, but a little bulky","These have pretty good sound, considering they don't have a subwoofer, but they are larger than you might be expecting (check the dimensions). Also, don't expect them to just blow you away with loudness, either...not gonna happen."
3,Not the greatest,My old Labtec speakers were better.More control better bass. And they were cheaper.Had them 10 years. I could control both bass and treble.
4,Rich C,"Shopped around and was mixed on what really to buy, I have had several brands in the past all of which worked well, Wasnt really looking to spend a lot, Once again read the reveiws and these speakers seem to rate well, The the sound is pretty good and the volume is plenty loud for me, The overall quailty seems good.Overall pleased with them."
5,Great Computer Speakers...a little big,"The price was great, got them on Amazon. I guess I'm size challenged [I am a man, after all] but they just seem a little bigger than I visualized, don't have that much space on my desktop, they fill alittle more than I planned. But the sound is great. Do it."
3,Sounds like a tin box,"I have had these for a few years. Like is said, they sound like a tin box. The tone control doesn't do much, and there is hardly any bass. My old RCA Analog tv has better sound than these. So i mostly use my headset, much more pleasant. Spend a few more dollars and get something worth while."
3,too big,"Sound quality is good and prices are reasonable. Estimated my mind is a pair of small speaker. But now, compare with my laptop. The speaker is too large."
2,Unimpressive sound and volume,"Bought these based on the Amazon reviews to replace an 8-year old pair of fantastic low-end Harmon Kardon speakers that kicked the bucket. Very disappointed in these speakers. Sound has a tinny echo and sounds muffled, and changing 'tone' doesn't fix it, nor does multiple output devices (laptops, iPod, etc). Also, even with computer output volume at max, we still have to turn up the speakers to at least 50% volume or higher. Lastly, these are quite large for computer speakers, not small or unobtrusive. I don't even care too much about the size, more how horrible they sound. I wouldn't recommend buying these at all."
4,Improved sound at a reasonable price,"A nice set of speakers with enough quality for enjoying music and greatly improving the quality of sound from a small office TV. Although there is no booming bass, there is enough of it with the tone control in the maximum bass position to get some of the deep sounds on the movie channels, especially in a smaller area. An excellent choice for the money."
2,not the best that they have,"Sound quality is poor compared to the same product i have had for over 5 years now. These speakers are slow to respond, sound tinny, and out of the blue the bass will come alive all on its own. Volume switch has to be cranked to the halfway point just to get a peep out of them. The item description doesn't say it but I suspect that these speakers have been poorly refurbished. And therefore really put a dim light on any other Logitech purchase I will make in the future. Because it seems they are getting to be more of a Wal-Mart made in China brand than the quality product of past purchases. My best advice find a different product, even if you have to spend more, you will be happier elsewhere."
5,Great Speakers,"I wanted a pair of decent speakers for the laptop in our living room. For $25 the price seemed good since most of the reviews have been positive. They were very easy to set up (took just a minute to have them ready to go) and the build quality is very good. The sound from these speakers is great. If you need some inexpensive speakers to upgrade the music experience of your computer, these are great."
4,great speakers for the price,"I listen to a lot of different types of music, and these speakers sound great no matter what I'm listening to. Definitely happy with this purchase. Sound quality does suffer at max volume but they're super loud, so great for personal use like listening to music loud in your room."
3,Not bad for the price,"These speakers are decent enough for laptops that do not generate enough volume through their internal speakers IF you are watching tv shows streamed online or for DVDs. However, I would recommend something more expensive if your laptop is your primary music system.The sound does not handle bass at all well and that is a natural result of having no sub-woofer."
4,Good Speakers,The speakers have been pretty good so far - very nice sound quality for size. I only wish they were a little more aesthetically pleasing.
3,"These are okay speakers. Not great. Not loud. I need more sound quality, but they are very cheap...so not a waste in the end.",I would say get a more expensive set if its going to be your main source for music.
1,Don't Expect Customer Support from Logitech when they don't work,"I've purchased Logitech's X140 speakers and they didn't work within a week of purchase. They have to be turned up all of the way before a low tinny noise comes out, but there's almost no volume working. I then went to Logitech's website, which doesn't list the speakers at all in their technical support. I finally located the manual on the speakers, but found the file was corrupted when I tried to download. I went to their 'Contact Us' page, filled out a long form about the issue the speakers where having. Once complete they then force you to sign up for a new account before you can submit the issue to their customer service. You shouldn't have to give up your personal information in return for customer service. Absolutely awful."
1,The bass on these is terrible,"With so many people rating this product so high, I thought is was getting a higher quality product for a great price. Well, you get what you pay for and these sound terrible, especially the bass. If you need cheap speakers for your small children to play games, then these are probably ok, but if you want to listen to music, these are not the speakers for you. They sounded so bad that I called Logitech thinking that I just received a bad pair. They were very customer friendly and sent me a new pair, but they sounded just as bad."
1,Seemed like a good idea,The speakers arrived DOA. Just got a buzzing sound from them. I tested the computer with known good speakers and everything worked. So these were DOA. Seems like poor quality control.
1,Don't buy it,Don't buy it. these speakers have an integrated power supply with the amplifier circuit. I heard a constant buzz from both speakers whenever the speakers turn on louder or not.
1,Annoying hum/buzz is too annoying,"If these are going to sit on your desk, the constant BUZZ is too loud and annoying.The hum continues even if the volume is all the way down; it's a power supply issue, not an issue with the input signal. Buy something else."
5,great speakers,I bought these speakers to use with a new laptop. They sound really good and are a great value. Recommended.
3,logitech x140,"attractive speakers with average sound, good for everyday use however would not purchase if sole purpose is to listen to music on cpu- sound is a bit tingy with minimal base."
2,"Did not work initially, so quality is questionable","I was probably just unlucky, but these did not work initially when I received them. After shaking them and whacking them several times, they began functioning and have worked fine ever since (about 6 months). I decided not to send them back for replacement due to the hassle. However, I'm obviously concerned they will fail again.Other than the lack of reliability, I have no complaints. The quality is fine. They create plenty of sound for computer speakers, look nice, and don't take up too much space."
2,Underwhelming & Returned,"I was looking for a pair of speakers for use with my laptop. The sound quality wasn't nearly as good as what I expected based upon other reviews here, but what really frustrated me was the loud buzz that emanated from these speakers whenever they were powered on. No matter where I plugged them in or what was plugged into them they buzzed loudly.I'm wondering if the problem isn't with interference from the integrated power adapter since I've never had this problem with other PC speakers that do have an external wall-wart style adapter."
4,worth the money...great bargain,the speakers are well worth the money....loud and clear in sound........they are no frills but that is exactly what I wanted.....no frills and quality for the cost
5,Even better than I expected,I chose these speakers for my parent's computer so they can watch YouTube videos. I was pleasantly surprised at the volume produced and with a decent amount of bass from a 5 watt system. The audio quality is very acceptable.
3,"if you're buying it for work, consider this..","I use it at work to listen to music on headphones so I don't bother my coworkers listening to electronic all day.Well, these speaks have a few problems:1. audible physical click when you turn the knob to turn them on or off. neighboring coworkers may soon learn what habits they have that are bothering you.2. low hum is audible even with the volume all the way down, using headphones.3. even with the volume all the way down, you can still hear the sound enough to understand most of the words so if you want to quickly turn the volume down when adverts come on, you'll still hear the adverts.4. there's a low pop on the speakers when turning them on, too.I have not used the speakers much, or the input jack.for headphone use, other than the problems above, they work well."
1,Sending them back,"When I first got these speakers, I was pretty impressed. Nice looking, good sound, for only $25. However, after 2 weeks of moderate use, the left subwoofer began to buzz. Even the most modest bass would override the song with an annoying buzzing sound, making them worse than the tiny speakers in my pc. I read several reviews that made this seem a common problem. The only solution was to plug them into another power source, which did nothing to improve the problem.The Logitech website solution was to return them for a replacement, which is exactly what I am doing. I'm replacing them with another brand that is better manufactured.If you do opt for these speakers, save the receipt."
3,Not full range,"I bought these speakers based on the reviews... I was expecting these speakers to be full range but it lacks the bass that most speakers in this price range has. I must admit the mids are very good but it doesn't go as low as I thought. These are decent speakers, but for the money, I would have gone with a 2.1 setup instead. My fault for not testing these speakers prior to purchasing."
5,best deal on amazon,"I bought these for my computer at work but I am back on the site buying another set for home. There is not anything that I don't like about these speakers. What I do like: they are $26 so they qualify for super saver shipping as a stand along item, they are 2.0 speakers and have incredible sound, the volume controls are right on the front so they are easily accessible. Also, they just have a regular plug meaning that they power converter is inside the speaker so when you turn them off they are off, there is not still a big power box plugged in that is 200 degrees and pulling power at all time. Highly recommended."
4,Great sound out of a small package.,"Very good sound and quality for the value. Although larger than anticipated, the sound quality that comes out of these speakers is very good. Good bass and treble and I like how the controls are on the front. For someone looking for a comparable sound to a 2.1 system but does not want the sub-woofer..I would recommend these speakers."
4,Good for the money,"Just like the title says they are good for the money. They are not Bose like nor are they cheap ""comes with the computer speakers"". They have a fairly wide range, but sometimes you need to adjust the tone based on the song. I paid $33 for them and I think that it was worth the price.One Con is the wiring on the back is a lot and hard to hide if you need to."
5,Very Happy,I feel these speakers are a very good value as they sound nice and full - not tinny or cheap. Cant find any faults in the sound. It is also very nice to plug them directly into the wall with no heavy power supply. Very happy with them - and with the fast free shipping. Buy with confidence.
5,Highly Recommended,"I bought these about a month ago, and am very pleased with them. I was listening to my Toshiba laptop speakers before these, and the contrast is night and day. I listen to a lot of jazz, and an acoustic bass actually has some weight to it, not just mud. These are not ""high fidelity"" by any means, but impressive sound quality for the size nonetheless, just don't expect to play them loud. They stand stable enough on the desk, and seem to have enough heft to remain upright. The ""Tone"" control, btw, is actually a ""Bass"" knob, where the bass increases as you turn it clockwise. I just leave it at 12 o'clock. My only criticism concerns the power-on light, which is way too bright and rather annoying, but that was easily solved with a 7/16"" dot of black electrical tape.I've used several different models of speakers over the years, and these probably provide the best sound for the money of the bunch. Highly recommended, and an excellent value for your $25."
3,Medium loud and semi-good quality,"The Logitech X-140 speakers do work well enough to fill a small room, but don't expect to fill a larger room or to blast the dust off the walls. Non-audio connoisseurs listening thought the sound quality was great, although to my ears they were lacking in high and low end. The tone knob does almost nothing, but the basic sound quality is fairly good without adjustment. I like the regular electrical on them as opposed to a wall wart on many speakers. The speakers are big and not very portable but they are luggable. For the price they do a good job of sharing a computer audio output with a dozen listeners."
4,Excellent set of speakers for the money,"These speakers are relatively tall (about the size of a quart of milk) with a wide base. Features I like:* No separate power supply - plugs straight into an outlet with what seems to be a 4' cord (6' would have been nicer, hence 4 stars instead of 5 for ""ease of use""* fairly sturdy build quality. The fairly thick metal mesh in front of the speakers does a good job protecting them from any harm.* pretty heavy. They won't topple over very quickly* sound quality is good. Maybe not hifi, but these are $25 speakers with built-in amplifier. I don't expect miracles; just something that is better than what my pc (laptop) can offer. And that they do. Unlike the built-in laptop speakers these ones don't wear me out after an hour when listening to music while working.What I like less:* It would have been nice if the speakers had little ""L"" and ""R"" labels--nice to know for gaming. I guess I'll figure it out soon enough. That's about my only gripe right now."
5,solid purchase,"I have a great lcd tv with one exception, the audio gave off a decided hum, i tried several relatively inexpensive speakers with little or no success,that is until i found these babies,audio problem solved. thanks so much"
4,Great pc speakers for a great price!,"I bought these speakers for my new desktop to replace the ones I had that were over 5 years old. I was pleasantly surprised by the tone quality, even when turned up to the loudest setting. The sound is very clear and the speakers didn't rattle at the highest level. As expected, these speakers lack in the lower ranges, but are balanced for any music played through your pc. If you're looking for that ""thump"", you may want to move up to a speaker set with a woofer (2.1). Overall, I'm very pleased with the Logitech X-140 speakers and would recommend them to others."
2,Nothing special,"I bought these for $15, and they're very underwhelming.Pros:$15 (would not pay more)Cons:Big - they won't fit behind your monitor unless you move it forward. I personally don't care about this, but I see many others who would like to put their speakers behind their monitor.Sound - they sound very tinny. I've had them on for about three hours, just in case there was a burn in period. They still sound tinny.For $15, I won't complain too much, but I would NOT pay more for them."
2,Poor quality,"These Logitech speakers look and feel good quality, but they have a loud hum when plugged into the line jack. My previous speakers did not have this issue. The bass speakers had a great amount of static when playing music. I am returning them and will not buy Logitech speakers again. If you want good quality, you will need to spend more money on a better brand."
5,great product,"Excellent sound. I am very happy with this purchase. I am not an audiophile, but this has a good bass response across a wide range, and the sound is clear and crisp."
2,"Love Logitech, but....","I bought these for my massage office. I read all the reviews that said the volume was poor. I thought since I was using them for ""light music"" in the office they would work fine. I had always had good luck with logitech. When I played my mp3 with them I had to turn it up to full volume and if you walked more than 5 ft. away, you could not distinguish the song playing. I plugged my son's Itouch into them and the sound was a little better (louder) still had to have the volume ALL the way up. The radio was slightly better than the mp3, but worse than the itouch. I plan to send them back. Very disappointed, because always liked the brand."
4,Little Speakers Big Sound,I have bought TWO sets of these speakers. I have taken them to work with me and they are great. I needed a set of speakers to be louder than the background noise and these do it. The price is incredible and I am able to play them at high volumes for long periods of time without any ill effects.
4,cheap speakers sound ok!,"I forgot what I paid for these but I seem to recall they were just over $20. Obviously they are not terrific speakers and not priced as if they were. I think they sound OK given they are cheap. The bass/treble control helps round out the sound, but when the volume gets a little high they start to distort. I wish now I had spend another $20 and gotten speakers with a sub-woofer. So, if you don't need anything fancy you might consider these but I believe you could do better by spending a few more dollars, especially if the sound quality is important. These are currently being used on my wife's computer, I don't have any on mine right now because both the computers are in the same room, so she just puts on music for us both to hear, we will upgrade later. these do have a built in amplifier and I like the metal screen fronts on them."
3,"Decent sound, bad cord layout","They sound and look fine, but the design of the cords doesn't make sense. The power cord is attached to one speaker, while the speaker cord to the computer is attached to the speaker. Really? Why would they assume that a computer doesn't have power near it, and put the power cord on the other end? Now i have two cables running across my desk instead of just one."
1,These speakers sound terrible,"I understand that you get what you pay for but I expected a better product from logitech. I've purchased their speakers before and I found that, for the most part, they at least sounded decent. These sounded absolutely awful. No bass response at all - when the bass kicked in, the sound was totally distorted. I bought these from a chain retailer and ended up bringing them back right away."
3,Solid but average performance,"Average but solid performance, no great bass range but otherwise good for the office (where i use them)."
4,"Nice speakers, great price.","I am very pleased with these speakers. They are solidly built, look good, and offer nice sound at a very reasonable price. I'm sure you could get superior,concert-quality audio from a more expensive model, but these are more than adequate for my purposes."
1,Constant hum/buzz right from the start,"These are being returned right away. The sound quality is horrible. I bought them because they were one of the only PC speakers to feature a headset jack anymore. They're not worth it. As other reviewers have said, there is a constant very loud buzzing as soon as you turn them on, even when the volume knob is turned all the way down. I agree that the sound is flat and muffled. I've used my headset on all kinds of other devices and speakers and they have always sounded great, so I know it's not that.Now I have to try and find another pair of speakers that has a headset jack...."
5,High Quality & Inexpensive,"$25.00 SpeakersThese are wonderfull, warm sounding speakers worth Double the Price!I use them with my Mp3 on the counter in the Kitchen.My Comparison is my $9500.00 Living room Stereo.Very Good for 3 Times the Price! Gary"
1,Really Tinny Sound,"I picked these up for my desktop with the hope of just getting some reasonable sound, nothing loud, no pounding base. Unfortunately these speakers have a really tinny sound to them, just not good quality, I'm still seeking a good alternative."
3,Tinny,"I bought these speakers based upon the reviews I read on Amazon. They were described as excellent low volume speakers with good quality and appearance. The quality and appearance are both very good, however, the sound quality is hardly better than the sub-ten dollar set of unamplified plastic boxes that typically come with a new computer from an independent builder. This was especially disappointing as I've come to expect Logitech products to be considerably better than mere price would indicate.These speakers simply are below par by anyone's measure. They sound tinny at any volume and are certain to leave the purchaser wondering what Logitech was thinking about when it decided they were worth marketing. Don't buy these. I have had sets for the same or lower prices from other manufactorers which far out-preform them. Look around."
4,Nice 2.0 Speakers at a good Price,I didn't have room for a sub woofer so wanted 2.0 speakers. These met my price range and sound pretty good with decent bass and overall good sound. If you want rally great sound go with 2.1 speaker system but these ork very well when space is an issue.
2,Mr. Negative Says Don't Bother,"There is just not enough oomph to these things, even though they have a separate power supply, to make a difference. I say get some real speakers or live with your built in ones."
1,Terrible Sound,"I didn't have huge expectations for these speakers - I realize that they were at the entry-level price point - but these are horrible! I have to turn the volume up on the computer, itunes, and the speakers in order to hear anything. I liked the fact that they had an input on the speaker and that you could turn them off without unplugging them. I wish they were better."
2,Good...not great,"Maybe I am spoiled after coming from a Logitech x-5500 setup but these speakers are pretty disappointing. The sound quality is slightly better then a set of OEM Polk speakers I was given. I recently moved to a much smaller house and didn't think I needed the sound for the larger X-5500 speakers. The X-140 sound very tinny and if you turn the volume anywhere about a quarter turn, you start to get distortion. I would keep looking if I had had a chance to try these first."
4,Good value,"Purchased these for my office - wanted to be able to listen to some streaming audio from the web and to connect my ipod. They are larger than I expected but still a good size - I guess I could have checked the dimensions! Regardless, for the price paid these are great. I don't think you should expect them to blast a room with clear sound for $30! They were perfect for my application."
5,Wonderful High Quality,"I have had these speakers for about 4 years now. They are still performing as if brand new. My kids have blasted them to the fullest with music and they are still performing above par. Excellent for ipods, mp3 players, and computers. Very good, long lasting, high quality speakers. I highly recommend them. A must have."
5,Just What I Needed,"I was looking for a good, inexpensive set of speakers for my desk at work, and these surpassed what I was expecting."
2,Quality issue - every beat buzzes; this one's going back.,"I have a Logitech 2.1 setup (the Z-4 I think) and have been happy with the performance. We needed a smaller 2.0 set for another computer, and got the X-140 based on the positive reviews.We must have gotten a lemon, because there's an annoying buzz in the right-side speaker, like distortion on every beat. Sounds like a torn speaker. Also overall volume is very weak - need to turn it up 2/3rds for a decent listening level, and then the distortion problem is far worse.From what we can tell, buzzing aside, the sound quality is mediocre at best. Again, it may just be that our unit is defective and not like the others; but honestly these don't sound much better than the ""free"" garbage speakers that came with PCs a decade ago.We plugged the Z-4 into the new computer and everything was as expected, so it's clearly the X-140 that's causing the problem. We're returning it for a refund and won't take a chance with the cheaper Logitech units again."
4,Finally! Loud enough!,Previous sets had very low volume--very frustrating! This set has plenty of volume. Only 'con' is that they're quite heavy.
2,"Very big, pulsing sound","When I first got them I was surprised at how heavy the package was, if your looking at buying these make a note that they are very big. They are tall and weigh more than your average speakers. I've had these for a few months now and already I'm starting to notice a pulsing sound whenever they are on."
2,poorly shielded design,"I bought these speakers to use with my MacBook Pro about a year ago. The sound quality is pretty good for when you're sitting at the desk; the bass is decent, and the trebles sound crisp. However, the speakers consistently pick up signals from area radio stations and other hums/buzzes; this happens regardless of whether they are plugged into the computer or not, so it seems to be the speakers themselves that are poorly shielded and picking up these signals. At times, it's loud enough to be quite audible and quite distracting. Logitech, please shield your components more carefully in the future!"
3,"Good highs and features, but bass is muddy","Pros:Look goodHeadphone jackEasy to setupNo big ac adapterGood length cordsGood volumeGood highsCons:Bass is very muddy. If you are at all use to a 2.1 system, this one is going to disappoint. It just can't great the rich clean lows that a 2.1 system can unfortunately. But I suppose this is what you can get for 27.00 and such small speakers. They do beat laptop speakers and most ipod speakers though. I personally though find the bass to be just too irritating to like these speakers too much. Maybe considering going back to 2.1 system."
5,Spectacular Speakers!,"I just got these, tremendous sound quality, great bass function. Spectacular speakers for the price. It is made by a great company, they are perfect!"
5,great item for cost,This was a cheap set of speakers that look great and do exactly what I wanted them for. Shipped quickly. Very happy with them.
1,broke after 1 year,working fine for 1 year and then it broke - would not power on and even if it did only for very low volumes
3,"too tinny, no bass","There is no reason for so many high reviews. The Logitech 140 speakers have good mid-range, may be ok for classical music or acoustic, but for any modern music with amplified bass they will sound very tinny and underpowered. My original speakers are Logitech s220 2.1. When I compared the 140s I couldn't believe how much worse they were, absolutely no bass. I understand that no 2.0 will compare to a 2.1 system with sub-woofer. The only excuse for these speakers is portability. If you are going to have fixed speakers in one place, buy a 2.1 system."
4,Logitech X-140 Speaker,"Bought as a gift for a 16 YO son out of state. I haven't heard the speakers, but my son is very pleased with them. He uses them as room speakers with a Walkman CD vs. as PC speakers."
2,Worked for awhile...,"I was excited to receive these speakers due to the good reviews that I had read. The speakers worked fine with my new computer for a couple of months. Now, the sound is awful and the mix is out of whack. I wish I had better things to say about this set. I'm looking for a new set now."
3,The Balance has a problem,"This speaker has a good design.But here is a important problem.When this speaker arrived at my home,I settled and connected my an equipment.But I was surprised at not hearing one speaker.So I went into connected equipment manager mode.I arranged the balance of sound.I think that the speaker must be work well without controlling connected TV, PC and so on.Anyway I am using well.This speaker has a good sound quality.I recommend that a factory should consider the balance of left and right sound.This speaker is actually 5 stars, but I gave 3 stars because of this problem."
2,Misleading,I think to be fair that this is really a complaint to Amazon.com because I did a search for USB speakers and these speakers that I bought are not USB. This was a grave disappointment especially since I paid about a whopping 15 dollars for shipping and handling and if I decided to return them I would have to pay a similar amount which would have ended up being more than the cost of the speakers.Too bad...I hope Amazon.com is more careful...I am considering not using Amazon.com again
3,Good speakers for the price.,The sound was not what I anticipated it would be. It needs more bass tones for the deeper sounds to enjoy.
2,Not loud enough.,I have bought other speakers before and they have all been excellent for sound. These speakers however are not loud enough for my bedroom TV. They have a great sound but just not loud enough. They may be great for desktop computers or other devices that are less than 10 feet from you. I would recommend them for computer games and such but not for TV speakers at all.
4,These speakers are the truth!!!,"These speakers are so loud, crisp and clear sounding that I was able to hear different sounds that I never notice before with different songs. The bass is heavy but not like 808's, the treble vibrates cooly and the speakers look great too."
3,Poor,"These speakers are very poor. I always buy Logitech speakers but these are the worst i have ever purchased, very tinny and the auxiliary port is nothing short of pathetic.I will continue to buy Logitech but will be more careful of reviews.I did""nt pay much ($30) did""nt get much."
2,Simple Adjustment Possible,"May produce abrasive, harsh sound quality. Prefer natural warm sound. I installed soundcard with EQ (Zonar DG); set the DB at zero for 30-250Hz, and flatened 500Hz-16KHz. Set speaker tone knob more bass. Useful improvement."
2,Poor sound quality,"I wasn't expecting too much at this price and I was very satisfied when I did a quick test with my phone as the input. Next I hooked it up to my desktop and tried the ""left channel right channel"" voice test (from the Creative audio console). Awful. The right channel is completely distorted, even at 20% volume (fiddling with tone also helped a bit, but not much).I'm guessing I got a lemon and they're not all like this, but for $25 I'm not going to bother returning it. I'm simply going to nurse a grudge against Logitech speakers."
2,Worked great for a few weeks...,"Was very happy with the purchase initially, but, after a few weeks, the left speaker started producing a static-like hissing and wouldn't stop--even if the audio input was unplugged or connected to a different source. Haven't had any problems with Logitech products before, and would assume that this isn't a normal occurrence."
4,Good Product,Not the best speakers out there but they aren't priced as if they were. They did exactly what was needed for the job; kids computer. Good buy for s small budget.
2,Nasty ground loop,"I tried the Logitech X-140 speakers with my Chumby. I'm not an audiophile, by any definition, but the Chumby's internal speaker just does not cut it. While the sound from the X-140 was good when the Chumby was playing music, when it was not being used, there was a nasty ground loop hum that was loud enough that disqualified it from its role as my alarm clock (the hum would have kept me awake).Ground loop problems can often be blamed on the other device, but in this case, the Creative T10 that replaced the X-140 doesn't have this problem, nor did the speakers I was using with the Chumby before."
4,Works as it should,Pros: Should be childproof with it's metal shields.Has a plug-in for earphones.Cons: None yet except that I wish I got this earlier instead of spending $300 on a stereo system
5,"For the price, you can't beat 'em",I recently got a new Dell pc and stupidly didn't upgrade the stock speakers. I received this dreadful strip that attached to the bottom of the monitor and it emitted the most wretched sounds I have heard in decades. I definitely needed something different but didn't want to spend a lot. The reviews on these Logitech speakers looked good so I gave them a try. They are terrific! You can't go wrong with these.
3,Logitech x-140,"These speakers are pretty good for the non audiophile, which is the main reason why I returned them. I was actually surprised with the bass output, especially for a set of computer speaks that don't come with a ""sub"", sub in quotations because computer subs are like 2 in and barely put out more bass than my butt hole. but like all logitech speakers, i've found that they have a very muddy sound. Once i boosted the high eq, they sounded much better, and i almost would've liked them, had it not been for the very loud buzzing sound coming from the speakers when idle. I've bought and tried, just for fun, every logitech computer speaker system available at Best Buy/Target/Walmart and i haven't liked any of them. If you like a wide sound spectrum (deep lows to clear highs and everything in between) i'd just stay away from anything logitech.but if you're not a sound snob they'll be fine for you, especially since they're only $15 at Target."
3,just ok,"I got to say these speakers are not bad, but it's not quite something I expected. First of all, bass sound is quite good. but the problem is high / mid. high sound isn't clear at all, mid tone is kind of missing something, I don't know what to put that to explain. I haven't decided yet to return it or not. It's not like I don't like this, it's a good product with this price here in amazon. And one more tip, if you can afford to pay a little more, JBL duet speakers are good. I still have it and I love it. Hope this'll help you."
5,"Amazing Speakers, lousy online description","Logitech X-140 2.0 SpeakersI love the speakers they deliver a clear, true sound from the pc and from the MP3 player. They are slim, nice to look at and take up less space then the chunky speakers that come with most computers.However, they need a 3.5 mm male to male cable to connect to the MP3 player and the website does not tell you that it is not included or that you even need one. I knew one was needed, unlike a lot of non computer savvy folks, but assumed that the cable was included. I ended up having to hit Wal-Mart to get the cable. Not a major issue, but still annoying."
1,Constant radio interference,"I needed new speakers for my PC and got these in a hurry - they looked good, I knew the brand, they were cheap but not too cheap... well, this is going to be one of those DO-OVER purchases and I'm going to have to write these off as a loss. The sound quality is poor, which would be tolerable were it not for the CONSTANT radio interference. When I listen to music at medium volume, I can hear radio stations loud enough to make out words and lyrics. If I turn the music down, the radio nearly drowns it out. There's no escaping this. I've never had this problem with speakers before. Now it's back to the drawing board! Shameful that these crappy speakers are so positively reviewed."
2,Not too great.,"I know that these are just cheap speakers, but I had hoped that they might sound a little bit better than they do. There is a lot of mumbo-jumbo on the package about how the bass is great in spite of the small size of the speakers, but in the end they look a lot bigger than they sound. They are not very loud, even when turned up all the way."
3,Lacking,"I'm picking when it comes to audio, and after reading all of the reviews, I bit. I'm not hearing the rich mids like others are reporting -- but then again, maybe I am expecting much of speakers that only cost 20 bucks."
5,Speakers,The logitech speakers were the best I bought. I would bye them again if need be. I wish the cord were longer
5,Great PC Speakers,"I purchased these to replace a set of Yamaha speakers I had for several years. Based on my use of other Logitech products I decided to try these. They are excellent , provide great sound for limited space and are solid. Well built with metal mesh grill inserts and heavy duty volume and tone switches. Headphone jack and external jack as well. For the price you can't beat these."
4,Set Up is a snap.,"I bought these speakers to provide better audio for a small LCD TV in my kitchen that had inadequate speakers, making it very difficult to hear it across the room. The setup for the speakers was a snap. Just place them where you want them and plug in to the nearest electrical outlet and insert the 3.5mm jack into the headphone receptacle. You are ready to go. Just turn on the volume control and adjust the tone to you liking. Now I don't need to turn the volume up to max on the TV to barely hear it. The sound from these speakers is crisp and more than adequate volume. I would have rated 5 stars if the speakers had been a bit less bulky. All in all I am very happy with the purchase."
2,"these speakers are about 12"" tall, about 3"" wide, and take up about 4""x3"" of desk space because of the base size",the speakers are okthey are larger than I was expecting... next time I'll do the cm to inches conversion before placing the order
5,Loud with good quality at a good price,"Perfect little speakers for my home computer, the audio port in is a plus, good quality sound at a good price."
3,Not so loud,"For the size of the speakers I was hoping for some loud volume, but instead it is pretty mediocre. Although it is nice that it has an aux jack."
4,Excellent!,"For the price, these speakers are great! They're not the most beautiful sounding, but through headphones, they're wonderful! Our goal was to replace our Bose speakers that had some headphone issues. Now, out 7 year-old son can plug his headphone directly in without the speakers sliding around and scratching our monitor. They do the job for the price and sound great through headphones!!!"
3,somewhat below expectations,"I admit I primarily bought these because of the price and other reviews praising their ruggedness. Time will tell how durable these are. I am a little unhappy that the speakers and all the wires are permanently fixed. When you have a desktop computer and all the cables and wires that go with it. It is nice to be able to unplug everything and sort out the mess. Not an option with these. The two speakers are permanently connected with an audio wire. The audio input wire is permanently connected to one speaker and the power cord is fixed to that speaker as well. One good thing is that there is no cumbersome power brick transformer.The other disappointment is the sound quality. I've had other cheap 2.0 powered computer speakers in the past that were smaller and sounded better. The sound is eather too tin-y or too cardboard boxy depending how you adjust the tone knob. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a sweet spot in the middle."
2,great sound: shoddy craftmanship BEWARE,I've had these speakers for about one year and they literally stopped worked round the 6month mark... one of the speakers stopped working(IT HAD A shortcircuit in the cord and would flicker on and off). This happend from nothing more than normal wear the speakers litterally sat undisturbed on my desk for 6months until they stopped working suddenly one day. I've been using just one speaker for a while(nearly 6 months now)... there is absolutely nothing wrong with the sound the speaker produces... its wonderful! its unfortunate that the shoddy craftmanship in one of myspeakers has made it necessary for me to buy another! AVOID THESE IF YOU CAN!!! THE PRICE IS DECEPTIVE!!!
4,Much better than Cyber Acoustics speakers,"I recently owned Cyber Acoustics CA 3602 computer speakers. They were poor quality, and didn't last long. Replaced them with these Logitech X-140 speakers, and what a difference. It's like upgrading from a Kia to a Volvo. Logitech X-140 speakers are better in every respect: great looks, cleaner sound, solid feel. They are actually bigger in size than I expected from the photos, but not huge. Plenty of bass for my needs. Great value for the price. Definitely recommend to others."
5,Awesome!,"These speakers are awesome. GREAT sound quality, I couldn't believe it. Although they are not going to blast sound throughout an entire house, they are great for listening to music on your computer, a small party, or for working out (you get the point). Highly recommend these."
5,"Sounds great, low price","These are much, much better than the freebie speakers that come with typical computer systems. Both the lows and highs are much more realistic both for speaking and music."
4,Impressed with quality,"I bought these as a low-cost replacement for my son's computer. They are larger than I thought, but solid and very clear sounding. The tone changes the bias between bass and treble a bit. They are plenty loud enough also. The reason for losing a star is that there are quite a few 2.1 systems (with a subwoofer) for around the same price. I just didn't want to hear bass from my kid's room."
4,Great Value,"Muy bueno! Great value for the price. I'm sure there are better quality computer speakers out there (more expensive), but for the money, I think these are hard to beat. The sound quality is terrific, deep, rich, sound (adjustable & 120 volt!). If you're looking for a medium priced, great sounding set of speakers for your computer, I don't think you can do better than this Logitech set. As a casual listener to satellite radio, I'm completely satisified with the sound quality."
5,Logitech X-140 2.0 Speakers,I have these speakers on my computer at work and they are great. Easy access volumn control and headphone jack when you don't want to disturb your neighbors in the cubicle farm.Ordered on Monday and received them on Wednesday.Great price....Best bang for the buck...
4,logitech speakers,"good looking speakers good sound quality,a little large for my desktop but well worth the price"
3,Decent but not replacement for 2.1 speaker,"I have this about a month. The first thing I notice from this speaker is that it's heavier than it look. It's heavier than it suppose to be from the price we pay. Thus, it really makes me feel like this speaker (Logitech X-140) is built with quality. However, the second thing i notice is that ""when I turn on, it makes a loud high pitch sound"". It loud enough making me blink my eyes even though I already know what to expect after a week of using it. The sounds is decent but not great. It lost some details in mid-tone and high.I use it for my laptop because I don't want so many sound system in my room. The lines are long enough for desktops, too.Originally, I was going to return it but I got lazy. The loud high pitch turn-on-sound is extremely annoy. My laziness makes me bear with it or just simplely leave it ""on"" forever."
2,Sound Quality Not That Good,"The sound quaintly is poor overall. No separate bass/treble control. Lack adequate bass. You might say they sound ""tinney"" for the money. Construction quality is good."
5,Logitech,"Can't beat these for the price! I keep the bass turned all of the way up and they sound great for watching Internet TV and are respectable for music at a nominal volume. They're actually plenty loud, but keep in mind that they weren't designed for rocking the house. They're heavy made units with the transformer built into one of the speakers so you don't have the wall wort taking up space in the outlet. The sound is a good clean quality tone and I doubt many will be disappointed, at least for their intended purpose. ""If you're just looking for a good quality pair of computer speakers you can't go wrong with these."""
3,"Not bad, not great",I purchased these speakers for a TV because another reviewer said that they were good for voice. He was correct and they're nicely balanced for voice and dialog but they're not quite loud enough. They are also a bit larger than expected.
4,Good quality for its price,"Good quality sound at a reasonable price. Manages to convey some oomph in the bass despite the relatively small size. The volume knob is a little stiff for part of the motion, and the volume knob doubles as power (I'd prefer a separate switch so I can maintain a volume setting but turn it off), but I'm still happy with it."
4,Very good speakers for low price,"These speakers provide good sound considering the size. They don't have the heavy bass of larger speakers or subwoofers but for daily use, they are great for music."
4,OK for the price,"These speakers sound OK for basic computer speakers, so if you want really good sound these will not suffice, although they sound better using headphones plugged into them. They sound much better than integrated speakers, which is what most people are looking for at this cost, so I recommend them because of that."
5,5 years and counting...,"I've had this model for about 5 years now, and they've been thru some hard times...very hard times...and they are still as good as the first day I bought them...the sound is great, and they are built like german tanks. I could probably use them around the house instead of a hammer and they would still work smoothly...of course there are a lot of features missing but for this money I would prefer rock solid built and good sound over sophistication that lasts one day after the warranty expires. By the way I was just browsing electronics and I saw them and I just had to leave a review. It's my first one ever. I'm just too pleased with them not to share my good experience with other people."
3,Average,"For the price it is a good buy. Sound quality is average and a vast improvement over the junk sent out with most computers. I am happy with this product and glad to endorse it. My computer is not my sound system, so for P.C. use this is perfect."
4,Basic speakers,I needed basic speakers for a user in our office. No problem setting up. Serves it's intended purpose. I cannot evaluate quality of sound but user has not complained.
5,Logitech X-140 Speakers,High quality speakers for the price. Well-built housings and very well shielded cables. Sound quality very good.
5,Can't Go Wrong,"These are, hands down, the best computer speakers for the money on the market. I have them at both home workstations and music sounds beautiful in the offices at background levels and above. I am so satisfied with them that I recommended them to friends, who use them with their MP3 players to provide background music in their living rooms.Heavy magnets, very well built, and full featured. At under $30, how can you not want a pair of these?"
4,"Small footprint, but Big on Sound","This is a suitable selection when you want to appreciate your music, but don't have a lot of desktop space, or just don't like a lot of clutter. The ""Z"" design of these speakers makes this possible.The sound from these speakers is quite distinctive because of its double speaker design. Each speaker unit has:- 1 Mid-range to upper-range speaker- 1 Mid-range to lower-range speakerThe Fequency Response of these speakers is: 80Hz - 18kHz. The total peak power output is 10 watts. There is an adjustable tone control that can yield a greater degree of bass, however, it should be noted that it will not sound like a sub-woofer.This unit can also be easily connected to any other sound source via its 3.5mm stereo jack. It is a good product to consider if you are looking for good value for money."
3,not as good as i hoped.,"i have a pair of 7 year old altec-lansings which came as original equipment with my compaq presario. i had hoped to be able to move up a bit in speaker quality, but it wasn't to be. i found the old set to have a slightly sweeter quality across the range of material that i use them with. i passed the logitechs on to a grandson who happened to have a need for a pair of self-powered speakers. they are better than nothing especially for gaming types."
4,Good speakers!,"These speakers are a good product for the money. Clear sound, doesn't take up much desk space...love having the output/input jacks on the front of the speaker. I had some other speakers and ordered these for a co-worker and ended up giving him my ""old"" speakers (which were only 1 yr old, and in the same price range)and keeping these!"
4,Good speakers for small room,Good sound in small size work very well in a small room at lower volume settings. Sound is clean and bright.Music is clean and voices are not muted.
1,Not wireless per search topic,"This came up first for wireless with good rating and great price point, when I searched for wireless. It is not wireless!!!! Don't know how well it works because I'm returning it."
2,Ugly sound comparing with x-540,"Comparing X-140 with X-540 (that I bought a few years ago and I'm very happy about) - X-140 sounds extremely bad. Bought X-140 for my daughter's PC, hoping to hear something close to X-540. Big mistake. X-140 has very bad high tones - low ones are bad too. Dynamic is poor. Speakers sound like speakers installed in a cheap bus (maybe because they are cheap). Cannot recommend."
2,Be carefull,This is - as the only product I have purchased for the last year on amazon - NOT dualvoltage. This info is nowhere to be found on neither Amazon or Logitech web. If you think of going to Europe - don't buy this. So if anyone is in the market for a pay of unused speakers...
2,eh.,I bought these speakers based on the stellar reviews and the price. I'm not really all that impressed.
1,horrible sound quality,Save yourself the money. They are priced cheap for a reason. The speakers sounded horrible from day one- a buzz/hum (is that the bass? I don't know) is louder than whatever you are trying to listen to.
2,Sounded Good While They Lasted (for a couple of months),Wires are too short if you want to move them away from your PC. Knock them over or trip on the wire it's all over. Can't fix yourself because there aren't any screws.
3,Awfully quiet,"I bought these for my workshop so I could listen to music off my mp3 player while I work. The sound is okay, but there is not much projection to them. I have to crank the volume to max just to hear them across the room. These are inexpensive, so I know I get what I pay for, but if I had it to do over again I would probably get something more expensive."
4,Amazing Buy for the Amazing low price,The headphones are pretty remarkable for the price. They produce amazing sound for the price although i did notice some crackling at very very very high volumes but that shouldn't be a problem for most.
2,So-So Speakers,"I bought these because they were inexpensive -- just for my son to listen to youtube videos on and also audiobooks at bedtime. The sound quality makes me wish I'd spent another ten bucks on the next level speaker. There is only clarity at a fairly low volume. A bit disappointing. Also, you do not need to purchase the ""customers who bought this also bought"" items. Everything you need is in the box."
3,"Had better, had worse....","These speakers are okay for the price. They don't sound amazing, they crack a little (okay, a lot) when played too loud. I use these in a setting where playing them loud is what I usually do, so it's a bit of a struggle with sound quality. I wouldn't buy them again, but I'm not rushing out to find new ones either."
4,Great Speakers,"Love these speakers! Perfect for my new computer, I've had them about a month and no complaints. Being able to plug in my headphones or mp3 player directly to them is a huge plus."
3,OK with a Noise,"After two days use, I begin to notice a small high pitch noise from the speakers when it's idle. I even disconnected it from the PC, and the noise is still there, so it's not from the PC.I don't bother to return it. I just turned them off when not in use."
4,Great Speakers,"These are great, they have top and bottom end and they work great for me. The only think I'd change is the power cable, it's really stiff."
4,adequate speakers but tone dial not much useful,"I had recently purchased a new Dell Inspiron 620 computer and my then current speakers were not doing the job. Received these speakers a few days ago. I am satisfied that these speakers are an improvement from the built in monitor speakers and my previous set, which did not have a volume button. Because I will be using these on my desk, close to my computer, I probably will not be increasing the volume beyond the 9 to 11 o'clock position on the dial. Although I have not cranked the volume up, I am sure that they could get plenty loud if I did but I have no reason to for the purpose that I use them for. The tone dial needs an improvement. I didn't notice much difference in tone from treble to bass."
4,computer speaker,"Been looking for quite awhile to replace ""old"" speakers that I got with my first Dell computer system at least 15 years ago. Easy hook up and decent sound. Also like the volume and tone controls on front of right speaker."
2,Essentially unusable with my computer - unshielded power cord picks up radio signals,"The title of this review pretty much says all I have to say about the item. The unshielded power cord picks up radio signals and makes the speakers essentially unusable with my computer. That's a pretty big failing for speakers that are supposedly designed for that purpose.I strongly recommend against buying these for use with a computer.On the plus side, they are solidly constructed and attractive. I only wish they worked."
2,You get what you pay for,"I currently have a $30 pair of Altec Lansing computer speakers that are about the same style and size. I bought these for a second office b/c they looked cool and maybe they'd be my main speakers. But after listening to them - no way. They sound small, tinny and scratchy compared with the $30 Altec Lansings. They are cheap and that's what they sound like, please don't expect more."
2,Unlucky....,"I've owned a set of these speakers before, and I was very happy with them, worked as they should and I was quite happy with them, therefore I considered buying a second set for my new desktop, but unfortunately the set that I got ended up failing and I was unable to turn them on again after the speakers themselves started emitting strong static noise when I plugged them in, and then suddenly after 20 or so seconds just shut-down. I was just unlucky this time unfortunately..."
2,Very poor sound for their size.,"After reading a lot of reviews looking for ""slightly above average"" desktop speakers, I settled on these. They seemed a good fit for the price point and quality. I have the Audiophile M-40s at home which sound amazing, but these were just for work to listen to the occasional video clip or plug in my MP3 player.These are very large speakers, but don't put out a lot of sound. When I do turn them up to a decent volume, they get almost ""muffled"" and slightly distorted. They have a separate ""Tone"" button which I don't like at all. I can not find a sweet spot, and I think it is unnecessary to include this button. The instructions don't even really explain it, just saying to turn it until you get the sound you like. If anything, a simple ""Bass Boost"" button like most other speakers would suffice.They are not bad enough to return, but enough so that I would not recommend them unless they dropped to about $15"
5,Very Great 2.0 Speakers that Produce Excellent Sound!,"These speakers produce excellent sound. If your not into surround sound systems and just want something small, these are awesome. They also have 2 jacks: 1 to plug in your headphones, and 1 to plug in an external source - like an MP3 player, TV, CD player, etc. They even have a Tone nob to control Bass instead of a clunky Sub-Woofer. I bought these to replace some old and dying 6+ yr. old speakers and they do the job better."
1,No bass at all.,"I don't have ""golden ears"", so I can't guess where the low-frequency output cuts off, but it's a surprisingly high floor.For comparison: I own Logitech Z-5 speakers with just the juice they can pull off a USB 2 port--very little--and of course whatever's left over after the onboard USB audio takes its cut. The Z-5s cost about two and a half times as much (on sale), but they produce real bass, even down into inaudible frequencies, and have a pretty reasonable range for speakers with only two drivers each.These speakers should be able to produce at least a little bass output, but after buying, and returning, two pair, I can say that running off wall power doesn't help the X-140s at all in that department. Twisting the ""tone"" knob all the way right just makes the output muddy.I'd strongly recommend buying... almost anything else."
4,"Built Solid, Very good sound quality","For the money these are a very good bargain. Solid construction, great sound quality, very easy to install. I am extremely pleased with this product."
4,Very Good Sound and Value. A Solid Choice,"I have a good ear for sound, I used to be a DJ. These speakers do a fine job considering it's just a pair of conmputer stereo speakers without surround sound or extra bass.Pros: Solid sound performance and pricing. Plenty loud enough. Delivery was fast, setup was easy. Headphone jack as wellCons: Only a Tone adjustment, I'd like to see seperate bass and treble knobs to tweek the sound a bit"
2,One side no longer works,"I received these speakers for Christmas & have used them a handful of times. Today, I tried to play something and only one side plays music. The other side cuts in and out. The issue is with the wire connecting the two speakers, I can wiggle it and the sounds goes in and out. Pretty disappointed, it looks like it's been too long to return to Amazon."
1,Beware - photos can not be downloaded to Vista,"My son bought this item from Amazon. There is no where in the Amazon description that indicates that the software will only work on Microsoft XP and earlier editions. Our computer has Windows Vista, which means there is no way to view the photographs, so now we have to deal with the return process, and will probably lose our shipping costs. Don't buy this item if you have a MAC, or a PC with the Vista operating system."
3,Spy camera,"The software is a little clunky and the photos take a while to load, but a great gift for the price!"
3,Spy Camera,"Ordered one for my 6 year old and another for my 4 year old, they love it,so I guess its great."
2,Bad Editing,"I bought this CD expecting to hear full length versions of the original music that make up the collection. Since I am very familiar with several of the songs on the CD, I was dissapointed by the unprofessional editing that was done to these fine songs. Entire guitar solos or other sections are abruptly cut out so that the songs loose their natural progression and rythym. I have been listening to Juju music all my life and the way this CD has been unprofessionally edited to fit under 4 minutes per song is a diservice to the artist and his music.I have provided a two-star rating out of respect for the artist, otherwise this was a waste of money worth no star. This CD should be pulled from the shelves."
3,"Good, but disappointing","I suppose my rating of three stars isn't really fair, since this is essentially a good album of JuJu. But I was disappointed, because the packaging made me expect an album of earlier JuJu music, and instead it's a collection of material from the early 80's. And it does have that bright 80's sound, which I was hoping to avoid."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"An American corporate satire, mostly. Fairly well executed.A younger lawyer, without all the right collections, is struggling to make enough to eat.Some former well connected people, with a lot of knowledge and a right to wrong come to him for help.To do this, they have to involve a man with no memory, a broken down corporate wizard and some others in a plot to bring some justice to town."
4,Hidden History,"It's fascinating when one comes across history that is not often told, or is ignored. This thouroughly depressing book manages to cover the scope, immense timespan and breadth of the arab slave trade around the world in antiquity. It also doesn't shirk from dealing with the uncomfortable truths of the involvement of Africans in trading each other, or the religious basis for the slave trade as conducted by the arabs. The opening chapter adequately tackles the reasons the world doesn't seem to want to tackle the injustice of more than a thousand years of arabs trading black slaves.As someone who has family from the slave catchment areas in East Africa, it was interesting to read the accounts and reports of the events my grandfather would describe in his tales.A thoroughly good read... and a much needed education for all those who thought the european trans-atlantic slave trade was the worst there ever was."
5,Excellent Gift Idea,"I bought this as a gift. It looks exactly like the photo. I was very pleased with it. Only thing is, it comes with a divider and this means it can't accomodate some of the longer cigars. But the accessories are beautiful, and the lighter is gased so you can use it right away."
5,AN EXCEPTIONAL EXAMPLE OF 60'S SURF & ROD MUSIC,WHAT A GREAT ALBUM. IT IS FULL OF FUN SONGS FROM A WONDERFUL TIME. IT SURE BRINGS BACK SOME GREAT MEMORIES.
1,Not happy,I was not happy that the product was not available to buy and was told about it several days later. Had to e-mail several times to get my money back and was not credited to my credit card but sent through the mail. I was not pleased at all with the service.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I purchased this based on other reviews. It has a soft floral smell not too strong which is nice, but I am not pleased with this purchase for these reasons: First of all, it was not in the pink box as shown in the picture, but in some weird hard plastic shell. Second, the smell watters down quickly. But I guess you get what you pay for. Received it fast though."
1,Stale new age plot with poorly developed characters,"I agree with previous reviewer that the author does little to develop the characters, they are totally unrealistic and impossible to identify with. The author does a poor job with the subject matter. His foorays into mathematics are totally inaccurate. I got a chuckle out of his proof that infinity is greater than infinity. The new age kaballa theme is pretty stale and this book doesn't do a thing to freshen it up any. I really struggled to read the whole thing hoping it would get better. I purchased this book based on a recommendation from BLUE magazine. I guess they liked it because it involved travel and some sports, I can't see any other reason."
2,Too hip,"This book was a disappointment. The author seems to have pared down every line in some sort of quest for trendy minimalism. The content and interest in the scenes and dialogs are gone with this paring however. Kotler can evoke a locale at times with real style and grace, but too often you're left wanting a little bit more. All the characters act and sound as if they were at some prototypical silicon-valley milk bar, in their retro-hip fashions, hoping like hell to fit in with the coolist people there.Padre Isoceles's religious experience is the only truly hilarious scene for me in this book. A flash of brillance not equaled in the rest of the book."
2,A Hopeless Muddle,"While the story had some intriguingly trippy elements, it was probably the worst job of editing I've ever seen in a commercially produced book, with dozens of distracting typos, misspellings and grammatical errors. Worse was the meandering narrative that I kept reading in vain hope of finding some meaning."
1,A Total Mess,"I am a reader who appreciates nuance and complexity in a novel, but this book was an abomination. It was barely coherent, poorly dialoged, sloppily written, and intellectually frustrating. I read the entire book with the feeble hope of some satisfactory conclusion and was finally given one last disappointment for my trouble. As with most things, it all depends on your taste, but at least this review might give you some warning."
2,Does not provide enough leverage,The location of the 3rd wheel needs to be closer to the end of the base. Where it is does not properly balance the saw with extension. The wheel does not turn freely & I have to set it down an manually turn the wheel when I need to change from pushing to pulling the saw (which happens a lot with two fixed wheels). The center wheel is also a cheep hard caster that scratches my floor finish when turning.
2,Tons of typos!!!,"The book itself at this price is such insane! I have learned three chapters so far and have seen many many uncountable typos. Hence I have to write this review to tell other people the fact. Most of the typos are obvious and easy to spot. This book is not appropriate for self-learning, though the examples in the book is not hard to understand. The typos might mislead you."
2,reasonable competition for Taylor & Karlin,"Lots of typos.... The blurb on the Springer site is misleading: ""this book presents recent results previously available only in specialized monographs."" I have not seen anything in this book that is not in Taylor and Karlin or Lawlor's books. It's not bad mind you, just not as ""leading edge"" as the blurb says. If you're looking for that, try Bremaud's new ""Markov Chains"""
1,Welcome to a Confusing math book,"A math book should be concise, clear and exact. This book is concise, unclear. It is rare to see a complete sentence for definitions or propositions. The definitions for terminology and notation are scattered through the book. This structure was perhaps deliberately planned, but it confuses readers deliberately too."
3,Typos,"Rick Durrett has a very nice and intuitive approach, but unfortunately this book is full of typos."
4,lovely photographs,"very emotional, with beautiful family pictures, and moving short descriptions of characters, scenes of everyday life.the situation is all very sad, beginning with the funeral of the mother.it's not a novel or short story... just memories, without much linearity.some pages are hard to read: plain cruelty of the world.but I loved it."
1,This is the sorriest book I've ever read,"Dorothy Allison was raped, beat, yes she was indeed, along with thousand of other poor women. At least not all of them write such boring and self-pitying books. This book is more a manifesto for lesbianism than it is a ""memoir."""
5,Amazing,This book may be small but it packs a huge punch. Beautifully written it will bring tears to your eyes.
4,Moving mini-memoir,"Done originally as a theater piece, ""Two Or Three Things I Know For Sure"" is moving, a quick read, and educational. In other words, it's everything you'd expect from one of our finest contemporary writers. I didn't see it when it was performed as a show. As a memoir, it is very good. My only criticism is -- and it is not so much as a criticism as a wish -- that I wanted to know more, especially about Allison's Aunt Dot and her mother. The book is generously illustrated with photographs of Allison and her family through the years. There is a piece in the book family photographs in a box, pictures of relatives Allison knew little, if anything, about. I would have loved if that section were expanded upon, and maybe to have seen some of the photos. Succinct and thought-provoking (not to mention heart-tugging), this short book makes for a valuable reading experience."
1,Buyer Beware,"First, let me say from an economical standpoint, I just paid $11.90 for a 94 page book about almost nothing. Enchanted by Allison's Bastard Out of Carolina, I was looking forward to reading a memoir that I thought would most certainly illuminate the connection between life and art.Instead, Allison is unable or unwilling to tell any stories. She hints and dances around the characters of her life creating frustration and disappointment with almost every page.Yes, the writing is lyrical. Yes, there are a few moments when Allison's reflections on life hit the mark--just not often enough to justify the rest of the book.Most disappointing purchase I've made in a long, long time."
4,Poignant and proud,A biographical essay about how Allison used stories to voercome. A good read for readers who have found power in her stories.
4,Two or Three Things I Know for Sure,"This book was enjoyable to read even though it was assigned work. It has a mysterious tone and a level of depth that might escape less involved readers. Allison tells the classic story of a person trying to ""find themself"", but avoids making any concrete conclusions. Some of the photographs bring life to the book and others confuse the reader because they are not parallel with the text. Read it and you might realize that in the great search to find yourself you may come up empty-handed."
2,The Pattern didn't deliver,"I read this book after seeing Alfred Hitchcock's film version of it. After seeing the movie, I was quite inspired to read the book. Wow, was I ever wrong. The book had no suspense at all persay the predictable encounters between Eddie Shoebridge and Madam Blanche. The addition of the FBI men and the detective work that they do is a wonderful addition to this slightly dull book. The ending is the only reason that I gave this book two stars instead of one. All I can say is that if you do read Victor Canning (I don't) then go ahead and read this book."
2,Better than a phrase book...,"This course is certainly better than a phrase book. I like the dialogs and that they teach you the grammar.However, they use their own way of transliterating Thai into the roman alphabet, which makes it utterly confusing when you try to look something up in a dictionary. ""j"" is written as ""ch"", ""ch"" is ""sh"", etc.Furthermore, the transliteration is skimping on the tone marks. Tone marks appear in the glossary but not in the dialoges. Although each chapter has a section where they teach you Thai script, they don't show the Thai spelling of the words that are used in the dialoges.In my opinion, ""Teach yourself Thai"" is a better course than this one."
3,"This book is ok, better for buisiness traveler than pleasure","I went traveling in Thailand and wanted to prepare by learning a little Thai.This book was ok, but could have been much more useful if:1) The dialogue excercises and examples had been more geared towards typical traveler conversation. Instead, the first dialogues present ""in the office"" conversations.2) The roman letter pronunciation system followed a more standardized model. I found the system that this book uses to be far different from other pronunciation systems, and hence very confusing.On the good side, the flow of the book and the CD match up pretty well, and the book has lessons in Thai script, though I wished that it showed the differnt fonts, or all the different ways of writing the same Thai letter. In Thailand, I was not able to recognize many letters that I thought I had learned, because they did not match the examples in the book."
4,Buying the book with the CD is essential,"I recently joined a company that has allowed me the luxury to travel and work in Thailand from time to time. I have observed that there are several errors throughout the book, but generally it is very well written by its British and Thai authors. The book has an easy layout, and each chapter builds upon the next. I would strongly advise that the CD, (or the cassette), is purchased with the book, because it's impossible to duplicate the tones of Thai language from the text alone. As an ex-schoolteacher I appreciated what the authors were trying to acheive with this language course; learning the language in a systematic 'learning-by-doing' method. However, it's definitely not the type of book to carry around with you as a tourist in Thailand, so I would suggest the excellent Lonely Planet's Thai phrasebook for that. (ISBN 0-86442-658-5) Nick D. Benson, Boulder, CO, 12/2000"
4,Best for expats and business travel,"As a long-term resident of Thailand I found this book to be the best intoduction to Thai for other expats and for business travel in Thailand. The conversation exercises are practical and easy to apply in everyday speech. I particuarly like the way new words are presented: some are quite challenging for a new speaker but really essential to quickly coming to grasp with real Thai. Ironically, some of the words and phrases normally associated with language books (for example, shopping and tourist related activities) are not dealt with until much later in the book. Exercises in Thai script are a bit sketchy and, for a proper understanding, students will need a more advanced book on writing/reading Thai. Cassette tapes clear."
1,Excrutiating,"Joseph Jacobs was an interesting character; an Australian Jew who made his way to England and took up his interest in folklore, he wrote a collection of Celtic fairy tales that are now considered canonical. Even so, I considered this a pretty painful book to read. Much of it is written in an obnoxious style that wants to preserve some of the original Celtic sound but comes out being simply a chore to read. There's too much detail without enough substance, and the stories often seem to have little substance and little in the sense of wonder."
4,Cute little book.,"Tiny book (About the length & width of an index card.)But nice value. Surprisingly easy to read at this size, nice quality & illustrations."
2,Fairy tales,not sure what I expected but this is not it. should have explanation of origin so non Celtics understand tales
3,Celtic Fairy Tales,"I bought this mostly to understand the thought form of the ancient Celtics. As a window into their spiritual thoughts, this helped considerably."
4,a bit thinner than I expected,"not a deep winter hat but functional for mild temps above 0F ---- its a bit thinner than I expected and stays stretched after a few uses. but because its thin, it folds up nicely to fit in my pocket."
3,"Not a ""Long"" Beannie Hat","The picture shows the hat folded up with a cuff, suggesting that one could wear it just like that, thus providing a double layer of material to cover the ears.However, the hat is actually short and barely covers my ears when it is unrolled. After stretching it as much as possible to cover my ears, the cap tends to ride up again when I move around, leaving half of my ears exposed when the material shrinks back to ""normal"".Otherwise, the material is soft and lightweight, great for the mild winters here in Southern California. If the hat was a few inches longer, it would have been perfect. I bought two because the price was so low, probably because they are Made in China per the label inside the hats.This hat would probably be better for a child with a small head. I would consider buying two more if these were the longer version that I could wear rolled up to fit over my ears completely."
3,Good beanie,Just a beanie and keeps you warm. Not really a fashion type. More practical than anything. What can i say great product if your looking to keep your head warm
4,um..,"I like the hat but when I received the package, the hat was soaking wet which was kind of gross because I don't know why it was wet or for how long it had been wet"
1,not what i expected,"I thought this beanie would be slouchy due to its longness.I was wrong. its extremely stiff, even after washes.and it sticks straight up, like a gangmemeber would wear a beanie.i didn't really like the fabric, it was itchy."
5,GREAT DOUBLE FEATURE!!!!!,Got this for Indian Paint to see Johnny Crawford and Jay Silverheels. The print looks absolutely great in widescreen. African Safari was more interesting than I thought it would be. That print was also great and was in a full-screen version.
2,Unable to view the VHS.,"Although the indicator stated Used/Good, there is no picture available. To say ""I don't like it"" isn't true because I can't view it. I would like to return it for a full refund."
3,Indian Paint,The audio is not in sync with the video; this detracts from this video. Are all copies like this or did I purchase a bad one? I purchased through Amazon from an independent supplier.
5,FILMED LOCATION,I HAVE READ THAT THIS WAS FILMED IN GRAND PRAIRIE TX BUT I KNOW FOR A FACT IT WAS FILMED IN FISHERMANS PARADISE IN RIO VISTA TX OR AT LEAST THE MAJORITY OF IT WAS
1,i did not like it,i think the video was terriable! i couldn't believe that anyone would even put a video out that was that bad. if i were you i would be shamed.
2,One serious drawback in #3 and #4,"The one serious drawback in these recordings of Symphonies 3 and 4 is that the kettledrums are mostly inaudible. From having heard many performances of these works, I know how they should sound. I have to use my imagination when I should be hearing the kettledrums. It is essential that they be audible. (They are OK in #1 and 2.) So basically I cannot recommend this set."
4,My daughter is a true lover of Prima Princess,"We recently had the chance to watch this and my daughters fell in love with it. My youngest (7) could not take her eyes off the television. The movie is not really long but I think it is just enough time for your child to watch it, dance a little and have some fun."
5,rbg,"This book is a great inspiration for my granddaughter, who is beginning her ballet training at 7 years old. The book is well illustrated and great information."
4,"Lovely, but could be better.","I love the idea of these videos. I got the Swan Lake one for my girls last year and decided to get the Nutcracker since we were taking them to see the Nutcracker Ballet this past Christmas. I still love these videos but I must admit the production value is a bit low. The sound was really awful. It wasn't that bad on the Swan Lake DVD. And I think they should have a little more of kids doing real ballet moves rather so much of the cute little kids and animals making ""similar"" moves. Other than that, my girls love them and love to dance with them."
3,A disappointment compared to PP Swan Lake,"After watching PP Swan Lake, I was eager to buy this DVD. When it arrived, it's a big disappointment. The picture quality of the Acts on stage is not clear at all and it does not catch my daughter's attention. The ballet steps between the Acts are not as organized as Swan Lake, way too repetitive and lack of real content. Ballet lessons in Extras are not as good either. Also the quality of the disk is lousy too, it kept skipping so I had to stop it. Love the concept but overall this DVD is a huge disappointment. Hope this review will help the producers improve their future DVD quality."
5,Get Your Daughter's Tutu Ready,"Become a ballerina! Prima Princessa brings you England's world famous Birmingham Royal Ballet performing excerpts from The Nutcracker that will inspire the ballerina in you!NCircle invites you to join in the holiday fun with Prima Princessa as she takes you to a magical show filled with snow fairies, toy soldiers, tutus, pirouettes and plies.We watched The Nutcracker today on the way to the mall. Little girls are going to love this one, it is interactive and teaches a few simple dance moves which will make them feel like real ballerinas. It also shows enough excerpts from the show that girls are able to follow the story line easily. If you have a little girl and think this DVD is for you, be sure to have a tutu ready because you are going to need it!"
4,Prima Princessa Presents The Nutcracker DVD Review,This is just perfect for Christmas. We loved Prima Princessa Presents The Nutcracker and so did my 3 year old daughter. she tried to mimic many of the moves. She loved the whole show. What girl doesn't love ballet. She even had us replay it for her. She eve went as far as to make me put her tutu on her so she could dance with the DVD. I loved how much fun my little girl had with this DVD.
2,they sold out,on search in america was so much better. this album was a real dissapointment for me. they're alot poppier now.
3,Cutsie melodrama,"Yes, Shirley Temple is unbelievably cute. And her one dance with Buddy Epson is amusing. But the rest of the film is treacle, based on a highly predictable and melodramatic story designed to exploit the emotions of the masses. The colorized version, by the way, is terrible; one of the worst I've seen. What a way to kill an hour and a half."
4,Verry good movie,"I love this story and Shirley Temple. It is very sweet and I love the location. It is very stylized with the truant officer being much worse that could possibly be, but it works."
5,LA in the Southeast US,"A well written, concise introduction to modernist landscape architecture with two mentions of the currently being rediscovered, and as of the moment one of the uncelebrated leaders of landscape architecture in the Southeast, Lewis Clarke. Book arrived as promised by seller."
5,Great Writing ... Great Authors,"My husband and I just finished reading 'Before Memories Fade' and thoroughly enjoyed the stories ... some very sad but all especially appreciated ... Each author shared some very special memories of war experiences ... One especially enjoyable read was 'Short Timer' by Alan Fuchs. The little puppy found Alan and helped him through the battle ... sad that he had to be left behind upon Alan's return to the states. Each memory shared by the various authors is very personal and special ... Thanks to Lt. Col. Robert W. Michel, U.S. Army Retired for putting it all together ... We need to remember the sacrifices made by so many men and women and those sacrifices are still ongoing. Again, Thank You!"
2,False advertisment,"The picture that is presented for this Delta Saw Blade Guard product is NOT what you will receive. The electronics you see on the armature are NOT included in the order. There is nothing ""Duluxe"" about this product and is NOT the great deal Delta advertises. Though the guard works fine I was not satisfied with the amount I paid for this. Buyer Beware."
5,a reader,"Those of you who will read this, I just want to let you know that the new book called Desperado by Rebecca B. is the same as this one. It is a wonderful story of a woman with untold strengh. She leaves her home of New York to come to Texas and live with her senile old grandfather, where she meets her grandfather's godson Judd whose parents may have been married, but he was just a bastard. She also meets Judd's and Gramp's enemy, Rigo. Rigo is kind of the answer to Araminta's prayers. I say that because he kind of rescues her from Judd, but the reason he did it is not so noble. He is a little too commanding for my tastes, but he is perfect for her."
2,very very slow,had to wait forever for mr rigo to finally make his move the end of the book not for me yawn
2,An Almost Good Film,"""Higher Learning"" has solid performances, a great premise, and is directed by a filmmaker with potential, John Singleton. So why didn't I like it? For one, the material is so busy and tries to juggle too much. We're introduced to themes of sexual assault, racism, conformity, sexual identity, and blah, blah, blah. A film this preachy is best viewed on a monitor sitting on a pulpit. Second of all, it's not the envelope-pushing commentary it thinks it is. In addressing various issues (sexual identity and racism in particular) Singleton creates very obvious targets and resorts to cliched, one-dimensional characters. The cast (Laurence Fishburne, Omar Epps, Tyra Banks, Michael Rappaport, and Jennifer Connelly) is the best thing here, and they do what they can with the flawed material they have to work with. In my school of cinema, ""Higher Learning"" gets a grade of C."
5,Great Movie,I dont know what everyone is talking about with race wars or whatever....but i love the movie...one of my favorites!
5,A Very Enlightening Movie,I think this movie was outstanding....Not only does John Singleton show you the ignorance of racism on the parts of both blacks and whites but he went even further as to address the insecurities of women and sexuality and the need to be accepted by your peers....this movie gets two thumbs up....I wish more people could understand his message and pass it on....We all think we are different but this movie proves we're all the same.
1,A movie that is symbolic of black ignorance,This movie is a great piece of propaganda. It has very little substance and the plot is transparent and shows the ignorance of John Singleton. Basically the movie displays blacks as wonderful and whites as evil. The movie is your typical hollywood hate propaganda against whites. John singleton lost all credibility with this movie.
2,Too Scattered,"This movie has grand aspirations, but has no focus. Singleton is trying to tell too many stories at once, doesn't go into depth on any of them, and then dumps them all at the end for a silly skinhead attack. The stars all do a fine job in the movie, I blame Singleton for this disaster. I would recommend watching it solely to see how a movie that could have been good can go so wrong. Or just do yourself a favor and get ""Training Day""."
1,Did Singleton Even Go To College?,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie portrays white supremicists as being some sort of norm, equal to any group of afrocentric college students. And the heavy-handed Christopher Columbus message is too much. If you want to see a movie on kids and race relations, rent ""American History X."" I loved ""Boyz in the Hood"" but between this and ""Poetic Justice""(aweful), Singleton has been a huge bust. Spare yourself the frustration. This is the first bad review I have ever written."
2,"Good premise, lousy execution",Welcome to Columbus University. Where students are divided among racial lines. Where security regularly harasses black students. Where neo-nazis and the black panthers go to recruit new members. Where interracial and homosexual couples have to fear being attacked. Where campus shootings are bound to happen.A movie about reace relations in college was a great idea and there are good performances from the leads in the film. The movie made some great points about students needing to appreciate the opportunities college brings them and taking responsibility for their own lives. However it also puts the characters at such extremes that it makes a totally unrealistic portrayal of college life. If this is what the writer went through in college than the university should be ashamed.
2,Good Concept Horrible Execution,There are great lesson in this movie but they are overshadowed by the cartoonish stereotypes used to try and lead the viewer by the hand through all of the mental obstacles. The movie never lets you think about anything because it all so heavy handed and blatent.
5,Higher Learning was a great movie,"I think this movie was great, it is definitely one of my favorites. I think all the characters work well together and it brought to light a lot of issues that are still going on today. It also had a lot of positive messages in it. I would highly recomend watching it if you have not already."
3,3 stars for entertaining me,"Jennifer Connelly plays a lesbian, Kristi Swanson plays a sexually confused college student, Ice Cube & Busta Rhymes play black power militants, Michael Rapaport plays a confused nerdy college student who gets wooed by Nazi Skinheads, Tyra Banks plays a brainy track star (as does Omar Epps without the brainy-ness), the guy from ""Dazed & Confused"" plays the leader of a gang of Nazi skins that number about 4 members, Laurence Fishburne plays a know-it-all professer...the end."
5,Great movie!,"I love Higher Learning because it makes you think and it shows you the concequences of being racist. Higher Learning is a film that is not to be missed. Its about three students that come to Columbus University and well, they get a tast of the real world. Buy this movie. It had great preformences from Fishburn, Epps, Connely,Rapaport and Cude."
5,GREAT MOVIE,I CAN WATCH IT REPEATEDLY. IT SHOWED THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING AN EDUCATION. IT SHOWED HOW RACISM AFFECTED THOSE FOLKS IN THAT TIME PERIOD. TYRA BANKS WAS IN THE MOVIE.
3,Not very realistic...,"I must say that ""Higher Learning"" is a pretty decent movie and it is one that I don't mind seeing every once in a while, but, the way the university is portrayed is hideously unreal. Could a school really have that many issues? I think not. The film is worth seeing, I believe, but the situations in it should never be taken as [realistic] possiblilities. I haven't seen this movie in a very long time, but from what I can remember, it really was disturbingly unreal. It's not a horrible film, but it's no masterpiece."
3,Higher Learning....A Disappointment or Educational Message?,"Ok, so we got the picture, racism, rape, homosexuality, basically ignorance in society. However, some of the issues were either too cliche' or should have been edited out. The lesbian relationship or lack thereof was way too A-B-C, the rape was obviously not emotionally constructed in certain points and then too emotionally constructed in others, the racial controversy was the same way. At a certain point in the movie which just seems to bounce from storyline to storyline; you just want to close your eyes and wish the credits were rolling...Sorry John but this one is one in which just didn't go in depth as I thought it would. There should have been more passion in this movie and I just didn't feel it..."
1,Doesn't quite make the mark,"John Singleton is the most predictable director in the history of movie-making. He has a one track mind in his story lines. In every single movie he 's directed the love scenes are all identical. ""Boys in the Hood"" wasn't nearly as good as ""Menace II Society."" ""Higher Learning"" was no ""Mississippi Burning."" Learn from these great films, please! I think Singleton can do better and I hope he does someday."
2,Question?,"What I want to ask is why black film makers make films that are racially charged? Granted Higher Learning is a good film but it could have been so much more. For my money Ice Cube is the only rapper who has made a decent transition to acting and he is quite good in this but please, does singleton have to put Busta Rhymes in this movie because there is no point to his character, all he does pepper ever sentence with the word 'white boy'. I may be wrong but I think poor Busta has been used as a marketing tool to sell this movie.If you believe what you see on the silver screen then america has some serious race problems...granted uk has a few race problems of its own, but it is nothing compared to the states. Higher learning is not singletons best film...in fact he only made one good movie [boyz 'n' the hood]...i hate to drone on but this is my first review..."
4,another Singleton powerhouse,"though it deals with a lot of racism and depicting Nazi's in here, it deals a good job with problems that people have. Epps does a great job in the title role and Michael Rapaport is really evil and he is also the one who kills Tyra Banks at the end which is one of the most powerfulest scenes in that movie and Epps watches her die and then he runs to go find Rapaport. Fishburne as the Professor is again always good in roles. Ice Cube also does a good job as well. other actors like Kristy Swanson and Jennifer Connelly appear as well."
3,The Extreme College Life,"This movie reminded me of my college days, when I had a rotten roommate for most of my first year. (That convinced me to change schools!) Although he ended up killing two people, I sympathized with Michael Rapaport's character Remy because he originally wanted to get away from Idaho and study to become an engineer. Unfortunately, he fell in with the wrong crowd.I thought Ice Cube's character was too hard on Remy, although I liked it when he charged into the frat house to grab Billy, the guy who raped Kristen and called Monet a racial epithet. What I didn't understand was how the Neo-Nazis could remain on campus after they beat up a black student for dating a white student, and plotting the rampage at the multicultural fest."
3,I feel that my review is honest.,"The movie ""Higher Learning"" is very relevant to this day and age. Granted the movie does have a lot of mini-storylines that don't get its complete attention, I felt that the main issue was racism. Therefore, the main issue that should have been addressed was the situation with Remie and its repercussions. I think the movie brought out things that the black community at various colleges face."
3,Typical Tribute Mixed Bag,"There's a fundamental problem with tribute albums - big fans of the original band won't like them (""they've ruined the songs!"") and fans of the covering bands tend not to listen to much else but their favorite band's one track. That said, TE has compiled an impressive and varied group to take a stab at XTC's oeuvre. Highlights include: Sarah McLachlan's haunting remake of ""Dear God"", the Rembrandts' straight ""Making Plans for Nigel"", Ruben Blades recasting of ""The Man Who Sailed Around His Soul"", Crash Test Dummies' odd reworking of ""All You Pretty Girls"" and They Might Be Giants' typically odd ""25 O'Clock"". Only Spacehog's glam ""Senses Working Overtime"" doesn't quite work. Oddly, Joe Jackson's ""Statue of Liberty"", which should be a match made in heaven, is simply good. XTC fans, approach with an open mind...and be pleasantly rewarded."
5,better than expected!,"I put these on my wedding registry, sight-unseen, and wow, they are beautiful! The colors are lively and cheerful and match almost anything we cook. Our old dinner plates look so drab by comparison we got rid of them. We got most of the Twist Alea set -- plates, bowls, platters and they all match very well. Quality is quite high, microwaveable."
3,Buy this just for the last track!,I don't really care for Caravan. I have just two caravan albums-Land of pink of grey and this one. But this album is worth the money b/c of the last track (long epic). It's not 'starless' by King crimson but it just flows nice and smoothly. Excellent track. I can compare this track to 'Metamorphosis' by Curved air. Nice melody and cool keyboard sound. This is one of those rare recordings I strongly recommend based on only a couple of songs (Video of Hollywood is also good) on a CD. Get it!
2,Simply bad,"I loved Tom Schroeppel's great ""The Bare Bones Camera Course for Film and Video,"" so I expected to love this book as well. I got it in the mail the other day and sat down and then read the whole book through. Let me tell you, this book is bad. From the very begining of the book I could tell and it lasted the whole way through, hardly any useful information at all. This is the worst book on creating film or video that I have read yet. I respect the author for his good work on his previous book, but lets face it; this book is awful. It seems as if the author is very good at explaining technical things simply, as he does in his previous book. But his attempt to explain the creation of a film is horrible."
2,Great Mouse Surface...Horrible Metal Finish,"This is one of the better mouse surfaces I've used, which makes it hard for me to give it such a bad review. On the plus side, it has a nice weight to it, and won't slide around on you. Also, the mousing surface is excellent. On the negative, the finish on the metal parts is awful. After a month of use, the coating on the metal started to rub off where my wrist rests. This was exasperated by customer service that failed to reply to my email."
1,Mousepad doesn't work with my optical mouse.,"The mousepad looks nice and sleek. Alas, it doesn't work with my USB wired optical mouse. The surface of this mousepad is too dark for the mouse to work properly. I contacted Allsop asking for guidance and they didn't respond.Needless to say, I returned this mouse pad."
4,fast!,Fast an smooth. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!! ! !! !!! !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!
2,Don't expect much for gaming,"As a very avid gamer, I picked this up at my local Micro Center because it was seemingly the best they had. If you, like I, use a laser mouse, do NOT buy this pad. It skips horrifically, and has almost no resistance whatsoever (I realize the latter issue is more of a personal preference than a design flaw, but it is, to me, an issue). I tested the surface with 3 different laser mice, all reacting the same. I haven't attempted using this with an optical or ball (do they even exist anymore?) mouse, but like I said, it is absolutely awful for a laser mouse."
1,Allsop Mouse Pad A Dissapointment,"I bought one of these several years ago at a local retailer. It was the last one they had left. In hindsight I think I know why. For one thing I had hoped it would be the last mouse pad I would ever need to buy. However I too have noticed the tarnish on the metal about where my wrist would set. But strangely, fine scratches all over the edges of the metal. I can't think of a reason for this.I think the attribute for this product should be ""Quality of Product"" - Not ""Ease of Use"". And due to the poor quality of this item I cannot give it any stars.I think my next mouse pad will be a homemade one from a piece of plexi-glass (pollycarb) and contact paper. I am tired of spending money on mouse pads that do not last."
4,Hard Mouse pad,Love this mouse pad. It lets me use my mouse on the sofa while watching TV. It has a metal base and the surface is not good for optical mouse. I used a cheap mouse pad on the surface and works great.
1,Does not work with (some?) wireless mice,"Warning, I have a Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 5000 and my mouse does not register the slightest movement or clicks when its near this pad. It seems like the metal of the mouse pad is inhibiting the wireless signal.Also mine had the top glued slightly off-center, which I find highly annoying."
3,Decent,"The foam backing is held on by a syrup consistency type glue, and the bottom left corner of mine is slightly discolored, but i would've beaten it up anyway so it is not a big deal. It is exactly what i was looking for because the metal backing keeps it solid even when used on my bed which is where i do the majority of my gaming. All in all the quality would be fine if it was handled or constructed better but if you aren't too worried about looks, the function is as good as you can get for the price."
2,"Great surface, crap finish","Grabbed this from a local retailer for its slick surface, which I loved using with quite a few optical and laser mice. A month into use, the cheap chrome finish flaked off onto my wrist exposing some copper-looking metal underneath. At least it was cheap..."
2,"Sturdy, metal finish wears off","Looks professional and refined, a weighty object with sleek surface surrounded by silver metal.Does not slip, because of matting underneath.Works well for fast-paced gaming with my optical mouse.I have used it for three months and have no problems with the finish.Edit:Now after four months, the metal finish has started to wear by the wrist, which looks quite dirty."
