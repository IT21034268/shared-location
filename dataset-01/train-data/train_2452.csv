4,slayer takes punk rock to new levels,"this is a very good cd but not great.these cover are definitly heavy and well done but I would have chosen some different bands to cover or thought slayer would have!Knowing Slayer you think of their punk roots you think dead kennendy's,circle jerks,exploited(which the covered on the judgment night soundtrack years ago)the damned,misfits,sex pistols,black flag, or even some hardcore, maybe.I presonally like slayer metal cover alot I might have done 2 cds punk and metal Ex.motorhead,judas priest ( been done,)venom( done live),black sabbath (been done),or iron maiden.the cd is good sellection of bands,sounds well and all around very aggressive typical slayer style- but punk."
1,dont buy,"when u open it, it looks and smells like dog food! i have not had the guts to taste it yet!"
4,Good vegan alternative to ground beef,"I use this in spaghetti sauce to give it texture. Good as a vegetarian alternative to ground beef. Very easy to crumble, though it's not dry. Decent taste, but I'd suggest using it as an ingredient rather than eating it on its own."
4,Pretty good. Gives boyfriend gas.,"I am a vegetarian, and my boyfriend is not. I really like this product, and love it mixed in with scrambled eggs for breakfast, or in veggie Chili. Sometimes I eat it right out of the can if I am feling particularly lazy. It doesn't stick very well to itself, so it doesn't make very good burgers IME, even with a ingredients added to help it stick. Back to my boyfriend, this product gave him MAD GAS, and intestinal upset. He is afraid to eat it and asks me if I used ""the canned burger stuff"" before trying anything I cook. It digests just fine for me."
5,Very sexy book,"I love the characters in this book and am recommended it to all my female friends, straight _and_ lesbian. Ruby is such a great earth-mother, sexy lesbian character, and I only wish I knew someone like that."
3,Evocative Literary Erotica,"These stories are original, beautifully crafted, and pleasurably erotic, but I found my interest waning as I moved through the collection. The concept of revisiting the characters in different stories creates an interesting resonance but also a redundancy of mood and narrative voice."
5,Fun in learning,"Buzz and Ollie's High, Low Adventure is a fresh, inventive way to teach children the musical concept of pitch while they go on a great adventure with their friends Buzz and Ollie. This book of a three book series has some great animals throughout the story. Mr. Worm and the baby birds were some of my favorites. My grandson sat still for this book (he is four and that's pretty amazing) in part because of the fun rhyming text but also for the vividly colorful illustrations. A great book for home or even a classroom settings."
1,one Major problem,"There is a lot to like about this handheld chess game. But, do not waste your money unless you plan on using it only in well lit places. The LCD is almost impossible to read (so much do that I've had to look for a different handheld chess unit). In this day and age, I don't think its asking too much to expect a better display. My recommendation is to wait for a better product. But its your decision."
1,Get the Saitek Cosmic instead,"This is not a bad little chess computer, it is just the interface that is its downfall. Everytime I wanted to quit a game a start a new one the game would cut off. The start and off areas are above each other. In addition, the manual is almost non-existant. The Saitek cosmic, even though a little more expensive is much better, although both models suffer from lack of a back light. The Saitek model uses a touch screen, but also uses menu keys and a message area at the bottom of the screen to make a much better package. It also uses standard chess notation when giving hints etc. The excalibur model just flashes pieces."
1,poor screen,"very poor visibilty....the Mephisto Maestro is a similar product with superb graphics! It runs about $79 or so, and is wonderful to carry with you....long waits at doctor appointments, etc. Great, great product."
5,Great for the price!,"There are better chess computers out there but for the price this one is pretty good. It has 73 levels of play, several games stored in its database that you can watch, and options to play another player on the machine, options to practice many different openings, and options to watch the machine play against itself. Its a great machine for the price and quite challenging for beginning and intermediate level players."
2,not one of my books,"I do not have this book, and do not remember ordering it. I would like to buy it,however, if one is available"
5,BE READY TO EXPECT JESUS FOR HE'S SURELY TO COME!,JOHN CHISUM CD COME EXPECTING JESUS WAS THE MOST SPIRTUAL INSPIRATIONAL PRAISE AND WORSHIP MUSIC I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME.EVERY SONG HAS A SPECIAL ANOINTING UPON IT. I COULD FEEL GOD'S PRESENCE STRONGLY!I WOULD SUGGEST YOU BUY ONE FOR YOURSELF AND BLESS THE OTHER TO A FRIEND OR SOMEONE WHO IS UNSAVED. THIS CD WILL CERTAINLY TOUCH THE HEARTS OF MANY CHRISTIANS AND SOON TO BE CHRISTIANS!AMEN!MARK_ELIZA
4,You still find it difficult to measure!,"This book is easy to read. There are no jargons or unfamiliar terms. The author gives many examples of how some corporations set metrics and measure them. However, unfortunately, you find in many cases that the author says ""this is difficult to measure"" or ""this is one of the most difficult to measure"". This book is a bit less useful than I expected."
2,Where's the beef?,"I am bought into the philosophy that the ability to effectively measure operational performance is key to achieving excellence. Unfortunately, this book provides little useful information. This is one of those 'advocacy supersedes real content' books."
4,Intense,INTENSE and I mean INTENSE. This book is riviting from the begining. Very well written and visually captivating. I don't usually read this genre of book and found it to be spell binding. Very good book.
2,Smells great but nothing special,"I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner because my salon is now using Bumble and Bumble products and my stylist was raving about the products. The coconut smell is great but the shampoo and conditioner are just ok. I thought that it would make my hair smooth and give it more shine, but my hair feels like I am using a cheap supermarket brand shampoo. Also, my forehead seems to be a little on the oily side since I started using these products. I normally have very dry skin with no blemishes. I am kinda disappointed because I spent $50 on both the shampoo and conditioner. I wouldn't buy these again..."
2,"its just ok, not worth the price","I have fine, wavy hair, and i bought this shampoo because i have read other good reviews about it. I was expecting more for the price. I wouldnt buy this product again. it made my hair feel like straw after. the next time i went to the salon, my hair lady asked "" what have you been using in your hair, it feels soo dry?! smells nice, but i could have used suave and got the same results. think i will try Wen haircare next time."
2,Shipped wrong product,"I ordered shampoo, and the merchant shipped conditioner. I even double-checked the order and packing slip - they just shipped wrong item. I'd be OK with that, but when I contacted them about fixing *their* error, they wanted me to ship the product back to them at *my* cost. I had just had a baby (which is why I was buying shampoo online to begin with), so loading a newborn in the car and going down to my post office so I could ship the wrong bottle back to them just wasn't going to happen. I ended up keeping the conditioner, and buying shampoo from a different merchant."
2,Doesn't lather well and left hair feeling dry.,"I feel like I need to use a lot of this product to get it to lather even a little bit. After one washing with it, I feel like my hair is still dirty. The other reviewers made it sound like it was more of a moisturizing shampoo, which is what I was looking for, and much to my disappointment, it doesn't seem to be. The one plus, it smells very nice. Just wish it performed better."
3,save your money,"It seemed just like a normal shampoo. There was nothing fantastic about it, expect for the smell. And the price for it is ridiculous, i spent 40 bucks on both the shampoo and conditioner, for those tiny little bottles, that are pretty much travel size. The price is not worth the quantity that you get for it."
1,Not the real Bumble & Bumble Creme De Coco,"I bought this product in August 2010 thinking it was salon people wanting you to pay more in a salon that gave it the bad reviews. It is not the same Bumble & Bumble you buy in a salon. It's watered down, dries your hair and you have to use twice as much as the original just to get some lather. DO NOT buy from this seller if you expect it to be the same as a previous Bumble & Bumble experience."
1,Be warned,"I had recently purchased this item at Amazon because my local retailer did not have any in stock. The items arrived quickly and in great shape. However, the coconut shampoo does not have the same smell or feel as the ones purchased at the salon. Could be just me but then again, I was warned about purchasing this type of item on line. All future purchases of this type of product will be from either the salon or a reputable retailer."
1,"FAKE, FAKE, FAKE!",I thought that I was imagining things when I first opened this and thought that it was watery and fake. I feel so much better now reading the reviews. DO NOT BUY!
1,Seller Cheating Consumer,"I saw the price went up at Target (where I normally buy this shampoo). I've been using the product for years and decided to check Amazon's price. I was happy to see that it was so much more inexpensive to purchase it online. When I received the product, I used it right away, but everyday I keep thinking about how it isn't the same product I've been using for years. It's diluted and watery. Usually the product lasts me MONTHS, this time it is almost done within a month. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER."
2,Bumble & Bumble Creme de Coco Shampoo Diluted?,"Although I purchased this shampoo in June, I just started using this particular bottle. I have been using Bumble and Bumble shampoo for years and have always been pleased with it, however this latest bottle seems to be diluted. It takes much more than normal to get a lather. Either the company has changed the product or the seller has done something to it. I read one other review from a buyer who had the same complaint. Has nobody else noticed anything different?Update: I wrote both Amazon and the seller about this problem. Amazon is refunding me. The seller admitted to getting a bad batch of the product. Why they continued to sell it, I don't know. Contact Amazon if you received this defective product."
5,Excellent shampoo,"I've used B & B products for years, including this shampoo. Though expensive, it lasts much longer than most shampoos, has a great lather, smells good, and makes my hair shiny. If you haven't used any of B & B products, buy this. You'll be pleased!"
3,Shampoo and Conditioner,"I have used B&B products in the past with ""ok"" results. Despite the price, I decided to try Creme De Cocoa because my hair tends to be dry, and it is wavy so when I dry it straight, I often get ""pouf"". I do not wash my hair every day, I also have highlights. The shampoo is concentrated so you don't need a lot, which was good because my hair is thick. It smells great. It just didn't seem to do anything spectacular to my hair to justify the price. It's ""ok"". I probably won't get it again though."
5,Love My Hair - Again!,"I've cut costs on haircare items these past few months in an effort to try to save money...and I don't care what they say - I certainly noticed a BIG difference in my hair. Manageability, shine, overall look...my hair never looked so bad. So I decided to treat myself and try Bumble and Bumble. WOW.This stuff is worth every penny. I'm in love with my hair...all over again.You get what you pay for, girls."
1,This is FAKE DO NOT ORDER!!,"Wow I wish I read the reviews before ordering this. I order so much through my prime account, I thought I could trust Amazon with some Bumble and Bumble (which I've used for over 10 years). This product is not Bumble and Bumble. It turns your head into a crazy ammount of suds when you use the shampoo. Then it leaves it dry and stringy. NOT Bumble and Bumble. Bumble should take a lawsuit out on Amazon over this. Amazon, you should be ashamed!!"
3,Not great,"I bought this because I'd always heard the brand was so good, but I haven't really noticed anything special about it. I would not buy it again, nor would I recommend it."
1,Bumble & Bumble Creme de Coco Shampoo,I have used this product before and loved it. It did not seem like the same product. It smelled like Suave instead of the rich coconut smell I usually associate with this product. It made my hair feel tangled and dry. Will buy the product from a retail store or directly from Bumble and Bumble in the future.
5,Tropical paradise in a bottle!,"I so love this shampoo! B&B's Creme de Coco shampoo adds umph to my super fine & color-treated hair, which is definitely less frizzy & softer after blow drying. I sometimes use a shine serum as part of my styling routine but haven't needed to since using this shampoo. Like most other B&B shampoos, a little goes a long way & the lather is incredible! Plus, it smells GREAT! The mild, pleasant coconut scent reminds me of the beach. For me, the price has proven to be well worth it & Amazon's price is the best I've found so far. Another fabulous product to try by B&B if you have hair like mine is their Thickening Spray."
2,I think the product has been watered down!!,"I have used Bumble and Bumble products for years, purchased from the salon. I needed more shampoo so decided to buy it on line-big mistake ! Whoever is selling this is thinning out the product and making it impossible to use unless you use half a bottle. It doesn't foam up like it should, this product should be very concentrated so a little goes a long way. For the price of this item, I will NEVER buy from Amazon via a seller (unknown) again. I'm sure Bumble and Bumble would not want their product marketed this way. Buyer beware!!!!!"
5,CoCo,"This was purchased for my sister who had a little poOdle by the name of CoCo Creme. My sister would always refer to her as BoO! So, in honor of CoCo Creme, I purchased this shampoo for my sister who was familiar with its great performance.I gave it to her as a 'Birthday' gift...only I call it CoCo Sham-BoO! Great product and Quick delivery! A great gift for anyone even if they don't have a PoOdle. A great dealer to deal with."
1,Big Disappointment!,"This CD is not only a big disappointment, it's a downright misrepresentation of a product. This is not the original album, from master tapes or any other sources. It's not even the short versions but, more like, shortened versions of the short versions. The CD lists the duration of each track to match the original album and, this is where the misrepresentation LIES. I've come to learn that it's a Hit or Miss proposition with Hot Productions. On the one hand, I've been more than pleased with some of their products but, on the other, some of their representations have bordered on the ""illegal"" end of advertising."
1,The Great Cheat!!,"This album is not from the original master tapes!The great ""Take A Chance"": a version of 3,04 minutes and not the original 7,50 minutes :-(The others tracks are only the short versions!!Don't buy this CD!!!"
2,Doesn't sound as good as original vinyl,"The only reason I got this CD is to get ""Take A Chance On Me"" in digital format. Though the CD says ""from the master tapes"", the sound quality is inferior to the vinyl version of the song (on Bobcat records). And, they could have easily included the instrumental version of this song on the CD as well."
2,Dull,"If you buy a ""Greatest Hits"" by Bobby Orlando or ""O"" Records, you should rightfully find ""Take A Chance On Me"" by Waterfront Home taking pride of place, as it's a top-notch Hi-NRG floor filler, very similar in pace to ""Danger"" by The Flirts. Sadly, it's the only good track on this album. All the rest are just filler, and none of them is anywhere near as good as the aforementioned classic. Plus some are saddled with a risably strained male vocal performance which just drags them down even lower.A couple of the tracks have the familiar Bobby O dance beat, such as ""Teenage Girl In Love"" and ""Dancing In Heaven"", but others, coming with titles like ""Hulkamania"" and ""Rockin-Reggae-Rhythm"" and are as awful as they sound. The remaining (non Hi-NRG) tracks seem built around ripping off ""IOU"" by Freeeze, most notably in the track called ""I L.O.V.E. U"" (oh, please...)This CD seems quite hard to find, but I wouldn't worry. Just look for ""Take A Chance on Me"" on one of the many, better Bobby O compilations"
4,An Educator's Recommendation,"This is an entertaining summer adventure theme. Great light reading for a summer program, this book could also be a good back to school discussion starter or writing prompt to freshen up the traditional ""What I Did On My Summer Vacation."" Young readers will be surprised to learn that Peggy Parish wrote about characters other than Amelia Bedelia."
5,The Little Rascals,My eight year old loves these tapes!! He laughs so hard and watches them over and over again. I would recommend this to anyone..His grandfather loves them too.
3,happy with it.,Could have had more of the Spanky Alphalfa series was disapointed there but over happy with it. Worthe the purchase
4,"One of his absolute best, four and 1/2 stars","Personally, I don't think that Al Kooper ever made a bad album, and this one is certainly among his best. It may not have the high points of I Stand Alone, but it doesn't have the low points either (Soft Landing On The Moon comes to Mind). I love Magic In My Socks, a great lead-off track. Al's horn charts are the best. This album also includes Al's 1st huge effort at a chart hit, the title track. It's most definitely a 'should have been' hit, but didn't make it, and Al never tried so hard at chart success again.The low points are several originals, Lucille and Blues, Pt. 4 (just a jam, really). But, as usual, Al's R&B; covers hit the mark, and the production of the album really shines, making even the mediocre material listenable. All in all a great listen, if you can find it. Personally, I was lucky enough to find a still sealed LP for not much money. I'm a happy camper."
5,Pivot Review,I loved Pivot. The ideas are simple but offer a tremendous impact. I have started applying them and it is making a difference in my attitude and outlook.
5,Personal and Powerful,"It was hard to put down this powerful and moving book. From the first page it grabbed my attention and I was riveted. For a first novel, it was extremely well written and pulled you in to its subject material. Highly Recommended"
4,Invaluable tool for science fiction world building.,I bought this globe several years ago as an aid in science fiction world building. I use it all the time. It's great because it gets around the usual bias/distortions in maps and globes which don't show polar regions very well. The globe gives me a better understanding of the physical shapes and features of Earth. I only wish the globe were bigger.
4,good choice,"I like the hard plastic door. My lab had a passion for chewing on the vinyl flaps of other doors and now he cant get his teeth on this one as the magnets catch the door within a swing or two. Seems to keep out the drafts better as well. The only improvement I could recommend is a little bit more weatherstripping and a more robust latching sytem on the nighttime door. Overall, for the money spent, I'm sure this was the right choice. Bonus: the hard door doesn't trap all the body oils and end up looking like a car wash rag. Easy to clean."
5,Good large Dog door.,Shipped and packed very well. Installation was very easy. Came with plenty of parts for all the different door thickness that you could possibly have. It keeps the house warmer and the dogs adjusted to the rigid flap within a couple days. Nice upgrade from the old worn out dog door.
2,CHEAP!,"Disappointed with this piece. Everything is cheap plastic and looks like it should be $10 and not $50. In addition, the plastic above the magnets in frame has started to lift up making the door difficult to operate. I recommend searching for something better."
1,partly unconcerned,"made the mistake of reading and believing the previous reviews.wish i could have sampled this before deciding to buy.basically the album is an ill conceived attempt at trying toemulate george clintons funk mob - many have tried and many have failed,this is no exception.the tracks sound mundane and one dimensional which is disappointing considering the sizeable amount of personnelinvolved in the production.only on the final track 'let me come inside' does the captain earn his stars,displaying soulful vocals not evident on the rest of the album.perhaps with hindsight this is the route he should have taken."
1,WARNING: Wrong film! Do not buy this DVD.,"I bought this DVD expecting it to be ""Steamboat round the bend (1935)"" (aka Steamboat Bill) Starring Will Rogers et al. It is actually a mislabeled version of ""Steamboat Bill Jr (1928)"" Starring Buster Keaton."
1,THE WORST RECORD I HAVE EVER BOUGHT,"THE COMPILATION IS OK BUT IT'S A LOW QUALITY RECORDINGTHE SOUND IS POOR AND LOW, I HAVE TO TURN THE VOLUME UPA SPACE BETWEEN ONE SONG AN OTHER IT SHOULD BE CONTINUOS,IN THE ORIGINAL ONE THERE'S NO SPACESBESIDES THIS IS A CDR CDR CDR CDR CDRBE CAREFUL I REGRET BUYING THIS CDI CAN MAKE A COPY ON MY OWN BORROWING MY FRIENDS'ORIGINAL CDNONE STAR"
1,Poorly Edited!!!,"This could have been a great album. The reviewer from Elmont, NY says the rest. What a shame."
2,For bigger kids,A lot of the games are complicated for most kids younger than 7. This game would be good for traveling to plug it into the tv at the hotel. The graphics are like the Atari games from the 70's.
3,Gift for Great-Nephew,If you like retro this is the game to purchase. It was purchased as a gift for a great nephew who only knew the Wii and Playstation. He and his cousin seem to like to play it.
5,My 2 year old LOVES this book!,"My 2 year old daughter absolutely loves this book. She has been reading it many times a day for over a month! It's a counting book too, and this one gets her counting better than her other books. I first got it from the library to familiarize her with the spooky stuff she'd start to see at Halloween time, and I didn't want her to be scared. It's an upbeat, friendly book, and now she likes ghosts, witches, and skeletons. I had to buy it because I couldn't renew it anymore!!"
4,Great Pan,I love cast iron cookware. I also really really love LeCruset but they don't have a 4 quart pan that is appropriate for making sauces. This pan is perfect for that use. I've propbably already used it at least twice a week and it has preformed very well each time. Allows one to cook at a very low temp and get just the exact right amount of a slow simmer with no sticking or burning.
5,An Amazing Pot,"I recently received this pot for my birthday. I have made not only risotto in it, but a few batches of soup too. Its very heavy, but I grew up cooking in all cast iron, so its what I expect from a pot. What inspired me to write a review was that the other night I put some split pea soup on to cook and then ran over to the store. I guess I didnt turn down the heat far enough because when I returned there was about a quarter of an inch of burned split pea soup on the bottom of the pan (of course everyone in the house just wondered what that smell was instead of checking the stove). It took me less then ten minutes to clean the pot completely! The burned mess scraped off very easily and then all I had to do was scrub a little. I love this pot. It made up my mind to register for this collection for my wedding."
4,Marian and Dizzy,"This recording from January 1985 is well worth getting. Marians guest is Dizzy Gillespie, one of the greatest Jazz Trumpet players. Whilst Dizzy's Trumpet playing was a little past its best by this time he could still belt it out when he wanted to. Listen to the lovely version of 'In A Mellow Tone' on this recording. There is no greater examination of a Jazz musicians skill then when they have to play solo or without bass and drums. On this track Dizzy still has it. However I suspect he could only play Trumpet for shorter periods of time by the date of this recording. So on five of these tracks Dizzy plays Piano at which he certainly competent, but I expected more Trumpet.Marian McPartland is the perfect host. A gifted Jazz Pianist in her own right and she gets the best out of her guests. Dizzy of course is funny, and fascinating to listen to. Telling stories about a few of the greats - Monk and Ellington to name but two.Well worth getting, just a shame there wasn't more Trumpet."
5,great book,"I think every engaged couple should read this book. It gives great insight into marriage and many of the dangers that face it. If you're already married, it's still a great book to read and work through with your spouse."
5,a must read for christian couples,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Rainey's style of writing is enjoyable to read. I was entertained and educated on the finer points of christian marriage and parenting. Excellent.
5,SSG/BSN 15 Ball Cart,I purchased 2 of these racks for our school. These are excellent quality and extremely sturdy. I have purchased other racks in the past for more money and the quality is not near as good as these racks. The fact that it holds 15 balls is an added bonus. I would definitely recommend this rack.
4,"Fine, not spectacular.",I like this product but don't think it did a lot to reduce dark circles. Mostly a good moisturizer.
5,great convertor!,"No issues with this convertor. though the finishes are yet to reach the factory finish, but still better than expected."
1,Poorly constructed,"After one trip the screws that hold the unit inside of the housing all fell out, leaving the contents rattling around which contributed to wires coming loose. Not recommended!"
3,book,The book arrived at top speed and I have enjoyed reading it. I will be glad to do business with you again.
5,great bulk buy,I normally buy these boxes for about $4 each in NYC - so this was great - and it was shipped the very next day
1,You Can't Make It Up,"On Monday August 22, 2011 the Pop-Tarts, Frosted Strawberry, 12-Count Tarts (Pack of 12) was $25.91 and was not available for subscribe and save. The product is now priced at $32.89 and is available to subscribe and save for $27.96 08/24/11 the price went up in a matter of two days. The price of items or products on special do not go up in price they can be lower but not raised. Where do Amazon get its pricing scale from items are priced all over the place. You have customers paying different prices for the same items the only different is the flavor. Flavor does not determine the price of an item.Amazon is trying to get over with these made up prices, lower the price when want to and raise them to make money on special offer for the month. Subscribe and save goes up often I purchased the Oreo pack of 48 three months ago for $15.13, a month before they were $15.30 now they are $15.98"
4,Is the warbled video the only one available?,"Okay so most people know that the Kapoor family are royalty of Bollywood cinema, if you didn't know, then just watch Om Shanti Om, i think it is mentioned one or two times:) Anyways, i even believe that Mr. Shammi Kapoor won an award for this film, so my question is this, is this warbled video the only copy available?Got my copy the other day, my version is the one shown by Shemaroo, now the picture itself has been restored beautifully but i swear i feel like i'm gonna be seasick by the end of the flick because the whole picture waves or warbles.If anyone out there reads this and knows, please leave a comment, i don't wanna purchase another copy if there is something wrong with the film master.Still gonna watch it because i love Shammi, he is hilarious and has excellent comic timing!"
4,saddle bags map,Nice map for major roads etc. These are not detailed maps by no means. But they are perfect to be in my harley saddle bags when I need a map to get home or etc. They are all covered in plastic and fold great. I have them encase my cell phone GPS does dead and I have no idea where I am.
4,almost perfect,(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)This was such a sweet tale and it was nice to finally see a gentleman as a hero as oppose to a rake. Jane and Edward were perfect for each other and I loved their story but knocked out a star for the disappointment near the end. The day after they finally kiss and you think it could only get better but it took another turn and I didnt like it. Yes it all worked out in the end but I dont think it was necessary for what her stepmother did after finally discovering her. It would have been perfect otherwise but still a great read. I would most definitely read this again and will look for more of this author's books as I really liked my first taste.
4,Wiffles,Good product. Used for a baseball team and so far they've held up pretty well. The only issue is that they are a little pricey but I guess that is expected because they last much longer.
1,What is going on with these games?,"The Great Escape is how you are supposed to try to stay away from being a prisoner at a jail. That is what all games are, but this game has a bad way to doing this. The graphics are bad, the controls are bad, and the game is not even fun. I stopped playing after the first 5 minutes and wanted to return it. They people at EB Games said it would be $.75 because it would be considered a trade in, no wonder. Who would buy such a game that has a replay value of 0? I am sorry for the people who created this game because they did a terrible job of doing this game. DO NOT BUY!!!"
5,The Master of the Stratocaster,"This CD Rocks, capturing Robin live is the best you can get,He mixes it up with some Classics, such as Bridge of Sighs with awesome solos, Daydream, Day of the Eagle, Too Rolling Stoned etc.The man still has the chops even at 60 yrs old! This is a ""MUST HAVE"" for any Trower fan, espeically if you've seen him live ( I've seen him 18 times )The quality is top knotch, nice bass, vocals are clear.If you enjoy Electric Blues ( SRV, Clapton ) then you'll love this!"
3,Just Alright,For some reason I was not moved by this show that much.Trower seems like he really relays to much on his cry baby on this date.I was a little bored with basicly the same led over and over again.I've seen him play ten times better in the past.It's your call on this one I'm just passing you a tip of how this DVD moved me.
2,smoke and mirrors,"robin trower has really lost a lot of his playing ability, same sound but no blazing licks and just a lot of trickery. two stars for the music and his new vocalist is quite good."
1,Ordered It.......where is it???,We ordered this 2 weeks ago and we don't have it yet. Wondering if this really exists!!! Is this some kind of a joke??
4,"Eldo Pop (Brazil, Rio de Janeiro)","O show é muito bom, entretanto, eu só daria 5 estrelas se o vocalista fosse James Dewar, que, junto com Robin, marcaram época com essa banda fantastica!"
5,Old guys can still do it.,These old guys are still doing what they do best.............flat out rock and roll....with a rough edge.They do me (49 years old) proud. Good quality sound on my surround sound system too.
3,Good Show,"I have seen Robin recently, and the strong playing he showed us that night is consistently displayed on this DVD. He is still a great guitarist."
3,as a present,"I got this CD for my husband for Christmas. He's a big fan and says he likes it alot, but wishes Trower had picked some songs with ""bigger jams"" on it."
5,Still has that great sound as in the 70s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Robin Trower was the first concert i went too & it just blew my mind ! I was standing rt. in front of him and had a great view of cranking out on his guitar!!!!!!!! The dvd takes me back and that was around the mid 70s I'M 48 & Robin still has it!!! Also not to leave out the others , The lead singer also sounds just as great now as then along with the rest of the band !!!!

4,3 1/2 stars for a small club concert,"Trower still has his guitar playing gifts as he performs here at a small club in Bonn, Germany. Backed by a drummer, a bass player and vocalist (Robin doesn't sing much), he hits some of the greats including a nice merge of ""Day of the Eagle"", and ""Bridge of Sighs"" but some of the other ""newer"" songs are easily forgotten. What isn't forgotten is Trower's guitar playing, and this is when every song soars. This DVD looks pretty good when upconverted. It has a 16:9 (widescreen) aspect ratio and has a choice of compressed Dolby Digital 5.1 or PCM Stereo)"
5,DVD Concert review,DVD was perfect. It arrived on time. The concert is superb. Robin turned 60!One of the 10 best guitar players in the World. Watch this DVD and you will know I'm right. The song selection could be better.
5,a pathbreaking biography,"Long neglected by critics and historians, Victor Serge was one of the last century's greatest political novelists and a participant in some of its most epochal events. This is the first full-length biography and Weissman brilliantly mines the newly-opened Comintern archives to recount Serge's heroic battle against Stalinist lies and deceptions."
5,Solid show,"This was the best UFC I've seen. I didn't recognize all of the fighters that competed but every fight was good. Heavyweight Pete Williams (from my state, Texas) really impressed me in his bout against Travis Fulton. If you leave the room to get some popcorn you could miss the lightning fast ending. The light and middle weight bouts were both solid as well. The championship was between Bas Rutten and Mark Coleman student Kevin Randleman. This fight went the distance and the only bad part of the whole card was the decision at the end. I won't say who won but in my opinion it was the wrong man. That shouldn't prevent you from buying this tape, though, because it's the best UFC since the Gracie, Shamrock days."
1,BEWARE!!,"Do not buy this book unless you are aware that Amazon.com has the title listed incorrectly for this book. They have the title as Walking Side by Side:Devotions for Pilgrims (Emmaus Library). This book is in fact not said devotions. If you look ""inside the book"" you will see that the title is In the Shadow of God's Wing:Grace in the Midst of Depression. Make sure you are ordering the book that you really want."
4,Like a Cliff's Notes for Levi-Strauss,"A fun adventure through the complex world of Levi-Strauss and his theory of Structuralism. It contains cartoons, pictures, and fun comments which bring Levi-Strauss' complex theory to a sort of clarity.Although I still don't find any practical use for a theory that is based upon the Western concept of binary opposites and deconstruction of mythology and fiction to explain culture, I am at least better able to understand the theory."
5,Amazing book,The book was used so had some markings but did not affect the ability of me to read the content. Arrived before it was promised so that was a good surprise to go out and find it in my mailbox a week before I expected it.
1,Even more proof...,"...that some people are still as closed-minded as ever. As the one pastor reviewer noted that the book isn't about witchcraft, it was about how to deal with manipulative people in your church. Does anyone else see anything wrong with this? Yet again, another ""good Christian"" writing a book using Witchcraft as a synonym for evil - WHEN IT ISN'T.What happened to not ""casting the first stone"" ?"
1,stop using witchraft synonimously with evil,"It's 2007 and it's nice to see that witches are still being portrayed the same as in the times of the burnings. Real witches do not want to be christian, that's why we are pagans, so why would we be infiltrating your churches. This book is a terrible misfortune to other generations, still placing peaceful, loving, nature respecting people in the same line as SATAN and EVIL, we do not believe in these concepts, please truly inform yourself with accurate literature before condemning innocents."
1,Complete Idiocy,"I am very concerned with the way witches have been infiltrating the HOLY church, all REAL CHRISTIANS must put a stop to this at once! OH, no! HOW could this be happening? Please, do all of us a favor and find out the facts before you write the book. If you knew anything about wicca, you'd know that we aren't interested in converting people to our religion. We just want to have the right to practice our religion in peace. So, please stop trying to discredit other religions and get on with your life."
1,paranoid nonsense,"This kind of garbage book would be laughable if it didn't waste so many trees and frighten the gullible. What arrogance, to suppose that ""witches"" haven't anything better to do than infiltrate evangelical christian churches. The author's conceit apparently knows no bounds!"
5,Looking beyond the person to deal with the problem...,"As a Pastor I am ordering several more copies to give as required reading in our church. Godwin deals with the spiritual root of the outward expression of people in church . This is not a novel or romantic book for casual reading. If you always wondered why certain people you know act like they do , you will find excellent insight from this seasoned minister of the Gospel.No it is not about witches and brooms and cauldrons , but it is about manipulation and control and power seeking people and how to deal with them in your church and your personal life."
1,IT SUCK'S END OF STORY GET THE LP IF YOU CAN FIND IT !,THIS CD SUCK'S... ! ITS NOT CLEAR THEY HAVE OTHER'S SAME COVER OR OTHER COVERS SAME SONG'S BUT THIS............ ''HOT PRODUCTION'' SUCK'S DONT BELIEVE ME BUY IT AND FIND OUT WHO RIGHT !.... P.S. SEND ME A BUY BACK FOR CLUEING YOU IN I'LL JUST TAKE HAFE FOR TRYING TO SAVE YOU MONEY LET'S SAY A KIND OF FINDER FEE FINDING OUT THE TRUTH BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED DOE AND THROW IT AWAY YOU CAN THANK ME LATER OK !
5,THE DEFINITIVE HARLOW BIOGRAPHY,"David Stenn's book is a meticulously researched, superbly written biography that answers the questions that inevitably pop up when we encounter Jean Harlow's image on screen -- and simultaneously contemplate her early death: Who was she? What was she really like? Was she happy? Why did she die at 26 years old? Stenn provides the answers, some of which are quite sad, all of which are true. He is also an artist with a real feel for Harlow's achievement as an artist. This is not the standard Hollywood biography, which lists one movie and then another. Stenn provides the sweep of the brief but extraordinary life of this young woman who was easily one of the most likable and adorable human beings of the twentieth century."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"From what I've read so far, it's the best of what is available. However if you are looking for in-depth information on her work experiences then you will come away disappointed. However Stenn has done wonderful research on her personal life and backs up what he states. But it's all about her personal life and a little on her work, so if you are after more than her personal stuff, you will be disappointed. And for heavens sake, don't pay hundreds of dollars for it, wait until it turns up second hand somewhere or check out ebay like I did."
5,Replacement Weber Handles,"Simply stated, these handles replace those old rotten wood handles that leave much metal exposed which lend to easy burned fingers! Buy these and get the safety you need.These handles virtually cover all the metal on the two sides and the top with rugged and attractive white plastic bearing the Weber logo. Also a plus is that they are easily installed with a Phillips screwdriver. These handles can be used not only for the lid, but for the two side handles on any Weber ""Kettle"" style grill. Most grills would require the purchase of 3."
3,Handle,"This handle only works if the metal arms that hold the handle to the cover are still in tact. My handle came apart at the lid, so not a solution to the problem"
1,problem,"although i have used this brand before, there is a problem with distortion with the lenses. i am not able to use them for very long, without getting a headache. otherwise, in look and fit they are fine."
3,Roll handle takes some getting used to.,"I got these for my Mother who pretty much lives for gardening. She tried these out & found the rolling handle feature hard to get used to. I tried them also & found the rolling action gave them an insecure feel. I've noticed Mom has returned to using her old rusty secateurs. That speaks volumes to me.Maybe you'll like them, maybe not."
5,For people who like to look at details,"This book is part of a large collection of books. These books make you look for clues some which are very small but make you say ""duh."" These books can be very addictive and make you want more and more."
4,Uniden Expandable Phones,"Other user of these phones have detailed some of idiosyncracies of these phones, so I won't. Let me say, however, that these phones were easy to program and work flawlessly. We have had them in our house for awhile now and have been entirely satisfied with them. One feature we especially like is the ability to assign differnet ring tones to each handset. Sure is nice to have the phone in the bedroom, for example, to ring with such a soft, soothing tone. Overall, these phones are great!"
4,Good phones,"These phones are very nice, the sound quality is great. My only complaint is that the phonebook is not easy to use, you have to learn what buttons to push to open it."
2,Disappointed,"These worked fine out of the box, but after a couple weeks started showing ""out of range."" This now happens very frequently. The phones can be reset by unplugging the battery and plugging it back it in, but that seems like a ridiculous thing to do nearly every time you want to make a phone call."
1,Very disappointed,"I've had these phones for about 6 months now and from day 1 the reception and interference has been horrible. The seller kindly exchanged the phones for me and I still have the same problem. Confusing, especially when the microwave is on. I realize some phones would have interference with a microwave, but from everything I read this particular model hadn't given anyone any problems in relation to this. Also, the buttons on all the phones aren't working anymore, specifically the the talk button and the center menu ""key"" buttons. I calle Uniden and I can have each phone fixed for $60.00 a piece. No thanks! Time to look for some new phones."
4,Excellent Cordless Telephone Set,"I recently purchased this Uniden cordless system with caller ID, speaker phone on hand sets and many more features. I'm very satisfied with the performance and quality of this product and the reasonable selling price from Amazon."
1,Old Item,This item was 4 years old and only worked for a week. Merchant should have disclosed it's age!
2,Wigo total Ceramic Flat Irons,"I am an African American with natural hair and I have been dealing with natural hair for over 13 years and I have to say good flat irons are the key to maintain & straighten natural hair. This particular flat iron does NOT contain that key. These would be good for practice or for your preteen daughter to have as a first set but when it comes to quality,(at least with this item)that old saying is still true...""You get what you pay for!"""
4,So Soft Baby Hirl,"I am very happy with this product. It met all my expectations.I had ordered it before & had it personalized, I was disappointed that I couldn't do that with this order."
1,Haven't purchased this doll,"Want to purchase this doll for my soon to be one year old daughter but there seems to be a problem. As far as I can tell, she doesn't come in African American. I don't think I need to say more."
5,13 month old loves this baby!,"Our daughter loves this baby doll and cuddles her close in her crib. She is not speaking yet - but says ""Ahh"" and kisses her doll lots. We were looking for something durable that I could throw in the washer and something that had no hard parts so we could leave it in the crib overnight. This doll is perfect and she can pick it up on her own and cuddle on her own."
3,"We loveall 4 of our ""GA's""","My daughter got this doll when she was 4 mo old. At 6 months she called it ""GA"" and the rest is history. That was almost 8 yrs ago. We have 4 of them and Santa may bring a new one this year. It has been very, very, very well loved. It has healed hurts, cured illness, soothed nightmares and just generally comforted a beautiful little girl for 8 years. They wash beautifully, keep there shape and though over time tend to loose their fabric (in spots) they always give back great love and affection. They are soft and easy for baby hands to grasp and big girl hands to hold on to, too!"
2,what's the big deal?,"Despite the rave reviews, I had my doubts about this doll, and I was right. Why would a baby prefer a doll with closed eyes? I was trying to decide between this doll, and another soft doll, the ""Cuddle-Up Play Pal"" by the Learning Curve. (discontinued, unfortunately) I ended up getting both (the last Cuddle-Up!) - and my 7 1/2 month old ignores the ""So-Soft"" doll. The first time she looked at it ,she frowned at the closed eyes and tossed it aside. How can a baby feel connected to a doll that seems to have no eyes? The other doll, the ""Cuddle Up"" has round, clearly defined eyes - she absolutely adores it. Maybe she will appreciate the So-Soft doll when she is a little older, but I would say get a doll with her eyes open as a first doll for a baby. Learning Curve, bring back the Cuddle-Up Play Pal - you had a winner."
4,Not enough Harry,"This is a very nice program. But rather than Secombe singing with choral accompaniment, you actually only hear Harry on six songs. The excellent choir has eight songs to themselves and there are two solos from the organist. Given that this is primarily an album featuring the Westminster Choir, their name should be at least as prominent as the soloist on the album cover."
1,Misleading Title Presentation!,"The title of the book is given ENTIRELY in English, with '(Russian Edition)' tacked on at the end of a very long title. There is NO BOLDING or any other attempt to highlight that this is NOT the book that the Title suggests it is (the English version).The cost of shipping and handling to return this book exceeds its value on return, so I am stuck with an unwanted RUSSIAN version of a book that I didn't even know HAD a Russian version!!!!VERY QUESTIONABLE ETHICS INVOLVED HERE! IF THE BOOK IS RUSSIAN, THE TITLE SHOULD BE IN RUSSIAN!"
3,Be Thankful - but not for this remix,"Bought for the wonderful ""Be Thankful...."" but I am not thankful for what I got. Didn't want a remix by someone called David Todd - I thought I was buying the original mix. No mention on the listing that this wasn't the orig. David, stick to the day job (unless that's remixing classics). Grrrrrrrrrrrr"
3,"I'm not thankful, either...","I must agree with Mr. Casey's review. I paid IMPORT (>$20.00) for this CD and was bitterly disappointed that the song ""Be Thankful for what you got"" was a remix - not the original product. Fortunately, I already had a copy of the original on a Various Artists' greatest hits CD. But still, I'm out $20+. So, beware and read this before you buy!!!! Three stars..."
5,Truly a classic!,This album is simply superb. William de Vaughn is a very underrated singer and deserves much more commercial success.I'm still looking for a copy of his great 'Creme de Creme' track - WHEN will that be available on CD?!?
1,Be Thankful.... Discofied??? No Thanks,"William DeVaughn's seminal work was Be thankful for What You Got (the main reason for buying this CD). It was a double platinum (2 million) best seller, in 1974, and deservedly so for its message of pride no matter who you are and what you have (or may not have). THIS version (x2) is some cheap disco remix of the original, carrying nothing of its soulful depth of feeling. Buy the original CD without Mr DeVaughn's photo on the cover. It is available on Amazon for a fraction of the price of these imports. It has the original versions of his works, and you will then Be Thankful For What You Got."
4,Almost Perfect*********************,"Well this release is definitely impressive. The overall recording and performance is much better than the WAREHOUSE release. However, there seems to be some pressing flaws on tracks 1 and track 3 that keep this cd from getting 5 stars from me. I had bought and returned this disc twice because of what I thought was a flaw in the manufacturing of the disc. As it turns out the flaw is with the mastering of the original source material. Here's a rundown of what you may notice. On track one you can hear what sounds like the disc skipping but the music is not affected. On track 3 there defintiely is some skipping going on about a minute and 10 seconds into the track. Overall this is a great addition to the expanding JOY DIVISION catalog, however these flaws are worth pointing out."
4,Mick Australia,I found this Air Show movie to be very good and for the price its a great deal. On the site it clearly says it will only play in Region (A) which is US & Canada. I live in Australia which is Region (B) and it plays on my Panasonic DMP-BD45 player which is locked to Region (B) movies. So to those people in Region (B) you might have the same luck as me if you buy this movie.
5,Well Worth The Money,"I have to write this review because I thought the previous negative comments about the background music were really unfounded. I am glad I went ahead and purchase the DVD. I thought the background music was appropriate and the rest of the contents were well filmed and produced. For someone who has no knowledge about airshows, these 3 DVDs provided great insights into the amount of work and planning required to make airshows possible.Plus, the images contained in the DVDs are sharp and the colors are very vibrant.All in all, I would say there is really nothing to complain about the DVDs and they are well worth the money!"
4,Good But Not Great,"I found this book to be good but not great. It is a mix of a short Hemingway biography and a travel book. For those that want an introduction to Hemingway and like to travel, it is an enjoyable read and I highly recommend it. If you are looking for a detailed Hemingway biography or a travel book only, then I would not recommend the book.Also, some chapters are better than others. For example, the short section on Pamplona (within the chapter on Spain) is well written and entertaining. But the rest of the chapter on Spain and bullfighting is rushed and incomplete in my mind, given that bullfighting was a subject of so much of Hemingway's writings and that Hemingway's ""Death in the Afternoon"" was practically an English language treatise on the subject.Further, at times, the book seems to be more of an independent travel book than a ""following in the footsteps of Hemingway"" book.As I said, good but not great."
1,Make sure you get the right book,"Being a big Hemingway fan I was very excited to get this book after I first discovered it. I was looking forward to photographs of Papa and the places in his life. That's what I expected after ""looking inside"" another edition of the book at Amazon, which was the only choice to look at. I sure was surprised to get a little paperback with not a single photo. I saw the book I thought I was getting for $5 in a used bookstore the other day. There is no warning that the book you get is entirely different from the one you get to see. Albeit I only paid $1.41 plus $3.99 shipping for it from The Big Book Sale - it is not what I wanted or what was advertized. I will be disputing the charge. BEWARE."
4,A Teriffic Travelogue,"If you are going to engage in some armchair travel, you could do no better than to have Michael Palin as your guide. I love all of his books, possibly even more than the accompanying TV shows. The only reason this one gets four stars from me, instead of five, is by comparison- I thought the conceit of following Hemmingway's life's path was less engaging than some of his more challenging itineraries (but add the extra star back on if you're a Hemmingway fan). Like others who have reviewed here, I was compelled by reading this book to seek out some of Hemmingway's work, and I think I was able to appreciate it better knowing something about the man. (But I'll admit, given the choice of reading him or reading Palin, I'll take the Python any day of the week.)"
5,Hemingway's Travels,"This was simply wonderful. Along with an overview of Hemingways' favorite haunts it was loaded with marvelous photos, and insights into the people that made Hemingway's life. Palin is funny, discriptive, and never, for any reason, negative. His descriptive skills and fabulous humor, the maps, and photos, make this a special 'keep this one' book for me. I loved every page!"
3,Its okay and kinda of pricey,"I'll agree that this unit looks great and is designed very well, but when it comes to music, Sony always hits deadpan for me. They proved it again with this unit. If you're looking for something that plays music to move you, keep looking. I've purchased amazing mp3 boom boxes from other companies that absolutely floor me with clarity and depth of sound, but the Sony S2 makes everything you play sound flat and tinny. The mp3 ability is always a plus, but what would have pushed this unit over the edge would have been a headphone jack for playing other mp3 units through it.Overall, its okay."
3,Small things make BIG difference,"I bought this boombox as I liked it's design, appearance and most points I given to it's builtin bass speakers - not to mention it's MP3 & ATTRAC3 plus capability. So I bought it and after a while, I realized that remote will definitely make my life easier ... and after some time I started feeling MP3 player (or PC) line-in is missing in this $120 worth boombox. These 2 small things (no remote & no line-in) made me to hate this wonderful boombox and finally I returned this boombox and bought Sony ZSSN10PS PSYC CD Boombox (Black). Yet to receive this new one, hope that will make me happy - as this new model has remote and line-in (little bit cheaper than ZS-XN30, and not much bass - but I think I should be OK with this).So I felt like small things make big difference - hope Sony will realize it soon."
4,Pretty good,"This unit is pretty good, for it's size, it's certainly nothing elaborate, but the sound is pretty good, for the size of the unit. The one thing that really bothers me about it, is when you unplug it, then you have to reset your radio station, the volume and the megabass, which doesn't seem right, to me. It seems like it shouldn't lose that information. It's a little better than average, I would say, but not exceptional. It does have some nice features, such as a track finder, which makes it easy to go directly to the CD track that you want."
2,Failed After Two Years,"We owened this unit for two years, great sound. Used the MP3 ability only once after I first bought it. Power on and FM/CD buttons finally gave up and couldn't start unit after two years and junked it. Unit never wet but did sit outside in covered patio 1/2 the time in humid summer conditions, still was supposed built for conditions."
5,You must have it!,"In order to prepare each surgery, every neurosurgeon has to read and re read some seminal works, atlases,texts, review articles,etc. Of course, you gain expertise in cadaver practices and in each surgery you perform, but sometimes you need the advice of an expert and fellows, believe me, Chris Adams gives you a lot of sound advice in this text. This is a book not only for residents as ""California mom"" wrote in her review of this work. O.K., maybe it does not cover everything,but it is worth to have it. I am very sorry about the high prices I am seeing for this wonderful book, maybe Chris Adams can make some reprints or a new edition."
4,gem book,The book was not as described. It was heavily underlined in certain areas and was a more used condition than described. Never the less the book is usable.
5,Fun and Educational,"This book is fun to read, both to children and by children. Without even realizing it, they will be learning key musical concepts. The illustrations are great! And they are large enough to be seen by a group of children if the book is being read to them."
3,A good start but...,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this isn't quite complete. All of the grand marches, dirges, and (understandably as this was recorded in the 1950s) unavailable-at-the-time marches are missing. Some non-marches have been substituted, confusing the issue. However, this is the largest and most readily available compilation that goes beyond the ""greatest hits"" sets that so permeate the CD bins. (There IS a truly complete set, but it's only available in Japan, and for whatever reason, it's not being mass-imported to the States at the moment. Go figure.)For now, I would recommend this to someone who has not purchased a lot of other Sousa CDs so as to avoid the inevitable overlap. You won't have everything, but there's a lot to enjoy here."
5,Delightful!,"I have read all of Jill Churchill's books with ""Jane Jeffry"" and she does not disappoint me- ever.This mystery has the hectic christmas events we all are familiar with, some progress in her romance with Mel, her wonderful friend Shelly (aka Watson to her Holmes), and a mystery to keep you guessing. What more can you ask? If you enjoyed her earlier work you will definitely enjoy this latest caper of Jane Jeffry. Definitely worth five stars."
4,Really 4.5 stars,"I have started at the beginning and read all of the Jane Jeffry books in order. This is one of my favorites! In addition to a ""cozy"" mystery, there are some very, very funny parts to the dialogue and various situations that make this book stand out. The introduction of Mel's mother added quite a bit of humor and was a nice touch in developing his character.Quite an enjoyable read !"
4,Heaven sent,"Great door, actually heaven sent for me. No more messes in the house,after she got overr being scared of it,and keeps the draft out completley. Living in NY u know there is always a cold draft. The only problem is that it's not that easy to put in but having the correct tools probably would be the best, and alot or muscle. The price is great. Compare it to the stores and you will see what I mean. Delivery time was great as well. Had it in two days. Thank You sooo much."
3,Pet door. Poor fit for thick wall.,"Claimed to be a wall/door pet door as it can telescope for thicker walls. It could be a wall pet door if your wall is only 3 inches deep. The inserts that came in the package are supposed to hide the side exposed bare walls inside the pet door. These inserts are useless if your wall is thicker than the inserts. So we are now living with a door that functions, but until we figure out what product to insert on the sides we will have to deal with the unfinished look.I had to take out the magnet because it closed so well and tight my Westie was scared of it and refused to use it. He uses now but it is drafty because it won't seal, but that is our problem because we took out the magnet. Would be good for cold/ windy country because it does have a good seal when the magnet is in place. Your dog just can't be scetchy about the sound or having to push the door open with his head or nose. I am not over thinking the whole project because I didn't spend a lot of money on it."
2,Dog,"Great. My dog loves it. Easy to put install. Door parts are solid and sturdy. Only drawback is that if my dog comes in while forced air furnace is running, it sometimes does not close all the way."
3,Hard to install!,"This door comes with very poor instructions, it took my husband and I 2 days to install it. You have to tape the frame to the door and trace around to see where to cut. Taping it level is a trick. I advise taking the door off the hinges to do this. Then we cut it out, and it was too small for the framing, so we needed to cut it bigger. Then once we finally got it in, the door would get stuck, we had to redo the screw holes. It was a mess. Then the inner wall frame that came with it, wouldn't stay, so I hot glued it to the door.Also it only comes with one small wheather strip gasket, and is drafty, so we rolled up small strips of cloth and put in the gaps, as well as using cilicone to seal it up. It only has the one hard plastic flap, so if you are in a cold climate, as I am, either pay more for two flaps, or put a towel or rug up on the inside as a second flap to help keep the cold out."
4,important considerations,"In a world of normative statements and directives, we must consider both the positive and negative reports of benefit or ROI. This books has compiled a number of reports that one may not agree with, but it does make you think. I found it to be a unique source."
3,Exotic and strange...,"Cerberus Shoal had been highly recommended from brainwashed.com so I went to buy the recommended CD, which was not in stock, so I bought this one. Let me first say, if there was ever a band that defies classification, it is Cerberus Shoal. They aren't really post rock, or experimental...they are just weird, and I love it. There is a wise range of music on this album, from the strange electronic (they use alot of more exotic instruments: dholak, djembe, balilaika etc.,) tones and sounds on songs like Changabang I, II, or III, the jamming Breathing Machines (the standout track on here) and the two beautiful songs at the end which feature vocals.So why 3 stars? I thought they could have done better than they did with this album, and I think Mr. Dog Boy is a better Cerberus Shoal album to buy than this...but overall a good album."
4,Bobby O & His Banana Republic,"This is a great Bobby Orlando CD with a blend of Euro-Pop and High Energy music influence. It starts with ""A Man Like Me"" which is a nice dance tune, and continues with ""Confusion"" which sounds a bit on the New Wave side. Continues with ""Now and Forever"" a romantic slow dance song and proceeds with ""Pump It Up""... a really faster song... but the really big hit is ""Whisper to a Scream"" which features Claudja Barry, here is where the value of the CD is placed... this 9 minute High Energy Disco song remains a favorite among 80's party people. ""Mixed up World"" sounds like a song that the Pet Shop Boys would've done, and ""Somebody"" will keep you wanting more of Bobby 'O'.. while ""Hangin' On"" is the final cut, it does end the CD with a slow song. Bobby 'O' continues to be the KING of Hi-N-RG and this Album now available on CD will make a great addition to your dance music collection. I recomend it."
1,Not no way,Every year I attempt to buy one of these books. Every year they either show up months after Christmas or not at all. Sorry for the bad review but it is what it is.
3,Estoy Decepcionado,"Cuando compré este producto pensé que me mandarían el mismo que aparece en la imagen a mi casa y resulta que me enviaron un bote de color morado, no blanco y por ningún lado aparece la marca de CREAPURE, sólo dice CREATINE MONOHYDRATE, por lo menos tengan la decencia de decir que las imágenes varían mucho del producto que venden para que no engañen a sus clientes, estoy muy enojado y decepcionado, porque no venden lo que ustedes dicen, adiós y espero jamás volver a comprarles algo a ustedes."
1,Tool Kit Review,"I am not happy with this product. The price what they charge for this product is not worth. Niether the tools inlcuded are good quality nor works properly. My experience with this tool kit also terrific, first time when i used the soldering iron it just worked for 30 minutes. then it failed.I will not recommed this product."
3,Good but not great,"Nice set, could have used a ratcheting screwdriver w/assorted drivers, and an anti-static wrist strap, but I added these inexpensively from Harb0r Freight. The case is solid and comes with a nice shoulder strap, but it could be bigger. I use a Rosewill RTK-090 90 Piece Professional Computer Tool Kit at work and the tools in that kit seem a little cheaper in quality than in the Cables to Go kit. All in all a good compact little kit."
2,Basic Reference Book,"As stated already, this book is a very basic reference device. Good for beginners who want an introduction into the types of firearms seen in most films and combat pictures. There are, however, serious mistakes. The worst has to be using a shot of a Soft Air (toy product shooting plastic BB pellets) version of the SA80 and claiming its the real thing. You can actually see the white pellets in the magazine housing.This is sloppy picture editing and considering the book is small should never have left the proof stage with that error. Buy only if you are thinking of starting a reference libary and even then give it to your kid brother once you've had a read throught it"
1,99 cent store item,"Do not waste your time with this product. It is not alphabetized. The pages are very thin. The spiral is very cheap plastic. This item belongs in the 99 cent shop--- no joke! This address book was literally printed from someone's home computer and sold here at Amazon, I think. I recommend Internet address book ISBN 0768321670."
2,internet book purchase,"I was not happy when I received the book beacause it looked bigger on th eweb site than what it really came to be, I kept because I alwasy can use it but I am not satisfatied. I needed it to be bigger, now I am confused on which one to get. This is the first time ZI purchase from Amazon and is not what I expected.Thank youZulma"
1,Is this a spoof product?,"If you are going to publish fake reviews for a product you should at least attempt to disguise the fact. Plurals do not require apostrophes, yet every one of the editorial reviews contains the same grammatical error. The only logical conlusion is that Darlene Bertram, Captain Wahoo, Alex Gifford and Joe Humphries do not exist as these reviews were clearly all written by the same person. Seems a bit dishonest to me, testing people's gullibility - and that is apart from the fact that this is the most pointless book since How To Speak French was translated into French."
2,Address Books Need Tabs,This really is the perfect size but tabs would make it easier to sort through 300 entries!! Perfect for your purse or to hide in a desk drawer.
2,limited usefulness,"On the plus side, the book is spiral bound. The book measures 5.5 inches by 4 inches and I find it too small, although others may find it perfectly sized. The real fault is that there are no index tabs, which I find very inconvenient in an ""address book."""
1,The Road to the Recycling Center,"Paging through this book I bought back in 1999, I realize there are some significant outdated and proven unsuccessful treatments listed in here. I like to donate books I'm finished with to charity, but this one's going straight to the paper recycling center. That's how I will help to improve our toxic world. I couldn't in good conscience let this book out for someone to get a hold of potentially harmful and inaccurate medical information. I'm an advocate of naturally improving our immune systems, but some of the treatments here are unsafe. Other reviews of this book here have noted these dubious treatments, such as intravenous hydrogen peroxide injections, so I need not repeat. Please, just don't buy this book."
1,Do not buy this book,"This book has no pronunciation guides, and is therefore useless for the English learner of Danish. Also, the book lacks basic gender labelings, and other information that the English speaker needs to properly acquire Danish language usage."
1,Not for native English speakers,"This appears to have been written for Danish speakers, because pronunciation cues are in the English section only!Pronunciation is the hardest part of learning Danish, and a book that can't help you with that is pretty much useless."
2,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for","Save your money and get a better dictionary. This one may be fine for casual use, but a serious student of Danish would be better served by a more comprehensive dictionary."
1,Don't buy if looking for a REPAIR manual.,THIS BOOK DOES NOT TELL YOU HOW TO DO ANY REPAIRS! It is merely a general overview of how a jet ski works and how to get better performance out of a stock machine.
4,neice of deceased story of The Walker Case,"Being told this story from my father, the brother of Sarah Walker in James Welch's High Sheriff, has always been of a fascination to me, than to find out it was in print, I had to read it, the account of the case is remarkable. great book- of his other reminiscences this book is a great read."
2,"Bright Lights, Big Deal","""Rapture"" is unrelenting in its sameness throughout, and the rest of this CD sounds like a pale copy of work that this gifted composer created during the late 1980's. I am sad to give it a pass."
3,baby liked,"I first got this when my baby was only 4 weeks old and she did like it better then the soothies. However it is still too big for her. Sometime just like the soothie she would gag on it. I gave it 3 stars because i think 0-6 months is too big of a gap. Wish they had something smaller. Now using the born free kind, they r sized just right.I also bought from another vendor here on Amazon and I was slightly upset when I got a phone call from company saying even though I ordered pink and clear that it was actually for any color and I did not have a choice in it. I asked if it was possible for me to get the pink one and she said most likely but when it came in the mail it was blue. Not that big of deal but when u order something u expect to get what u ordered."
4,Works on a Sunbeam grille,"I had to provide 1/4 inch bolts, but was able to easily adapt the wheels to my dated Sunbeam grille."
5,"""Soft and Cuddly Giraffe""","I got this plushie as a gift at my baby shower. My newborn loves it. It's soft and cuddly. She can sleep with it at night and if it moves it won't wake her up with a rattle or lights or any other noise. Other toys that make noises are great for playtime but my daughter can't sleep with them at night or when she naps because they would wake her up and possibly even scare her. I knoe there are a lot of plushie's out there bout this one is the softest, cuddliest, most huggable we have, and we have over 50!I would deffinitly recomend this plushie.I give this 5 soft stars!-Liz"
5,~~Too cute & perfect for the little one~~,I got this from my baby registry for my soon to be daughter. It starts very easily which will make it more fun for baby. Too cute and so soft!
2,Save your money,"If you played the funny and charming version of thison the playstation II and expect this to be anything atall like it forget it! The opening screen is identical butthe game itself is a nightmare of a comparison. Thisdoes not have any of the qualities of the playstion version.No funny comments, no where to pick anyone up. It isjust like pole position with a funnier looking driver.BORING, SNOOZE, my 7 year old daughter hates it andwants her money back, no refunds on open games."
4,The Racing Rage!,The Simson's Rode Rage is great if you like Adventure/Racing all in one. I liked this game because it was different from other ordinary vidio games. I hope you enjoy The Simson's Rode Rage as much as I do!
2,Boring,"After the second day of playing this game, i never played it again. All you do is go around picking up people and dropping them off at places. Another thing about it is i Don't like typing in passwords, so that was a negitive."
3,My First Game,i have played this game on X Box and i liked it so much i got it for my gameboy advance yesterday. the text and content it suitable for all players so i can even have the kids i babysit for play it. with 3 diferent game to play the fun never stops..this was my first choice for a game and i am glad that i picked it.......
2,no,because didnt lke the game didnt want to work for my kids so is there a way i can get my money back
1,BOO,I hate this game i have it for playstation 2 and it is so cool because it is 3-d but the game boy version is stupid and the graphics are horrible so if i were you i wouldn't buy it
2,The Stinkiest game ever!,"Hello. My name is Mike Roch. I am 9 years old. I got this game for my wife's anniversary present, and 2 days later she divorced with me. The graphics are ok, the sound is weird, and the horn of the car is depressing. I only played becuz I ticked off the passenger. Now, does anyone know what 5+5=? Long story short, only Sadamm Houseen would buy this game! Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!"
3,No bonus DVD included,The description clearly states bonus DVD.yet when getting this today there was no DVD of any kind with it.Also the price listed here for regular price is way off.You can get one of the play sets at Target for the price Amazon says.Overall did not find this toy all that fun.The dolls are not overly pretty. I have seen better in the other sets.Might ask mom to go get one of the play sets from Target now though since they are 75% off and this set really needs more to go with it to make it any fun at all.Really wanted it for the DVD but one does not come with the set.
1,awful delivery,"I haven't tried the equipment yet as I keep on waiting the delivery. They called me yesterday that it will be delivered between 12pm and 5pm. I came home early to receive in person but now is 6pm and they haven't shown up yet. Hopefully, they will deliver it tonight. Beware potential buyers, if you don't mind waiting forever, go ahead. I won't buy similar item ever again if the same delivery company is mentioned."
4,Schwinn 418 Elliptical Trainer Review,"Assembly was mostly strightforward and only found one part marginally out of alignment. System works well and should provide years of good cardiovascular exercise.Was not at all happy with the time it took to receive the shipment but after it arrived, I was pleased that I waited and did not cancel the order."
2,several bad parts received,The instructions to put this product together were very difficult to understand. Several hardware parts were missing such as screws and bolts.Two parts were defective. THe main wheel cluncks terribly with each rotation. I am in the process of having the company send me replacements for these non-working parts.
2,Disappointed,I have had my Schwin 418 Eliptical for 6 months. I am 165lbs and use it 3 times a week for 30min. It was squeaky around the foot pads. I had tightened all the screws and used WD-40 to see if it would work. The squeakiness had decreased a little but not much. I noticed that the eliptical had a slight wobble to it as I moved with the foot pads back and forth. I thought no problem the machine still works and I can get my work out even with the noise and slight wobble. At 3 months I tried to increase the resistance level to 14 and the whole front wheel makes a harsh grating noise and locks up. At 3 months I also noticed a consistent thumb as the front wheel would turn about while using the machine. I suspected the machine was not of good quality but today confirmed my suspicion. A bolt broke off that linked the foot pad structure with the right hand upright structure. I chose Schwinn for their quality but am very disappointed.
4,Fairly happy with purchase,"I bought this elliptical a few months back and have been fairly happy with my purchase. I only have a couple of complaints. The heart monitor is not accurate. It's always much lower than my actual hear rate. I have my own polar heart monitor so I'm not too worried about that function. Also, the calorie counter is much higher than the calories I think I actually burn...but it makes me feel good looking at a 1,000 calories burned in an hour!!!"
1,Disapointing,"not steady at all, poor quality overall - the handles are mis-aligned; therefore, both handles and pedals are out of balance. display is poorly designed and hard to read, not informational and useless. returned it within a week."
3,Great machine but broke 1 month after the warranty expired,"I did a lot of research on elliptical machines and selected this model because it was a consumer reports best buy and it had great reviews on amazon. It is not as sturdy as what you use at the gym, but for an economic home machine it is very good and I was 215 pounds so even for bigger people it is ok. I purchased it in February of 2007. It has a 2 year parts warranty and welds broke on the main support arm at the base after 25 months. I am hoping Schwinn will cover it under warranty."
4,Pretty Decent,"I ordered this elliptical because of the positive rating it was given on CR. The price on Amazon was the best around by at least $200 and with free shipping, it was a no-brainer. The machine seems pretty sturdy and well-made and was easy for me to assemble. I've enjoyed many workouts on it and I'm sure I will enjoy many more. The different programs keep it interesting and I can continue to increase intensity as I get into better shape.I've had the machine over a year now and I'm happy with it. It does squeak sometimes, but that is easily fixed with a spray of silicone lubricant that is about $3 a can at any home improvement store. The only other negative thing I could possibly say about the machine is that the calorie count is way off. It says that I burn over 1,200 calories a workout when in reality, I've only burned about 300.The positives outweigh the negatives by far with this machine. It's been a year and I'm still very satisfied with my purchase."
5,Great Value for a Quality Product,I have been using the Schwinn 418 Elliptical trainer for a couple weeks now and I am glad that I bought it. The quality of the machine is very good. This is the best you can get for the money. Assembly was easy and the instructions were step by step. I would recommend this to anyone who does not want to spend thousands on a commercial grade machine.
4,A great choice,"This Elliptical is exactly as described. Easy to assemble with minimal tools, smooth operation, and fairly good design. I only have 2 issues with it, and both are only slight. First, not being what you would call petite, my shoulders are a bit broad, resulting in the moving arms striking my forearms while trying to get a pulse on the stationary pick-ups. Second, the programs that change the resistance with your pulse, when your hands are taken off the sensors and then put back on, the heartrate increases on the screen slowly, from your beginning heart rate...which drives up the resistance even though you are at target heart rate. It would make better sense for the computer to remember the heart rate last recorded, and use that as a baseline for a smoother workout.Overall, I agree with consumer reports, which was the driving reason why I bought this particular unit, a definite best buy. Easy to assemble, easy to use, very smooth and no racket or vibrations.Great stuff!Mike"
2,Customer Service is nonexistent,"The product was fairly easy to assemble and worked great the first few weeks. Since then there is a very loud knocking noise any time the elliptical is used. I asked Schwinn customer service to come fix the problem. 2 boxes of repair parts showed up at my door but they have still not scheduled a service call and it has been 3 weeks. I've emailed them and called several times, but I just wait on hold for 20+ minutes without and can't reach anyone. Customer service is pitiful, at this rate my warranty will expire before they fix the issue. It's a shame because this is otherwise a good machine."
3,Meh,"This thing doesn't compare at all to machines at a gym. I suppose I shouldn't complain too much since it's much cheaper, but what really bugs me is the electronics. It seems like it was designed in the early 90s and hasn't been updated at all. A dim LCD display that looks like a solar calculator, and the calorie counter is way off, saying I burn 1000 calories in half an hour, based on what I did at the gym it's about half that.The heart monitor SUCKS and barely works at all.Fixing these things would not raise the price of the equipment much at all"
4,This elliptical is worth it!,"I have been using this machine for almost 3 weeks now and absolutely love it! It works very quietly after I silenced a few squeaks with WD40. It was relatively easy to assemble. The package was missing a couple of washers and I had to call customer service to have them shipped to me. Customer Service was friendly and expedited the shipment with UPS Air. Before you assemble the machine, make sure you note down the serial number of the product (for warranty registration and customer service)under the flywheel assembly. You get a really good lower body workout without the impact on your knees from a treadmill."
2,Same problems,"Unfortunately I am having the same exprience as some of the other reviewers. My console does not work and turns off any setting I try to make after 4 minutes. I have called customer service 4 times and written twice to both Nautilus and Amazon. I should have gone ahead and returned it immediately, but it looks like it could be a great machine if the console worked correctly. They have told me it is the cable from the pedals that is not working correctly and that is installed at the manufactor. Then they say they have technicians everywhere, but.....in my area. Now they say there is one, but he is on vacation and will call.....very soon. Meanwhile Amazon says my 30 days are up. So I may pay a substantial amount of money for a machine that turns off every 4 minutes."
4,WORTH THE MONEY,"The only bad things about this product is that a screw was missing and that the screen is hard to read. Besides that I love it, It was a well worth money. I am 5'3"" and the stride is perfect for me. It is a very smooth machine."
4,Schwinn 418,"I was pleasantly surprised when the product was delivered a lot earlier than I had expected with the free freight offer. I had heard it might be 4 - 6 weeks. It came in about 2 weeks.Assembly was a bit frustrating. One of the bolts on the base assembly would not go in completely because the interior threads had extra material obstructing it, and still sticks out about 1 inch. Also the water bottle that was supposed to be included was not there.I'm very satisfied with the performance so far. It does require weekly maintenance of tightening screws and bolts to keep the squeaks away, but with moving parts, that is no surprise. I'm satisfied with the purchase."
2,Clunker,"Purchased the 418 Elliptical 5 months ago now. Reviews after a week or two may not tell the whole story. After 3 weeks the clicks, squeaks and clunks wouldn't go away by just tighting bolts so I called for service. It took 4 weeks to get a tech. to look at it, he had to order parts which took another 4 weeks. Replaced one of the main flywheels inside and the track rollers under the pedals. It's not as noisy now but still makes a clicking noise on every rotation and intermittent squeaks and clunks. Thought by spending a little more on this machine than the cheaper competition these problems would have been avoided, not so.The heat rate monitor is not accurate but the rest of the electronic features have been working fine, unlike many other reviewer's comments."
3,Works well but too noisy,"Overall, there is plenty to like about the Schwinn 418. For a relatively inexpensive elliptical trainer it feels very solid, and, when using the different preset programs at different levels of difficulty, it reacts like you would expect. I was missing two washers necessary for installation, and it took quite some time to get them from Schwinn once I called. Secondly, it developed a squeak after a few weeks that is very annoying, and nothing within the installation/maintenance manuals mention how to handle such an issue. Turning the ipod louder can only go so far...."
2,Lots of problems,"1. got lost in transit, big hassle2. usually smooth but sometimes makes strange screechy/crackly noises3. feels flimsy4. i read the golden reviews too.. don't get it. just a very average system"
4,Amazon and Schwinn together,"First, I have to give a very high grade to delivery of product which I purchased through Amazon (No, I don't work for them). Many reviews have complained about delivery of products. I was able to change delivery date and time easily. The delivery truck was too big to reach my house. The guy worked with me to transfer it to my vehicle. The Schwinn 418 Elliptical Trainer was not easy, but not that difficult, to put together. But once working, it is great. I can feel the muscles working that I would be using if I was running outside."
4,Getting in shape,"I have the elliptical set up but have a couple of questions for customer service. I called one evening but they had already closed so I'll try again. When connecting the main part to the rear ""feet"", I could not align both sets of bolt holes. The upper arm rocks within the lower part of the arm so I'll see if they have a suggestion about that or can tell me where I went wrong. I have used it several times though and am pleased with how it operates. Now, if I would operate as well, it will be great! Delivery time was good."
5,I Love My Schwinn Elliptical!,"I absolutly cannot express how much I love my Elliptical, I have used tread mills for years and I thought their wasen't anything better but this machine has proved me wrong, I wouldn't use a tread mill again for anything, my workout is finished so much faster and so much more efficient that it's hard for me to believe I spent that much time on a treadmill. My Schwinn Elliptical is the best gift I ever received!!! I absolutly Love It!!!!"
4,"418 Elliptical Evaluation, very good.",I recently purchased a Schwinn 418 elliptical trainier for myself and family to use. Very good construction. Solid feel (I am 250#). Computer display is adequate. I bought this product based on the Consumer Reports recommendation and am very satisfied with the purchase. It took me about 2 hours to assemble this product out of the box.
1,"Noisy, unstable - Do NOT buy","Assembly was easy (all parts available) even though the instructions are poor. My wife used it only a few times (4-5) in the first month. From the second month onwards, it is extremely noisy in the main body, no amount of tightening, reassembling, oiling has helped reduce the grinding noise.The whole machine wobbles and more importantly, the left (footpedal) roller sometimes slips out of its groove (can cause serious injury). Stuck with it and it is occupying a lot of space. Plan to junk it or sell it a huge discount. DO not buy, even if Amazon or others offer free shipping and discounts.Have had it for 3 months."
3,"works, but...","got this a month back, and used it for maybe 6 times till now. Works great and does what it does, but its started to make an occasional grinding noise inside the main unit. Hope it doesn't break so soon.."
4,Good for the price,"I researched ellipticals on the web and was impressed by the 418(high ratings and good price). Assembled it in ~3 hours. The instructionsweren't great, but it wasn't too hard. I've had it ~3 weeks and sofar it works very well and I'm glad I bought it"
3,"Irritating noises, questionable durability","I had this for 1 year before I sold it. I only used it maybe 15 times, but I stopped doing so because it developed a clanking noise when the pedals would move. I probably should have really tinkered with it, but I decided to give up on it because it became loud, annoying, and felt cheap.To be fair, the first few times I used it, it seemed quiet and perfectly fine. This might be a good machine if you are willing and able to try and problem solve as noises come up..."
5,I loved this book,"I found the beginning especially touching as we see the horrors of WWII through the eyes of an innocent child. The back end of the book is very moving and inspiring as Andy Grove flees Hungary, leaves his home and family, and makes his way towards America.In a time of great fear and uncertainty, this story demonstrates the will to live, the will to be free, and the potential that exists in each of us if we but dare to take risks."
4,"Must be heard to be enjoyed. Up there with ""Night""","I picked up these audiocassettes free from a store and I don't regret it. I got it because one of my favorite pastimes is reading biographies of great entrepreneurs. I am currently taking an IT class and I listen to the tapes on my way to school. I am so inspired by hearing his story and the narrator gives the right amount of emotion to Andrew's words. It is at times funny, painful, and historical. I haven't finished it, but I plan to, so was disappointed to find out that this book doesn't really deal with the time in his life where he founded Intel. In spite of that, I rank this book up there with ""Night"" as an excellent memoir to tell about the tragedies of WWII for people of Jewish descent and he and his family's triumphs over adversity."
4,Perservering in great adversity,"I found this to be an enjoyable, easy read. In fact, my 7th grade daughter read the book and did her book report on this autobiography. In spite of the fact that this is an ""adult"" and contemporary autobiography, I was not afraid or concerned about her reading the content.I recommend this book to anyone who interested in reading about growing up in Nazi and Communist occupation. It was truly inspiring. Worth buying and keeping."
4,An Inspiring Autobiography,"I don't like to blabber on like a pretentious a-hole, so instead I will say it's an excellent autobiographical story which left me feeling hopeful."
3,"Read this book or the content, not for literary strength","I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Grove some time back. He's an intelligent man, with a powerful persona and strong sense of character.I was surprised then, when I picked up the text. Swimming Across did not meet my expectations from a literary perspective. The presentation is very simply written and seems to be directed at an individual with a 6th or 7th grade reading level. I nearly put the book down and opted for another as a result.The story however, is compelling. Mr. Grof and his family found a way to survive, compete, and eventually excel despite very long odds in Nazi and Communist dominated Hungary.Read this story for its content (it is stirring). Read this to understand the character development of a leader. It is likely that your respect for the individual (like mine) will have grown."
2,Childish memoir,Andy is a wonderful person and a genius - but not a writer. This book is simply childish.Sorry Andy.
2,Ain't nothin' like the real thing,Poor remake of the Phil Spector classic (one of the greatest albums ever made). Why bother if you can't improve on the original and there is no way anyone can improve on the original. Save your money honey. Just make sure you have a mono copy and a stereo copy of the original. Ain't nothin better.
3,Description review...,"It would be really helpful if the description actually indicated whether or not a battery was included. The other folks commenting say this item does not include a battery and I believe them. Okay, so if I am going to need a battery, how about telling me what kind of battery this takes? Again, it's not in the description.Maybe one of the folks that bought this item can add their battery comments as well as how good it floats (if it does), how good the beam is, and how waterproof it is if if falls out of the boat.I did some additional research for the good of the community. Here is my understanding of the specifications. I don't own one yet, so I can't guarantee this info.Battery: One 6-Volt Spring Terminal BatteryLightbulb: KPR-113Lamp Life: 20 HoursLamp Rating: 4.8V 0.75ALamp Output: 51 LumensDimensions (in): 8.843"" x 5.520"" x 5.923"""
3,"3&1/2 Stars, great intro to one of the most influential bands of all time","This is a great place to start if you're new to the Kinks. While it's not their greatest album (see Arthur and Village Green) it is a necessary buy in order to fully appreciate this band. Now I'm a completest and I fully believe everything the Kinks put out from 1964-1971 (Kinks thru Muswell) are must have. This album has the two mega hits that redefined rock n' roll ""All Day and All of the Night"" & "" You Really Got Me"". While these are ultimatly the best tracks on the album, there are many other gems on here you would not get by simply purchasing a Singles or Greatest Hits collection. If you have the means, you should pick up the package ""3 Classic Albums"" which includes this one, Kinda Kinks, and Kontroversy. It's a huge task to listen to all three albums and disect them (70 some odd songs), but well worth the listen(s)."
5,A More Mature Baron,"Baron, like all of us, is getting older and his yoga reflects this. He is gentler, more careful but still challenging and motivating in this session. This workout is a slightly abridged version of Soul of Strength, as another reviewer noted. Overall, this is a nice session which starts gently (more gently than most videos) and flows well. It includes poses which may seem less familiar to yogis who have been working on Bryan Kest's 1995 series or Baron's earlier series. The flow is put together in a different order so that poses like the one-arm balancing or side plank pose may seem easier than in Bryan's early series. Overall, an excellent change of pace and a welcoming workout. Nevertheless, I would recommend the live dvd more for a better value and a slightly deeper workout."
3,"More, More, More",I was only able to listen to 30 seconds of each song. But the 30 seconds of each song was great. I wish I could hear the entire song.
4,tight party Band,Fat Larry's band always had soem tight Grooves.they didn't get alot of juice with all the Competition that was out back in the Band where Bands were concearned but they always Brought some fun&Catchy Hooks to the Mix.
2,beware!!!,beware - another cd distributed by hot productions which a CD-R not impressed. they should not be allowed to sell cd-r's
3,Good Unit - Not Long Lasting,"Less than two years ago, I was in search of my first DVD Player. I decided I would go with a DVD/VCR combo, as I still had some old vhs tapes and I liked to record programs. I decided on this unit (at the time it was fairly expansive), as I didn't want to go cheap and end up replacing it in a year or two. Well that's exactly my problem now. About a month or two ago, it would occasionally not play DVDs, instead giving me a disc read error. I was able to fix this problem, only to have it occur a couple weeks later. Only this time it would also not eject the DVD. It would take me 10-15 times of turning on/off the unit and hitting the eject button before it would eject the dvd.Overall, it would be a good unit if it lasted longer."
2,Careful with this One!,"Out of the box, the unit would not play a DVD to the end due to over heating and the audio dropping out. Tried several DVDs over a couple of days with same results. Plays for about an hour then audio drops out. By the third DVD the color was shifting to red images, back and forth. Zenith customer service doesn't pick up their phones either! Careful with this one!"
1,Its crap!,Skip over this product unless you want to spend your hard earned money for a DVD player that lasts less than one year!Service from LG Electronics is horrible. The offer to send pre-paid Airborne shipping labels wasn't followed up on until I raised a stink. They swore the labels could not be sent to my P.O box - when in fact they finally were tossed into a #10 envelope and mailed anyway!Be prepaired to be asked for proof of purchase (this took two phone calls) - THEN asked for a $45.00 fee for a refurbished unit if over the 90 day warranty period (yet another phone call). All the time being laughed at by the incompetent phone reps.No more Zenith products for me.
2,Returned same day,I bought this and returned it the same day it arrived. The picture was jumpy and the color kept shifting to purple.
4,"A great balance between price, features and space.","I purchased this item as I wanted to save some space in my entertainment center. The DVD VCR combo seemed a great option and for the price I thought it was a bargain. You get two high end machines in one box, less then half the price you would pay for two seperate machines and half the space consumption.The machine is very quiet, no squeeking when rewinding tapes, no buzzing when playing DVD's so you get the imression its worth alot more then what you paid for it. Also I love how you can plug it into the tv, amp etc... from the front of the machine, it's convienent if you move the machine around alot. Also it's good to hook up a video games machine to it.All in all its a great machine, cheap and worth it."
5,Easy to use and saves space too.,Since the price of this combination unit is only slightly higher than a free standing DVD player I purchased it to replace an aging Toshiba VCR as well as a first DVD player. It is simple to connect and just as simple to operate. After several hours use in both DVD and VCR mode I can say that I am very happy with this purchase. I would recommend this unit to anyone.
2,Junk,My player lasted only 6 months and was used very little. The DVD player would freeze up after 10 minutes of use. Zenith said they would repair it for 45 dollars. Looks like it was designed to last long enough to get past the 90 day warranty. I'm done with Zenith products.
4,Looks great,This toy box looks great with out decor and we like the fact that is doesn't have a lid for our little ones hands to get shut in. You can also see through the sides so you know what is in there which is great. The only downside I found was when putting it together the plastic was scratched putting it in the way they suggested. It doesn't look horrible and I'm sure it would have ended up that way regardless over time.
1,Don't buy!,"This toy bin is CHEAP!! It comes flat packed but even then every corner came bashed, cracked and shattered. It's smaller than I thought as well. Spend a little more and get something a six year old can abuse because that's what's going to happen and this product is not it."
3,Good to start,"Loved the see-thru nature of this toy bin, and the open top makes clean up a snap. We've been mostly happy with it, except the wheels, um, suck. They keep falling out of their holes and don't screw back in in any meaningful way. First it was just one that popped out fairly often, but now it's all of them. We're going to have to put in some casters of our own that are more reliable."
5,An honest review,This game is perfect. I have a 5 year old cousin and we play it together. But to review this game I must be honest.The PROSPerfect graphics ( as close to the way I rember them for pooh and the others)Hard and Easy gameplay foy a parent or friend to explain and help a kidCool story ( esp. if the kid you are playing the game with has or have had bad monster dreams as my cousin did you can help them work through the problem with this game. Now when he has a bad dream he thinks piglet is there to help him)The controlls are pretty easy for use to understand and helpThe CONSTo hard and scary for a child if you do not play with them and explain what is going on ( if you play with them this does not apply )All in all this is an excellent game for family to get toughter and play if one of the players are a kid under 12. I just hope this helps someone
4,great game for small kids,"We bought a PS2 and wanted a game for our small children 5 and under. The five year old can do most of the moves necessary, and the other two love watching the game. If you are looking for something your little kids will enjoy, then i highly recommend this game. Lots of simple puzzles, colorful scenes, and great graphics. fun for the whole family to play together. Lots of replay value"
2,Maybe good for children,"This is a game that you would buy for your child, but that's it. No one that calls themself a ""gamer"" should ever bother popping this into their gamecube."
1,do not buy this book. It is not good,"This guy has some processes which do not work. He skims over some important details in other chapters. There are some nice images in here, but the Coming into Focus is better.So, buy another book."
3,An Unsatisifying Ending,"When an author uses phrases like ""unspeakably evil"" or ""more then you can imagine"" or ""beyond your comprehension"", they are failing to express any content. That is the problem with this book, the last of the series. After reading the book, you are left with an ending that concludes nothing. The characters are interesting, the plot complex, and the action well written. All of this makes it terribly disappointing the the conclusion never really occurs. The author's painted themselves into a corner that they couldn't think themselves out of and it shows."
2,Disappointing rush job,"I WANTED TO KNOW THE ANSWERS!And I didn't get them. Nothing was explained or resolved satisfactorily, and I had to wade through very ordinary prose full of proofing errors to reach that conclusion. Characters behaved differently, issues previously raised weren't explored, and things were stated as fact that hadn't featured in the previous books. Infuriating concepts were dumped in at the last gasp in a futile effort to make sense of what had come before.Please, please, please, Messers Williams and Dix, take the TIME to produce real quality with your next effort; quality like the Evergence trilogy.What a let down!"
3,Australian SF Reader,"The few remaining humans, in engram form or otherwise, are caught up in a conflict between two opposing forces of mostly incomprehensible aliens, and the ultimate decision about whether the destiny of the species is organic, or inorganic, or both."
4,Intriguing theory about JFK'S assassination,"a very useful background to those of us who know little about the aftermath of JFK's shooting. tanenbaum never loses the thread of the tale, an admirable feat in these days of sloppily-written thrillers, and the ending is suitably downbeat. the only complaint i have is that the character of the hero's wife is a little outlandish and whenever she is involved, the novel staggers to one side under the weight of her personality. but that apart, it's a good read."
2,Not on par with rest of series.,"Tanenbaum uses his long running characters, Butch Karp and Marlene Ciampi to investigate the Kennedy assassination. Tananbaum was deputy chief counsel to the late-'70s House Select Committee on Assassinations. He has Karp play a similar role in this fictional account.Perhaps when the book was originally published the material was fresher and less 'conspiracy theory' rehash. Tanenbaum was certainly close enough to the subsequent investigation to bring real insight but thirty plus years later we have heard it all and it reads as second hand retread of every theory ever put forth.The book is disjointed - Karp runs down blind alleys and into all the roadblocks the original quasi-investigation had problems with as well. Marlene seems out of her element and the entire book dovetails too conveniently.Dinner and drinks with Tanenbaum while he gave you his real opinion on what happened, who did it and why would be priceless - the book is a pale imitation at best."
1,"Come on, get serious","This may not be the most disorganized potboiler I've ever read but it's certainly in the running for that distinction. The story jumps around like a bumper car at the county fair -- from Karp to Ciampi to one caricature of a PI to a different caricature of a PI to a confused criminal to a Mafia don... Evidently Tannenbaum wrote this book to express his displeasure with the Warren report, but it does nothing to discredit Warren's report or to suggest an alternative. I agree with him that Warren was a substandard moron who lived for the limelight, and the Warren report was pure BS. But this...? Come on Robert!"
5,Corruption of Blood,"when I first began reading, I thought ""Oh no, another who killed jfk book"" but I was wrong. This was very entertaining and well worth the read. Love the Butch/Marlene books but this one was GREAT."
1,Corruption of Blood,"A very poor book, not up to Tanenbaum standards which no doubt is why it is not sold by Amazon but must be bought from an outside seller. Offers no new facts about the assassination of Kennedy, only unfounded speculation."
4,A Beautiful Album,"""In the h-wing, in isolation for a month, fighting cancer, this project began..."" This quote from Kevin Hearn decbribes perfectly the mood of this album. It is, melancholy, calming, and at times depressing. A few songs, including Bonefight and Spider Arm, are upbeat and uplifting, but most on the album are slow and quiet, perfectly complementing Kevin's gentle voice.Many people may find this album too monotonous and sullen, but I like to think of it as a thoughtful rememberance of a very hard time in life. Those, who have gone through an ordeal like Kevin, will greatly appreciate this show of strength through word and music."
3,it is okay,"i thought by the reviews i read that this would be a much better movie than I think it is. while it is good, it seems to break off into smaller stories so if you don't pay close attention you might loose the plot. I have enjoyed several chinese movies much better."
4,Seussical CDs,The cd with the songs on it was a bit questionable as far as quality of singing. The accompaniment CDs were awesome. I just wish that there was a way to pay to download it... instead of me having to pay the outrageous shipping!
3,Somewhat old,Had to cut the tube since the cement wad too thick to go through the spout. Made it tough to spread properly but seems to be holding well
5,Worked for us!,This worked fine for a loose gasket. Would use it again. Good value for the price and not messy at all.
1,End up with an hostile child,"Disappointment in Lego clearly describes their newest releases. My sons are aggressive after playing Lego Racers 2. They themselves have pointed out that the drivers have only one goal in mind, to get that golden brick. They themselves question the fact that the drivers enter dangerous situations and behave aggressively to win. Children are not rewarded for thinking nor for considering the consequences of their choices. Safety ""stop, look and listen"" is disregarded in this Lego Game. Your child will not get anything constructive out of this game. And you'll end up with an hostile child on your hands."
1,Hard to install,"I have Lego Racers 1 and wanted to try Lego Racers 2 but could not get the program to work on 2 different computers. I tried on on windows 98 system but did not have 16 Meg of video ram. I also tried on 800 Mz pentium 3 with 128 Meg video ram but could not get to work. I called support but they said windows 2000 is not supported. Readme text with software says that program will work on windows 2000 but this is not the case. The program would be much better if the software diagnose the system prior to installation. I was very disappointed with the set-up. Game may be good, but I could never find out."
2,What a shame,"We loved Lego Racers (the original), and my son couldn't wait to spend some of his birthday money to buy Racers 2; I feel sorry for the poor kid. Although we have the computing horsepower to make it work (P3, 128MB RAM, 16MB video card, etc.), it still is not as smooth as the original, and the screen goes ""funky"" after one race, even after ""dumbing down"" the graphics. We have tried it on different computers, and get the same results. It's really a shame..."
1,Should not be named as a sequel that suggests an upgrade,"I took this game off my computer. My son and I both got frustrated with the game play. One mistake and you're essentially out of the race. It should have a skill level option to make some aspects easier but it doesn't. As another person indicated, only one person can save a game unlike the old one.Once a race/adventure is over, moving to the next is long and painful.Overall, if I had wanted a more realistic racing game instead of just a fun family experience, I would have picked a different title. My expectation of Lego is fun first!"
3,Not as Good as the First,"First, this is targeted at younger gamers, so keep that in mind.Now, my family loved the first Lego Racers title. The power-ups were great and with practice could really help you win the race. There were a variety of tracks with short-cuts and other secrets.I have been disappointed with the racing in the second game. There are aspects of it that are really nice, such as the variety of vehicles. And there are power-ups. But the power-ups are almost totally random. The race courses have no secrets to discover. The brick sets for building cars seem more limited than the first.In short, I wish that they had expanded on the original, rather than trying to redesign altogether.Good points: Exploring the island and a bit of a story line.Bad points: More Luck-dependent Power-Ups, Almost No Shortcuts"
1,"Sluggish, something wrong, NO customer support.","My son was so anxious to get this new release I couldn't keep him in place. And yet I've never seen him so dissapointed.My computer is a power-house that way exceeds the game's minimum requirements. Yet it's slow, sluggish, low frame-rate, no details, nothing. My boy gets impatient and turns the game off after a few minutes.I expressed my concern to Lego, but in a form e-mail simply replied that it not tested on Windows XP. Some nerve they have. The OS is out, and Lego isn't aware of it? Just to be sure, I checked with my video-card manufacturer (ATI Radeon) and their support service was just as useless.Caveat Emptor!!! Buyer beware."
1,Stinks in comparison to original,"Lego has totally missed their audience with this game. The original Lego Racers was a lot of fun and very easy for children to learn. Lego Racers 2 is a complicated mess...totally unsuited for children. There is LOTS of menu navigation. Lego characters talk in gibberish..you must read the most long winded text boxes ever. My five year old simply doesn't get it.What's worse, the racing portion (when you finally get to it) is NOT FUN. It's like they forgot what made Lego Racers (the original) good...simple fast gameplay. This one is slow, not colorful, boring, and the computer guys cheat very badly.I give Lego the big thumbs down on this one. Save your money and buy Lego Racers 1 instead."
4,"Good game, but needs a high performance computer.","Like Lego Island 2, this game requires a high performance computer. Although it requires 16M graphics card, I was able to run it with only 8M.Over all, it's still a good game, but it's not as good as the first Lego Racers."
4,"Above average mystery, but getting old","I would recommend this book to first time Handler readers and followers of the series. But a note to those reading the novels in order: while the stock phrases and jokes that crop up in not only every book and but then in every other chapter are endearing, they are losing their appeal.The set-up is very much like the previous books, (Hoagy's ghosting for a nut that only Hoagy can control, beautiful women throw themselves at Hoagy, Hoagy and Merilee fuss over Lulu, Hoagy eats and dresses well) and your anticipation may be more about the latest in the Hoagy/Merilee relationship than the murderer's identity.There are 2 more in this series after this one. Handler isn't updating this series anymore, and that's okay. I love Hoagy, but I also love the new team, Mitry and Berger. Handler was right to begin a new series; it's fresh, and so are the jokes!"
4,Intelligent page-turner,"An intriguing twist on standard whodunits with a rich stew of Holywood-in-Manhattan characters. The whole thing is a little gaudier than reality, but intelligent and well-written enough to enjoy it. The main character, Uncle Chubby, is from the first page intriguing; the first-person author, a literate foil to the television excesses. The characters are thoroughly interesting, and the writing is sharp and full of the right kind of detail. And the whole thing moves along. Great entertainment, while occasionally provoking a thought."
1,not good for food crazed cats,"Automatic Cat Feeder-CSF-3 Super FeederThe above linked feeder is the way to go for cats that are OCD about food. This feeder is easily broken into (knocked off of the cabinet) and hard to set the time for, especially if you have more than one cat.I bought mine at a garage sale for $5, and for that price, it was a good deal. I wouldn't buy it again though as my very food aggressive cat knows how to break into it or thump it just so with her paw that the lid opens up the next serving.All that said - if your cat is only a grazer and doesn't much care about dinner, this would work OK probably."
3,"Hard to figure out at first, but stood up to a FAT black cat","Little difficult to figure out at first; the directions are not helpful. However, once I was able to figure it out it stood the test against my aggressively fat cat!!"
2,Good idea that doesn't work very well,"I used a dry food feeder for my cat for several years, but now he is older and for health reasons has to eat wet food. I've tried to use this feeder several times now, following the directions exactly, and it seems to skip meals for some reason. The timer device is really hard to figure out, not at all like the electronic one on the dry food feeder. I don't understand why the manufacturer doesn't use an easier interface for this feeder. I am going to try one more time before I get rid of this feeder..."
3,Works well,We use ours to feed 2 meals a day so it lasts 2 1/2 days. Our cat paws at the dish and can get the lid to move backwards but as he eats everything in one meal there is nothing left for him to eat in previous meals. Then the lid springs back into place awaiting the next feeding. It takes a little practice to reset the timer correctly if you aren't feeding 1 meal daily for 5 days so you really need to make sure you rest the timer correctly or you can reset the meals but the timer won't feed until it catches up 3 days later and you have one hungry cat. But overally it has worked over very well.
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could.,I bought one of these and the flimsy plastic timing mechanism broke the first time I tried to set it up.
1,"Impossible to program, cheap construction","This thing is a piece of garbage. It is impossible to program. I tried for days with no luck. My wife took over and finally got it to work at the right times but the thing is falling apart. Pieces coming off particularly the plastic cover over the timer. Plus my cat can open the compartments to feed herself, so the thing is useless. I am trying to find a replacement auto feeder right now online.Just steer clear of this thing."
1,BUY THIS IF YOU WANT YOUR CAT TO DIE,"I bought this piece of crap online and it malfunctioned. After I had used it a few times,I was gone for gone 4 days-and it NEVER OPENED. My cat was so hungry she ate a plastic plant in my house and puked for 10 days-the plastic was coming up each time she threw up. However, less of it started appearing in her vomit so we took her into the doctor. $1750 later-blood work, xrays, surgery (had her stomach cut open), she's fine. I've written the company letters with copies of my bills and they tell me to return cat feeder to them WITH MY RECEIPT and get my money back for the feeder. Give me a break. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP! I hate to think what would've happened if I had been gone longer, if I had an older cat (she's only 2), or if my kitty had complications during the surgery."
3,Would not recommend for multiple feedings of canned food,"I bought this feeder hoping that my cat would learn to use it and quit waking me up so early to be fed. It took me several tries to get the timer set correctly. I use the feeder for one feeding of canned food, which seems to work fine, However, the ice pack is completely melted by morning, so I would not recommend it for multiple feedings of canned food. My cat learned to go to the feeder after two night of setting it, but unfortunately, he still wakes me up early wanting me to feed him again."
1,Not Good for Smart Cats,"Really liked this product at first. The directions are horrible, but once you figure it out, it is actually quite easy to set up. It worked perfectly for about 6-7 months for when I was out of town. Then, my cat figured out how to get the lid off and help herself. It only takes her a couple of minutes to pop the top off of it now."
1,awful product,I read the other reviews of this product and totally agree. This product is very poor. My cats have gone unfed for a couple of days. Luckily I also use a gravity feeder just in case. It's too bad because there is great need for a product like this that actually works!
2,"Good for a while, but...","I purchased this automatic feeder a little more than a year ago to provide precise portion control for our two cats and help them lose weight, and also so they would stop bothering me for food all day (I work from home). It took a long time to get the knack of this; I had to write down the steps on a post-it and refer to that for about a week before I got the hang of setting it up every day. Needless to say, if we went away for more than a day, we didn't even bother to try to explain it to our pet sitter, and instead have her come 2x per day, which defeats part of the purpose of having the device. Finally, after about a year, we noticed that one of our cats had gotten quite svelte, but the other had not. After some observation we realized that the larger cat had figured out how to defeat the device and was eating portions that were supposed to be for later in the day. I'm still not sure how he did it, but I've finally given up and am looking for an alternative feeder."
3,Worked for our needs...,"I used this for a timid, senior cat who would not do well in a kennel. I froze the canned food in the tray 24 hours before I used it. I left the first compartment empty and programmed 4 feedings. She ate them all. I don't think I would feel comfortable using this longer than 48 hours for canned food as I'd be concerned about the safety of the food. The ice packs aren't very thick so they melt too quickly. Otherwise it served it's purpose."
4,We have two C50s and they work for our two cats,"We have one voracious cat and another who is a grazer. We got 2 C50s so that when we were away, the grazer would have two chances if he cared to eat to get to a feeder. I admit, a smart and forceful cat could cause the battery to be knocked out from the bottom, flip up the protective cover on the timer and release future scheduled meals. As for our experience, the battery I think was knocked out only once and hasn't ever since we've had them since 2000. Our cats have not however flipped up the timer cover yet. It works for us to cover long weekend trips of up to 5 days."
1,I was unable to use it,I returned the item to the seller because it was used and did not work properly.
4,"Cute true story, period piece","I ordered this book because I remembered it from my own childhood. It is the story of a little girl, Curly Top, who lived next to the railroad tracks in Indiana. She never missed waving to a particular passenger train, the Twentieth Century, as it passed, once going east, once going west, each day. Her dream was to someday ride on that train. Her dream came true in a most wonderful way.This is very much of a period book, 1937. I found the story and the photographs of Curly Top and ""her"" train quite charming, but I doubt it would hold much interest for today's child. It is a true story."
4,Can't seem to get it out of my player,"Beautiful vocals, mixed with piano and a dancy beat for a combination they leaves you wanting to dance and sing-along at the same time. Very evocative, irresistible, tugs at your emotions kinda like Iris does. Favorite tracks: Perfect Stranger, Puzzle, Faked Emotions, Too Much To Handle. BUY THIS!!!!"
5,Great chew toy,Comes in small and large size. My small toy-sized puppy loves both sizes. Keeps her entertained for a half hour or more.
4,Marvin Sease,I brought this CD for a friend who likes Marvin's music.He says it is a really good CD and is glad I added it to his collection.
1,What is the moral of this story?,"In this story Moonbear and his friend bird see a kangaroo. Upon seeing the animal (who has escaped from the zoo), they decide they are dreaming. They go into their house and wreck it with abandon -- eating their winter supplies of food and breaking things. Then they go for a swim. Meanwhile the zookeeper tracks down the kangaroo and comes upon the house, which has been wrecked, not by the zoo animal, but rather by the bear and the bird. The zookeeper cleans up the mess. Bear and bird then return to face a cleaned up house. Every time I read this book to my child I can't help but think that the message is that actions don't have consequences. That is the opposite lesson I want my 3 year old learning."
1,"Cute, not functional","I bought this as a gift for my son. The first one didn't work, the numbers wouldn't completely light up on the clock. The second one wouldn't stop playing the different sayings and had the same problem with the numbers. It was delivered speaking in the box and wouldn't stop until the batteries were removed. When the batteries were replaced it would sometimes start speaking again. The only thing it has going for it is that it's cute."
1,Mater & McQueen clock a bust,"I sent this clock back. The volumn of the alarm was way too loud and you could not change it, it scared my son who is not usually scared by loud noises. Also it was very hard to set the time, date etc and very easy to change it on accident. Even my sone who loves Cars and everything about it, he is 5, asked me to send it back."
1,this thing sucked,"cute concept & was very cool when we initially used it - it stopped working after a week, returned it for a replacement - same deal, returned the 2nd one & were told they were no longer made. That's probably good thing! Bummer though, my kid really liked it"
2,"Great Disc, except...","This was a great LP when I first purchased it, but I decided to give my LP/12"" collection away many years ago after it got to be so much of a pain to move around. I just purchased the CD, and there is a problem.The music is just as great as it was on the LP.However...The LP did not have 2+ second gaps in between the songs like this CD does. They have chopped off the ends of certain tracks for some reason.Not a good remastering effort, HOT Productions...I don't mind a CD with a text only label, but DON'T modify the original content of the disc!!!I going to track down the LP and transcribe it to my PC. That might be a better solution...Buyer beware... If you're looking for this CD to match the LP 100%, it ain't gonna happen..."
5,Masterful,"A very well written text book. The complete story on plastics and plastics processing, clearly stated.He includes historical and application/business viewpoints, in addition to chemical and manufacturing.Professor Strong gets an A+!""I want to say one word to you. Just one word....Are you listening? ..."""
1,Horrible quality,"I have never received a more poorly constructed and bound textbook. I regularly purchase international editions and even those are printed on higher quality paper.the paper is not even glossy! Also, my book came with the pages in opposite order, thanks Prentice Hall!Material wise the book looks good, but that is no excuse to charge 125 for a book that might as well be printed on newspaper!"
5,A great book!,I had to buy this for a plastics class that I had years ago and have had to re-purchase it because it is a great reference book.
1,Get a new name,"This band should change its name so fans of the real blur dont get confused. Anyways, any band that has the word ""creed"" written anywhere in relation to it must in trouble."
4,The name is Somebody's Weird,"I truly enjoy this CD. 78 and Clear, Cut me down and Blur are excellent songs. As with most CD's, I bought this one for one for two songs to begin with and the others are growing on me.To Amish Cowboy.... The band name is Somebody's Weird. The album name is Blur."
2,On the right track.,This has potential! Creative lyrics. The songs could use more diversity. Too many songs of love gone wrong give it a lack of substance. Surely there is more to sing about in life. Otherwise a fun CD.
1,My kids (and I ) hated it!,"Both my children (ages 5 and 7) hated this video. The woman has a very strange voice, and my son literally said, ""She's freaking me out!"" and left the room. I bought this DVD for $[...] at a Dollar General store, and it wasn't even worth one dollar.We have From Silly to Calm DVD by Marsha Wenig, and my kids love that. My daughter's preschool owned a copy, and she came home and raved about it all the time. I recommend that one instead."
4,Return of the Gunfighter,"The movie is good. Scenery and actors are excellent. THe sound trackis not the greatest, scratchy all through. Robert Taylor uses the same saddle as in other movies. His horses always look good, probably his own, not the studios horse."
5,Very Thought-Provoking/Step-by-Step,"I was definitely pleased with Marcia's new book. Not only does it assist career coaches in defining a step by step approach to coaching effectively, but it is also a wonderful tool for someone who is stuck in that ""rut"" of the routine 9-5. For anyone who wants to achieve career/job satisfaction, this book offers many insights and thought-provoking questions that will assist in getting 3 steps closer to a fulfilling career.It is definitely one of the best career coaching books on the market! Thanks Marcia!!"
5,Excellent - Great Tools and Techniques for Career Coaches,"Career Coaching: An Insider's Guide has been invaluable to me in starting my own career coaching practice. Marcia Bench explains everything you could want to know about coaching people on careers, from industry standards to coaching techniques. Her unique Authentic Vocation model of career design provides very useful tools and worksheets to use with clients. Job search strategies, networking, and resume design are also all in this book. If you are considering career coaching as a career, or you are already a life coach and want to add want some tools to use with your clients who need career assistance, you have to have this book! Easy to read and very straightforward."
5,Ornamental Grasses,"The ornamental grasses that I purchased add fantastic color to any garden. Hirt's Gardens packaged them in pots, with styrofoam balls and enough space to breathe, I was impressed. I planted them right away and they took off. Excellent nursery...."
5,"Great product, great service","The plants were in great shape and delivered quickly. The price is more than competitive. Mad props, as far as I'm concerned.Erica Obey"
3,OK,"After reading peoples comments about this game I thought it would be a great game after reading about the great graphics. Well it turns out that the graphics in the race mode stink. The scenery never changes, you cant reverse, and you can barely go off the track."
5,Extreamly Good.,"I rented the game Top Gear GT Championship to check it out. My frien was convincing me to get GT Advance championship:Pro Concept Racing, but I needed to see which was better and i realized top gear gt championship was better because it has actual cars and it is just great"
3,"Not bad, but not great","This game is decent. The feature which allows you to create your own track is nice, but the graphics aren't quite up to par. Take my advice: DON'T GET THIS GAME. Instead, get GT ADVANCE CHAMPIONSHIP RACING. It has better graphics, more game options, and a better variety of tracks. You won't be disappionted."
5,awsome game!,"I got this game along with Mario Kart Super Circuit when I bought my GBA and I think it's the better game of the two! I think it's great because it's challenging, the cars have lots of specs that make each one good in a different field and that the specs can be tweeked. So if you want a good game for the GBA system and like cars I suggest you buy this game."
5,Super good,This game is a super good game. i just got it today and i felt it was much better than gt advance. iam not kidding as i really have both the games. the graphics are much better than any other game even better than Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.
3,Good graphics don't make the game,"I bought this game because of its outstanding graphics. It was made similar to iridion 3D. But, the graphics seem to exceed the game itself. Boring might be the word, but this being a gameboy advance game, I'd hate to shame the makers."
5,Help & Laughs for Expectant Fathers!,"As a father-to-be, Mr. Friedman's book is exactly what I was looking for: lots of laughs and good advice on what to expect during the pregnancy and after the baby is born. I let my wife pick all the general baby books but I wanted something that would ease me into our new situation, and more importantly, was fun as well. I've read some of the other books for guys like ""My Boys Can Swim"" but they mostly fall short of expectation. In this book the author captures both the high points as well as the somewhat messy situations that every father can expect in many laugh out loud chapters. I can easily recommend this book for soon-to-be fathers (and mothers)!"
5,"Written for Fathers, Perfect for Mothers as well","Written for fathers (and fathers-to-be) my wife laughed just as hard as I did as we made our way through this gem. She greatly enjoyed the behind-the-scenes look into the thought process of the new father (a few ""You're totally going to be like this"" comments were made), I was educated on some of the unexpected facets of parenthood, and the helpful hints at the end of each chapter are worth the price of admission. A playful and honest look at the first year."
4,Steele Crazy After All These Years,"Definatly one of my fav. eps, this video allows me to enjoy it again and again! I love the tension between Murphy, Steele, and Laura, as Laura and Steele vie for who can solve the case first. I love the bet that they make. ""One week in Paris, for one year of your life."" This is the episode where sparks really start to fly between Steele and Laura, you see them even closer two eps later in Vintage Steele, but that's a whole different story!"
2,Rather weak,"I have always considered Newman's Own products to be quite good, so I was excited to try out this coffee. I was dissapointed from the first sip. The taste is weak, like really watered down coffee. I'm going back to Emerils Jazzed Up Decaf.I also understand that Newman's Own, is actually produced by Green Mountain Coffee Co."
2,Dry Reading for Visual People,"DESIGN FOR COMMUNITYThe Art of Connecting Real People in Virtual PlacesDerke M. PowazekPUBLISHER: New RidersREVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: Design for Community has LOTS of reading and very little visual graphics to help a reader through the book. The back cover is designed to be a bookmark that just might get worn out while you try to get through this material. The size of the print is fairly easy to read but there is nothing in color to spark the interest of the reader's mind.As a design book for the web, this publication does not hold a visual person's interest and makes absorbing the material harder. Twelve chapters, a six-page content section and a nine-page index pretty well adds-up what is in contained in the whole book.If you are looking for something to spark your creative juices, this book is not the one to pick up. If you are looking to do a bit of dry reading, go for it."
4,Excellent PRACTICAL guide to building online communities,"My review of this book is simple - it tells you everything you need to know to build and run an online community, in plain language, without irrelevent academic theories.If you only buy one book, buy this one.I have been involved with online communities for a while, and because I have been unhappy with their limited functionality, have been creating next generation software for them."
3,Good introduction to online community building,"As a moderator for a 2,000+ community of swing dance enthusiasts (yehoodi.com), I was interested in Powazek's recommendations related to design and community-building online. I found some of the content a bit pedantic and simplistic, but I think this book would be an excellent introduction to someone thinking about starting an online-community."
1,CD,"For the review above.. the reason the game didn't work is that it WAS NEVER RELEASED. This game is NOT legit, DO NOT BUY IT."
1,IF YOU BUY THIS CD FROM HOT PRODUCTION YOU'LL BE SORRYYYYYY !,I GOT TOOK.. DONT YOU I SENT FOR TWO CD'S THEY BOTH SUCK I'AM GETTING THE LP MAYBE ON eBAY I HAD THE LP IT WAS GREAT PLAYED IT ALL THE TIME THEY HAVE ONE WITH A BLUE COVER OUT THERE THEY DID HAVE IT HERE BEFORE BUT HAVE NOT SEEN IT IN YEARS DIDNT BUY IT BUT HAD THE LP THAT WAS GOOD WELL ANOTHER NOT SO ''HOT PRODUCTION IF THERE BOOTGEL ''HOT PRODUCTION'' BETTER WAKE-UP AND GET DANEING AND FIX THE PROBLEM !....

HEY YOU DIDNT I TELL YOU NOT TO BUY THIS AND THOSE OTHER SUCK-IE CD WELL YOU'LL LISTEN AND BELIEVE ME NEXT TIME WONT YOU SHAKE YOUR HEAD YES THERE YOU GO THAT'S WHY YOUR READING MINE YOU KNOW I GIVE IT TOO YOU REAL !
5,Great book for Ideal collectors!,"Excellent book, tells the whole history of Ideal dolls. Many, many photos. Ideal had a lot of very popular dolls. Shirley Temple, Toni, Miss Revlon, Saucy Walker, Crissy, they are all in there and many more you probably have forgotten about.You will love this book!"
4,Collectors Guide to Ideal Dolls Identification and Values: Identification and Values,There are many pictures of the more popular dolls that you can match to your doll for a short description and identification. I did like the inclusion of manufactured and/or patent year and the original price on some of the entries. The description of the dolls that I was interested in was not complete and the pictures didn't show the markings or identifying features.
1,Unclear,With a picture of full plastics it is easy to misunderstand the fact that you are buying one part only.
2,Beautiful book with British bias,"This is a beautifully produced reference book with extensive color photos. Its size gives it the illusion of being comprehensive. However, it only includes plants that will grow ""somewhere in the British Isles"". It omits a number of species which are U.S. natives (e.g., no Rhododendron catawbiensis, although the author offers a whole section on Asian rhododendrons). It also misses species cultivated in the Southern US (e.g., no gardenias). List of cultivars circa 1989 is getting dated. I would also hope that the next edition would alphabetize the order in which species are presented within the sections. If you don't mind its limitations, it's a bargain; buy it for the photos."
3,Thermalarm III ?,"It is possible that the Thermalarm III is the one that goes up over 110 degrees. This one only goes up to about 100 degrees, per the photo. We need the higher temperature for summer."
4,There should be more by these two!,"The first of only two albums by this female duo, ""Hai Ku"" is some of the most interesting and pleasing of the progressive country/pop genre. I bought it after hearing ""Love Like This"" on TV, and it is one of my most-played CD's. Two beautiful voices which work very well together, and effective, imaginative instrumental backup. The theme is mostly love, and there is lots of passion, heartache and joy here. This album and its sister, ""Walk the Line"" were out of print for a long time, and appear scarce now. Very highly recommended, and I hope I can get another copy, since mine is gone."
5,Track Listing,1. Hai Ku2. Love Like This3. Only Chain4. After Your Arms5. Faithful6. Cariation on a Theme in D Minor7. Western Fires8. Love Is the Healer9. Who's Gonna Hold You10. Born to Give My Love11. Nightline12. Leavin' Line
4,Little Known Talents,"I saw Rose and Kennedy with Emmylou Harris in concert in December. In addition to Rose and Kennedy, Emmylou had a fabulous bass player named David Jacques. Bothe ladies were fabulous musicians so I bought this album and have enjoyed it several times. It is a pick what you like and skip the others sort but still worth having."
1,"DON""T BUY IT!!!!!","My 10 year old son (Big Harry Potter Fan) baught this with his own hard earned money. Major dissapointment from the start! I just could not get it to run (Windows Me). I even recruited my computer Guru freind to help me figgure out the buggs. after 3 days of fruitless effort, we gave up. Tech Suport was no help, like the other reviewers, they just suggested to update drivers, my computers brand new, so that was no help. When I read the other reviews, I REALLY felt their pain. Nothing is more dissapointing than watching your childs bubble burst. Be prepaired for heatbreak this Christmas!"
2,Ok but you would have better luck with real legos,"I found that the game is extremely difficult and requires much tweaking. It is hard to master and even harder to run. It jams up all the time and the parts are hard to line up. I feel you should save your money, time, and just use your imagination, (...)"
1,Beware...Don't Buy It !!,"Beware...This product is defintely not worth the money. The package claims you can build rooms, make students interact, add special features to the castle, and lay down tracks for the Hogwarts Express.1. Building the rooms is tedious, frusterating, and time consuming2. Students and Teachers do not interact...they simply jump around3. You can only add certain feautures to certain areas4. The Challenges you can do to gain spells are boring and not well planned out.Difinitley NOT worth the time or money. A shameful addition to any Lego or Harry Potter Collection!!!!!!"
4,Excellent game. Windows XP/2000 owner,"I bought this game for my little ones and they love it. I would have given it 5 stars but I had a little trouble getting it to work on 2000/XP. I have both OS's. I contacted Tech support and they helped me get it to work on my 2000 machine.If you are having trouble getting it to work, call tech support. But if you have XP there is not much they can do to help.If you have 2000, try using a Power User account, or loggin in as Admin for your little ones. I simply log in as myself with admin access, and play the game with them. It's great fun."
1,HIDEOUS GAME for a Great Theme,"This product has two solid names behind it -- Lego and Harry Potter, and it SHOULD be a GREAT game.In fact, this is a game released on schedule, but before being finished. Its controls are contra-intuitive, clumsy, and v-e-r-y s-l-o-w. It locks up and freezes, some times coming back and executing your mouse click up to a minute after you've thought it didn't take, and have moved on. When it's running, it's sensitve and twitchy. Those who have said the controls are bad or frustrating are being quite kind. It takes hours to get the simplest things set up.Then, when you're finished, you can't actually DO much with your creations.Lego has a variety of software titles and should include good products; perhaps the second title, ""LEGO Creator: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" will be usable and fun."
3,Boring and no point in playing it,"This game is a little pointless and boring. All you do is watch lego Harry Potter people walk around, bump into things for hours, say ""ah"" and bow. This is not an adventure game. Sure, you can build stuff for the lego guys to walk into, but then what? Watch them all crowd around to get in it and then get stuck? Boring.There is a bug: the challenge movies freeze and won't work and the computer feaks out. :(The best thing(and funniest)thing that happened on this game was when my brother put a naked lego guy in a tiny cage and we watched him try to get out. You can also put hundreds of boats in the lake, trap ten thousand frogs in a 3""x 3"" fence and make Harry get stuck on the roof of the castle and watch him fall to his doom.But if you are insane about Harry Potter than this is for you."
1,A Game that Misfunctions,I just bought Lego Media Harry Potter (at a store) with my Christmas money and it always freezes when I come to the first menu. I can not play this game. And the stores do not take back opened computer games. I think I would like this game if it was working right.I think they just released this game because the movie came out. Lego doesn't care about us kids only about making money. They do not offer patches at the Lego site. No one is working to fix this.Next time I will look at all the reviews here at Amazon before I buy a game and order it at Amazon.de
2,Tread Lightly,"My 8 year old received this as a gift for Christmas. He was most excited about playing the game until he actually got into it. The interface is confusing, and the gameplay doesn't work right... You have been warned!"
3,Bad controls,"This game is actually pretty cool. However, be aware that it is an extreme challenge. The instructions are pretty bland. I find that the greatest challenge is moving around. Also, be aware at what this game is. You actually BUILD the Hogwarts interior, meaning the building is set up, but you have to place the furniture. Try to split your activities up, because constantly just placing furniture can get boring. It actually is a very cool game, but the controls bring the rating down ALOT. They are really confusing. It would have been better if lego had put a simple key bord movement-maybe even strafes. Having to controll a trax ball that is super sensative and page movements that you have to time or else you lose site completely can really start ticking you off. So, if you can figure controls out easily and get used to them quickly, this is the game for you. If not, then strongly reconsider this game."
1,Try again Lego (well maybe not),"Avoid this game. They did not get it right. First, I could not get it to work on XP. Oh, well. I should have looked more closely at the package. It makes no Windows claims. I did get it to work on Windows 98. But my 9-year old and I had a very slow go at figuring out how to make it work. The graphics are poor. Everything ran slow compared to our other games. (Working with 256MB memory, 32mb video memory, lots of free defragmented disk space.) The help is disfunctional much of the time and extremely slow the rest of the time. Too bad the Harry Potter enterprises did not contract with the Humongous crowd to do this. (Humongous are the makers of Pajama Sam, Freddy Fish, etc.)"
1,Don't Bother,"This might be a good game if I could ever play through it. After playing it for about 5 minutes, the computer freezes up and I have to restart."
4,So Cool!,"I love this game! Build Hermione in Diagon Alley, Ron in Gryffindor Common Room, Harry at the Sorting Hat, Most of the characters at Hogwarts! Great for any Harry Potter fan with a PC."
5,AKG will Rock Your World!,"I discovered this group because their song, ""Haruka Kanata"" was featured as the second opening for the anime Naruto. I immediately checked out their main album, Kunkei Five M, and was very surprised at how good they were. Houkai Amplifier was a mini-album released before Kunkei Five M, but has some excellent songs on it. The songs tend to be very fast paced and have excellent driving beats. I especially enjoyed ""Haruka Kanata"" (track 1), ""Compass"" (track 2), ""Ao no Uta"" (track 4), and ""12"" (track 6). Asian Kung-Fu Generation is your standard rock group, that is making a great name for itself. Some of their earlier works can be a little redundant, but the new stuff they are coming out with is excellent! I defintely suggest this mini-album as a small taste of AKG. If you really enjoy these songs, then I suggest looking at their album ""Kunkei Five M"", and their latest singles ""Loop and Loop"" and ""Rewrite""!"
3,works okay but,This product works okay but not sure that it has been all that helpful. I am still taking it but will look for a local source.
3,Wood CD/DVD Storage Spinner,"The above spinner was really hard to put together. More detailed instructions rather than just pictures would have helped. We had to really work with some pieces as they did not line up. If it wouldn't have been for my daughter's assistance, I would have given up and thrown it away.Once it was all complete it worked out great and I do get lots of compliments on it."
3,A general overview,"This is a game only for the car (Unless you get carsick.) it is very time consuming, and you should only rent it for long road trips.Also, contrary to what most say, there is a way to save. if you just turn it off while playing, the next time you start the game, you continue from where you were exactly."
4,A Mario-Party type game......,"This is really an okay game for the GBA, but the graphics could do a little tune-up. I like the Mario-Party type mini-games, though, & it is fun.So, overall, I give this game 4-Stars."
2,A biased view of the Spanish Conquest of the Americas,"This book does give an overview of the Spanish Conquest of the Americas, BUT it is told from definitely favorable view of the Spanish specifically a Spanish Catholic point of view.I have nothing against anyone beliefs. But this book glosses over most of the exploitation of the native tribes; by saying it was only a few minor problems. And the natives would have just settled down and become civilized good Catholics, there would not have been any problems.The saving grace of this book is the appendix material, lists of names, dates and a great bibliography."
3,Simple,"This was a decent factual account of the life of Mary Queen of Scots. It was to the point and simply written without going into any serious detail. I thought it was odd that before each paragraph was a sort of outline of what was going to be discussed in that paragraph..?? And the book almost read like a middleschool history text book at times. Either way, it kept me interested to the end which seemed to carry the most weight in the book. Can't beat it if its Free!"
4,Franklin's Valentine,This is a fun book to read to youngsters in kindergarten around Valentine's Day. This kids enjoy it!
5,Outstanding,This is an outstanding product. I was introduced to it by a friend from Arizona after many years of studying hot sauceses and trying out just about everything available - this has become my favorite.
3,Enjoyable Read,"It's been a long time since I've read a book normally considered 'juvenille' literature for my own pleasure. I've discovered that the only thing lacking is graphic sex and violence, and lets face it, how often does a good story really need that?I found this story well paced and its characters multi-layered and endearing. Dickinson has convinced me to delve further into the 'juvenille' genre."
2,Not very good read,"I disliked this book very much. The book has the potential for an interesting plot, but tends to be very boring and confusing. The author fails to use commas in a lot of places and sometimes loses your interest. I like to think that I am a good reader, and I read this book with two other people who also disliked this book. The author also over uses the words ""throng"" and ""grope."" The epilogue does not really end the book and left many untied ""ropes.""If you expect correct basic sentence mechanics, such as commas, do not read this book. If you don't like it when seemingly random words are used more than once or twice on a page, or if you like good books in general (twilight for example), do not read this book."
5,Dr. Langston shows sophistication in simplicity !!!!!!!,"I am currently a Business Education student at Chicago State University, and this book was assigned as part of the reading and application for one of my graduate courses. Dr. Langston's approach and writing ability makes it a great text and reference book. In the Chapter on Merging she gives step by step instruction on how to create documents using data fields and form letters. This word-processing function is one of the most difficult for a beginning word-processing student to grasp, but Dr. Langston makes learning it a breeze throughout the chapter. I highly recommend this book to people learning WordPerfect and teachers who are teaching this language to their class as part of their Business Education Program."
4,instant hot Quinoa,The product was great but the shipping cost were almost half as much as the product ' that is not acceptable enough for me to reorderthank you Mary b Lusinski
5,The most wonderful collection of illustrations by Sempe.,The most wonderful collection fo illustrations by Sempe
3,thin slab,"This band has done some great work,but unfotunately this album seems hurried and not well put together.Teir 89 album is a super disc and is almost above anything Skynard ever did.Thats the one I will suggest if you want a little thicker slab"
2,Disappointing,"As much as it pains me to say it, Raging Slab really fumbled the ball on ""Sing Monkey Sing."" The whole thing sounds like a blatant contractual obligation move, with murky production and distressingly tuneless, unfocused songs that go nowhere. Aside from a semi-catchy riff on the opening track ""Shoulda Known,"" there's nary a memorable moment on the remainder of the CD. This is a band that can really tear it up live and most of their other releases are first-rate. Avoid this sludgy mess and go for ""Dynamite Monster Boogie Concert,"" ""The Dealer,"" or their self-titled debut instead."
2,should have been bound in lead,"If V.S. Naipul thought Henry James was the worst writer in the world, it's only because he hadn't read Pybus, who in this diligent aggregation at least lives up to his name. Some might say that there is a haptic sensation of arrogance in how poetry is abused here. The majority of readers might also hope that Pybus had buried these odes in cement or only preserved them as marginalia in great dusty tomes and the kind of heavily footnoted journal articles used to torture graduate students, accessible only to the library-bound and the savage and compromised inheritors of a ruined civilization. My reaction was that the book should have been bound in lead shielding to await that great day."
5,The Road To Oz,"NOTE: This is not the edition of the book I would have liked to review. I just didn't see it anywhere. This review is based on the Del Rey edition.The Road To Oz is the 5th book in the Wizard of Oz series.In this book, Dorothy again visits Oz. She also meets new characters such as the Shaggy Man, Polychrome-the daughter of the rainbow, and Button Bright. Their main goal: to get to Emerald City for Ozma's birthday party.---Now, I think it's time to tell who Ozma is. If you read The Land of Oz, you would know that Tip is Ozma and Ozma is Tip. Ozma is a princess and ruler of the Emerald City.Along the way to the Emerald City, Dorothy and the rest of the group met King Dox the fox, the Musicker, and the Scoodlers, plus many more.This is one of the best in the series. I would highly suggest this book to anyone who loves to read and loves fun!"
4,Fun read for little ones.,"Frank Baum writes for young readers. There is always enough danger and suspense to keep them interested. In this book Baum introduces ""the shaggy man"" (who has no name). He and Dorothy leave Kansas for and wild walk through the lands bordering Oz, arriving just in time for Ozma's birthday party. Get it for your kids, read it for the child in you."
2,Little plot,"While I have enjoyed reading the Oz books to my kids, this was our least favorite. Dorothy ends up trying to get to Oz in time for Ozma's birthday. She meets a few new characters who are not that interesting along the way. The climax of the book is Ozma's birthday party which is long winded and descriptive but with little excitement to it. The only value of this book is the introduction of the Shaggy Man. But you could easily miss it out without harm and skip on to Emerald City of Oz which is far more exciting!In addition, there are no colour pictures in the Books of Wonder edition. Instead they print sections of the book on different colours of paper. The colours change halfway through a chapter at times and make no sense. Some are rather dark and make the ink drawings more difficult to see."
3,Too Scary!,"Modest fun for the whole family, but there are a lot of heffalumps and woozles chasing Piglet, to the tune of somber music. Our five year old runs out of the room every time! Quite a bit too scary for the pre-school audience."
1,Money Wasted,My kids are not at ALL interested in this game. I would not buy if I had it to do again.
2,New Updated Shortcuts Online,"This book is woefully out of date -- There is a new online forum for Los Angeles area shortcuts at www.trafficdocumentary.com, FYI!"
2,"It was good 11 years ago, but a new edition is needed","L.A.'s streets and freeways have changed a lot since this book was published, and some of the routes have disappeared, while others have become more crowded than the areas it tries to avoid. Still, it's better than a kick in the arse."
3,"Good cable, terrible durability","I owned this cable for its entire lifespan, which was just about a year. When I first purchased it, the splitter worked flawlessly and had no problems with audio quality whatsoever. As time went on, however, the cable began to lose its stereo-sound ability and eventually went fully-mono. It is quite annoying to listen to only mono in headphones in my opinion, and I was sorely disappointed that these didn't last a bit longer."
4,Not quite 3 Feet but works,"To be clear, this splits the audio signals into two. That is, it plays the same things on both ports. Perfect for sharing music or in my case, recording stuff thats playing while listening to it at the same time. This will NOT seperate the right and left channels. Feels a little flimsy but for the price its really expected. Does what it says and thats all i ask."
4,Great for the price,"This has worked just fine for me. It sometimes requires some finesse to get both ear pieces to pick up just right, but that may be more of an issue with my headphones than the product."
2,Almost the same as Vol. 2!!,"I purchased both volumes and was very disappointed to realize that Vol.2 was +90% the SAME as Vol.1. I was able to use many of the things shown in my practices - so the DVD was not ""BAD"" - but I wish I only bought one!"
2,Tame Book,"I got interested in this book because I remembered reading a children's book, Flossie and Bossie, that she had wrote. I had no idea Eva Le Gallienne was a famous theater actress, director etcc... I read this and her other autobiography, and you get absolutly no idea of her real personal life. She mentions she is not going to give up any dirt basically. But because of the times or whatever, you can't even tell she is a lesbian in this book, or any of her problems with alcohol or problems with her half sister... and just tons of stuff about her that I am currently finding out while I am reading a biography of her. The biograpies give you the dirt and are a lot more interesting.."
3,Abundance of theorems and math...basic explanations only...,"This book is filled with formula's and theorems. However, one must have a basic understanding of all the formulas and theorems in order to understand most of them. If you love math and enjoy seeing how formulas and theorems are worked out this is an excellent book. Even though it is extremely thick. I had hoped they would explain in much more detail the order of operations. Other than that, it is a well put together reference book."
5,Stockman Gets Real with Parents,"This book covers all aspects of emotional behavior associated with grown children who, for whatever reason, have difficulty acting grown up. No parent is perfect, but Stockman gets you past the guilt (Where did I go wrong?) and moves you toward problem-solving.This book gives you the strength to appreciate your children and have an adult relationship with them. He gives clear analysis to many of the reasons why some adult children don't grow up, and ways to be pro-active instead of reacting.This one is a keeper."
2,COLETTE DURING HER TRIBAL/INDUSTRIAL HOUSE PHASE...,"... although she's rather cute, Colette's singing voice at this stage was rather whiny-sounding and hardly pleasing to listen to - she just doesn't have the pipes to attempt diva-type vocals... however, her more recent material, especially the 2-disc set with DJ Heather, is quite impressive and far better than this recording."
4,An elementary introduction to directed sets.,"This book presents the unification of the many versions of limit processes (sequences, series, approaching infinity, approaching a point, integration, etc.) under the more general concept of directed sets. The applications comprise only functions from directed sets into the real line. The terms 'net' and 'generalized sequence' are never mentioned. The concept of subnet is not introduced."
4,A good map - but no subtitles in Thai.,"In my list, this is the second best map of Thailand that I've come across. The main reason for this status is the durability of the map and its colorful nature: this map is laminated and therefore is waterproof, draw-able (you can mark your route on the map and wipe it off at will), hard to be torn apart and its colors are vivid and make it very nice to look at. Aside from that, it's very nice to handle thanks to its scale of 1:1,750,000. You will also find a Bangkok 1:100,000-scale map that will not be of use due to its small size and under detailed nature (dont worry, as you'll get a free copy at the airport).On the other hand, nothing compensates for the fact that there are no Thai subtitles for the names of the places side by side to the English names, especially in a country where so many locals don't speak or read English. For that reason, the Michelin Map (check out my review) is the best choice."
3,Buy his other CDs,"I love Boubacar, but this CD was disappointing. Most of the best songs on the CD I already have from his other CDs and those recordings are better. This one has a lot of noise from the movie that I could do without.I HIGHLY recommend getting Karkar's other CDs: 'Sa Golo' and 'Macire'.The DVD sounds great based on comments from the other reviewers - I would love to get a copy of that!"
5,Great Music from Mali!,"The album is great! Boubacar Traore is playing and signing with so strong emotions that you feel yourself to be in Timbuktu.There are other famous musicians playing with him in this album, like Ali Farka Toure.This is one of the best albums of a Malian that I listened to."
4,"very cute book, says what i wanted it to say","my daughter is still not potty trained but i think if anything has helped book/toy-wise, it was this one, it's gentle and instructive, though not explicit."
4,My Big Girl Potty,It was very cute. I bought a lot of different potty books to use on potty training day. My daughter liked it and it killed time while we were sitting.
2,Too complex,"Too much of a story going on here. Too many words, and since we use the toilet and not a separate potty seat, my daughter gets confused. Also doesn't know why the bunny goes on the potty seat. They story kept going on after I thought the story should have ended, so it can be inconvenient when you want to have the little one go fast."
5,A Nice Addition To Your Potty Book Collection,"This is one of many books I bought about potty training. I have to say I like this book. Ashley is just adorable. Both parents are involved in the training process (I'm the one who did the training in our family but I like the fact that it says to kids that dads can do it too). I also like that it wasn't instant success for Ashley. She tries twice to sit on the potty with no sucess and does have an accident. When she finally gets the hang of pottying, as a reward, she goes out with her parents and gets to pick out her own big girl underwear. I think this helped my daughter because I told her if potty training went well, I would buy her special underwear too, and not just any underwear--DORA underwear. I think that was a huge incentive for her and this book planted the seed.This is not my daughter's favorite book, but she likes listening to it and I like reading it. I recommend it to any young trainee and their parents."
4,Great Resource,"I purchased this book for my daughter to help in potty training her. Even though she likes 'The Potty Book - For Girls' by Alyssa Satin Capucilli better, she enjoys this book as well. Showing all the stages of potty training including showing Ashley sitting on the potty w/ her clothes on, then removing her diaper, accidents and finally, 'big girl' underwear, it helps little ones to understand the concept of 'going' on the potty. I gave this book 4 stars only in that it's a little more 'wordy' than 'The Potty Book - For Girls' and isn't as colorful but I do recommend it to anyone."
5,a great book for potty training!,"My 26-month-old daughter enjoys reading this book. She especially likes that Ashley has a bunny, since my daughter is very fond of bunnies! I think this book is well-written and has helped my daughter with her potty training. Definitely worth the money!"
3,natural relaxant,this product o.k. for sleep.......did little for my upper back which is in constant knots
4,A Great Substutue for Harsh Meds.,"I have a back injury and take muscle relaxers to help - the usually do me in for over a day - I found Leg Cramps, Muscles Cramps and decided to give them a try. They work the same for me as my prescription meds. without the harsh side effects. I can take two before bed and be able to function the next day, unlike with my regular meds.My husband even uses them when he has been using muscles that he normally does not use."
2,"Better Than Nothing, I Suppose","There's joy indeed in hearing such obscure film melodies as ""Hollywood Party"" and ""My Bluebird Is Singing the Blues"" outside of their celluloid realm, yet I can't help but remain somewhat wistful over the treatment given here. If Miss Klein had opted to sing through her throat, instead of her nose, the results might not only have been happier, but more authentic to the period. I'll never understand the prevalent queer notion that any song from the 20's and 30's requires an imitation of Betty Boop to put it over. Certainly, this affectation was not present in the original recordings. As it is, if you're especially fond of the Broadway revival of ""42ND STREET"" you'll go for this in a big way. If you're a vintage musical fan, though, this is best avoided. On a positive note, the arrangements and musical accompaniment are delightful... but the vocalist is little more than a parody of a 1950's parody of a 1920's/30's vocalist. Pity."
2,Janet Klein,"Janet Klein provides an important archive of songs, most of which have been passed over. The CD design is brilliant. The unfortunate part is that she cannot carry a tune. I am a singer and director of musical events, and a great lover of music of all kinds. Never have I heard or purchased a CD on which the artist had such poor pitch. (And I don't include Florence Foster Jenkins.)"
2,Disapointing,"The 'Freaking Sweet Party Pack' DVD / Game collection came with two packs of playing cards. But upon inspection, they were standard playing cards without pictures of the Family Guy cast. I bought this set seeing that it had pictures. Unfortunatly the pictures are limited to the face cards and are primarily of Peter, Brian and Stewie. (And one odd duck of Chris.) No Lois, Meg or any other characters. The 'Pawtucket Patriot' can container was a nice touch, however."
4,ROMAN ARC,"BOUGHT IT A COUPLE OF YRS AGO AND IT HAS BEEN A QUALITY PRODUCT. I POLYURETHANED THE WHOLE THING BEFORE ASSEMBLY, TERMITES ARE THICK HERE; AND HAVENT HAD A PROBLEM"
4,Tag Heuer Chronograph,"A fine watch. It has met 95% of my expectations; the shortcomings being that the face is not brightly luminescent, but adequate.Purchase and delivery were flawless."
5,one head at a time...,I first purchased this toothbrush at my local health food store but I can't find the soft refill heads anywhere local so I checked amazon and lo-and-behold they have 'em. Now I can continue saving the world one toothbrush at a time ;). The heads are a piece of cake to put in and take out and I can feel better about changing out my toothbrush regularly.
1,Aaaaaaaaargh !!! - I never write reviews but.....,"If you like Normal Ska / Punk or Metal and are NOT a Christian - you are VERY UNLIKELY to like this band.I am not slating christians or their music - I was raised as a christian and made to go to Church until I was like 14 but I cant stand this music.For quality SkaPunk - stick to Operation Ivy, Mad Caddies, Catch 22, reel big fish, less than jake, mustard plug, save ferris, sublime ....etc.Aaaaargh."
3,Solid album that is more disco than soul...,"The title track is a very sensous and romantic ballad that has ""Classic"" written all over but all the other songs are disco numbers. While the production on all tracks is very slick, one can't help but wonder why more ballads were not included (remember that Blue Magic is in the same league as The Stylistics, Delfonics, Dramatics and Chi-Lites as far as soul harmony vocal groups go)."
2,Not quite the same,"I bought this CD thinking it was an LP from 1974 (because of the ""Classics Back On Wax"" tag line). I love ""Welcome To the Club,"" which appears here (although it's not the hit version), and thought the other songs would be of similar vintage. But every song on this CD is a wan, underpowered late '70s disco tune (lots of syndrums). None of the cuts have that wonderfully rich, orchestral Philly Sound. Even the vocals seem lackluster--they might as well have been recorded in someone's basement, or in the lounge at a Holiday Inn. A big disappointment and a sad comedown for the normally excellent men in Blue Magic."
3,Haven't I seen you before? Yes!,"Made in GER in 1999, Serial# 20-4022-MI, Playing Time 95:38This 2-disc collection showcases Jon Anderson, Peter Banks, Bill Bruford, Tony Kaye and Chris Squire during various radio broadcasts back in 1969 and 1970. Considering these tracks were typically recorded ""live in the studio"", the performances and arrangements are excellent.This album has also been issued under the names ""Beyond And Before - The BBC Recordings 1969-1970"" in the USA, ""Yes BBC Sessions 1969-1970 - Something's Coming"" in Japan, as well as ""Something's Coming - The BBC Recordings 1969-1970"" in the UK.If you don't have any of those, I would suggest your best investment is with either the US version or better yet, the UK pressing: you'll get a booklet with liner notes written by Peter Banks back in 1997, along with some interesting newspaper clippings. This german pressing has no photos, no liner notes..."
5,Just as described!,This case came in great condition-shiny and black with 10 spaces for watches. They fit big Fossil size watches. Great buy!
5,New Awareness,"This book brought a new awareness to me. Women. At the last supper? I had never considered this concept before; however, what a natural phenomenon it would be for women to be present, as they were at the events surrounding the ressurection. Millie has enlightened me about a group of women close to Jesus.Her style is engaging, her research is impressive, and the book offers a multiplicity for use--on a personal basis, as a group study, or, each essay stands on its own as an individual piece. What a powerful message for any season, but certainly pertinent during Lent."
3,Audio verson suffers from abridgement,"Much of the time, the audio version of this book held me it its thrall. The reader is excellent at setting tone and creating character. But the story is abridged far to much for the mystery and its solution to make any sense, coming entirely out of left field and leaving the listener feeling cheated. This is one book that I would want to actually read cover to cover rather than listen to all chopped up. The audiobook promises more than it can deliver."
3,Dunning finally disappointed me,"Dunning is one of the top writers in the mystery genre and I wish he would publish more often. But this disappointed me.I have little interest in old books, but I loved the Cliff Janeway tomes. I have a little more interest in old-time radio, but I couldn't get into this, perhaps because of the rambling writing sytle, perhaps because of the large assemblage of characters. I found myself going back to doublecheck. When I do that, it means my attention has lapsed."
2,At Least Some of the Radio Stuff was Interesting,"First, I am, or was, a fan of John Dunning. This book was a major disappointment.When a person is playing tennis or squash, the worst thing he can do is think of two shots at once. Invariably, he tries both at once and loses the point. This is what Dunning did in this too long novel. It is a novel about radio and a mystery novel. In trying both ""shots"" at once, Dunning loses the point in a big way. He should have chosen either and stuck with it. The mystery never convincingly wove into the radio novel.In Dunning's other works, he successfully uses his intimate knowledge of bookselling and journalism to enhance the mystery. Here his radio marathon smothered a tenuous mystery plot. Read his earlier novels, but skip this one for sure."
4,a film noire book about radio,"I will be amazed if someone doesn't make a movie out of this book, especially given the renewed interest in World War II. It's almost impossible to read and not see the scenes come to life before you - usually in black and white with Bogey as Jack and Bacall as Holly. Both the mystery of why people at radio station WHAR keep disappearing and the story of the station itself are enough to keep one up turning pages way past midnight. The one major drawback is that this is a tale of 1940s America written with a little too much late 20th century sensitivity. These average Joes in summer 1942 seem to know way too much about what's going on in Nazi concentration camps and are extremely liberal in their views of race relations and gender equality. While noble, it distracts from the seemingly realistic portrayal of the Golden Age of Radio."
3,Not the bookman series,good book and well written but not as good as the bookman series in my opinion
4,Interesting History - Somewhat Contrived Mystery,"Any lover of old-time radio can find plenty to enjoy in Two O'Clock, as the story reeks of period detail and interesting geeky background of the era. Still, unlike Dunning's Bookman series, I had trouble with the verisimilitude in this story, which had to work hard to maintain the connection to the stories of the radio people and still keep the mystery alive.Nonetheless, recommended."
2,Where was the edtior?!?,"I have been a fan of Mr. Dunning since his first book ""Tune into Yesterday"" came out in the 70s. The two ""Book"" volumes were marvelous reads and fueled my hopes that ""2:00"" would be a captivating read. And it was, at least when Mr. Dunning concerned himself with the radio station. As for the mystery segments...well, it's a mystery to me why his editor allowed the book to go to press with far too many characters that blend together, a plot that often made no sense, a killer who the reader wasn't even sure he/she knew, and a bizarre tie-in to the Boer War, Nazis, and the IRA. Not to mention a vast expanse of dunes and ghost towns that always seemed to be in walking distance of the radio station. Shame that all this book needed was some reality slaps from a good edtior to make it great. I'm sure Mr. Dunning will return to form next round."
2,False Advertising,"This is just not a thriller. Yeah, yeah, I know there's a mystery here, but it's not a good one. It fails on several levels: you don't care enough about the dead man to worry about how and why he was bumped off, and the ending is far too contrived to be credible. Finally, Dunning is far too fond of his other true loves (radio and horses) and tells us way more than we need to know about the mechanics of either to advance the plot.Having said all those good things, now let me proffer some deserved praise. As a purely historical novel about American life in the years before and into early WWII, the book works nicely. Dunning provides a vivid glimpse of a world now many years removed, when radio (not tv or the internet) was the mass medium, when American men in the millions took to the road because it was the only way they could support themselves, and when the fear of foreign invasion was all too real.It's not what it promises to be, but it was a pleasant minor historical read."
4,Can't wait to start!,I just finished reading through this book and i cant wait to get started.I really love the check list in the back so we can't forget anything we need to get started.The only thing that i do not like is every picture has been drawn.We would love to have some real color pictures to look at.
4,Just Dancehall,"When I first listned to this album i was a lttle disappointed because I was used to the ""log on"" sound but this is more party music. but the 2nd time I was listening to it it immediatly grew on me it definnatly makes u wanna dance even I wanted 2 dance and I hate dancing. This album has a much happier feel to it there's no gay-bashing or annything like that, not that i have a problem with that or sum this is just real party music but i have 2 say LOG ON is better.But Anyway if ur a dancehall fan GET THIS!Tracklist1 Party like this feat Jagwa2 Nuh come fast3 Elephant message4 Ho hail me5 Give her it good6 Do yuh thing7 Run for your life feat Jarvis Church8 Egyptian dance9 Krazy10 Bad Man a Bad Man11 Low mi name (passa passa)12 Making money13 Bring di sittin come14 Bumper15 Higher level16 Tall up Tall up17 Ghetto girls18 Approach19 Gotcha feat Jagwa20 Look21 On line22 Virginity23 Miss matty son"
1,the price is too high,I'm a long time fan of fantasy. I appreciate Jordan and most recently George R.R. Martiin. After reading the positive reviews I was very disappointed with this book. I generally criticize authors when they put in too much description but this book was just the opposite: it was like reading a Cliff Notes of a gigantic fantasy novel. Needless to say it was a great story-severely hampered by poor writing. I don't usually have a problem with profanity but it's use in this novel seemed gratutitous given the lack of adult depth in any of the characters.Sadly I cannot recommend this book at all. It was a waste of time.
1,do not waste your time,"The prelude to this story seemed fascinating--until I startedreading the rest of the book. I threw it down after page 50. Although I admired Mr. Whitlock's concept of a sword and its control over the main character, I felt the story lacked the quality and style of writing which would allow some kind of cohesiveness and flow to a story.I would recommend you read Robin Hobb's Farseer trilogy to seewhat I mean in terms of reading a story that just ""flows"" andsinks its teeth in your imagination!"
1,Utter Tripe and Drivel,"If on a VERY boring day, you happen to walk by and see this book -- RUN, POKE YOUR EYES OUT, SET YOUR HAIR ON FIRE. It doesn't really matter which of these you do (or all of them) but under any circumstances DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!! Nononononono! DO NOT!Good God! By the time I got to page 10, (gnashing teeth and groaning due to the HORRIBLE editing and grammar)my brain had had enough, my eyes were refusing to see, and my teeth were of a mind to turn around in my mouth and start eating my head from the inside out."
5,A great Stroy!,"A great sroy.all ages will get a kick out of this. It's fast paced and full of action. you learn to care for the characters, even the bad ones.I recommend it highly!Chad"
5,A great Story for all ages.,"I feel in love with this book. I thought it was really well written. Every time I read it I can't put it down, and I find out something new. It has everything a good book should have it makes me cry and smile at the same time! I feel like im there with Drake and Mista. I recommend that you buy this book."
1,yawn...highschool comp101,"boring...an unoriginal rehashing of Highlander, Spawn, etc. it was so bad i threw it out b4 even making it to the end. oh and the author might want to fire his editors. gawd! what [junk]! if i was grading it as a teacher the book would be one big red blot of misspellings, incorrect grammar, and the like. ""thrown"" for ""throne"" is one such. while not quite as horrible as ""violin"" by anne rice it stinks almost as bad."
1,Never should have been published,"Trust me, the bad reviews above are correct - this book never should have been printed. If it at least had been edited, and the grammatical mistakes fixed, it may have been entertaining enough for a 12 year old, but even then, I have my doubts.Do not buy this book unless you're an English teacher and want a good example of bad grammar and editing."
2,This is not Beethoven,"I must say that the Diabelli Variations are quite well played... but the Bagatelles Op.126, one of the highest and sweetest of Beethoven's works are incredibly badly executed. The fastest ones, extremely fast, and the others without the acurate expression. Many people possibly disagree with me, but if they wonder ""what am I looking for"", simply listen to the same bagatelles played by Andor Foldes, Murray Perahia, Jeno Jand?, Alfred Brendel and others. I think the difference is broad."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ???,"I DON'T KNOW WHO THE CLOWN IS THAT IS IN CHARGE OF THE RECORDING RELEASE OF MICHAEL BUBLE, BUT THE MUSIC PUBLIC IS GOING TO REBEL AGAINST THE PROCESS HE SEMS TO BE USING . THIS LATEST RELEASE ARE SONGS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AND RELEASED . I THINK HIS VOICE AND PRESENTATION IS TERRIFIC , BUT ALONG WITH HIS OTHER RELEASES(INCLUDING THE CHRISTMAS ALBUM OF 4 OR 5 SONGS THAT AMAZON SAID""NOT AVAILABLE TILL DEC. 24"" THIS IS A JOKE) I HEARD HIS FIRST RELEASE AND IT WAS GREAT . HIS SECOND( WAS APOLOGIZED FOR BY M.B.) WE SAW HIM IN PERSON AT THE KING CENTER IN MELBOURNE , FLORIDA. THIS IS A GREAT TALENT GONE AWRY BY HIS HANDLERS .J.L.MURRAY"
3,Donna,"Again, this is the case of the author running out of ideas or to many ideas that don't come across to the reader. This third installment was the worse out of the three, I would recommend reading it only because I read the first two. The plot becomes to unbelivable, I know this is fantasy but you have to draw the line somewhere, in other words it has to make sense. The ending was too nice and neat I dont' want to spoil it for anyone but I was a little disappointed because the first two were much more interesting!!"
2,Died after 6 weeks of use!,"Received pump after about a week. Worked well out of the box with great water volume, but quit working after only 6 weeks of operation. Took cover off and made sure nothing was lodged in impellor, but still non-functional. Was hoping it would last a bit longer. Hope the warranty will relpace it."
1,Never Buy From These People!!!!!!,"A month has gone by, no product, they don't answer emails, they don't answer the phone, is there something wrong here?"
1,fishmate 800 pond pump warranty,"Warranty is a "" Rip Off "" ,less than one year ""prop"" worn out ,and I cleaned once a month ! Fishmate internet business said it was not responsible for 3yr. warranty .Company said ship whole pump at... My Expense,they would ""look at it ,no promise ,also noted I should buy repair kit once a year ($43.00)as routine maintenance !I repeat fishmate 800 pump,warranty, and company is a RIP OFF !!!!and yes I bought repair kit ..no choice !"
3,Mixed reesults,Mixed results. Used these pumps for several years with no problem. The last one lasted less than a year. Will try again because they were very good for me in the past.
2,This pump can't keep up,"This pump only gets 2 stars because it makes a very noticeable humming/vibrating sound and the flow is not as strong as I'd hoped after the filter was attached.The filter is the Pressurized Bio UV Pond Filter - 2000 gallon which has been great. I've struggled to keep my 1,300 gallon pond algy free and clear since it gets a lot of direct sun light and has 6-12 gold fish (depending on the last visit from the racoons). In two weeks this filter made crystal clear the pond that was slightly clearer than fat free milk."
2,"IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ORIGINAL THOUGHT, KEEP LOOKING.","Carlson started his writing career as an editor, then as a solicitor. He got leading self-help authors to contribute articles to form books. The only difference is that he now paraphrases good advice instead of quoting. He then pacakages it into his consistant 100 fragmented-pieces format, with no glue or system to make them stick in a person's life. His books are merely lame survey reports on other peoples' work. Even his title is a rip off. He is the new king of self-help junk food. He's the one not worrying and making money. . . off of readers looking for quick-fix, warm-and-fuzzy (but hollow) advice on success. The real contents of the book should be how he found a book-writing system to get rich via empty cleverness. The only good things in his books are from the original thoughts of others, thus the 2 stars instead of none."
2,"Read the ""Don't sweat"" series, skip this one","This book does not provide the insight and sound advice that I loved on ""Don't sweat the small stuff"" series. It doesn't provide much guidance, so, for money management tips and techniques, look somewhere else."
3,Mediocre,I don't think I finished reading this book. It seemed like the same ol' same ol' chicken soup stuff. I found nothing new in the half of it that I read.
1,"if you are stupid, you will appreciate this book, otherwise","I gave Don't sweat the small stuff 5 stars but this book seemed forced. Like the author was trying to meet a deadline and hence filled a book with junk. I could have written this, damn, why didn't I? I am sorry I spent any money on it."
1,Invest your money elsewhere,"Superficial and trite, not to mention disorganized. Spend your money on a couple of good investment guides instead."
3,Essays and reflections on the process of making money,"I bought my copy in an used bookshop in Surfers Paradise, Australia.. decided to take back home because of the honest, down to earth advice that some pages exhibit.I have forund it to be valuable as frequent reading, one chapter at a time and in a random order.. its my opinion the book will be much more valuable if you have already started your process of committment to making money. By that, I mean your inner process, its the part of thinking that creates the path to action (that you must take).Do it frequently, there is seldom time to talk to a friend who can advice you like this book."
5,Great observations re: the power of letting go of your fears,"Simply put, quick read and thoughtful insight into roadblocks we create in our lives. Carlson shows how to get fear out of your way to accomplish anything. Fun reading!"
3,Inside Madoff's head,"Although written in the 1960s, and covering a period between 1900-ish and the 1930s, reading this book allowed me to imagine I was in Bernie Madoff's head, learning why he did what he did.Mr. Auchincloss has an elegant writing style I enjoy, using a sentence structure that sometimes makes me pause to re-read, to make sure I've understood his meaning correctly.This is a good read. The topics covered - Wall Street, intrigue, love, deceit, manipulation - remain timely.If I were going to quibble, it would be on behalf of the character, Lucy (Rex's wife). Although she was intellectually and emotionally strong, intelligent, insightful, and loving, the author really did her wrong by allowing the main characters to universally dismiss her as ""poor creature."""
4,My Dad Enjoyed this,I bought this for my father so I cant really comment personally but as an avid reader of historical navel/war fiction he assured me he really enjoyed it and has requested more of the same. Thanks to the internet I am able to find new authors for him regularly.
5,bangin n.o.r.e.,"Bangin tracks from start to finish. Not one wack track on the whole cd. This cd is pure club,car and crib FIREEE..COP IT."
3,Some hot some not,"this is the first N.O.R.E. album i have ever bought so im new to his style. the track 'nothin' is the reason i picked this up, im a fan of just about anything the neptunes put out. Sayin that i think the only great tracks on this cd are the ones produced by the neptunes. 'nothin', 'grimey', and 'headbussa' are my top three tracks. the other 2 neptunes tracks are ok as well. as for the other songs, i didntlike them much at all. None of them flowed well. overall i think you would do better gettin those three tracks off the net, save your [money] and forget about the rest of the album."
1,Grimey?????,"Noreaga used to be an ill grimy MC with albums such as ""the War Report""(classic) and his first solo Lp. Noreaga always talks about how grimey he is, but all he does on this record is rap over jiggy Neptune beats in an attempt to make club songs. Doing cheesey songs with R&B singers and Ja Rule is about as un-grimy and commercial as it gets. Noreaga is a SELL-OUT. Save your money and buy CNN's War report, because this album is terrible."
4,Weak Production,"I am a big CNN fan so I picked this up as soon as it came out, but the production just doesn't help Noreaga out. Personally, I think Capone is the better MC of the two, but Nore is a good MC. But, he doesn't get very good production on several of the songs despite the fact that big names like The Neptunes, Swizz Beatz, Kyze, Irv Gotti, SPK, and LES do the production. There are still several good tracks, like Grimey, Nahmeanuheard, Mr Ceo, Love Ya Moms, Head Bussa, Banned from Another Club, and Nahmeanuheard Remix. The Life of A.. is a good song, but is just Capone. Live My Life and Black Clouds are both songs that grew on me-I didn't like them at first, but after a couple listens they are better. Capone makes the best guest spots, but Dwnlzy, Musaliny, Maze, Gold, Troy Outlaw, Ja Rule, Final Chapter, Cam'ron, Fat Joe, Complexions, and Cassidy all have good moments. Overall, it is better than Melvin Flynt, but still a cut below N.O.R.E. and well below the two CNN albums."
4,THE BEST YET,"GOD'S FAVORITE IS A TIGHT COMBINATION OF EAST AND WEST COAST ARTISTS.I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG FAN OF N.O.R.E, AND SINCE ITS BEEN A WHILE THAT HE HASNT DROPED A NEW HIT.THIS ALBUM REALLY MAKES UP FOR LOST TIME.EACH SONG HAS ITS OWN MEANING THATS WHAT I LIKE SO MUCH ABOUT IT AND ITS THE BEST ALBUM YET.I LOVE IT."
3,Nore is back it its okay but not wack,"Nore god favoriteI thought this ablum was rushed and he did not take his time on the ablum so it didn come out be like that good. But the production is alsome u got the neptunes Swizz gotti on the ablum so the beat are not wack that fo sho.the best song on the album is nahmeanyaheard and the remixnonthing, grimey, head bussa, the ceo, full mode,the end of ablum is pretty badI give it 3 stars for like 6 decent songs and the productionNOre take more time for your ablums Please.I suggest this to any rap fan"
4,Interesting Moral Choices,"This is my second Blackford Oakes novel and I found it, well, okay. As you might expect, a Buckley spy novel will be a little more cerebral than most others of the genre. On top of everything else Buckley does, he writes a pretty good, taut, spy novel. Just not a lot of action. The real story, it seems, is how Oakes wrestles with some tough moral dilemmas. Stained Glass will hold your interest but you probably won't be saying ""I couldn't put it down!"" Nevertheless, it's a worthy and entertaining book from an accomplished author."
3,Good value,I am a petite person so for me the stance is a little too wide for my comfort. Overall though it is a good value.
3,Christmas gift not loved...,"I got these for my husband for Christmas, as he is an avid ocean fisherman. He immediately noted that there were no lens caps, and therefore the binoculars would have to be handled with extra attention all the time - not really suitable for a boat. If lens caps matter, not the product you want."
3,and a 1/2 stars.,"The book's plot was extreme (but in this day and age, it didn't seem all THAT implausable.)The biggest fault I found was at the very end. I thought that the final pages of the book would have been better handled as some sort of ""author's epilogue."" To have the main characters sitting down and discussing the events in the manner that they did seemed completely strained and unnatural. They were having a conversation, but it seemed that they were reading from a transcript.It was a disappointing end to an otherwise good read."
1,Terrible,"This book was horrible. It was my first and last Robin Cook. Throughout the entire story, I wanted to yell at Laurie to keep her mouth shut... if she isn't blabbing to the doctor, she is blabbing to somebody else. And then she acts all surprised when she is reprimanded for divulging proprietary information. It would have been a better book if the mob guys had taken her out in the very beginning."
5,Another great CSI book from Cook,"I really liked the story; I should have listened or read it before the more recent books (Marker, etc) as the characters are developed in this one; enjoyed it emensely"
2,What happened to the real Robin Cook?,"This was the beginning of the end. Cook has always written engaging plots, even when retreading on similar territory, but with this book what little ability he had for writing believable dialogue was thrown out the window. His prose is filled with cliche, but what is worse is he puts them in the mouths of his charaters. The 2 mobsters sound as if Cook learned Italian mobster slang from watching the the Godfather translated into Chinese and then dubbed back into English. None of the characters dialogue has any subtext. They all say exactly what they think at any given moment, none of which sounds natural at all. Unfortunately, this trend seems to have continued with his later books. One must wonder if he is even writing them himself anymore."
5,Robin Cook's Blindsight: Excellent!,"From Robin Cook, one of todays best medical writers, comes a fantastic tale of mystery, and thrills that will send chills up your back! Blindsight was most certainly one of Cook's best!"
1,Quite possibly the worst book ever written,"This book is terrible. The only reason I read it was because it was in my mother-in-law's bathroom when we were visiting and I got sick and stuck in there. It was either this book or the backs of shampoo bottles. In hindsight, I should have stuck with the shampoo bottles. The only reason I gave this one star is because Amazon wouldn't let me give it zero. Terrible dialog and a completely unrealistic plot."
1,"Incredibly cliche ridden, ridiculous dialogue.",This book is a terrific example of bad writing. It is a gold mine of cliches and dialogue that is so bad it actually makes you laugh. The author should be embarrassed.
4,OK for a $100.00 camera,"I was a little disappointed with this camera. Being 5 mp I was expecting sharper pictures and better color resolution.The black & white pics were pretty darn good though. I found the battery compartment which also stores the memory card a bit troublesome. They should have placed the slot for the memory card somewhere other than in the same compartment that houses the batteries. The door is flimsy and if your not careful upon opening and closing to either replace the batteries or remove the storage card, this door will break quite easily.The video mode was fairly decent as it also records sound. The menu is very easy to master and the buttons on the camera are easy to access. All in all for a $100.00 camera it will do the job, unless....you want more professional looking photos."
2,Will Wipe Memory Card,"This is basically a digital point and shoot, but IT DELETED 250 PICTURES FROM MY MEMORY CARD WITHOUT WARNING, and I lost all of my pictures from a 2 month backpacking trip. Be careful, and do not insert a memory card that already has pictures on it, I think that is how they got deleted."
4,Almost complete. Very good.,"Very interesting, well written reading. The main problem is completeness: although some new topics are covered, other, more traditional, but fundamental, are not. One simple example: triggers."
1,Not a good buy,"We used this book for our graduate level course and the instructor(author) asked us to read the book. But there area lot of topics not well illustrated and explained. Some ideasare confusing or totally wrong.No need to mention so many typos. Chap 6 and Chap 7 are among the worst.Probably try another one ""Database Mgmt Systems"" by a UW Madison Professor. That one would be a lot better."
3,"Less a Complaint for the Book, more towards Amazon",I assumed since I bought the book new it would come with the access code for Myeducationlab. I was incorrect. If that was the case I would've have bought it elsewhere.
5,Fragrant!,I recieved a good amount of lavender for the price paid! It will last me awhile. I will order again.
5,Aromatic!,8 oz. is a big package. Smells great. Baking up a bunch of lavender white chocolate scones for the freezer. Tastes wonderful!
1,tastes like soap,"having an interest in edible flower's lead me to buy the cookbook "" The Lavender Cookbook"" and this product to make the recipes in tasting the lavender I found that it tastes a bit like rosemary and a lot like Soap."
5,Culinary Lavender,"Product was in good condition, packaged well and shipping/packaging was not overpriced. An added bonus, the store included a coupon for my next purchase. Sweet deal all around! THANKS!"
5,"Extremely Fragrant, Fresh, and Clean","I smelled this package from the mailbox outside of my house. When I first got my package, it was completely destroyed in the shipping. I immediately contacted customer service, they responded to me the SAME day (which is almost unheard of now a days), and they sent me a new package within the next couple of days. These people are so friendly, so nice, very understanding, and truly have a great attitude for business and their customers. I flavored powdered sugar with it to make Lavender Frosting (sifting the sugar of course, the buds are very potent). It's so aromatic, a little bit of lavender truly goes a LONG way! I have about 2 cups of lavender from purchasing the 4oz package. I highly recommend any product from the OliveNation company, they have great products and I'll be getting more! You get a coupon when you purchase anything, it's wonderful to put towards your next purchase!"
1,"Poor quality, full of stems, leaves and husks","I ordered this lavender to use in ice cream. Because of all the stems, leaves and husks I had to strain the ice cream after extracting the lavender flavor during the cooking. After spreading out two tablespoons and trying to just pick out the dried flowers, I gave up after realizing that the non-flower debris was about 1/3 of total."
1,"Great for close ups, poor on distance","I am an avid picture taker and I was so excited when I first got my Vivicam. But the more I used it, the more I disliked it. If you take a picture of a subject any more than 5 feet away, the pictures are all blurry and look out of focus. It really goes through batteries because it just runs off of 2 AA batteries, and if you use the flash you can probably only get about 12 pics before the batteries die. I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone."
3,More Tea than Salt,I gave this as a gift to my brother-in-law for Christmas. His comment was that it had a very strong green tea taste which over powered the sea saltiness.
1,awful!!!,"This one was a very strange one. The picture on the front of the DVD is a cute baby but the people singing are a group of kids from about 5-17 years old. Most are in long dresses or skirts and have scary face-paint on (think musician Kiss-style). Just overall weird. They sing nursery rhymes but the singing isn't synched with their voices and it is just kind of weird. There are also barney-type animals dancing around some of the time. On a positive note, my 2 year old actually liked it but I wouldn't sit through it again!!Don't waste your money!!!"
3,works,"Theres not really any other option here. These are hard to put on, it requires force from a hammer. I wish they were removable too."
1,I would have given it 0 stars if I could have,"I have never heard of these guys, nor have I heard this album. However, judging from the track listing, I can make a pretty good guess as to how badly this sucks. It's pretty telling that nobody else has left a review of this album either. It must not be worth the time. Hopefully the guys in this ""band"" are back in prison where they belong."
3,It Is Driving Me Crazy,"I think this motherboard works. It will absolutely not work right with PC3200 memory, but seems to work with PC2700. I have a 1.7 G Celeron with one 512MB stick from Fry's. I'm not sure if I have incompatible disk drives, unsupported combinations of IDE drives, or what. I get the weirdest boot errors trying Windows XP Pro, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2003. Finally I tried Windows ME, and it worked fine, but I couldn't run the stuff I wanted to run on that OS. Last attempt was Windows 2000 Server, but every time it booted up it gave a different error, mostly device drivers that failed to load. Now I am trying a WD400 40 G drive with XP Professional on the Primary IDE master and a CD burner on the Secondary IDE master to see if it will load, with no other hardware except a Ensoniq ES1371."
1,Save your money! -not that you were going to spend it anyway,"This CD is utterly inadequate for something that, according the the reviews thus far with the exception of one, is supposed to be ""highly anticipated"" and ""extremely original"". I just don't hear it. This is a relatively boring piece of amateurish music making covered with a load of self-promotion. I highly recommend saving your money for something worth hearing."
2,You get what you pay,"I got this set from Amazona and is ok for the price I paid for .The product description said reversible comforter , however this is not true, next the quality is not so good . it is bit thin .. and is not fully filled.. also there were lots of loose thread may be not fully finished had to cut them with a pair of scissor."
1,Messy Failure,"Concept-wise, the physics in the book is superficial, often fuzzy, sometimes plain wrong. (As a simultaneous example of the latter two, just read a paragraph allegedly explaining why atomic orbitals of the wrong symmetry do not contribute to a given molecular orbital. The author hardly knows simple group-theoretical explanation, so he provides nebulous metaphysical fertilizer instead). IMHO, the author merely does not understand physics well enough to help reader's understanding.References to nonexisting equations (e.g. Eq. 6.104 in Chapter 6), numerous numerical errors (e.g. to convert answer from Joules to calories, the author multiplies (rather than divides) by 4.2, ""typos"" like C(n,n)=0 instead of C(n,n)=1,and other types of sloppiness do not help either.I had much better luck with Nelson's""Biological Physics : Energy, Information, Life"" - much more instructive and insightful exposition, which reads like a strenuous hike over a beatiful terrain"
4,Very comprehensive; fundamental,"This book, while I haven't read it cover to cover, is a very good book which ties biochemistry down to the physics and upwards to fields like information theory. This book has a 2010 edition, but the basics of biochemistry haven't changed, and this edition seems to have a clear and concise way of presenting the material. This book doesn't necessarily replace an introduction to physics type book, but it draws together various fields into one, more or less, wholistic format."
2,It had promise,"Out of a slow year for really cool video games, Disciples' box cover offers promise, overhead strategy combined with rpg rules in a turn based setting. Not to mention four distinct races. Unfortunately the game is so painfully difficult, and not even fun that the tireless gamer must wait even longer for Blizzard to release Diablo II without anything to tide him/her by."
3,solid music for Brouwer fans,"As with all Naxos CDs if you happen to find music on it you don't care for you at least didn't lose a lot of money in the purchase and all the music on here is pretty decent. Personally I greatly prefer Shin-ichi Fukuda's performance of Hika but that CD seems hard to get. If you've already got the other Naxos CDs with Brouwer's music you should get this one. Devine's musicianship is good and the pieces are generally worth checking out, particularly Hika if you can't get Fukuda's recording, one of Brouwer's best works for solo guitar."
5,The source,"If you're looking for a great place to start learning about Relativity and physics in general, this is it. Even if your math skills have lost their luster it won't be a problem. I recommend reading this first, then if you're having trouble or don't understand a few points, read Einstein's Universe by Nigel Calder."
5,self-evident truths,Anyone with a mind not too cluttered with wishful thinking will find this book validating and sobering. Harris opens the door for further questions about what forces formed the human brain originally as well as whether there is really any reason to hope for anything other than the inevitable destruction of our environment(planet)... haunting in many respects.
4,a tasty book that may leave you with a craving for MEAT,Read it in my UT socialogy class in 92. Loved it then and am still referring to it. It's really a hands on look as some of the potential caused of the rise and fall of cetain cultural norms. It's a fun read!
1,disappointing,"probably the most annoying book i have read on the topic in a long time. christine has a crush on one of the subjects in the book and that makes for a boring read. the only good thing i can say about it is that some ' muggles' may find it of passing interest...but i seriously doubt if they would read the whole book. there are so many more in print that would satisfy your interest that are much,much better!if you are serious and have a certain intellectual capacity,please dont waste your time"
1,Ms Wicker just don't get it.......,"I really, really want to like Ms Wicker, her writing and the people she writes about. But I just can't.Ms Wicker has more psychic phenomena, spiritual lessons, and amazing, possibly life altering, magical experiences and manages to 'rationalize' them all. If she would only 'let go and let God' she could answer all the questions she asks.This is the second book of hers I've read, and they both have the same flaws. Ms Wicker manages to find some of the most bizarre personalities to define a lifestyle, and then with smarmy, mean descriptions, she managed to demean people in a very disillusioned way.To get to the point....if a psychic experience hit her over the head she would dismiss it, and for those who may also experience it, they are nuts. I'm done with her and her books."
4,Interesting Journey,"I love the premise of Wicker's book because I can relate to it. She also observes without judgement and incorporates humor without poking fun, which is refreshing. It's an interesting commentary on a often misunderstood topic."
5,Everything you want to know about Oda Nobunaga.,"If you're a student of Asian history or Japanese studies, you might consider reading this book. It's easy to read and I think it's a very complete description of the life of Oda Nobunaga and his deeds."
2,Fits but extremly tight,I have a 2002 Kawasaki 1100zxi and this cover was extremly tight on this machine. I guess it would be fine for winter or long term storage but for everyday use i wouldnt recomend.
4,The Roough Guide First Time Around the World 3rd Ed,"The book gave a very good overview on RTW travel. It made the travel idea and planning idea for me seem more real and that yes, i can do this EASILY.Buy it, it's worth reading and you can resell it on Amazon after you read it."
2,Soooo basic.,"I felt like this book was a compilation of short travel pamphlets on several subjects. A very extensive number of topics with a little blurb about each. There is absolutely no depth, and no real opinionated advice. It's all very ""you could do this, here are one or two reasons why, but you also could do this, and some reasons why, but for more information, look elsewhere."" It's more like a list of more-helpful websites, which I could have easily found myself on Google."
5,Lansky knows what he's talking about,"I recently attended a presentation by Doug Lansky, and was bowled over by his experiences and his extensive travel. (He's been to and had experience in and covered in reporting over a hundred countries!) He really has been in all the situations he advises on. Therefore, this guide is an accurate and realistic source for anyone traveling-- a must have! Lansky's tales are amazing! And his advice even better!"
4,Great all around guide,Very well written and organized. Has everything you need in a no-nonsense form. I highly recommend also getting Vagabonding by Rolf Potts to supplement this for inspiration.
2,For Beginners Only,Beginners Only:Good Book - for beginner travelers only. While looking at this book I didn't realize that it would go into such detail as to remembering to pack travel sizes or buying once you get there or remembering to look up Consulates in the country you are visiting.I guess I was looking for more out of the book in terms of actaully thinking/planning a trip around the world. Not the 101 of packing and traveling internationally.Would Recommend - not for experienced travelers though.
5,Very useful,"As someone who has done little travelling, and doesn't really know anybody that has, this book is very helpful.. I like that it discusses th unique challenges of planning a long haul, roud thr world trip. Most other guides only deal with a specific region, where this book is more generalized, but the info could be applied to just about anywhere in the world. Very well done!"
2,Disappointed,"First-Time Around the World is a book that is quite comprehensive in scope but less than comprehensive in detail. The author is obviously an experienced world traveler and quite qualified to write such a book, however, if you met with Doug Lansky for a couple of hours, you probably wouldn't be discussing most of the items contained in the first 200 pages of the book. This section could have been written by any travel writer or even lifted from another guidebook as it covers general travel information. The next 100 pages gives a very broad overview of eight sections of the world. There are many headings with one paragraph explanations of a generic nature. I hope that Doug Lansky eventually writes a book that gives the reader more of his expertise and specifically deals with around-the-world travel."
3,Better be young,"While there is a lot of interesting information in this guide, it is definitely geared to young people who plan to take a year or more to travel. I am not so young in age, tho young in spirit, so I didn't find it all that helpful. Also I was looking for ideas on how to undertake a round the world trip over several years, so again it didn't meet my needs. I generally have found Rough Guides very good, but this one was disappointing."
3,Not a huge difference on the first edition,"I did not find this edition much improved on the first edition. There's some great information if this is your first time coming to this book but it could have more detailed info, rather than adding a few bits more info here and there and calling it the second edition. Some of the information is not as up to date - it is possibly misleading - as it should be even allowing for a demanding publishing deadline. I would recommend getting your hands on a the first edition - it's probably doing the rounds in cheap books stores - and supplementing it with another travel book for more country specific info."
4,A very fun game for the Trek fan.,"I first picked this game up because I hadn't played a good Star Trek game for a while, and this was on sale. So even though it got mixed reviews, and I liked first person shooters better (like the Star Trek Voyager game) I picked it up and installed it. Right from the start I liked it. Voices from the TV shows, Brent Spiner returns as Data to guide you though the first mission so you know how to approach it, as well as intruguing new characters and ships all pull you into the game play. I like it and if your teeterting on buying it, just do it and enjoy the ride."
2,Stay Away Team,"Firstly, in common with Activision's previous Star Trek title, Elite Force, this is far too short for a full price game. The plot's none too poor, and has some pleasant twists that suprise, but the gameplay is repetitive and limited, so that by the end it has ceased to be a joy and more like a test of stamina. Of major concern is the lack of an equiping screen and though you do get to choose the team that goes out, each mission's requirements pretty much pick the squad for you anyway. Couple this with the fact that you have to micro-manage your team's every move (they won't even shoot back when shot at, just cry out) and there's no multiplayer option except co-operative over a LAN, means that this is one isometric squad-based shooter to be avoided. If you like this style of game you could do worse than buying Fallout Tactics instead, or save yourself [the money] and pick up a copy of Abomination - The Nemesis Project."
2,Could Have Been Better,"Away Team could have been much better. It didn't seem to stand out from all the other simulator type games out there. I was expecting more, but I was a little dissapointed.The graphics are mediorcre and the sound and instruction a little confusing as you play. A little predictable too. I guess I was a little disappointed based on all the other simulator type games I have already.You be the judge."
2,A great opportunity lost,"What a shame. Great idea, great concept, but so poorly delivered. This is not a patch on Commandos 2 and it lacks everything that made Commandos 2 so good. The characters are dull and the games leads you rather then allowing you to direct the flow of the game.Commandos 2 took me best part of a month and I enjoyed every minute of it, as a Trek fan I looked forward to this one but I finished it easily in two days and was sadly bored for most of it. Avoid."
4,Mission Impossible meets Star Trek,"It's an exciting, strategic game with a large number of ways to complete the missions. Kill the Romulan with a phaser blast? (Not easy, they shoot back!) Waste a grenade on him? Try to sneak around him? Can I sneak a Vulcan behind him for a neck pinch?So why only 4 stars? Because after you play the 17 (18?) missions, it's game over. The missions aren't really playable ""over and over again"", and without a mission creator for the Internet community, this game will probably be deleted from your hard drive after its initial play. Contrast that to some excellent, replayable games, ""UT, Quake 3, RollerCoaster Tycoon.....""Again, a very good game, and worth the time, but it's gonna be a short time."
4,Pretty cool for Trek fans,"Disclaimer: I am a huge Star Trek fan and I'm sure that influences my rating.I bought this game years ago and almost got to the final mission, but the CD was stolen before I could finish it. I saw it on Amazon for about $7.00 and decided to grab it. I forgot how much I liked the game until I put it back in the dvd drive. Decent graphics, pretty good story, a few familiar locations and characters (Brent Spiner as Data and Michael Dorn as Worf), and one of my favorite ships in Star Trek, the USS Incursion.If you like Star Trek, it's a pretty fun game that still works on XP and will give you hours of enjoyment. For $7.00 with shipping I am happy with my purchase and I'm excited to go and play it."
4,Good game,"I played Away Team several years ago, lost the disc and can't play it now. I found it to be a great diversion from the typical third person starship games that are so typical of the Star Trek franchise."
2,Don't Bother,Levels are way to small and game play isn't very exciting. Characters wont think for themselves at all and if one gets killed you lose; So much for the red shirts!I'm not even sure it was worth the $10 I paid for it.
4,Very Good as Textbook,This book was recently used as a textbook for an engineering statistics class. Many of the students liked the book and found it easy to read. The level of mathematics in the book is excellent for a college level statistics textbook. I would have given it a five star rating if propogation of error and nonlinear regression analysis were covered in the textbook.
1,More garbage by professional academics,"This book is used in introductory probability and statistics courses, yet it reads like the authors' awkwardly written cliff notes.The authors insist on using multiple levels of mathematical indirection to introduce even the most basic of theorems. Examples in the reading consist mostly of long drawn out, and totally unreferenceable word problems. There are no diagrams to help visualize concepts until chapter four. Summaries are wordy. Summaries of similar topics are inconsistently worded leading to a lack of parallelism, and gratuitously increasing the difficulty of comparing them.Overall, this is a useless book to learn or study from."
2,"Wordy, bland, and needlessly complex","This is the third course in probability I have taken over the last 30 years and have not found a good textbook yet. The book is pure drudgery to read. Overly wordy, complex explanations are the norm. Or as the authors probably would have put it: The text makes use of a multiplicity of non value added ink-on-paper replications of verbal communication to excessively inhibit the coherent transmission of information vis-a-vis the learning construct. Presentation of the math concepts is inconsistent, partly set aside in call outs and partly buried beneath tons of words in the text, and partly assumed from the ether. Problem is, you don't know which.I really would like to know why statisticians feel the need to obscure what is really fairly simple math within a world of illogical terminology and backwards thinking. That is, the actual math is fairly simple assuming you can decipher the word problem and figure out which of the hundreds of formula to use."
4,Pretty Solid,"For what it is, it's pretty good. Very well organized, and easy to read (a little dry, but this isn't exactly a recreational novel). Four stars only because it wouldn't hurt to help us use some modern tools (calculators, computer software, etc), instead of the tables in the back. Maybe that's changed since my 3rd edition."
1,This is the worst text I have ever used,"I am a dean's list mathematics major and I couldn't follow this text at all. This is true because the book is poorly written in a very bland voice, the few examples are often difficult with little or nothing to do with common problems you will encounter, and as a whole, this book seems to assume that all of its readers have a solid background in statistics; the problem with that is this is used in introductory courses. Everything I learned in the class for which this text was required was from lectures, and I normally learn extremely well from text books. If you take a course that requires this text, either try to find another book or run (don't walk) to the good old drop and add department!"
4,Alright...,"I had to have this book for a STAT class I take. Its an alright book. It gives decent examples and explanations of the concepts. But a lot of the answers in the back of the book are wrong, so be careful!"
5,Excellent overview,...a good starting point to Basquiat. Diversity of contributing editors kept the comment rangey. Organization of the work reflects his compositionsal approach...
1,Basquiat Retrospective: Take 2,"The images in this book almost mirror the images shown in the 1st Basquiat retrospective book from the Whitney Museum (edited by Richard Marshall). If you own the Whitney book, there's no need to pick up this one because you'll be looking at a lot of duplicate images. If you don't own a Basquiat book, you can't really go wrong with either edition and I would lean towards the newer book. But there's no need to own both of them. So why the low rating? It's a shame that the curators didn't take the opportunity to add something new for Basquiat fans. Many years have passed since the 1st Whitney retrospective and we're basically presented with a book that repeats what's already been printed. Unfortunately we'll have to wait for someone else to put out a book of new Basquiat material for us to see."
4,Is he really great?,"This is the catalogue for an exhibition held at the Brooklyn museum which benefited from many loans from private collections. The artist's brief career is shown here with many of his best paintings from the pivotal year 1982. The quality of the images is excellent. Now this book has not lifted my doubts whether Basquiat is really a great artist in the line of Twombly and Dubuffet whose influences he acknowledged. Seeing his oeuvre in a retrospective as complete as this one, I can't help but noticing a weakening in the ""late years"", that is after 1984, when he started inserting xerox collages on his canvases (many of these works appear in the book), or when the repetition of his main themes and characters becomes a bit boring. As for the book itself, if you like Basquiat, it is a must-have. If you don't like him, well..."
4,New Find,"I've never heard of these guys nor am I a reviewer extraordinair, but I am here to tell you that this album kicks a__. Sounds like the band at the bar on Friday night. From ""E-Jam"" to ""Cold As It Gets"" to ""Lotto"" to Out Of Sight"" and beyond, you need to hold on to your hat because their going ba__s to the wall. Enough said."
3,ok album that covers various styles,Busta is an energetic rapper who delivers in shows and flows raps well and keeps the beat up...ok offering here that does show his development and some radio hits.
2,Busta's Put Out Much Better Music Than This,"Busta Rhymes is mostly known for his wild and crazy style, hair and ,of course, music. He's come up with some great music from albums like When Disaster Strikes and E.L.E, but his new one just seems out of place from his previous releases. Yes, ""Break Ya Neck"" has a pretty good beat and some other cuts from this record are listenable(""Betta Stay Up In Your House"" and ""What It Is"" to name a few), but overall it just isn't all that great. I would suggest Jay-Z's new one or maybe even Nas's. Either way both are better than Busta's."
4,Mad Ryhmes,"This cd wasn't too bad. I picked it up after hearing the breaking hit singles ""Break Your Neck"" and ""Pass the Courvasier"", and so far it's turned out to have more great hits than I expected. The beats are definately tight, and as you continue to listen you'll find a few more songs that you'll enjoy, such as ""As I Come Back"" and ""What It Is"", along with many others. Hope this review helps with your decision."
4,Doesn't Necessarily Deserve Five Stars!,"Busta Rhymes latest release ""Genesis"" is okay. There are a few bad tracks in the album like ""The Only One"" w/ Mary J. Blige, and ""Shut 'Em Down 2002"". THOSE TWO TRACKS WEREN'T NEEDED! Other than that, the album was perfect! Busta Rhymes could have put a bonus track on the album for the remix of ""Pass the Courvoisier"" but the album is 77 minutes long! He probably couldn't have fit it on anyway."
2,Not all that great...,"I purchased this CD hoping that it would be an excellent album, but..... I was wrong. This album has only about two or three good songs on it, and the rest are just boring and arent appealing. I never listen to this CD anymore. I don't reccomend this CD to anyone. This isn't Busta Rhymes' Greatest production."
2,Break Ya Neck...,I gave it 2 starz for the only tight songs on the cd. What it is and Break Ya Neck [Hint: Buy the singles]
3,"Busta Rhymes Strange, cool, boring, old","Just when you thought you were getting used to Anarchy, this comes along. Genisis, the begining of everything. Well it sounds like thats where he is starting. Just a repeat of his old stuff. A few new goods like everybody rise, break ya neck, truck volume, and a few other of the Dre produced, heavily synthed songs. Its interesting to listen to his views but when you get to the 20th song you start to realize that every 4 songs or so, he just repeats him self to a different backround. Buy it used if you want it. I suggest Anarchy. Just buy one of his albums and youll hear everything that he has.Ps: This cd contains explict sexual content in skits and is probably not appropriate for anyone under 16."
4,Great buy!!!,"Busta came out swinging in this album. my buddy pulled this cd out today and i thought, i just need to listen to it again. the uptempo bangers are awesome. a great album to check outrating A-"
3,Genesis,Genesis I believe this is the revelation for Busta Rhymes no disrespect but the other 4 albums were better and I aint even going to talk about the one that came out after this one.
1,Give me a break,"If anyone wants to take this bet, I'd bet quite a bit of money that the other review, by W--Vira, is a shill. I don't normally write reviews, because I generally only buy things with very high reviews, and I didn't buy this product at amazon. But this stuff is so terrible that it sickens me to think of other people buying it. I actually came to use this starting a couple weeks ago when I grabbed a new one that my wife had bought and never used. It is terrible. It is very very tacky and unpleasant to have on your lips. I have berry, and it is more like wax and less like anything else. I've used it for almost 2 weeks now, and my lips have become more chapped than when I started. This is an inferior product to the big brands (or anything else I've tried, and I've been a brass player since I was like 10 years old, and have always had to use lip balm to avoid with chapped lips) because it does not work at all and is unpleasant to use."
4,Burrows Images 5: The Ultimate Coloring Experience,"This was a 2010 Christmas gift for my 9-year old granddaughter, and even though she ALSO received an iPod from her parents (which kept her very, very busy), she also liked--and used--this very advanced type of coloring book, and soon caught on to the idea of all the different patterns that could be produced by coloring different sectors of the designs differently. I think these are excellent alternatives to the usual kind of children's coloring books, and should make them stretch their imaginations quite beyond the bunnies, trees and simple pictorials in most of these books."
2,Great singer with a moderate quality CD,"1- Her best songs such as : It'll Never Be Over For Me - Don't You Worry Baby, the Best Is Yet To Come ,are not included .2- Quality of the CD is moderate which makes me believe that the publisher (One media Publishing) are copying from puchased CDs and not from master CDs .3- I have to admit that they sell a hard to find materials However the quality of their products is moderate - yes listenable but not the quality u would expect from a a master copied CD but a quality copied from a frequently used CD ."
1,"If I could give it less stars, I would....","In fact, if I could give this NEGATIVE stars, I would. I have never been in favor of book burning, but if I was I would start here. I'm on chapter 4 of this book, and so far it has discussed 1) how white therapists are racist, and if you don't admit you are, you're in denial and MORE racist 2)the fact that I am a spiritually unclean person because I eat meat. And 3) the fact that cancer patients shouldn't get chemo because its worse than the disease, they should look for good herbal and physical therapies instead. I am not kidding, that example is actually used in there. All of this on top of how grinding your own flour and eating organic, locally grown, in-season foods will make you more wholesome and a better therapist. And backed up with a bunch of un-true statements about the benefits of organic foods by the way. I'm upset my grad school forced me to put money in this woman's pocket."
5,This will change the way you approach counseling,This is the book that everyone will be talking about for years to come.
4,excellent album,"bought this album a few months back from amazon mp3 and have been enjoying it ever since. It has remained on constant circulation on my iPhone and will continue to do so.It's well worth it's regular price, so if you can snag it for the daily deal price even better!"
4,"A dark, lovely record for the masses.","Darker tones and imagery, seem to be the focus Andrew's latest, A natural progression that doesn't seem to stray to far from his prior two. But this time, the music as a whole, seems more focused and he's narrowed down and honed in on his strengths. I could easily see this record being Andrew's most successful selling disc to date, because the songs have progressed into a more structured environment. The production is slimmed down and most of Andrew's quirkiness has been smoothed over. Oh yeah, and the whistling is beautiful as ever. I gave it Four stars with room to move up. Quite a lovely dark record indeed!For fans of Sufjan Stevens, Sigur Ros, Radiohead to even My Morning Jacket and Wilco."
4,Andrew a Bird than I'm a bird,"Sorry I don't have time for a well thought out review, but if you've ever dug anything by Andrew Bird, this is a sure thing."
2,Not to my taste,"Based on the reviews I read, I was really looking forward to hearing this. The artwork featuring a bird is very eye-catching. I just couldn't get into the music. I've listened to it twice, hoping that it would improve with familiarity. It didn't. The lyrics might be good but, the musicality of Andrew's work escapes me. There's nothing catchy here and most of the songs are downright depressing."
2,I wish he would learn to play the freakin' guitar!,"First of all, let me offer my support of Invisigoth. A very well-balanced and thoughtful review (which maybe didn't match with the 1-star rating).Secondly, I refuse to join the bandwagon of Andrew Bird worship. Especially around here (the Twin Cities), he gets played very frequently on indie rock stations here (namely, The Current), and the DJs seem to adore him. While I freely admit he's incredibly gifted as a musician, most of his songs seem to boil down to about 2 quite uninteresting chords. And anybody's who's ever plugged in an electric guitar at the music store could sound like his guitar. He seems to have no idea of how to nuance a guitar and amp to really get the richness that is possible. And I'm sorry, but ""Fiery Crash"" is just plain boring!He can do better than this, and I hope he does on his next album."
1,Never got book,I never received this book after numerous times of me contacting the seller thru email and never got a response. I finally decided to contact A-Z to file a claim and then the seller of the book finally contacts me to see if I want the book. Well I had already bought a book from the local bookstore after a month of waiting for my book.I will never buy from this user again!!!!!
5,Top notch product,"Ive been using HS scent wafers for about as long as they have been around. I like taking the wafers and placing them around my stand. Once while using this one, I placed it along a well used trail. I actually had a 6 point walk the trail and stop at each wafer to sniff it. Walk around the tree or bush, sniff it again and move to the next one. HS is the bomb."
5,The album is beautifully printed,"Adams, the Andrea picture is the big picture onlooking effect is good, the picture album was a little small"
1,Don't Bother!,"There were so many ""typos"" and misspellings in this book that I couldn't even finish reading the second chapter. What I did read didn't tell me anything new. This was really a waste of my money!"
2,In my honest opinion.....,"Did anyone proofread the text before publishing??Being a fibromyalgia sufferer myself, I know that we get into a fog and can't write straight, not to mention think straight..(fog) but gee whiz, I actually felt embarrased READING the text of this book! Psst....next time get an editor or at least someone who can spell!"
5,"A deep, ecumenical anthology of the spiritual search","Now that the millenium is drawing to a close, this book is needed more than ever. It is a thoughtful, deeply felt and balanced anthology of writings that come from the deepest heart of humanity. It has inspired and uplifted me and revealed to me a world of wonder, wisdom and compassion that I never knew existed. I have always held a healthy distrust of dogma and spiritual superiority. This book shows that all teachings ultimately converge on themselves. It points to a fresh way to conduct our lives-one of openness, suffering, pain, joy and dignity. It is tuly a wonderful book. If the publisher of the book reads this, I hope it convinces him to reissue it. My copy is dog eared, weathered and yellowed from countless drops of coffee from coffee shops everywhere. For me, it is a sort of spiritual teddy bear that I carry with me everywhere. (So much for non-attachment.)"
2,"Classic content good, but older copy musty and moldy smell","The classic writings were quotable, material thought provoking , experienced writers from a cross section of the world offering age old research, experiences, and wisdom that is pertinent for todays life. The quotes stem from old masters and theologians as:Frizt Kunkel, Karl Barth, Carl Jung, Aldous Huxley,and Thomas a Kempis. Even though this is a classic, the copy which was quoted as being"" collectible"" had a brittle cover, falling apart with handling, the book reaked of mold and musty smell that made it difficult to read at length. This was not cared for as collectible would honor a classic book. I will continue to search for a more updated version with the same editors."
4,The child looks 5,"I bought this for my 2 year old. But I just cracked up when I opened the book for the first time.On the first page, the illustration of the ""child"" looked more like a young adult.I was laughing throughout the whole book because of illustrations of the boy and disproportionally huge potty. But it worked out because my son enjoyed it because Daddy thought it was funny.Overall, the concept is great."
4,"My son ignored at 2, loved at 2 1/2","I got this book because I liked the story and it didn't show bathroom misbehavior - why tell kids about pulling all the toilet paper off the roll? He didn't like it at first, but right around 2 1/2, when he really seemed ready to start training, he really started to like it."
3,Okay....,This book was okay...went from diapers to potty training...but would be good for people who are trying to start their son out early...
4,Good Book,I felt like this was a really good book when preparing my son for the potty. I just wish it didn't get so particular in areas. For example: Michael must wear a diaper at night... I have to skip that page because my son does not wear diapers at all. All in all though it is a good book. We also put undies on his stuffed animals like its displayed on the front and back pages. My son got a kick out of that.
3,It's Ok,"It IS very descriptive...but it's a little long. My 2-year-old has a difficult time paying attention to this book if I read what is written so I invariably end up making up the story to go along with the pictures. It doesn't get my son excited about using the potty like ""A Potty for Me! A Lift-the-Flap Instruction Manual"" which I highly recommend."
4,good book for potty training,"My 2-year-old and I have enjoyed this book. He likes the book and I think it has done a good job introducing the concept to him. The only part I don't like is pushing the standing up to pee for boys, I prefer to start him out sitting and progress to that once the actual going in the potty 100% of the time is established."
5,Helping us to reach that great potty milestone...,"We have nearly every potty book on the market, yet none before this have been as effective, down to earth, and easy for my son to relate to. He loves this book. We enjoy reading it with him. And eventually we'll get there. In the meantime, this is our favourite in the potty training repertoire."
3,Book was okay,"I'm not sure what I was expecting but this book was a little disappointing and I wish there had been more to the story. Book essentially just tells a story of a boy trying to go to the bathroom....so if that's what you are looking for, this book is for you."
5,Excellent!,"My son loves this book. We have not made much progess with potty training, however, he will sit on the potty and have me read this book over and over because he loves it. It makes a good point and gives the kids someone to associate with. Michael is portrayed as a kid like all kids and my son loves him. Michael does all the normal things kids do and he even has accidents but that is ok. I highly recommend this book!"
5,silly book,As a new mom and a first time potty trainer I found this book to be hilarious. My 18 month old son LOVES it too. Great potty training book.
4,Buying a slightly dirty gift...,"The book was good, as expected. However, it required a little clean-up as it was food encrusted to some degree. A gift for my daughter, but not as perfect as the ad claimed!"
3,Nice Book but Son Hated it!,"Not sure why but my son LOVES ALL BOOKS besides this one. I am not sure if it's because he does not want to hear anything about potty training or he just didn't like the book was kind of long. You see my son has no patience when it comes to books, so it better get to the point with some awesome graphics, which this did not ."
5,Great Potty Training Book for Boys,"My son relates to this book. It ""asks"" questions like ""This is Micheal. He wears diapers. Do you wear diapers?"" and my son gets really interested because he thinks the book is talking to him. Very good."
5,Finally!,"Finally, a book that got my toddler interested in using the potty! I'm not sure what it was about this book, but he read it only once or twice before he wanted me to read it to him while he sat on the potty. It has worked great in peaking his interest to potty and be like the character in the book.Also, we tried using M&Ms; as a reward every time he pottied, but then started a sticker chart (found in another book) and that has worked even better!"
4,Cute and simple,"This book is great for introducing younger children to the idea of potty training. It's simple, cute and perfectly sized to keep by the potty. My only complaint is that it is only directed at kids who are being potty trained on a potty chair and not for kids who are learning using a normal toilet."
5,This potty book will make your child into a big boy!,"This book is a great source for potty training toddlers. It will build their confidence, and will gently teach them how they are expected to act as big boys. It has easy to understand text, and visual illustrations that allow children to relate on a more personal level. With warmth and sensitivity, the authors guide young boys though the challenges and rewards of potty training--from the first steps to the joy of graduating to big boy underpants! I highly recommend this book!"
3,"TOO LONG, TOO MUCH INFORMATION","I wouldnt buy this as the first potty book. Maybe if you were reading it to a 3 yr old, it would be ok. But I am reading it to a 2 yr old and its just way way too mature. It talks about every aspect about potty training in a rediculous amount of detail. And I dont mean it's gross, I mean it's almost mechanical (walk into bathroom, face the toilet, sit down.. etc). seems that they could have shorted this book by 1/2. I cant stand reading it. First of all, it sounds rediculous....second it's just soooo long. But with that said, it's not a bad book.. there's nothing wrong with what's in it, just that i wish i bought a different book and never this one."
3,not cardboard!,"I was surprized to see that this book, intended for 2-year-olds, does not have cardboard pages! That means I cannot give it to my son to explore. Also, it's a little wordy. The content is good, but I need something sturdy and fewer words per page."
5,Good Book,"This helped a friend potty train a VERY resistant 3 year old in one weekend. After months of unpleasant struggle, it was a relief to have this book to help out."
3,My Big Boy Potty,My Big Boy Potty I thought a book reading while sitting on the potty was just what i needed to get my grandson to sit a little longer. This did not work.
1,Bogus,I am a freemason and I purchased this book to see just what it had to say about masonry. It had very little to say on the subject. I wouldn't recommend this book to a Jackrabbit.
1,Not Worth The Trouble,"This book is a pretty package of a few facts about the author, some of which are incorrect. The final injustice for me was when they mis-spelled one of my favorite authors, Elizabeth Goudge (spelled in their book Groudge). [...].There are better books out there."
5,The Road to Reunion by Gina Wilkins,I was so happy when I found Gina Wilkins continuing to write aboutthe Family Found series. She deserves five stars for everythingshe writes. I am so happy to have access through my KIndle.
3,Good Read,"Another story of the new generation in Wilkins' Family Found series. (And I cannot wait until the author / publisher digitalizes more of her backlist - the first generation, in other words).The beginning of the book dragged a little, as the setting was basically just the two characters stuck together due to weather and injury. Both leads had been slightly self-isolating: the hero geographically due to injury, guilt and grief; and the heroine, although surrounded by family, rarely strayed far from home.But I really enjoyed the second half of the book, as their environment expanded and more characters came into play. The heroine's conflict was especially interesting: a youngest child, she had to learn to acknowledge that although she thought she resented how everybody told her what to do, she really preferred the safety of not making her own decisions.As always, looking forward to my next by this author."
4,eat your way to good health,"all the receipes are easy to follow and have proven success. is a good book to have if u want to eat your way to good health and the taste is uncomprisingly good. i learnt about the nutritional value ( yin - yang theory ), and the various way to cook ( fry, steam, stew, double boil, simmer etc... ) from this book. best of all, u dont have to worry about identifying the herbs, mdm siong had them pictured and named in chinese character and english."
5,went out on a limb...,"well when i was looking into this product i noticed it was refurbrished, so i said how bad could it be. so i took a chance and ordered it. it arrived on-time, in a perfect box. i opened it, it looked great, perfect condition, perfect cords, full instructions, i use it every day it is a definate buy for anyone. i love this machine. it is perfect for anyone and i would reccommend anyone who wants a great mp3 player."
1,"Pure Junk..ignore the one star, had to put something there","These plants markers came loose in the box and every one of them had fallen apart. The copper part had separated off of the stick. Shoddy, shoddy, shoddy and CHEAP Mdse. All of her products are junk...........had to return 2 other of her items as well"
1,"How about, NO, Page","DDP's book, Positively Page promises an insider look unrivaled by any other wrestling book out there. I have to strongly disagree. This book pales in comparison to Mick Foley's Have a Nice Day. We are given an inside look at DDP, which, as it turns out, is not much of a treat. He is not an interesting subject for a book. If this is going to be the trend of wrestler biographies, then they need to stop now."
1,worthlerss,The book is worthless. He just rambles on about himself on how great he is. Seems he is really a very boaring person who is just pumped up on steriods and likes the tanning booth. Very boaring book on a very boaring person full of himself. After reading the book it is as if he did a bunch of nose candy and extacy on started to write his ego.
5,Way To Go Champ,"I just finished reading the book and wanted to let you guys know how much I loved it. I've been a fan of wrestling for at least 15 years and remember Page from his AWA days. I'm not gonna lie and say I've always been a fan of DDP's b/c i haven't. For some reason, I could never get into his character, but you can't deny his work ethic, passion or heart. After reading the book, my love, respect, and appreciation for Page rose to new levels. I fell in love with his confidence, his passion for wrestling and life, his heart of gold, his never say never attitude; I fell in love with Page. For the wrestling fans, Positively Page is a great look into the life of Page and the journey to the top of the game. For the nonwrestling fans, it's a book about a man overcoming all the odds to achieve his dream. It's one of those books you can read over and over and learn something new or take something from it everytime you read it. Way to go champ :)"
4,Not what you might expect,"This is not really a book about professional wrestling.This is a book that is partially set in the world of professional wrestling. The subject of the book is really positive thinking.It's out of print, and it may be hard to get, but if you are into human potential and the power of change - combining discipline with positive thinking - then this is a VERY good book.If you know (or if you are) a wrestling fan who needs to hear this message, then this may be the PERFECT book.Some people think that Dallas Page is a relentless self-promoter, but they're the ones who haven't been listening. He believes that anyone can do anything that they really want to - if they're willing to work hard enough for it. He uses his own life as the example.It's worth a read."
3,Why Dallas Why,"Pretty good book up until he wrote about the NWO angle then he dropped Kayfabe and treated the story line as if it were a real event. Very disappointing. It was also too much to read everyone and their brother say how great Dallas is. One or two testimonials would have been fine. Overall good story, neat person, lousy writing. Please email me your opinion s_xtreme@hotmail.com"
4,Turning the PAGE,"I didn't like DDP when I first started watching WCW. That changed quickly, as I admired his work ethic in the ring. Even as a heel, he got the job done, and I became a fan long before he became the People's Champion. In his book, Positively Page, I now understand why I've been a fan so long. Page has overcome a lot of disiversity in his life, and the book details it in a very unique way, from first person from Page through various narratives by friends and others. The book reads like a television documentary, and it's a very easy read. My personal library is made up of over one thousand books, and this is one I would highly recommend for sports fans, sports entertainment fans, or for anyone who likes to see the underdog win."
4,DDP,"good book and all, ddp's a cool guy and everything, but none of the books compete to foley's 2. but hell, ddp still made a good read. get foley's 2 first (like you haven't) then get bobby the brain's second."
2,I am sure this is good,"I am sure this is worth reading but I do not have time,. I joined teamddp.com and think that is going to be the right fit for me,"
3,Ok,"Not bad book, but read more like thsese that I liked much better . But it's worth reading.just not top list."
3,Hmmmm... Its ok,"I bought this case with the main reason for protection, and when i recieved it does the job the nano fits in from the bottom, and a small belt clips closing the the bottom case.The belt aluminum belt clip can be removed so you can hold the case in hand, and a screen protector is given with the case that sticks on the screen, but i didnt use becausei didnt remove the original nano plastic cover im using it with it.The case is ok you can charge, listen to music while the case is on but you cant use the dock for charging but without the case.Thanks;)"
4,Fits like a glove,The only thing preventing 5 stars is that I personally don't like the belt clip on the base.
4,Wonderful,This book is a wonderful collection of stories of someones actual life! It shows daily struggles that everyone goes thru and shows us how we can deal with it. Its funny and has lessons we can learn from. All in all a great book.
4,This was a really fun book !!!,I am a major Grease fan and I thought I knew it all. I have even had people try to stump me before and they were never able to. Well this book did it !! It had so many facts that I didnt know about the movie and I considered myself the expert. Loads of fun for a Grease fan even if you just try to answer the questions on your own. Good luck!!
1,Manufactured wrong.,"I purhased the StrongArm 4221L and 4221R for my 1997 Subaru Legacy Wagon. The Right fit perfectly, however the Left was identical to the Right (but stamped L) but could not be used on the left side. The 4221L StrongArm DID NOT fit the Left side of the vehicle. Ironically it will fit the right side perfectly like the 4221R..."
5,Contacting Author,I am DESPERATELY trying to get hold of the author. Does anybody out there have any information for me PLEASE?
3,Incomplete History and Numerous Typos,"I have several of the various Ultimate Guides now, and the Fantastic Four one, while informative, was definitely subpar. There are many typographical errors, which are a pet peeve of mine, and there seems to be little on Dr. Doom and barely a mention of Onslaught. Seeing as how Doom is the main FF villain and the FF were so closely involved with the Onslaught storyline a few years back, I would have expected more information on them. Not being a FF afficionado, I don't know if there are other areas lacking, but I wouldn't be surprised."
1,I found this books content inappropriate for young children.,"My daughter brought this book home and the title made me curious, so I read it. The storyline of this book is disjointed, the content is utterly ridiculous and serves only to insult the intelligence of young readers. Under the guise of fiction/mystery literature this book is laden with occult symbolisms aimed directly at the unsuspecting minds of young children . All in all, I find this to be more appropriate reading for 5th grade and up."

4,Gill's introduction is worth the price,"You can get Plato online for free, but Parmenides is not a dialogue you want to just read any translation.Gill's translation is (according to my Plato professor) one of the best.Her introduction was worth the price of admission. She offers cogent analyses of the text, bit by bit, as well as putting the story in context and making some sense of what is otherwise a bewildering barrage of arguments."
3,The basic receiver is OK for a second,"The basic receiver is OK for a second receiver or for someone that doesn't watch a lot of TV.Mine came with an access card & was easily swapped out.The person that wrote he moves his box from room to room you simply need to purchase a powermid, sold here or at [...].You place one powermid transmitter in the room where you want to watch TV & the powermid receiver by the directv receiver. The powermid changes an IR signal to RF so you can change channels."
4,good for collectors,"While probably not worthwhile for the casual fan, those who crave access to the rarer Smiths songs will find this CD to be of great value. I Keep Mine Hidden is a short and chipper little song that grows on you in time, Work is a Four Letter Word is a fine cover of the Cilla Black song, and What's the World? is my personal favorite on the disc, a live cover of an excellent James song. Definitely worth it for those who yearn for those rare songs."
2,Inessential,"The Smiths are one of my favorite bands, but this single just isn't very good. ""Sweet and Tender Hooligan"" is a great song, but the single's three extra tracks just aren't up to the high standard that The Smiths set throughout their short career. If you're a completest, a review won't stop you from buying this. For everyone else, however, the disc just isn't worth the cash."
3,Not what's pictured,The product pictured that can be dipensed by a grease gun actually came in a tub. Not what I ordered!
1,Major Disappointment,"Beware! This disk (unbelievably) has a truncated version of the title track that runs just 2:46 and only serves to RUIN a very nice song. Shame on the producer(s) of this CD. C'mon, people, IT'S THE TITLE TRACK for heaven's sake. A buyer has the right to expect the complete version of at least THAT track. Thumbs down, folks. Way, WAY down!"
5,Another Winner from Margaret Rolfe!,This is my favorite although all of Margaret Rolfe's books are excellent! You won't be disappointed!
4,"This is a ""must-have"" for foundation piecers","If you enjoy foundation piecing and animals, this is the book for you. The only negative is that the blocks are not all the same size."
4,Great Field Guide!,"My husband and I are amateur birders and this was our first field guide for local birds. It is nice to have a guide without photographs and one with photographs. This one has drawings that have often helped me differentiate between similar species, like Baltimore and Orchard orioles. This book also has a wonderful suggestion section for places to find the bird that you are looking for and when to look for it. This stays in our birding bag all year long!"
5,LOIS THE WITCH,"Lois the Witch, by Elizabeth Gatskell, has long been forgotten in catalogues such as I sight (Australia) but it is a worthy classic. The copy I received is an excellent production. BUT, most valuable from an historian's (and even psychologist's) view, is the invaluable 'Foreword' by Jenny Uglow.Thankyou, Amazon, for 'finding' me this recent 2003 edition of Elizabeth Gatskell's 1859 work.Regards Lois Baglin.(PS I do not claim to be a witch - only an 'independent historian' !)"
4,Good all around camera,"I purchased this for a cruise to the Bahamas. Camera powers up quickly. Autofocus takes a little while in low light conditions. Lots of options for true ""photographers"", too many for me so far. I used underwater and picture quality was near perfect. Great all around camera as a replacement for my old Kodak digital."
4,Pent optio w30,"Product is great for outdoor use, wonderful detail in the pictures, but I was surprised when screen changed to white on one side. The camera still works well -- do not like that I have to send to manufacturer and not deal with the people I purchased from"
4,Pentax Optio W30 makes it Easy to Take Great Pictures,I've only had this camera about three months and will do a long term review at a later date. I bought this camera primarily to take pictures from my boat in Choctawhatchee Bay and on river canoe trips. I was looking more for splash resistance as I don't plan opn taking photos under water.The W30 is easy to use and takes very nice rich looking pictures.The camera is well made and the size makes it easy to bring everywhere. The video is very good also but you must switch to pan focus or the sound of the auto focus motor is about all you will hear on playback. I plan to contact Pentax to see if there is a setting that will make it automaticly go to pan focus when movie mode is selected.So far this camera has exceeded my expectations.
2,Pentax W30 - Dont buy it!,"I used the Pentax W30 for 3 weeks and it already died. It won't turn on. Seems to be moister in the screen. Even when I did use it the picture quality in movie mode was poor. Underwater movies and normal movies were grainy and jerky, even though I set for max resolution. Thank goodness Amazon will allow me to return it - then I'll order an Olympus, which get better reviews online. And this from a lifelong Pentax camera user."
2,Nice camera ...not water tight,"We bought this camera and were impressed with both above and below water pictures. However, on our second snorkeling trip the camera would turn itself on and take continuous pictures. We had to take the battery out until the camera dried out. When we returned the camera to Pentax, after just three months, they replied that we ""exceeded the waterproof capabilities."" So don't take it snorkeling."
3,Didn't keep it,"This camera is very similiar to the last Pentax that I owned, which stopped working after a trip to the beach. I figured I would try out the waterproof/sandproof variety. The camera worked fine initially, but then refused to link with my computer to download pictures. I'm not sure why. I was most disappointed that there is no lens protector. So I ended up returning the camera within the ten day period allowed by Amazon."
3,AC Power Adapter,"The W30's Owner's Manual shows that the K-AC63U AC Adapter is an optional, extra-cost item and is not included with the camera.3 stars rating because I don't have the camera (yet), and Amazon doesn't allow a (none) rating, so rather than give it a 1 or 5 star rating, 3 stars for neither good nor bad. Just pointing out that the camera does not include the AC adapter."
3,"Okay, but not for profesionals","The Optio W30 is a good investment for a basic point-and-shoot camera with the waterproof feature. But it isn't for the professional photographer that wants some of the other advancements you'll find in a straightforward digital. Frankly the lens is disappointing for anything you want larger than a 5x7 print of. Macro photography is out of the question... it takes the shots but you loose all quality.Again, waterproof is great... but don't buy it for a replacement of your good digital."
3,Pentax is okay,Too many gadgets as I just wanted quality pictures. Really wanted SLR but none were available. I wouldn't want to use it under water even if it claims to have this feature. I go kayaking and thought if I ever fell overboard that it might be prudent.But why did it get all fog up after a rain (humidity?)? Movie clips and recording are not features that I care for. And adjusting picture quality without downloading is nearly impossible to really see the results. Best to download and fix at that time. You can't record at the same time as taking the picture...so what's the point? Pictures seem to be lighter and I must adjust color and tint to most pictures to reflect what I saw. Expensive camera and a little disappointed.
1,JUNK ALL THE WAY AROUND,"I bought this camera because I thought it would be an upgrade from the fabulous Pentax W20 waterproof camera. Rather this camera takes very poor, pixellated photos, no matter what the setting is on. I almost feel like I got a lemon. I have reset the settings, read the manual front to back and called Pentax customer care (who don't give a crap!) This camera is as good as garbage. If you need a good camera, then get the Pentax W20 which is truly the more superior of the 2."
2,OK Camera: Good Features but Non-Perfect Waterproof Design/Workmanship : Water enters LCD,"Somebody else has also experienced this problem, i read that in review. But i ignored and bought it. When I tested in merely 1 or 2 feet of water.. that's it .. Water was there in between Camera LCD and the transparent hard plastic over that LCD. I thought it would evaporate or drain out but after 2 days it was still like that!!Otherwise camera is good with pretty good features & pictures. Bad quality with low light/ night pictures.Waterproof feature was one which struck me but finally it was the one for which I ended up returning camera."
1,"Do not buy this camera, it is not waterproof","I used this camera once in the water. The entire screen is water logged and the camera is broken. I don't know how Pentax can claim this camera is waterproof as it clearly is NOT. If you are looking for a waterproof camera, get the one by Olympus. I had that one and it was just amazing (until it was stolen). This camea also takes horrible photos at night, day time shots were just fine, but you could get much, much more for the price."
1,Don't by this for waterproof capability,"Don't buy this camera if you are buying it for it's waterproof capability. I had one and it took good photos, but the first time I took it near the water-- not even under water mind you, just to the beach playing in the surf, it leaked and got water behind the LCD. Upon inspection it had a small hairline crack, which I don't know where it came from because it had never been dropped, etc. I literally ended up throwing away $300. I now have the Olympus 1030SW and it's great! Go with the Olympus instead, it's tougher, takes awesome photos, can go deeper and for longer and takes great terrestrial and underwater photos. Don't waste your money on this one!"
2,"It's Ok, but it doesn't take great pictures","I've had this camera for 6 months now. I like the waterproof aspect since I can take it boating or to the beach and not have to worry. My first battery failed within a week of getting the camera and it was a hassle getting a replacement battery from the company.But, I think it just doesn't take very good pictures. At least 25% of the pictures I took on vacation this summer turned out blurry or out of focus, no matter what setting I put it on. It's also very slow to capture the picture, so I frequently miss shots. Finally, the flash doesn't reach very far, so anything I try to take in dim light doesn't come out very well.I had the Pentax 43WR for a few years and loved it, so when it was time to upgrade, this seemed like the ideal camera to purchase. I'll be getting a new camera soon, which is a shame since I've had this one such a short time, but I just don't think it's a very good camera."
2,Pentax W30 waterproof camera,"A small and compact waterproof camera that takes very good pictures. It took some time to figure out all the features. I wish that it had an optical view finder as I use a lot in bright sun and the screen is hard to use in these conditons but that is a problem with all the newer generation of digital compact cameras. Overall, a good camera for what I will be using it for."
4,Great for outdoor adventures,"I really like this camera so far. I do tons of white water rafting so a water proof camera was a must. I am very impressed with it's video capabilities. It takes 640x480 video at 30fps. That is very good for a still camera. Don't plan on using the zoom while in video mode, I believe it is only a digital zoom. The interface is simple and intuitive. The over all picture quality is good but not great. My old Nikon took a little better still images. The bottom line is; if you plan on doing a lot a activities where things will get wet, this is the camera for you, if not, you can get a camera in this price range with a little better image quality."
3,Don't take it too deep,Don't take this camera deeper than indicated or it will explode. Otherwise takes decent photos.
1,Not very waterproof at all!,"While initially impressed with the camera, my enthusiasm waned when I took it snorkeling. 20 minutes later the camera was rendered inoperable as water had entered the battery compartment. I contacted Amazon who - to their credit - sent me a replacement camera immediately at no charge. Sadly the camera suffered the same fate as the first - except this time water found its way into the screen within the first minute of submersion. I again contacted Amazon who informed that""As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread thanwe originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement.We will gladly refund you in full for the return of this item.please return the set."" Fair enough. I then placed an order for the SeaLife ECOshot SL321So, excellent customer service from Amazon, dissapointing product from Pentax."
1,do not touch this camera,"I bought this camera for a holiday in the Caribbean. After using it for 20 minutes in shallow water, it failed. I returned it to Pentax who (eventually) claimed the warranty was void because it had sand on the battery cover which has compromised the waterproofing. This is nonsense. How it could have worked under water with sand on the battery cover was beyond the Pentax technicians ability to explain. Also, the possibility that any sand on the battery cover had lodged there after the camera failed was also too much for the Pentax customer service (an oxymoron if ever there was one) to explain.So, lousy camera and even worse customer service."
3,so so,"My first Optio W30 got water inside of LCD for the first time I used it under water. So, I exchanged it to a new one. My second one didn't get water inside yet. It's working fine so far. Auto focusing is rather slow but you get what you paid for."
4,Did the job underwater,Excellent camera to take snorlking. I bought this just for underwater use and it was great. Clear pictures and no problem with any leakage. It also takes wonderful pictures outside of water as well.Well worth the money
4,Fun little camera,"For the price this is a great camera. We got it and went on vacation to the lake right away. Took the camera in the water, took lots of photos and some short video. Pictures are great, video is pretty good, and it's so fun being fearless with your camera and photo taking. You get pictures from perspectives you never would otherwise.On the cons is a slight shutter delay making action shots tougher but we still got plenty.For the price it is great, it can be your solo vacation camera especially in wet or dusty areas."
5,Waterproof camera rocks in shallow waters,"I needed a waterproof camera for snorkeling and other water activities on a trip to Hawaii. I bought this camera since there were very few choices for product offerings in the waterproof & digital catagories. I am really impressed with this camera as this was my first time snorkeling and I had great pictures (see customer gallery). The camera does require good light, so it is better in shallow water and clear days. I also own a Sony DSC 5MP camera which works better on large scenic pictures for me, but as far as underwater, light, compact, and worry-free this camera totally exceeded my expectations. I normally do not write reviews, but for the first time I felt compelled to let people know that this camera works wonders for use around water."
2,Worked great for one whole year! Then died for no reason...,"Difficult to say what happened. It was a phenomenon. I took pictures of my child learning to swim at 1 year of age and then as he approached his 2 year birthday it died. Pentax was no help, a repair costs 70% of the cost of a new camera. What to do?The camera worked like a dream for the first 12 months. Perfectly. I mean like a dream. Excellent quality, water proof. Durable. Good battery life, you name it. Then it up and died. Hmmm....."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,"Although the waterproof feature is fun, and it's really nice to be able to take both stills and videos on the same camera, the shutter lag on the Optio is obscenely slow. This camera is really only useful for landscapes, portraits, and videos. When you snap the shutter to catch that once-in-a-lifetime shot, you end up with a picture that's a good 2 seconds AFTER that irreplaceable moment. I tried my best to make this camera work for me (the quality of the photos is really quite good), but I've got 8 & 10 year old daughters, and I finally got sick and tired of my photos showing the top of their heads instead of their beautiful smiles, or their feet on the ground when I actually snapped the shot with their feet in the air during a perfect cartwheel! The software Pentax sends with the camera is pretty much worthless, too. Needless to say, the camera is already packed up to return."
4,Good academic introduction,I found this book to be a good academic (maybe a bit boring) introduction to the subject of the crusades. It is not a garrish or sensational account of this Christian invasion of the Levant between the 11th and 13th centuries. Instead is an attempt to dispassionately classify the crusades in an academic manner while looking at the factors that instigated and allowed its continuation for 2 centuries.
5,Fascinating,"The book follows a clear outline and presents information in a dispassionate, academic manner. I knew very little about the Crusades to begin with, although I had some vague ideas from my college classes (there were ~7 of them, they were ""bad"", Christians were at fault). This book presents a much more balanced take on the Crusades and proposes that the reasons behind them were not, as so often assumed, greed and imperialism, but instead that they followed ""just war theory"" and had a heavy focus on penance and sacrifice. It was refreshing to read an account of the Crusades that didn't simply dismiss them as ""religion-provoked violence"", but instead offered plausible insights into why they were fought and why they were important. An excellent read! Very highly recommended.(from a 20-year-old college student)"
4,Macro Look at What Were the Crusades?,"Nice that this scholar of the Crusades boils down all his analysis and insight into this controversial history in terms of answering these questions: Who Were the Crusaders? What Was Their Motivation? When did they Crusade? By Whose Authority Did they Crusade?I enjoyed this scholarly presentation and agree with the other reviewers that it is not lightweight, but solid research and engagement with other views, as well as helpful recommendations for further investigation.Only wish is one more question answered: What is the Crusades Legacy?"
5,A voice that will reach deep inside of you and wont let go!,"If anyone misses the true, untouched vocals of years past; ie, Bob Segar, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, then by all means, Will Hoge is what you are missing! His vocals take you back to the days before all the studio hype, and remind us all that indeed real singers still exist afterall! Will Hoge sings about real life and he seems to pour every ounce of his soul into every note! I am in awe of his music and am only sad that radio today does not trust in true talent for its airwaves but instead gives in to P.R and illusion! This guy is the real deal, period! Consumer warning; If you dare to listen to this guy's music, you will get hooked!"
4,Will's back with more great music!!,"I've been a Will Hoge fan back since his days as the lead singer of Spoonful. His music has gotten better with every concert performance and album track. ""Blackbird"" is a tremendous follow-up to ""Carousel."" Each song on ""Blackbird"" tells a meaningful story, and the best part is that you'll have fun listening to Will's powerful voice and hard-charging, back-to-basics, Rock N' Roll."
4,An underated singer,"When I first saw this album, I thought it was a compilation of Cameron's singles and other songs, but after realizing that his most popular hit, ""It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday,"" is not among the tracks, then I realized that these are covers of some of the most popular songs, recorded at Motown. ""It's So Hard"" appears on the soundtrack of the film ""Cooley High,"" and subsequently covered by Boyz II Men. This particular set from Cameron includes ""It's a Shame,"" recorded by the Spinners during their short tenure at Motown. Cameron sang with the Spinners before embarking on a solo career. One of his singles is included in the set, ""You're What's Missing in My Life,"" which was previously recorded by the Supremes, but only as an album filler. Cameron gives these songs an edge as a strong, soul singer. If you are a Cameron fan, you will probably want this in your collection. As a note, Cameron joined the Temptations; see their ""Legacy"" album of 2004."
3,brionz2003,"THIS CD WOULD BE BETTER IF IT DID NOT HAVE SOME SAD SAD REMAKES OF POORLY DONE MOTOWN HITS. G.C.'S VOICE IS IN RARE FORM HE SOUNDS GOOD. THE KEYBOARDS AND DRUM MACHINE DON'T MAKE IT. NEXT TIME GET A SMALL BAND,GUITARS,BASS PLAYER,DRUMS AND KEYBOARDS.ONE BRIGHT SPOT HE SINGS HIS HEART OUT ON IT'S A SHAME"
2,Made In China,"These wear on the foot like Wolverine boots. Leather stain bled into my socks and even tinted my skin. Not at all what I expected when I ordered Carolina Boots. I was disappointed before I even put the boots on, when I saw ""Made in China"" on the tongue. It's really just another lesson in... ""You get what you paid for."" :S"
2,Not as good as Abbot's first novel,"I was really really looking forward to reading this second novel of Cameron Abbott's and was really disappointed. (Ms. Abbott's first novel was 'To the Edge.') The storyline and characters are almost identical as the ones in her first novel (To the Edge). However, in this second book, the characters were much less likable and romantic/sexual. I turned this book into my local gay bookstore for a store credit as soon as I could.I would NOT recommend this book and I hope Ms. Abbott's next book has more likable characters and does not get into the nitty gritty of 'the law' and concentrates more on developing the romantic relationship between her characters. I usually have this same gripe (the lack of developed characters) when i read mysery novels, which is why I hardly read them anymore."
2,"Not a great single, very far removed from previous b sides","The b sides here are quite heavy in comparison with previous single releases. 45 sounds like an early 90's garage indie band with too much distortion on their guitars. Eleven miles out even features Jez using curse words, very very odd and does not seem to fit well.Pretty poor effort but one for the completist and you get the video for BWT."
5,Why look (much) further?,"This is an absolutely excellent textbook on the Ancient Greeks. One would be hard pressed to find a better, more thorough or enjoyable accounting of the Greeks under one cover. What really sets this book apart to me though is that it is rarely dry - history does not need to be so! and Morris & Powell render their history of the Greeks beautifully - their narrative is both compelling written and clear (a beautiful marriage indeed). The narrative is not simply the authors' voices either - the text is judiciously interspersed with primary texts of all types. So, in sum - this is a superb book that deserves to be on your shelf (read with enjoyment)."
5,Cool.,This dragon has tons of detail and is very realistic looking. Was smaller than expected but perfect for a 7 year old or a collector.
4,Rawr!,Nice though not as detailed as many schleich figures. i am happy with this toy however. note that i purchsed it for drawing reference and not for a child...however i think any child into dragons would find this a wonderful toy.
5,Dragons Are cool,"This is a great toy for dragon lovers, I dont use it as a toy, but it sits up on top of my computer monitor."
2,Dragon,The dragon had too many sharp points on it and had to be taken away for a later day. The details were wonderful but I would say it is not ready for kids under 5 who throw their toys around.
5,the best dragon,"we looked all over for a good-looking, durable dragon action figure. this is it! my boys were only 2 and 4 at the time and it has been stomped on, thrown down the stairs and who knows what else. it thought for sure it wouldn't hold up, but it has! it still looks great despite all the abuse it's endured. beautifully crafted, but not too scary for little ones. great product and great brand."
4,Very nice dragon,I was shopping for realistic dragon toys and this one fit the bill. The body details are very nice and it is a little larger than some of a Papu dragons. I was pleased.
4,Hayes Ford Manual Review,The Ford Escort Automotive Repair Manual is a great guide to all the specifics and important details that the owner of the Ford Escort must have to hand. It has detailed explanations of all the operations and internal wiring of the Ford Escort and guides you through al the changes that need to be made to changes or repair any parts within your Ford Escort. I very good guide.
3,Not what I expected,"I love Moroccan Dry-Cured Black Olives. My local high-end deli offers them, but they are really expensive. So, I thought I would give these a try and see if I could save a little money. I have two issues with this product: (1) they are so salty (and I'm a salt lover) that after a couple of tries I just chucked them out and recycled the jar and (2) with shipping they were really no less expensive."
1,Wilson Bball,Very poor quality product; the gluing of the different parts of the ball are not uniformly glued as the individual pieces are not cut to the right size. Do not buy this.
2,Nice Map But.....,"There's no streets drawn on Ko Samui!! The route numbers are actually printed, along with hotel names and attractions, but there are no roads printed on the island whatsoever...The rest of the map seems ok, but if you need Ko Samui, don't bother with this one..."
2,durable but...,"Product is durable, but as with any plastic product, a determined chewer can trash it and should not be left alone with it. It is designed to be easy for a dog to pick up (a cone-shaped protrusion centered on the underside prevents it from laying flat on the ground), but as a result, it does not fly as well, or as far, as a conventional frisbee."
4,A great Stocking stuffer & more...,"This is one of Kelly's finest projects. I loved all of her others, but this one tops the list. My fav is ""Ave Maria"". Very mellow, but deep. A must listen. My least favorite is the ""If I Lose Christmas"" song. I first heard it at a store and thought it was just some kid singing on one of their karaoke display machines. But to my surprise when I asked the sales person, they said, ""Nope, that's on the CD!! Nevertheless, I bought it...and thank God for the skip button!!!!!"
3,"3 1/2 stars, one of the better Xmas albums","Kelly Price, with this Christmas album, showed once again that she can sing over any track given to her. Unfortunately, the same CANNOT be said for her guest stars. Though Mary Mary and Winona Judd turn in great performances on ""Mary's Song"" and ""In Love At Christmas"" respectively, her family on the title track show that they aren't the best singers in the world. This is especially true when Kelly's kids sing on ""If I Lose Christmas"", which made me lose my appetite. A rule of thumb: If your kids can't really sing, don't put them on the album!But I still can't front on the great performances that Kelly turns in, and as with most R&B singers, she sounds better singing gospel like on ""Christmas Medley"", ""Go Tell It on the Mountain"" and ""Ave Maria"". If you love Kelly's voice and can't stand her singing about people not accepting her weight size or about heartache, then this album is a good escape from her usual fare."
1,"Kelly, you should have spent more time on this album","I love Kelly Price and I think she's fabulous. However, this album sounded like she threw it together in a week. I can understand that Kelly wanted her family members to be on this album. I think it's a great idea. However, her family cannot sing nearly as well as she can. It was painful to hear her tone deaf children singing on ""If I lose Christmas"". Her ""Ave Maria"" could have been incredible if she would have gotten a language coach to teach her how to pronouce the Latin. ""Mary's Song"" is beautiful, but as a whole, the album is quite terrible. I'm sorry Kelly, I know how much you love Christmas, but this was a second rate effort. Sorry."
2,Had a lot of potential,"I was really excited about this cd until I heard it. She sold me on it when she gave an interview on a local radio station. The snipets I heard were great. It wasn't until I bought it that the tone deaf folks singing made this a flop for me. Too bad because this is the first cd of hers I ever bought. The best song is ""In Love at Christmas"". that's the only one I can really get into. Perhaps it was the professional singers in the background-hmm. Sorry Kelly-maybe next year."
2,What a disapointment!,Clearly the worse she has ever came out with! Only one good song on entire CD....
2,Disappointing,"Let me start by saying that I love Kelly Price's voice and music. Unfortunately, this CD was full of one lackluster performance after another. I'm sure that she enjoyed putting these works together. The CD lacks the professional polish that it should have, however. The thing that really put it over the top as a CD that I will not keep was her performance of ""Ave Maria"". I simply cannot overlook the repeated and overtly mispronounced words in the song. I also don't feel that there are many songs on the CD that use all of the great qualities of her voice to it's best advantage. If you're a big Kelly Price fan, buy it used and keep it on the shelf."
2,WHO DID HE REALLY TALK TO????,"AFTER READING THIS BOOK, I HAD TO WONDER WHO THIS MAN REALLY HAD HIS CONVERSATION WITH ON BOARD THAT AIRPLANE? AFTER I READ IT, I FELT SO SAD. SO I STARTED LOOKING AT THE PICTURE OF MY BROTHER. THEN I GOT MAD, HE DOES NOT LOOK REFINED! AS A MATTER OF FACT I THINK HE IS STILL ANGRY. I AGREE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DRESS CRAZY. BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE OF OTHER COLORS WHO HAVE MADE THEMSELVES LOOK LIKE ANIMALS. SOME PEOPLE LOOK LIKE ANIMALS WITH OUT TRYING. IT WAS OK READING, ALMOST AS ENTERTAINING AS STAR TREK. NOW WHAT I REALLY BELEIVE IS THAT GOD LOVES HIS CREATION. AND IF HE CAUSES ANY ONE TO GO INTO BONDAGE, IT IS ONLY TO BRING THEM OUT VICTORIOUS. I LOVE WHO GOD MADE ME TO BE."
1,Mr.Carter needs to do further research.Sounds like theories,"I have not read Mr.Carters book at this time but plan to,however I did see him on the 700 Club where he talked about the book and some of his reasons as to why black people were slaves are unreal and not backed up biblically,Ex.The Egyptians worshipped pagans gods,therefore we were punished because it this .Yes,this true about the Egyptians ,but this has nothing to do with us. Blacks brought here from slavery were from WEST AFRICA and are NOT of the same tribe as the EGYPTIANS!!.2nd Because I am born again, the word says"" ""Therefore if any man be in Christ,he is a NEW creature:OLD things are passed away;behold all things are NEW""2Cor 5:17.Any curses in my bloodline and sins were forgiven and are covered by the BLOOD of Christ.Also Mr Carter needs to do further study.This country still celebrates one of the most PAGAN and SATANIC days of the year,HALLOWEEN.The tradition was brought here by Europeans passed on from the DRUIDS."
5,Awesome!,I could hardly put this book down once I started to read it. The facts that Rev. Carter provides about Black history are substantiated through the Bible. I think that any person that reads this book will understand why Black people have gone through what they have. Black people can be proud of their heritage. This book is for people of all ages.
5,HELP,Help!!! Someone STOLE my battered copy of Forum Feasts! Can you believe it? I desperately need one of the recipes. Cheese Grits made with stone ground grits. I would be ever so thrilled if some kind person would e mail me the recipe through this review.
5,Rock On!,"The first I have heard of Unloco was from buying tickets to the music as a weapon tour. I bought their cd and it was great. It has a perfect mix of hard rock with some softer areas. The lyrics have powerful meaning and impact. All around it is noticable that the band is close. Vocals are excellent (how do people ever sing like that?) The drums were hot too. (I'm taking good care of your stick pedro!) Bass and guitar bring the cd together all around. I absolutely recommened buying this cd. They are a promising band, and I can't wait to see what's next."
5,Unloco is finally coming into their own,"I have been a fan of Unloco for years as they played the clubs in Austin, TX. This new CD is proof that they have the talent to keep making great music for a long time. They are a great group and you have to listen to them to love them, so buy the CD's."
3,"Disappointing, but OK....","NO! One of the most original bands out there today have lost it! There originality that is. I have to agree with Bob613, this band made little progress with this album. Actually, in my opinion, they made a kind of reverse-progress, if you will. Maybe it's due to the loss of their guitarist. The songs were not as unique as Healing's were. The lyrics are not terrible, but they are nothing knew. Just turn on the radio and you'll hear any band sing about the same thing. The lyrics are easily relatable, though, for most people, anyway. But the songs lost creativity. The songs are also not as hard as Healings, which isn't exactly a bad thing (my favorite track is actually the acoustic song - texas), but a thing to keep in mind. The songs are decent, however, just nothing new and astounding. If you're looking for progression and a hard album, don't buy this. But if you are a radio person, then this album is for you. Some Top-Picks are: Crashing, Failure, Making Me Hate You, Texas."
2,whats all the hype about-they arent good,i have given unlco so many chances to impress me with their music and it just hasnt happened.im giving them a 2 for effort.this is some bland stuff here folks.avoid
4,Actually...4 1/2 stars....but anyways...,"Heres my short story about first hearing unloco. I was going to go to a concert called the ""Spring Thing"", hosted by a local radio station and Molson Canadian beer, featuring Chevelle(^_^) and several other bands including unloco. So, I went looking for samples of songs by each band that was going to be there. First I looked for unloco songs. At their site I downloaded an MP3 of ""Failure"", and I was hooked. Then I downloaded from them an MP3 of ""Hands and Knees"", and I became more hooked. So, after seeing them, me and my friend Paul got our hands on the CD. Needless to say, I now have another band on my long list of favorites. There's really only one song I don't completely like, and thats ""Neurotic"", but its still a good song, I just don't like it as much as the other songs. In my opinion, the best songs are ""Drowning In It"", ""Making Me Hate You"", ""Crashing"", ""Empty"", and ""Watching Me Slip"". Buy this CD, these guys are pretty damn good..."
3,diarrhea cha cha cha,"this cd is good, i like it. but ive found that the title track, ""becoming i"", sounds strikingly similar to the ultraspank song ""sponge"", go ahead and give it a listen, the guitar part is practically note for note. but dont get me wrong, i think unloco is good, but the originality part is being held back"
2,Lousy live,"I've seen a couple of reviews here saying that Unloco was really good on the Music as a Weapon tour and recommending this CD based on that show. Well, I also saw them and I thought they were awful. Their drummer is really good, and vocals weren't horrible, but their sound is just repetitive and boring. I don't recommend them at all based on the live show. They played 7 or so songs and I couldn't wait for them to get done so we could move on to better bands. The other two with me at the concert also thought they weren't any good, including the one guy who had really heard of them and liked them before the concert."
5,For those who are bored......try something new,"For those who think all new music is boring, you must check these guys out. I saw them live on the Music as a weapon tour. Several poeple thought they sucked til they heard the cd, then within minutes, they were hooked, as was I. My fave track on the cd is by far Making Me Hate You. If you crave something new and fresh, that kicks you good, or can help you relax (tracks like failure), this is for sure worth a listen. Also be sure to check out their first album...healing. its just as good, but pure hard core rock."
2,Becoming Nothing..... Healing Something,"One word... Repetitive. Most of the songs sound the same. All of the songs are about the same thing... relationships. Becoming i is Unloco's biggest mistake. Healing, on the other hand, is a good record. A lot heavier and a lot better. It's too bad they broke up though. When I think of Unloco, I think of their first album Healing.And to Adam from Princeton, Wv and your Nov. 21 review... yes Unloco did break up... i mean look at what your review said... ""i saw them a couple of months back.."" Did you think, perhaps, that maybe they could have broke up in that two month range? For the record, the break-up was from musical differences."
4,It kinda grows on you,"Unloco is one of those bands who you think are just another Staind. Well, I dont think they are. On Becoming I they show that they know how to write mature lyrics to their music that people can relate to easily. I also enjoyed the acoustic songs, those were dope. My favs are ""Crashing"", ""Bruises"", ""Watching Me Slip"", and of course the best one ""Texas""."
3,Mary Wells' very last recordings,"British producer Ian Levine signed Mary Wells to his Motorcity label as one of the first in 1987, and the material on this album was recorded in the period 1987-90. Mary Wells would never record again. She died from throat cancer 1992. This re-issue opens with a remake of ""My Guy"" which is uptempo and fresh and in fact the best of the re-recordings as f.ex. the duet with Frankie Gaye (Marvin's brother) ""Once Upon A Time"" is very cheapsounding and not standing the test of time. The original material varies somewhat in quality too - ""Walk The City Streets"" is far too racy to do her much justice, ""You're The Answer To My Dreams"" is a much better dance track as is ""Stop Before It's Too Late"". The slower ""Hold On A Little Longer"" and the title track of the original 1990 album ""Keeping My Mind On Love"" is sultry and delightful. All in all, it's worth a buy and on this collection you'll find all the 12"" versions included. (Sren Jensen)"
3,Warning: This product shrinks when washed!,"I originally bought this hamper in blue. Of the three stars I have given this hamper, 1 star is for the attractive design and 2 stars are for the really great mesh bag, which does make transporting baby's dirty laundry to the washing machine very easy, but I must let you know that this hamper shrinks when washed! The washing instructions say it is machine washable and it is attached to the wooden frame by velcro so that it can come off for cleaning. I followed the specific instructions on the label, but when it came out of the dryer it was two inches shorter and would not fit on the wooden frame. Not only that but the fabric was completely worn out.In spite of this, I have ordered another one (this time in pink), because I really love the look and size of this hamper. I guess I will just have to be more careful about keeping it clean, and I'll hand wash it next time around."
5,"This is my soul companion, the best gift I've ever received","Journey Into Motherhood is my soul companion, spiritual midwife, and dream catcher. Each time I open its pages, I am stimulated, comforted, and gently nudged into focusing upon the miracle of generation and birth, to laugh at and feel fellowship about my fears, large and small, and most importantly, to re-enter into the pure power and majesty of motherhood. Leslie Kirk Campbell challenges and heartens us, sharing an oracle of wisdom both ancient and contemporary, heartrending and inspiring, practical and poetic: her own unique, wholly embraceable, extremely empowering vision of motherhood. Her book accompanies me to every baby shower...it is one of the most useful gifts I have ever received, and I am definitely passing it on. Thank you, Leslie Kirk Campbell, for giving so generously of your special brand of lucid, humorous honesty and of your very sage, very fine, very full mother's spirit!"
5,Strollometer - GREAT product!,"I love the strollometer. It works great - I have it on the Phil and Ted e3. The information seems very accurate and its so easy to use. It motivates me to walk because I can see the results right as I'm doing it. I can set a goal to walk three miles and its easy to track - as well as my speed. I love that it has the temperature too. Also, customer service through Strollometer.com is amazing. I misplaced one of the brackets and they replaced it free, which is awesome. I highly recommend this product for ANY new mom for use on ANY stroller."
5,"Saw it, love it!","I saw this at my Mom stroller-fitness class and had to have it. It's a great product that not only motivates me, but seems to motivate the other moms around me, too! It was easy to install on the inside of my wheel and there's a great ""cheat sheet"" for my Phil & Teds that I got off the Strollometer website. The features are cool, but what makes me feel really good is looking at the total distance I strolled during the day. I recommend it to anyone with a stroller!"
2,Could be attached better,"The display works well, when it gets a signal from the transmitter. The problem is the way the transmitter attaches to the frame of the stroller. Every time we use the stroller we have to readjust the transmitter so it doesn't rub against the wheel. I will most likely have to make something to mount to the frame of the running stroller. I have a different brand of speedometer/odometer for a bike and the zip tie attachment is much more secure."
2,I Gave Up On It,"I was very excited upon first receiving this item, however soooo disappointed after trying to use it for quite some time. The batteries needed to be replaced quite frequently and the reader on the wheel was constantly getting pushed out of alignment anytime I went up or down aisles, in and out of doorways, or going through checkout counters at the grocery store. I finally gave up and have yet to find anything else."
4,Strollometer - great purchase!,I bought this for our new jog stroller and it has been great! This strollometer helps me keep track of how far I've walked/run so I know how much exercise I am getting. It also tracks average mph and has a clock. I would recommend this product. The only drawback is that it was a little complicated to install on the stroller and I don't think you can move it from 1 stroller to another very easily.
2,Great idea - Wish it worked,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she was thrilled since she loves her bike odomenter and was interested in one for her stroller. Unfortunately, we had nothing but problems, from the computer contact not working (needed to have a 2nd one shipped to us) to the magnet not staying in position so it could record the wheel revolutions, to our toddler very easily ripping the sensor off the stroller, to the computer consistently freezing up on us. We are bummed to have sent our back and asked for a refund. Customer service was always great, but they couldn't fix the problems."
4,Works great but magnet falls off too easily,"I've been using the strollometer for a few days and I will admit that it works great. I live in NYC and have always wondered how much walking we really do in one day. I especially like the time and temp. reading. It's easy to install and set up. The only thing is that the magnet can easily be knocked off either by accidently kicking it off, or more commonly, by the sensor itself if and when it is pushed or kicked too close to the wheel. As the wheel turns, the magnet just gets clipped right off by the sensor when it gets close enough. I just repositioned the sensor to the inside of the wheel to see if it helps. I've already gone thru 2 magnets (the kit comes with 3). Otherwise, I recommend it."
2,Worked for 3 months,"I have a BOB ironman sport utility stroller deluxe. I installed the computer and sensor and the unit worked fine for a month or two. I did not like the flexible mount (which wobbled) nor the rubber strap that attached to the stroller. I put it on as tight as I could and the thing still rotated to the point where I would have to stop and adjust it because it stopped recording.Then the computer stopped working one day, I thought I had left it out in the sun too long, because it was fine the next day. Then a week later it turned off again, and now it's on but I can't seem to make it do anything but show the wrong time. I'd return it if I could. But I waited too long."
2,Great.. if the magnet would stay on,"I ordered this product about 4 months ago. I followed the instructions very carefully to attach the magnet. I thought it was odd that it would just ""stick"" to the wheel. I cleaned the tire with the the alcohol pad, I was careful not to touch the sticky side when I removed the backing, i attached it to the wheel and held it there for a while... still, once around the block and the magnet was lost for good.I tried to superglue the magnet. I cleaned the wheel again and glued it... no success... I've now been through 2 of the 3 magnets. I am going to try epoxy for the last magnet; if that doesn't work, nothing will!It worked well, before the magnet fell off. I can see why people would really like this thing and become ""addicted"" to it. I really liked the display and all the functions. It really did make walking fun.. for the block or two that it worked."
4,Great training tool for serious runners with wee ones,"I am a serious runner with a one year old and a BOB Ironman jogging stroller. When I first got the Strollometer, disappointment was my first reaction. I run at a pace between 7 and 9 mph which can cause some vibration to the sensor arm. Speed also was registering in 0.9 mph increments. I tried making a few adjustments without much success. Instead of giving up I contacted Adi at Strollometer who helped work these kinks out. First, she suggested I loop the sensor arm to cut down on vibration. This worked well. Next, to increase accuracy to 0.3 mph increments 2 additional magnets were added to the wheel and the unit was recalibrated to 1/3 of the wheel diameter. Adi was very helpful in resolving these issues and even sent additional magnets out. Works great now. I'd rate it a 4.5 if that was possible."
4,Opinion pending...,"I received my Strollometer for my birthday and am very excited to use it. Unfortunately, I didn't even get the thing installed before two of the three magnets were already off. I have a Graco Quattro Tour Deluxe Travel System stroller and there just doesn't seem to be a good place to place the sensor. Each time I folded up the stroller to make sure it wouldn't move the sensor, it bent it in some way and knocked off the magnet. :( So, although I still have the magnets, I am not sure if I can re-stick them as the glue seems to be weakened already. I have managed to get the third magnet stuck on and have programmed the computer, both things done with relative ease. I have also emailed ""Adi"" to inquire as to whether she might suggest placing the magnet in a different spot on my particular wheel and whether she might be able to send more magnets since it appears they are inevitably going to fall off and be lost. We'll see what happens next..."
4,"Good, but not perfect","Simple to install, and generally a joy to use. I love knowing how far I've walked with my son while pushing him in the stroller (especially since, like most new moms, I've got a little extra poundage to lose) but I'm already on my last magnet (the Strollometer comes with 3), despite following the instructions carefully. (Yes, I wiped the spot down with the alcohol wipe!) I also had to duck tape the sensor so it wouldn't move around while the stroller bounced along bumpy sidewalks. But considering this is the only product for this purpose (nevermind that it also comes with so many great features: time! temperature! distance! and an option to measure in metric, too!) and it works well most of the time, I'll give it 4 stars. If my problems were addressed, I'd give the product 5 stars!"
4,Baby walking,Great to use when helping to lose the baby weight. I took my baby out walking quite a bit right after delivery and it was nice for me to be able to track my progress.
4,Love it for the summer,"I had some difficulties at first with the strollometer. But after contacting ""9 Months Up, 9 Months Down"" I am very pleased with this product. We have bumpy sidewalks here and for whatever reason I had difficulties getting the sensor to pick up the magnet. The customer service I received was great and in only a short time everything seems to be in working order."
1,Does not work on the bugaboo Bee,I was so excited about the prospect of knowing how far I'm walking every day. However with the Bugaboo Bee the magnet piece will not stay on the wheel. I went through all three magnets provided in 2 days and now have no way of using this device. If you don't have a stroller with large wheels with ample flat surface don't buy this product!
1,Great in Theory,"I was so excited to get the Strollometer as a shower gift. Unfortunately, it never worked for more than a week. Here are the issues:- the sensor that attaches near the wheel moved every time we went over a bumpy sidewalk, road or curb, as well as when loading in and out of the car. regularly, it would knock off the magnet on the wheel, so it couldn't read any more.- the battery life was really short. the founder said that it's because the unit constantly measures temperature. my bicycle computers have batteries that last for 2 years with constant use, yet this battery died after 1 month of use.- there is no odometer, just a trip odometer. in other words, all your data is erased every night at midnight, so you can't track how far or fast you went over the past week, month, etc.Overall, the reliability issues caused me to return it. 5 stars to Giggle for excellent customer service -- They tried personally to fix it three times and then refunded it when I gave up."
4,great idea,I love all of the different features this has. The downfall is that sometimes when I fold up my stroller I tend to bump or move the arm that is supposed to be next to the sensor. I have to reset it each time I start a new walk after unfolding the stroller. Going over a large bump may jarr it away from the sensor too. I use on sidewalks so not really a problem but if used for heavier terrain it may not be so great unless you keep an eye on it and notice when it resets itself or your readings will be wrong at the end of the trip! I noticed after going off of a curb that it jarred away just enough to reset the trip info.
5,Perfect!,"This is a great product, and only wish I had gotten one sooner!I have an InStep Safari TT double jogging stroller, and installation was a breeze. It works great, I just make sure the sensor is the right distance from the magnet before you get going. After being folded up or stored, sometimes it can get knocked out of place, but you just bend it back and you're off!I used this at Disney and I brought the part that attaches to the handlebar into the rides so it wouldn't be stolen, and then just popped it back on when we got out. The stroller averaged 4.5 miles a day, and I know we walked more than that!I LOVE the fact that it shows the temperature!"
3,Great... when it works,"This thing is such a pain in the rear. The arm that attaches to the wheel gets bent and out of alignment every time you fold your stroller and the magnet has come off so many times that I ran out of replacements. When it works, it is great to have, but 90% of the time it is just acting as an overpriced handlebar clock. Might be good if you never collapse your stroller, but not suitable for everyday wear and abuse of a foldable stroller that gets tossed in and out of the truck."
5,we love it,"A great product. My wife and I are both triathletes who obsess about our running pace and distance, so I wanted to be able to measure those when running with the stroller. The Strollometer works great with our BOB."
1,Do not buy!,"Within one week the strap snapped, the calibrating head came off - therefore the unit was completely useless.During the one week the unit worked - the unit needs turning on for every journey (even return leg). So, if you forget to turn on the unit, you don't get a recording.As a product design the calibration head sticks out significantly over the wheel. This makes the head susceptible to being knocked as you take the stroller in and out of doorways.Better option I think is to buy a pedometer which can be put in a bag."
1,Not working after 1 week,"I loved the item for one week. Then it ceased to work. I threw out the box and hope that I can return it for a new one. If it works, its great. Hope I just got a bum one! I just wish that the wheel guage didn't move as easily as it does because after folding up my jogger sometimes it moves and I have to adjust it so it doesn't hit my wheel."
2,Price is Misleading,"When I saw the original price according to Amazon ($300) and the selling price(39.99), I thought I am getting a great deal and a great product. In fact the set does not worth even a $50. The quality is poor, it looks nice but the material is of low quality, thin cloth, less filling, poor stiching. The color in the picture is also misleading, its kind of pinkish in the picture but actually its brown.So if you are buying, don't expect the quality of a $300 comforter, it just worth $30-40"
4,"Wonderful, but not quite the best of I had hoped","Some great material truly shines on this album, but I wsih that the group had been a little less populist in their choice of repertoire. There is a little too many arrangements and folk-like material, with the exception of the wonderful ""Dulaman"", and I would like to have heard some more varied repertoire. That said this is an excellent starting point for this amazing group."
4,Good Overall Sample,"I've been a fan of Chanticleer since early in their career. I like them better when they stick to pre-classical music. There is something about the adult male soprano voice that does not sit well with me. It's too shrill, or harsh, or something. Boy sopranos are another story. The adult male soprano voice is great in pre-classical stuff, because it was probably written for castratas. Regardless, Chanticleer is always a treat."
5,A Re-Reader,"This is an excellant book worthy of a re-read. It portrays Allied and Nazi soldiers not as cookie cutter good and bad guys, but as people with their own virtues and faults. As good a story as Saving Private Ryan."
5,Terrific,This rug is a good deal for the price. It is thin but all wool and very soft. The color is darker than the pictures-it is maroon. I grew up with rugs from the far east and this reminds me of the antique ones I grew up with. Fast delivery! Got it in two days! I am very happy with this rug!
1,Sheds like crazy,"I purchased this rug twice and had to return it twice. It sheds like crazy. I returned the first rug becasue I thought it was defective and ordered another. Same problem with the second rug. I had to return that one as well. This was not your average garden variety wool rug shedding--This was where after one day, balls/clumps of tufts and red fibers were on the floors of every room in my home; and believe me it was unsightly and a headache to clean up. I'am surprised no one else has mentioned this issue with this rug."
3,N.O.T. TOO Bad,"This certainly isn't a HORRIBLE album, but it lacks something. Don't know what it is, but It isn't on this album. I'd say that the only song on this album that caught my attention would be ""Nothin'"", probably because I saw the video on MTV. Besides that, well, nothin'. I'll give this album 3 stars because the style might strike some people (isn't to my liking) which might be enough to sell this album. Almost every song features a hit rapper, so if you're into that, you MIGHT wanna check it out. Later."
1,Is this guy kidding me ?,"Noreaga...is straight up wack. I haven't wrote any reviews saying bad stuff about an artist but I have to on this one. This is just bad. Even though his previous works are wack, the lyrics were darn funny. It made no sense. On GODS FAVORITE, his rhymes aren't funny anymore. He is just wack. He has always been wack. And the beats are wack. Please don't support this. Worst song on this album : Mr. CEO !!"
2,Noreaga can't flow anymore.......,"He is not near the old Noreaga of the War Report and it is getting worse with each album he drops. His beats alone can make a good album worth listening to, but his lyrics are lazy like someone else said, he just doesn't really say anything on the microphone anymore that moves me (He says alot of stupid things for that matter). If you like commercialism with no real meaning to the lyrics you will enjoy this album because of the beats, but the lyrics are just blah. He needs Capone by his side on every album now, he is the best one out of the two and has some really tight thugged out lyrics. With Capone and other guests he is listenable, but with him and some whack guests on the albums I just can't bare it, period."
4,Beauty and the Beast meet Captain Kirk!,"One of Kirk's kissing episodes. The Beauty is Sherry Jackson as Andrea, an android pinup, and the Beast is Ted Cassidy as Rouk. My favorite scene is when Kirk kisses Andrea to show her what a kiss really is! Earlier in the episode, Dr. Korby told Kirk she had no feelings and told Andrea to kiss him. So, she gave him a small kiss on the lips. But later, Kirk lands a massive wet one on her. After the kiss, She says, ""Not programmed for you.""."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"This album is total crap and should be avoided at all costs. In fact anything that Ian Levine has had a hand in should be treated like the plague. The Marvelettes were a wonderful Motown group who disbanded in 1970 and were IMHO very misguided in agreeing to make this appalling record. It sounds like it was recorded in a garden shed with a drum machine & a computer. It's sounds as much like the Marvelettes as I would. Please, please, please don't buy this record but instead seek out any of the girls Motown or Spectrum collections for the real thing."
3,USA Airborne: 50th Anniversary,"My husband loved the information in the book but was very disappointed with the condition of the book we received. The book had many blank pages and pages that where folded in half and sewed into the bind, we ended up sending the book back, promised we would receive a new book just to find out that the book is no longer in print and we cannot find another book. This was a very disappointing purchase."
1,It's not what you see on the picture,"I thought it was a shoe organizer with three shelves, like on the picture. Instead, I received an incomplete set of only three shelves and no sidewalls to attach them to. I am returning it."
2,Waterd Down Scent,"My favorite perfume that was discontinued so I was happy to find it here at a reasonable price. It was packaged in the original box and bottle but the scent is not as potent/adhering or fresh as the original scent. It's a soft scent that would stay on my body all day with a small squirt. This perfume here fades fast by the time I walk out the door, the scent is gone. I used to spray once and the scent would stay on my wrists all day even after washing my hands...it's very disappointing. I thought I got a good deal for the same quality perfume but I was wrong.Next time, I will stick with Perfumebay which costs more but the scent is the original and lasts all day and night. I chose Amazon because I've purchased so many other quality products and thought this one would be the same."
5,Great book for assessment class!,"This book by Ganellen is an excellent resource for two of the personality assessment classes I teach at the graduate level. Integrating MMPI-2 and Rorschach findings is a critical aspect of good assessment, and this book is an outstanding resource in helping the reader effectively integrate the two instruments. It uses well-selected and instructive cases to highlight the processes involved. I would recommend it highly to anyone interested in this topic--for teaching or for practicing psychological assessment. A must read. Hale Martin, Ph.D."
2,Not so great for integrating,"This book has more case studies than useful chapters for learning how to integrate the Rorschach and MMPI. The case studies do all the work for you instead of leading you through it or allowing you to do it for yourself. Not useful for my assessment course, I felt."
1,function of weather vane stake,"I am totally dissatisfied with this stake. Even after applying WD40 to lubricate the spinning, nothing on this works. I have purchased several of these type stakes and at a much lower price that spin and do just fine. This is an ugly piece ofjunk, not worth the money. Dont buy it. CMc"
1,Bad attitude,"Buy your Obagi products elsewhere. This seller who calls herself Cosmetic Lady from Estetica is very unprofessional. I received the product later than I have with any other Amazon purchase regardless of a holiday that was involved, which she tried to blame it on. But her attitude was repulsive. She was rude, curt and totally defensive and unprofessional in addressing this issue. Save yourselves the trouble and get your Obagi products elsewhere."
1,Never got product,"Never received product. I called to let them know. They basically told me ""I dont know what to tell you. We mailed it."" I basically had no choice but to eat the cost. I will never order from them again."
2,dont recommend...,"this product came highly recommended on makeupalley.com. i purchased it and immediately slathered it on. it is a gel texture and comes with a plastic spatula applicator. i didnt feel a thing-not even a tingle. next day, PIMPLE! tried it again the following week-same results. this might be good for people with very dry skin and who are new to acids. wont be repurchasing..."
1,NOT the real ELGINS,"For people wondering why hits like Darling Baby and Put Yourself In My Place aren't on this collection, well it shouldn't matter, since these are NOT the original recordings and this is NOT the original lineup that featured the fantastic Saundra Edwards.Most of the Elgins original recordings, including all of their singles, were made available on the Belgian label Marginal a few years ago as part of THE ELGINS VS THE MONITORS (another underappreciated Motown group that made some great recordings). Look for that out of print gem or purchase the Big Hits & Hard To Find Classics series (British imports) to get their hit singles (Darling Baby and Heaven Must Have Sent You on Volume 1, Put Yourself In My Place and Stay In My Lonely Arms on Volume 3, the non-hit single It's Been A Long Long Time on Volume 4)."
4,"A NICE C.D. BUT MISSING ""DARLING BABY""","ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS AS I WAS GROWING UP WAS ""DARLING BABY"" BY THE ELGINS. WHEN I SAW THAT THEY HAD A ""GREATEST HITS"" C.D.OUT, I WAS OVERWHELMED( UNTIL I REALIZED THAT THE SONG HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED.)I STILL ORDERED IT AND LIKED IT, BUT IT WAS LIKE BUYING THE SUPERBS WITHOUT ""BABY, BABY ALL THE TIME"".COME ON!!IN ANY CASE DO ENJOY THIS C.D. BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SOME NICE SURPRIZES.THEY PROBABLY COULDN'T GET THE RIGHTS FROM MOTOWN.THERE'S GOT TO BE A GOOD LOGIC.BUY IT ANYWAYS!"
5,Great Service,"The book I recieved was in great condition. I also receaved it in good timing to, under the predicted time."
1,Seller review,"This unfortunately is not a product review yet.....I will submit a ""product"" review when I actually receive the product. The seller on the other hand list this product as being ""in-stock"" but don't let that fool you. I placed an order over 2 weeks ago and still have not received the product. I got a response via an email I sent explaining that they had a major run on these and were waiting for stock replenishment but have sent subsequent emails that haven't been responded to. They are definitely not ""in-stock"" and the original estimated delivery was 2-5 days and it's been 14. Not happy at all with the customer service here and so far haven't been offered any incentive to ever do business with these folks again once this transaction is finally complete."
4,weathervane,"I think it needs to be up higher to catch a light wind better, but for now I like the way it looks, and that's enough."
1,Quit working after a month!,"Bought two of these products, one for me and one for a gift. Mine stopped working in about a month. The gifted item stopped working after 6 weeks."
3,Somewhat buggy,Great value because it pays for itself but after a while it starts to get buggy. This is the 2nd one I've owned and they both do the same thing. After a while they start to tell you dead batteries are full. You load it up then after a few minute it starts to BLINK. I have to charge them one at a time. It's on and off. Totally depends on the day. But its still a time / money saver
4,Battery recharger,The product works great as described. I use these rechargeable battery for both my digital camera and xbox controllers.
2,"OK for infrequent use, can kill batteries","Bought this as an upgrade to the standard energizer slow charger. Initially it was great, but over time found similiar issues that other people have had. It's very picky, it will reject batteries that the old charger would not. Plus I've found that repeated use of this charger will cause the batteries to take less and less of a charge until they're only lasting a couple of hours after charging.Overall, it's good when you have to quickly charge up 4 batteries for your camera before you leave for a party. But other than that, stay away."
3,Decent charger,"I learned that you have to let the batteries stay in for an extra 10 mins after the green light shows for a full charge. It sometimes ""refuses"" good batteries. One feature that I hate is the batteries fit so firmly in the charging station that it sometimes damages the batteries taking them out."
1,Disappointed at not receiving a world-traveller adapter,"The product in itself is good and useful but only to those that travel within the US.I bought this 'Rapid' charger for the reason that we travel a lot, all around the world and the voltage is 240 V in many countries. Often, when traveling there isn't enough time to charge camera cells for 4-8 hours as required by traditional chargers. So, this 15-30 minute charger is a boon in such cases.But, this one was shipped with a US only adapter(CH15MN2-ADP-US - 100-127 V). Though Energizer also manufactures a world traveller adapter(CH15MN2-ADP-CA - 100-240 V) for this set of recharger, it is shipped only in Canada.This should have been mentioned in the description of the product."
1,Red light flashes alot,"Worked great for a few months, now I get a lot of flashing red lights indicating a problem with a cell. Out of the first 4 cells, one was rejected form the charger. A week later a second cell was rejected. Instead of buying new NIMH batteries every three months I bought a different brand of charger and the cells that this unit won't charge will charge fine in the new one. Can't recommend this Energizer charger."
2,HARD TO CHARGE,The charger red light flashes a lot. Requiring repositioning of batteries often. A real pain.
1,A Piece of Junk,DO NOT BUY. The red light always flashes which tells you there is a problem with one or more of the batteries. The machine worked fine the first time I used it and after that only flashing red lights. I put the same batteries in my 8 hour charger and there was no problem.I wish I had saved the packaging so I could return it. I used Energizer batteries and made sure everything was clean. Don't waste your money!!!!
5,"Green, green, green","I think everyone should use rechargeable for their game console, rc cars that need constant new batteries. I know it is still little bit too expensive."
1,"Rejects many batteries, even its own.","I have had this charger for exactly 5 months. I was a bit disappointed with it from the start as it refused to charge my older batteries. I didn't worry too much because I knew they were a couple of years old and got rid of them. Today, it refused to charge the two AA batteries that came with it.There is absolutely no reason to buy this charger. As far as the total ownwership cost goes, you may be better off by getting a 40-pack of Alkalines for $10 when they are available on sale. Those are always ready for use. No need to wait even 15 minutes for a recharge and overpay for rechargeables that don't recharge."
4,Better than the prevous one,"Well, i bought this one as a replacement of theEnergizer 15-Minute Battery Charger], it just stop working after 2 years of barely use (maybe 2 o 3 times per month) anyway, i wanted a fast charger, read about the [[ASIN:B000FGGG34 Duracell 15 Minute Battery Chargerbut what i saw didnt convince me, so i went for this one, less noisy (what is not a problem to me), same LED for all batteries and a little slower i think (wich is good for batteries life) with the prevoius one i got the problem of dead batteries after some recharges, i hope this one fix that or no so often at least"
1,1400mAh not 2300mAh.....,"The charger actually comes with 4 batteries like the description says. On the downside, they are 1400mAh not 2300mAh like in the picture shown. The charger is spot on, but then again, I'm sure 1400mAh will charge a lot faster than 2300. Good luck getting accurate batteries like the ones shown in the picture."
2,BURNS UP BATTERIES,"We have used this charger for about a year. I guess we were slow to figure out that the super fast charges are not good for rechargable batteries. We have 30 to 50 rechargable batteries for outside lights and a camera and so on. What tipped us off to this thing cooking our batteries was discovering that the 4 sets of batteries we carry in one of the camera bags, just were always dead when we went to use that camera. Then we read about over charging, even the 2850mah ones just lost life and would not hold a normal charge. So the price of the quick charge may cost you for shorter battery life. The sad thing is we paid $50 at Staples for ours.It works great but is just too much for the batteries. Sorry for typos, using the tablet."
2,Doesn't work very Well,"The batteries do not last as long as they say they do. It really is a ""30-minute"" charger if you read the packaging. The packaging actually says that to have the best charge, let it charge for 30 minutes. When you let it charge for the 15 minutes like it advertises, the batteries do not last long at all. I do not recommend this product. I'd much rather have a one-hour charger that I know will charge the batteries like it is supposed to!"
1,These are terrible! Forget winter use,"I bought these to replace some Rayovac 15 minute rechargables that were 10 years old. First of all I fully charged these (for many hours as required) and no matter which pair I put into my GPS, it was showing up as only partially charged. I used them today for a winter ski trip. We were only gone 2 hours and it wasn't even that cold (maybe 30 degrees F). The batteries were dead by the time we got back to the car. My Rayovacs would last for >6 hours in minus zero temperatures. These are a waste of money and I am really sorry I bought the hype about them. Do yourself a favor and get something else, especially if you want to use them in temperatures below room temperature."
1,Worst- Waste of time and money,"I bought this 15 minutes Energizer charger from Amazon even after looking at some of the bad reviews.From reviews I thought maybe few people got bad piece which is common. I thought i will get a good one. Looks like only few people get good piece. I also got the one where the charger blinks red light after few seconds when you plug in the charger for charging. The camera shows the batteries are out of charge after charging the batteries with red light blinking.I know it's 10$ less at Amazon for this product but what is the use of buying a product which is notworking at 10$ less. I've decided not to buy electronics online any more. Stay away from this product.Maybe they have all the old stock, and i heard that old batteries don't get charged."
1,It killed my batteries,"This item charges your batteries fast but they're never the same again. My batteries that have put in this charger now last 1/4 of the time they used to, and lose power very quickly even when not being used.Save yourself the expense of buying new batteries and use the slow charger, the fast charger is not worth it."
2,Surprisingly Disappointing Charger,"Pro: This charger really does charge batteries in 15 minutes. Pretty cool... But...Cons:At first, this charger worked great. But after the first few weeks, the charger began to reject perfectly good batteries (including quite a few very new 2500mAH ENERGIZER brand batteries, so compatibility can't be the issue here.) Overall, it seems to accept about half the batteries I feed it, and then, it charges them only abouth half-way, as far as I can tell. I've bought two of these chargers and both have the same problem. From other reviews on this page, I see that I'm not alone in my experience.Obviously not everyone has had these problems here, but my own experience is very negative (2 defective chargers) If you choose to buy this charger, it may be a bit of a gamble... so I would strongly recommend registering your charger to enable you to get an exchange/refund in case you get one of the many lemons they seem to be shipping out."
4,Energizer 15 minute charger,"This is a good product. It charged the included 2300ma batteries in the advertised 15 minutes plus an additional, optional 10 minutes to ""top it off"". The charger and the fan shut off automatically so there was no need to ""babysit"" the charger. Also, I charged 4 3500ma batteries in the same amount of time. I love the lifetime warranty for the charger and the included Energizer batteries. The only fault I have with the product is that it doesn't accept 240 volts for international usage. I didn't find out until after I purchased this that Sony has a 15 minute charger that automatically adapts to 240 volts. I would have purchased it instead as I travel regularly out of the country.Overall this is a great product."
3,Moody,"I agree with at least one review on this charger's tendency to be a bit picky. I'll say first that I love the speed with which this charger works when it does accept a battery. The batteries heat up and there is an odd smell, but the built in fan gives some piece of mind. I've never quantified how long it takes for these batteries to die, but they all experience heavy use in our household with kids, light-sensing devices, digital camera etc. and I prefer repeated use and charging to adding more junk to our landfill. It IS IMPORTANT, however, to have a regular slow backup charger for those batteries it refuses to accept (red charger light blinks to indicate it doesn't like a battery)."
4,Just Another Teen Movie?,"It is known to many, that to find a good teen movie, you must look further than the video shelves of your local Video Hire. Sure, there is 'Pretty In Pink', 'The Breakfast Club' and more recently 'Get Over It', but they all rely on the love triangle's to boost thier plot. 'The Night Before' is different, not only in the conventional, but the unconventional. Creating laughs from the twisted love match of Reeves & Loughlin, the seedy going-ons that run the streets at night, to slapstick escapades that adorn the closing sequences. This is a must for any lover of films, or the Weird and Wonderful that fill studio backlists to the brim. Deleted in the UK, buy quick from America, a minor masterpiece of Hollywood legends."
4,Definitely a Guilty Pleasure-Keanu Reeves in the 80's hard to resist,"Cheesy, but still a cute and funny 80's flick, I just had to own. Love Keanu Reeve's dance scene- still makes me giggle."
3,Not an Oscar winner... but fun!,Just a fun movie with a very young Keaneau Reeves. Lori Loughlin is also in it. I always liked her. Wish Hollywood would have had sense enough to put her in more movies.Basically about a prom night that goes really bad. Good laughs and cameos.I waited a LONG time for this to be release on DVD. Was worth the wait.
5,The Best Curl Creme,"This product is expensive, but worth the price. The large bottle lasts a long time, and the product creates beautiful curls. Nothing else I've used has worked so well."
4,Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild by THQ,"I feel it is a good action game, but due to high cost, people would think twice before buying it. Better try it first. I cannot say much about this game as I have not played it, but I have played many other games full of fun for price half of this game."
4,Splashdown Rides gone wild,I played Splashdown Rides Gone Wild at my best freinds house and I loved it I wanted it so badly I did fourteen chores in a day to earn it the next day. And that is a big deal to me becuase I usually only get one chore done in a week! My mom left like an hour ago to go buy it and I can't wait till she comes home and I can play it!
4,"Good, Clean, Fun","This game is good, clean, fun. There is a language caution but there is not any cursing in the game. I suggest any child six(if very mauture.If not I suggest wait till seven.) or older can play the game. This game is like riding on a speedboat through a themepark."
4,Fair book for beginners,"This book is helpful for someone who knows very little-nothing about German language. It touches on culture, and is a nice source book for learning German. However, if the reader knows basics of the German language, I would recommend a different book. This is a nice great book for the clueless. :o)"
2,Not good,"This is basically just an oversized traveller's phrase book. Not much info on grammar, syntax, very little vocabulary. It does have a very good pronunciation guide. But not recommended."
3,Not entirely accurate,"I spent two weeks in Germany on a publicity tour for my 3rd book from Parthas Verlag [...] and liked the section on spelling your name and phone calls. Didn't have enough time to do more prep. from this book, but I have to say that the book is wrong about how people answer phones. Only at businesses do they announce their names when they pick up--everyone else just says ""Hallo?"" That's based on hearing countless ""handy"" calls received in restaurants, trains and other public places."
1,beware of the fineprint,"This book did help me learn some things and it helped me understand some other things that I didn't get before which is wht this book gets 1 star. However this book is full of mistakes like translations that I know to be wrong because I have studied some German before getting this book. When I find a bunch of mistakes it makes me wonder how many other mistakes are there that I'm not aware of so I lost my trust in this book and found a better one.All the teach yourself books have a few mistakes here and there but this one has way too many so I would highly suggest that you find a better book than this one if you're looking to learn German, especialy for a begginer."
4,Fun Game,Our 4/5 year old loves this game and the whole family gets involved. Good price and quick service. The only criticism is that the pictures/colors on the cards make it a little difficult to match the pairs but that is a minor annoyance. Great family fun.
3,Not strong enough for me,I have used Kenra's extra strong hairspray for years and I love it. But I tried some of the medium spray and liked the scent better. I have VERY straight hair and use a volumizing mousse and curling iron followed by hair spray. I gave it a shot but it literally fell flat in a few hours. This spray is probably good for someone with some body to their hair; it's just not strong enough for mine.
5,Kenra Medium Spray,"I really like this hair spray. Medium hold, with no stiffness. Leaves hair soft and manageable. I can also use my blow dryer later if I need to touch up the style."
3,I goofed,I bought the wrong size tire. I didn't know there were different size tires on WEBER Grills. BE AWARE !
2,Not great,I like her voice in later recordings. this one sounds like ho-hum Motown. Don't care to hear it a second time.
1,never got mine either...,"Do not buy from this seller. The CD is GREAT! But I NEVER got the CD from this seller. It's been about 3 months...so I don't think I'm getting it. I did however get some movie called Grizzly Park. Which I'm not gonna watch. GREAT MUSIC, BAD SELLER!"
1,Not a very useful book,"I don't recommend this book, except if you're interested in learning about how the area around the park was formed a long time ago. Otherwise, this book is of no help on a trip to Glacier."
2,i can't believe this passed as a maxi-single,"this might as well have been sold for the price of a regualr 2-track single, there is such a limited amount of content. I've actually boughten CD singles that contained 4 tracks or more (even some with remixes) that were considered ""regualr"" singles. Maxi-Singles should always have remixes. I can't believe that ""You'll See"" got a maix-single full of the same track in 3 variations of the album versio + 1 live track, yet ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"" had some AMAZING remixes commisioned for it YET did not receive a maxi! ""You'll See"" is a great song, but this single is LACKING."
3,all right,The Spanish version of You'll See was a staple for drag queens in latin clubs in NYC to lip sync to when this first came out. I think it's better than the English version.The live version of Live To Tell is dredful. It's from Who's That Girl tour. Why did they pick that one? is what I wanna know. She's done 2 other tours before this single and I think? there is a better ballad performance by her somewhere. Maybe the Oh Father/Live To Tell medley from Blond Ambition.Get this ONLY if you want to hear her sing in Spanish and/or if you want to sing karaoke.
1,still not shipped,Order is 7 days old and son's text book hasn't even shipped. Received no reply to email.
4,Definitely a classic in a series,"The Misturada series is definitely a sleeper. This is one for the mature crowd, the agiing Hip-hopper, or the aging Junglist. As for me, I personally bought this album because I follow 4Hero's (Dego) work wherever I can. This is one you can put on and please anyone who is open to listening to the progression of Jazz, Hip-hop, and Jungle. Great chill and lounge music."
2,Disappointing,"The title, ""The Basics and Beyond"" is a misnomer. In no way does Brozman cover any lap slide basics. If you already play lap slide in another format, this dvd may be helpful in learning blues style slide but if you are a slide beginner or even intermediate, pass on it. It provides no exercises, no basic material to work on--it goes right to advanced level playing. In my opinion, Brozman is not a very good teacher--he goes over stuff to fast in too little detail, provides no connective material or exercises. He's a fine musician, he just can't teach. Maybe this dvd will be useful to me someday but not now."
4,sixteen candles,"I love this poster, it seems diverse to me. and it says alot with just legwarmers and ballet shoes. Also...its in the movie sixteen candles!!!! its hanging on samantha's(molly ringwald) wall! in the scene when shes looking in the mirror in her room. :)"
5,Profane-Provocative-Pulsating-Prophetic,"Jew Girl reverberates with the pulse of New York City post 09.11. Written in the words of the City-the words of the Street-EminemsRevenge draws the reader into the lives of Darla, Darla, Dora and Eileen for one day as they prepare to receive a shipment of boxcars from China and for Eileen's death; while Eileen's son, Reuven, weaves through with a magic begotten by a young christ exploring the truisms of the East in the twenty first century. Prepare to have your ideas about ""everythang"" challenged and strap in for the read of your life."
3,PURPLE is good.,Got this one from Fry's and it's still in good condition but it's only good for WinXP or earlier.
2,Bait and switch,"The version of ""25 Miles"" is not the one that was a hit and is in fact horrible -- disco-ed up or something. A real disappointment that made me chuck the disc. Where the hell is the great version that I've heard on the radio?"
4,Poet and the Rent,"This play is a lot of fun. It was written for adults to perform for kids, so alot of the humor can be funnier to parents than to their kids. But what good kids' show doesn't add a little subtle adult humor a la Muppet Show variety?Mamet's wit shines through such characters as Kodiak Prince, The Wonder Dog, who is the canine sidekick of Sargent Preston. This character's entire vocabulary consists of various forms of barking. Not to mention Mamet's integration of slapstick as just about every character in the show manages to throw a cream pie at Auntie Georgie.""Poet"" contains plenty of running gags, interesting characters, strange plot twist. It is a wonderful play. It a much more fun to see it being performed than to sit and read it. What good play isn't?I would recommend it for a group of kids looking for a challenge or a group of adults just looking for some fun."
2,candle scent,only enough scent for two small candles.......will order larger size next time so I can make more than two candles.
2,Low budget VHS release transferred to DVD,"My girlfriend loves orchids and likes to learn more about taking care of them. Since this is about the only DVD on the subject I could find, I went for it. Since there aren't any reviews I thought it would be worth helping people understand what this is. Even though it's burned on to a dvd-r, it's clearly transferred from a VHS tape. The audio is terrible, the graphics and visual transitions are laughable. I can't say the advice is bad but the production is lacking for sure considering the price. Amazon should discount this or be more up front about the quality."
4,Orchid Care Basics DVD,"Sir, this DVD is not a Hollywood Production I understand and appreciate your feedback. However, I believe the content itself to be extremely valuable for the beginner. I assure you the video was not transferred from a VHS. The audio is fine, it was recorded inside my Greenhouse and I could not eliminate some of the background noise due to Greenhouse equipment operating but had never had anyone indicate the audio was unsatisfactory."
1,Self Punishment in a Box... Avoid this game...,"EQ2 is a game that makes you want to set your computer on fire and kill your self, over and over.Pros:1. Nice GraphicsCons:1. Long load times2. Forced grouping3. lack of coin on drops4. Fighting snakes and badgers for 20 lvls5. Exp debt upon dying6. Exp debt if you live but a party member dies7. Same monster, different name, over and over8. Lack of interesting zones, they all look/feel the same9. $15 a month fee to feel miserable10. Quests that are both uninteresting and unrewarding11. Bad, Bad, Bad, customer service12. Spending money to upgrade your PC to play this game13. Lack of good gear14. Overall feeling of wasting your time15. Very few moments of fun or accomplishment16. Other hardcore EQ gamers giving you griefAvoid this game unless you enjoy inflicting pain on your self. No Joke..."
3,Interesting but will it last,"I was an EQ1 player for three years till the economy of the game and the time requirements to raid became too much for me. I heard about EQII and it was tempting enough for me to give it a try for a month or two. The graphics are good almost too good since I have to tone down effects in order for some of the rending to look right (256 video 1gig ram). the quests to start are annoying, but if you never played EQ it helps get started (it should be optional). The other big improvement in my opinion is the balancing of the mobs. I've been able to kill mobs of lower level then me without much problem, unlike in the original were greens would regularly pound non fighters. I'm enjoying it so far but i'm not sure it will suck me in for another three year tenure."
2,"NOT FOR CASUAL GAMERS, TOO MUCH TO LEARN.....","This game has a steep learning curve and you are constantly having to switch between your browser window and the game in order to navigate and figure out what to do. If you don't want to be dependent on game FAQS which good ones are few and far bewteen, then don't get this game!"
4,everquest ****,the had the game in stock and it was delivered very quickly..love the game...very happy
2,Taking,"This game is only worth getting if you dont have a steady job and have very few social interactions with others. The game itself has decent eye candy, but it is so overly involved (with a VERY poor interface) that you'll spend hours trying to get anything meaningful done. There is more and more competition in the online game market and games like Everquest and {EDIT} only cater to the ultra hardcore ""role-players"". Check out to see the kind of experience your in for if you play this game. As a beta tester for {EDIT} and a long time {EDIT} I can assure you that both of those games are superior unless you like spending hours making spices to raise your ""Spicemaking"" ability by a point. You could finish a masters degree with the effort it takes to play Everquest."
1,AMAZON- please note,"Under no circumstances can this Game be classified as a simulation. Stick it in with all the other action/adventure games, make a category for monthly-money eater online game or what have you; but please remove this and its ilk from the simulation category."
1,HORRIBLE,"This game is a waste of $$$$. The first EQ was the greatest. The only problem was that there was 10 expantions for it which was pretty retarded. This game has great graphics, but the more pretty-looking the game gets, from my experience the crappier it gets(Except for HL2 and cs souce!!). I would strongly recomend WoW over Eq2.1 thing that is so retarded is how much memory it takes up. Anyway get WoW istead of this and ull thank me and LUV ME FOREVER!!!!!"
3,...It's okay.,"This game is 15 dollars a month and not too much worth it. It runs slow even on the best computer i have ( i have 4 ) I play this on my 2005 Sony Vaio. This computer is way past all requirements needed to play this game. However, online is simply brutal when you try to play. Even on high speed other than high quality, this game still runs slow. This game is FAIRLY fun but I don't see the need for the high graphics, when even some of the top computers on the market can't handle them. This game is good for people with an illegally made high performance computer, and someone who is willing to giv eup 15 bucks a month."
1,I prefered Everquest I,"I'm impressed by the graphics of EQ2, but after playing up to about level 20, I got bored. I was disappointed by the removal of many special and quirky features of various races. People who played high level druids or bards or enchanters in EQ1 will be very unhappy with EQ2. Forget about kiting, chain casting pets, or even spirit of wolf (now nerfed to uselessness). Cleary there was an attempt to make this game easier to play for everyone, but much less interesting for the expert."
1,"""Disappointing""","This CD is based on a live concert recording. Soif you don't like the off-keys that liveperformers operate at, then this CD isone not to buy. I think Amazon should updatetheir description to include that significantdetail, as it was listed on the cover ""live""."
2,Useless fone,Do not even buy this fone. It has the worst reception and will drop ur call if the reception is weak(On Cingular). Motorolas v300 and above are the best fones. I have this on cingular and even in places where the v300 picks up signal this one does not.DO NOT EVEN TRY TO BUY!!!!!!!!!
1,Cingular service not sold in my area by Amazon.com,"I was trying to order Cingular Cellphone service from amazon.com. When I gave my zip code, it says the service is not available in my area. I called customer service and they told me to give some big city nearby. I gave Boston and it says service is available. I started placing my order and on credit check form it complained about the zip code being different from the service area. I called customer service again and this time I got the answer that if it is not available in my zip code I can not place the order. I tried few near by cities which are adjacent town and it says service is available. I was really confused about it. How do amazon.com really decides to skip some towns while providing service.I'm frustrated with this experience and miscommunication from the customer serivce."
1,"Absolutely the worst phone I've owned, bar none.","It doesn't matter how many features a phone has if it just doesn't work. This morning, I just spent yet another hour on the phone with Cingular working out yet another warranty exchange for this, my THIRD T637. All had the same problem: suddenly, without warning, the backlight dies and the ominous message ""No network"" appears. You can neither make nor receive calls. Cingular service had no clues as to why this happened. I stuck with the phone so many times because I wanted a candy bar phone with Bluetooth, and I didn't want to ""upgrade"" after less than a year. But I'm not willing to sacrifice basic standards of quality. I'm going back to Motorola or Nokia, and taking a hit on $40 worth of chargers and accessories because I won't ever buy a Sony Ericsson product again."
3,Fuzz sound,"Just got the phone, but there was a fuzz sound or low humming coming out regardless of who I called, or how high the volume was. Seems like a great phone otherwise. Is anyone else having similar problems?"
2,Extremely flawed,"The camera is horrible.There's a screensaver function, but the screensaver only comes on for about a second because the phone goes into standby mode in two seconds. No way to change that.You can create only one true shortcut.Interface seems to be geared toward getting you online to buy more pictures and ringtones.You need to buy a proprietary headset.If you like to customize the settings on your phone, I suggest you stay away from this one."
2,Didn't care for it.,"I had this phone through Cingular, and I had alot of problems with it.First of all, the small size and crammed arrangement of the buttons made it hard to type a phone number in. The keys are slippery, and thus my fingers were always ""missing"".Second, the ""online"" button on the side is way too easy to push, and my phone was always connecting to the internet when I was least expecting it, and running up charges.Third, Cingular doesn't make it easy to see if you're roaming or not on this particular phone, which accounted for $3,000 in spurious roaming charges being accrued over a course of 3 months. This, combined with Cingular's really bad customer service (they kept shutting my phone off, and the regional director finally had to personally intervene in my case) made for one BAD experience. Translated: DON'T buy this phone if you live near the Canadian border, cuz this phone won't tell you if you're roaming or not.Better yet, steer clear of Cingular as well."
1,Good luck ordering from Amazon.com to get the special deal.,"Three times I tried ordering through Amazon and all times the order was cancelled with ""cingular is requesting information that we cannot provide so we are cancelling the order"". Intead of just asking the customer for the information!?!? So, I called customer service...yeah don't try finding that number here on the website I had google it because the only time they give it to you is on the page displayed right after your order, not on any of the emails you get...to be told, ""they're a new carrier for us and we can't do anything, we tell customers that get cancelled orders that basically sorry you're out of luck."" Direct quote from customer service representative.Would've been a good deal if I could've gotten it. Maybe it's because I'm an existing ATT customer?"
4,"Can't beat the ""cool"" factor...","I've had a lot of phones, and I prefer Motorola phones, but I also needed Bluetooth, and the V600 was just too expensive for me. But this phone is fantastic! The screen is vibrant, the sounds quality if great and the features are SO cool! I found this open source software, float's Mobile Agent (search Google), that allows the user to connect with the phone through the bluetooth connection and do all kinds of things with the phone, like assign photos and rings to contacts, upload images, audio, themes, etc.. It's a gadget geek's dream come true... Highly recommended."
2,"Neat features, Poor Quality",Lots of neat features... but poor signal strength places I have had excellent signals in the past. Also my battery is going down hill and it has been less than 6 months.Oh well... hope I do better with the next phone.
1,"Gave Sony a 2nd chance, still sucks","After years of problems with Sony home elctronics (and car audio) problems, I gave them another chance and bought this phone. Seemed pretty nice at first. Great screen and buttons. That's all it has going for it.Menus are incredibly slow, signal strength sucks, voice quality sucks. It tends to break apart when dropped (it happens). The screen is fantastic though..."
2,One of the worst phones I've ever had,"I bought this phone after using it predecessor the Sony Ericsson T610, and it was a complete let down. Among its problems the phone I had suffered from a circuit chip issue and had to be replaced. The next phone I received suffered from the same issue. Finally the third phone functioned correctly, but still not as well as my original T610. It has a cheap feel to it and the software lags behind user interaction. While providing more memory than the T610, it gets worse battery life and sound quality. The camera on either phone was not very good, but quite frankly you can not expect much from a camera phone. These are my thoughts, only looking to help out."
4,T637 is a nice improvement,"Coming from a T68i, it's hard not to like this phone. The reception is 10x better, the camera is easy to use, and the resolution beats anything I've had before. I have the T226 as a backup, and its performance is what convinced me to buy a T637. I clung to the T68i for it's features (bluetooth mainly), and resigned myself to a nonbluetooth T226 when reception was poor. Now I have it all. I'm not wild about the form factor, but hey - performance is key."
5,spiritual awakening,"I never knew that the bhajans that I grew up with could sound even more beatiful than when I learned them. This CD is entrancing; I took it with me when I was hiking in Oregon to help clear my mind and meditate and it was just what I needed. I have played it nearly every day that I've owned it, so that should be a testament to the talent of these artists."
2,Not bad for 2 songs,"I first heard the song a new enemy and thought I will get this album, so I get the album and the other songs are no way near in tempo and sound, as usual another one hit tempo, the other song I began to like was to the mountains and the drumming has good rhythm to it and the vocals are sheer energy with passion laced words in between. Maybe they could have called the song volcano instead. Other than the two songs the album becomes to me another very Lutheran area doing music in the likes of so many others from Finland and Sweden."
3,I found Satan at the Rock Show!,"Its clear that Satyr can write one hell of a catchy rock song. Fuel For Hatred was proof enough. The problem is I don't listen to Satyricon because I want to hear a catchy rock song. Volcano seemed to me the perfect mix of rock and Black Metal - enough groove to shake your booty, but enough strait-hate to thrash to. Now Diabolical just seems to peter out about halfway through. There are a number of great moments on ND but it seems that the album doesnt hold together. A couple of fantastic singles, and then a few damn good ideas. An awesome groove with no real follow through, a great set of lyrics with no riff or music... stuff like that. I just kind of drift in and out as the album plays. So, while Satyr is clearly not washed up, he needs to realize that Satyricon should not ever, ever be a singles band."
2,See My Review Under The Domestic Issue Of The Same.,"To paraphrase, speeds overall too fast. Ozawa's earlier 1969 Boston Symphony Version on RCA-BMG FAR preferable."
2,Not really for toddlers...,"The use of the word uterus was a little much for my little one. Plus, I think the book could have skipped over the whole ""hospital scene and the actual description of the baby coming out of mommy"". Again TMI."
4,Answers children's questions,"Joanna Cole (I Am a Big Brother, I Am a Big Sister) has created yet another great book for sharing with young children. Directly addressing toddlers and preschool age children, Cole tells about pregnancy and childbirth. Using terms such as uterus, umbilical cord, and breast, and with illustrations of a child inside the womb, Cole and Chambliss have created a wonderful book for parents to share with very, young children, especially when a new baby is expected. Additional information on answering children's questions about birth is provided at the back of the book."
4,que dificil es,I really like this album becuase I can almost relate to all her song and i really like her honesty and her talent she is a wonderfull person and a wonderfull artist i like her alot
1,"Man, I shoulda saved my money!","Out of about 40 songs, only 3 peaked my interest. This album should of been titled, ""Disco Throwaways"". This album stinks, and like the former complaint about disco music, this album sucks."
3,nice to have,"Although he sounded much better when I heard him play live, this record is something ""nice to have"" in your classical CD collection.But, do not forget to go see him play live!"
1,Not an easy read,"I had to read this book for a statistics course. In the Preface, it states ""We presume students using this book have a minimal mathematical background (high school algebra) and no prior coursework in statistics"" (page xi; 2004 edition). I found this statement to be stretching the truth; this book is hard to read, hard to understand and hard to digest. Contrary to the preface's inviting statement, the reader would be in a MUCH better position to have mastered calculus and to have HAD previous experience in statistics. This book is NOT an easy read as the statement above would suggest. I had to abandon using this book in the course and resort to other texts. Caveat emptor."
4,Good Seller.,"This product came very quickly and when expected. I ended up not needing the book for my class so I could not return it, but the product was in good condition."
2,Mathematically disappointing,"Ott and Longnecker's book has been used as the textbook for a course on statistical methods in a mathematics department. As a student, I was very disappointed. The book is well-written, and makes direct applications to simple problems easy. However, almost no mathematical explanation of the methods adopted to solve problems is provided! The book may be appropriate for a course offered in lower-division engineering or in social science, but as a textbook for a math class, it is overly simplistic."
5,Exceptionally Good,"I have several hundred cookbooks and this one's a treasure. It consider it great just as a Mediterranean cookbook: it compares favorably to the works of Joyce Goldstein, Marcella Hazan, Phaidon's Silver Spoon, and other great cookbooks of that region.But this book goes further than great recipes: it is low carb, grain-free, gluten-free, mostly dairy-free, and mostly paleo. It is by far the best low carb cookbook out there; I have them all. The emphasis is on fresh vegetables, fresh meat/poultry/fish, olive oil, and Mediterranean flavor ingredients like olives, capers, etc.I've made more than a dozen of the recipes so far, and each has been great. Not just good, but exceptionally good.I can only hope that the author will write a second volume (and third, and fourth ...)."
4,Cute and fun,"I love this toy. I bought it for myself for something to do. I also thought it was cute. I think it would be great for two to four year olds. I think children who are older might want something a bit more challenging. Overall, it's a great toy."
1,Lost Faith In Mountain Goats,"-I respect musicianship and this album deserves 5 stars, 0 is representaive of my feeling for this album-I feel saddened because the Mountain Goats have lost their charm to me. The majority of listeners in the music-world like production, but I hear them as lacking the rawness of their early albums. Production is the ultimate enemy to music in my opinion, which I accept is the antithesis of most peoples' view. I miss when it sounded like a guitar recorded in a boombox. All Hail West Texas was so revalent and sweet-hearted. There was a detachment from the self-concious sound, which is the epitome of independent music. Everyone progresses, but I appreciate a regression towards simplicity. A ballad with just a guitar proved to be something something outstanding because it was a refreshing break from music coated for the masses. The Mountain Goats have moved into a direction I cannot bring myself to support, but I respect their movement nonetheless."
3,Selfish singing,"The first half is a welcome extension to their barebones, rustic Death Cab For Cutie style. It works in the songs favor and helps contrast the self-centered lyricist, who sometimes displays that rare technique of being a genuinely gripping songwriter, though more often seems to over-enunciate emotional intellectualism into self conscious realms, paired mostly in nasally, They Might Be Giants-esque singing tones which negates the overall synergy."
4,"Catchy, smart, and dripping with pathos","Amazingly-written record about childhood tribulations with girls, alcohol and general teenage angst, set against a backdrop of life with an abusive, alcoholic stepfather. Lesser songwriters would dwell on the dispairing nature of this lyrical fodder. But far from wallowing in self pity, songwriter John Darnielle's character takes on an almost defiant tone, trying to wring everything he can out of life - because of rather than in spite of - what lies waiting for him when he returns home. All of this is cocooned inside an earnest, acoustic chamber pop with simple guitar/piano interplay and flat percussion. It's catchy, it's smart, and it's dripping with pathos."
4,A mostly-great album,"Okay, so I'm by no means an uber-fan, and I don't have all 308 Mountain Goats albums, but of the few that I do have, this is easily the best. I don't always ""get"" Darnielle's songs, lyrically, but The Sunset Tree has some of his most straightforward songs. My favorites are ""The Broom People"", ""This Year"" and ""Dance Music"", all of which are beautiful songs with really moving lyrics. Just when I though I didn't care much for The Mountain Goats, here's a reason to keep listening!"
5,Piercing Candor,"It's hard to figure how Mr. Darnielle works his particular magic, but this concept album of sorts about his upbringing by his abusive stepfather, is not as depressing as you might think. In fact, it's rather uplifting...I guess it's the humanity that shines through and the determination and undauntable spirit evinced in lyrics like, ""I'm gonna make it through this year if it kills me""...Beautiful, deep and penetrating lyrics set to gorgeous chamber-folk arrangements. Essential."
4,Really Nice Performances,"This 2 cd recording of Sir Colin Davis conducting Haydn's London symphonies are over all ""really nice performances"". And I'm an original instrument kind of guy. It's funny how so many people make far too much fuss over old conductors such as Beechum & Furtw?ngler. These conductors perform Haydn wonderfully but the recording sound quality is ridiculously poor... and good luck trying to acquire them, if you MUST. Some act as if nobody could ever conduct Haydn as well. I totally disagree. I have a recording of a nobody conductor by the name of Hickox conducting the Collegium Musicum 90 doing Haydn's symphonies 103,95 & 104. They are so well done. Just listen to symphony 103 in this recording. However, my favorite Haydn conductors are Hogwood & Br?ggen. One warning though, stay away from Dorati. He had no business conducting the great Haydn and to think of all the great reviews he's received. Puzzling..."
4,WOW!,"Amazing Product, great shipping, what;s not to love? They play cleanly and I have bought more in the past. They look amazing on the guitar! The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the black coating does fade after a while, but that's is what you should expect from different color guitar strings."
3,Not so great,These seem ok but I feel as thou the low E and to some extent the A sound dead. The coating quickly chipped of the 5th string after light use. Most likely wouldnt order again and cant recommend
3,Still not what I'm looking for,"I really like a lot of the concepts in this organizer:1 daily and monthly calanders2 lots of space on the weekend days as well as weekdays3 room in the back for internet information, babysitters, kids organizations, etc.I did not like:1 there's no place to keep a pen (who can ever find one in a hurry when you need one?)2 I like a planner that closes so stuff doesn't fall out3 I did as she suggested and put a plastic envelope in the back for loose things like coupons, but then it made the pages lumpy and hard to write on, on the right side.I like the concept, and maybe a more organized person would love it as is, but I need a planner because I'm not organized, and this one needs a little tweaking for my needs."
5,Excellent organizer,"I have used this calendar/organizer for the past few years. I like it because I have all the information I need in one, compact place. The calendar is your normal one week at a glance format. On either side of the calendar are lists - a ""to do"" list, as well as a grocery list. At the front is a space for frequently called numbers, and at the back there are several categories for phone numbers/addresses. This includes, children's friends, children's organizations, as well as just a traditional address book type area. There are also plenty of stickers with which to identify important things such as birthdays, anniversaries, vacations, Dr. and Dentist appointments and many other things. If you have a busy family and need a lot of information at your fingertips, this is the organizer for you."
5,Get your schedule on track,"I have used the Amy Knapp Family Organizers for three years now and would be lost without them. It has everything I need - lots of room to note appointments, a shopping list, menu planning, to do lists, phone numbers, month-at-a-glance, and even inspirational messages. And, they even have space for planning into the next year! I have recommended this planner to several friends who also swear by it. Finally, a planner that has it all."
3,good for menu planners... otherwise not so great,"OK, I confess, I don't plan my menus for the week ahead. And I write my shopping list on a whiteboard on the refrigerator and copy it onto sheets from one of those magnetic notepads when I go to the store. So I just didn't use two of the major features of this calendar. And I found the horizontal daily planning spaces inconvenient for both appointments and notes.I did appreciate that there was as much space for Saturday and Sunday as for weekdays. And apparently, the monthly pages in this year's edition are at the beginning of each month's section of weekly pages, making them much easier to use than when they're grouped at the back. But I'm still looking for the perfect family engagement calendar--for me, this isn't it."
3,18 Months merit only 3 Stars from me....,"I hate the 18 month format!!! I love this calendar but find it wasteful to have to copy everything from my current calendar to the new one! (Or not copy it and then just waste 6 months of a calendar that I PAID for) I wish she had both a 12 and 18 month version available like she used to. I also don't like the new MONTHLY calendar being in the middle of the weekly pages. I find it disruptive to the flow. IF I get one this year, it will be the 3rd year to use it but I may look for something else that suits my needs better."
2,"Good enough, for government work . . .","This is a serviceable little pin. I bought it for my legion hat, to put with an assortment of other small pins and am pretty unimpressed. It will do; I certainly don't want to buy another, but . . . it is very blurry and the backing isn't great."
3,Good Mix,"I purchased the cd for the feature song ""Can't Fight The Moonlight"" but was surprised to find some good songs in the mix. As with any good movie soundtrackthe quality of the tracks were good and found some interesting recording techniques that I haven't heard since the Beatles. Overall it's a good CD."
3,Why only 3 stars?,Let me tell you that I love this CD. I am not a hugh fan of Leanne Rimes but these song are really good. The thing that really bugs me is that when you view the credits on the movie you see a ton of songs listed then you by the CD and most of the good ones aren't on it. So many people have listed them so I won't but the least the producers of the soundtrack could have done is put out a Coyote Ugly Soundtrack 2.... we need those song! I mean really why have them in the movie if you are not planning on putting them in the ST.
3,What it's missing...,"Although this CD does have a few good highlights, such as LeAnn Rimes' Can't Fight the Moonlight, The Right Kind of Wrong, But I Do Love you, as well as EMF's Unbelievable featured throughout the entire film, it is missing great songs seen in the film. I picked this CD up in Target a few months back and was surprised AND disappointed to see that Pour Some Sugar On Me by Def Leppard, I Will Survive, and Blondie's One Way or Another were not included in the mix. These were important, stand out songs in the movie and I'm not quite sure as to how one could forget to add these. Other than that, the CD is ok, not much to recommend. If you were looking to buy it, my advice would be to download the LeAnn Rimes songs and Unbelievable, and the always lovable 'Devil Went Down To Georgia.' Save your money and wait till a better soundtrack comes around."
3,"Good, but not good enough...","I was very excited to find this cd, but disappointed when I saw what was and wasn't on it. Several of the songs featured in the movie such as Pour Some Sugar on Me by Def Leopard, One Way or Another by Blondie, Cowboy by Kidrock, and I Will Survive by Cake were not featured on this soundtrack. Those songs were vital to the movie and I found that the absence of them on the soundtrack made it difficult to keep the tone of the soundtrack consistent with the tone of the movie. The soundtrack was rather blah, with the exception of the Leann Rhimes songs, EMF, INXS, Don Henley, and the Charlie Daniels Band. My recommendation would be to download the actual soundtrack songs that you like off of napster, and mix them with the other songs that aren't on the original soundtrack, and burn your own cd."
3,Coyote Ugly misses some hits,"This Cd misses some of the big hits that were played in the movie(which was great). Although it comes through with some great past dance tracks like EMF's ""unbeliveable"" and LeeAnn Rimes songs were pretty good Too, But leaving out songs like ""Pour some sugar on me"" and ""It takes Too"" I could only give this Cd 3 Stars."
4,"Ms. Twain, MOVE OVER.....","I bought this CD because the music made the movie fun to watch. I was blown away by the first four songs!! LeAnne Rimes does a great job, and what a voice. It makes you wonder why she ever did country in the first place.I was disappointed to discover the omission of Blondie's ""One way or another"" from this album. One would think that because the song played an important role in one scene, not to mention the fact that I came out of the theater with it stuck in my head, that it would have been included. Were it not for this, I would have rated this album with 5 stars."
2,Left out too many songs,"This CD is good, but given the amount of awesome music in the movie, they could have made an effort to have the CD be all-inclusive. A pivotal point of the movie in which Violet sings ""One Way or Another"" should have made this song a top priority. Others in the movie but left off the soundtrack include:DEF LEPPARD- Pour some sugar on me BILLY IDOL - Rebel yell STRAY CATS - Rock this town LENNY KRAVITZ - Fly away UNCLE CRACKER - Follow me KID ROCK - CowboyAs I said, the songs they did included are great, but when watching a movie and hearing the awesome songs, one expects them ALL to be a part of the soundtrack."
4,Coyote YES!!!,"This CD and this movie made me want to get up and dance. I loved what i heard, what i saw..... the music in this movie was awesomly put together. The songs that were made to portray the songs the main character made up were also very great and i enjoyed some new artists talent. All in all i loved everything about the music and the movie."
1,It's Missing the Best Part!,"The best part of the movie, in short, was Alex Band and Aaron Kamin's musical performance of ""Wherever You Will Go"". However, they were not included in the soundtrack. So instead of a 5, I'll have to give this CD a 1, because WYWG would have been the best song on the CD anyway."
2,"All good stuff, except LeAnn Rimes","The soundtrack would be much better if they had used her voice from the movie instead of her regular voice. I don't really know how they did it, but they made LeAnn Rimes' voice sound good in the movie. It was great that they included music from different genres and eras (i.e. INXS and Charlie Daniels). There are several songs that I really like, but don't own the cd, like ""Unbelievable"" by EMF and ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"". If you like these songs and can tolerate LeAnn Rimes, buy this cd."
5,Rimes songs are winners,"This soundtrack is GREAT---mainly because of the 4 new songs by LeAnn Rimes---from Pop to R&B sound to the torchy sound of ""Please Remember"" she is famous for---With these new songs --Rimes shows she is definately a force to be reckoned with in the music industry as she is one of few artists that can sing any style of music!!----the other songs ---all types---are great also--This album will make you want to dance----We dont buy Soundtracks normally--but could'nt miss this one--If you like real country music --new artist Tamara Walker has a new song on this CD also that impressed us------movie was good also!"
4,Critique of Coyote Ugly,"I LOVED the music from the movie, Coyote Ugly; however, when I listened to excerpts from the CD, I was terribly disappointed. I thought that a ""soundtrack"" meant it would sound the same.Unfortunately, I was wrong."
4,Awsome CD but....,"I got this CD and love all of the songs, but as many of the other Coyote Ugly fans have already pointed out, the Soundtrack is missing ""One Way or Another"" by Blondie. This is the song that I imediately recognized while watching the movie, so surely it should be on the soundtrack. Other than that, the CD is great. I play it all the time and I highly recomend it !"
4,"Pretty good movie, EXCELLENT CD","After going to see the movie Coyote Ugly, I immediatly wanted to go buy the soundtrack. Although the movie wasnt as great as I anticipated it to be, the soundtrack made me want to get up and dance everytime the music came on. The next day I went out and bought the cd. I was not disappointed at all! Although I was never a big Leann Rimes fan, this soundtrack really changed my mind. Not only are her songs the best part of the soundtrack, but her country style of singing adds to the songs, rather than take away. Although I'm not usually a big country fan, i love this cd. everyone should go out and buy it. Just like the movie, it makes you want to get up and dance."
4,Dying to Know,"This is a great CD, worth every cent.....however like many other customers I was disappointed that some great songs were not on it. I would still like to know the artist and song title to the song that goes ""Someday or another...I'm gonna meet ya..."" and also the song played in the background when Violet hugs her father goodbye....END"
5,You Will Love This Album,You will love this album so much. It has so many good songs on it. I mean Leann Rimes she is my favorite singer! INXS is great on this album too. My advice buy this album!
2,Why LeAnn Rimes?,"I think the girl who played Violet did a great job of singing the 4 songs in the movie, so why are they done by LeAnn on the soundtrack? I think that takes away from the CD even though they are such great songs."
2,Missing the mark,"The music is very enjoyable when taken for it's own merits, but there were a lot more songs in the movie I would have like see such as the Elvis song or Pour some sugar on me. There are at least 7 songs missing that I can recall off the top of my head (all of which would have been great additions).This should have been a two CD soundtrack. The LeAnn Rimes songs are bunched together at the beginning which made me feel I was listening first to one of her CD's and then to a compilation CD.Good music poorly packaged would be my synopsis."
4,Leann Rimes play two role,"The album is really good. I like to hear song ""Can't fight the moonlight"".Actually I want to get this album cause its come from Coyote ugly.And leann Rimes do the great job by doing the two voice for the each song in movie. And people thinking that was a ""Piper"" voice! So amazing.But I really like if Leann Rimes sing with another voice that she ""created"" to a character Violet played by Piper Perabo.Anyway the album still good."
4,I See Only One Problem,"I always thought the songs included on a soundtrack were the ones being played the loudest on-screen. When Violet first enters Coyote Ugly, the jukebox is blasting ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" by Def Leppard. This song is awesome. It rocks. So why is it not on the soundtrack? Instead of including INXS, you should have included Def Leppard."
5,Good music on one CD-a rarity,"This was a suprising soundtrack. It was varied and fun. There seemed to be something for everyone to enjoy (even the Leanne Rimes). I highly recommend the Coyote Ugly soundtrack to anyone who likes something outside the current boy group or identical-seeming rap stars. Much of this is classic music, especially the Charlie Daniel's Band ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia."""
4,LeAnn Rimes sounds great!,"I first heard the title song 'Can't Fight the Moonlight' from the tv advertisement of Coyote Ugly. The song just makes me moves. I never thought that LeAnn is the one who's singing this marvellous track.. Besides, 'The Right Kind of Wrong' is also another great tune... I simply love the tracks!"
4,"Misleading but still very, very good","I have seen and heard the objections of those who thought that Piper Perabo sang those in the movie, but if they take a moment when they listen to this CD, it is, believe it or not, the same voice heard in the movie. Piper Perabo is not actually singing the songs, but please do not let that discourage you from buying this CD. If not for the last three songs on the album, I would quickly have rated the song 5 stars. I expected the Def Leppard songs to be in this album, and not the three songs(Boom Boom Boom being above and beyond the worst) that I have no knowledge that I ever heard in the movie."
4,You Can't Fight The Moonlight!,"Lee-Ann rimes is what makes this CD good. You hear it once and you hooked! I cant get ""Cant fight the moonlight"" out of my head. It just kind hypnotizes you. Listen to the CD today and youll own a copy tomorrow."
3,"Where Is ""One Way Or Another""?","I can't believe they omitted one of the most crucial songs on the soundtrack - Blondie's ""One Way Or Another"", even though Blondie's official web site mentions it being on the soundtrack. Luckily, you can still find it on their newly reissued ""Parallel Lines"" album. There were more songs that are missing from the album (notably Def Leppard's ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"") but it's pretty insane that ""OWOA"" isn't here."
5,Great Soundtrack,This Soundtrack is a must have for any Coyote Ugly Fan. The mixture of songs caters to all ages. It is great background music for a get together or for the car. I would highly recommend this CD.
3,missing a little something,"I really liked this movie, and most of the songs which are on the soundtrack. However, what about the other songs that play a major role in the movie? for example Blondie's ""ONE WAY OR ANOTHER"". I was really looking forward to hearing it on the C.D. Some other songs that are featured in the movie are not there as well such as ""POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME"" by Def Leppard. Myself, and other buyers were disappointed."
3,Here's Piper Perabo,"To Kim, who wondered why ""Piper Perabo's"" versions of the songs were not on the soundtrack - that's because she did not sing them - LeAnn Rimes sang Piper's parts as well, just in a different voice. Piper lipsynched her way through the entire movie.As far as soundtracks go, this one's definetly one of the better ones I've heard. Nice to hear 'oldies' but goodies from SNAP, INXS and Charlie Daniels....the ballads are also entertaining, but mostly because they make you think about the absolute ridiculousness of the movie - if you haven't seen Coyote Ugly yet, save the ticket money and put it toward the soundtrack. At least something connected to this travesty will be worth the $8. (Unless you liked Showgirls - in that case, run, do not walk to the theatre.)"
5,BUT.................,you should play the whole song.i would type more but I don't want to right now so bye!
3,Great CD to follow a great Movie!,"The Coyote Ugly was one of the best movies that i have seen in awhile (even though many people said that it was a terrible movie) to follow this movie they came out with one of the best soundtracks around. With LeAnn Rimes singing some great songs along with many other songs from different genres,i would consider this one of the best soundtracks of the year!"
2,tupac,"Didn't finish reading this book, cause it started out with it being a kid from the same school and how he didn't like tupac, and how he used to think this and think that of him, and why would I want to hear the negative about the man. I don't, and I see it as someone who didnt like him and got money from a book that he doesn't deserve. Don't buy it..."
4,DEFINITELY WORTH CHECKING OUT,"THIS IS IN NO WAY A BIOGRAPHY OF THE LATE GREAT 2PAC. THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN BY DARRIN KEITH BASTFIELD, A GUY THAT WENT TO SCHOOL WITH PAC DURING THE YEARS THAT PAC WAS LIVING IN BALTIMORE. THE BOOK REALLY EXPLORES THE FRIENDSHIP THAT DARRIN HAD WITH PAC BEFORE HE SKYROCKETED TO FAME. THE BOOK IS PRETTY GOOD. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THAT YOU GET TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW 2PAC HAD GOT INTO ACTING. THIS IS DEFINITELY WORTH READING. JUST GIVE IT A CHANCE."
2,renac new name doesn't make it better,I have used and love my renac for years - the new ones don't seem to heat and hold up as well as the old ones - I used to make one last a good 2-3 years and now if I get a year out of one I am lucky - the new one I have is already not heating properly.
2,"Having to send it back, screws came out!",I am having to pay $12.00 to send in a new product that is less than a month old. Screw that holds it together came out. I tried to re insert the screw but won't work. I think if a product is new and barely used it should be free to send it in for repair or replacement.
4,hair styler,It's what we always use. It does what we want at a reasonable price. They do burn out pretty quick.
3,Not like the original,"I agree with the others who say it's not like it used to be. Doesn't get as hot! Not a high quality product! The on/off push button has not worked on the last 2 I bought. I usually end up taping it to the high position. The black tip often wobbles. What a shame someone had to ""dumb it down"" in order to make a bigger profit."
5,Great Read!,"I went to one of his lectures here in Jacksonville, FL and he was amazing! I just had to buy this book. If you don't know ANYTHING about western philosophy, it may be difficult to understand. The author still runs a short synopsis in the beginning of the book. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys philosophy or to be more knowledgeable of different cultures."
3,"Picture good, compatibility poor.","The picture is very nice. There were no dead pixels. The only problem is that you have to tweak the settings of the computer quite a bit to maximize the graphics. That means playing around with refresh rate, color and resolution until you find the correct fit. The monitor is very picky when it comes to these settings because it doesn't have it's own driver. It just uses the generic ""Plug N Play"" driver from Windows XP.The speakers are pretty worseless, unless you like mono sounding windows."
1,Very low quality,"There is a reason these Kogi LCDs are so cheap: the quality is awful. My dad bought one last week because of the price, but after we set it up we assumed we had a bad one. We took it back to the store and got a replacement. It looked just as bad. Finally I asked my dad if he looked at the one in the store. He had, but they were running a screen saver so he couldn't tell too much about the quality. So we took this one back for a refund. We had them stop the screen save and the minute the Windows desktop came up you could see how bad it was compared to the other brands in the store. The moral is you get what you pay for."
4,For $300 Bucks....it's a Deal!,"I needed to save some space, put the old iron to rest, and not spend a fortune. I am using this monitor in my test lab connected to a couple of W2K Servers. It was a toss up between this and the Envision, I flipped a coin, this won. I'm really surprised and very pleased with the quality. The picture is excellent, I had no dead pixels, it arrived via UPS safely. Since the unit has built in speakers, the footprint is kind of large, it dwarfs my Dell 17"" Flat panel. It's a deal with the rebate. It also made me feel better that Amazon would make good on it if it turned out to be a dog. Don't be afraid of buying this Unit"
4,it is a good monitor,it is pretty good with respect to its price. the picture is clear. problem is its compatibility. mine is set at 1024*768 pixels and 1280*1024 does not work well.
1,Monitor is fuzzy,This monitor is priced to sell but the image quality is downright poor. Images and text are fuzzy. Return to sender!
1,I have purchased this item in 2003,"This is (by far) the WORST monitor I have ever seen in my entire life. Since purchased, it's been repaired under warranty 4 times (in the last 6 months). I can guarantee you, if you want to waist your money and time, buy this KOGI monitor, then refresh your memory what I have told you and warned you about. Even the fact: the company Kogi doesn't exist in the world. They are making this item under the company name Gvision, which most likely the same garbage, as a Kogi. They are based in the S.California and their customer support is NULL. I have purchased this item with a rebate, which I have never received from them. When called them on the phone, they said that they have never received anything from me, although I have a mailing receipt. The bottom line is: this monitor is GARBAGE, the company is fake and there nobody you can possibly complain about all that."
1,"Worked great for one year, then died","I purchased a 17"" Black Kogi LCD flat panel in November of 2003 and loved the monitor that I got for the money. The speakers were quite pathetic, but I used my surround sound system instead. The image quality was very good, and I used to brag to my friends about the low price I paid for this LCD. Well all that changed in December 2004, when the unit completely died and won't power up. My unit died just a few days after the one year warranty expired, and trying to work with this manufacturer is a nightmare -- they never call or email back ever! Because of the poor customer service and bad warranty, I can not longer recommend Kogi, but only tell you to buy an LCD that has a good warranty. I recently purchased a Princeton 714, and it comes with a great warranty (full 3 years, even on the backlight) and DVI input for less cost than the Kogi.My Kogi has been retired to the landfill, and I will never again purchase a Kogi/GVision product."
5,"Bright, No Dead Pixels, Excellent Value","For the price, this monitor can't be beat. It is very bright, and not a dead pixel. Of course, that's not a guarantee for the next person that buys. The speakers are tinny, but if you want to listen to music, you wouldn't use your monitor for that anyway. I looked high and low, and this was the best deal to be found when the rebate is included."
1,Look before you buy,"After returning two Kogi monitors I went down to a local store (Best Buy) and took a good look at their displays: all terrible. I ask the clerk and he said they are so bad that he tries to keep people from buying them. They just don't last. If you don't believe me, go take a look for yourself. The text is fuzzy and jumpy. There is a reason they are so cheap: they are pure junk."
1,should have read the reviews,All the one star reviews are right on. An absolutely useless piece of junk.
1,worthless,"The temperature gage is not even close to being accurate, so I can't trust the hygrometer either. Guess you can't expect accuracy out of something so cheap."
2,Dont waste your money,Combined with shipping its just not worth the money. All plastic. Home depot has an electronic one with LCD readout that is less money and no shipping.
1,Total junk,"My daughter didn't play with it much, she didn't ""get"" it, and it still managed to break in no time. Also, the stylus pens that come with it are worthless when you can't find them. They kept falling out and were gone even before the thing broke."
1,What is this?,What happened to De La Soul? The 2 AOI records are so far off from the legendary Stakes Is High record that I was embarassed that I bought it. If you loved the Mind State and Stakes records stay away from this record.
1,Lame lame lame,"What in the blazes happened here? There are so many wrong things with this record. Lame instrumental tracks. Lamer comedy sketches, and I use that phrase in the loosest way possible. And MC delivery taht's so uninspired, so half-hearted. I don't know if it's the concept of the trilogy that's hemming them in or what, but they have gone down the terlet."
4,Still Maintaining,"It's easy to say that De La Soul are hip hop pioneers, but amazingly, they are still current with hip hop. Better than the first installment, 'AOI Bionix' reveals how De La Soul continues to redefine hip hop, keeping it fresh with a mix of old and new innovation. ""Trying People"" is a wonderful song. Get this album when you can and support hip hop authenticity."
5,My favorite,De La SoulThis is one of my favorite groups. (Wu-Tang & Outkast)Rev Do GoodIt will not disappoint. This album you can play with an older crowd around w/o worring about BEEP BEEP BEEP every 10 sec.
2,I Hope De La Soul is not Dead,"As a big fan of the De La, I was interested in seeing how their innovative style would play out in Bionix, their sixth album. They did hit me with a fresh, unexpected style. Unfortunately, this style sounded more like R. Kelly than the Roots. Maybe it was because they were trying to be as futuristic as the album's concept, but the album had a generally overproduced, whiny, R&B sound. Not a lot of tight, forceful rhyme-dropping. And not much of the laid back, silly style that endeared us all to these guys to begin with, though I guess that has been gone for a while. One bright spot is ""Held Down,"" which, though kind of R&B-like, has a great beat, and features some good verses. Inspiring and passionate--certainly not typical De La Soul, but very good. Let's hope that the third incarnation of Art Official Intelligence, which they left no doubt they would be releasing, is nothing like this."
4,"de la's least successful, yet most under rated","This album did so terribly on the charts. Its only sold 78,000 copies so far on the shelves, and didnt even crack the top 100 of the charts. Thats pretty bad when his last album, the first part of AOI, peaked in the top 10 of the charts at number 9. I dont understand. His lead single, Baby Phat, is such a catchy and great song, and was once the number 2 downloaded song in the nation. its a positive song about overweight women. it has alot of other intersting subjects in his album. i saw a music video for ""me, myself, and I"" on MTV2, and realized how much de la soul has grown from that album. De La Soul is Dead will always be known as his classic album, but this is my favorite from him. Possibly the best album so far this year you didnt hear."
1,"Definitely NOT Better, Stronger or Faster...","When I bought this album I was most definitely disappointed. It was really not worth the money.All the tracks in the album are mediocre especially ""Baby Phat"", ""Pawn Star"", and ""What We Do""One reasonable track is ""Simply Havin'"" which uses a sample already by used A Tribe Called Quest. Along with the electronic female narrator De La do ""borrow"" quite a bit from A Tribe Called Quest in this album.The only track that is close to being good is ""Watch Out"", which uses a sample from Cal Tjader's Cubano Chant, but having said this the sample could have been used a lot better.I think De La have just finally succumbed to the Dollar which soon enough tempts and destroys hip hop artists.De La Soul IS Dead"
1,There's a very good reason this is out of print.,"I'll keep this short and sweet.Simply is a pretty good track, while Held Down, Baby Phat, and Bionix are OK. Coming into track 9 (Special,) I was pretty surprised how decent this CD was turning out to be. However, by the closing of the aforementioned track, the album took a nose dive that it would never come back from. All of the badness in Bionix culminates in what is quite possibly the worst song of all time, Pawn Star. Extra disrespect goes to Simply Havin, which uses the exact same sample as in ATCQ's ""Footprints."" One would think that they're familiar with Tribe's material, but whatever.For the most part, this CD is garbage and doesn't hold up to De La's standards in the least. Perhaps you could buy Simply and Held Down on ITunes, but buying the CD as a whole is a complete waste of money. It certainly isn't worth the 14 bucks I spent for it."
2,Sad Sad Sad,"This album makes me very sad. Its really horrible to hear such a great, once innovative group make an album that is so...blah. The vibrant neon colors of the first three albums are now washed to grey. The production, for the most part is pedestrian, and De La sound like tired old men. This album is very unfortunate. They need to get some hip hop viagra."
3,Hit&Miss,De La Soul was once a Very Cleaver Group back in the day but over the years things have kinda slowed down.now this is a far better Set than there Last Album but then again that ain't saying much.they had there own style&Vibe in the Daisey Age.but things done changed.the Beats&Grooves don't quite hit me the same.I Respect them for what they do on a whole but there is far more to them that what is being Presented here.
2,Not like the movie,"While John Williams' beautiful melodies are intact, and some of the segments appear the same as those in the movie, the use of a different soloist for Monica's theme was a real surprise. If one expects to hear the same etherial voice as on the movie, he or she will be disappointed. The two versions of ""For Always"" are interesting, and I can imagine that I will be hearing it at weddings before long, but that doesn't lessen my disappointment at not getting the actual soundtrack used in the movie."
5,Pure delight,"John Williams is surely one of the biggest composer of the century. His score of AI is a mixture of nostalgy, profound sadness and pessimism (as is undoubtly the film) but it's a pure masterpiece.Monica's theme is among the most beautiful ever composed by Williams (The Force Theme, the Imperial March...) but is certainly the most sentimental.I'll pass it on and on and get on my wife nerves again with a John Williams CD but I just can't help it !"
4,MISSING IN ACTION,"LOVED THE FILM. WHEN WAS OUT OF THE THEATRE HALL, RAN STRAIGHT TO THE CLOSEST TOWER RECORDS STORE. CAME HOME AND PLAYED IT ON. ONCE.AT THE SECOND TIME,SKIPPED THE HORRIBLE LARA FABIANE.FROM THEN JUST TRYING TO HUMM THE BEAUTIFUL THEMES OF THE FILM THAT ARE NOT ON THE CD. REALY CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT.TOO BAD.TOO DISAPPOINTING.WOULD THERE BE A DIFFERENT EDITION ?"
4,Very Nice Score,"Yet again, John Williams has produced an excellent score to an intriguing film of Steven Speilberg. The score features many tracks very similiar to his previous work with shades of Close Encounters and E.T. Definitely worth listening to and purchasing if you are a fan of his work.A particular favorite of mine is his song ""For Always"" which tenderly serves as the mother/son theme for the film. Just beautiful. It wonderfully expresses the strong feelings of David's love for his mother. A nice contrast to the cold and dark themes that are always present in the film."
5,Excellent companion to the film....,"I can never get over the wealth of creativity constantly displayed by Mr. John Williams in his scores for several of my favorite films. A.I. is definitely no exception. When I saw the film I was intrigued and interested but I did not realize how good it really was until I discussed it in depth with my wife after we saw it. Then I bought this soundtrack. The more I listen to it, the more I realize the depth and subtlety of the themes being conveyed: the sense of longing, the desparation for acceptance and tolerance for those who are different. I could go on and on but please see the movie (twice if you have to!) and keep an open mind. Don't listen to the critics. See it and then buy the soundtrack for the beautiful music! You will not be disappointed."
5,Williams is simply the best,"I also don't know how he does it. John Williams has once again endowed a musical soul upon a challenging, touching cinematic work. While A.I. may have come with all the trappings and hype of a big-budget, Hollywood epic, it is at its core a very gentle, ""human"" story of loss and redemption and dreams fulfilled, if only briefly. Williams' score captures the hopeful yet melancholy spirit of this wonderful film as no other film composer could. In many ways, the themes of Williams' A.I. score provide the thematic bridge between the works of Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick. The A.I. score is hauntingly beautiful, invoking so many of the emotions I experienced seeing this film. Bravo to an American Master upon another creative triumph!"
1,Effective?,"Is there any such thing as an ""effective"" condo board member to begin with? And in whose opinion? ""Effective"" is subjective."
1,Bad for baby,"I have seen people use these and they look so uncomfortable! I tried a friend's and my baby squirmed all over and cried the whole 2 minutes I had him in it. We have a Beco and love it. It creates a seat for the baby where as in the bjorn the baby is hanging by his crotch. The website claims the baby's weight is distributed evenly, but that doesn't make sense. He is hanging by his crotch. I do not recommend this carrier at all. The beco can hold a forward facing baby, facing you, back carry and hip carry. Don't buy it, for the sake of your baby!"
5,Very useful,"A little disclaimer: My baby is a little over 3 months old, and I've only had the Babybjorn Active for a few weeks.The Babybjorn is very comfortable for the parents so far (although after a few hours it leaves red marks on the shoulders), with good back support. After getting used to the carrier, my baby liked it too, loving facing out and looking at the world, but being satisfied with napping while facing in as well.Word to the wise: put a small towel, burp cloth or something similar where the baby is facing, because the drool (and spit up) are sure to come.Oh, and regarding the dark blue/blue coloring: it doesn't look at all like the picture, and is in fact much nicer."
5,Nice,I like this but have to admit that it seems to take a rocket scientist to adjust. Baby is very secure and it is quality made so that you can hand down to another mom or two when you're done. (These are expensive.)
5,Worth Every Penny- Love my Babybjorn,"I read reviews for over a month and read about the infanito, bjorn classic and several others. I ordered this because the reviews seemed to have better ratings for back support.I loveeee it. My daughter enjoys being close to me and shes comfortable. I know I will get a lot of use out of my babybjorn."
3,Baby loves it!,"We were given an Ergo carrier but our son hated facing inward, so we got the Baby Bjorn Active. He loves it -- seems more comfortable for him, and it's easier to put on/off by yourself than the Ergo. I like that he can face either out or inward. Only negative is that it's uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. Use this for errands around town, wearing baby while doing chores -- but if you're going for a long walk, you'll want to opt for something else."
5,Great buy!,"This product is great for my 4 months old daughter, it is flexible good material, it is a great design, adjustable in any angle. It has a great support on your back which is very important. My wife loves it, she started started using it from day one."
5,Best product ever,I have used several different kinds of baby carriers and this one is by far the best one. Ideal for traveling with a baby.
4,Great!,We love this carrier. We had the other kind without the added back support and I couldn't use it for very long. The added support makes my 22lb. 6 month old much easier to carry around and she is very happy in it. You can turn her to face you and she will sleep or face out and she can look around. I use it all the time!
3,works well,Baby seemed comfortable but I am not sure about the excess straps that just dangle on the sides.
4,So simple and comfortable!,"I bought this product so that I could carry my son with me and keep him ""part of the action."" He loves facing forward and looking around at what's going on around us. For now, I just use it around the house, but I hope that in the spring, we'll use it more outside. I recently used the carrier on an airplane and was quite pleased. My son loves to suck on the material when he is facing forward, so I would consider purchasing the product liner. I have tried other baby carriers which were so complicated to use-with buckles and straps and snaps... The Baby Bjorn carrier is so simple to use- 1,2,3- buckle, slide, and fasten. Also, I find it very comfortable to wear due to the generous lumbar support. I feel safe knowing that my baby is harnessed securely. If you are considering purchasing a baby carrier, this is the one to buy. It's worth the investment."
4,Baby and I love the Bjorn,"This was the most useful gift we received for our baby. At a very young age, my son has exhibited the strong need to explore and see different things. Since he can't crawl yet, it's imperative that he be carried around so he'll be entertained. Enter the Bjorn, a must have in my book.Pros: Easy to use, easy to clean, offers great support for baby's back and neck. Some reviews noted it offers little or no back support for the person carrying the baby. Our little one is over 20 lbs now and I still use this more than our jogger when hiking. My shoulders feel sore, but my back felt good with some minor adjustment on the lumbar support.Con: I wished the front panel was expandable. My baby is a bit, uhm, round in the middle, and on times when it's cold outside and he has a sweater on, the front panel becomes harder to hook in."
2,"Hard on the back, but easy to put on and use.","My son is 7 weeks old and already over 13 pounds. The Bjorn is uncomfortable for me after about an hour of wearing him in it - all his weight is carried by my shoulders and the so-called lumbar support really doesn't do too much. Also, I have read it is not great to carry an infant hanging by his/her crotch with the feet dangling.I got an Ergo Baby Carrier instead and I love it so much more - it doesn't allow the babies to look out like in the Bjorn, but my baby doesn't mind, and the Ergo can be worn on my back when my baby can hold his head up better. In the Ergo, his weight is distributed on my hips mostly and it makes him feel so much lighter than when he is in the Bjorn. Plus, it fits my 6'5"" husband and the Bjorn does not. I am going to sell my Bjorn!"
2,Not Different Enough,"I bought this carrier hoping for some additional back support. My daughter loves being in the original Baby Bjorn, but I can only handle it for so long. I wanted to find a carrier that she enjoyed equally but that gave me some extra support. This carrier did not achieve that goal. I ended up returning it.This carrier is simply not that different from the original. I really do like the original one, and I switch off using that with another carrier (the AWESOME Sleepy WrapSleepy Wrap Baby Wrap Carrier -Gray, also available on Amazon). We are now also experimenting with the Ergo."
5,A must have for new moms and dads!,"This item is a lifesafer. It makes shopping or going out and about with your little one very easy. It made me nervous to put the infant carrier in the shopping cart seat like some do...the baby bjorn offers a safe and comfortable alternative. Not only did I have free hands, but my son loved being able to have a clear view of everything. You can use rear facing ( for when baby is really little.. under 11Ibs) and forward facing when they can hold there head up. My son is just 20 pounds and I still use the carrier comfortably. Keep it in your car for those quick, unexpected stops at the store..."
5,My baby loves it,My son does not like the stroller or the car seat but he doesn't cry in the baby carrier. He loves facing the crowd. I used it while I was on vacation in Puerto Rico and it was very handy especially when I was hiking in the rain forest. I also use this at home while I'm working around the house. It's worth the price.
5,Baby Bjorn with lumbar support,Great front carrier! I found the lumbar support much more comfortable than the old style that I used with my first child. My back is thankful.
5,Easy to get around,At first it was hard to figure out how to use it but once I got the hang of it I use it all the time. Where ever I go my baby goes and baby doesn't mind it as long as I am walking around. I am so glad to finally get things done and baby is happy.
4,a must have!!!,"This has saved me so many times. Have you ever been home alone and your little one will not let you put them down so you can do some essentials around the house???? This has been a lifesaver for those situations. I have been able to water my plants, fold laundry (takes a bit more time when he grabs the clothes I'm folding), make dinner, clean bottles, etc. The key is to start them early so they get use to being in the carrier. My son has never had an issue with being in it, he really loves it b/c I think he feels like he can see more and be apart of what is going on. I'm not sure if the back support really supports your back, it doesn't seem any different than others I have tried."
3,Less than 15lbs.,"I purchased the Bjorn Active and it was great. But when my son reached 15lbs and up it became uncomfortable and painful to wear. Finally when he hit 20lbs we went with the Ergo which is a lifesaver! The Bjorn was nice because it kept my son close to my body and when he could hold his head up he loved facing forward. Again, it was fine at first but it was a bit expensive. There are tons of baby carriers and slings that are worth looking into."
4,A must have!,"The ""active"" version with ,lumbar support is definately superior to the other Bjorns. I use this for hours at a time for everything from housework to shopping to walks and my daugher loves it. It is well constructed and made with durable and heavey duty fabric. It also washes easily (but fades a bit). I am petite and it provides good supprort (she is now 18 lbs). We also have the black and white Bjorn without the lumbar support and my upper back and shoulders tire much faster. The only thing that is bad about this product is the price - buy this online or at a second hand store if possible (they are usually more than half the retail price and never too worn out since they are so durable). This is a must have for newborns and infants."
5,Incredible practical,"This Baby Bjorn Baby Carrier solved both, my life and my daughter's life. My baby didn't like to be by herself in the swinger or sitted in the stroller. All she wanted to do is to be in my arms. I had to carry her all day long and of course wouldn't be able to do anything. Now she's all day carried by me in the Baby Bjorn and I feel free and able to do lots of things in the house. I highly recommend this Baby Bjorn for active mothers like me."
4,A must have for moms and dads,"Set aside the obvious reasons for purchasing a baby carrier, the BABYBJORN Carrier is definitely worth consideration. It is well a made product, with good stitching and sturdy fabric. The carrier is comfortable to wear, even for extended periods of time. Essentially, it is the same as having an extra set of arms to hold your baby. The carrier is a little cumbersome to adjust after putting it on. The lumbar support is difficult to position and can create slack in the should straps. There are no instructions or diagrams in regards to lumbar support positioning and adjustment. This is the only element I have a complaint with, and the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. However, once the straps and lumbar support have been adjusted properly, the carrier is a priceless help concerning daily baby care. I would highly recommend this product to all parents, new or experienced."
4,Yay baby carrier,"I've been looking for a good baby carrier for a while now. When my daughter was born I bought the moby wrap for her, and though she did enjoy it, it gets very very hot wearing her in the moby wrap. So since Costco had a sale on the ErgoBaby, I tried, that and my daughter just wailed the whole time I had her in it. So I returned that and decided to give the BabyBjorn a try, daughter LOVES it. She's seven months now and loves being held facing out, but when she's sleepy I flip her around and she just passes out. Love it.I'm giving this 4 stars because of the fact that if I wear her long enough, my left shoulder start hurting, but I'm not quite sure if it's my fault or if it's the carrier's fault, so I'm gonna keep trying to see if it gets better after a few more wears. But I'm really excited about this because my daughter loves being in it and that makes me happy, even though I kinda hurts me after a while. :)"
3,too much going on,this has too many straps and things on it it takes me too long putting it on and adjustments and pulling and tighting cliping and cinching total pain in the a*# and dont let it fool you no back support the back support thing wont even stay in place dont waist your money if i could do it over i would have bought the orignal less stuff easy on easy off
3,Bjorn Active,"I'm a fan of the Bjorn, we have an original that was handed down, however it doesn't have some of the new features of the newer ones.....so we do a lot of hiking and was looking for one that would be easier on the back. This had the lumbar support, so I gave it a try. After wearing it around the house for a few days, the baby and I didn't care for it. It is still easy to put on but I really didn't get the back relief that I was hoping for, it's a bit more bulky than the original as far as putting it in your bag, the fold down front didn't seem to be as low as the original Bjorn, which the baby didn't like. Maybe I'm just used to the original one but this one had a lot of straps to try and get the right fit. All in all, I sent it back and just going to get another original Bjorn until the baby gets big enough for a backpack carrier."
2,Much better carriers out there,"Baby Bjorn was the pioneer for baby carriers 10 years ago but since then there has been an explosion in the market - slings, front carriers, pouches, etc. The BEST, in my honest opinion, is the Ergo. The baby sits with correct posture (The Bjorn is not so great for the baby's spine) and the parent is not in pain! I can walk for hours with my 20 lb baby in the Ergo -- not so in the Bjorn."
4,Definately adds back support,"We have a GIANT baby and are so grateful to have more back support when we carry him around. The only down side is that with more back support comes more straps and such to adjust. When my husband and i use the Bjorn alternatively, it takes a few minutes to get it to fit right. Happy (and pain free) walking!"
5,Great carrier!,"My baby didn't like it much until he was about 2 months old. We took it traveling in the airport and it was great. Now that he is 4 months, I put him in it to go for walks or just around the house. The back support helps to even out the weight. It's very comfortable."
5,Worth the extra money,"I bought the original version of the baby bjorn - and had terrible back pain, even for walks around the house. I was nervous spending the extra money for a second one - but went on the advice of a friend who was using the active carrier to take her baby on long walks, without back pain.I am glad I took her advice. The support straps make all the difference. You have to keep it tight around you to get the benefit of the support, but if you tug them tight each time you put it back on - it really takes the pressure off. I walked three miles yesterday and my baby is 16 pounds - and I felt no pain when I got home. It was worth the money -even the second time around."
2,Fine if you just want a carrier for a newborn,"Don't be fooled into thinking that this carrier is the best by the sheer number of them out there. We were given one by our parents when our son was born and it was fine for the first few months. However, as soon as he hit 15 lbs the shoulder pain became unbearable when wearing him for more than 5 minutes. We did an incredible amount of research and switched to an Ellaroo Mei Hip (also available on Amazon) and have never looked back. They are incredibly comfortable and shift the weight to the hip instead of the soft part of the shoulder. (Our friend has the Ellaroo Mei Tai carrier for her newborn and loves that too.)Again, this isn't a bad carrier, it just isn't that functional afte rthe first few months. Its also padded in such a way that it is difficult to fold it up small enough to carry in the diaper bag and still have room for other stuff."
5,it works better than original one!,I like this baby carrier a lot. I tried few other carriers but i can say the back support really helps. I am a tall person and my baby is heavier than avarage babies. I traveled overseas with him when he was 5 months and it was so comfortable. It wasn't a problem carrying him and two carry-ons at the same time at the airport. I recommend this item.
1,not worth it,I thought I am buying the best one on the market but from day one my son never fit in it right. He is 8 weeks old and I used it once. When he was couple of weeks old at almost 10 pounds he was very very tight in it and now at 8 weeks we have to put him face front and he is still tight in the carrier. Don't recommend it!
2,hurts my back,"This worked fine until my baby was about 10 pounds. Then my back started killing me on our long walks. So I bought the Ergo carrier, which is much better. My baby is now 10 months old (about 18 pounds) and she loves being in the Ergo. And I love the Ergo too, because puts the weight on my hips and feels great even on our long walks."
5,Can't live without!,"Borrowed my sisters Bjorn and was hooked. I have 3 kids and have tried them all, wish I would have started here. It offers great support and my baby loves it. Been using it from birth until now (almost a year) LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I tell all my mommy friends its a must have.** Also a little tip, if you are a nursing mother you can loosen one sides straps and discreetly nurse. I just put a cover on and baby and I are good to go.Best $100 I've spent on baby so far."
4,Much better for the back,"My baby is now 20 pounds and my back can't take carrying her in the original anymore - even a short trip to the grocery store was getting too much. The lumbar support makes a big difference (for some reason for my upper back mostly), but still a bit sore in the traps on long walks. She loves it, and the front flap stays down great, in contrast to what another reviewer said. I did notice I have to tighten it quite a bit for the back support to work, but don't even notice it once we get going. I am 5'7 and 140 if that makes a difference."
4,Great product,"The only thing I would change was I wish the shoulder straps were a little padded, they tend to press into my collarbone and it gets sore when I where it for long periods. That is the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Other than that, I LOVE it! The back support is great and I can where it much longer than any other carrier I have had before. My baby is now 10 months old and I still put him in it all the time, he loves it. It is so easy to take on and off and even lay him down if he falls asleep."
2,Ubiquitousness does not equal greatness,"I got this carrier because I have seen it everywhere, so I figured it must be good. I am writing this review in an attempt to save you from making the same mistake I made.Baby Bjorn carrier active:PRO:-only carrier I have found where baby can face outCONS:-weight of baby is not evenly distributed, so nearly all of baby's weight pulls on your shoulders (very painful)-baby must be at least 8 lbs (slings and Ergo carriers take any size)-the fabric doesn't breathe, so you both get sweaty even in cold weather-there are 3 large strips of fabric that hang down, getting in the wayIf you are looking for a comfortable, easy to use, versatile carrier that can be used for all ages as both a front, side and back pack, get the Ergo: ERGO Baby Carrier w/ Solid Lining - Black w/ Green. Wrap carriers seem great, too, but I never could figure out all the straps.Good luck and happy carrying!"
5,Great Product,"We have a 6 month old son and we have been using this carrier since he was a week old. I think this is a great product. I tried a Moby wrap sling and Infantino side carrier and Infantino 6-in-1 carrier and they just can not compare to BabyBjorn. It's so easy to put on! The fabric is soft enough for the baby, but hard enough so you can adjust the straps every timie you want it. We adjust a lot, because 3 people in the household use it and we all are of different built. We use it at least twice a day when walking our dog.It is easy on my back as compared to the ones I mentioned above. I can not compare with a classic BabyBjorn though, but we bought this one becuase of Amazon reviews.I would recommend to buy BabyBjorn bibs for the time when your baby starts riding face out and chewing on the front flap. But even if you don't the carrier is easy washable."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought it because of all the good reviews but it is not worth the money. It made my shoulders and neck stiff and I couldn't use it more than 15 minutes at a time. Save your money, shoulders and neck and don't buy it."
2,Lumbar support does nothing,"I got this based on the fact that everyone seems to have a BabyBjorn. It is useful for the first few months since it's easy to use and provides head support. However, I abandoned it as she got older since the weight of the baby rests entirely on the shoulder muscles making it painful after a short time of walking. The lumbar support doesn't really do anything since the weight stays on your shoulders anyway. Definitely not worth spending the extra for it. I have since purchased a different baby carrier that distributes weight mainly to the hips. This was really useful for travelling as I can walk around for hours with her on and not feel anything other than sore feet from walking."
4,A World of difference,I have been using the Baby Bjorn Active for over a month now and I love it. I had a snuggli before that and it was killing my back. My baby is now 3 1/2 months and I just find this carrier comfortable and easy to manage and I can keep her on for longer periods of time without having back pain.
3,Great for little babies,"I tried 3 babyborn carriers today, this being one of them. fit is comfy, but my 11 month old 21 pound, 31 inch tall daughter is too BIG for this carrier. Seems like it would work fine for younger babies, up to I'd say 6 months."
4,Great Gift Item,This was requested on a baby registry for a shower I was attending. From a gifting perspective this item arrived quickly and arrived in a very small box. I removed the item to see that it was in good condition and was very impressed with the design. This item allows you to carry your child in the most natural position possible while being extremely lightweight so that it does not bulk when carrying your child.
1,Wobble wobble wobble,Weak singing of boneless music by overrated musician for lazy listeners. Otherwise fine.
4,Superb...,"Never disappointing. No matter what your age, or what genre of music you enjoy... this is a great cd for background music or long scenic drives!"
5,"Amazing, as is all Bocelli",This album does not disappoint at all. I might even say it is his best so far. So go out and buy it!
3,Good I guess...,"It's been four years since I bought this and today it is not even in my iTunes Library. Therefore it must not have been that memorable or I would have ripped this CD and added it to my collection.I like Andrea Bocelli, though this one must not be one of his better albums judging by the fact that I haven't listened to it in three years."
5,Great Music!,The track 'Il Mistero dell'Amore (The Mystery of Love)' was the primary reason why I bought this CD. I wished this particular piece was longer. The other tracks are OK. I have had this CD in my car for several months and I find it very relaxing.I highly recommend 'Incanto' for reviewers who find Bocelli's voice rather bland or boring.
5,Wife loves this cd!,"Ok, guys hate chick flicks right? I would categorize this as a chick cd. My wife loves this guy. Let's just say it's a great mood setter as well. Because of that I have to give this guy five stars. The guy has a tremendous voice. I grew up on Pavarotti, but Bocelli can belt out a song. My wife likes the fact that he's not to ""opera-ish."" Also own Romanza and Sogno."
3,Cieli di Toscano,"I have enjoyed all of Andrea Bocelli's recordings and tapes tremendously; play them over and over, so it is with a sad heart I must say Andrea what happened? After listening 4-5 times I cannot find one song,except the lullaby, that I enjoyed.,but will keep listening to Romanza and Sogno."
2,Come on people....,"Bocelli is a vastly overrated singer with shockingly little talent when you get right down to it. It works on some of the real crossover stuff he sings (like with Sarah Brightman), but not on this CD. The magic of the producer and modern technology cannot overcome Bocelli's inherent mediocrity. Not worth the money."
3,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING,"Heard it, didn't like it. First song very good but sounds generic after the third or fourth song. Nothing to beat The Song of The Earth."
2,"too serious,too mandane,too nasal--shame Bocelli","I am a Bocelli fan and a lover of opera. I purchased his new cd with gusto and I am very disappointed. The music ,selection of songs were like depressants(and I do not do drugs). No variation of sound or voice. Whats going on?>?Did the artist have a cold.He sounded very nasal and it was very annoying especially since I can't return the cd. I think it is awful and Irritating."
1,A ridiculous offense against good singing!,"Another hideous travesty unleashed against a public who, by now, should know better. Bocelli's voice and abilities at musical interpretation are absurdly substandard by any metric and even the miracles of 21st century signal processing cannot improve the thoroughly annoying sound of his voice and his feeble attempts at evoking emotion. The overdone instrumental accompaniment only accentuates the comic aspects of this magnificently inadequate rendition.Anyone who would prefer to listen to this ineffable rubbish over a ninety year old recording of Caruso deserves it."
1,malavoce,"Here's the truth: What little voice he once had is now gone. He will sing a few bars and then rely on the instrumentalists in his group (i.e., the flutist, violinist, etc.) to fill in the rest. His range has shrunk; his tone, always thin and reedy, has diminished almost to the vanishing point. His forays into opera have stretched his limited resources to the point of collapse, and, worst of all, he has become even more tedious and dull. I once thought of him as the Yanni or John Tesch of Italian pop, but that would be an insult to those men now. He needs to hang it up, but as long as there are the tone-deaf and uninformed in the public, willing to purchase his recordings, I guess he'll stick around."
5,Molto Bene,"Sempre con la musica di Bocelli nel cuore, una voce singulare - I always have Bocelli's music in my heart, such a unique voice."
2,Bocelli,"I think that Bocelli has a pleasant voice, but as a musician he is unprofound, unsophisticated, and ordinary. Because he has no passion or fire in his voice, he comes across boring. I think this CD was successful because the pieces he chose appeal to the general public. In my opinion, this CD will be good for somebody who enjoys pleasant background music; however, it is not recommended to somebody who seeks high quality classical music."
3,"Nice, but...","I have nothing against Mr. Bocelli, but he shouldn't be called an operatic tenor, as many have called him. His voice is really too weak. Can you imagine him being able to stand up to a full orchestra without a microphone? Impossible! And he lacks control of his voice; his vibrato is all over the place. I'm sure he's a very nice guy, but give me Pavarotti and Domingo any day. At Mr. Bocelli's level, I'd prefer Josh Groban."
2,Nothing new under the sun,Anything by Andrea is worth listening to right? Well no. This CD lacks the spirit and soul of previous recordings. It is at best tepid and at worst boring. I did not care for any of the songs and when Andrea sang of a thousand moons I could only think of a thousand reasons to return this CD.
2,Disappointing This Time,"Andrea is such a talent, but he misses the mark this time. The tunes are pretty, but what happened in the studio is puzzling. For most of the collection Bocelli's voice is very weak and the instrumentals overpower him, upsetting the balance. There is little of the energy and power displayed so beautifully in Sogno and Romanza, in fact, the musicians seem bored. Try again Andrea."
2,Honestly.,"I have heard Mr. Bocelli sing before and I don't believe all the audiences he's reached. Fine, he has talent but also horrible training, and his voice isn't felxible at all. All of you should try to listen to Caruso or di Stefano then you will hear a big difference. Honestly, if he wasn't blind he wouldn't be famous. The truth hurts."
5,A spiritual celebration of Italy; music that elevates you,"If you've ever been to Italy, you'll find an echo with Bocelli's passion for Toscana, for Italy. If you haven't been to Italy, buy the video too, and you are bound to be swept away by the soaring music, breathtaking landscapes and the unfettered enthusiasm for life. His voice reflects the essence of the Italian culture: simple, earthy, passionate and enchanting(qualities that make the rest of Europe envious). The duet ""L'Abitudine"" with Helena is the best track, but all the songs in this CD will lift your spirits and take you onto a dreamy spiritual journey."
5,"""The Clouds of Tuscany"" is an emotional masterpiece","Pull from your memory the most wonderful moment you've ever had- and remember how you felt- awe at how much beauty there is in the world, and how much there is to enjoy. Having trouble? Then pop this CD in and let Andrea Bocelli take you there. This is the second CD of his that I own, and I am very pleased with it. Andrea has such emotive vocals- full of passion and strength. I like all the songs on this CD- but Chiara is my favorite. If you like being moved by your music, then this CD is for you!"
5,Wonderful,"It's not opera, and maybe there are others with better voices, but this album is beautiful from beginning to end. I play it all the time and it is soothing to the soul. I'm glad he didn't share any of the songs with other artists. There are no gimmicks, no wierd passages, nothing to interrupt the flow of the music or disturb the listener.I've since purchased two other albums by Mr. Bocelli, and I think this is the best I've heard so far. I will be watching for future releases."
3,It is as good as the original one,"This is mostly parts of another DVD they put out years ago, using clips from it for the deceased singers. It is good, but mostly reissuing music already paid for in previous DVD's/"
5,Great Book,"This book is one of the best that I have read. While not as hands on (technical) as some, it goes into great depth in many areas of interest and takes an approach much different than other authors. Complete with many unique pictures, all in all, this book lacks nothing and is highly reccomended for anyones library collection. Travis...."
5,Purfect!,"It was exactly as it was stated and came perfectly on time. Thanks so much for a great ""lovely"" that my daughter adores."
5,My daughter can't live without these taggies,"Like many newborns, my daughter eventually gravitated to this blue doggie and the rest is history. In order to be sure her ""comfort"" was always taken care of I ordered 3 extra so that as these wear out through teething, and being dragged around all over our house. Needless to say we now have 6 blue doggie fleece taggies in reserve.Matt B"
4,I couldn't possibly!,"Wenzel takes us to a time in NY that is long gone, both in NY and Marion's. Smoking in bars, the Lower East Side vs the East Village and just plain NY fun. Her book is insiteful, entertaining and she is candidly open about her personal crisis. Run! don't walk for Behind Bars."
5,Bartenders that rock!,"I finished Wenzel's Behind Bars last week and found myself using the recipes this week at a party I had. It was nice that she included some of her best ones. The book was incredibly satisfying that it was a fast read, fun and interesting in that it gives a brutally honest insider look at a job that looks so fun. I always had a regret that I never bartended so living vicariously through Behind Bars was fun. Her Islamic background was an interesting foil to the Manhattan bar life she describes so well. This urban memoir is a must for anyone who ever drank or mixed at a bar. I'll be going back to it for tips on how to get the bartender's attention, how to hit on girls that don't annoy them and most of all, again, the recipes for cool classic cocktails. Very enjoyable summer read."
1,A New Low in Rant Lit,"What was St. Martins Press thinking? Unbelievably bad writing by a person with absolutely nothing to say. It is unfocused, repetitive, and completely lacking in anything resembling insight, and not even a particularly accurate portrayal of a bartender's life. At least, not the ones I know - and I know a lot. In fact, it kinda makes me sad I ever set foot in Marion's Continental; if Wenzel were still working there, I wouldn't.If you're looking for something to read, read the back of your cereal box. It's better."
3,Marginal,"I bought this book nearly three years ago because as a bartender and aspiring writer, I wanted someone else's take on what the lifestyle can be like. I loaned it to a fellow bartender after I finished it and in some ways I agree with his comments that he liked the book a bit, but didn't like the author at all. Her comment about bartending schools ""...unless you're stupid enough to have gone to one."" is insulting. Her being arrogant enough to name a drink and think that it deserves a place in bartending history, is just that - arrogant. The book is not all bad and it's a nice, light read - just don't take what she says as the gospel of what it's like for even most bartenders."
2,A few anecdotes does not a book make,"As a former bartender I hate to say something bad, but how much experience can a person get in two bars across 10 years? We never see behind the scenes of a hosted bar (tipping, forget it), we never see the true interaction of a bartender and cocktail server, we rarely hear the full scoop. Serving in a restaurant bar is different than a hotel bar, an airport bar, a nightclub, a race track (my least favorite)."
2,"Some interesting tips, but terrible writing/editing","I thought I'd enjoy this book, and I got about halfway through it before the terrible writing and editing got to me. There were liquor brands spelled wrong in the recipes. Ty uses the exact same word, ""wrecked,"" to describe how she feels ""after a shift"" throughout the entire book. You get the feeling she doesn't expect you to remember characters introduced earlier, because she reminds you about them. She never describes how she met her husband, although she refers to it many times. Certain sentences don't follow the rules required to go by that name. There were a few touching moments and some good tips, but I would not recommend it for a straight-through read. Maybe it'd be better browsed."
5,Wonderful!,"I never ever read, but I LOVED this book. Ty is amazing. You feel like you know her and want to know her. Read this even if you hate to read. She's brilliant."
2,Long winded...,"The idea for this book is great. There were some very interesting part such as the pranks and sexual escapades with bar patrons and fellow employeesHowever the the book drags horribly. In one section if the book, the author states that a bartender is a poor man's therapist you should tip the therapist accordingly for listening to your sob story. Ahem, Ms. Wenzel...I feel like you owe me a tip for listening to your sob stories."
3,"Lovely sound, bland performance (+ awful Wunderhorn)","Because of Shirley-Quirk's major wobble in his voice and humorless unidiomatic singing, the Wunderhorn collection on this Philips two-fer is a nonstarter. Norman is in fresh voice, but she sounds a lot more interested in being Jessye Norman than in interpreting Mahler.The Ninth Sym. is the main attraction, and it's beautifully played and recorded. The interpretation is literal and low-key, as Haitink too often tends to be. The first movement is brisk, without any pauses for phrasing or lingering to catch an emotional moment. The other movements are straight-ahead time-beating; the finale in particular makes almost no emotional impression, far from the wrenching farewell intended by Mahler. Even at a bargain price I can't see that the Concertgebouw's gorgeous playing is enough to justify a purchase."
3,Really cute...,"REALLY CUTE, RUNS A LIL SMALL I'M A SIZE SIX AND I HAD TO BUY THE LARGE. REALLY SHORT.BUT VERY CUTE...THE BRA DOESNT OFFER ANY SUPPORT WHAT SO EVER"
4,"Very realiable ""wepon""","This is a very well built side arm. with practice you can get a pretty nice 10 rounds per minute (6 second reload time). Additionaly, this has incredible stopping power for a Nerf. Its laser is not the most accurate thing in the world but will give you the possision of the landing mark plus or minus 3 or so inches. I rely mainly on its two orange slabs on top for aimimg. line them up and it will give the possision of your dart within a 1 inch diameter. It is a very fun toy however it can create a loud sound when fired. Has practicaly no recoil. Very drable and very worth the amount of money. HOWEVER, additional ""mini darts"" are a must as sometimes the dart travels at such a high speed it may bounce off targets into unknown areas. Hope this helps you all, very much so worth it. =)"
4,"Cool,Man!",I bought this toy and liked it right away. It is very accurate at short range but you have to push the micro darts in until they are tightly in the barrel. The included target is easier to hit with this gun than any other. The darts are easy to lose but you can buy refill packs. I would recommend this toy to anyone.
4,"For the price, a really great gun.","For $8, I thought, this must not be that great. I bought 2 on the spot, and took them home. Boy, was I wrong.Out of the box, it's already got some great distance, but once you modify it, you can get double that. Band it for an extra 10 or 15 feet. Of course, the light os only useful at the stock(out of the box) distance. So what do you do? Cut it off. It takes half of the weight off the gun, and it will fit into a holster. This is an easy gun to modify, shoot, reload, and cock.If you're debating on buying this, wait no longer."
2,BIG deal?,"Aw, come on-- This product is NOT 10"" x 12"" x 16"" and weighs a pound.More like 12"" x 3 1/2"" x 1"" and a few ounces.It's been a huge problem getting an honest description of this product before purchase, all the more important because there are 2 versions with identical bar code numbers:The original, FLAT, 2 SIDED, with 2 attractant vials, active part about 12 inches both sides.The cheaped-down version with about 1/4 the active surface, CURVED, 1 SIDED, 1 attractant vial, active part about 8"" one side.To be more irritating, the old description often accompanies the new version, and only a picture of the package, not the actual product.The old version worked great, loved it. The new version poops out before the flies do, I felt ripped off. I won't be buying this product again without a specific guarantee that it is the original, and exactly as described.(I would include pictures of both versions of the item, but no provision to do so is provided.)"
4,Rebuilt '95 XLT,I bought this book several years ago for a 1990 Indy 500. Over the years i've went through three sleds. This book helps even the clumsiest mechanic feel like there is nothing they can't fix.
2,Not What I'd Hoped For,"Given Greene's world-class reputation, I assumed I was in for a treat -- or at least a solidly diverting yarn. Unfortunately I found myself aching to put this book down and pick up something else. The story is about an assassin working for munitions suppliers who kills an influential British anti-war figure in the days leading up to WWII. He is betrayed and races to confront his betrayers before the police catch up with him. Sounds like good stuff, but for some reason it isn't. Part of the problem is that Greene gets sidetracked into painting little portraits of every peripheral character encountered. While well-fleshed out characters are required ingredients for any good story, Greene goes overboard and the story drags and suffers as a result. Next time I'll try one of his more famous books."
5,My favourite book on the Family,"Christian Living in the Home remains my favorite book on the family. It has been a great blessing to my wife and me. Jay Adams writes in a clear way; moreover, he presents a biblical and practical picture of the Christian family."
5,Wealth,"This classic is a wealth of insight and advice for nurturing a devout life. It predates and foreshadows the call for all to be saints at Vatican II and by faithful like Pope John Paul II and Saint Josemaria Escriva to sanctify the ordinary. This is a powerful and profitable book for our times from the great evangelist who won many back to the Catholic faith from the Protestant reformation. For the historical value as a classic it is well worth reading but as a practical devotional toward a truly devout life even today, it is a priceless treasure of the faith."
5,Introduction to the devout life,"I ordered this book knowing that it was used. The cover was slightly worn and there was some water damage, but on the whole it was I thought, in very good condition. And the price was very inexpensive. The book was shipped promptly, so I am very pleased with the service and the book. I am looking forward to reading it. Thank you."
5,"Like all other reviews, this thing SUCKS...","...in a good way of course. I always feel these kind of automated gadgets are a waste of money because they never work as advertised. But after seeing all these positive reviews in Amazon, I decided to order mine.I am very happy with this purchase. I have a back pain problem due to a car accident and I always feel uncomfortable having to bend my back to get the dustbin and collect the dirts. Now with this tiny monster, I can just sweep the dirts to its opening and it'll automatically sucks in the dirts, from hair to dusts to coffee beans, etc. And it is powerful enough to even sucks in a standard sized facial tissue. I love this machine. Buy now before it's too late."
4,Nice Picker,"This gadget picks up dirt and small pieces of trash swept under it. It does what it says, however I wish is was little less noisy and had a more powerful vacuum and the timer can be controlled. But for a first try, this is great. We have a Roomba and we like it. So I guess, Westinghouse is trying to get into the market on the edge."
3,noisy,This is working ok - but is noisy and the filter needs cleaning often - dust clogs the filter quicklyBut it does what I wanted - and is easy to clean - it is little bulky -A 3 may be unfair because I don't have anything to compare it to.
2,Work but too loud,This is a good idea problem is the vacum has no sound insulation to it's as loud as my craftman 5hp shop vac...suggest ear protection.
5,Great Gadget,I didn't know if this would really work as well as it said...But I read alot of positive reviews...LOVE IT....Works as well as it states..very easy to clean out and I like how small it is. This is a great product for the money.
2,Buy a good dust pan instead,"At first this was fun to use, but after the novelty wore off, it's just in the way. The hole that sucks up the dirt is less than an inch in diameter, so you have to move the dirt around to get it directly under the suck hole in order for the dirt to go into the machine. I never can get all of the dirt to be sucked up.I purchased a really good dust pan (it's the kind janitors use with a broom stick attached - about $10ish from Sams)- it does much better, and i still don't have to bend down."
4,Pretty Good Product,"Unit shipped quickly and arrived in new condition. Setup was a no-brainer and unit worked as advertised. Motor is a tad bit loud, but it works !"
3,Not that great,"I bought this based on the reviews I read in Amazon. Seemed like a good concept, you sweep the stuff at the vacuum and it is supposed to suck it up. Well, you have to get it within a half inch of the opening which is only about 2 inches wide. So you end up trying to push the stuff with a broom into this little hole. The vacuum finally turns on and the birds in the trees outside fly away, the cats run for safety under the beds, and the babies next door start crying... it is that loud. Turns out it is easier to do it the old fashioned way...just get a dust pan with a long handle and pick the dust up and deposit it in the trash can."
5,This thing sucks!,"We got this for the girls in the beauty shop.It works perfectly!They just sweep the hair clippings (wet or dry) under the unit and whoosh, it's gone.The unit is smaller than I thought it would be, that turned out to be a good thing. It holds an entire day's clippings of a busy shop. They empty it out at night and it's ready for the next day.It is a little loud, but it only runs for 5 seconds at a time, so it's not a nuisance.They would buy another one in a minute!"
4,review the sweepEZE,I initially bought this as a joke for my husband. After using it my family loves having it around. We have hardwood throughout our home and just takes a sweep around each room then over to the sweepeze for pick up. My son said we need one for each room. This is easy to empty and has great suction for even the finest of dirt like flour spilled on the floor.
4,Great fun for a little price,"My daughter got this for her 2nd birthday and she just LOVES it!!! The pieces are easy for her to handle and although the paint is quite messy (of course) it's a great way to spend time with her and be creative at the same time. We bought a big roll of plain white wrapping paper and she's making her own Wiggles paper for a couple of birthdays for friends coming up. I did think at first it was an ink pad stamper set, so be aware that it does come with paint."
2,Don't get wrong,if you get this cd O RECORDS it's the same paying 6 dollar to paying 27dollars they are CD R not original ones don't waste so much moneyhot records do not sell original copies anymore I regret paying 26dollars I could have paid only 6 ...
5,"All around the town: A New York cookbook, with hundreds of recipes...",The best overall coverage of New York restaurants I've ever encountered. Wish I could find more like it that cover this period of time
4,GOOD FOR MOMS AND DADS,THis book is very good companion for those that do not have a clue in parenting and for those that think that know everything!It is a book for every day reading
5,Simply Fantastic,"By all means PLEASE purchase this CD. I came across this album a couple of years ago, and listened to it so frequently that I burnt out my copy and had to buy a second one. I even had the opportunity to see them perform live in Philly, which was also a phenominal experience. For such a young band, they had a great stage presence. I am not sure why some of these reviewers are down on this band, but I highly encourage you to purchase this album while it is available. I am quite distressed that the band members have gone their separate ways."
4,kickass,"I too saw Stage at Lupo's [come back to MA like you said you would, haha] and I'd agree with the others who said their live show was impressive..as for their album, I enjoy the first five tracks and as the CD goes on it seems to drag..but it's still good."
5,"Surprise,Surprise",I just heard the album for the first time and was very impressed with the group. Ryan Stahr has a fantastic voice and it is refreshing to hear a really good rock n roll band.They sing with conviction and alot of feeling. Buy the CD!!
5,REFRESHING,"This long awaited album release was well worth all the anticipation. It is absolutely refreshing to hear such a unique vocal range, accompanied with such a great energy. This album captures a lot of the incredible live energy of this band, an energy unmatched at any other live show I have ever attended."
2,true rock fans stay clear,"seriously though people, this band has a couple songs that are worth a listen. beyond that...stay clear of wasting your money on this one. it can only be described as disposable rock and to be completely honest, they don't really even ""rock"". like most new bands that just come and go in the blink of an eye, there is nothing musically that shows much talent or grabs you. the vocals leave much to be desired for and offer up nothing original. ask anyone who isn't a longtime ""stage-follower"" just trying to get their favorite bands records sold, and you will hear the same...they just aren't worth it."
1,This album sucks!!!!,"I acidentally purchased this album, thinking it was the next release for Greenwheel. I got it home, opened it up, and realized it was not. So, holding onto some hope, I played it. While the band has some good qualities, that lack TALENT, completely. IF I could send it back, I would, in pieces. I would demand a refund from the band."
1,Glad they broke up...if they really did.,"I'm pretty level-headed and fair in my reviews, but this seriously only deserves one star. This shouldn't be accompanied next to rock cd's in the ""customers who bought this also bought"" area. This is, well...garbage. Listen to the samples and you'll know what i mean. If you like hard rock OR catchy pop-rock OR even alt-rock, you'll be disappointed either way. More file 13 material."
1,nothing special,if you happen to land on this page just skip to the next band on your list because there is absolutely nothing special about this band...the singers voice is horrible non inspiring almost impossible to sit through...as for the actually music behind hte singing there really isn't much to be heard just all bland guitar and drums
2,biggest dissapointment to me,"this was one i really couldnt wait for when i heard that PM and co got signed to liberty. what a letdown- both in songwriting quality and yes, even production. i know AH got slammed for its production, but i dont hear anyone like TV on this recording, it could have been anyone. the songs are just so mediocre, what happened to paddy. i agree with the minority that claim that AH is the peak of paddys craft..how then could we come to this so quickly?? PM would redeem with the totally bizarre ITTMH, but i wish this man would rise again. he is a king despite this misstep."
3,Why has trashy country influenced our best acts?,"This is a completely contrived collection of country-influenced music by one of pop's better acts. What ever possessed them? Every last song has silly country lyrics. What is this, Prefab Spout's novelty country album? Were they mentally ill when they penned this? Drop the country boy act and do what you do best, guys!"
4,Paddy Pulls It Off,"If you're a Prefab Sprout fan, you will probably buy this CD regardless of what the reviews say. Luckily, Paddy has really put forth a fine effort. Although his last album, 'Andromeda Heights' has better songs, 'Gunman' is a stronger album. I probably cut Paddy more slack than other songwriters but I appreciate the fact that he takes chances and he really writes beautiful music. I miss Wendy, though."
1,If you take it out alot be prepared,I had this for 4 months and it just broke. The parts fell out were it plugs in and I feel as if you do take it out alot to swap be careful not to pull to hard. If you do it will break. Well I don't have alot of time while driving to switch so slow with my phone charger...you been warned tho.
2,Died after less than 4 months,"This product died on me after less than 4 months of daily use. I would frequently store the charger in my car overnight (as I'm sure most people would). The fan on the inverter would start up incredibly slow after a cold night. That was my first sign that this thing might not be able to last for very much longer. Eventually, the fan just made this high pitch whirring sound, like it was stuck, when it would power on. The plastic piece covering the fan became very hot to the touch. I would usually just move it around until the fan eventually stopped making the sound and the heat would slowly dissipate. The charger eventually shorted out (it literally sparked) and is now completely dead.The product worked great for the last four months. My THEORY is that the product is not designed to stand up to colder temperatures. You may not have my issue, but I expect an item that is designed for a car to last through mild desert winters."
4,bulky but great product,"Could have a longer cord, but I think I understand the need for short one. This thing is very useful for more than just hi electronic products. I love it. Wish it came with some apparatus to hold it steady. Great buy."
3,"Good for Charging, but...",OK - first off great purchase experience...received quickly at a great price. I just put it into use and have used it with my iPhone 3GS and a new ThinkPad laptop. It does a great job charging both products. Now for the bad...owing to the electronic buzz I cannot listen to music on the iPhone or the ThinkPad. Both play clearly when not plugged into the charging device. I still rate it a buy based on it's charging capabilities. Everyone should keep one in their car.
2,"Works fine, Fan is annoying","I had a different converter with USB and power for the last two years- worked silently and like a charm. Sent it off with a friend and needed to buy a new one. I have to say I am disappointed in how loud the fan is. I have a Toyota Echo, fairly road-noisy car, and at speeds less than 30mph I can hear this fan. It works fine, and does its job- just wish the fan was quieter. This isn't under load either, the fan seems to run even if nothing is plugged in.UPDATE 4/25/10 - A few months ago the fan started to make an incredibly annoying noise for the first 30 seconds or so fo operation then it settles down and goes back to be mildly annoying. I am knocking this down to 2 stars."
5,Vacation Rental Guide,"This was a great little book. Easy, quick read - lays out the questions to ask when considering a vacation rental in Italy. Definitely identified things I had not considered, that I will definitely include when narrowing down our rental."
4,wife's toolbox,These are quality tools and they tend to be smaller for smaller hands. I thoght the price was a little high. Deliverey was before Christmas whch was a pleasant suprise.
4,For Grandma,"Bought it for my 85 year old Mom to have around her house...she loves it and can always direct someone to it who asks for a simple tool....plus it looks ""girly""."
2,Barbara K! BK24214 30-Piece Signature Tool Kit,"The kit would be a good starter set for someone who does not have any tools. I can't say anything about the quality, but the tools in the kit were designed to be lightweight -so they don't feel like they would do a good job. I was interested in the kit because I thought it would be nice to have my basic tools together. But after inspection I do not like the way they look and feel."
3,great gift,My sister in law was soooo excited to recieve this. When she pulled the tape off that had been placed it left the case real sticky tho'.
4,This is the BEST,"This is the BEST tool set I have ever had, bar none. I love everything about it. It's compact, all of the tools fit my hands (which are quite small), the hammer is just the right weight and doesn't make my wrist hurt when I'm using it. The power screwdriver is a godsend. However, the interchangeable bits are a bit too short and I find them difficult to remove. If not for that, this would have gotten 5 stars. The carrying case is ingenious! It's light weight, compact, easily carried around, and satisfies those of us who like everything in it's place. Imagine, a magnetic measuring tape, and magnetic leveler. How cool is that? Barbara, thanks for designing this tool set for women who like to do our own work!"
5,Great For College Students,"I bought each of my daughters, in college, one of these for Christmas. They both have already found them very useful. One has put a desk together and hung blinds in her new apartment. The other took her's over to a friend's new apartment. She thought it was very convenient having all the tools you need in a nice little carrying case. I have recommended this tool kit to friends of mine who have daughters getting ready for college."
3,"It's close, very close to a four star book.","Having written seven books, two of which contain short stand alone stories, I can tell you that these types of books are not favorites with regular readers. If they're to find favor at all, each story had better have substance and come to a fulfilling conclusion. As an example of where this book failed to do that and lost a star, was a story about a helicopter crash that was witnessed by people close by, but afterwards, the crew could not be found in the wreckage are anywhere else. This story ask way too much of a reader. In this author's defense, he does say up front it's not the run of the mill Vietnam War book, and he's telling the truth.While my newest book, ""Kill Me If You Can"", is hated by Vietnam veterans, they know it's real."
4,Flawed but worthy,"We use this book to teach a one-quarter-long applied math class at a local community college. Although there are quite a few what seem to be transcription errors, the book does a fine job teaching the basics of mathematics up through simultaneous equations, right angle trigonometry, RLC Vectors, logarithms and computer number systems.A good book for electrical/electronics technicians."
1,Disappointed,This is a cd of original singing put to updated music. Sucks! I wish I knew that before I paid a dollar for it.
4,Pretty impressed,"Just bought this book to use in groups and loaned it to a colleague of mine before I read it. He said that it was wonderful and that I should go ahead and find the time to read it. He was right, this book is going to be enormously useful to me."
4,Speaking Spanish in the USA by Alberto Barugel,"As a PhD in Spanish and a bilingual teacher, I find this book to be a valuable tool for bilingual education and for University students majoring in Spanish. In addition, I believe it would serve Spanish teachers in comprehension of the neologies Spanish and Hispanic students are employing.Language is an evolving process, and as we accepted new vocabulary to the language in the past, we have to accept these new modern terms or at least acknowledge and recognize their meanings.I would recommend it highly as a reference book and or as a support for the traditional Spanish text book.Dr. Nechama Kramer-Hellinx"
3,Too big for a lapel pin,"Yup. It's a lapel pin, 1"" x 1"" . Too big for my taste, but it was exactky asdescribed ."
5,2008 Sierra Crew,"If you are not planning on lifting your truck or if you don't already own a really tall truck, you will look top heavy with these rails. They were almost as large as the factory step rails on my Sierra 1500. I am planning on keeping my truck factory size so the scale of these rails just looked a little off to me. I returned them and got the next smallest size Putco rails. Don't get me wrong, both rails look great. Amazon was great about the return and everything went very smooth. Happy in Minny. :)"
5,Great rails,Package arrived with hardware missing but a call to Putco and all was resolved the next day. Great customer service! Great looking rails set the finishing touch on my new Silverado.
3,Better Suited for Brits,"Lots of good anecdotal advise, even humourous at times. The chapter on goat health problems, poisons, and antidotes has proven useful, and is well organized. Genetic discussion on link between hornless goats and sexual malformity is thorough and necessary.However, the book is written for a British reader, and lots of the medicines, practices, and even forage crop names, are different in the US. (e.g. lucerne = alfalfa) Delves heavily into dairy goats and dairy farming, but meat goat farming (Boers, Kikos, etc.) is only cursorily mentioned. The section(s) on nutrition is excessive for the average goat farmer, and the copious information about UK regulations is useless to the US reader."
3,Surefire Crossbow,Much smaller product then I thought it was going to be. The darts don't shoot straight too often. Seems like the darts will fall apart in a month or so. The actual crossbow is built very well and the product should be fun for small children. Seems safe also
3,Fun until it breaks,"The crossbow is great fun and easy to use. However, the arrows break very easily, and the 'refills' cost more than the original bow did!"
5,GREAT BUY!!,"This was a GREAT purchase. The tunes are wonderful, the band is swingin' and Chet is in fine form. The performance of MY FUNNY VALENTINE is the absolute best version I have EVER heard. Each track is a delight but the DVD is worth the money just to hear that rendition of ""...VALENTINE"".. Amazing. It gave me chills. I can't get enough."
2,it is not a right fit.,"did not fit, had to make adjustments, had to cut it in few spaces to make it fit. will NOT fit 2009 routan."
5,Great fit and function,This product was a great choice for my vehicle as they fit very well and I was able to install by myself. They have performed very well in protecting my paint from dirt and road debris. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a great product at a great price.
1,not as advertised,"Said they were for Nissan 2012 Altima 2,5s , would have been a good price.However they in no way fit. Had three people attempt. finally gave up and returned."
3,Does not fit 2013 Forester,Does not fit a 2013 Subaru Forester. The mud flaps were well made and would be good if they fit your car. Amazon took them back at no cost to me.
4,Splash guards,I ordered these for my 2005 Lexus LS430 and they worked just fine on the front and rear and at a fraction of the costs of other mud flaps.
2,"Not a custom fit. May fit well, may not","Overall, not too happy. It was for an 06 charger and I was hoping for more of a custom fit. The company only makes 2 or 3 models of mud flaps which can be applied to a wide range of vehicles. The chart is on their website. the fit was not good for me. After I drilled and secured the mud flaps, It ended up to be crooked and did not look very good.Also the flap length is not very long. Maybe 3 inches.I did an experiment to test them. i installed one flap on one side and left the other slide off. I cleaned my rear bumper area on both sides and drove for about 100 miles with snow and salt on the road. I noticed no difference between the mud flapped side and the non mud flapped side. Oddly the side with the mud flap got dirtier....Overall I would not go with these unless you know that the install will fit well for your particular vehicle."
2,not-so-form-fitting,"the picture shows this fitting perfectly, but the actual splash guard has a pleat in it and presses tightly against the paint. It was bought as a gift for my partner's brand new car and after seeing how it would rub the paint, he said no, thanks. The shipping cost of returning it was too much, so I donated them."
2,Toyota Avalon Aftermarket Splash Guards,"These are not what I was expecting. They will fit my 2001 Toyota Avalon but are soft rather than ridgid plastic and as such cannot be successfully painted to match the car. I actually threw them both away and finally found the OEM splash guards (which are very hard to find). They are a much more ridgid plastic and hold paint very well without cracking.So, if you don't need to paint these flat black rubbery splash guards, they will do the trick for you but it you need to paint them, I'd pass."
3,powerflo 6401 splash guards,"they look good but don't really fit the 2010 grand vitara properly as far as mounting goes. I was able to use them with some by using some adaptive procedures so that I could mount them. they looked good on the vehicle when I got done so I was relatively happy with the way they turned out. when I ordered these splash guards on the website it stated that they would fit the 2010 grand vitara limited which is the information I gave them which is correct,but on the packaging the splash guards came in it stated that these fit vitaras except grand vitara. I would've sent them back but I still liked the way they looked that I decided to keep them. they do look like a factory fit if you make sure you order the right ones for your vehicle.Powerflow 6401 Pro-Fit Splash Guards-Car. 1 pair"
4,fit tight and look great,I have a 2001 Taurus I just bought and the cars in great condition so I wanted to get mud flaps for it.I bought a full set for the car. They went on easy and really mold to the car. The mud flaps are a thin rubbery plastic membrane that rests along the body that as you pull it in tight against the body of the car in contours pretty well.I then just screwed into the plastic into the car and they look fine. The mud flap is an interesting flexible material that holds up well and also if you hit Ice or snow clumps because it so flexible it will bend and go right back into place.Someone had a smart idea with these plus sell them for under 20.00. I am going to order another set for a Fusion I am confident they will fit nicely.
4,A good fit,"Recently, I bought a white vehicle and have been painstakingly cleaning the areas behind the wheels where all the dirt gets kicked up off the roads. I figured I needed these to save my sanity, but was blown away by how much the dealership was asking. So for 20% of that, I bought these.I was a bit alarmed by the fact that they do only come in a few different models, and that made me question if the fit could cover the range of about 75 vehicles that were listed for any particular model. For my 2013 Dodge Grand Caravan, I'm definitely pleased. You have to install them properly, but the flexible rubber does mold to fit the contour of your vehicle. I've seen a dramatic decrease in road grime that I must clean off the van as well.FYI, it took about 15 minutes per wheel to install. You have to take the tires off to do a proper job and you need a drill with a couple bits."
2,Camry 2012,"FYI, to those of you interested to buy this for Camry 2012 - it does not work although the site says they fit. They are too short and do not reach the holes left in the Camry to get them fixed to them. I did not want to drill to make it 'compatible'. I had to return them."
