1,Beware the salt!,"I gave this product a 1 because of the salt content. While not terribly salty, they are advertised as a no salt product, yet the label clearly lists sea salt as an ingredient.Most people wouldn't have a problem with this, but if you're on a sodium free diet like me, you could be just a few hand-fulls away from a trip to the emergency room."
1,The BAKED version of these chips is misleading and non-tasty,"Has soy grits and flax in it, not what you expect in chips, and not adequately labeled as such when purchasing. Not the usual corn taste, although it has some health benefits. It's just not what I expected/wanted, and won't buy again."
2,Blech,"These were not good at all... too spicy. Too ""limey""... the crunch factor was really awful... felt like my teeth were going to break. (Love the name... the chips were AWFUL!) Wound up throwing the bag away."
3,"Good chips, terrible packaging","Chips are good, but Amazon ships them in their original ""ready to ship"" box, which turns out is not really so ready for shipping. The box arrived in tatters; miraculously, the chips survived relatively intact. Hopefully will continue to be so lucky in the future."
4,Thin & crispy but too salty,"I love blue corn tortillas and their products. I had been eating the Guiltless Gourmet brand Blue Corn Tortilla Chips for many years but ultimately found their chips a bit thick & bland. I decided to try out Garden of Eatin, and I am glad I did. Thinner and crispier than the GG brand with a richer blue corn flavor. If I didn't know they were baked, I'd think they were fried! My only complaint is the excessive salt which is super obvious on a dark blue chip. I just brush the extra salt off but this can be a pain. I'd buy a salt-free option if they offered it in their baked blue chips, but they only offer it in the fried blue chips. For now, these'll do. I like eating dipping them into my homemade, low-salt guacamole- YUM!!"
2,Too salty and nearly expired.,"I ordered a case of these chips from Amazon because I like the regular Garden of Eatin blue chips and usually like baked chips better than fried. I ordered a case (and put myself on subscription) to get the best price and figured I could eat a couple of cases a year. But these chips are too salty - eating them actually burns my lips! And all of the bags in the case I received from Amazon on January 5 have ""best by"" dates of February 3, 2010. How am I supposed to eat 12 bags of too salty chips in less than a month? Since Amazon does not allow returns on this item, I'll probably just donate my case to the food bank. I highly recommend that before you order this item, buy a test bag at Whole Foods first. And don't order a case unless you can use it within a month. Learn from my experience!"
1,Filthy & Scratched,"This DVD said it was in very good condition, but it came filthy and scratched. I'm returning it ASAP. I thought I was ordering from a company that had pretty good reviews..."
5,"Ciao, faccia da scemo!","You'll love this book if you're the type of person that also enjoys reading National Geographic. This guide is packed with wonderful art, drawings, maps, photographs, and interesting text. It's really much more than a typical tourist guide. It helps one have deeper understanding of Napoli through an exploration of history, culture, geography, and geology. It's an especially great selection for those people planning to call Napoli home.RW - US Navy"
1,Disappointing,"The book was disappointing because several of the stories in the beginning of the book were repeated later on almost word for word, lending itself to boredom. It would have been more interesting if it had been written in the format of ""Wonder O' the Wind"" which was highly regarded."
1,Lessons from a Sheep Dog,"The write ups were misleading. I bought this book for my grandson, only to find it contained Christian propaganda. ""Obey the Master's voice"" ??? please..."
4,"Great book on working relationships, for anyone","Keller tells the story of his search for God's presence in his life trough an engaging story about his working relationship with his first sheepdog Lass. Well written, it was a quick read that I finished in one evening. The parallels between Keller and Lass and Keller and God are well thought out. I also enjoyed this book from the view of a manager. Keller wrote the book about the working relationship between God and man through the story of his dog, but, I found most of the ideas translate directly to managing of people. Good read. I highly recommend this book."
5,"Engaging, light read - recommend for all","This book is warm story that shows the relationship of trust and loyalty built between an abused dog and his new owner. I highly recommend it to any and all.Worthy of a re-read from time to time. Among other messages, a gentle reminder of the spirit of service we are all meant to demonstrate!"
1,Too many distractions from the dog's story,"I really didn't like this book mainly because it seems to focus more on religion that it does the dog. The author's mentioning of his beliefs and other religion elements take up at least half, if not more, of the book and it is a short book to begin with. If you are religous this book would probably get a high review because the part about the dog is okay, but it doesn't feel as if the book is really focusing on the dog, at least to me."
5,so worth it!!!,Just read this book a second time and am ordering it for myself. An amazing true story of a man and his dog; and the practical lessons he learns from God as he and his dog care for sheep. I want to read it again!!! Amazing!
4,"Good, quick read",Our book club read this selection along with another Keller book and both were quick yet thought provoking selections. The Christian based stories comparing the responsibilities and behavior of a follower of Christ to a working sheep dog are spot on. Would never have picked this up but so glad our club selected it to discuss.
5,Never want to be without this book!,"I keep buying this book and giving them away. The last one went to Thailand! The subtitle says ""A True Story of Transforming Love"" How true!Lass was transformed through Loving Obedience to her master.... AND I believe that is how you and I are to be transformed. Please read this book and see how your heart will yearn to be like Lass in the realm of obedience. It's just your heart responding to the heart of God... and THAT is obedience. And THAT is an intimate relationship with the Father...."
2,Poor quality,The first time that I used this pan the non-stick surface came off where the rack sits on the pan. Subsequent usage and washings have resulted in more and more of the non-stick surface wearing off. Definitely not worth the $$.
3,Not the best of the series.,"It was ok, and I am looking forward to reading the next book. I am anxious to find out how the new Cochran ""brother is received."
5,A Merry Little Christmas,"A very good book, keeps your interest and you don't want to put the book down, I cannot wait to read the next one."
4,"Great, But...","I really enjoyed A Merry Little Christmas although I expected more sparks to fly between Donnie and Angel. Ms. Schuster has been preparing us for this union since Lucky in Love and I believed that they were going to have some hot and lusty scenes. I have read every one of her books involving the Cochran/Deveraux families. I can't wait to read the next one. Hopefully, we will finally find out about John."
2,"Hahira, GA 31632","I'm surprised that this book was not better written. It's hard to believe that this was Angel's story. Ms. Schuster other books dealing with this family have been great. Just a little disappointed. I still will support her works, but I hope the next story would at least make sense. She had so many other stories going it took away from the main two characters. Just my opinion.."
4,Bad light bulbs,"My daughter received the toy for Christmas, and used it 2 (yes 2) times before the light bulb blew out. I understand why it blew after reading the other reviews. Rather than exchange for another, we will return the toy for our money, and buy something that has compatible parts, like batteries that are compatible with the lightbulbs. You would think the experts would be able to design these toys to work and be durable."
2,Poorly Made,"My daugher received this for her 6th birthday back in March. When the batteries died it was put in the closet: out of sight out of mind. When my daughter found it again we put fresh batteries and well, what a shock! All the metal bits in the battery compartment were rusted, corroded etc.! No go with fresh batteries and my husband even tried to redo the wiring. So in the end we rigged a little Maglite into the light area. This toy is a good idea but in my experience it is poorly made and a waste of money."
4,Disappointed,"My 5 year old received this as a birthday gift. It looked like a great idea, until you realize it's a [amt]piece of plastic.For this amount of money, it should come with markers and an eraser.Now, my son can't use his new birthday present until I can get to the store and buy them. Also, in the instructions, it doesn't even tell you what to use to draw with. Do you use crayons, markers, what?I feel this toy is a big disappointment, and is made very cheaply as well.It's a good idea, but needs much improvement."
2,What is with the bulb?,"I purchased this for my son, he saw it on TV and HAD to have it. It looked fun so I bought it...after about 10 minutes the light went out! I know it's not the bulb or the batteries...it's the connection inside where the bulb sits...I messed around with it and got it to work...for about another 10 minutes...DON'T waste your money on this one folks!When you think Crayola...don't always think quality. Very disspointed with this purchase."
2,A Big Disappointment,"My son, who loves to draw, received this toy for his 6th birthday. What a disappointment. It was difficult to assemble and so flimsy. The projector part is too heavy for the plastic base and tips over and the base becomes detatched from the projecter over and over again. You can actually see the the wires hanging out! You can't adjust the projecter to get the picture exactly where you want it -- the arm just doesn't bend. The discs are very hard to remove. This toy is a total piece of junk. I think he used it once. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Should have ran for it......,"I had a bad feeling about this ""toy"" when I saw it-but my kids were BEGGING me for it so profusely(because of those cheezy tv ads)-how could I refuse. I broke down and bought it......and then it broke down. Aside from the fact that the tracer light needs to be adjusted constantly because it gets out of focus- the light bulb is a battery vampire-it is soooo cheaply made-the light head needs constant tightening because it keeps dropping down while in use. STAY AWAY FROM THIS THING NO MATTER WHAT SWEET PUPPY EYES YOUR KIDS MAKE AT YOU-they will thank you later, and you will do much of the same."
1,Useless when light fails on first use...,"The projector bulb lasted less than five minutes on our projector received as a Christmas present.Thus far (in March) neither Crayola or their OEM manufacturer Polyconcept USA has responded to support querries made soon after the failure, though both their websites acknowledge the problem."
3,Need replacement light bulb - anyone know where to get?,"I need to find a replacement light bulb for the projector and have tried all the obvious places with no luck (including the Crayola website, as well). Any suggestions from other owners who have gone down this path before me would be greatly appreciated..."
4,I should have listened to these reviews (m),My 4 year old received this for Christmas. I read the reviews but thought we would try it anyway. The bulb blew within the first 10 minutes she had it. She was so disappointed. We are taking it back to get something else. I hope Crayola is working to improve this product.
4,"Fun Toy, a little flimsy",My daughter enjoyed all of the things she could draw with this. It put together well and was easy to use. Only complaint is that the plastic itself wasn't super durable.
1,Very disappointing,"Like so many others have reported, the bulb blew quickly. Bulb is no longer available and the company says the projector has been discontinued, yet it is offered in the Young Explorers catalog as of 8/12/10. I don't know if Crayola has any credibility left; certainly none with me."
2,Disappointing!,"We bought this Crayola Trace N Draw for Christmas for my 5 year old daughter. She was excited to try it but doesn't like it. The focus is poor -- no clear, crisp pictures to trace, and the projector head moves so easily (despite ""locking"" it in place) that one slight move and your whole picture is out of line. Also, the drawing surface is not sturdily attached. Bottom line -- the idea was a great one but the product is just not well-made."
4,GREAT GIFT,"My 6 year old daughter received this for Christmas (2002). We have yet to have any complications with it. She loves to draw with it, and uses it almost daily. We have hauled it around the countryside with us whenever we go somewhere. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a child that loves to draw or anything associated with art."
2,broke for us too,"Great idea, lasted for a month of use by two 4 year olds, then the bulb broke just like everyone else is talking about on this site. The construction of the toy is very cheap and not durable. I could see that even if the light bulbs would last that the toy itself would eventually break in some other way.A real bummer, because its a great idea, and I am not aware of a comparable replacement."
1,Don't buy it !,"Don't waste your time and money buying this piece of junk. Just as everyone else, the light bulb went out after being on for 5 minutes. After 3 weeks of waiting for the bulb replacements, they new bulbs lasted approximately 15 minutes each. We are now still waiting for new bulbs."
3,Bad bulbs,My daughter recieved this as a Christmas gift. The bulb lasted about two days and blew. I have not replaced the bulb yet. I was very disappointed with the product. I will contact Crayola for a replacement bulb.
3,Please don't buy this toy...,...unless you want a frustrated child. Our light bulb burned out almost instantly. My 5 year old son loves to draw and has been very disappointed. It's a shame since I paid $25.00 for it at Christmas.
1,I would not recommend this product...,"My son received this as a gift for his 3rd birthday. The product is rated 3 yrs+, but really requires an adult to assist with placing the paper, setting up the light and turning the disks once inserted. The light bulb is not bright enough and no matter how much we refocus the lamp, it nevers displays a clear picture for tracing - the lines are always blurred or doubled. Don't waste you money on this product, Crayola needs to go back to the drawing board on this one."
2,A good idea....BUT needs to be improved on,"This is a great concept and only wish it was better designed. The children love the different objects to choose from. They enjoy seeing the picture being enlarged on paper. BUT the problem is when the light shines on the paper...when they try to trace over it. It blocks the image on the paper and they can't see where to trace. They don't use it that much due to this ""light obstruction"". If it wasn't for that problem, I wouldn't hesiate to say they would use it for hours as the girls love to draw. It would help too, if it was better designed i.e. easier to fold or store. Also the blue top on the lamp keeps falling off. The side drawers for the mini disks are a great idea and I would keep that design aspect. I sure hope they come out with an updated model as I definitely would buy it."
1,So disappointing,"My son was thrilled with this toy for the first 30 minutes--then the bulb blew (just like everyone else is reporting). We put in the replacement bulb from the box; again, it lasted 30 minutes and blew again. SO disappointing!! I can't recommend this."
4,A big disappointment,"My four year old got this for Christmas, and loved it....for the whole 2 days it worked. Really disappointed in it."
1,A Piece of Junk,"I purchased 3 of these projectors. The idea is neat. However all three blew bulbs within 3 (short uses). The first one blew a bulb when I was assembling it. The other two took 3 times of using it. I have looked EVERYWHERE for replacement bulbs, from electrical supply stores, automotive stores, retail stores, online bulb warehouses. You can not find them. This toy requires 4 C batteries which will contantly blow your bulbs because it is a 4.8V .5 Amp bulb.I would highly recommend you find another toy. Crayola and PolyConcepts were useless when trying to resolve the problem.SAVE YOUR MONEY! Huge dissappointment!"
3,To trace or not to trace.....,This toy falls apart a lot!! Sometimes right in the middle of tracing. The overhead is too heavy for it's self and doesn't have a good support.My kids will use it but it's not their first choice. It can be too much to deal with.
2,Breaks very easily,My four year old got this as a gift. The light was dim and hard to see. We changed the batteries and tried to change the light bulb. It ended up falling apart. Good concept if it were made more durable.
2,Fun but Cheap!,"I bought this toy for my 6 year old son. He is beyond destruction and takes care of his toys. Well, this one lasted about a month before the light burned out, then just didn't work at all anymore. He loved it, and had fun playing with it, but is very disapointed that it is garbage now. Great fun but not for long!"
2,Not impressed with this toy...,"My 4-year old received this toy for her birthday. My husband and I have had to put it together again and again and again, as it comes apart from the base. Not sure if ours is defective or if they are all like that, but definitely not worth the money!"
4,Not Kid Tough,"I purchased this for my 7 year old granddaughter who loves anything to do with art. She played with it approximately 20min. and came to me because it would not work. I assumed it was the bulb, but was unable to replace it. Now I read another review, that investigated and it is the batteries. I think Crayola should be more specific when they write their specs."
2,Disappointed,"I thought I was purchasing a great tracing board for my granddaughter but she only got to use it once. The bulb burnt out. Since it was defective, I returned it to the store. Lucky for me they were out and did not know when they would get more. Then looking at others' reviews, I think I will shop for a similar toy to replace this one with."
1,Hunk of Junk!,"As the people said in the other reviews, the bulb burned out within the first hour of use. When I got the replacement bulbs they burned out right when I turned the projector on. This toy is going right back to the store. Save yourself some aggravation and take a pass on this one."
3,Broke Christmas Morning---I'm sending it back!!!,"I agree the durability stinks!! After just a few hours of working on Christmas morning, the bulb blew. It was then that I got on-line and found all these comments from customers with similar experiences. I don't need this headache! The concept is good, but the people at Crayola need to re-engineer this product. I'd love to see it made with a plug for wall outlets."
2,Not Durable,The light source is the main problem w/this toy. The light quality to project is poor at best and on the learn to draw discs (red ones) - just move anything a millimeter and your artist will be howling because now the entire picture is out of focus and you have to jiggle it back in place to get the same size so you can finish the picture. It's not worth $20 -maybe $8 at best.
2,"A great Concept, but not worth it!","We bought this for my 3 and 5 yr old last year. They only play with it on occasion. We've had no trouble with the bulb, but the the projector doesn't stay up so the picture is never centered correctly on the paper. It also works best in the evening with all the lights off, otherwise you can't see it too well. Needs some work to make this item worth the money!"
2,Disappointed,My seven-year-old daughter found this projector to be rather limited. The images were simplistic and it frustrated her that she could not easily adjust the size of the display.This product is probably fine for a younger child just learning to draw but will be quickly outgrown.
2,Expected more from Crayola...,This is a low quality product with a defective light bulb but I get the feeling that some of the other reviewers think that the child should draw directly on the desktop. They are looking for special markers and erasers to be included. This is made to draw on paper placed over the desktop and attached to the clip at the top.
2,What a waste,I bought the Trace N Draw for my daughter for Christmas. The bulb blew out only minutes of using it. It is impossible to find a replacement. I did take it back and exchanged it for another one. Same thing happened again. My daughter was very upset and thought it was her fault. The drawing board was supposed to be able to be cleaned using dry erase markers. The picture would not wipe off! What a waste of money and of time trying to get it to work. FIND ANOTHER TOY!!!
2,SIMPLY CRAP,"My 4 year old daughter received this yesterday for her birthday. In just under 5 minutes of use the light bulb blew. I was like ""what the ..."" The light itself is not bright so you can barely see the image and the paper would not stay put. She lost interest quickly. I cannot believe how poorly built this is. My only salvation is her birthday is close to Christmas and I can dispose of this thing on December 26 when she is so preoccupied by the new toys. I always check the reviews on Amazon before I buy my toys. Too bad my friend didnt. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP. There is enough plastic in the landfills already."
4,You would think it comes with everything,My 4 year old son received this toy for his birthday last week. We were surprised that it did not come with any markers or an eraser. So you cannot just start using it unless you have them in the house.
4,Hope for Socialists,"While the fall of the Soviet Union was seen by some as proof that socialism is untenable, Rocker shows in this text how the revolution was doomed from the start, and offers an attractive alternative to the party-led style of statist socialism attempted there. Synidcalism seems to me to be a slightly more ""realistic"" way in which to achieve socialism, that doesn't depend on the benevolence of a centralized authority. Rocker also relates some of the history of the labor movement in general in Europe, and of syndicalism in particular. I would like to have seen a bit more detail regarding syndicalist government structure and economics, the practical aspects, but he gives a very good overview of the movement in not many pages."
5,Great Book!,"This book is sooooo easy to use. It is also great to carry around with you. I am twelve and was worried that I wouldn't be able to make these little animals, but it turns out that they are much easier then they look. This book is a must have!"
4,A solid political documentary,"""Rush to War"" is a very good political documentary. It examines American foreign policy after 9/11. The title is a little misleading, however. The film deals less with the lead-up to the Iraq War than with the foreign policy blunders the Bush Administration made after 9/11. Although the film is a little one-sided (liberal), it still brings up good points and sheds some light on the inner workings of our government."
5,PowerPhrases! is a Winner,"Wow! I loved this book. I recommend this book to anyone needing to communicate more effectively (and don't we all need that). PowerPhrases! is packed with powerful ways to communicate effectively. Meryl Runion has captured the essence of honest, respectful communication. Her book is full of ideas on how to say just the right thing in tough situations. Need to manage your boss? Need to resolve a conflict but save - and even enhance - the relationship? Need to negotiate for what you want? I found all of this and more inside this book. It is easy to read, clear and full of real life examples. Thank you! This is just what I needed. I have already recommended this book to several people from Customer Service Representatives through Vice Presidents."
4,surrealistic jello,"if you have reached this page you are familiar withmost of these selections. makes me go back to thefirst album, way ahead of its time . i have all but threesongs on different cd's but purchased this anyway. i findthe sequence interesting and its hard too find a liveversion of 'have you seen the saucers'its quite a bargain at over 70 minutes of mindexpanding san francisco music."
3,Good introduction to JA for the uninitiated,"Good introduction to the Airplane for the uninitiated. However, the best compilation I have come across - by far - is a vinyl double-album called Flight Log. Unfortunately it does not seem to be available on CD. If anyone knows anything to the contrary, please drop me a line!"
2,Summery of my review on Brain Fever - it was OK,"In my opinion, this book was barely mediocare. While the premise was fairly interesting, the book itself used many cliches and was very predictable when it wasn't being as clear as mud. It wasn't a bad book, and it wasn't a book I would say to someone ""never read this book!"" but I wouldn't recommend it. If someone was to ask me ""please comment on this book"" my reply would be something like ""unremarkable""."
4,"Excellent tv movie, but.......","could have had a better finale. Such as a positive ending, like finding others and banding together and forming a brand new society looking for a chance to right the wrongs of the past.Non the less, in my opinion, I thought this story is a great example of survival after a holocaust. The science of solar flares was spot on. Also, it shows that it is possible to have hope of survival.Not a great movie, but a decent story and performance from the cast, like Noble Willingham (Walker, Texas Ranger) and Kathleen Quinlan. For fans of Peter Graves (RIP), this is a treat. Another under-rated movie with PG is Five Man Army.Another thought, at the inflated used price of: $84.95, from the lone seller of this VHS movie, fat_frog_books, I think a person can do better by searching the internet, or even Amazon.Just a thought."
4,"A good book, but too many errors to serve as an introduction","This book serves as a very good way to begin to understand the colonial realtionship that has existed (and continues to exist) between Puerto Rico and the US. The only real weakness in the book (at least in the paperback version) is the incredible number of typograhic errors throughout the text. Since I knew much of the material that the book was talking about already, I just corrected the errors in my head, but someone who doesn't can come away quite confused."
5,Warm-hearted Stories,Poignant stories of Mexican-American people. Told in an easily readable style. Each story gives pause to reflect. Highly recommended.
4,a quick & humble impression,"I got to take a look at this book in the UMASS non-circulating collection. It was beautiful, covered with a gold patterned cloth. Inside, the paper and reproductions of the carpets and art work were of the very best quality. I read the introduction and skimmed through the subsequent chapters. After my breif encounter with this book, I felt as though I had found the secret heart of Alexander's architectural theories. Somehow his passion for these carpets seemed to be the kernal from which his volumes have sprung."
2,One out of four is not good.,"Back Cover description: IN LOVE WITH THE ENEMY. Only a few weeks till Christmas and I'm in danger of losing the job I love and the only family I've ever really known-all thanks to devastatingly gorgeous Marcus Grey. Sure, Marcus has his reasons for wanting to take over the company, but I'm determined to do anything to stop him, even if that means spending time with him...alone, out of the office. After all, it's for the good of Colette, Inc. So what if I wind up losing something even more important...like my heart?This wasn't the worst in the 20 AMBER COURT series, but only one of them was worth reading and this wasn't one of them. Read THE BACHELORETTE by Kate Little instead."
1,worst toy,"this toy is the worst toy i have ever laid my toy-loving eyes upon. i expected to be puzzled by this puzzling new board game adventure, but instead was left throwing the horribly boring puzzle pieces around the room in a fit of rage."
5,An excellent overview of child fire-setting,"Dr. Gaynor is one of a handful of true experts on juvenile fire-setting in the United States. She and her colleagues are doing great service by turning out books such as this one, which help us understand and do therapy with juvenile fire-setters. This book was hard to find, but worth the wait."
5,See the anime that changed the history of anime,"This is the second installment to the first Gundam trilogy. The movie is edited version of a TV show that is 20 years old, but the depth of the story and the characters far exceeds some of anime or even sci-fi movies today. This is the anime that changed the history of anime. This is the must see not only for anime fans, but those who thinks anime is for kids."
5,GOOD Quality!,"I was skeptical with the price as to the quality of this item. But I can say that it is very high quality and just as nice as the ones that cost 2x or more at Baby's R Us and other stores, and most of them do not come with the ottoman. Nice wood, comfortable cushions. The only con is that the arm cushions tend to spin a bit. But for $2 I bought some Velcro and that fixed that problem real easily.I would highly recommend to anyone."
3,okay chair,"The chair itself is fine -- I love the gliding motion. The fabric is kinda cheap -- the seat gets permanent folds in it from sitting. The arm pads do not stay in place, they roll off to the side."
2,Not real impressed!,"We received the glider in great condition and well packaged. However, my husband had to drill longer holes in the arms to get the long screws to go in. Once the chair was together, it's nice looking but not as comfortable as what it looked in the picture. I wanted a chair to put in my own little corner for reading by the fireplace. I'm not sure I'll spend a whole lot of time in it as it's not all that comfortable. The ottoman could be made a little higher. Just not what I expected, but got with a free gift card when I bought my new car, so not a total loss. Just shop around. I definitely wouldn't recommend a glider any cheaper than this one if that determines comfort."
4,Great Chair!,"This is a wonderful chair for the price. It was so easy to put together. I did it myself at 5 months pregnant. It is a smooth glider, does not make noise and the picture does not do it justice. It is very pretty. The only con I have to give it is that the cushions are not as soft as I had hoped.They are kind of firm but good for a sore back:) Fantastic chair. I am really happy with this buy:)"
2,Underwhelmed,"I needed a multi-function device for my small business. After some research, I settled on Ricoh based on some of the reviews here and else where. The setup as a stand-alone system was easy and it took less than 20 minutes. It does all the things as advertised, however, there are some not discussed anywhere:1. It weighs about 70 lbs. In other words, it's very heavy.2. It consumes a lot of power. When this is on, my lights flicker!3. It makes too much noise...it makes clunky noises when powering up and when it prints.4. Color is not as vivid as others, such as Samsung's CLX-3160FN5. For some reason, when I'm printing labels, the it creates smudges and the image is not complete on the bottom. The same image on the same labels in Samsung comes out fine.All other function works, but this Ricoh model just doesn't impress me at all."
1,Dream Machine Nightmare,"The concept behind this machine is great. They have put in all you need to run a small office. It is quite simple to use, the program is good once it is installed properly and overall it works well. You will love it for the first month (thought the color print is never very good). Then reality sinks in. The short lived consumables are the most expensive I have seen for any machine this size running between $150-200 per cartridge, there are 4 cartridges. If your black cartridge is full and any one of the color ones runs dry the entire machine stops printing! No faxes, no black prints, no black copies.Exactly one week out of warantee ours broke down and required a $350 repair. Since then, besides consumables it has cost us another $700 in repairs and now sits dead, 1 1/2 years after purchase. I refuse to spend any more on this product. I advise you do not buy this as it will certainly run your small business into the ground."
2,It's a pretty good printer...,It's a pretty good printer if you can afford to keep it filled with toner. Each toner cartridge cost between $80 and $100 each time you change one out. It has four colors and black. It will not work at all if one of the colors is out. With that being said...it does print fast and with high quality.
2,Spotty,"OK, I know this is a classic. But it's quality, as far as entertainment, is uneven. Some sections, early on, are compelling, entertaining and educational. But much of it drags on--far too much detail for the insight actually provided. If I were back in college and had this on my assignment list, this is one of the few works I would search Cliff Notes to cover. Sorry."
3,Bent cover,The book arrived in good time but the cover was bent in half. The rest of the book was fine.
2,Might be fine if i could read it,"Type is way too small for my tired old eyes, hence the low rating. You can't rate highly that which you can't read. From snippets I was able to read it looks like a fabulous rendition of the story of the Roman Empire."
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping to find some insights regarding the threats to western or modern civilization today. I learned that powerful leaders are irrational, short-sighted and self-interested. I learned that religious organizations and leaders are the same as political and military leaders. I didn't learn much about why Roman institutions worked or didn't work. This is a long and long-winded work, not worth even half the time of reading it."
4,Great War Stories,"This book was an excellent companion for a tour of Western Europe. It contains a wealth of stories about many of the places one can visit.Keep in mind that this book was written in 1776 and uses ""old English"" grammar. That is, he uses words you wouldn't normally hear today, and uses at least 6 commas per sentence.I found an atlas of world history helpful to understanding the geographical locations of events. The one I used was ""The Anchor Atlas of World History Vol 1"".Gibbon's explanation of Christianity is somewhat tiring and overly detailed. While his exploration of the Barbarians is surprising favorable, it is too brief.Read this book and you will have a good understanding of Roman life, war, and decline."
1,bad edition,This edition is unreadable. Multi-page long footnotes written by the editor interrupt the actual text and it is nearly impossible to tell where they end and Gibbon's text resumes. DO NOT buy this edition unless you are mostly interested in reading these footnotes and not Gibbon.
1,Unreadable,"The gratuitously effusive praise for Gibbon's style in other reviews is hardly misplaced. Unfortunately, you can't actually read Gibbon in this version because the text is constantly interrupted by the annotations of an ignorant and pompous reverend. Cut out the cruft and let Gibbon speak for himself!"
1,Microscopic print,"Note that this paperback, abridged edition is 700+ pages of print that is so tiny, it takes a magnifying glass to read it, while the abundant footnotes and subheadings require a microscope to read them, not I think, what Gibbons would have imagined. I certainly didn't."
2,TOC still broken,"The TOC is still broken, or perhaps they fixed it for a while and then it broke again. In either case, I bought this book yesterday (March 2 2009) and the TOC is definitely disabled. Given the size of the book, a functional TOC would be very nice.I emailed customer support, they verified the TOC was broken, and offered a refund."
3,Better,"The price is right, but I found the text more or less unreadable. Am now trying the $9.99 version (in sample), will see if one gets what one pays for.The above was written before the published juploaded a new version. The type face is MUCH better (or I am in a better mood). It still looks too muchlike a ms., with lots of spaces between some words (problems of a fixed width font) and footnotes placed in the text. But the new version is clearly readable.For my taste I will go with the $9.99 version (I am going to spend quite a while with Gibbon), but this version surely now is very good value."
3,Tough,"An extraordinary 'opus' - but it does require patience and some knowledge of latin. It gets more and more interesting as it progresses through the third volume, as 'modern' Europe is beginning to form."
2,Not a light read.,"I had heard of the series, and was looking for a smaller condensed version. The goal was to compare those events to current events today, or at least refute some of what is being said. Not even close. This book requires a doctorate in ancient history just to get through the introduction. A fine book, I'm sure, but not for the casual reader."
3,A Massive Tome that is Exceptionally Well Written,"OK, I admit that I am only about 2% into this 6 volume survey of late Roman History. I generally like Kindle editions, but this document suffers from the footnotes being dispersed within the main body of the text. I often have difficulty in discerning whether I am in the text or a footnote. However, even with this issue, it is hard to beat for the price.Gibbon is a genius that works well at weaving together a number of sources of information to generate a story that flows well. I will likely continue on reading this work, but I honestly have no clue if I will ever read all of it. If just reading all of it seems like a monumental task, then it is difficult to imagine how long this took to write down in longhand back in the 1700s. All roads in history and engineering lead back to Rome. This is a great place to better understand the foundations of our physical and political western societies."
5,Less is More,"This album is quintessential blues, mexican style. With only a few instruments to accompany their voices, Marcelo and Aurelia prove that sometimes less is more. You can't listen to this album without being moved. The great thing about this album is that it makes you feel more than the mixed emotions that come with a broken heart. This album makes you cry for the same reasons that those melancholy Pedro Infante movies make all mexicans cry. This is a beautiful album!"
3,So-So,"In all her books, Catherine Ponder always makes a reference to another book of hers... as if she is trying to sell more of her books... she could have said what she did in less words and we could have bought a less expensive book. I did find some new things but i haven't tried them yet."
5,A Life Changing Book,"My sister sent me this book as a gift. I was newly remarried and having a very difficult time adjusting to a new husband, new surroundings, not to mention my husband adjusting to living with me and my daughter. I purchased a sprial notebook and wrote down every prayer listed in the book. As I drove my daughter to school every day I repeated all the prayers. It took about 6 months before my life started changing. So much good came to me and my husband at that time. It's 3 years later and it's getting better all the time. I don't believe my marriage had a chance until Ms. Ponders book and her directions for living entered my life. I bless you and praise you for your wonderful advise. I have passed on her prayers to many people. I have said prayers for people who I see hurting and I can see results immediately. I feel loved like never before. I know God like never before. God bless you for your works, it was just what I needed."
4,A must read,"Excellent reading!!! Mr. Holmes writes from the heart and allows his readers to feel his every emotion. This book was easy to read, very informative, held my interest and left me yearning for more.I finished the book with a better understanding of those who are different as well as those who struggle with their difference."
5,One fine book,"If you are a fan of Picasso and his artist buddies and going to Paris, this is a fine book. Check out other titles from the same publisher, ""The Little Bookroom,"" as well if going to Paris. They are equally fine. I own a number of them as well. They are all unique and in depth."
5,Great tape,I used this tape to secure a screen to an outdoor brick wall and it works perfect in all weather. Nuff said
3,Not nearly as sticky as Gorilla Tape,"I have to put duct tape down in the corners of the basement each year at this time to catch the inevitable cricket invasion. Cheap cheap cheap they say, all day and night. I'm not cheap!At first I tried this ""nuclear"" tape, but the crickets just laughed and waltzed all over it. I think they had running races up and down the nuclear tape, giggling all the way.So I got regular Gorilla tape, put it down, and have already caught a bunch of them. They jump on and don't jump off. If you want Supertape that sticks, don't buy this, buy Gorilla tape."
3,"Interesting and informative, but book design is annoying","Anyone interested in the history of roadside signs will learn much from this book, but what a chore it is to read it. The main text is in bright red type with minimal margins. Captions and diagrams are in black type (thankfully) but far too small to be read easily. In many diagrams the type is not only tiny but is also in all-caps, which might not be a problem if the diagrams weren't so wordy. Some of the photos are so small that we just have to assume that they illustrate the author's points.I recommend the book because of its content, but be sure to get a good reading light and a magnifying glass to get the full benefit."
4,Signs of the times...,"This book illustrates, with some technical form, the artful, whimsical commercial signage of days past. If you're wistful or nostalgic about the wild neon and bright painted signage you saw or like from the golden ages of the fifties and sixties, this book is for you! It's chock full of signage, specs and discussions of the form and substance of fanciful advertising. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the imagery found all along the Mother Road..and beyond!"
5,One perfect little movie by the great Frank Capra,"Ok. This is my first review. I had virtually no idea what this movie was about,basically never heard of it. But was familar with Capra's work. This movieis a hell of little gem. Will actually buy some for friends. Talk about strong endings ! Please put out more classic black and whites on Blu-ray. Many thanks. It was beautiful. Dr. Michael Hauth"
3,Ancient translation,"While Le Roman Comique is a neglected masterpiece of Western literature, this translation, dating from 1700, is clunky and archaic- much more so than the French original from 1651. For the only existing modern translation see [...] or the Kindle store:The Comic Romance"
4,Good faucet,Looks really good. Mine did not have the white faucets but I did not need them. Very easy to insttall
4,A Fine New Sound,"The tunes here are clever and catchy. ""Ants Marching"" is the one that stands apart the most. The ideas and melodies are fine. Trouble is, Dave and the rest of the band have a hard time of what you could call laying the hammer down. Take a listen to Jimmy Page and John Bonham as to how that is done, Dave. You don't lack it altogether, but it still can be better."
3,Almost good...,"I had pretty high hopes for this bleeder... unfortunately I used it once and have since reverted to only using it in the initial stages of the brake bleeding. After I swapped out my lines, the vac made the job of pulling fluid back into the lines and the calipers pretty easy. However, after that, it's pretty useless. It NEVER gets a good seal around the bleeder nipple, thus letting air come in from around the edges. That makes it look like you still have air coming out of the lines, even when you don't."
5,Great little product,"This product will allow you to bleed your brakes on your own! It's pretty well made, the only part that I could see braking would be the handle that you pump."
1,Ought to call it Miti Leaky,"I bought this thinking that I could change my brake fluid without having to bother my wife to pump the brake for me. It worked well for sucking the fluid out of the reservoir, but it was all downhill after that. The cap to the collection cup leaks like a sieve. I had to keep pumping and pumping to maintain any sort of suction. I tried a couple things to seal it up, but to little avail. After spending a good half an hour fiddling on the first one and a half wheels, I broke down and called my wife to pump the brake pedal. Ended up being much quicker. Oh, well."
4,A good find!,"This is my first encounter with Youssou N'Dour, but from the first song I knew I'd found something good. The music is uplifting, playful, and beautiful. The singing is pleasant, easy on the ear.The multiple instruments makes for a rich performance. It's almost like a mix of African and Mediterranean sounds -- a mix I like well.There are only 8 songs, but they run 4-5 minutes, so it's not too short, and it's the type of music you could play over and over again.The songs I enjoy most: Shukran Bamba, Bamba The Poet, Touba - Daru SalaamShould you like World music at all, or the style of the 'Pure Moods' series, I think you will enjoy this CD."
4,N'Dour's homage to Egypt and the heartland of Sufism.,"N'Dour's latest release EGYPT is different yet again: EGYPT retains N'Dour's homage to Egypt and the heartland of Sufism, blends in his Senegal sound with Middle East influences, and showcases these influences more than many of his other albums."
2,Listen in Moderation,"I did like this album when i bought it. Infact I would have definetly given it a higher rating then - but now, after listening to it a few times, I realize the album really begins to weigh too much on you and the songs grow stale. They are great songs, and they should be appreciated, but really listen to it in moderation."
4,"Great voice, Great music","B.B. has always been one of my favorite singers, he pours his heart and soul into singing. This is great old time gospel music, and B.B. nails the singing. THe whole album sounds like he took his Blues band and brought in a few female choir singers to back him up. The only thing is I dont think he plays guitar at all on the album. They have a guy really killing it on the organ. Got to love the old Hammonds."
5,Keeps you on your toes!,"This tale has many plots and is rich with mystery, geography, colorfullandscape and history. The characters are as colorful as the landscape,the suspense right there and our heroine will take youfor a great ride! Thank you, B. J. Oliphant!"
3,Great series but not worth the amount people are asking.,"One of the greatest anime series ever created in my opinion. The last 4 episodes of the R season [my personal favorite]. This is the only dvd I'm missing in my collection but as much as I love the series I refuse to pay ridiculous money sellers have been asking when originally you could buy the dvd for no more than $20. True they are no longer releasing the dvd and this could be considered a ""collectable"" but the point is very few people are going to want to pay this much for a dvd that people could just copy off of someone else with today's technology."
4,Looooooooooooove It !!!,I love this one and it's my favorite season (beside s)Rini finds out how much she is loved and sailor moon uses the crystal to try to stop the Doom Phantom
3,next time buy the dvd,"Okay, i'm usually a big fan of SM, but this one is supposed to be really good, and i thought it was, but DIC cut out sooooooo much stuff the story barely made sense. I now have learned my lesson to buy allllll anime on DVD."
3,An okay dub,"Are you people insane?Yes,the voices in the Dic dubbed version might be better,but their dubbing stinks.You have know clue how many useless cuts they make to series and even to the episodes on this tape!If you people rreally want to see sailormoon,I recommend starting with the S Movie,the Japanese uncut version.It has the same cover!"
3,A question about sailor moon volume 14!,"I actually havent seen the dvd yet and I had a question. Everyone says this dvd is the conclusion but I wanted to know if all the finally sailor members come like sailor pluto,saturn,uranus,and neptune. Are they in the last dvd?"
3,Wise Man is a Video Game Character??,"in R, Wise Man is Character who hate all the Humans, he Evil and Powerfuil he is one of Moon Family he is not Tratior, but there are he is one evil Villains in Final Battle, but Square of Video Game; Final Fantary, Wise Man is Character like Black Mage, Black Mage is Wise Man, the are Twin Brother, will Wise Man is look like Black Mage becuase he have no face, but even Black Mage have no Face any Eye, will Black Mage, and Wise are the same."
3,Its Alright.,"Im a Radio fan, i really would like to havs ,The People Next Door,Hot Stuff,and Still In the Groove these grooves alone would make it 5 stars."
2,A Complete Waste of Time,"This is a lackluster novelization of the movies ""American Graffiti"" and ""More American Graffiti."" I don't think it was published in the US-- only in Britain.The hours you might spend reading this thing-- a line-by-line transcription of the films with some visual cues thrown in-- would be far better served by watching the brilliant ""American Grafitti."" The book serves no purpose and has no value in itself. Skip it."
5,Fabulous little book,"This is a very useful little book. We bought this because we live in Seattle and recently bought a bird feeder that's now being visited by all kinds of birds. The book is really helpful - it starts with a few pages of info about how to attract birds to your garden and then the rest of the book has colour pictures of birds on the right-hand side page and writing about them on the left. The birds are organized by type, but also by colour which makes them pretty easy to identify. I think this is a great book for beginners like me who just want to know roughly who's feeding in their garden!"
3,Interesting Alternative Guide to Dietary Remedies,"This book has and the dietary program offered here has been of interest to folks with IBS and IBD. Dr. Peikin presents a self-help program which is a high-fiber, low-fat, balanced diet that helps your digestive tract. People with IBS will like it, but those with IBD may find the high-fiber difficult to stomach, so to speak. If you are looking for alternative dietary remedies, you might see if this works for you."
3,Why intestinal blocks?,"I have contracted four blockages of the small intestine over the past ten years, one requiring surgery. No specialist has been found that can offer a cause or suggestive preventive measures. Very frustrating. Dr. Peikin addresses just about every intestinal disorder except blockages. I was dissapointed."
2,Not very useful information,"I purchased ""The Wonder of Probiotics"" at the same time as this book. The Wonder of Probiotics contains plain and simple valuable information on how to use probiotics to improve your health. I found this book very boring and not containing useful information on how to incorporate probiotics into your life. Don't waste your money."
2,Price is right Fun,"I wanted to make sure someone else did not buy one of these with out knowing how they worked.1. With camera inside looking out window, washed out picture of outside world.2. How to fill in license so s/w will run. First 8 digits model # - second 12 digits mac number on bottom of server without the -s . I found this on one instruction and not on the other. Hope this saves someone the hour I wasted.3. Picture is best in a room, and you must use the focus on camera.4. Just as hard to setup as the other ip video servers I have like the 9100a.5. If you want to play with a ip camera this is a cheap way to learn.6. Nice to put in a room, it is so small, camera size of small cell phone.7. Lots of noise on the video, grainy , Night operation in a room, NOT without an external light.8. You can really only run it at 176x144, 160x120 .Hope this helps.Frank"
2,Interesting book-bad ending,I thought this was a pretty original plot. But the ending was so flat and unbelievable. As another reviewer pointed out - the endings of each chapter with a premonition got old really fast.
2,Flawed From the Start,"When I started reading ""To Bury the Dead"" I was looking for your typical thriller. The back cover describes the book as one man's search for anwsers. What the book turned out to be was a deep dive into obsession and control.The story is about Paul Kelly a fireman in a New Jersey town. After a rough start in life Paul has turned it around. He has a loving family, good friends and a solid job. Paul also purchased a second house as fixer-upper. The on night Paul's life is changed when his daughter is murdered by a local teenager. This is were the book turned dramatically. Paul becomes obsessed with ""why this happened to me"" and starts taking serious risks to get the anwsers.By the end of this book, the reader will be shaking his head in complete amazement that Craig Spector has gone this far. The obsession is blown way out of proportion and the ending is very unbelievable. This one might want to stay off your must read list."
4,Spector's Solo,"I loved the books that Craig Spector wrote with his previous partner, but had only read one short story that he had written alone prior to this book. His previous books were a roller coaster ride of horror. This one had the same intensity and depth without the gore. He has proved here that he is as good a writer on his own as he was paired with Skipp. The characters were strong and well-delineated. The attachments to the other fire fighters and the interaction with his wife were all extremely realistic. The only problem I had was believing a guy as straight as Paul seemed to be could carry out the revenge as he did. I did expect it to be scarier, but that's wishful thinking, I guess. After all Craig was a zombie in ""Night of the Living Dead""."
4,Longer Version of album is great... 4.5 stars!,"...however, there isn't enough jamming on this album. The second set of the show has all of the jamming, which is basically the entire second disc. I'm glad the second part of the show was finally released, it really adds to the show, and enhances the listening experience. My only gripe with this show, or this album, is that the song on the first disc aren't jammed long enough. I mean seriously, a Franklin's Tower under 6 minutes, and a Fire On The Mountain clocking in at just under 7 minutes? Thats a disappointment. But! If you have other live albums like the Dick's Picks sets with longer jams, I'd highly recommend this album. The songs are all well performed musically and vocally. My favorite tune off this one is Row Jimmy. Just excellent! Enjoy!"
2,"Dick's Picks #3 is similar, and better","First of all, I wasn't there.I was disappointed by this set.The music is lifeless and driven by a plodding disco-ish beat.I much prefer the 1972-era material which is almost uniformly on fire.Many of the songs on this CD are performed in a much more lively manner on Dick's Picks #3, from 1977. In particular, compare the two versions of ""Samson"" and ""Franklin's Tower"". The Dead Set versions sound like the kind of songs a has-been band pays on a summer cash in tour, while the DP3 versions boil over with drive and energy. In particular the DP3 ""Franklin's Tower"" is a shimmering, grooving all too short 15 minutes long, while the Dead Set version sounds forced just to make it to eight minutes.Still looking and listening!"
2,Does LG stand for Lesbian and Gay?,"The book tells you where to find gay bars in every major city (and many minor ones too, like Boise, Idaho). It also lists gay newspapers and support groups. I has an essay written by a gay activist who opposes gay marriage on the grounds it could make gays too conservative when their goal should be to make heteros more promiscuous. What this has to do with traveling the USA I'm still trying to figure out. It tells the gay traveller where the best pick up joints are, but doesn't do so for heteros. All in all, this book is great is you are a gay swinger who wants to travel from town to town visiting all the major gay nightclubs. For the rest of us, I don't recommend it. They call themselves LG for Let's Go, but maybe it really stands for Lesbian and Gay?"
1,this sucked!,"anyone who thinks this was a good video is selling it. it was terrible acting and the information was worthless. it would have been a little funny if i was totally hammered, but it was just unbearable. i already wrote this review once and someone had it removed, boo! read my other reviews to evaluate my sincerity."
4,Good,"The book was practically brand new, just some normal wear and tear on the hardback cover. No writing or highlighting either. Overall, good product."
5,Fun for ALL Ages,"Our 7-year-old gave this to a pal for a birthday gift and loved it so much it was the ONLY thing she asked Santa for this Christmas! It kept us all busy on Christmas Day -- we even played with a 5-year-old (albeit a bit more slowly). Quick to learn and very addictive, teaches kids about the concept of the food chain...they'll beat the adults on the ""Feeding Frenzies"" many times because of their quicker reflexes! LOTS of fun, and portable so you can pack it and play it in motel rooms or tents when you're traveling (not practical to play in the back of a moving vehicle, however -- the kids were so hooked, they did try!)!!!"
2,Not a favorite...,"Basically, this is the game of War with a few minor twists. My four-year-old likes it but rarely chooses it; my 6-year-old is bored silly in about 5 minutes. The order of the food chain can be memorized by even a small child in about 5 minutes, and after that it is a bit mind-numbing. Rat-a-tat-cat and Sleeping Queens are MUCH more interesting and can hold our attention for game after game."
2,Fun But Not Great,I thought this would be more educational but it is really just a different take on the card game War that I played as a kid. My 5 and 7 year old enjoy it but we've only had it for a week and I see them getting bored with it quickly.Wouldn't buy it again.
3,All Chomp and No Bite,"I agree with the previous ""it's-just-O.K."" reviewers that this game is a glorified version of war. Directions are printed up slightly awkwardly and slightly confusingly- to this day, I am not sure if I actually reading them correctly, and thus missing something instrumental to this game that would make it fabulous. Sometimes it's over much too quickly; other times it seems endless and brain numbing. My daughter and I both get quickly bored when playing this game. The food chain and general sea life education are cool bonuses, but alas, that fact cannot save this game from me- an animal at the apex of the chain with the power to pass this game on to other small fry."
1,Which feeder is for sale here?,"The item in the picture is indeed the Duncraft Squirrel-proof Selective feeder. However, the product description is of a DIFFERENT Duncraft product. If you order this item, which product do you actually receive? There's a significant difference in both size and price between the two, so customers need to be clear on which item is being sold.Note that the ""star"" rating I have assigned to this review does not apply to either product (I have the Accent feeder, which I like - I want to buy the Squirrel-Proof Selective) - just to the confusing presentation here."
4,Excellent reference guide,"Susan Lark has provided a very good source of dietary information to help you control your fibroids. You start to understand the connection and to also understand that your body is just a little too good at some of the things it does for you. Sort of like a cursing and a blessing. You figure if we all still lived in caves you would be in your element because with a healthy blood supply like yours you would have definitely been one of the sought after females for producing offspring. But alas, we live in a different time and we need the info Susan can provide to stay away from doctors and drugs that do more harm than good.I don't follow everything she saids but I follow enough to know that it does make a difference. Even if amazon.com doesn't have a current copy try and find a used one, it is worth it."
1,"If I could, it would be a 0.","This title had bad animation. It had an even worse plot. The basic storyline(oh, wait, this is the WHOLE storyline)involves two psychic sisters--one is feral, the other crippled-- joining together in this ""angel""...who promptly kills as many people as the ""bad guys"". This doesn't contain just a ""touch of ultra-violence"", as the box suggests. I think the animators ran out of colors other than red. Severed arms, severed legs, severed heads, and disemboweled people are just a few of the delicacies to be found in this god-awful anime."
2,A Mess of Storytelling,"The One Good Thing: Action.Some will find this worthwhile. Personally, it did nothing for me, especially since it is yet another mecha anime in an already saturated market. The storytelling is a mess, jumping either moments or years between episodes and throughout there is never one moment worth grasping as good storytelling, only continual, endless, needless, violence.I'd only recommend this for people who enjoy violence and action."
5,A Great Anime Series,"Genocyber is definately one of the best utlra-violent sci-fi/action films out there, and having all the episodes together on one dvd is great! The story revolves around a huge corporation, a psychic, a little girl, and government experimentations. Genocyber is this almost god-like creaure that was somehow formed by two psychic sisters. The plot line is a little hard to follow at times, but the action scenes are top notch. The only draw-back to this series is that it is extremely violent, and more than a bit weird. I enjoyed it, though, and highly recommend getting this dvd."
4,"Good, though violent...","After the Genocyber destroys Tokyo in part one, the project is moved to a battleship. The mysterious girl is taken in by the Ship's doctor. Then the Genocyber runs around destroying things again. All in all, that's about as much of the plot as I could gather. It's rather complicated, and confusing, but the animation's great, and the mecha is pretty unique. If i had to compare it with something, MD Geist is the first thing that pops into my mind. It is much weirder though and extremely violent. I would consider this excessive violence one of its only drawbacks. If you like weird, ultra-violent animes that include a lot of mass destruction- this is a video for you < I think it may be one of the best of it's kind>. If violence is not your thing, stay far away from this title."
1,Replay value = 0,"Let me start by saying that we own many Gamewright games, and love all of them BUT this one, where they really dropped the ball. The game design is very flawed, and, after 30 min of play, you will easily discover that there is a fool-proof method for player #1 to win at all times. Did they even play test this at all???????? Save your money for Round Table or Frog Juice!"
3,Not full scale,The product description implies that this is a full scale replica - it is not. It is a scalled down version. Otherewise it is a very good replica for this type of rifle for the price.
5,GREAT book!,"As always, I can't wait for the next Marie G. Lee book to come out. This one was fun, but touching, and really interesting."
2,Fabuloso?,"This book is about a girl named Jin Ha and she is Korean. She just moved from Korea to Minnesota. Her mother doesn't know much English and avoids Americans. Jin Ha is taking an advanced math class and is flunking it. She tells her parents that she is doing well in math and her mother believes her. Jin Ha then asks her friends, but they do not know what to do.I didn't really like this book because it was very dull and boring in some parts, but some of the parts were okay. The book was slow and not exciting. I would reccomend this book to people who like slow and easy books to read. There is not much of a good plot or excitement to it, but that is just my opinion. Although it is boring and dull there is a great lesson to it."
1,Bugged!,"3 out of 4 movies I have viewed have the (very large) Mill Creek logo appearing onscreen about every 10 minutes. That's enough to earn a big ""thumbs down"" from me."
2,Incomplete Versions,"For those that care, be aware that many of the films in this set aren't complete. The information on the back of the box is incorrect for some titles in this collection. Depending on how desperate you are to see these films this information might be useful.""Crypt of the Living Dead"" is presented here B&W;, even though it is a color film. It looks as if you were watching a B&W; TV print.""The Last Man on Earth"" is not presented widescreen here, and is in a pretty ragged edition.""The Vampire Bat"" is presented here at 59 minutes, several minutes shorter than its usual running time (the box says 71!).""Werewolf in a Girl's Dormitory"" is missing the entire opening credits sequence.So that's 4 out of 20 films. Oh, and the MILLCREEK logo is present on some films to deter pirating, but who in their right mind would want to pirate ""Mama Dracula"" anyway?"
3,ALPHA DVD VERSION,"I SAW THIS ON TV BACK IN THE 60'S & REMEMBERED IT BEING PRETTY SCARY WITH A COOL VAMPIRE/WEREWOLF/WHATEVER? TRANSFORMATION SCENE...A STRIPPER HAS HER FACE DISFIGURED (IT'S NOT ALL THAT BAD) IN A CAR ACCIDENT & THE ATOMIC VAMPIRE DOCTOR KEEPS HER BEAUTIFUL BY KILLING OTHER WOMEN (IT'S A GLAND THING) INCLUDING HIS ASSISTANT (SHE'S THE HOT ONE OF THE TWO) WHO REALLY LOVES DR. JEKYLL/ MR. ATOMIC VAMPIRE. CRAZY, TRASHY, DEMENTED, SEXY, SLEAZY, FUN !!!THE ALPHA DVD BRINGS THIS RATING DOWN A NOTCH OR TWO. THERE IS A CONSTANT HUMMMMM THROUGHOUT, LOTS OF JUMPS & SPLICES & THE IMAGE ISN'T ALL THAT SHARP AT TIMES. IT SEEMS TO BE MISSING SCENES AS WELL, MAKING VIEWING THIS NEAT LITTLE SCHLOCKER SOMEWHAT CONFUSING...TO ME THIS IS STILL A FONDLY REMEMBERED SLICE OF TV TRASH & I RECOMMENDED IT TO ALL, REGARDLESS..."
2,What Atom age??,"For note: I watch this movie in ""50 movie pack horror classic"", and I'm glad, I didn't buy it solely. Average, I buy this movie less than a dollar.My general review, this movie is ridiculous. What atom age? What you got is wolfman-like creature, who kills woman for her glands. There's no relation between vampire and atom age. the motive's also laughable."
1,pointy b--bs and not much else! (from another site),"Had to see this as I'm a big ""B"" fan, but even for '61 it's clunking and clanky. One star for a couple of leery, pointy b--b scenes but still a wasteland.Blockbuster made me delete that word as ""offensive""... what if ya wanna call somebody a b--b?"
3,Alpha's Atom Age Vampire,"The Alpha Video Copy of Atom Age Vampire is a short version and runs 68.8 min on my DVD player (running time on cover lists 87 min), so the storyline is sometimes a little bit confusing due to some cuts. Picture quality is not very crisp, the audiotrack has a sort of overlay, a tone in the background, not very loud but permanent. For me it's okay for 8 bucks, it's fun to watch, but don't expect a quality better than a rather bad video tape."
2,Very Boring!!!,"Although it has the classic look of the 60's, which I love, this movie is kinda dull and boring. A woman named Jeanette is horribly disfigured. A man tries some tests on her, and fixes her. He realizes he must kill other women to keep Jeanette lookin' sexy! I probably wouldn't recommend ATOM AGE VAMPIRE!!!p.s. I have an awesome aunt named Jeannette!"
1,THIS MOVIE IS GRADE A CRAP,"this is a horrible movie. i beg you not to waste your money on this load of steaming crap. it's boring and just horrible. it is also very sad, because this is lon chaney jr's last movie. i feal bad that such a great actor has this movie as his last on film apperance. ONCE AGAIN THIS MOVIE SUCKS TAKE THE MONEY YOU SPEND ON THIS FILM AND BUY A MOVIE LIKE DEAD-ALIVE,ZOMBIE LAKE OR THE CRAWLING EYE"
1,Thanks for nothing,I waited over a month and never recieved this item before I went on a prolonged vacation. Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!
3,Need to eat,"I have made a few mistakes lately trying to spice up our WFGF meals , this has wheat in it ... it is in the suace , so if that is an issue with you , beware. I really wish they would do a better job with the lable and nutritional information."
4,Great NL for tight spaces,I use this night light in a gfci/switch combo because it does not block the switch. It can also be inserted in either direction because the prongs are not polarized. My only gripe is the life span isn't very long as I only got about a year out of it.
4,Orient Worldtimer,"This is an awesome watch at a fair price. It has a domed sapphire crystal which is an expensive complication. Solid steel back (not exhibition). Solid end-links bracelet with fold-over clasp. The outer bezel (cities) is beneath the crystal and is rotated in either direction by the crown at the 4:00 O'clock position. The inner bezel (1-24 hours) is positioned by the main crown at the 3:00 O'clock position. The 24 hour bezel then tracks in real time to show the hour in the selected city. The day of month dial (1-31) at 6:00 O'clock is adjusted via the main crown. If you are over 40, the text on the DOM dial may be too small to read. For overall legibility, the white dial with black text presents the best contrast. The power reserve indicator is a very handy feature on an auto-wind and shows a max of 40 hours. Overall fit and finish is very good."
3,A little extra at the end of this coloring book,"After you get through the pages of well done line drawings from Near East images, there is a ""doll dress"" that goes along with another book from Bellerophon of ""infamous women"". Once again the text and the illustrations are uncredited so I have to take a star off for that slight. The drawings are in a basic chronological ordering though it lacks a historical context for them."
3,Not as good as Dover,"I was hesitant to spend $5 on a coloring book since I've been spoiled by Dover's cheap prices. And I wish I hadn't. I didn't like this book hardly at all... the drawings are smaller, uglier, and there was at least one with breasts/nipples. I understand it is part of studying the ancient near east, but sorry I didn't want my six, seven, and eight year old boys coloring it. I like the coverage of topics/geography, but there's no real reason to buy this rather than something else."
5,A fascinating book - a must read!,"George and Darril Fosty's groundbreaking book ""Splendid is the Sun"" has raised the bar of the history of hockey to a new level. This is more than just a book about hockey, it is a book about human development and the victory of the human spirit!The book was flawlessly researched by these two Canadian brother authors. Their love of the sport of hockey and their passion for human history and detail are contagious when reading this book. It is a must read for real hockey lovers and for those with an insatiable curiosity about the progress of sports and of civilization!"
4,Eric left the elevator,"Not elevator music here, that's for sure. A fusion effort with an extremely talented band. A fusion's who's who. Chick Corea, Russel Ferrante, Dave Weckl, Vinnie Colaiuta, John Patitucci, Terry Lyne Carrington, Alex Acuna (plus more). The music is vital probably due to the fact that the album was recorded live in the studio. Very emotional music, interesting adventuros compositions. It surely deserves to be listened carefully by the music enthusiast. One of the best and deepest album from Eric. At that time Eric left the elevator to record this album and entered the real music floor."
3,Only for the True Alanis Morissette Fan,An all acoustic performance by Alanis is very good. Her vocals are strong as usual. Many will miss the studio mix of her Jagged Little Pill album.
4,Memories of Mom,"Mom found this book at the library when I was a child and she made a stew she called ""Love Apple Stew"" that we all liked.When I found the recipe it was for Brunswick Stew that the stew she made by that name was totally different and uniformly disliked by us.Still, now I know how to make that lovely recipe and maybe I can have a taste of Mom again.I had been looking, off and on, for this book, and I'm so glad to have it!"
2,A good hair dressing.,"All righty, I'm more then pleased with this product. Works great and smells good, for that I give 5 stars. The reason for only two stars is because when the packaged arrived I was less than amused to find nearly half of the DRESSING spilled into the box! So instead of 5oz of RC hair dressing I have 3oz to work with...oh well.1. If your going to package something that has no secure lid... perhaps you should find an efficient alternative way to pack it rather than some pathetic half-a** bubble wrap.2. Seller.... package your product CORRECTLY.3. Royal Crown Company... rethink your container methods.CS"
4,pomade,"I like the consistency of the product. It isn't waxy like Murrays, which is too thick for me. It's pretty much exactly what I've been looking for to create that ""wet look"". The only slightly negative thing I'd have to say about it is it smells a little perfumey almost like lavender. But for the most part I like the product. I'll most likely get more when Im out."
5,good stuff,Gives the slick look I like. I usually mix with Murrays to give more hold or just the royal crown when there already is pomade build up. Old school classic. Olive oil in RC gives the shine and this washes out a lot easier than other hard pomades. My new favorite!
2,"Not for me, I don't think.","Either I'm not old enough or I'm not English enough to appreciate this item. While it does exactly what it promises to do (hold you hair in the position you've styled it), it does so with an scent that attracts GILFS very much like a geriatric Axe. My wife has forbidden its use and it may end up being gifted to friends."
3,western winter steam,"This was a gift. was received as promised. Thought it would be more of a train excursion instead of just camera views. It's very nicely done, just not what we were hoping for."
5,Great Bargain!,"This is an outstanding HDTV for the price. It is everything I hoped it would be and more. No complaints about the TV at all. Beautiful picture.The only complaint is the shipping. I had a very similar experience to the reviewer above. It was delivered through Eagle also. It took 13 days from the time I ordered. I also had to track it down and when it did finally arrive, it was delivered only to my garage. the shipping order stated:2 man, in house, set up, trash. No such luck.Even with the shipping hassle I would buy it again. You can not come anywhere near an HDTV of this quality for $2,000!"
5,Addition to Brian Woods' review,"I feel like I should add to my previous review because I talked about what a great bargain this TV is andthe price has went up $500. I still love this TV. Everyone who sees it comments on how incredible thepicture is. My Time Warner service technician was out the other day and said that he sees a lot ofHDTV's and is usually not impressed, but this set is IMPESSIVE. Now, when the price was $2,000, I feltlike it was a steal. At $2,500, it is still probably the best HDTV you can buy for the price, but it's hard toget as excited about it as before.Bottom line: I would still buy this for $2,500 but I would spend a little more time looking at thecompetition to make sure it's the best deal. I think it would be. From what I've seen, it's hard to find a 50""DLP for under $2,600 + tax."
2,We're getting somewhere!!,"Let's see... VA means various artists, nuclear blast means artists on their label, but...WHO ARE THEY, and WHAT SONGS DO THEY PERFORM???"
5,My new favorite erotica book!,"I couldn't put this book down, racing from one hot story to another and then going back to reread them all again. Fun, imaginative and exciting, this one's getting a permanent place next to my bed. These girls are kinky, wild and crazy (in the best way)!"
2,If this is five-star lesbian erotica...,"If this is five-star lesbian erotica, I have a new career. Clunky dialogue and imagination-free settings do not make for a titillating experience."
5,Spotted a super author in the table of contents...,...which led me to buy this anthology.I enjoyed Therese Szymanski's story `In The Mood' tremendously and then enjoyed 30 other stories by a terrific list of authors including:Alison TylerTristan TaorminoRachel Kramer BusselDiana CageAmie M. EvansJean RobertsStacy Bias
3,This one's pretty hit-or-miss...,"So I had really high hopes for this compilation, especially due to the involvement of Stacy Bias, girl wonder. However, some of the stories were simply poorly written. Cliches abounded, and I found myself distracted from what would otherwise be a perfectly hot story with an interesting enough plot by the sophomorish writing.Don't get me wrong, there are some really great stories with wonderful writing, and some are truly outstanding. It's worth getting. Just not as totally fabulous as I'd hoped."
4,The Crusaders as they should be!,"This cd is music by The Crusaders as it should be. As a long time Joe Sample and Crusaders fans, it was good for me to enjoy what I would consider to be ""vintage"" Crusader stuff. It also did me a lot of good for me to hear my favorite bassist, Marcus Miller, added to the mix. He adds that touch of funk that only he can do. With Marcus thumpin' the bass, Joe tickling the ivory, and the rest of the guys doing their things, you can't help but love this piece. ""Healing the Wounds"" is probably the best Crusader cd to date. If you like the old Crusader stuff, you'll love this! It's great music from cover to cover."
4,Music That Feels Good!,"Healing the wounds is jazz the way I like it to be...good sounds that come together and make an album that you don't mind listening to againa and again. If you are new to the Crusaders, here's one to start with. Sit back, relax, and let the good vibes on this good album take you away!"
1,Would work well in an elevator,"Sorry to be the dissenter here, but I just received this CD and found myself skipping to the next track about 30 seconds into each song. Why? because it is pablem for the senses, elavator music that goes nowhere, there is zero sense of fun or adventure. It may be ""modern"" and ""sophisticated"" but it is above all boring, as if someone went out of his way to bleach out all of the groove and swing of the early Crusaders albums. The good news? I only paid 77 cents for it, which proves once again that you get what you pay for."
5,Excellent,Charges you Sansa without plugging it into the computer. Comes with the USB cable and everything. Just keep your firmware up to date and you're set.
1,cheap piece of junk,"the plug didn't even work properly. it didn't charge properly. it was cheaply manufactured, and, in essence, a piece of junk"
3,expensive,this product is nothing special but it gets the job done. i thought it was quite expensive when u include the price of shipping.
1,cheap construction,"The Macally USB AC Charger for SanDisk MP3 Players that I purchased worked fine for a short period of time, then the cheap construction allowed the slot to be pushed inside the charger, not flush with or attached to the body, so it could not be used. Plain poor quality."
2,NOT A GREAT CHARGER!!!,In September of 2010 I gave this unit a great review. Well now almost a year later I change my review. A few months ago the imput where the USB cable that attaches from the MP3 player to the unit is not holding the MP3 player and is not making a connection to charge. The cord fits in the USB port very loosely and falls out or just won't charge. Now I use the USB cable that came with it and the charger for my phone to charge the unit and that works out great. But the charger itself will just not charge the unit. It worked well for about 8 months then slowly started to get loose and sometimes make the connection and sometimes not but now it just stopped working. So you decide if it is worth it or not.
5,I needed this.,"It was not easy to find this. however, it works fine. It plugs in the outlet without a long cord. I like that.I did not know that I had to have a charger for my sansa. I wish that the retailer had this when I purchased sansa. It is costly afterall with S & H."
4,It works perfectly,"I purchased this item to charge my mp3 player, so I wouldn't have to leave it with my computer all the time. The item is easy to plug in, the lights lets you know when it's charging and has power. I have no problems with it, it's a simple item and should very rarely show any problems."
5,Macally SN-A411 USB charger,"This is a simple, inexpensive device to recharge the battery on the Sansa series 200 MP3 players. It includes a USB cable (apparently identical to the one that comes with the players). The Sansa players can be recharged from the cable using a computer's USB port, but the Macally device simply plugs into an A/C wall socket. I took it to Europe and used a simple 230 V adaptor for European A/C sockets and it recharged the MP3 player within a couple of hours. Its operating light turns green when the player's battery is fully recharged."
2,It broke,"The first time I used the charger it seemed to work fine. The second time I used it it didn't seem to be charging, the plug wouldn't stay in the socket. Upon closer inspection it appears that the plug is loose and just jiggles around in the unit. I sent it back for a replacement, thank you Amazon.Otherwise it is a nice compact size and that fact that the plug folds in is nice."
5,MP3 Charger,Great product! Works like a charm charging up me Sansa without the use of a computer. Can take it with me where every I go. It a shame it wasn't included along with the purchase of the MP3 player.
2,Cable doesn't fit well,"The USB cable doesn't fit well into the charger's port. I have to jiggle it and push it in VERY forcefully. Otherwise, seems to charge fine."
4,McNally charger is cool,The charger is pretty good.. Allows you to play music even when it is charging. Also the usb cable with the charger can be used as an extra transfer cable if your original one was lost. Overall a good buy.
5,Over 4 years of use and still works great!,I've had this charger for over 4 years and it still works perfectly. I've never had any problems with it and it's been used regularly for over 4 years.
1,He never claimed to be perfect,"If your only top 40 song was ""Walk On The Wild Side"",and the first four albums of your career were utterly ignored,wouldn't you make a noise to get noticed ?Whatever his intentions were,a two record set is a bit much of ANYBODY.A 45 would have gotten the job done cheaper.By the way,is there any other Lou Reed album that people talk about as much as MMM ?"
3,Too much of a great thing.,"I love noise, and this is one of the most gut-wretching, incredible noises ever produced. That said, I can't take it for more than five minutes at a time... it doesn't go anywhere. However, this is without a doubt one of the all-time great lease breaking recordings (the winner of that dubious award being the second side of ""Live Peace In Toronto."")"
1,PLEASE READ THE REVIEW FIRST ... ITS ALL FEEDBACK,It's a double album of feedback and that's all. A better bet is White Light/White Heat.
1,Drill your teeth clean,"""The lyrical interpretation at 13:12 of part 3 are just the greatest.Also that minor 3rd resolution from the C minor puts it all in focus"" This is the kind of nonsense some critics breathed into this turkey.Now for the real news.This was Lou's giant F#$k You to a rotten label (RCA)and a joke on his fans.Why the 1 star? Lets get real here folks.This is not a Lester Bangs inspired trek into genius,it is a commercial suicide attempt.If Lou was really serious,he would have made ""Metal Machine Music...The Sequel"" instead of ""Coney Island Baby"" as his next album.A must hear for the bored,the pretentious, and the certifiable."
1,Songs?,"I am amazed at how loosely some people use the themr 'song"" and the term 'music.' There is neither on this album. It contians nothing but feedback noise. Why anyone would waste their hard earned money on this is a complete and total mystery,"
5,Only buy this if you want to hear an hour of pure feedback,"This is one of my all time favorite albums. It belongs more in a new age catagory of ocean sounds then rock music. I've heard Loue Reed got the idea for this album from John Cale back in 1965. And yes, I've listened to this album clear through on several occasions. While concentrating on somethig else usually, but sometimes just while thinking. It is also the ultimate album to freak out your roommate at college with."
1,Lou Reed's Revenge,"This album was Lou Reed's revenge against his former record company. He recorded this album to complete his contract with them. Needless to say Reed was not at all happy and basically told them if they wanted two albums worth of material, they'd get it. Thus, you get ""Metal Machine Music"", extended white noise and feedback. After he released the album, Reed's record company released it, probably thinking Reed's attempt at professional suiside would do him in. I'm surprised it has made its way over to CD - uh, it's unlistenable.If you like this, great, but I liken it to watching white noise on the TV - no substance."
4,Not much to add,"Well, I ain't got a lot of need to say ANYTHING here, but I thought I'd note that, assuming this is the Buddha Records rerelease, it not only has the original cover art, but interviews with Lou and some historical contextualization in the liner notes, by David Fricke. For what its worth, I don't even KNOW why I feel the need to own this disc, but, damn, I do."
3,"Some good songs, some so-so songs","When I bought Metal Machine Music, I was apprehensive at first, becuase I thought he could NEVER top ""Transformer"", but when I finally listened to it, it was pretty good. I really liked the first song, and although it started out slow, it picked up by the end. The second track saw a different side of Lou Reed, one would wonder if he's possibly ""selling out"" with this track. It almost seems as if he's making it specifically for the radio. I enjoyed the third track, but the musicianship was lacking in some areas, and the lyrics were somewhat offensive to me. The fourth song ""Metal Machine Music Part 4"", however was very good. This track seemed to combine the Lou Reed of The Velvet Underground and Berlin, with the Lou Reed of today."
2,Play this to clear a room!,"Yes, it's horrible. But it is worth the price just to play it for people and gauge their reactions."
1,Get real folks,"I'd be willing to bet a bundle that the vast majority of the folks who are giving this thing 5 stars probably don't even own a copy, and the few who do never actually listen to it. After all, it is nothing but unlistenable noise, a review that The Trouser Press Record Guide refers to as ""a description, not a value judgment.""Whether Mr. reed meant this as a joke on the artsy-fartsy crowd, or simply as a way out of his contract isn't known, but it is quite safe to say that he did not mean it as any kind of artistic statement because it clearly isn't one. Unlike say, The Shaggs, who had an innocence and sincerity to their work, this is nothing but cynical manipulation, and that should not be rewarded."
1,"5 stars for the attitude - 1 star for the ""music""","somehow i knew there'd be a few dorks who give this album 5 stars and claim to enjoy it. i can understand that. i like crap as well as the next guy. if something is awful but has a decent amount of originality or creativity, it makes my list. this thing sure don't. as a middle finger to fans, critics, and record company alike, this was a truly ballsy punk thing to release. but come on, lou clearly didnt spend more than an hour making this crap. i can respect his making and even releasing it, but there's no way in hell i'm gonna put money in his pocket to OWN it. there's a whole lotta more listenable tripe out there to waste your hard earned cash on than this. the fools who said they loved it are posers who read lester bangs' gushing (yet brilliant) essay about it and wanna join the out crowd. packa nerds."
1,A Lou reed fan who's amazed!,"I just heard Lou is putting out a new double cd called ""Something on my mind"" You see it's about a guy who sitting on a toilet all day recording himself passing gas in 4 parts. Come on people, to give this bilge a serious review means you have way to much time on your hands. I would just like to condem the what ever they call themselves record company, and Lou Reed for re-issuing this pile. And warn anybody and everyone out there to save your money!"
1,JUST NOISE,"This is just noise, not manicured noise, not sculpted noise, not intelligent noise, just noise. If you want the other types of noise (sculpted, manicured, intelligent), listen to Throbbing Gristle."
4,Buyer Beware,"Not a great album, but none the less a good one on it's own terms. This album is the epitome of being an artist, and one should go in and know that this is a museum piece, not a cruising on a saturday night piece. All I know is, i've drawn on it as an influence, though I don't know what a good idea it was as an entire album. But seriously, outside of Zappa, who else ever would have had the balls to make this album? And who else could have pulled it off like Reed?"
2,Best interpreted as a gesture,"Trashing this album on musical grounds seems inappropriate since it can hardly be considered a musical work (no composition, no structure, no progression or development, etc.) So it's best reviewed as a gesture but I think it fails in that respect too. MMM is a sonic stink bomb, hurled by Lou at the industry and his fans. Even at this late date it's a depressing reminder of Lou at his mid-seventies low point of cynical contempt. That said, I am amused that this was originally a double vinyl album (not one disk of unbearable noise, but two!) And the fake concert-album packaging, while a rip-off, is not a bad practical joke. So I'll give it the extra star but this is more an album to discuss than something to actually purchase and play."
1,I'll bet Lou is laughing,I'd be willing to bet that Lou Reed is reading all these five star reviews and laughing hysterically.P.T. Barnum was right.
4,"A little simplistic, but still a pretty accurate reflection","Folks that know me know that I have well over a hundred astrology books. I wound up with this one. I am leery of the ""relationship"" or ""Sexual"" astrology books. They tend to lack the depth of astrological study and become much more cookie cutter. This one doesn't. Really has some good sun to mars descriptions that pan out fairly accurately. There is some simplicity and the depth of details could probably be greater, but I have kept it on my shelf and have enjoyed the writing style and the material included. Great for all levels."
3,Mars for intermediate astrologers and students,"This book is great for folks whom want to get to know a little more about the visceral planet of Mars and how it relates to the Sun sign. The descriptions are fairly accurate and give a good feel about Sun-Mars connections; however there is absolutely no ""nerdy"" astrological data about Mars and it's element, orbit, retrograde motion or any detailed information about the planet's nature. This book is good for light interest, but this plus more exhaustive information would be excellent and I will be searching for such a book. Thanks for reading!"
1,Uninformed. Would be laughed at by reasonable scientists.,"I agree with the author that kids should stay away frommarijuana and all other powerful drugs. Her way of preventionthough is disturbing. When you present false informationabout a drug such as marijuana, you will not be believed whenyou tell the truth about heroin or crack cocaine. The authorignores the 20 years of research disproving the brain damagestudy of Dr.Heath of Tulane University in the early 70's.The brain damage rumour exists to this day, helped by bookslike this one. Read the studies of Dr.Donald Tashkin, UCLApulminary (lung) expert in regard to marijuana use. There hasnever been a documented case of marijuana causing cancer.This author really needs to do her homework, and think aboutthe consequences of crying wolf in the name of protectingchildren."
5,The best thyroid book I've found so far!,"Not only did this book help me understand my thyroid and what it does, it helped my primary care giver diagnos my disorder. The book lists all the tests that should be done and what the normal levels should be and it has a great resource listing. It also tells how to trace thyroid problems in families. I finally have a handy resource book at home when I need it!"
5,another classic,temptations is just as classic as 'inner city griots' or 'to whom it may concern'. real diverse piece of work. slammin big beat tracks with aceys amazing raps as well as others with more melodic flows. poetic tracks like 'Fragrance' and 'best rapper in the world' could be too much for some to handle. production and lyrics always perfectly matched. FF is one of the few groups around who make real songs and not just raps over beats
2,out of nowhere and back into obscurity.,"Okay boys and girls, phrase of the day is ""FELL OFF"". Can you say ""FELL OFF""? When we use the term ""FELL OFF"", we are expressing a point of view in which a said person or group who was at one point in time very very great, has dwindled into ultimate mediocrity. Exactly what is this all about? Who is this no-name producer? Why? EXTREMELY dissapointing. (...)"
2,WHAT? this album was lame,"Yes. Fell Off. That's the best explanation I can think of myself. Sorry to burst ya bubbles all, but this album is straight up WEAK. The beats were pathetic, not one single track had a catchy beat or loop or anything. The production was amateur at best, sound quality poor. The ONLY thing this album has going for it is the lyrical skill of the Fellowship, and even that was only mediocre. I was suprised to hear that these guys have been around for a while, they sounded like it was their first album and like it was hurriedly put together without much thought to how it sounded. I took it right back to the store and exchanged it for something more worthwhile."
3,Chilton Purchase,Chilton auto books have always been the one I choose. The books are imformative and complete. The book I purchased was in good condition with no dogears or stains. For complete car car I chose Chilton.
1,Auto manual is a lemon!,"I recently bought this Chilton manual for my 2000 Honda Accord, and ""disappointed"" is an understatement. The manual was entirely generic procedures supplemented by poor quality photos and factory drawings. Worse, in two places where I have done the procedures in the past, the manual was flat out wrong. In one case, the procedure described to retract the disk brake calipers would actually damage the caliper if used. I returned the manual, and strongly recommend you stay away from the Chilton series. Hayes is better."
3,A Good Read,"Innovation Premium is a great resource book on today's emerging need to integrate Creativity and Innovation as vital elements of any business enterprise. Gone are the days of relying on effectiveness and efficiency alone.As companies around the globe learn to adopt effectiveness and efficiency programs, companies with these advantages will continue to lose those advantages in the future. Only by incorporating an innovative culture in every operation of their companies can they begin to build a new vibrant, dynamic learning organization that can withstand the test of time.Arthur D Little, Inc.'s research into the relationship between companies which are very innovative like Nokia to their performance in the stock markets are proof enough that investors and financial analysts today give premium to companies who created the right culture on excellence and innovation."
2,Street Jam Basketball,Same old style of basketball game that has been around for years. Difficult for a younger kid to compete due to the quick pace.
3,Good game,Both my sons like playing this game. It isn't one they seem to get addicted to but they enjoy it all the same.
3,An OK album,"John Lee Hooker / In Person (VeeJay Records): This is NOT a live album. This is not one of Hooker's best studio albums either, it is not bad... it's just not very memorable. This one is Just OK. Three Stars."
5,Excellent Quality,"I purchased this flatware recently, and I am truly delighted with the exceptional qualityof this set. I was also very pleased to discover that this flatware is 18/10 stainless steel...not 18/0. The smooth clean lines are modern and pleasing to the eye, and the embossed card symbols on the handles add such a unique touch. You don't have to be a card player (I'm not) to enjoy this handsome-looking set.When the package arrived and I was finally able to inspect each knife, fork and spoon, I found that every piece is well-crafted, beautifully balanced and heavy-duty. Oh, and did I mention how elegant they look on my table? I couldn't be happier with this flatware! In fact, it is probably one of the best purchases I've made online in a while, and at this price, you really can't go wrong. I even ordered an extra set to have for company...especiallyduring the holidays."
4,An Eyeopener,"A friend of mine recommended this book and I could say that it is an instant eye opener of how we should pray to God. Jabez's prayer is a simple yet powerful one. I've tried it ever since I read the book, and it has worked for me. Miracles really happen through prayer."
1,Far be it from me...,"...to discourage anyone from seeking Truth through prayer, but this book is fluff. To learn about prayer, I suggest reading Thomas Merton (Essential Writings) and C.S. Lewis (Mere Christianity), who point out that true prayer is not spoken with the lips, but rather is an experience of God's deepest love from within."
1,Theologically Devistating,"A bestseller does not necessarily a Christian classic make. Consider the following points:1. If this is a great secret to prayer, then why is it buried in one verse in a genealogy of the Old Testament?2. The book violates the number #1 rule of sound exegesis: A verse cannot mean something today that it didn't mean to the original hearers.3. When the disciples asked Jesus how to pray He surprisingly didn't refer to Jabez. If this interpretation were true, wouldn't Jesus have mentioned it??? When did WWJD become What Would JABEZ Do?4. Our problem as the Bible defines it is SIN. Not a need for blessing.5. Didn't Jesus comment on mantra-like repetitions?The botton line: You can't grab one verse in a genealogy and formulate a doctrine around it. This violates all sound theological practice. Save your money or spend it on sound teaching."
1,God as game show host!,"I have nothing against game shows, some are fun. But this book makes God out to be a celestial Monty Hall, ready to give out favors if we can only pull the correct trinket out of our spiritual wallet or handbag. I can't think of a single religion that is as self-centered as the author's take on Christianity.Isn't religion about gaining understanding and developing a relationship with God? This book makes God out to be a sugar daddy! Read a bit of ""Psalms"" every morning instead of misguided efforts like this one."
3,Madonna does a great job,too bad all of the tracks have the same music just performed alittle differently still the original dance mix is great.
2,what happened?,"I wouldn't usually give a Madonna CD single two stars, but these dance remixes have to be the worst makeovers of a Madonna song I have ever heard. Madonna has re-recorded her vocals and not for the better. She sounds bored and she oversings as if she is Shirley Bassey. The original album version was stunning and surprisingly moving, but these remixes sound campy and unintentionally hilarious. Madonna, who usually picks great DJs to remix her songs, should have found some others (Vasquez, Hex Hector?) to do the job here. A real disappointment."
5,MADONNA IS SENSATIONAL,I GIVE THIS SONG A WONDERFUL REVIEW MADONNA MADE DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA COME ALIVE SHE SHOWED THE WORLD THAT THERE IS MORE TO HER THAN JUST A MATERIAL GIRL! YOU GO GIRL. BY FRECKLES
4,No reason for tears.,"This cd single is very,very good.The first 3 songs being the best.If you are a Madonna fan, and don't have this, try to find and buy this, as it is a great addition to any fans collection."
5,Definitely worth buying,"These mixes take the ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"" song to a new level. The hip-hop beat works really well with the song. The only minor drawback is that the mixes sound somewhat similar to one another.The Spanish version is a welcome addition. I almost like the Spanish lyrics over the English ones. They really add something to the song."
5,lemme guess,"since there's no track info about this single my guess is this is not the dance remixes(it rules!) but the origial, should I say ballad or opera piece featured in the movie. yet it is slightly different than the 2cd movie sound track. it has a complete end and beginning."
1,Kindle Users Beware!,"This could have been a good buy and an excellent source for any teacher. In the kindle version I received and will return, some of the text (eg., selections from Aeschyus) is too small to read and can't be enlarged. The maps. charts. and valuable lists have the same problem. It is a production problem that is, at best, inane. It makes the entire work a dud.This is a pity. Their introduction is good, a miracle from academics, and is designed as a tool for teaching."
5,Blast from the Past,"The book arrived in good condition, and was a required textbook for a course. It is a book that gives modern people a glimpse into the past of ancient times.Thank-you"
5,Best Dance Floor Diva!!!,"Amber is back with another slammin dance anthem that will please all lovers of dance music. This track is one of her best givin the same sensual lyrics that she gave us in Sexual Li Da Di. Another powerhouse vocal performance and amazing remixes Amber proves she is the best dance floor diva out there. It's time to start giving this wonderful artist the attention she deserves.She gets hotter and hotter with each new song proving that there is no stoppin her! With lyrics like ""I put my arms around him Yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breast "" she is one artist who is not afraid to take risks and pull out all the stops to give the music industry some incredible music!"
1,Recon Customer Service,This light bar will not fit a 2011 GMC HD 3500 truck that has a factory light bar installed. The mounting holes will not line up. The light bar wiring is offset and will not line up with the factory wiring access hole. Although Recon lights look good they fill with condensation (I have had 3 sets). Contact with Recon has proven fruitless as they will not stand behind purchases made through Amazon.
3,"Interesting project, but disapointing book.","I am a bit disapointed about the book. There isn't much photographs and I was disapointed by their quality.The project is interesting but I don't think it is worth a book. Not, in the way it was made."
4,under armour top,"The shirt arrived in very good time, but it did not look like the picture which was a little frustrating. It wasn't just a grey top but like the mesh of greys and that wasn't exactly what i wanted"
4,Nice shirt!,Bought this for a 12 year old girl. Boys size XL was perfect! Will come in handy on those cold lacrosse fields!
1,sleeves were saggy at the wrist,I thought I ordered a size too big so I went down a size and had the same experience. The sleeves at the wrist were very saggy. They didn't fit like all our other under armour shirts (close to the wrist). Very odd. They drooped down from wrist so my son would not wear it.
3,Iffy,I work with several Amish communities and not sure how legite this is. I hope that those who don't know the Amish don't get crazy ideas about their culture.
2,"Such an interesting idea, but",I really wanted to like this series as it is an interesting idea. I think all of the cast had already left the Amish or had already decided to leave long before they were on the show.
4,Love these guys,"I can't remember why I started watching this show, because it sounded like it would be really dumb, but I was glad I did. They are sweet kids, just trying to get by. Drinking and smoking and out of control which is to be expected. They are overwhelmed by this new world. Like being thrown to the lions. New York is kind of like a jungle. I can't imagine how they must feel. To leave the shelter of the Amish life and comfort of familiar surroundings must be scary. To get past the mind set and mind control and brainwashing they experienced growing up. Imagine the confusion and inner demons they fight. They were told they would burn in Hell. I think they are brave. I don't judge them, I only wish them the best."
3,Interesting.... at first,"I'd had visited an Amish community once when I was 12 years old back in the late 80's. I had expected much more from this show, but as the season went on, I found bits and pieces that made me question a lot. Perhaps there is more to the Amish lifestyle than I am aware of, but this seemed to be like Big Love meets the Real World. The best part was probably the interview episodes at the end where the truth sorta comes out."
4,can't stop watching it,"This show is so interesting! I've always been a bit interested in the Amish & Mennonite lifestyle. I also was raised under strict circumstances (women wear long dresses, do not show skin, watch tv, listen to non-church music, cut hair, adorn self, etc.) Although I was only raised Apostolic. Watching this show and hearing what they went through makes my childhood seem not as bad. I also broke free from the church and went off on my own and went a bit wild just because I was so deprived from ""the real world"" and angry/hurt by the mean things done/said to me by the people who said they would always be there for me, blah blah blah. Anyways, I love watching this show even though I hear it's fake. Which disappoints me :("
5,Breaking Amish,"I love all the people in the story. Some say some of it is not true, but even if it not I love learning about the Amish life"
5,breaking amish,"all people are amazing because im knocking doors down, breaking my surround, i'm going to come through and show my sure frown let us go"
5,I loved it,"For me this was my time. I could watch this when my husband was gone and just enjoy something for me. I really enjoyed the story of these young people embarking into a world they have never seen. I enjoyed learning about the Amish and their way of life. The story line between Abe and Rebecca is just so sweet and seems so solid. I felt so good to see a man who truely loves and admires a woman. They were married on the show and it was wonderful. I was disappointed that it ended, I hope we can see more of them some day. Maybe a trip abroad with their children, or Disney world"
2,Don't bother,"Oh, my goodness. So much drama! I thought it would have more about Amish life. I was sorely mistake. Don't waste your money."
2,eh,"This show has to be fake in some way...not sure how they did it, but it seems like people are lying to get on the show or something."
3,The Reading Nurse,"The concept of the program is informative,however I find the outragious drama is getting a bit old.Pennsylvania, Central Pennsylvania is my home area and I am familiar with the Amish and Mennonite communities. I do realize that the communities are more than quilts, shoofly pie and apple butter, but come on. A little more personal growth and a little less drama? We all know that a good bit of the program is staged."
1,eh,Really bad. Not your typical Amish kids...even if they were....still a bad show. some of them have already experienced life on the other side ...and we're just watching them fall further down the rabbit hole. The rest of them...not sure what to make of them but they certainly found a group of dysfunctional amish kids....
1,Where is the new episode?!,"The newest episode aired over a week ago, but its still not on Amazon! I paid for the whole season & even sent them a complaint but nothing has happened...guess amazon just dropped the ball on this one...why am I paying for this again? I can just go watch it on some other site for free without the waiting around!"
5,Massive reference resource,"This encyclopedia is a leading resource written by leading philosophers and scholars. It is indispensible for researchers and students who need to refer to a philosophical topic or a great thinker and their thought. It is also good for the casual reader who may be interested in philosophy and wishes to learn more about the subject.The encyclopedia is very comprehensive and covers all the main areas of philosophy as well as both Eastern and Western philosophy. Jewish and Islamic and African Philosophies are also well represented. There are many biographies of leading philosophers, as well as scientists, theologians, lawyers, writers and politicians who have covered philosophical questions.The price puts this resource beyond the means of most individual buyers, but all good libraries should stock it."
2,Not recommended,"I have to replace these handles several times because the piece that screws to the door is made of cast alloy, which breaks in a few months because of the pulling stress. If the door is heavy like mine, then it will happen sooner."
5,more please,"I love this DJ,can there be anything doper than simply marvolus,Iam hopping for something new soooon."
2,"A classic, not well done","The problem with dong well-known classics is that there is a level of expectation based on other productions; although this is a BBC production, it does not rise to the level of other films. The acting is hesitant, the lines delivered teleprompter fashion. There seems to be little interaction between the characters who are in the scene together, but could well be on their cell phones the way the lines are delivered. Sorry to pan any Austen story, but there it is."
5,Very Pretty,"The acting was good and I liked the setting. They did remove the little sister, but other plays and movies have taken her out as well. Just let me say that I've seen many Jane Austen movies from the 1970s and 1980s and the costumes on this production are far the best I've seen. The colors and patterns are beautiful and despite the age of this movie I've realized that I knew some of the actors, which I liked."
3,Acceptable but...,"I'm glad there are other versions. Of the four I now have,this one is the least desirable. Also...whoever wrote theblurb on the case obviously never watched the movie. He (or she)refers to ""Elinor and Marianne...their mother and...younger sister"".Margaret doesn't exist in this version."
4,a nice step back,"I just received this fine BBC version of Sense and Sensibility and I sat down to watch with great anticipation and was not dissapointed. How nice to see Patricia Routledge as a young actress. This version, while it is a bit dated (1971), was a joy to watch. The costumes and scenery were right and the story version was true to the novel with some ommisions. The acting was not what we are used to now - still this version has merit. The part of Elinor was done well. Austen fans will love it."
2,Jane Austen defiled,"I bought this version because we needed it to complete our collection. I doubt we will ever watch it again, after viewing it once. It was painful to watch: most of the players seemed miscast, the hairstyles were straight from the late 1960's early 1970s, , and the emotions were stated but never shown by the players. We actually hoped Marianne would die and be put out of her (acting) misery. All my wife kept saying while we watched this version was ""I hope you didn't pay much for this DVD"". Definitely the worst of any of the BBC attempts at Sense and Sensibility."
3,In a bed for nothing,"A resort hotel's detective struggles to solve long-term mysterious killing of boxer visiting as struggling to meet hotel's bill pair tried to beat out money lended to a boxer manager.If one is in males undies and semi-nude group no-sex scenes in bedroom, this shot will be exactly what to watch at the dawn of the twenty-first century."
1,Awful. Even Austen addicts should avoid.,"I was interested in seeing this version particularly because I loved 'Poldark' and thought Robin Ellis and Clive Francis would be interesting to see, and I always thought the BBC could do no wrong. Oops. Clive Francis as Willoughby was not nearly as much a cad as I thought he should be, and I think Robin Ellis had a little too much gravitas to carry off the role of Ferrars - he is the polar opposite of Hugh Grant's Ferrars. I found it all too difficult to watch - I was always gaping at the 70's hairstyles (why do they give women soooo much hair? Willoughby's voluminous faux-victorian tousled hair nearly stole the show). The lighting was amateurish and the female actors were over-the-top. One notable exception was Patricia Routledge as Mrs. Jennings, who is over-the-top in her own right. Please don't bother with this. There are far, far better adaptations out there."
3,Wilfully obscure Late Godard.,"After his experimental phase in the 70's, Godard supposedly returned to mainstream cinema, but this movie isn't many peoples' idea of a mainstream movie. It's title is deceptive as there isn't much of a noir plot and most of the movie consists of scenes and conversations that don't really go anywhere. Some of these are quite amusing, like a scene where people wonder why porno movies are refered to as x-rated. But the film is mostly frustrating, chiefly to be viewed by film scholars and JLG buffs."
2,okay game,"My kids play the game, but they just don't seen interested in it very long. Needs more action and better handling or easy level for young kids like mine."
4,Nice size and color,I was pleased with this purchase. The diamonds are brilliant and almost colorless.
5,better than the first? you betcha!!,"i used to really like the sound of system of a down, now i love it. i can honestly say the wait for this wonderful disc has been worth it; top to bottom it just flat out rocks. i think it just has a better groove to it than the previous cd. a friend of mine describes their music as ""kooky, but still heavy"" and i couldn't agree with him more. the first five songs are kind of a throwback from their self titled, but after that is when it starts to sound as they are really evolving as a band. i especially like chop suey, atwa, and toxicity, but there is definetly not a bad song to be found. off the top of my head, this is the best album of the year. A MUST BUY."
3,It was used.,I got this to help with ideas in my carving. Someone ripped out the entire chapter on lettering. Fairly limited.
3,"Good, not too boring","Pretty good, used by NYU's famous professor Yermack. The small snippets about takeovers and why bankruptcies are sometimes good is great!"
1,Ugly!,"How ugly are these dolls? They look more like hookers than a child's play thing. Would you really want your child to want to be like these large headed, larger lipped, scantily dressed toys?"
1,Creeepppyyy!!!!,"These dolls are so creepy to me. My 5-yr old daughter kept on bugging for a year now to buy her one, and when I looked at it, there's no way that she is playing with these overly made-up, ghetto-looking, hooker-looking dolls. Hell NO!!! Just looking at them in the picture creeps me out already how much more of putting them away when she neglects to clean up her bedroom. And look at the feet... it's not even near cute...Creeppppyyy!!!"
1,"LIL' ""SLUTZ!""","I AM A PARENT AND I THINK THE BRATZ ARE LOSY, BAD ROLE MODELS FOR OUR YOUNG GIRLS. THIS DOLL IS WAYYYY TOO BAD. IT IS A TOO SLUTTY PACK OF FOUR HYPERSEXUALIZED DOLLS AND I THINK THE ARE DISCUSTING HO'S. DO NOT BUY BRATZ DOLLS."
5,An Innovative and Enthralling Game Expirience,"This game adds new innovation to the GBA. Nintendo has pulled off a winner by creating a game revolving around a simple but new concept, using only the L and R buttons. It presents a new challenge to veteran gamers in that you can only do things by swinging from peg to peg on the screen. It also offers a unique game expirience for new comers to the game world. I am sad to see that one mother has ruined the good rating that this game should have only because her son wasn't up to something like this and how can it use ""too many buttons"". Is using two buttons too hard for your youngster. Maybe he should stick to one button games."
3,"Probably more so for the younger ""kids"" :)","Keep my age in mind when you read this review (let's just say that I'm one of the older ""kids""). This game seemed like it could be a lot of fun. I just personally prefer the original donkey kong. I'm more into climbing ladders and jumping over barrels than I am into climbing up and up and up....and falling down and down and down. When I played this game, I tended to keep losing DK's grip and falling. So it became a bit monotonous for me to have to keep getting him back up to where he had already been....only to run out of time. Rather frustrating, I must say. Actual kids probably see this as a challenge so it would be a lot more fun for them. Besides that, kids these days are masters of video games. Not so true for my generation. Anyways, enjoy!"
4,OK Symphony,"I am surprised at the extravagant praise here on Amazon for Weingartner's Second Symphony: one of the best symphonies of all time, should be in the standard repertoire alonside Dvorak and Tchaikovsky, etc. In truth, this is better than the First Symphony, but it's no masterpiece. Repetition substitutes for development, melodies are unmemorable, and I would characterize the piece as a whole as workman-like rather than inspired. The tone poem (Das Gefilde der Seligen) starts well, but an insipid theme is introduced and mercilessly repeated, guaranteeing that I, anyway, will never listen to it again. That said, it's impossible to imagine these modest pieces presented in better performances or recordings (hence the four stars). If you like earlier installments in this series, get this one; otherwise, try other late romantic composers like Franz Schmidt, Alfven, Reger, the early Wellesz...."
3,"A Welcome Work, but...","Books on rowing are rare these days so it is good to see a fine account of a boat being made and coming together. All the more so as The Red Rose Crew chronicles the early days of women's rowing.Overall, this is a fine and enjoyable read, the only distractions being a number of minor but aggravating errors, preplexing because Boyne is a rower. These are minor in the context of this otherwise fine book about rowing."
5,Wonderful True Story of Female Athletes Making History,"This book is great read. I am a rower and former coach but this book is written for rowers and non-rowers alike to enjoy. The author pulls you into another time when femle rowers (as many other female athletes of the time) were fighting to compete at an elite, international level in a male-dominated sport. The true story is told as a part of both college athletics' and Olympic history. The challenges both on and off of the water that these women and their coaches faced are shared so clearly that you feel you are actually watching it unfold. While I knew a lot about many of the key players from other books, and rowing connections, I learned even more about these inspiring individuals that laid the foundation for so many rowers and athletes to train and compete at the highest levels since."
2,SINGING STYLE JUST TOO OVER-THE-TOP...,"... Greco's loud, quasi-operatic vibrato might sound OK in Italian, but in English, his singing style is too one-dimensional and gets really annoying after a few songs. Strictly for old-school Vegas mobsters."
4,Music for after the lights go down low,"24 great songs from 'But beautiful', 'round midnight' to some fine Italian songs like 'More' and 'Ít had better be tonight'.Arrangers Robert Mersey and Marty Manning did good work.Get some good Italian wine and listen."
5,The Book of the Blood,"This is the ultimate power register of the ruling classes. Simply, this book charts the ruling Royal and Princely houses of Europe. Traditionally considered the last word in matters of succession, protocol, and marriage. Known for it's accuracy and the publisher's inability to be bribed or pressured in matters of inclusion or exclusion. The rock against which pretenders are wrecked. Not for the nouveau riche."
1,A waste of Money...,"As a researcher in this field, I am surprised that a book of the low quality made it too print. Errors, errors and errors should be the name of this book.The editors are trading on a brand name that is over 100 years old...shame on them.Save your money and buy a different title!"
4,Tom Scott Them Changes,Great Music on a hard to find CD. I've originally lost my original CD over a decade a go and recently decided to repurchase it. Could not find this title thru other download services. Luckily Amazon had it available for shipping and received it within 10 Days! Awesome!
2,Decent buy for a flanker fan,"I bought this DVD because I am a big fan of russian fighter jets especially the flanker series. The DVD covers a trip made by the Su27 and Su30 to the US during the cold war, with the Su27 being piloted by Viktor Pugachev.What disappointed me was the photography.The cameras are always on high zoom, which doesn't allow the aerobatic manuver's to be fully appreciated.There is no commentary at any time during the video to explain the manuver's or cockpit instruments etc.However, it is still a decent buy for the flanker fan."
2,Not a professional production,"The Sukhoi Su-27 in my opinion is one of the most beatiful modern jet aircraft ever designed. I've been wanting to get a video of this aircraft for some time. This one was very disappointing. It was filmed at an airshow with a hand held video camera. Lots of jerky filming with the plane moving in and out of the frame and zoomed in on jet flying so you can't see the whole plane in the frame. There is no narration. There was some air to air filming, but again, the camera appeared to be hand held. Although the camera work was poor, the picture quality was good. I didn't pay much for this dvd. If I had I would be greatly upset."
5,Super cute,True to size and really cute shoes. I bought them to match a fur trimmed corset I own and am really pleased with these shoes and what a great price! They are definately unique and if you're a shoe fanatic (such as myself) you have to own at LEAST one pair of fur trimmed shoes! If you're looking for this style you won't be disappointed!
4,Nice addition to Barbara Cartland romances,"This story was originally written by Pamela Wynne, 1929, and condensed by Barbara Cartland. From inside the book, Barbara Cartland writes to the reader:Mary Latimer, crushed into insignificance by her boring husband, pulls at one's heart strings and will make you long as I did for her to find happiness. Her daughter, who tries to have a modern outlook but fails, is adorable. This is a lovely story in the real meaning of the word"
1,Cheap and Cheezy,"I had high hopes for this toy because I purchased it off the recommendation of another homeschooling mom's blog. I usually respect her opinion, but this time I wish I hadn't. The pieces themselves are made of a very cheap feeling plastic. They aren't even close to being sturdy. The set includes axels and wheels, but the wheels fall off of any vehicle that one tries to construct and drive around. This is quite frustrating for a young child who has worked very hard to make something out of the pieces. I tried every possible combination of parts to get those wheels to stay on and ended up tossing all of it into the garbage because it just leads to incredible frustration for anyone who tries to use it (grown-ups included). Save your money and steer clear of this one."
2,Same as before!!!,"Blah,blah,blah..same as before...No really scary bad guy,just some second rate organization..Same as before..The book is long and too many boring scenes.Its strange that the auther seems to have gotten the Smith/Harold dynamics down but fails on the mainrelationship with Remo and Chiun..Remo still tells Chiun,the father he loves, to""shut up""..again..theformer warm feeling of love between them,crutial to the story ""fabric"" is gone..The new Master of Sinanju,who will ""usher in an era greater than any that has come before""..Hasn't a clue as to what to do with himself..again,there will be those who will love this book,the old timers are still waiting..."
1,Oy,"What is wrong with Gold Eagle? Don't they care about selling books? Obvioulsy not. Don't make the mistake I made, DON""T BUY THIS BOOK."
4,"Punchy, punk-ish, straight ahead rock 'n'roll","Together with thrash wonder guitarist Robert Quine, Reed takes the stage to rush through a set of songs that will leave you panting just by listening. The key here is speed as the band delivers punk-ish and bare bones renditions that gallop along like a maniac on a mission. Add to this Quine's frenzied morse code solos and led heavy rhythm and the effect is nothing short of stunning. Reed's voice (he still growls and sings here) is irreverent and wrathful while the rest of the band contribute to the no-nonsense driving pace (Maher's drums) and timely countermelody (Saunder's bass). Live recordings seldom sounded this raw and enthralling. Without a doubt, Reed's best album of the 80's."
2,2 1/2 Stars,"Recorded in 1983 with Lou's most critically acclaimed band since the Velvet Underground..""Live In Italy"" comes with a lot of hype and promise.The band is far from tight and not in very fine form at all here. Reed's voice is totally shot and he compounds the problem by seemingly insisting upon shouting and screaming his way through much of the material.Very raw and very hard to listen to...""Live In Italy"", with all it's clamor, is almost the direct opposite of ""Perfect Night In London""..meaning it's the weakest of Reed's live releases.For hardcore Reed fanatics only."
1,"Overlong, ponderous and depressing","""First Resort"" isn't any sort of a book that should be given to anyone looking for an entertaining read. It is about 100 pages too long and loaded with the sort of self-important dialoge that makes the reader want to slap the characters (or the author) silly for wasting so much of our time. There is nothing about the golfing portions of the book that will enlighten the uninitiated, and little to spark the interest of long-time golfers. Oftentimes the writing is clinical and choppy, especially the chapter that drones on and on and on about Freudian psychology: one wonders why. Freudian psychology is about as mysogynistic as one can get, especially in a purportedly lesbian novel. I also thought it was creepy that the women pictured on the cover don't have any mouths. Is it possible that ""First Resort"" was actually written by a man? Based on how it is written and how it reads I wouldn't be surprised."
2,Not up to par.,"I have read Ms. Little's other books previous to this one and enjoyed them more. I found that Jordan's character was a bit much. I thought that she was just way too good and experienced at too many varied things. Also, I do believe that intense relationships can occur in short time frames, but the relationship characterized in this book did not seem plausible to me. The transition from a scared, severely battered wife not able to be touched to having a physical relationship with a gay woman in one week is difficult to swallow."
1,I must be missing something,"I couldn't disagree more that the excessive alcohol abuse was a cautionary comparison to ""The Great Gatsby."" Actually, I thought the author flattered herself by even mentioning Fitzgerald. This effort is pedestrian.I don't see where characters ""live and breathe"" on the page: I don't see fictional characters like these breathing in real life! Multitalented is one thing, fantastical egotrip is another.I don't get it. I read this book on reccommendation from someone else who read ""Thin Fire"" and liked it. That one was out of print, so I got this one instead. I'm sorry I did. I think its too flowery, too dramatic and too unbelievable to be fiction without being labeled ""fantasy"". Her other books might be good, but this one isn't up to par."
5,Great classic,"My husband and loved this movie. Great film. Barbara was absolutely wonderful, her performance with Dennis Morgan and Sydney Greenstreet superb. Wonderful Christmas film, I recommend this one for your collection."
5,Classic Cheesy Christmas,Christmas in Connecticut is a refreshingly cheesy reminder of a time not so long ago. It is family friendly and great for date night around the Holidays.
5,Holiday fun!,"A movie I was curious to see, as the storyline was intriquing since I live in CT. Well done and very funny! A classic, they just dont make them like this anymore."
4,'Comfort-Food' Rx for Holiday Stress,"Ahhh, s i m p l e. No drunk or swearing Santas. No cookie-cutter 'made for TV' waste of time. Worth an annual look."
5,Dandy just dandy!,Excellent movie! It is a must watch. No foul language. Just a wonderfully written movie. Nothing like a bit of comedy added in for just the right recipe. Enjoy this with the entire family. It is well worth it. Sure to please.
3,Christmas in Connecticut dvd,"I love this movie, but it has some glitches in it. Sometimes it just stops, or jumps words. I am glad I have it, I just expected it to work perfectly because it was purchased as NEW!!!"
4,Nostalgic recollections,"This movie was a staple at Christmas -- clean, funny, terrifically entertaining, familiar faces, well known actors. Script was written by a friend of mine and I missed seeing it on TV the past few years. Now I have my own copy and can enjoy showing it to the younger set whenever I feel like it. Stanwyck played in it, she didn't write it! Its good clean fun any time of year."
4,CLASSIC CHRISTMAS CARD.,"A picture about Christmas in the country, a wonderfully funny, romantic Christmas. It bubbles over with merriment and radiates good cheer like a Christmas tree with all the lights lit. This is a surprisingly well-known film (they play it on television every year at Christmastime) and it's highly entertaining. Stanwyck is winning as Elizabeth Lane, (Betty Crocker personified) who writes a cooking column for a housekeeping magazine (in actuality, she knows nothing about either subject) When a soldier comes to her home for the holidays, she must either master the ways of housekeeping of reveal her incompetence. Dennis Morgan is very likable here and the creepy Reginald Gardiner is amusing as the man who tries to win over Stanwyck. The plot is thin as air and the direction is rather unsure, the script and pacing could have been better - but just sit back and enjoy this little flick - it never claimed to be a Sturges masterpiece. Also available in digital colorized version."
5,"Feel-good simplicity, comedy classic","This has long been one of my favorite films. Not only does it have an outstanding cast but the story is classic, feel-good comedy. Barbara Stanwyck is flawless, playing her role understated rather than over the top which counters the zany goings-on around her nicely. Reginald Gardiner's subtle portrayal of a man more in love with his achievements than with his fiance is very funny, and the rest of the cast is equally enjoyable. A good holiday watch!"
5,Michele's First Review,"This was a wonderfully comical and good hearted movie based on old fashioned values. It's a definite classic, in my opinion!! The first time I saw it was on Turner Classic Movies and I didn't know the title, and therefore really didn't know it was a Christmas movie. But it was absolutely funny, cute and a delight!!! It's nice to see them provide a soldier with a homey Christmas. This movie is romantic, funny, and best of all it's about Christmas!! I love Christmas movies."
3,Christmas in Connecticut,It is truly an old-fashioned movie. The story is a simple one but it is nice to see the stars from days gone by.
4,Refreshing and fun!,"We liked it a lot. It's refreshingingly without profanity, characters adhere to good strong morals, just cute; of course, notas complicated as today's, nor as fast moving, but fun!"
5,A Classic!,"This is one of the best holiday movies! We watch this yearly, and it never gets old! There is nothing to worry about little kids watching, and it's a wonderful family movie."
4,Christmas in Connecticut,"Owned this movie in VHS and always a must see at Christmas. Ordered DVD to continue the tradition.Wonderful funny,feel good Christms classic."
4,Christmas in Connecticut,A delightful reminder of the clever scripts of yesteryear-a fun movie from the start.
4,Really fun movie,"Fun, cute movie. I'd never seen this movie before , it will become one of my favorite Christmas must watches over the holiday."
4,Christmas in Connecticut,Christmas in Connecticut is a great film. The first time I watched the movie was about 12 years ago. Now it's a must to watch it at least 3 times during the Christmas Holidays. If you have never seen the movie you should.
1,What happened to the color?,"I like this movie, it's one of our Christmas favorites, but who came up with the frigging idiotic idea of- instead of black and white- the movie is PURPLE and crappy light green! It's really a disappointment. Additionally, the picture shakes constantly. The VHS version is much better."
2,Unlikable main character,"I was dissapointed in this movie. The main character, Elisabeth Lane, was found to be rather unlikable and seemed to do a rather poor job acting. The housewife seemed to decidedly lack morals and was wont to give into her romantic impulses rather quickly. I won't be recommending this movie to others as it does not live up to the wholesome classic movies that I love. The premise of the movie sounded good, but overall did not live up to expectations."
5,"Love it, but can't find it :.(","My mother and I saw this cute movie way back in the early 80's when Beta was still around. We taped it on Beta, but now we can't even find that tape. We both just love this movie, it was on t.v., but now they play the awful 1992 version. If you have this video, I would consider you to be very fortunate. p.s. if you do order it online, they always tell you after you place the order that they all of the sudden don't have it. Very annoying."
2,Far Down My List of Holiday Classics,"Let me preface this by saying I love to watch ""It's A Wonderful Life"", ""White Christmas"" and ""Holiday Inn"" every holiday season. A friend of mine recommended this film as a holiday classic.Compared to the others, it pales miserably. The plot is stretched far too thin, and there's only one - ONE - song in the whole movie. If you're not going to have a good plot, at least provide some good song and dance (and in that era, song and dance was at its best). If you're not going to have any singing or dancing, then give us a plot.For those who love any and every movie from that era, by all means get it. For those who love any and every holiday movie, go ahead and get it. For those who want a little more, don't waste your money. Get one of the films I've listed above, or a modern classic like the George C. Scott ""Christmas Carol""."
2,A classic it's not,"Hmmm, sorry to take issue with the positive reviews, but this one is a clunker. The acting is respectable (outstanding in the case of Greenstreet and Sakal, the two veterans from ""Casablanca""), but the plot is goofy and the script leaves much to be desired. Stanwyck, who is supposed to be pretending to be a country housewife, is required to let the cat out of the bag at every turn (apparently not realizing that she has a baby, not realizing what a cow is, and other such idiocies). Invest instead in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947), ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" or the Alastair Sim rendition of ""Scrooge"" (""A Christmas Carol""). Those are the true classics of the season, with messages that will delight, year after year. Even ""Holiday Inn"" and ""White Christmas,"" both fairly slight fare, are a step up from this. (Update 5/4/08: To the list of more enjoyable Christmas movies, I'll add ""Love, Actually."")"
4,It Wouldn't Be Christmas Without It,"This one is right up there with Holiday Inn, Miracle on 34th Street, and The Bishop's Wife as must see every holiday. Yes, the plot is thin, but it's just plain fun to watch and is sure to get you in the holiday spirit. I own it on VHS and Laser but can not figure out why it has not be released on DVD. If Warner Brothers still owns the rights, I hope you will release it soon. It has been three years since I bought my DVD and have been waiting every Christmas since then for its release."
4,Delicious!,"I thought this movie was hilarious. Barbara Stanwyk's Elizabeth Lane is--horrors!--the sort of unwomanly woman who buys herself mink coats, who invents a husband and baby for her magazine column and who (gasp!) can't cook. When her publisher, who doesn't know she's a sham, invites himself and a war veteran for Christmas dinner, Elizabeth has to think fast in order to keep her job. The comic possibilities are endless. My husband and I both enjoyed this charming comedy."
5,Christmas in Connecticut,"Excellent old movie. My husband was the first to see it on T.V., then I saw it and had to own it. It's just a great old fashioned Christmas movie."
5,What's not to love?,What's not to love about this movie? It is a family favorite at our house. Best under appreciated character? Uncle Felix. Listen carefully for his one liners. They are the best.
5,I love this!,My mom and I used to watch this while I was growing up. I love it!! Never gets old! I'm not much of an older movie fan but this is easy to sit through with a cup of hot chocolate and family at your side. Perfect Christmas movie!
4,Pleasant Christmas Movie,Fun holiday comedy with Barbara Stanwyck as a phony Martha Stewart type who is forced to play hostess to her unsuspecting publisher and a war hero during Christmas.
4,Good Christmas Story,Great character actors from the heyday of Hollywood. A treat to watch every year. Nice addition to holiday movie collection.
2,Beware--contains bleach,"This does get my dishes pretty clean. Although it is more ecologically friendly than other dishwashing detergents that contain phosphates, it still contains bleach, and that is not very eco-friendly. In my on-going search for a good, ecologically friendly dishwasher detergent, I have started using Method's detergent tabs. Method's tabs can be found at Target. They get my dishes as clean as (maybe cleaner than) this gel, but without the bleach. I have had problems with other eco-friendly detergents not doing a good job, so I am fine with paying a little extra for the Method tabs since they actually work."
1,cheap dreck,Another piece of amatuer $100 budget piece of junk. Made with a camcorder in someones house. Assylom has yet to release a direct to Blockbuster DVD that rates more than one star.
2,SKIP this!!,A quick read and totally predictable. Not worth the time or money unless it is free. Thank God it was under a buck.
1,trite wooden & boring,"This book does not develop a single character, is wooden and so unbelievable one has to sit back and say ""shall I read one more page or hang it up now?"" The writing is equivalent to what one would expect to find in a junior high school creative writing class. I regret the time I put into finishing it and if I can discourage anyone else from reading this book, it might be worth what I paid for it."
3,Simple basic story of revenge: The star system can't evaluate it,"This is a blunt simple basic story of revenge. There is very little development of the characters or the potentially complex story line. A couple witnesses a murder. The woman gets raped on her wedding night by the murderers. She was a virgin waiting for her wedding night to give herself to her only love.It was hard to assign a number of stars. It is excellent for what it is. Furthermore, I am not sure we need to know anything about how this crime effected the couple, the brutality speaks for itself.I loved the book, and it is deeply satisfying on every level. It was written by a master story teller.So why only 3 stars? It is outstanding for what it is.Yet ultimately I feel 4 & 5 stars must be for true pieces of literature.This is not great literature. It would be an outstanding 2 hour TV movie.It is a dead ahead no frills no insights no emotional discussions well written story of loss and satisfying revenge.Melvin Morse"
5,You have to read this....,"I have been a fan since the first cartoon. Todd is very funny in this book, if you watch the cartoons you hear the voice through the whole book. I finally got my copy and laughed non-stop to the end. If you buy the book, read it as soon as you get it, you will have a much better day, week, life.....might be a stretch.Keep 'em coming Todd!"
5,Why does thing only go up to 5 stars?,"This book is really the best book I have ever read. Well, I skimmed it more than I read it, but there are TONS of words and I'm wicked busy a lot of the time. Anyway, Odd Todd seems like he really knows how to spend a day accomplishing nothing at all. The book reminded me a lot of Pride and Prejudice, but is totally different. My best friend Claudia just ordered this book, and even though she hasn't read it, she can tell she's gonna love it."
3,"Definately OddTodd, but gets old pretty quickly...","I found that anything beyond the OddTodd 5 minute flash-animation gets boring pretty quickly. Really quickly.Still, If you're an OddTodd fan, buy the book. You will probably flip through it once or twice and then leave it on the cof-ay table. When you next have a Part-ay your friends (real or imaginary) will pick up the book and chuckle a little bit.(Plus you will feel good about helping out OddTodd, who's 5 minute flash-animations made you laugh at work, at home, or while stealing the 'net at your employed friends' houses)"
3,The Doggfather has caught the Vapors?,"Snoop is lacking a decent story, all though he tears up Biz Markies original, he doesnt seem 'funky' enough. Still a good track, but not his best fro the Doggfather album."
2,okay but like biz markie's version better,could have been better sampling in rap music is one thing but sampling samples is a little bit too much. there are a few outtakes from the doggfather sessions on youtube that should have came out.
2,Average at best,"I wasn't feeling this Cover at all really.after Biz Markie anything else is flat to me.now Snoop was rolling after His First Album,Projects with Dr.Dre,etc.. but this Song was just like the Album ""Doggfather"" Flat&Predictable.Snoop has done beter Songs&Covers&this isn't it."
1,I was very disappointed with this video,"I wish I could return this video. Having bought two other videos (Massage for Health and The Classic Art of..)which are excellent, I was spoiled. This video is almost ALL talk. Very little 'hands on' massage is shown. I could have bought a cassette if I just wanted to HEAR about it!"
2,Incomplete product,"Although the book was in good shape, the pattern insert was missing. That was the part I wanted."
4,Missing inserts,This was supposed to come with 12 inserts for the different blocks. I was looking at it and thinking of starting a quilt and there is only 1 insert (Spring Flowers)
5,Budding with Magic,"To those already Cocteau Twins fans, this is pure delight. Harold Budd's collaboration with Cocteau Twins remains to this day one of my favorite pieces of music. The lush soundscapes of Guthrie, Raymonde & Fraser blend perfectly with Budd's light touches of atmosphere, delivering a music unlike anything I have ever heard. It's as if someone bottled sunlight and moonbeams. I'm usually a skeptic but albums like these make me believe in magic. ""Memory Gongs"" might just be what I'd like to hear on my deathbed. This is one of music's best kept secrets."
4,"go home, mr budd!!!","this album would have been as perfect as any other cocteau twins release it there wasn't harold budd to play all alone at least two tracks. but when you hear liz fraser, kookaburring in that gorgeous way, you just want to listen to them again and again... you should have it on vynil......"
4,Nice Coloring Book for Toddlers,"This is a really nice coloring book for toddlers, showing the major Bible stories. It was a little shorter than I would have liked, but maybe that's for the best with little ones."
4,Campaign Gettysburg,"This is a game for people insterested in strategic civil war gaming. It doesn't have fancy graphics, it does have good email play capapbilites."
3,"If you like to use the mouse, this game is for you",It gets kind of old moving every little tiny unit over and over again. Difficult to keep track of hundreds of units. Just a little too much to be fun.
3,Good,"It sure meets the expectations and keeps the stuff in it cool. But its always recommended to keep ice in it and is not quite suitable for big families and much cheaper and bigger are available in any stores (Walmart/family dollar ) , so you may wanna check those out before ordering. They are around $14 - $20 with wheels and much bigger in size"
5,A gem for speech teachers/students,"This unique book takes apart MacArthur's rhetorical effectiveness--in some cases, almost word by word, sentence by sentence. As a college speech teacher who often played tapes of MacArthur for my students to illustrate strategoes for speaking memorably and effectively, I found this book a goldmine of insight. OBVIOUSLY, it's not an ""introduction"" to MacArthur or meant to be! The previous review reminds me of a kid's report that he went to the ballgame and hated the hotdogs!"
2,Poor sound,"The sound of this boom box is very poor, sounding muffled and distorted. I did not expect great sound from a portable, but not this bad. Much of the music I listen to is unrecognizable when played on this machine."
2,coby cd boombox,im not happy with it i really thought it was going to have some boom to it but it doesnt i might as well hve kept my previous radio im going to buy me a new radio i dont like this at all
5,I would give it 10 STARS if I could...,"My only critism of this CD, is that it did not include the original version of 'Go away'. Then again, maybe that one should have been include on the 12"" CD release. The recording quality is second to none. They used the original cover of the first released vynil, so none of the bonus tracks are on the back cover track listings. This is made up by the pull out bilingual sleeve and includes lyrics too! These songs are just as fresh today as they were in 1985. A testiment to the timelessness of the quality of Rose McDowall and Jill Bryson's superb musical skill and insights. Most would catagorize this ""PopGothic"", but it is more than just an inane label. It's ART and it sould be comtemplated and pondered upon as such. My favorite tracks? All of them and the album should be listened to as one set piece and judged as such."
3,rose in her poppy phase,"I'm a big fan of Current 93 and Saint Etienne, so it's bloody natural that I like these celtic Pet Shop Boys. Good news is that you can't get it on vinyl anymore, so your backward-masking worries are none to worry. As kid I was engulfed by the odd messages it put forth whilst rotating the vinyl version of said album with me index finger. Well, you can't do that with the CD Format version. at least your soul is now safe."
2,overdone 80s production,"This just didn't appeal to me.Sorry.The production quality put me in mind of Belinda Carlyle solo in the 80s.That would be excusable if I found the songs catchy or something.I didn't.Now,I love Rose Mcdowall,but I can't give this the thumbs up."
3,STOLEN:,"I have to admit I was a little disappointed with this movie. Although the acting was good the story was common. In other words...I'VE SEEN MOVIES LIKE THIS BEFORE. Still, I would recommend it for those who don't mind repeats."
4,Good Quality,"I got two of these mini muffin pans for the up-coming holiday season. They are called Basics, but I am very happy with their quality. The nonstick surface is thick and the pans are solid. They actually look like a lot more expensive pans. Putting them in the top rack of the dishwasher works well and does not damage the pans or their surfaces. I recommend these."
5,Great pan - great price,"I bought 2 of these, and I love them. Muffins pop out easily - I turn the pan upside down and tap it on the counter. Washes easily - I know, I could put into dishwasher, but I don't want anything compromising the non-stick coating. These fit perfectly into my toaster oven which I move outdoors for the summer -- so I can bake and not heat up the kitchen and house."
2,Strange but with a message,"The movie is an attempt to talk about Krafft-Ebing work to understand and classify human sexuality confined as he was by Victorian morality and science. The problem is that it attempts to focus on at least five different cases, sometimes skipping between one and another. The result is that I could not feel much of anything for any of the stories except that of the young woman and her governess who are lesbians. I was amused by the ending which demonstrates that even the ""best therapy"" may not be a cure for what society considers sexual problems. Regardless of the warnings the movies feels the need to have, it is not very sexual explicit nor did I find it particularly arousing. I also didn't think ""Victorians are weird"" but instead ""Victorians were sad"" but I knew that before from working with the ideas and erotica from that period."
2,Boring Fetishism,This movie was really really boring. Seeing the birth of fetishism but the plot sucks. It this was going to be in vignettes they could a least started with a story and finish. So movies do benefit between going be stories it made it worse. Do waste your time. I stream it on Netflix.
2,not impressed,i bought this video to show in a class that i teach on sexuality. i was under impressed.
5,I love it!,"If you like these guys and love to watch them interact with eachother then you will LOVE this dvd. It has hilarious home video taped by Joey himself and everytime I watch it, It makes me laugh out loud. I wish they would release more of this kind of footage of the guys just messing around. I could watch them forever! Most of the footage is from 1997 while they were overseas, and before they were well known over here in the states. If you love nsync, you have to own this!"
5,Great choice..,that is an amazing choice.. I'm in love with this brand so much I bought it as a gift and I fell in love with the bag so I bought three more one for me and the are gifts.. It's unique and realy stylish and what I like about the most is that it comes with dust bag so that shows how classy is the brand and @ the same time so funky.. Well I love it and I will buy more and More as a gifts and to my self
3,No more atom smashing,"Fermilab officially smashed their last atom with the Tevetron earlier this month (October 2011). The Tevetron is now closed. I am not sure if that will have any impact on peoples view of this movie but it is good to know before watching. While the people in the film complain about funding cuts maybe now viewers like some of the other reviewers can have a little more sympathy for them. It would appear they were afraid of not having their job eventually and that probably struck fear in all of them. As it has with millions of other people from different industries.The movie does not cover their work in great detail which is what I was hoping for. I wouldn't watch it again but I am not upset about spending time the first time through. If you can watch it for free and have at least a hint of interests and nothing even remotely important you could be doing, then watch it. If you don't meet all of those per-requisites I wouldn't recommend this movie."
3,documentary,"It mostly puts a human face to the scientists looking for the ""God Particle"", Higgs Bosom. It really doesn't get much into the science itself. Now that CERN is scheduled a new experiment in Feb 2010 maybe they can find it since Fermilab is now pretty much gone."
2,its kinda like a real world,"i agree, its not really a scientific documentary or anything... it just shows you a little bit about the people who are working on the most amazing things ever. it doesnt really talk about the actual amazing things, which i found to be extremely dissapointing. not sure who this is really aimed at, its not good enough 'reality tv' for your wife to like it, and it doesnt have any science in it for a 'techie guy' to like it... so really... its like its made for a high school science class or something."
1,Another bit of Evidence,"Laughable. This documentary is more an Anti-American liberal rant/screed than anything else.I noticed the film-makers went out of their way to slam Republicans (18 minutes in you'll hear ""and all would be well with the world...and the Republicans would be voted out of office. Oh I'm sorry. I assume you can edit this."" ...fades to George W. Bush pin with sub-title ""Nucular"").Anyway, this is just another bit of evidence as to why PBS/NPR must no longer be funded by the American tax payer."
2,Another Warren Worshipper trying to get rich off the man.,"This book is simply a summary of all the other books about Warren Buffett. It is interesting & tries to distil the concepts, but doesn't really add to our investment knowledge, unless you haven't read anything about Warren before. The continual references to Jack Welsh also seem redundant. You would be much better off reading ""Making of an American Capitalist"" by Roger Lowenstein which is the definitive Warren text. However, it is easy to read & gives a good overall view of the Buffett approach, but a lot of it is assumption or extrapolation based on other writers, shareholder letters & a bit of psychology thrown in for good measure. No important players were actually interviewed & given that the writer is based in the UK it appears he just pulled out his collection of Warren books, a psych. text & Jack Welsh's biography then started writing. The Warren worship is getting a bit tired."
3,Mainly paraphrasing with some unique insights,"This book consists largely of quoting and paraphrasing Buffett. There are a few original insights which is why I give this book three stars and not two. It largely takes a ""big picture"" perspective looking at Buffet's management, leadership and capital allocation skills. It omits what I consider the most interesting part of his methodology which is the ""low level"" process of valuation, identifying durable competitive advantage and spotting mispriced opportunities. Overall a decent book but not for the ""must read"" list"
2,author had trouble communicating,"i read this book about 3 years ago, i don't remember much, i guess the info was ok. but what i do remember is the author really didn't know how to get his points across. I think he needs a better editor."
4,Proof Text,"Bruce J Malina's book on the Jesus group may come of as slightly pedantic, but overall it is rewarding. I consider a lot of the anthropology and social psych that went into this book to be something of the proof text for a lot of the unexplained or unelaborated claims that go into his commentaries. Make no mistake this book is highly academic, while it is being marketed as a book for everyone, it is not. If socio-linguistics, social heirarchy theory, and anthropology are your thing then this book is for you, but if your looking for a vigorous engagement with the laymen elsewhere Dr. Malina's commentaries are sparkling and elite."
5,Great collection. A classic.,"Easily one of my favorite albums, with an infectious mix of jazz fusion, latin, and even some calypso thrown in for good measure. I love the trademark blend of Chieli Minucci's creative acoustic and electric guitar with George Jinda's diverse rhythms and percussion instruments. This album contains a cherry-picked selection from the Peace of the World, Double Feature, Global Village, Mystique, Just Like Magic, Slice of Life, Modern Manners, and Confidential albums. My personal favorites are Jazz Lambada, Uptown East, Daybreak, Udu Voodoo, and My Place in the Sun (recorded from 1985 - 1993). It's 73 minutes of heaven. The music of Special EFX has broad appeal; try playing it at a social event and see for yourself."
5,Super Safe Lock,"I bought these locks when my husband's gym locker at the YMCA got broken into with a regular Masterlock on it. The staff explained that regular locks only have one ""notch"" on the locking mechanism which allows for a particularly strong person to open it (sans bolt cutter) by inserting a gym towel through the lock and pulling down forcefully. These locks however have 2 ""notches"" on the locking mechanism, making it virtually impossible for this trick to work. In addition these have titanium shackles which means Mr. Regular Bolt Cutter won't work either. They are about 3x more expensive than the regular Masterlocks, but hey if you want to be sure that your stuff is still there after your workout spend thr dough, totally worth it."
2,Naval Espionage Fact or Fiction?,"Naval Espionage Fact or Fiction?This book is a racy account of the much speculated fate of Commander Lionel Crabb who failed to return from scrutinizing a visiting Soviet warship, based on a purported dossier of interrogation of Crabb, and his transition to Soviet naval officer status. Overall, I have found this book to be highly readable and although the material is dated it is still historically significant in the study of modern special warfare. I believe that this title will appeal to the professional and armchair military historian and serving military personnel."
4,"Not to be confused with the Johnny Cash biopic ""Walk The Line.""","The Gregory Peck movie ""I Walk The Line"" advertised here is not to be confused with Johnny Cash's biopic ""Walk The Line."" Gregory Peck's film is an excellent movie. However, buyers looking to purchase Johnny Cash's biopic will be disappointed if they mistakenly buy ""I Walk The Line."""
5,"I walk the line with grorory peck .An excellent drama,not to be confused with with johnny cash-i walk the line.","This is an excellent drama and love story.I have been waiting for this release on dvd for a long time.As it has been stated by my fellow reviewers,You could end up getting the wrong version of i walk the line.I just had to reorder the other walk the line.I ordered both titles,but i got two of the johnny cash's i walk the line.i should be getting the correct version soon.Well i give both movies 5 stars and i highly recommend this movie with gregory peck!!!!! I thank you Stewart L."
2,too big for my baby's mouth,"the red part is way too big for baby's mouth. my baby does not like it at all. she occasionally tries to chew on the leaves part, but that is it. i don't recommend this product."
5,This product is awesome!!,"My six month old son absolutely loves this. He chews on it more than sucking on it. I think it soothes his gums quite a bit and when he's fussy it really works to calm him down. I would highly recommend this product to moms with fussy, teething babies."
3,Didn't work for us,My son was a quick teether with two teeth coming in at once every time. I purchased this hoping it would alleviate some pain. He never took to it. He didn't seem to like the bumps on it.
1,Too big for my 5 month olds mouth,It's too big and he ends up gagging on it. I'm better off with him chewing on his Soothie pacifier. Maybe eventually he will like it but for now he just gets frustrated.
1,very large,"I was very excited for this to show up in the mail...when i tried to use it, it was way to large and my daughter wanted nothing to do with it."
4,My Grandson loves it!,My grandson loves the Raz-Berry when his gums hurt. The first time he tried it he wasn't sure what I had given him. Now he loves it. He prefers it being frozen. I bought two so he could chew on one while the other is getting cold in the freezer. A great product for teething.
5,BEST BABY TEETHER,"MY DAUGHTER JUST HAD A BABY. HE IS 5 MONTHS OLD. HE WAS TEETHING BADLY AND WAS VERY CRANKY. THE OTHER TEETHING PRODUCT WAS TOO BIG FOR HIM TO HOLD, OR PUT IN HIS MOUTH. HE ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS.HE CAN HOLD IT VERY EASY. HE DOES NOT TALK YET,BUT IF HE DID, HE WOULD SAY HE LOVES THE TASTE TOO!!!"
4,I liked it but my son doesn't yet.,"It's solid, unlike some reviews claim. I think they probably changed how it was made. Nevertheless, I keep an eye on my son while he's using it but he's not quite old enough to hold it for himself and he just pulls it out everytime we put it in. He does this with anything we give him though because he's just starting to realize he has hands. Anyway, I can tell that he'll like it once he starts seriously teething. For now it's just blankets and fingers. Lol!"
4,great teether but handle needs to be thicker,"I bought it when my daughter was almost 5 months. She liked putting it in her mouth, but she couldn't because the handle is so tiny that she couldn't hold it firmly and it kept slipping away. By the middle of 6moths she enjoyed it a lot, but it still is doing the same thing. I think its handle needs to be little bit thicker so that babies can hold it fimrly and it stays put."
4,Teething and this does work,"My 7-month old just got his two lower teeth and is definitely teething. He's always trying to ""gum"" his pacifiers rather than suck on them these days, so I thought I'd try this. He really does like it, and it seems to help. I'd recommend it."
5,Great idea!!,"My son was not too sure at first because this item did not ""work"" like a normal pacifier, but once he realized he can chew on it, he LOVED it!! It's easy for him to grab the handle on the back and chomp on any part of the item. He's 5 months old and learning to grab things so this was a nice safe thing for him to work with."
2,Too big,"This doesn't work as a soother because it's just too big. My daughter is teething late. At 17 months, she's finally getting in four teeth at the same time. It has been miserable for her and I thought the rough texture of this soother would help but she can't comfortable keep it in her mouth. She'll play chew for a bit so it's not completely useless. I just don't know how a younger child would be able to use this."
3,A little big for a small mouth,"Our little guy has not used this much. He does not seem to like the feel of the bumps on his tongue, but we are still working on that.Seems a bit too big for an early teether. Our little one is only 3 months and we were looking for something he did not have to hold, due to still developing the fine motor skills. This is a bit too big for a 3 month mouth.Holding out hope that it will come in handy in the future when he grows a bit."
5,Love it!,I bought this for my five month old who has started to chew on everything! My baby absolutely loves it. It resembles a pacifier so she can hold it and chew on the whole thing! I absolutely recommend this teether to all mothers out there!
3,cute but,It's soo cute that I really wanted to like it. It has too many sharp molding edges. It looks like it has been glued to the green part. I could forgive that if there wasn't shave marks from where something/someone tried to cut the molding seams. Way over priced for all the flaws. I was planning on getting a couple of these. I'm glad I waited till I made my first purchase.
3,Just okay.,"This teether is okay. My daughter will chew on it for a few minutes, but would rather chew on her normal pacifier."
5,great for babies gums,My son loves this teether it helps soothes his gums when they are in pain. I would recommend to all mothers
2,handle gagged my son and made him throw up,"the idea of this product is good and my son seems to like the raspberry part of it. however, he ended up putting the handle in his mouth which gagged him and caused him to throw up. the handle should be shortened so this doesn't occur. i can't say that we'll stop using it b/c he enjoyed chewing the raspberry, we'll just have to watch him constantly with it."
3,good,"I guess my baby is a bit too small for this now, she's 4 months and cannot hold this herself, when I hold it for her, she seems to like the texture. It's interesting, maybe when she gets a bit bigger we'll use it more"
2,Not a big hit,"M child only chews on the ring and ""stem"" of this product. The ""nuk/pacifier"" part is too big to chew on and she doesn't like to suck on it like a normal nuk."
3,Was hoping for a miracle.. this wasn't it.,"I am a stay at home mom who takes care of 2 additional kids during the week. My daughter (11 months) and a boy I babysit (9 1/2 months), are both teething. I purchased this product for each of them in hopes that it would give them something to relieve some of the pressure on their gums. In theory it seems great because its shaped like a binky but has bumps to rub on the gums. In reality neither child cared for it. It is bigger than a standard binky so I feel like it was too big for their mouth. My daughter hated it. The boy I babysit played with it maybe a couple minutes and was back to chewing everything else. Every child is different so it may work for other kids but my experience was not what I had hoped for."
2,The Raspberry is TOO BIG,"My 3 month old is chewing on everything and needed something to soothe his little gums, He is now 4 months old and the raspberry is HUGE! It takes up his whole mouth which im affraid of, since it gags him. hahaha"
2,not what I expected,The plastic feels flimsy compared to other teether products. My daughter did not like this teether as much as others.
3,interesting teether,My little guy hasn't quite figured this out yet. He doesn't know whether it's to suck on or chew on. We've only given it to him a handful of times and he usually has a look of confusion on his face while he figures out what to do with it. I definitely like the concept though.
4,Not like other teethers,I was so excited the instant I received this my son started chewing on it and rubbing it across his gums he won't use any of the other teethers I bought him. He's able to get it in his mouth and manuver it clear to the back of his gums instead of just the front like with the other teethers. He looses interests and throws it on the floor alot but what baby doesn't. I leave it handy and he always goes after it again.
3,"OK, BUT IT'S HUGE FOR BABY'S MOUTH","I TRIED TO GIVE THIS FIRST TO MY TEETHING BABY BOY WHEN HE WAS 3 MONTHS OLD, HE STARTED TEETHING EARLY, BUT IT WAS SOO HUGE FOR HIS LITTLE MOUTH. SO, I TRIED IT AGAIN AT 6 MONTHS AND STILL NO GO. SO NOW HE CHEWS ON SOPHIE THE GIRAFFE AND LOVES HER. I WILL TRY IT AGAIN WHEN HIS MOUTH IS A LITTLE LARGER."
1,Company Lied about product not being made in China,"Before purchashing this item we called the company and asked where it was made, as we did not what an item made in China in our child's mouth.We were told it was absolutely NOT made in China.The item arrived ... it is made in China.So back it goes. Next time, it would be nice if they were honest."
2,Two big for 3-month-old,"This product is sturdy and looks to be durable. It looks the way it did as pictured.The problem is, my three-month-old had teething symptoms (turned out her pediatrician said she isn't cutting teeth, but experiencing what he called ""pre-teething"" which looks the same and causes some discomfort). Her mouth is too small for most products designed for teething and she doesn't have the motor skills for many of them. This looked to be perfect, since she could use it like her paci.Even though this is labeled as OK for 3 months plus, it's too big for my daughter--she gagged on it repeatedly and spit it out. When I checked, she wasn't just being fussy--the raspberry part was big enough to reach the far back of her mouth and gag her.Looks like this would be a good product for an older child, but if you want something for a very young teether, keep searching!"
2,"Giant 'berry' part! Baby liked, but handle broke..","My baby (who takes no bottles or pacifiers-- though we've tried!) loved this when he was finally able to get it into his mouth. It *is* on the large side and he was only able to 'nibble' at the raspberry part at the very beginning. We put it away for a bit and took it out a few weeks later for him to 'grow into.' We had it for about a month (and he loved chomping on it) before the handle/ring broke in the middle. This was not on a seam, so it shouldn't have been weakened in any way. I didn't have the receipt, so sadly could not return it.In addition, it doesn't stay cold (which I assumed it wouldn't when I first felt the material it was made of).Great idea, but poor actualization of design. I'm hoping for future models that address all our concerns and while still keeping it BPA-free."
2,My teething daughter hates this pacifier.,"The RaZberry Teether is well-made and seems like it would be very satisfying to a teething baby, but unfortunately my daughter spits it out with a look of horror whenever I offer it to her. I've tried for several months now. No luck, and she's not picky about pacifiers or teething toys. She'll suck or chew on everything EXCEPT this. I wouldn't recommend purchasing more than one before you know your child likes it."
3,It's ok,"The light blue one is all one piece of silicon. My 6 month old doesn't love it, and really won't even use it. I'll update it if he takes it up in the next year."
1,"My baby never liked, loved, enjoyed these","I was very excited when I found these. I have 5 kids and with my youngest it looked like a great new possible solution to help during teething. My daughter seriously hated these. I'm not sure if it was the texture, the material used, etc. She just never liked them and I stopped trying to offer them when she started crying just from looking at them O_o At least we tried."
4,Pretty good,"My baby loves to chew on this, she even liked it before she was teething. My only complaint is the thin handle. She got to chewing on that part and actually chewed pieces off, which is potentially a choking hazard."
2,It's just ok,"I bought this item for my 3 month old because she started teething. Despite the fact that the product recommends 3+ months, it was far too large for her mouth. She seems like she would probably be interested if it were smaller. I bought it because her teething rings that she got at the baby shower were all far too large for her to do anything with and this looked a lot more manageable. Not to mention, she loves her pacifiers, so this seemed perfect. I'm very disappointed. I'll probably continue trying it occasionally it hopes that she will grow into it. If she does change her mind I will amend my review."
4,"Very cute, but...","This baby chew toy is very cute and seems like it would be very soothing for itchy gums. My daughter hates pacifiers, so I figured she may not like this, and I was right... she won't hold it or keep it in her mouth longer than a few seconds. However, I still give it 4 stars because when I hold it for her and use it to massage her gums and new teeth, she enjoys it, and it is just such a cute and colorful little thing."
4,Well made,"My 27 mo old, who's working on some molars, found this interesting, but it didn't quite work for him. It does seem really well made and it's really cute, so I'm going to save it for our next baby. I especially liked that it can be boiled to sanitize it."
5,Best teething product there is!,This product is fantastic! It's the perfect consistency for early teethers and late teethers! We have 2 - keep one at home and one in the diaper bag. Couldn't be more satisfied!
2,Too bumpy - My baby spits it out every time!,If your baby already uses a regular pacifier he/she might reject this because it is VERY bumpy/textured. A cute idea but not very useful.
1,Not sure how a teething baby could use this...,"My girl loved a pacifer so we thought this would be great for when she was teething, well, needless to say she is teething and the Razbaby is far, far to big for her mouth. Not sure how this has gotten any good reviews, it seems tremendously large for a 6 month old."
3,Not that cold,This pacifier does not stay cold very long. Our son actually likes to chew on the handle instead of the raspberry.
4,Just About Perfect!,"This has been my baby's favorite teether. I think part of the reason is that she teethed fairly young (started drooling and chewing at 3 months and cut her first four teeth at six months) and this teether was extremely easy for her to hold. The handle is easy to grip and all parts of the toy are extremely chewable, with slightly different textures on different parts. At 8 months old, she still likes to chew on this in the car. I'd give it 5 stars if they had filled it with a gel that could be frozen, but other than that, this is perfect!"
3,Ok,"My daughter played with this more than she used it as a teether. I think the problem was it was too big for her to get in her mouth to chew on, she gagged at times. I think the idea of this is good but it may be better suited to older babies still teething than younger babies."
4,Love this!,I definitely recommend this for little ones who are teething or showing any signs of teething. It allows them to rub something between their gums easily while still having both hands to play!
3,5 month old daughter not interested,My 5 month old daughter showed minimal interest in this teether. She preferred chewing on her bib instead. She often gagged when trying to put the whole thing in her mouth. She probably thought it was a pacifier.
2,Sterilizing,"I loved the idea of this teether. Unfortunately, I am not sure if I should us it. I just got my order from UPS. I sterilized the Raz according to the instructions on the package. I put it in boiling water for 5 minutes. Cooled and inspected. The glue or adhesive that holds the ring part to the raz part melted away and the ring part is breaking off. Very upset. I would have sanitized in the dishwasher, but I was in a hurry to give to my baby. A flimsy product."
2,Too big--triggered gag reflex,My son (5 months old) didn't like this at all. He put it in his mouth like you would a regular pacifier and he gagged. Way too big.
2,Too big for babies mouth!,I bought it and she spits it out over and over. She's teething very bad and refuses this thing because it's huge! it's too round. It's too big for her mouth and she has to form an O shape just to fit it in....which is uncomfortable! This thing should be more flat.
2,Not a great teether,I thought it would be a nice texture for my daughter to chomp on during her teething but she really could care less for it. I think the problem is that the raspberry part is too big/fat and it doesn't fit comfortably in her mouth. She actually chews more on the ring/handle and leaves than she does the actual raspberry! I would not recommend this product to any of my friends!
2,Too big for my baby's mouth.,"I thought maybe this would help my son with teething, but it is too big for his mouth. He isn't able to keep it in his mouth at all."
2,cool teether,"My 4 month old loves the texture of this teether, but it's too big for her mouth. She won't suck on pacifiers. Instead she wants to chew them, so I thought this would be great. It's just too big and she gags.I like the concept though. Maybe when she's a little older."
4,Baby loves this teether,"We were unsure how our LO would receive this - she's pretty picky with what she puts in her mouth (mostly things she shouldn't, rarely teethers or toys).She LOVES the Razberry teether. You can toss it in the fridge to help numb their gums, or just give it to little one as it is.It's a must-have."
2,large and confusing (suck vs chew),"I was really excited about this teether. In my mind it made total sense as a solution to teething babies. Unfortunately to my 4 month old this is not as intuitive. She keeps wanting to suck the teether like a pacifier rather than chew on it for her gums. This usually results in her spitting it out in less than a minute. In addition when she does move it to her gums to chew on, its rather large and heavy so it ends up falling out the side of her mouth unless someone is holding onto it for her. Would not recommend for early teethers or young infants (6 months or under). We'll try again in a few months and see if she likes it any better."
2,It's too big....,"I love the idea of this teether. My 5 1/2 month old son however didn't like the size of it. It is way to big for his mouth. He would chew for a moment then start gagging. He has a soothie pacifier, the raz-berry is about 2 1/2 to 3 time the width of his pacifier."
2,Is this for non nursing babies? Pacifier babies?,"Well, it's a good concept, however my baby never took a bottle or a pacifier and did not like the feel of this teether in her mouth. Maybe it's for babies used to that feeling in their mouths (bottle nipple and pacifier). If your a nursing 100% mom, I dont know if this is the right teether for you. Also, on a good note, you may want to try teething tablets all natural by Hyland's, if your little one is teething badly. They worked wonders for me! You can buy them anywhere. Target, for some reason, keeps them behind the pharmacy counter. Again, they are all natural, no chemicals at all."
2,Bummer...,"Not sure if it is just my baby girl but she wants nothing to do with this teether. It is actually a cool little teether and seems like it would have been a hit with all teething babes but she actually prefers to chew and gnaw on her toys rather than take a binkie or pacifier/teether. I think that if your little one is the same (does not like pacifiers or binkie's) then you might run into the same issue. However, the teether is only a couple of bucks so it may be worth trying."
3,"Ok, but not what I had hoped",My 6 month old is not crazy about this teether. It is rather large. She will chew on it a minute and put it down.
5,Great little teether.,This seems to be one of my sons favorite teething items. It's easy for him to get in and out of his mouth unlike some of the bulky teething toys. I would recommend this to a friend.
3,Ok but not that great,this product was ok but kinda big for my baby girl. Its a great idea but not that great. If you want some thing better for your baby to chew on i recommend The Original Baby Banana Brush.
2,Unfortunate!,"I really wish this would have worked!!! I love the whole concept of the nifty teether....but it just doesn't do the job!! I bought this when she was 4 months and didn't show as much interest anticipated, now @ 7 months is a lost thought ;[ I put the item on her Baby Einstein bouncer as a hanging item, she chewed on it and showed some interest but not as much as other items, that I actually wouldn't assume was better. Very dissapointed in the quality...like others said, looked like it was just glued on ;[ Which it was! Good ole' teethers you put in the freezer from target work better ladies! Don't waste your money ;[ sucks...it was a cute idea though!"
3,Not for my toddler,"My daughter is 14 months and she has been a very late teether. She only started getting teeth a month ago and she hasn't had any interest in teethers but I thought I'd try this one since she will chew on her pacifer. But she has mabye touched this twice, I guess we'll stick with the pacifer. I think this seems like a good product just probably better for younger teethers."
3,Save your money,Baby liked this for a couple of days but I would have been better off saving that money. I bought a lot of unnecessary things though
2,5 month old not using it.,my 5 month old wont use the teether. she prefers her fingers still. maybe it's her age. not sure. it's also way too big for her little mouth. she just doesnt like it.
2,Raz-Berry Teether,my baby was only interested in the product for 1 days. I think the price was a little too high for this product.
2,Didn't like it,"Was just larger than he wanted in his mouth. He liked the color, but never wanted to chew it really. We tried quite alot to get him too, but in the end waste of money. (but for us so were all the teething items, he never used a one, just wanted to chew on straps)"
3,Just okay.,"We bought this along with a teething ring when our son starting cutting his first teeth. His grandmother had given him a Sophie and that is by far his favorite chew toy. He favors the teething ring next and practically ignores the razberry. I would personally recommend Sophie Le Giraffe over the Razberry because it has a bunch of nubs (horns, ears, legs) for the baby to hold onto and chew, it squeaks and our son prefers it best. However, every baby is different with different preferences."
3,Sterilize or not?,i'm not certain whether this should be sterilized like a pacifier or treated as a toy. Instructions did not state. reckon she'll be able to chew on the entire thing (which is what se's attempting to do with her existing ones) and so i got it.
3,teether,"This is a good teether product, but the blue and green one is liked better by my baby. It is softer. This one is a harder plastic, so they are not interchangable. I use it in case we can't find the other. Even though it looks like a pacifier, baby doesn't seem to suck on it, just chew on it...which is good since we are threw with the pacifier."
3,doesn't really like it,my grandson at first liked the raspberry but after the first few seconds wouldn't use it again.
5,Great for chewers,"My 4 month old loves to chew on her RaZ. It's a great combo teether/pacifier. She can grab it on her own and turn it around to chew on different textures. The sucker part is a little big for her mouth, but she will grow into it."
3,Causes my daughter to chew on other pacifiers,"I thought this would be a great idea, because it's shaped like the other pacifiers she likes (MAM) but it's a teether. She never really paid much attention to it until one night when she woke up crying in pain because of her teething. I gave this to her, which helped until her pain went away. Now, however, when I give her the pacifier back, she's chewing on the pacifier! This causes a health hazard as the pacifier is not made for chewing, and her sharp teeth puncture the rubber and pieces can fall off. She's almost 2 and only uses the pacifier to sleep, so we've just thrown away the ones she damages and don't buy more. Soon we won't have to ween her off the pacifier, because we just won't have any more!"
2,not worth it,my daughter does not care for it. she won't even tough it. it is a waste of money and better off getting other teething toys and things that she likes better.
2,DIDN'T SERVE PURPOSE,PURCHASED THIS FOR A 5 MONTH OLD WHO WAS DRULLING A LOT.HE LIKED PUTTING IT IN HIS MOUTH BUT WOULDN'T CHEW ON IT.
1,never got it,I payed for this product and it was not included in the package sent to me! I would like it sent or my money back!
1,"No, no, and no!","With the craze of unnecessary items for children that are over hyped, I decided to purchase one of these for my son when he was younger. Big mistake. He never once enjoyed this device and henceforth, threw it under the couch, and then in the garage. He treated is as if it was extremely uncomfortable for him and he never bit on it at all. The ""berry"" portion of this device is too large for the average infant's mouth.So one begs the question..What is the benefit in this thing?"
4,Good teether,"My son likes this teether. It is a little big for his mouth (he is 6 months old), so it doesn't stay in his mouth for real long periods of time, but he does seem to like it. The larger loop (handle) on the teether is nice for him, too."
3,Just as expected,"This pacifier is just as the picture portrays, my 6 month old is still not sure what to think about the actual bumpy nipple, but she sucks on all the other surfaces and I think once she gives it a chance she will like it. Very soft and chewable!"
5,Teether,The only teether you will ever need. Even if your baby doesnt like pacifiers! love it ! love it! love it!
5,good product,my 4 1/2 month old attacked this soother with a vengeance! He loved chewing it though the actually berry part is quite big so he never got into sucking on it like a pacifier. I'm not sure what the manufacturer means by hands free though. All in all good item to have for the teething child.
4,"Good teether, but rather large!","We first bought this teether for our daughter when she was 4 months old, and it was a bit too large for her to comfortably keep in her mouth. She just spit it back out after a few chews and ignored it. Now that she is 9 months old and her top teeth are coming in, she rediscovered this teether and absolutely loves it! She'll pop it into her mouth and chew happily while she putters around. She's able to keep in the teether indefinitely since her mouth is a little bigger. I'm very glad that we bought it--just wanted to share our size issue with other parents.By the way, if your baby doesn't tend to like pacifiers, I seriously doubt that he will use this much. Our daughter was a bit ambivalent about pacifiers until recently, which probably contributed to her initial disinterest in this one."
4,Big but works,"This ""pacifier"" is large. My daughter took to it immediately. She is five months old and had no problem with it. If your child does well with a pacifier this is the teething item for them. She is able to grab onto it and chew wherever she wants. No hard plastic that hurts to bite on. She is able to put it all in her mouth and does not gag. She usually does not. She usually grabs hold of the side, not the ring and chews where she needs it most. I have seen her chewing just on the tip for her front gums and she moves it to the side of her mouth to chew for her side teeth. Hollow on the back side so don't have to worry about water and saliva staying in the pacifier. Very happy with this purchase."
3,Not as great as I thought it would be...,"This teether is ok, but not as great as I thought. My baby tries to suck on it more like a soother rather then crew like a teether and only gets mad! I feel it sends more mixed signals, but may be a good option for people looking for a way to wean their baby from a soother!"
4,Decent Teether,"Our baby is generally happy. We knew his teething was bothering him so wanted to give this a try based on other reviews. This is ok, maybe it gave him some relief, not sure since he is generally happy. To me, this was just another thing to put in his mouth like all babies do. However, the good things about this is that you can put it in the freezer and it's easy for the baby to handle themselves."
1,Choking hazard,Child was able to bite this teether in half. Luckily the piece was removed before choking. I uploaded the picture.
3,Not the best teether,My son likes this teether but not as much as others. He does not suck on it at all. He just bites it. It is really big for a babies mouth. My son is six months old and is big for his age. He would rather have his Sophie the giraffe teether.
5,Silicon teether,My 6 month old really likes this. At first he wasn't sure if it was a pacifier or not but he quickly caught on and started biting it. And he can easily hold it in his little hand.
4,pretty good teether,"My 6 month old daughter likes this teether. It's not a must have for her so far. It is a nice flexible silicone material. The only downside I see so far is that she likes to shove the round ""handle"" piece in her mouth and has gagged on that a few times. Since the material is soft, she can pretty easily get the handle into her mouth, and get it out quick."
2,TOO BIG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This says 3+ months, but I don't know how any 3 month old fits this in his/her mouth. It's HUGE! My little guy won't be able to get this thing in his mouth for months. I do like the design of it, and he does like gumming on the parts he can get in his mouth, but I have to hold it for him to do that. I was hoping for something he could use largely on his own since his little hands aren't coordinated enough to hold onto other teethers. Sigh. I'm going to keep it for future use, but it's a big disappointment that he can't use it now."
4,Excellent for baby teething in back of mouth,I was searching high and low for a teether that would work for my 6months olds needs. He is constantly trying to find something to chew on in the back of his mouth. Lately he's been using his fingers which I have been trying to discourage because I don't want a thumb sucking habit to start. When I bought this I was a bit skeptical at first but am loving it now. My son is super happy with it and is constantly throwing down his other toys when he notices this item in front of him. I will definitly be getting more as gifts for my friends with children!!
3,Razbaby Raz-berry teether,This item is ok. but it is a little big for the babies mouth. I got this because at almost 4 months old she is chewing on everything. She did not like it cold. she takes and chews on the pacifier without putting the whole thing in her mouth.
3,Good idea but to big for small mouths,We bought this for our daughter hoping it would help her with teething...unfortunately the Razberry is to big for her mouth. I think its a good idea overall but not for babies with small mouths
4,Great Teether,"I bought this for my daughter when she had first signs of teething (around 5 months). Though she likes a pacifier for sleeping, she HATED this teether and it jsut seemed way too big for her mouth.At 7 months we reintroduced this teether and now she LOVES it. She doesn't suck on it like a regular pacifier, but chews on the leaves, the ring, rubs the berry against her gums. It isn't something she will want for bedtime, but it is a toy that will distract her from teething pain and offer much enjoyment like a toy when playing or in the car."
3,Raz not the best for small teething babies,"I purchased this teether in the hopes that my four month old who is actively teething would take some of her finger gnawing in a different direction. The RaZ-Berry silicone teether is great in that it has 3 different textures, all chew-onable. It's not so great in the sense that the actual raspberry part is similar to a pacifier and if a baby wants to suck, it's more likely going to gag because of the size of the red part. My daughter is still trying to figure this thing out."
3,"Weird, but good","My daughter has a hard time not sucking on this like a pacifier and then the texture freaks her out so she spits it out. If I hold it for her she likes to really chew on it, but she cannot hold it for herself yet."
3,"Well, mommy likes it","My baby only just cut his bottom two teeth and so far he is not that into this product, although he chews on everything else. I'm hoping he will be more into it as he gets more teeth. I think it confuses him because he tries to suck on it like a pacifier, but he can't."
2,baby item,my grandson is not into this at all....but it's cute and he may enjoy it later on but for this first stage of teething it's just not for him.
1,teether came apart,"I absolutely love the idea of this teether which is why I bought it. Unfortunately, the raspberry part (which seemed like it was just glued) came apart from the rest of the binky which posed a huge chocking hazard. This scared me since I usually leave teethers in my child's crib where I am not constantly supervising. I would not recommend this product. I feel a lot more confident in the teether binky from ""Soothie"" that is all one piece. It's unfortunate because it looks like it would be a fantastic product if only it was constructed safer..."
2,Not good for very young teethers who use pacifiers normally,"Be warned if you are buying this for an early teething baby. I bought this in advance for my little one, thinking that it would be a couple months until he needed it. Whoops, he started teething just this past week at 3 1/2 months. I got this out and he doesn't know what to make of it. It's too large for his mouth. He is used to a pacifier and tries to suck on the RaZberry. Then he spits it out or it falls out. Although he is able to grasp & hold a rattle and throw it around, he doesn't have the manual dexterity necessary to help hold the RaZberry teether in his mouth for it to work. We try to hold it up for him, but his little tongue pushes it out. Right now what is working are plain old teething rings directly from the freezer. We help him hold on to those and he'll chomp on them for some time."
2,Unsafe and unhygenic,"The teether (made in china) came out of the pack with a bad smell. The material used for construction seems to be unhygenic. Raspberry part is glued to the teether base. My doubts are that it can come off easily. The raspberry part was itself marked with black dots which i first thought are part of the design but when i rubbed them with my thumb... they vanished.Design is very good and practical but construction (raspberry glued, black dots) and material used is worse."
5,Favorite Teether,I bought this teether for my baby when he was 6 months old. It's so easy for him to hold and he likes chewing on all parts of it. He always has it at night before bed when I read him books. It keeps his hands and mouth occupied while he listens to stories. I also bough Sophie the Giraffe teether which he loves as well.
1,"Was going to buy, but ""Made in China"" Stopped me.","I was going to buy this item, but after seeing that it was ""Made in China"" I decided not to. The fact is that with the China having added LEAD and many other toxins to kids toys, I don't trust them to have a safe product and having my baby suck/chew on it for long times is scary. How I wish that it were made in Germany or any other place other than China...I would pay more for it in a heart beat! Here is an idea, how about having it ""MADE IN THE USA!"" ? Sad choice for these ladies to do that."
1,REJECTED,Like everyone else I am constantly trying to soothe my sons teething pain and find him whatever toys will help. This one was too big for his mouth and almost seemed to gag him once he got it in. I'm glad it wasn't very expensive.
4,Love this teether!!,"We love the RaZberry teether from RaZbaby! I bought one for my 4-month old son and it is the only teething toy he will use -- everything else we tried with him bombed (including the wet washcloth). I gave it 4/5 stars only because the ""raspberry"" is a little big for his mouth. I am confident he will quickly grow into it though. I am also VERY happy that it is BPA-, phthalate- and PVC-free. Bonus: It can safely be sterilized by boiling or running through a microwave bottle sterilizer. Great product!"
3,great idea!,This is a great idea unfortunately my daughter (6 months) doesn't really get the concept yet... She keeps pulling it out to chew on the green part. We are going to keep trying...
3,It's ok,My three month old son is not keen on pacifiers. This one is no different. He'll take it on occassion but instead of using it to soothe his teething pain he marvels at the fact that he can grip it w/ his fingers. It's a short lived distraction from the teething pain at best.
4,THIS IS A RE-RELEASE!!!,DONT GET FOOLED!!!..this cd is a re-release of an import cd called Encounters.It has been re-named and is on a different label. Why do they do this !!!...if you are going to release it domestically at least give it the same name!!!
4,mighty fine record,"You need to pick this record up. It's sick. Drenched in dub and hip-hop there are some killer tracks on here especially the Thievery Corporation remix of ""Can I Get A Witness"" worth the cost of the CD alone."
2,Love them even though they hurt me!,"I love the details on the boots - from the zipper pulls to the toe plates they are very cool! However, they run big in the foot area, so I slide around in them, but then they are tall and tight in the ankle area, which makes them very uncomfortable. Because they are so stiff and tight, they are painful after even just walking to the ladies room once or twice. Unfortunately you can't adjust the fit because they have zippers rather than being lace ups. Even if I loosen the ties and leave the zippers down part way, they still hurt. I'm hoping that they will loosen up in time. Meanwhile, I put up with it because they are hot looking but in the future I will only wear them on rides and to sit. NO WALKING!"
1,Not for me,"The shoe does not run true to size. You probably want to get a half size larger, if possible."
3,Padding makes these narrower than rated,"I got a pair of these. They'r beautiful and comfortable. There's perhaps a little too much padding in the sides, but probably good in colder climates.I usually wear 14W (14E) but these bulged out too far when I put them on. From and including the ball of the foot to the toe it pinches in too much on the sides.Length was exactly as ordered.Arch support was meagre, but it was better than being barefoot."
3,"Soft, warm, a little narrow","I got a pair of these. They'r beautiful and comfortable. There's perhaps a little too much padding in the sides, but probably good in colder climates.I usually wear 14W (14E) but these bulged out too far when I put them on. From and including the ball of the foot to the toe it pinches in too much on the sides.Length was exactly as ordered.Arch support was meagre, but it was better than being barefoot."
2,Poor Pictures,"The book has some valuable information, but the pictures are very poor in quality.It does not provide information about how to build the pieces, and the plans have no details of the joints."
3,Shaker furniture,"Useful in some ways, but not for the project I had in mind. I made a Welsh style dresser, but used info from the book to panel the doors and sides, dowelled the Mortice and tenon joints on the doors, and bought Shaker style door knobs from the USA. I left the shelves open ,as this is more the style in the UK, also did not have the time. Regulations in the UK state that any glass used in doors must be toughened, which is too expensive for this project.The item was very well received by my youngest daughter in her new kitchen"
5,Dudley....................,".........NO longer ""with us""..............Brilliantly put ""his BEST Piano Compositions"" on THIS CD.It is Wonderful; a ""pure delight"" To LISTEN To."
5,Introducing a new field in style,"This is the first introductory textbook on the emerging field of developmental cognitive neuroscience, and one that sets high standards. Professor Johnson provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the essential mechanisms of the development of brain, behavior and cognition. Developmental cognitive neuroscience is a relatively new field of research, and Johnson has been one of its pioneers. The book deals not only with research on human infant development, but also deals with early learning and development in animals. This book is required reading for advanced undergraduates and postgraduates, and it is an excellent guide for researchers and teachers in this field. I will certainly want to use it for courses in developmental cognitive neuroscience."
5,review on developmental cognitie neuroscience,nice book with clear introdution about the theories and reseach findings on the development of neurological systems and it relation with the development of other aspects.
3,don't buy this,the discs are scratched and damaged and don't play well. There is definitely something wrong with quality control at emphasisentertainment. I contacted the manufacturer through their website and they acknowledged the fault and they were so kind to send replacement discs. 2 replacement discs were dvd-r but it is better than nothing...
5,Great product,"Excellent historical account of IH Cub tractors. If you are a collector or enthusiast, this is a valuable and interesting book."
2,Disappointed,"Despite the description given on the Amazon web site, this book contained only a brief mention of the original Farmall Cub and implements."
1,Died in less than 2 years,"This bark collar worked moderately well for the first year before it broke. It definitely was not easy to get on the dog, however -- that part was always a struggle. Then it just stopped working altogether, right after the 1 yr warranty expired, of course. Petsafe will provide service, but at the same cost as buying a new one. Thanks, but no thanks. I'll be buying from a different manufacturer this go around."
5,To clarify,"There seems to be missing/conflicting information about this (and other sizes of M-D Building Products brand) foam tape. Some say that it's double sided, some say it's single sided. The roll I got has wax strips on both sides, but it only has adhesive on one side."
3,Horrible Buy!,"The product arrived as advertised, except for the fact that the battery, which was included did not work. After buying a new battery, the unit worked fine. The scale is quite light and is not very well built. It has a lot of rattles and it is very touchy. It's just okay. Okay, after months of frustration, I have thrown this piece of junk away. If I could change my rating, It would be a 1 star. Do not buy this scale."
3,Jury still out,"The product description states that this scale ""Requires 4 1.5V AA batteries"" but it came with a dead 3V lithium battery. Since I have not been out to look for a replacement battery yet, I have not actually used this scale. It definitely is light weight--so much so that it seems insubstantial to me. Made in China."
5,I like it a lot,"I've had this model of shredder for about 4-5 years. I like it because it is small and does not take up too much space in my home office. I also like the way it looks. Granted, if you stuff 4 pages in it at once, like the other reviewer did, you WILL have a problem. I don't care what is advertised - if you want your unit to last, put only one page in at a time. If you cannot tolerate shredding one sheet at a time, this product is not for you. If you can, expect to keep and use this shredder for several years before it needs to be replaced. I've had two, each lasting about 2+ years. I am now buying my third unit.... Eventually it does slow down even after careful use. But for this price, and for the nice size which does not disrupt and create more clutter, I find that to be a good trade off."
4,history and culture,"Livermore's collection of essays is now over 50 years old. Yet to those interested in Portugal or Brazil, much still remains a good read. The authors discuss the history and culture of both countries. Entwhistle talks about the differences in language between the two, for example. Brazilian Portuguese differs not just in accent from that spoken in Portugal, but also in many new words. Here, a contemporary reader should also pursue more recent books on linguistic differences. As undoubtedly much new has arisen since 1953.Other parts of the book relate to the histories of these countries. Looking at centuries past. Portugal built a vast colonial empire, and Brazil was its shining star. The accounts are well done. Especially since the British writers in this book wrote as the British Empire was being dismantled. From their vantage, the Portuguese colonies would inevitably gain independence. Though it would take some 20 years after the book was written for all this to come about."
2,Easy does it...,"I recently purchased a 1997 Expedition, but couldn't find the owners manual. I ordered this book with hopes of clarifying some basic information. I think this book has quite a bit of data, but it is hard to read, index, and otherwise unfriendly. For example, the fuse box section does not tell you which fuses relate to which piece of equipment, making troubleshooting tough. The section on sizes and capacities is so small and marked with footnotes, I still don't know what size fuel tank I have. Also, too many models covered in this manual that aren't important to me, and too few pictures. I'm gonna try the Haynes version."
1,Limited Electrical,"The book barely mentioned the trip/mileage computer much less what to do to troubleshoot, remove and replace or what else might cause a blank screen. I was very disappointed that even the wiring diagrams showed nothing concerning this unit. Also to try and track down the circuit involved the book gave no help on basics such as the fuses involved."
4,Brief Therapy,"Not as useful as I had hoped, although it does have some specific diagnositc case examples. It is a UK publication and practice is different than in US"
5,Good Earth,Item came as described in just a few days. can be hard to find but worth the search. lights are great and cannot be seen under cabinets.
2,discription a little misleading,The Amazon description led me to believe that there would be a lot of scenery of Ireland accompanied by Phil Coulter's music. Instead the DVD was predominantly views of the live performance with only a relatively small portion of scenes of Ireland. While the music is indeed beautiful my personal preference was to see a lot more of the scenery. In my opinion the description was misleading.
3,Phil Coulter live,"A little disappointing due to the quality of the DVD. It is worth the price, just to see Phil do ""The Town I Loved so Well,"" but I would prefer better video."
3,It's Alright,"I was more Hyped about this cut back in the day far more.basic Pop cut.but back in the day this was Prince's first B-Side&back then this was a Big deal.it was the B-Side to ""Let's Work"".I use to Rock it back then.the song is Alright to me not the same but it was cool back then."
1,Cumbersome,"We purchased this item after having the Gulpy water bottles. Why we changed brands I will never know! This product is very difficult to use, it takes several steps to get the water into the tray and is a cumbersome process. We returned the product after using it one time and ordered new Gulpys."
1,Not spillproof!,"I got this so I wouldn't have to carry a separate bowl when taking my dog out on hot summer days. However, it leaks all over the place. Additionally, I don't use it as intended (as shown in the photo) because the water comes out at such a slow trickle. I just unscrew the top and pour water directly into the bowl portion. I ended up super gluing the little slits in the top of the bottle closed so water would stop leaking out of it, since I don't use it as a dispenser anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would not buy this. I would just buy a sturdy collapsible bowl to carry around (Ruffwear makes good ones) in addition to a water bottle. It would only take up a little more space, would hold more water, and wouldn't leak!"
1,Disappointed,"I was under the impression that the Handi-Drink was one piece, but it is not. The bottle has to be removed and filled then snapped into place and secured. To use, you need to flip the bottle up, struggle to maintain it in place and squeeze water into the tray. My Toy Poodle, Betty, managed to drink from the tray while we were in a moving car, but I had to pour the portion she didn't drink back into the bottle. The worst part of this not-so-clever gadget is that IT DOES LEAK!!"
5,Handy water supply at the dog park.,"Easy to carry with the belt loop clip, and my dog has a drink available when she needs it. Great idea."
3,Water Bottle for dogs,it's okay but the water just don't come out very well.it keeps the water in great but not for it to come.
2,Trouble with Bottle,"The dish is a good idea, but the bottle did not empty water easily into the the dish. I ended up pouring my own water into dish."
3,"Works, kinda","This does do what it needs to do but not how it's supposed to do it. I took our pooch for a walk after I got this, excited to try it out. Disappointing. The bottle screws into the tray and in the tray there is a ""cap"" with an ""X"" cut into it for the water to squirt through when you squeeze the bottle - except mine won't work like that. I've tried cutting the X bigger, squeezing harder, nothing. It still works though. Instead of squeezing the water into the tray, I just unscrew the bottle and pour it into the tray that way. Honestly it's probably quicker than squeezing it in anyway. So while it doesn't work as intended, it does work well enough that I can walk the dog on warm days knowing that she will have cool water to drink - which she definitely appreciates!"
1,anti-handy water bottle,"Well, I think this is a very bad design. I have had the GULPY water bottle before and when I break them, I need to order more. I happened upon this one and wasn't paying attention to the brand. When I received my 3 new handi-drink bottles, I was very disappointed. Only to be even more disappointed once I took one of bottles with me for a hike. Here are the flaws. #1 bottle is smaller (read, holds less water) and the dish is square so it takes up more room in the fanny pack. #2 the slits are way too small to actually get water out of the bottle, I altered it to get a somewhat steady flow (although it took a while to get the stream to come out the center and not shoot out to one side). When it is in the fanny pack while walking, the bouncing of walking sloshes the water out of the container and down my butt and leg. #3 There isn't much water left for the dog to drink #4 the plastic is very cheap #5 need I say more.I will go back to the GULPY now.Sincerely, sad pooch :("
1,"Great idea, bad execution","This dog water bottle is not very convenient AT ALL. First of all, it's definitely not spill-proof. Even when the bottle is closed, it leaks if it goes upside down or falls over in the bag you're carrying it in. Also, there is really no way for the water to get back into the bottle if the dog doesn't drink it all. This isn't a problem if you're outside but I am using it with my service dog and there isn't always a place to pour out leftover water. And then if you do manage to get rid of the water, or your dog drinks it all, you have to find a way to dry the thing off otherwise when you close it there's going to be water/spit all over the bottle. Dislike. :("
4,Nice water bottle,"Very well made. The snap to pour is not easy or efficient. Nice size, holds plenty of water."
4,Fast Delievery,It was not like the one I saw at the park but was very close and works just as well. If you have a large dog better carry an extra bottle of water. Costal Pet was johnny-on-the-spot as I ordered it on Fri and received it on Mon.
1,promo item,The one I got will function as described the major issue I have is that it has Golds gym stamped on it making it look like a cheap promo given away by a gym it even came with a golds gym headband stuffed in the bottle that is in the trash and I am using a sharpie to cover the logo stamped on the bowl. I hate paying for something to promote a company that I don't like. If I had seen it in the ad I would have bought a different one from another vendor I will not buy from this vendor again.
1,leaking bottle,"The bottle leaks water and if you put it in your bag it will be soaked. Since it is very cheap, it is not worth dealing with returns"
3,dog water bottle,"it is a good, practical product. It helps a lot for walks in the park. its only falt is that is leaks a bit from the top, thus you cannot just drop it into your bag, you have to have it upright. This might prove to be an inconvenience."
1,Hassle,"This water bottle holds only a small amount of water and is a hassle to use. The bottle must be positioned perfectly so that it will dispense water, and if you manage to do this the water only trickles out. On the rare occasion that I use this product I just unscrew the cap and fill the tray. I do not recommend this product."
4,Happy Dog Owner,I really like this product. I take my dog Max a Jack Russell with me almost everywhere. Its especially handy when he goes boating with us.
1,Poorly constructed,Great idea but poorly constructed. The fastener broke off on the first use and could not be repaired. A heavy rubber band is an adequate replacement but aggravating.
2,No spill? No way -- leaks all the time and other products are better ...,"My two dogs had three puppies, so I bought four different products from four different manufacturers, in order to compare them and then buy the bottles that work best. This was two years ago. Two products haven't survived for very long, because of their idiotic concept or their choice of materials, such as a soft plastic that dogs seem to prefer to chew on rather than drink out.This product is still there, but from the very beginning, the ""no spill"" claim was a joke. In fact, it leaks all the time! Moreover, while it doesn't require brain surgery to assemble/disassemble the two parts for each use, there are other products that do not require such an unnecessary step.That product would be the ""Gulpy"" -- more expensive, but if you plan on using these bottles frequently, a better deal in the end."
1,drippy water bottle for dogs,terrible designed leaked water everywhere by the time we needed to give the dog water it had leaked inside his day pack and had no water i dont recommend this productsorry M.Malone
2,Read this book during pregnancy,This book is helpful if you read it in the beginning of pregnancy. It does a lot of cheerleading for you to get the most out of your employer for maternity leave but lacks specific instructions or advice. I was looking for ways to get the most out of the maternity leave I was already on and the book did not fit my needs.
1,worst piece of garbage disaster of a movie,"forget the 3d, a mentally challenged child could do a better job. such a waste of time. it is unwatchable"
2,Amateur Porn Star Killer - The Trilogy in 3D,One DVD was damaged. Picture was very grainy with vertical lines and not viewable at times. The 3D on disk 2 was very poor.
1,Bad DVD the 3D IS A JOKE,"the DVD is bad, the thing is suppost to be 3D what a joke !!! Not a good DVD I hate it!!"
2,Remastered from Original Negatives???WTF??,"I totally agree with the last reviewer's opinion. Remastered...my butt! The only reason I give it 2 stars is 1 -the price is cheap, and 2 -it may be the only U.S release for the first film The Pleasure Garden.The Pleasure Garden (with it's redone titles) and Easy Virtue look the same as the best available DVDs out there, which is pretty dismal. The Farmer's Wife is cropped badly, and the print is horrid. This film is available in France from Studio Canal in a great print on a box set.Yeah, and that f******g Screen Gems logo in the top right corner throughout all 3 titles is unacceptable, ignorant and insulting."
1,Yoga DVD,I returned it. There is little about yoga in this DVD. It is more like a quick passed strech excercise routine with sounds of elephants and other animals.
2,not that great,"It has some good idea for entertaining kids while doing yoga, but some things are too advanced for kids (or a beginner like me) without more explanation than is provided. It was annoying to me that the instructions were all voiced-over."
2,More like a fast paced workout,"This video has very little to do with yoga. If you and your family are already in good shape and very familiar with yoga poses, it can take you through a VERY fast paced series of poses with annoying music. But there is nothing relaxing about it! I could barely get into the pose for a second before she had moved on to something totally different. Many of the moves are basic enough, but others ask for quite a bit of balance with no warning and no alternate moves for beginners. Definitely not something my four year old and I could do together for fun."
5,Perfect for my family,"My children, ages 3,4,and 6 are excited to do yoga with This DVD. They really enjoy the poses, stretching, breathing, and partner exercises. The movie is simple and easy to understand."
5,Love it!!,"I love this video! If you are looking for something that is very technical and step by step--this is not it. Yoga For Families is structured, but still very free flowing and focuses on the most important aspect: time with your family. In my opinion doing yoga with children is about building a healthy foundation of exercise, meditation, and a positive outlook on life, not so much mastering each pose. Ingrid is very chill and enjoyable to watch. I highly recommend this video!"
3,rev,a little disappointed in this dvd. din't give a lot ideas for teaching yoga to families. wasn't a total waste of time though--got a few good poses from it.
5,Awesome!,"Ingrid is a yoga star! She truly shines that sweet starry light into your yoga class experience. The sequences are fun, energizing and calming. Ingrid has included a great selection of sequences so you can tailor your practice to the specific needs of the day. I love the scenery, the colors and the fun feeling I get when I turn on the DVD. When I practice with Ingrid's DVD, I feel like I have gifted myself a great yoga retreat! It's perfect for a pretend family vacation. Truly takes the stress away. Thanks Ingrid!"
3,A little more advanced than I wanted,"Although not a bad yoga dvd, I was looking for something to do with my younger children, ages 3 and 5. You can tell that the voice over instructions and sound effects were added to make this video appeal to a younger audience, but it was still too challenging for younger kids and did not hold their attention."
5,Wonderful!!!,This dvd is wonderful!!! I'm a full-time working Mom with not enough time to exercise. This is an amazing dvd! Now I can finally workout while also having family time....it benefits everyone! My 6 year old daughter loves this dvd and looks forward to our yoga sessions together! It is entertaining as well as a great workout! A wonderful way to connect as a family!A must-have!!!
5,EXCELLENT,"I did not actually buy this--I am saving up since it is kind of expensive. But I did get a sample of it and was able to wear it for a day. And this stuff is THE best smelling perfume I have ever smelled in my life. It smells so good that I will not even feel guilty buying it when I do. (Unless I get it as a gift, which will be even better.)I highly recommend this perfume."
2,too expensive,"Works fine in our Canon machines. Easy to install. Only problem is the exorbitant price. $135 list price ??? Try getting a new cartridge from the Amazon Marketplace. Or perhaps look for 3rd party manufacturers, that are compatible with Canon copiers."
1,"Too basic, no meat!","This book is below the basic need of any Loss Prevention Professional, and most business owners. The author fills space with meaningless things such as how to describe a suspect, numbers for government agencies.......Don't waste your time and money!"
3,Girls and (guys?) oh my...,"Length:: 0:37 MinsThe Kao Yung & Kuan-Liang portfolio is full of a lot of nice images. I was however, as another reviewer said, 'decieved' by the cover into thinking that most of the pictures would be of women. Not true. It's actually more 'pretty' boys than women. It's kind of a surprise being that both of the artist are male. Hey what ever, who am I to judge? I guess I should have checked their art out online somewhere before I bought it. Also for some reason the book I recieved has a black and white cover not a colored one shown in the products picture (see video). Well this is a book just as much for the ladies as it is for the men. It's just not my cup of tea.Now some specs.Pages 1 through 64 are all in full color.Pages 65 through 80 is a section of rough sketches.Page 81 is dedicated to a profile of both artist."
2,Entertaining but not worth the cost,"This video should be priced around $5.50 because you'll want to watch it twice, then let it collect dust. I agree with another reviewer - shoddy production. The video production is novice at best. I don't understand the other 5 star reviews to be quite honest. Also, the actor's voices are annoying. I will look for another baseball video for my toddler."
4,The Breckers' Reunite!,"Just as the title implies, this was a reunion album of sorts for The Brecker Brothers as both the late Michael and Randy had been working on their own individual projects for a decade or so before they reunited for this one. The program consists of mostly original tunes, including a somewhat comical vocal from Randy on ""That's All There Is To It."" The disc has recently been reissued, and I would recommend it to fans of The Breckers or the jazz fusion genre."
5,Fabulous!,"The same talent and energy of the old Brecker Brothers, but a whole new ""thang."" Outstanding composing, excellent improvisation, tight ensemble and great energy. This is one of my favorites. (I also recommend ""Out of the Loop"" - another outstanding recording from the Bros - won a Grammy the year to came out and for good cause!)"
3,THE GREATEST JAZZIST,"I LIKE JAZZ AND I HEARD TO RANDY BRECKER IN MEXICO, RECENTLY IN MEXICO CITY AND I THINK THAT THEM MUSIC IS STILL FRESH AN QUITE GOOD, FOR THIS REASONS I'M BUYING ALL THE CD'S OF THE BRECKER BROTHERS AS IT'S POSSIBLE FOR ME. I'D LIKE TO RECIVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM.THANKS & CONGRATULATIONS.R. ROMERO"
4,Brecker Brothers Vs Hip-Hop. NOOOOOOOOO,"Take away the hip-hop, the samples (it's LAZY music, man) and Randy's bad singing (why does he do it - I hope it's meant as a bit of fun, but I fear otherwise; listen to some of his solo albums) this is a full-on high-octane, high-range, rubber-burning horn set that defined their sound over a decade earlier. It's tinged with the nineties' sound of world-music synth rhythms, which is not a criticism (I particularly like 'Wakaria' with it's quirky rhythms and tribal chant tip). I'm not a lover of Hip-hop, and would take sampled music and strap it to a large explosive device if only someone would ask; however, this is definately the Return of the Brecker Brothers. Welcome back boys, it's been a long time."
3,"A Good Mid-range ""Transition"" Knife","I purchased this knife on sale on a whim. I thought it looked pretty and I knew that Calphalon was a pretty good brand in cookware, but didn't know much about its reputation in knives.I'm a kitchen nerd, but have limited resources to spend on great equipment. As a result, this knife is the ""best"" one in my pitiful collection. It's certainly very nice to hold, it looks pretty, and it keeps an edge well, BUT! I would not pay full price for this knife. In comparison to the ""better"" brands, this knife doesn't really hold up, and it's only really a good value if you're not paying full price for it.In short, if you're still holding off on buying your ""real"" knives, this is a pretty good one to have in the meantime, if you find it on sale."
3,Basic Background,This basic overview cites assorted cities and towns in Rajasthan and the Muslim influences that shape this corner of Northern India.
2,disappointed,"I received these earrings in the mail today and am having to return them already. They are nice earrings but I opened the box and one of the posts was broken off. To say the least I was very disappointed I love this style of earring and wear them all the time so I thought I would get sterling silver to wear and not worry about them turning green or hurting my ear, like the cheap ones you buy at other stores, but at least they don't fall apart before you even get to wear them"
4,David Starkey is Amazing,David Starkey always does a wonderful job in bringing history to life. This DVD is a must have if you enjoy history along with a DVD of Elizabeth I also by David Starkey.
5,A Great Historical Account,"For those who enjoyed the documentary that aired in July 2003 on PBS and couldn't find the DVD to buy, this is it! This is the entire program with David Starkey as the narrator. A very good account with live actors intermixed with historical locations and portraits. My only criticism is that the costumes (particularly the headpieces) tend to be a lot more lavish than what they would have been and equal time should have been spent on the last four wives. The time is allocated more on the number of years they played a role in Henry's life, so the first DVD is comprised of Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, the second with Jane/Anne/Katherine/Catherine. All in all, Henry VIII fans will not be disappointed."
1,Very Disappointed,"This was a gift for my wife who loves Tudor history. But it turned out to be a bad choice. Not only was this an amateur production, but the picture seemed stretched vertically. Everything appeared elongated and narrow, making it difficult to watch."
4,Good Quality of Poetry,"Don't let the title fool you. This book is not some sleazy paperback novel. Some of the most beautiful poetry from poets such as Byron can be found within its pages. The excerpt from ""Don Juan"" by Byron is just so right for the book. The one downside of this book is that it does contain some graphic limmericks and a rather rauchy poem. Other than that, this book is worth the read."
2,Review of Stagecoach,"I felt the acting in the original Stagecoach was much better. In the new version the actors were not beliviable, more like a first time acting role.I would not recommend buy it."
2,This is junk!,"I dont understand why this lame version of a great movie is on DvD when the 1966 version, which is MUCH better, is not! IMHO, the 1966 version is as good as the original 1939 release so why is this junky version available on video when the '66 version is not?"
3,STAGECOACH,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL JOHHNY CASH AND WILLIE NELSON MADE IT WATCHABLE.ITS OKAY ITS OKAY ITS OKAY.ITS OKAY.
5,a western,we love westerns and this was not top of the line but has some great actors in it and it is a good movie.
3,a surprise..and a seredipity,"I bought this to see the last film appearance of Lash LaRue...very short scene and about 2 lines. But, still Lash has that way about him. The movie itself was pretty good...surprise.The Kris/Willie/Waylon/Johnny crew made an album where they all dressed in black and featured the original Man in Black, Lash LaRue , on a great , back of the album picture."
5,AMAZING!,This CD is definetly one of the best CD's that I own. Dallas Green has an amazing voice which fits very well with the style of music. Every song on this album brings you through a lot of different emotions. GO BUY THIS CD!!!
4,Solid Disc,I bought this album on a whim after hearing the second track. After listening to it a few times now I can safely say that I love it! Think John Mayer or Jack Johnson but better. The songs are all mainly acoustic but the melodies are gorgeous. I give 4 stars simply because I like to save the 5 star ratings for my favorite 10-20 albums. Do yourself a favor: purchase!
4,Booster Seat,The seat we ordered is what we expected and of good quality. We are happy with this purchase. Highly recommended.
4,So far so good :-),Upon arrival the puppy wouldn't wind up...we had to push the key in fairly hard to get it to catch so it would wind. There was no instructions so I'm not sure if that was a fluke or if that's how it's sent. As soon as my daughter gets up we'll see how she likes it :-) She loves puppies and this is being used as a replacement for her musical bunny that her brothers broke. Hopefully it has the same affect.
3,good but not like the second book,"I bought this book because I read the ""Circle of Seven"" and expected a similar thrill. The book was good, but not as suspenseful as the other one. I didn't really know what the Lasko Interview was about until the middle of the book. There were a lot of pages dedicated to sharing the gospel as well."
5,Christian Fiction with sound Biblical teaching!,"Clay has done an excellent job in writing this suspense novel and has included some strong teaching for the average ""church-goer"" today. This book will challenge your thinking about just attending church or truly entering into the worship of our God and actively living for Him. If you're not afraid to be challenged beyond your comfort zone, this is a must read. You won't be disappointed."
2,Didn't have as much to offer as I thought,"I looked forward to solid information in this book that wouldn't easily be found elsewhere, but the writer repeats some of the points he's already made rather than going further into the lives of these composers. In general, the information is less substantive than I thought I might find."
2,My least favorite of Dave Weckl's solo work,"I agree with ""Ian Case"", this is not Weckl's best work at all. I was really pretty disappointed with this album as a whole. The tunes have no ""oomph"", no drive or passion to them. There's a lot of very cheesey synth work throughout the album. Yes, the drumming is very technical and flawless...but lacks heart. This is one to add if you're simply looking to complete a collection...but not one that will get worn out from being played too much!"
1,Revisionist nonsense,"The book is nonsense. If it was truly accepted as a doctoral dissertation, the University on Nantes has lowered its standing as an academy valuing truth. Interested readers are directed to Saul Friedlander's biography: Kurt Gerstein: The Ambiguity of Good (apparently OUP and not available from Amazon). Gerstein's account has been affirmed by, among others, some of the people who were there and were later tried (see Gitta Sereny's Into That Darkness for interviews with Franz Stangl and others). Finally, Yitzhak Arad's Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps gives a definitive look at these institutions."
1,False and broad assumptoins prevented writer from degree,"Seriously, this is part of a political not educational-oriented movement. Noontide Press, Institute of Historical Review, Henri Roques, & David Irving are among a small group of ""revisionists"" that try to give the impression that they know what they are talking about. Anyone that knows anything about history no longer respects any of their opinions as anything but distortions of reality. PLEASE PASS ON THE POLITICAL PROPAGANDA PACKAGED AS AN EDUCATIONAL THESIS."
4,A few songs you should not be without.,"I realize this is one of the Grateful Dead's weak releases. However, the profundity and beauty of ""Standing On the Moon,"" and ""Built to Last"" make this album worth while; it would have made a great EP. The two aforementioned songs are two of my favorites. If you choose not to buy this album then do yourself a favor and get these few brilliant tracks somewhere. Cheers."
2,Greatest Gift of All,"With ""Built to Last,"" the Grateful Dead give their fans the ultimate gift. . . . an album so mediocre that even the most enthusiastic fan would be thankful that there would be no more to come. This is the Dead's final trip to the studio. Had they called it a day after ""In the Dark,"" many may have been left wondering what would have followed. Now that the Dead had a certified hit record, how would they follow it up? Rather than leave fans imagining great albums of the future (not that ""In the Dark"" was any masterpiece, in my opinion), they deliver ""Built to Last,"" demonstrating that the long, strange trip was over indeed."
2,Not For The Casual Fan,"BUILT TO LAST is the Grateful Dead's last album and they finish their recording career with a pretty boring album. The song, ""Foolish Heart,"" got most of the radio attention and is the most often included song in their concert repetoire. However, that song alone is not worth the price of the album. There are plenty of other great Grateful Dead albums, AMERICAN BEAUTY, WORKINGMAN'S DEAD, MARS HOTEL, and IN THE DARK plus a number of fine live albums are much better choices.This album is for completists and Deadheads only and for them, it will take up shelf space more than ever becoming a staple in the CD player."
1,Wasn't this product discontinued by Microsoft?,"I seem to have made the mistake of purchasing this product just before the product was discontinued by microsoft. Isn't this the case? and if so, why is the product still being sold by Amazon?"
2,Shallow and pedantic,"This is not the best book about public harassment. Gardner focuses too much on categorizing the various forms of harassment out there, and it just becomes a long-winded piece about that. It forgets all the other nuances of public harassment, and there is no focus on the dispositions that cause men to infringe on womens' rights to be left alone. It has a very static narrative that leaves one's eyes to glaze over after a few minutes. Moreover, most of the testimonies is set in Indianapolis, which is honestly not the best place to study harassment. It is a commuter city, and women who live here do not experience the same kind of intense harassment, since they can just drive back and forth--unlike cities like New York or Washington D.C. where the urban experience does not allow you to actually escape harassment.This book was just not enjoyable or enlightening."
2,How did this not work for me?,"The checklist of descriptors for this book has all gold stars. Everything I typically enjoy is contained in this Young-Adult-Fantasy-Set-in-1900s-Britain-featuring-Precocious-Youngsters (I will read anything in that well-endowed genre). Oh, I didn't realize that this was by the author of 'The Owl Service' - another title that should have hit my marks (that one sounded even better than this one)... Anyway, I didn't care for it, in spite of my positive-prejudice. Nothing much to say, I just don't think it was very well written. There are many titles in this genre to which to next turn. Have at them instead."
4,"compelling ""clash of worlds"" fantasy for older kids","I fell in love with Garner's Alderley Edge books about the same time as I did with ""Lord of the Rings"", at the age of 8 or 9. The lifting from Norse myth is still there, although more subtle. Celtic and later mediaeval accretions (the sleeping knights) are mixed in, along with some beautiful original creations (laclacs!). The idea of fantastic beings and doings coexisting covertly with everyday life in rural Cheshire is well handled. NB - the Legend, and virtually every nook and cranny on the Edge that is mentioned, are all quite real, and it can be an eerie experience visiting the place after reading this book. My only cavil is that the pace is judged just right for the intended readership :-) Re-reading as an adult, I found the final few chapters a bit rushed and superficial."
2,not as good as I had hoped,"I came to this book with high hopes, but was disappointed. It has some very good writing and some very gripping sequences. But some of the sentences are stiff and obscure. And overall, the book did not flow. And the contrast between the ordinary world of the children and the fantastic world they became enmeshed in was too stark and jarring. The various aspects of the fantastic world are thrown pell mell at the reader with little development or integration. The sequence where the children get lost in the tunnels deep in the mountain is just so shatteringly hopeless as it starts out, I never really recovered. The author is just so ridiculously matter of fact about it."
5,little known children's classic,"Of the thousands (or so) of books I read as a child, this is one of the few that I have remembered."
5,A VERY enjoyable book!!!,"I had read a few reveiws on another of Alan Garner's books, ""The Owl Service"", saying that the style of Alan Garner was mysterious, and the end of the book left you wanting more or left you slightly dissatisfied. When I picked up ""The Wierdstone of Brisingamen,"" I was immediatly enthralled 25 pages in. The book had me dizzy with suspense and sheer enjoyment. The characters were wonderfully described, and all the names were introduced at a good rate. The book was so good that I couldn't put it down! I was in the world of the book. When I reached the end, the very last page, I wanted more; I was stunned, and flipping through the rest of the book looking for an epilogue. Of course, there was none, and I was a bit disapointed. So yes: I think this book is slightly mysterious, but very, very enthralling. Thank God Alan Garner has written other books as well: I can't wait to read them! I reccomend this book to ages eleven and up, up up..."
4,Weirdstone,"In simple, descriptive prose it's quite a scary book for young children, even without the paraphernalia of Harry Potter they seem to devour unscathed. My only criticisism is that the characters of the two main kids are not more interesting though the girl is more developed than her brother. The excitement is there though and I recommend the style."
1,Not really a Destroyer at all,I couldn't believe someone gave this a 5 star review until I saw he had only read 3 books in the series. Anyone who has read them all through the years would have to be disappointed in this adventure. The plot and action are ok but the characters are still off the mark. This is an improvement over the new author's previous attempt and hopefully he will continue to improve. If not there are going to be many long time readers who may become former readers.
2,Still Missing The Mark!!,"The new writer is progessing,his book 2 is a few inches better than the first.The tone is still way off.Mainly because of the interaction between Remo and Chiun.Their father/son dynamic is what has elevated the novels above and beyond all the others that are on the market..It has been shattered by this writer..again Remo treats his ""little father"" like garbage..""Shut up,Chiun""..""I'm stronger than you Chiun""..Total disrespect..It throws the rest of the book way off when the core characters are so jumbled..But hope springs eternal..The series has survived bad writers but no series survives many...Pray for #137..."
2,"again, where are the weights?","I was sertiously considering buying this item until I noticed that the weights do not come with it. I have decided without the weights, the purchase is not worth it."
3,"It looks right, but doesn't tighten well","My last coupler stripped out from repeated use. It took me a long time to find this one, but eventually I did. It appeared that it was an original OEM replacement and it does look exactly like the one that stripped out. The issue is that I have to tighten it down much more than the original (to the point my hand hurts) to ensure the attachment doesn't slip around. I am able to get it tight enough to not slip, but I have no doubt that this one will strip out quickly because of it."
2,very disappointed with this book,"I'dont know why bradygames make a book like this for a very good rpg game maybe the best of the series I've already finished disc one and I didn't really need the book and I got to tell you that I already bought it. It's very disappointed to me buying a guide and wasting my money and still have to look for things on the web, I don't think that was a marvelous idea because you have to search for a hint that it's not on the book instead you got a code for a special web site and also not a very good one. I hope in the following final fantasy sequencies for the playstation 2 make better strategy guides with helpful hints in the book not on the web."
1,Please save your money,This book is a sad joke.You have one of two choices. Its go online and wait forever or just suffer.All it is good for is killing bugs.Please don`t buy this get a unofficial guide.
1,What is the point of a guide with half the info not there?,I got the guide expecting it to be full of great information instead I must spend time trying to get on a site that does not seem to work 90 percent of the time. Even if they get playonline working right what about those who do not have internet access? Playonline is a nice idea but should not be used in the book the way it is.
2,Not even a guide,This book isn't even a guide. All it does is direct you to links. Why couldn't they have just put all the stuff on Play-Online into this book? Play-Online is slower that a jack-rabbit on Tuesday. Brady needs to hire David Cassady back to write the FF series guides.
2,Final Fantasy IX official Strategy Guide,"This book has beautiful pictures and tell all the aspects off the game, but you have to go to there website to learn these aspects. This ""call out box"" idea is terrible. They say if you are still haveing trouble with the very little info we gave you you can waste more of your time at our website."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!","What is wrong with Squaresoft?! People buy strategy guides so that they can find the information about the secrets and best way to master a game, not so they can read ""If you want to know how to do this, or if you want to know what these things do, or if you want to know how to find this treasure, or if you want to see maps of a certain place, you'll have to go online to OUR website and punch in awkward keywords that addresses a server that is either down or extremely slow making it nearly impossible to find any of the information you were looking for in the first place, despite having paid money for the book"" This strategy guide is nothing but pretty pictures and ""codes"" for finding the information you want immediately but have to slog through online. In my opinion, this is the worst strategy guide I have ever owned."
3,"A good guide, nothing more.","There is one inherent problem with this guide: there isn't much OF a guide. Half of the time when you get to an important part or you want to complete a side or secret quest, it directs you to the PlayOnline website, where you have to enter a code to get the info. If I honestly wanted to go online to get information for this game, I wouldn't have wasted my money on the guide to begin with. There are dozens of FULL guides for this game online, and they are absolutely FREE (and probably easier to understand). So, unless you're a person that likes to look at pretty pictures rather than get a good grasp of the game, or you like graphs and charts more than a full blown guide, I'd have to not reccomend this."
1,Not recommended anymore,"The guide relies heavily on the ability of the user to access the Playonline.com website for much of its content. Four years ago, the information existed on Playonline.com. I know that because I used it then. Playonline.com has deleted all of the FF9 information, and it no longer exists anywhere else. You will be better off looking on the web for walkthroughs."
1,Not very good,"ok, i would actually give it 0 stars if i could. it was almost zip help. and if u got this book and dont have the net i feel sorry for u. this book heavily relies on there stupid site to find out stuff insetead of them straight telling u.ex. this area is where the best weapon in the game is obtained. want to know how to get it? enter this keyword at playonline. Chrono cross had a good guide. ff8 had a good guide, this one isnt a guide at all. to tell u the truth y not save the trouble and just go to gamefaqs instead."
1,Not on par with what I expect from the company,"This strategy seems at best less that a third finished. As pointed out by many other reviewers, it always redirects you to playonline.com. I'd like to play the game not surf the net. Second, where are the maps? I can't even find them online! I have never seen an RPG stategy guide without maps before. What information is left in the guide after taking out the tidbits for playonline is spotty and very hard to use. The few times that I have tried to use playonline.com it has been slow or down. The site itself is hard to navigate.I'd like to see an unofficial stategy guide that does not rely heavily on the net to give useful information. It would be hard to make a worse stategy guide than this."
2,Play Online?,"This by far is one of the worst strategy guides I have ever bought. The ""new"" Play Online option is terrible. I bought the stragedy guide to help me through the game, not to make me look on the internet every page. Plus, even when I tried to get on to the Play Online website, it was always to busy and having problems. The guide it's self is very unorgnized, and leaves out important info. For the final boss of the game, they don't even give you a strategy. I didn't buy the guide for them to tell me to find out myself how to cure a problem. The worst of all is that it is very confusing. I had many times where I had no idea what they meant. The strategy guide does, however, give an ok walkthrough of the game for people who try to beat the games without help, and if they get stuck, they can fefer to the guide."
1,I want to give 0 Star!,Don't even TRY getting this guide. I bought this 11-dollar guide for a good reason...I don't want to go ONLINE to look up for the FFIX tips. Guess what? This guide tells you very few information and tells you to go on PlayOnline.com for MORE information. Well..I DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING PLAYONLINE. Do you expect me to go online everytime I need help?!
1,Sucks,"-Buy game: about $39-Then buy guide: about $14-Then waste your time on the internet when all the info you paid 14 bucks for should be in the frigging book: PricelessDon't buy this book unless you need to, and when you're done, return it or trade it in at a Sell/Buy/Trade game shop"
1,Don't waste your money,"Few things disappoint me enough to actually write a review. This guide book is a joke compared to others I have purchased for the previous games. I wouldn't be so upset if the web site that it constantly refers to was actually useful. The site isn't searchable, and none of the hints have links to the other sections they reference. About the only useful things in this book are the list of weapons and skills, and the map. Things I would have liked to see, besides actual help and not just codes to look up stuff on the web site, would be a list of weaknesses for the monsters listed in the back, locations for some of the weapons and armor, etc. As the other reviews have stated, there are many online help sites with way more information than this guide and the PlayOnline site combined, and they won't cost you a penny. Save yourself the money, go online and find yourself a few decent walkthroughs. You'll be glad you did."
3,Not totally helpful,"I picked this strategy guide up with the game, like I usually do when I buy a new Final Fantasy. The difference this time was that it didn't offer the kind of information that a strategy guide should offer. It would start to tell you about a secret and then it would refer you to Squaresoft's ""PlayOnline website"" where you could learn more information. It does this all the time, at least twice or three times per page, and while it is neat to look all of the information up on the website, which is pretty well made, sometimes it is more convenient to have a guide sitting next to you while you play the game than to run to the computer every time you have a question."
1,[...] - Should Be Free,"This book only makes reference to better things you can find online. Don't buy the book, just go to their website. It's horrible that they could actually legally sell this."
1,This is the worst guide I have ever purchased,"Just thinking about this guide pisses me off - what a waste of money! Imagine reading a novel or a textbook that, after a few general and cursory sentances, reads ""please visit our web site to read more!"" Annoying? That is an understatement. I paid good money for this book and it is completely useless. The little information that is provided in the guide is far too general to be of any benefit. There aren't even any maps!!! Even worse, to derive any benefit, I have to login to Playonline.com and give them marketing information about myself. Jerks! My advice: skip this book and print out a walkthrough from a game site."
1,horrible,this guide dose not tell you how to beat anyone!i had to figure most of it out myself.the game is bad too.you are much better off getting ff10.icant belive people call it a strategy guide!!
3,Good at the time...,"Basically, all it does is tell you how to do most of the easy stuff in the game. Actually, it doesn't really tell you any of the important stuff, because you had to sign up for Playonline to get the real secrets and etc. However, Playonline has stopped its FF9 services so anyone looking for it will be very disappointed. This is really just for those people who collect it to say that you have the strategy guide to FF9. To tell you the truth you'll find better guides on gamefaqs.com... The only thing that is nice is the color picturing and the basic bestiary. I liked the images they had of each character. Also, it is definitely one of the thinnest guides I've ever bought too..."
1,"Waste of money, time and effort","This entire book is nothing but an advertisement for the 'PlayOnLine' website. It gives some maps and some simple hints that you could easily have figured out on your own. However, are you looking for the best weapons? You'll have to visit PlayOnLine. Want to develop your Chocoba? PlayOnLine. Sidequests? Play...oh, you get the idea. If you don't have internet access, you're toast. even if you do, the PlayOnLine website is NOT friendly. It's slow, and the info you're trying to get is pretty well buried. You'd do better printing out one of the many online strategies put out from the private sector on the net. I seriously hope Bradygames catches a clue (and losses some revenue) from this worthless nonsense."
2,"Close, but.. oh wait! There's a cigar Online?!","In comparison, to Brady Game's Strategy Guide for Final Fantasy VIII, this one is sorely lacking. The information is presented in a disorganized fashion, making it unclear who can learn certain skills from items, as well as what skills they actually can learn. But, the main problem I have with this guide is it's ""PlayOnLine Enchancement."" To get most of the really good hints and charts you have to go online, using codes found in the book. Which I think kind of makes the book futile. The point of getting the Strategy Guide is so you have a quick reference to items, skills, and events in the game; not so you have codes to go online to find them. But, the information is there....if you don't mind looking for it."
2,playonline site is horrible,"Well this is a fine mess, you pay for the book and then it refers you to an online address that you must register for and doesn't work. I suggest you save you money and use the great sites like gamefacs.com and rpgamers.com."
2,Great for propping up chairs.,I want to give this guide a one star review but it is just so perfect for correcting off balance chairs and tables that I can't possibly do that.
1,"one more book like this, Brady Game will go out of business!",What are these people with Brady Game thinking? Writing a strategy guide with absolutely no help to gamers?! Are they out of their minds?
4,This is good!,"Many people say that this book is a sorry exuse for a strategy guide. This is untrue. The reasons I say this are: 1) It keeps the game fun, when they tell you where everything is it takes the exploring concept out of the game. 2) It gives good stradegy for bosses, it doesn't tell you what to do every single round, you can use your own strategy. 3) It talks about everything in the game but provides almost NO spoilers. 4) It tells you about side quests and mini-games but doesnt ruin everything like the prizes."
4,Useful book except for one thing,"The book is helpful, especially with the Play Online site. The only problem is that there is no maps of each area, so you get lost very easily."
3,This is my review,"I ordered the book because I had the game, but hadn't been able to find the book in the stores. It's a cheat book for a PlayStation game. So far it actually seems to help less than the other books I've used in the past, but until I actually finish the game, I won't really be able to comment fully on that. If you're playing a Final Fantasy game, always get the book."
1,Enough with the PlayOnline references,"Uh, when I buy a strategy guide, it's partially because I don't WANT to have to go on some website to find out every little detail separately. So, even if the PlayOnline section for FFIX was still active (which it is not, so the references are dead too), this would still be a pretty pointless book.Refresh my memory: If all this info (and much, much more) was available for free at the official website, what's the point of having the guide in the first place?"
2,This is a bad guide!!!,When i first bought this i thought it would tell you where everything is but all it says is go to playonline. back then i didnt have internet so it was useless!!!
1,A waste,"After playing FF8 with the excellent strategy guide for it, I expected the same to happen with FF9. However, this guide does very little to help you. As a matter of fact I don't even see why this guide was made.To start off, the walkthrough section is just horrible. It only touches on the basic objectives of each area and then tells you to go to playonline.com for the in-depth strategy guide. Didn't these idiots know that the reason most people buy these guides is so that they don't have to run to their computers for a strategy guide? Trust me, you'd be better off without any guide at all than this one. The bestiary is incomplete and the guide for accessories/abilities is lackluster. If you've used any of the other guides then you would know why I say this one sucks.Overall I don't recommend this guide AT ALL. There should be no reason at all for you to buy this guide. You would be better off to just go to playonline.com and save your money."
2,A rip-off,"What is in the book is good quality stuff; what is NOT in the book makes it not worth the money to buy it. You buy a strategy guide for the STRATEGY (and maps, weapons lists, etc), not as a come-on to a website. Throughout the book you are prodded, time after time, to get on the internet, go to playonline.com, type in a ""keyword"", and retrieve information that should've been in the book in the first place. As if that wasn't bad enough, playonline.com only has Final Fantasy XI now. If they've archived FFIX and FFX I couldn't find them. So, basically, I unknowingly bought half a book. Very disappointing..."
1,Zero stars,I found more help in one of the Game magazines.A guide such as this should tell you about side quests and item characteristics. This guide misses too much.It refers you to the On-line site which doesn't work right. Read the message boards there and they agree. Don't buy this unless you have nothing else to help you walk through.
3,Helpful in the least way,"I picked up this book along with the game and sad to say this book was of no help. It seemed like an advertisement for the website that had the ""real secrets"". Whats the real kicker is that this guide tells you just enough to get you by, meanwhile your still lost or still don't understand what you are suposed to do. The fact that it says to go to that certain website is bad enough but half the time the site is down! Save your money. Maybe this book is suposed to be symbolic? ;)"
1,Different Author,"The reason why this guide is so bad is that it was written by a different guy (Dan Birlew)than in the previous guides by David Cassidy. My theory is that this new guy is the MOD for PlayOnline.com. There is absolutely NOTHING in this guide that you could not find on the website. NOTHING. Do not buy this guide, and if you have one, I recommend that you return it immediately so that BradyGames will get a clue and never write a sorry excuse for a guide like this again."
2,What Happened???,"I don't know what they were thinkin when they decided to make a guide like this, I could've got a free guide that was 10X more detailed."
2,Sucks...,"Its the uncomplete guide I ever seen!!! You had to have internet to explore the secret. Well, I think the only thing you need is internet than this guide. You can find all the secrets you need to know. You can buy it IF only you are a collector or something(like me ^_^)."
1,Pathetic.,"The only reason i rated this item at 1 star was because you can't give it a ""0"". This isn't worthy of being called a ""strategy"" guide. Unless you're willing to run back and forth between the game and playonline.com, there is no reason to buy this. It's useless, horrible, and downright pathetic. I hope this helps you. DON'T BUY THIS GUIDE!"
2,terrible tactic,"This guide was the worst guide I've ever used. The Playonline stuff was more of a nuisance than a help. It was annoying and made me curse on more than one occasion. This was a large step down from the awesome FFVIII and FFVII guides. Sorry, but don't make this mistake again Brady Games, it'll cost ya! This is the first time I wasn't impressed by your guide."
2,rape of the strategy guide,"The only reason why i didn't give this guide 1 star was because it had a few helpful hints..but the main point of such a low score was because linking the guide to playonline was a stupid move!! That's not much of a strategy, and half the time playonline was down or ""performing an illegal operation"". They really degraded the guide with linking it to playonline. they had no strategies for defeating bosses, winning mini-games, locations of weapons, cards, or stellazios. This is worth so much less then they want for it. Don't bother buying it."
1,Save your money...,"Save your money on this book. I bought this book for a friend who doesn't have a PC. She was upset about it because all of the good tips and strategies require you to have a PC with Internet Access.To me it seems like the made the book, removed the helpful information and force you to visit their website to view the hints and there advertisements.I wouldn't suggest this book as a gift. If the person you are giving it to has Internet access there are many sites on the net that gives more detailed information than this book does. Instead of the book, give them a free print out of the walkthrough and hint pages off the Internet."
2,Big Mistake for Squaresoft,"In the past dan birlew and brady games have done an excellent job on strategy guides for squaresoft. FF9, however, was a departure from their typical strategy guides. I paid ""good money"" for this guide at a bookstore, and it had none of the info(with some exceptions) which I was looking for. Every other sentence in this guide is,""...for more info check out Playonline.com"". aarrgghh! I paid money to get this in print, not to spend an entire day off printing everything off this site. Nothing is more frustrating then trying to enjoy a game, but then having to spend time on the internet to find something that you could have looked up in 2 minutes. Birlew did a good job,mind you, but this whole ""PlayOnline.com"" thing was Square's attempt to break into a new market and to prepare gamers for FF11 and frankly it's not worth ""whatI paid."""
1,I have a dream...,I have a dream...that the people who wrote this book will never do this mistake again.I have a dream...that the Dan Birlew will hopefully write a better guide for the future Final Fantasy games.
2,Want to buy half a book? Here you are!,"If this is a joke, it must be a bad one. * Want to know more about bad jokes? Visit playonline.com!Why do I need a book, if all that it does is telling me to visit playonline.com? * Spent money on a useless book? Playonline.com will tell you why!As far as I'm concerned, Bradygames always did a very good job in writing strategy guides. I think, this dynasty has come to an end. * Want to know more about good jobs? Playonline.com will tell you absolutely NOTHING about this!!!"
3,The playonline idea sucks,"Basically, the guide is ok to guide you through the events about the Final Fantasy 9, but whenever it comes to an important phrase, it says to go to the wedsite called Playonline.com which is dreadky slow due to the heavy traffic. I bought the book is try to complete the game with ease not jumping aroud to my pc and log the site for detail information, why I purchase the book if i can get better details from the wedsites. If you wanted to complete all the sidequests, the guide gave no further information about where to locate them but they simply said LOG ON TH THE PLAYONLINE.COM, I certainly hope that brady games will abadon the stupid idea of using wedsites and print all the information we needed in the stragety guide itself."
2,KeyCode Online?!?!,"I usually like play the Final Fantasy more than once. I had to restart some of Final Fantasy games because, I missed a lot of items or some of side-quests. I bought the guide book for Final Fantasy VI and I was able to follow through it without any trouble. However; I bought the guide Book for Final Fantasy IX Well, I can't believe you HAVE TO go ONLINE every TIME you want to find out more about the items or side-quest and you have to go online and type the stupid keywords to find out, Which is complete waste of time! The problem is here, when you DO go online The FF9 keyword Or even the FF9 site itself isn't on there anymore! So, it was kind of pointless of buying this book. Since you are better off with Gamefaqs or Rpgclassic walkthrough."
3,It was good,"This was a good strategy guide. The main point of a strategy guide is to tell you what to do for the main course of the game. It is not really supposed to focus on side quests that aren't required. You should figure that out on your own. I do have to admit though with other people, it is annoying that when you want to look for something that you really want to accomplish that is a side quest, it says that go to PlayOnline. That can be frustrating. Other than that, it was pretty good for giving you strategy and step by step. If you want this guide, jsut don't expect help on side quests. This book is only good for the main course and what to do that is required, no optional stuff at all pretty much."
1,This is the worst strategy guide ever,"This strategy guide provided the least amount of information for the money. I was so tired of running back and forth to the website (which did not even have the decency to be a good website). The website also wouldn't work with my printer, which meant any information that I obtained had to be copied and pasted to another application before I could print it. A major headache. I think the reason anyone buys a guide is to get the secrets of the game. If I wanted to work for the secrets, I'd have saved my money and figured them out myself. I can't get my money back, but I can warn others about this ...sorry strategy guide. I only hope that this experiment will never be repeated. Next time squaresoft comes out with a guide, I'll open and inspect it first."
1,Worst of the Worst,"Every page of this strategy guide says (at least once, often 2 or 3 times) ""...and to find out EXACTLY how to do this or find that, visit our website!""...what a terrible, terrible, TERRIBLE idea for a strategy guide, and for one of the greatest RPGs ever made too! A real shame."
2,"Very weak guide, save your money.",I bought this guide right after the game came out a couple years ago. I had purchased other final fantasy guides and they had all been very helpful. This one they really bombed. The whole thing is pretty much a plug for their website playonline.com. You get constantly told to go to the website to get any real hints. Not recommended
2,Barely Adequate,"Final Fantasy IX is a wonderful game and a very good buy. This guide, on the other hand, is not. It seems as though Brady Games has been on a downward spiral in relation to Final Fantasy strategy guides. VII had a wonderful guide, VIII had a decent guide, and this one stinks. Well, not stinks, but if you are a player like me, who thrives on totally dominating a game and making your team invincible, this guide doesn't do it. The ""enhanced by PlayOnline"" approach is ridiculous. People want the information in the book, not on a web-site. If the PlayOnline information had originally been included in the book I would have rated this a four, but as it is I'm selling mine and sticking to fan written FAQ's."
2,All this book represents is a referral to an online site,"Im overly dissapointed with this title. Sure all the other Brady Guides for previous Final Fantasy titles were flawed, but you could live with them. At least they had information in the book and not a constant referral to playonline.com. The entire format is presented like this for everything. Want more information ... refer to playonline.com. Want any information about anything? Refer to playonline.com. If im stuck I like to have the book in front of me and be able to read and follow along with my playing. I also like to have information about skills etc so I can plan an effective strategy for character advancement. Which brings us to another problem, the website itself is very hard to get on to. I managed to create a user id, but since then it just times out whenever i try to access the north american site. You know what? How about you save yourself some money and just refer to online faq's that you can print out."
1,I wish I read the reviews first....,"I know this game has been out for a while, but anyone who's playing it now and looking for a guide LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE. I wasted money buying and returning this stupid thing because all it did was tell me to go to Playonline.com every other page. If I wanted to go online for information, I could do it for free! The whole point of having a strategy guide is having all the info right in front of you, and this does not do that job."
2,THE WORST FINAL FANTASY GUIDE I HAVE SEEN!,"Let me start by saying that I own 1 of each of the Official US Final Fantasy guides available for the Playstation. So I speak from experience. This guide will help you considerably on your journey through the vast lands of Final Fantasy 9. HOWEVER! EVERY other Final Fantasy Guide is done far better. In this guide they give vauge discriptions of what to do and then they tell you to go to there web site for More detailed information.Talk about bogus! All the other guides F.F.7,8,10,Anthology,Chronicals,&Origins All give far more detail on what to do. If you want to beat this game and find all the secrets this guide is needed. So is Internet access HOWEVER! If you need help buy this guide but be for warned it is not as good as the rest of the F.F. guides. This is proven by the fact that this was the only 1 in the series to be made this way! Over all I was dissapointed with this guide but it is better than nothing. BARELY!"
1,dan birlew must be stopped,"presumably it's unfair to blame dan birlew for this travesty. i'm sure he wanted to write a really, really great guide filled with useful information, and square and brady instead forced him to take out all the bits that you actually look for in a guide -- you know, like INFORMATION -- and instead insert a lot of plugs for their website... But that's really neither here nor there. Some [not nice] person, or collection of people, is responsible for this travesty, and all you and I can do is see that they don't profit from it. Fight the power! Don't buy this guide!"
1,you call this a guide?,Whats the point of buying a guide if the guide tells you to go online to find out what u need to know...Just goto playonline.com and print the whole guide out!! Don't waste ur money on this useless book.
2,A Guide With Online Sections? Ugh!,"This is the worst guide I have ever seen. Seeing as half of it is online. To access the most important stuff you must have internet access and you must sign up at PlayOnline.com. Now it may very well be that they are trying to attract fans to PlayOnline.com but this is ridiculous.If you are stuck in a part of the game, then this guide is useful, but to get the most out of a game, I would recommend finding a fan written online guide instead of using this. It is appauling, and I regret purchasing it."
1,worst strategy guide in the history of video gaming,"...Want to know how to beat a tough boss?The guide will tell you a weeee bit and then(drumroll,please)[give you a web site to go to] for more details.Want to know how to find a hard to get item?Needhelp with one of the mini-games?GO TO [the web site].....that's all this ...guide is!!A huge advertisment for their extremely slow running site!I actually don't like FF9 just because of how bad the strategy guide is!Guess I was at least lucky enough to have internet access in my house...This is just another example of how the final fantasy series is going down the tubes...fast!The only small reason to get this guide is if you're a collector and manage to find one of the first few ones published with the slightly diffrent cover(it might be slightly valubale)Otherwise,pass up this guide!..."
2,What?,"The ONLY thing it helps out with is the storyline, and if you need help getting through the basic storyline, you shouldn't be playing it. I do not like using a players guide for getting through the game, just for the fact they usually spoil the surprises, I use players guides for the secrets! And this book doesn't have em. I ended up not using it at all... It does have good pictures though....."
2,Hey I didn't know,"I was ashamed when i started using this guide. Who ever thought of the playonline thing is crazy. Thiis strategy guide is barley detailed. It just relies on going on the internet to find something!!! Here an example:the guide says search the area to find a very impotant item, to find and figure out what the item does go to playonline.com. I mean who wants to go on the internet when there sittin down playin there game. And the secrets sections are terrible. example: go to the town on disc three to get a new weapon this is very complicated so go to playonline.com. This strategy guide is terrible. The least i can say is you can get it just to move forward in the game but for anything else use it as toleit paper."
2,I expected much more...,"I would like to say first and foremost that a great effort was put out to make this guide, I am sure, but it was just not up to par. I felt like I paid for two things- one, a very brief and vague strategy guide, and two, a set of passcodes to a website. What really made me upset was that I found you didn't really even need the guide for the website- all you need to do is register, sign in, and self navigate, even without the passcodes. I really felt betrayed by Brady- my last two guides, Final Fantasy VII and Vagrant Story, were wonderfully detailed- covering every corner of the game-and then some- without spoilers. Although the Final Fantasy IX guide has no spoilers, I still was very dissatisfied with this book. Bottom line- you can use different websites and get better information than this guide or the playonline.com site combined. If this trend of strategy guides continues, perhaps I'll buy Prima next time."
1,Extended advertising for PlayOnline.com,"I made the mistake of buying two copies of this book for friends who I'd also bought the game for. Each and every interesting tip and sidequest is not found in the book, but on Square's PlayOnline.com website. Scant bits of information are given with a little ""Want more information on how to do this? Visit PlayOnline.com!"" blurb to intice you on to the site. In fact, some pages include more of the ""PlayOnline"" ads than actual information.If this is the future of videogame strategy guides, online walkthroughs will definitely be more attractive. They might lack the glossy pages and screenshots of the books, but they're not an extended ad for an online service either.Do NOT make the same mistake I did. Avoid this book at all costs."
2,"Do not Buy: no longer ""Up To Date""",Most of the details in the book require you to go online to a website that is out of service. Most of what is included in the book itself is available by being observant in the game.
1,Terrible,The American version of this guide is worthless. The playonline links are no longer valid. If you can find one the UK guide is complete and does not rely on links. I was lucky to find one while traveling the UK and it is far far better.
3,Online Access,This book was very helpful except for the fact that I don't have access to a computer at my house and I didn't realize that you needed internet access to obtain some of the hints from playonline. Otherwise helpful.
1,"i was seriously disappointed, the game [was] seriously bad.","i swear, this is probably the worst thing money can buy. i was so seriously disappointed, i thought that when they said ""detailed walkthrough"" it meant there was a detailed walkthrough. my grandma could write something better and make a better game than this. you're wasting your money jack. i agree, they seriously forgot to put the strategy guide, into the strategy guide. no strategy at all. what if the reader doesn't have internet, like my friend, huh? well they did good on FFVIII's and FFX's strategy guides so i'm happy, but this is seriously a disappointment."
1,Stay away!,"I bought this guide with Final Fantasy 9 in the hopes of actually getting help. No luck there. You go through the guide hoping to find the secrets and hidden items to make your game 100% complete. It then tells you to sign-up and give your personal information to a site to get that info. The membership is free ,but I thought the purpose of the guide books were so you didn't have to run to the computer every 5 minutes for help. This guide is a total waste of money. Only get this guide if you are payed to do so."
1,They need to re-release this guide,With a version that doesn't refer you to the web page 1000 times. Not all of us have internet access where the TV is. I think they lameness of this guide ruined the game for me. Or maybe it was because the target audience of the game was non-adults. Oh well the Final Fantasy series is over once it goes online anyway. Some of us have connections that are too poor to play online games. Biggest mistake they ever made.
1,Terrible,"What is the point of getting a guide if you have to keep referring to a website for the information you need? I am in training for the Army and I only get a small amount of internet time so getting the guide is completely useless for me. Hopefully, the makers of this guide will abandon this idea and get back to what they were doing before."
2,This will drive you crazy,"Ok you need to understand one key deatil about this guide first. Every secret, every code, and every trick is not in this book. As a matter of fact everyone of them is intentionally left out. See the trick is when everything is online at www.playonline.com So, while playing the game if you want to know something, the book actaully says in it ""To find out how to... goto www.playonline and use **** keyword.""Honestly, all the actually codes, tricks, and hints, are online. The only thing this guide has is the keywords you need to find them. You get the keyword out of the book, and type it into a special spot on the playonline website.Now unless you have an constant internet connection and can have constant access to a pc while playing, this book is worthless."
1,"Mother of God, why?","I have to say that this is one of the most asinine ideas for a book ever. Not all of the information is in the book. Instead, every few pages you will need to know something, and the page will ask you to go online for more information. I don't see how this could serve any practical purpose other than to save the publisher money. All of the other Final Fantasy games were roughly as long as Final Fantasy IX, and the guides for these managed to cover nearly every facet of those games. If you've already wasted your money on this guide, take a couple of hours and download all the necessary info on the internet at once. It will save you a lot of heartache later."
2,Extremely annoying...,"When my sister first received the game from my mom, the guide book was only five dollars...and then we were in the most annoying part of playing through the game...Often when my sister needed some extra ""help"" with PlayOnline, she got me to type in the password on the computer...she's always been lucky that I was online, otherwise she would have to boot it up herself, and type in the password. This had to be the most frustrating, because at times, it wouldn't even help out much.The idea of using PlayOnline with a video game is absolutely the worst idea you could ever have. What if some of the PSX players didn't own a computer? True, most folks to nowadays, but...the enhancement?! The idea of a guidebook was to help you out through the game and find some other puzzles along the way...I honestly think that if you need help with Final Fantasy IX, save your money. Just look up an online walkthrough instead..."
1,Worst Strat Guide,"This guide was horrible, I tore it apart just for some of the Artwork, but then I threw that away as well. It's a waste of time and money. I beat the game without it, and like others have said, it's just a advertisement for playonline, which is fine site, but they should have just packed it in the book. There were no solutions from the guide that were of any use. Oh well, don't buy this book."
1,A huge waste of money,"Completely refrain from buying this book at all costs. Itcontains absolutely nothing you can use-and constantly directs you tothe website that has been created by Squaresoft...It's not an""authorized"" book (by Squaresoft), but I've looked thruit(after playing the game), and it seems to include everything that ison the Squaresoft website (no pictures are included, though), and youcan dowload it to your computer for free."
1,What's the purpose?,"I bought this guide thinking it would be as helpful as all the other guides I'd bought from Brady Games in the past. That's what I get for thinking. This book is NOT a guide, it hardly helps you through general gameplay let alone helping you with the secrets of the game. It is however an advertisement for PlayOnline.com, which is rarely accessable. Don't buy this ""book"", try PlayOnline... If it's working."
2,I would demand a refund...,"I bought the 'bradygames' final fantasy 8 strategy guide when it came out, even though a different strategy guide was available, the reason i choose the bradygames version is because the other version was almost exactly the same as an online version.with final fantasy 9 it feels like i spent 12 bucks for a book of 'easy access' codes to playonline. every detail that is usually covered in a strategy guide has a small blue box next to it that says 'for more details go to playonline!'. i dont want to go to playonline! i would have skipped buying the book if i knew that almost this entire guide was filled with ads for playonline...i would think that two actions are appropriate1) create a 2nd edition and send it to everyone who bought one of these guides.2) send out refundsnormally i would live with it, but i expect so much more from bradygames, and squaresoft.--clint d."
1,I Felt ILL...,"when I finally got this guide home and saw that all it really was , was an idiotic advertisement for Play Online. Brady Games has lost me as a customer, and has taught me the valuable lesson of looking at a guide before I buy it to make sure this doesn't happen again. I yearn for the days of VERSUS Books and their FFVII style guide. I was upset when I had to settle for Brady for FFVIII and now I am just sick to my stomach that I have a worthless guide in my hands. My computer is far away from my play station and so I am unable to use the book to any success. Squaresoft should be ashamed with itself."
2,The guides keep getting worse and worse...,"A feeling of total regret is how I can best sum up thisstrategy guide after I had purchased it and given it a look through.Let me tell you how this guide works, because the editors say its a""truly interactive experience."" Whatever. If you're lookingfor all the secrets in this one book, gotta look else where. Instead,everything goes into depth on the World Wide Web and put a specialcode into the web-site to get most of the secrets, NOT THE BOOK. Ifind this pretty frusterating because I paid ... to get all thesecrets without having to log onto the web to find out every secret.Now I am someone with easy access to the web. Now lets say someonewith out the WWW got this guide. They'd miss out big time. Couldn'tfind the description of magic, ultimate weapons, side quests. Besidesall that, its a decent guide, just missing the essentials of being aguide. BradyGames and SquareSoft, shame on you. Go back to the oldschool like how you did FFVII. Two stars."
2,Good if your computer is next to your Playstation!,"Unfortunately, this is a typical Brady Games guide, but with one major flaw. It only spoon-feeds you some information and if you want the rest, you have to go to the website to get it. This is perfect if your PC just happenes to be next to your Playstation. It's typical in that it spoils some of the storyline if you get close to the end.Hopefully, someone will write an actual strategy guide that doesn't spoil anything yet give you the information you seek without going online."
1,The single worst strategy guide ever,If I could do it all over again I would have saved my money and bought an unofficial strategy guide instead of this trash.
1,Final Fantasy IX,"Not much of a helper. Youd be better off just looking things up online. Besides, thats what I did after I bought the guide. Refers to a website that no longer exist without intensly searching google with the right criteria."
2,And The Razzy Goes To...,"This is easily the worst strategy guide I have ever seen. The Bestiary is all of 7 pages long. The Secrets and Side-Quests section (usually my primary reason for buying a guide)is also 7 pages long. The guide's advice for fighting every boss boils down to ""Try to not die.""And the book's excuse for providing absolutely no information whatsoever? Well, just type in this handy code on our web site and you'll get the information you paid for!...but... that's why I bought the book! But tough luck. Save your money and download the free guides and walkthroughs at gamefaqs.com.Also, if you did buy the book and can no longer access the website, it is now hosted at:http://www.square-enix-usa.com/strategy/FF9/"
2,Not worth it at all,"I didn't pay $10 for a worthless walkthrough I didn't need.Nothing I wanted in here is here.Unlike old Brady Games guides, that have information on secret weapons, secrets to unlock, secret quests, this has nothing. It has a simple walk through, and prompts on every page to enter a keyword at PlayOnline.com for more information, and little teasers about what the information MAY be about.IE ""someone in your party needs an upgrade! to find out who, enter this keyword in Playonline.com!""well whats the problem with that?aparently, that part of Play Online has been deleted, so there is no way to do that. Basically, you just get no information at all, except for a very basic walk through that you dont need.Dont get this its a terrible investment."
1,Wish it was better,"Like many other gamers I buy a strategy guide to have all my hints in one place. This book barely gives you what you need and sends you to their website for the rest. You are basicaly at the mercy of how long they feel like keeping the site running or how much you are willing to print out to add to an already pricey book. There isn't a page in this book that doesn't have some sort of callout box suggesting you go the website to learn an even BETTER way to defeat a monster, or learn where this or that magic item is hidden. It gets frustrating and really takes away from the gameplay. Oh and as another reader pointed out you can't just go to the site you have to have a special game code for EACH hint.Overall, the book's redeeming qualities are its artwork and the fact you couldn't really find some of the items and answer questions in a timely manner without it."
4,One of the best books for church leadership.,"True to form for Dr. Gangel, this book contains lots of useful information helpful in educating Christian workers for team leadership. It's concrete, easy to read, and loaded with bibliographical references that will expand the reader's sights in a variety of topics."
3,not bad,"This book is average. Honestly, there are better books on Christian education out there. Not a bad read, but you may not gain much"
1,NOTHING NEW HERE... SAVE YOUR MONEY...,This is by the same author trying to sell herbal pills to kids... is there no end to those trying to prey upon the unhappy and insecure... simply eat less and take some vitamins ... that's about all any of these books say... save your money...
2,"""Follies"" was an unfortunate choice of title","I used to like Ann Beattie a whole lot back in the 70s and 80s when she seemed to have an ear for the anomie afflicting a generation. But this book seemed off-key most of time. Too many characters and too many plot threads for short stories. ""Write A Story"" shares an unfortunate stylistic connection with the children's book, ""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie."" The one story with any strong emotional effect is ""The Rabbit Hole as Likely Explanation"" about a woman's experience with her mother's Alzheimer's. But it was mistake to begin the collection with the dreary ""Flechette's Follies."" I would never have toiled to the end of that very long short story, or the collection, if I hadn't been stuck on a 14-hour plane ride. As a complete aside I must say, Beattie looks a bit like Joni Mitchell in the cover shot."
1,More like Zombies in Love,"I remember seeing this movie and it was awful. I felt there was no action, no plot. We called it Zombies in Love. I will give it a couple of points for decent make up and special effects. But mostly, it was BORING. Just could not get into it. Zombie movies should not be LOVE stories."
2,Well it is original but not great,"I like the idea of this film but it's just to slow and needed some spice, blood, action anything, I just stopped caring after awhile. I think the acting was fine but I would not buy this movie just move along to the next dvd."
2,Not So Great.....,"I bought this movie previously viewed and being a horror movie fan, I thought that this might be a good movie. Well, I can say I've seen alot better movies than this one. In a nutshell, a couple becomes stranded in the woods and discover what they think is a dead body. Wrong. After coming in contact with the ""dead body"", they both become infected with a deadly desease. They seek refuge in a deserted cabin because they have no where else to go. They soon realize that they will both suffer a horrible death. They turn to thoughts of murder in order to save their own lives. This flick contains a tiny bit of suspense but is basically a low budget movie that doesn't deliver alot to the viewer. I'd recommend renting it if you are really bored!"
1,Waste of Time,"The director of this movie made a poor attempt to spice up the horror genere.The dialogue was just plain bad, the actors gave weak performances, and the pace of the movie was slow and tiresome.This was as bad as watching Gigli.I gave it one star because the director/writer tried pretty hard to make something unique, but he failed immensly.If you want movies that are a little off key like this director tried to do, then stick with M. Night Shyamalan.Some caterpillars just aren't meant to be butterflies."
1,THIS MOVIE CRAWLS,"This movie crawls and deserves a double punch on your hacker's card. It begs the moral question, ""Is it okay to kill others to stay alive?"" We all already know the answer to that: Tele-marketers-yes, Pizza delivery boys-no. Beverly Hynds does a great acting job on a poorly written and developed script. The beginning scene of the boyfriend/girlfriend interaction during the car's flat tire was done well and brings out the differences between the sexes. However, once their flesh starts to rot, so does the movie. Beverly's back must be hurting from trying to carry this whole movie. A great movie to watch with emo friends you don't like."
3,Original but missed more power,"First I give 3 stars mainly because of the cinematography. Very well done. However, I agree the movie was original but be careful if you are looking for a faster movie. I think the script did not provide a strong dialogue. The movie tried to be philosophical but the dry conversations between the characters caused a disservice to the movie. The intention of the movie was great but my guess is that it was scripted very quickly and therefore, left the movie weak."
3,Well written for its time,"This book has been my bible for years, and I try to follow every word. However some parts of the book are very out of date. For example the diet it laughable, there arn't even any carbohydrates included. The book does offer some good tips on makeup, and is worth a read if you can find it."
5,"WOW, Another Outstanding Work from Tom Butler-Bowdon!","I liked Tom's first book, 50 Self Help Classic's, but I LOVE this one. I think it's much, much better. Why? Because in Tom's first book he addresses ""how to help yourself"" but in this book Tom teaches you ""how to achieve success!""(It could be I am saying this because I am a success author. Maybe that has something to do with it, won't you think? )Tom has a superb talent of capturing the essence of what was written down over the past 10 decades!If you want read the core empowering message contained in the top 50 books on reaching success - get this book today!Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated &Founder of CoachingWithResults.com"
3,50 Success Classics: Winning Wisdom for life and work from 50 Landmark Books,"Although I feel the work is ok, i somewhat feel a little mislead by the title. Actually i feel stupid I should have read the reviews, which i normally do. I didn't this time, as i said i was stupid. I really thought i was getting 50 classic books, when all it gave was a small summary o0f each book. The summarys were good but not good enough. I would not have bought this work if I had read the reviews of which I will always do from here on out."
4,Perfect soundtrack to a scary movie...,"What type of movie would this album fit? Something along the lines of The Blair Witch Project if you ask me. This CD is composed of 5 tracks. The 3 chapter tracks are all over 10 minutes in length and are basically long, stretched out, creepy ambient work. The other 2 tracks, clock in at about 5 mins each and use some pretty scary voice samples.Iszoloscope hasn't quite made an album like this before, but this work is supposed to be some of his earlier work that was originally created for a side project but turned into a Iszoloscope release.Listen at night with the lights off..."
1,"Worked for a week, and then no more glucose monitor...","This worked pretty well- for a week- then the glucose part stopped working.. The cuff works great- it is easy to program and simple to use.. don't need alot of blood for the monitor...The strips were a little fussy, but I go the hang of it eventually. Now we shall see how the Amazon return policy holds up... I will mail it back to them-"
5,A Fitting Tribute To 60's Pop Music,"Mama Guitar is a three-member girl band from Tokyo, Japan that play music that resembles the classic hits of 1963-1964. Their names are Iris(Lead Voc., Bass), Jun(Voc., Guitar), and Yoko(Drums) and they have, and still are performing in concerts all around Japan. The tracks on their CD are the type of songs that will make you sing and dance to and will make you happily think of simpler times. If you love J-Pop(Japanese Pop Music)and the music of the 60's, then you should buy this album. Also, check out the group's website at http://www.mamaguitar.jp(sorry, it's in Japanese)."
2,Button on the collar turns off easy,"When my dogs play around with each other the off button on the collar gets turned off. Then when I need to correct the dog it won't work, because it needs to be turned back on."
4,Great product without having to shock dog,"We don't believe in giving a shock, but we saw that there was a tone only feature and that is what we use and it is very effective. Have only needed to use the tone about 6 times and we've had it about 6 weeks, but our dog no longer chases after fast, noisy cars or trucks. He respects the collar and walks sweetly by our side now. Maybe all dogs will not respond to the tone, but ours did. Also, before my husband even put it on the dog he tested it on himself, and he didn't feel anything until the 4 setting and it was only a slight vibration for him. I don't care that he didn't feel anything we've agreed to only use the tone sparingly, and we are delighted with it's effectiveness! Our dog would also lead us on the walk, and he no longer tries to edge out in front, let alone drag me."
4,Hooks are plenty big,I ordered both the small hooks and the medium hooks. I have no pot or pan that is too big to use the smaller hook and I would recommend them over the larger size hook. The are well made but the decorative finish to tip makes it too large to fit in some smaller handles. They are certainly sturdy; I cannot imagine them bending or in anyway becoming damaged. I am sure they will last for a thousand years.
3,Ok,"I would probably not buy these again. They are heavy hooks, can take the weight of anything you put on them, but they will be loose and not always easy to hang your item on."
3,Average,I found the book underwhelming / maybe because the photography was nothing special - for the rest it's a fine coffee table ornament.
3,"Adorable, but wears out QUICKLY","I loved the unique look of these shoes. However, it's best not to consider them as everyday or daycare shoes. The pink paint at the toe began flaking off within a week of everyday wear. I love that they were easy to get on and off, and were a good fit for my daughter's slim foot. Had I paid the full original price I would have given the shoes an even lower review than I have, but since the price was pretty low, I gave them a break."
5,Impressive debut,"Jenna G has been around on the Drum 'N' Bass scene for quite some time so it's good that she's finally brought out an album. And what a collection of producers she's got together to help her out!!Every track on here is great. 'Don't bury me' is her most famous recording. Even though it's my least favourite, i'm not saying i don't like it, it's just every other track on here is even better!Highlights for me are 'Healing', 'Cry Solitaire' and 'Silent Wonder'.If you want a little soul with your DNB, look no further. Jenna delivers. And then some!"
5,This is even better than the original!,"Let me tell you, this has to be one of the coolest products ever on the market. Record 8 internet radio stations at once, then use the additional sound editors to trim them down to your own liking. Very easy to use, and once you have a pile of songs, pick out the ones you want and start burning cds. A great way to collect music and the best part of all is you don't have to pay some lame fee like with iTunes or MusicMatch."
3,Songs blend together and files are truncated,"The Audio Xtract program does exactly what it says it does, but there is a fundamental problem that everyone should be aware of. First, just like on commercial over-the-air radio, the music streams available usually 'blend' together such that one song fades out while the next fades in. This means that your recorded files will seldom have a clean start and beginning. Sometimes, there is even DJ banter that gets captured. The next problem is that the algorithm used to calculate when one song ends and the next starts appears to be imprecise. I've recorded songs that were off by as much as 10 seconds from where they should have started (and ended up having to combine them with adjacent files and re-split them manually). If you're looking for a good way to get radio-ized music, there is no better software than this. However, if you want clean songs with intact lead-ins and endings, you will seldom get that with this product. Sorry!"
1,Make sure you register.....,"After forking over 50 for this garbage, installing and then not using for a while, I was prompted for an ID and pass code. WTF?! I did not spend my cash so I could monkey around with this, especially after tossing everything else..Ahhh, the utter nerve and greed of these companies."
1,No Support,"I have used Audio Extract Pro for several years and found it to be for the most part useful, but recently have had some problems with the manual record function. I have been attempting to contact their tech support for two weeks now and have been completely ignored. Not even an acknowledgment let alone a solution to my problem. I purchased what I thought was a DVD of the new version which finally arrived after several weeks and found that it was a nonfunctional with Vista old version.If you use this you are on your own. Tech support is just place holder on their website."
2,Poorly organized and incomplete,"Only half the book is actually devoted to the collection. The rest of the book is about the history of the Louvre and what's around the Louvre. The maps were so tiny they were about impossible to see, and in some sections were just absent. For instance, the Italian painting section, I could never find a map for and spent a long time wandering about trying to find specific paintings (Titian). Unforunately, there does not seem to be much of an alternative. The limited catalog that they sell there is probably a better option, or the section that most guide books have is probably adequate. The collection is so huge and this book so limited, it was hardly worth even bringing along."
3,A viable alternative,"A viable alternative with good reproductions and complete floor plans would be ""The Louvre (Art & Architecture)"" by Gabriele Bartz and Eberhard Konig, ISBN: 3829026471."
5,The guide with everything in it!,"This guide book is profusely illustrated, well written, and well laid out. It offers good descriptions, rare photographs and picures, behind both the museum, and the principal works within"
5,Surprising great!,"This costume is very well-made and super cute! The pants have slits in the back, about half way up the back of the knees. The top sits above the waist. My child will be wearing a black T-shirt and black leggings under the costume. This will keep her warm and looking modest at the same time. The package has it as ""MEDIUM (USA SIZE 8-10) FOR 5-7 years"". My child is 9, size 10 top and this fits her perfectly."
5,Super cute super large,We bought this puppy for our 3 month old daughter for Christmas. We wanted her to have a special stuffed animal. This is it! It is so large we bought the small one too so she would be able to play with it now. She loves to stare and coo at it when we set it next to her.
5,Gift,"This was a gift for my daughter for christmas. She absolutely loves it. I don't know a lot about the actual material on the disk, but the shipping and packaging were great."
5,Love it!,"This is probably the most politically incorrect anime in existence, making fun of all stereotypes out there for all countries, and for that it is just wonderful. Not an anime to be taken seriously, but more intended for laughs and giggles."
5,Best way to purchase for a Hetalia Fan,This is a good deal for the Hetalia fan or someone interested in learning about Hetalia - which is an animation of charactors that represent countries and teams (Axis Powers and Allied Powers). The kids learn a lot about world history and politics - so it has it's 'educational' benefits : )
3,Okay,Great show but I get so dang tired of the intro and outro songs that play every five minutes... Seriously. EVERY five minutes.
4,hetalia palooza,omgz I was all like YEA :D when I got it. I was a little disappointed to see the box was just a slide thingy. u push it out the movie holding thing. (i fail at reviews) anyway Hetalia is a great series that everyone should see. Just a warning... there is cursing and small nudity. (*cough* *cough* france *cough*) but its no big deal. Buy it today ppl! :3
4,Pretty Good...,"The bearing kits were inexpensive, so I cannot complain much. The packaging was good, but I believe that one had been opened due to a missing pin. It did not create an issue as I had a replacement pin. Installation was drama free with all parts fitting well. Bearings appeared to be of good quality."
5,The oldie but goodie,"This is the book I give people who want to know more about the Silva Method, I've done it for years. Silva is an excellent introduction for all kinds of mind work."
5,One of my favorites,"This book is one of my favorites since I first bought it over 20 years ago. I was introduced to it when I was having serous health issues. The active meditation helped me to steer my thoughts away from fear, and see myself as healthy. It was not magic that gave me my healthy results. It was a combination of many things, starting with changing my thoughts, learning how to treat my life as a miracle itself and the change I made in my actions. Great book that helps you take control of your life. Lots of smart techniques that work."
4,Great book!,I recommend this book. Its great. I gave it 4 stars only because i wish it was a little more detailed from time to time. Besides that the book is super and im going to try the techniques soon! Thanks Jose!
5,The best book Ever,this book will inspire every one from the old to the young. it will show you the power that you have within you. make you think about every action you make and make the right didagin.
4,An easy read but hard to grasp,The first part of this book tells the personal stories of people who use the Silva method in their regular lives. The stories are quite interesting. Then attempts to teach you the method. The book makes it seem much harder then it is. I tried and tried but didn't get it until I took the course. Then everything came together for me. Advice I would give to people trying to learn the method is not to try so hard. It's easier they you think or then the book makes it seem. Just relax and tell yourself you will do it.
3,Fay89,"It's an okay book. i haven't had the experiences that the book claims others have had.... I certainly never MET a COUNSELOR. I realllyyyyyyyyy believed in all of this and thought it would work and thought something was wrong with me so I even paid $400 to go to a real silva session and i can tell u it wasn't worth the money...although my intructor was really really nice...but $400 is wayy too much and i didn't get anything out of the course. anyway, it does have sme inspriational stories."
2,ok,"i thought this book was about how to control other peoples minds but its not it gives you exercies on how to control your mind, not what i was looking for."
5,The best thing that has happened to me,"Well for starters, I must say that I have finally found something that truely works. with this method i feel like i am capable of anything. reed it!!!!!!!!!!! and that's all there is to it."
3,a minoan overview,"this video was good in as far as it went. though not definitive, it provided a lot of information about the minoan civilization. well filmed and nicely narrative, this video is really good for those who have never studied ancient history, for those that have, it is a nice reminder of basic facts and myths."
5,Great for your skin!,I have used this product for several years and my skin now looks better than it did 10 years ago. I have healther looking skin with more even skin tone and firmness.
4,Lightweight moisturizer,"Like the other Derma-e moisturizers I've tried, it only takes a little bit of product, but a lot of blending. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it takes some practice, and moist fingertips.I noticed it leaves an ever so slight pink tint to my makeup. The lavender scent is wonderful, though. It's also helping to smooth the rough facial texture I've been seeing now in my 40's, and seems to brighten my skin. So far, no acne aggravation at all; I love that part. It might not be moisturizing enough for a desert winter (combination skin type), but I'll know in a few months."
5,It works for me,"I have been using this day creme (day and nite) for 2 years. I like the fact that it has no preservatives (which I am allergic to) and has ingredients (starts with pyco...) that reduce wrinkles. It does not have Vit A as I am using it during daytime. I am concern about vit A in day creme which can cause photosensitivity. In general, it is a good product that keeps my skin smooth and subtle. But add-on moisturizer may be needed in very dry and windy days."
2,Thinking of Returning it.,"I'm on my second bottle of derma e night cream. Love its moisturizing effect on my skin. But my first experience with derma e age-defying day creme is disappointing. It just kind of lays on top of the skin, doesn't hydrate. Don't even try and put makeup on over it - terrible, rough-feeling base. Accentuates wrinkles instead of moisturizing them. At $25 for 2 oz it's not cheap. I'm hoping I can return it."
2,The Rocking Back and Forth is Distracting and Annoying!,"I thought this would be a great bike for me. However, the bike continously rocks back and forth! It is so annoying and uncomfortable, that I just stopped using it!I should have know better I guess. I don't even believe the rocking does anything for your workout. All it does is go back and forth and I don't feel any more resistance."
5,Life-Changing,"When I read this book I was skeptical of the Christian faith, but a friend gave it to me and it answered the most important questions I had about life. After reading it, I was encouraged to read the Bible for myself and understand exactly what Jesus Christ had accomplished for me. After reading this and the Bible I became a Christian. Those things being said, you can guess that this was a very helpful book for me."
1,"Give me the answer sir, I can't figure it out myself.","Highly recommended for those people whose convictions are not swayed by things like evidence and logic. This book is ideal for those who simply desire to maintain and defend their Christian beliefs at all costs with sophistry and/or other pseudo-rational means.Not recommended for those who seek honest answers to the deepest philosophical questions facing humanity. Actually, this book may have some value as a primer in the pitfalls of non-rational thinking styles such as circular reasoning, mistaking wishful thinking for logic, and confusing emotional intuition for evidence."
3,Kindle edition doesn't have linked footnotes,"The content of this book is fascinating, but I wanted to lodge a protest about the formatting of the kindle edition -- the footnotes/endnotes aren't hyperlinked. For a scholarly book like this with many, many footnotes, that's not good enough."
1,"yeahh, sure...","Yes, Bible has special place in history and this special I expected from commentators. After all Christianity claim leadership over humanity and ignore the any deviations. I dont belong to any particular religion and consume anything. Unfortunately there are nothing to consume from this book. The main point is the author not consider reality important as any religion have to survive in reality. Endless empty talking, never mentioning why Christianity split in factions, why the fight each other etc. On a top author behave like Jews never existed and their religion disappeared too which is quite opposite of reality. Etc."
3,"Fun romance, if somewhat over the top.","This often how I pictured my dates would have turned out. But, none such was the case, and never will be at this point.""Cross My Heart"" is a fun little film that has some moments of unbelievability, but also a lot of ""1980s""-ness going for it as well. I don't have too much to say about it. Supposed third date jitters are the topic of this flick, as well as the veil of secrecy that both man and woman put up to impress the other.It's warm hearted and well meant. Me, I never thought anyone would be daring to show dating on such an intimate level and with a name cast, but I guess it had to happen at some time.Fun 80's stuff for those who were 20-somethings or 30-somethings during that time. Keep in mind the film's rating if you want to watch it with company."
3,Engaging Enough B Movie,"""Cross My Heart"" is an unpretentious and often humorous depiction of misrepresentation as an all too common part of dating. Though often a bit silly and unbelievable, it's nonetheless worth seeing."
3,Good Movie,I Liked it very much and added it to my DVD collection.Got it for my sister but enjoyed the movie as well.
3,If She Should Die,"A good, solid mystery. The characters are well developed and the tone of the book is good. You won't automatically figure out the guilty party, since the person seems to be pulled out of nowhere, but it is still a pleasant read."
3,"Mediocre at first, then getting better","I liked 8 or 9 of Carlene Thompsons novels. Was really disappointed with ""If you ever tell"" and ""Since you've been gone"", found both books very confusing with too many characters.If you want to give Thompson a chance, start with ""All fall down"". I think it's even better than her first book ""Black for Remembrance"", because it creates such a great atmosphere.""The way you look tonight"" and ""In the Event of my Death"" are excellent.""Don't close your eyes"" is very well written.""If she should die"" has a very slow beginning, but after almost 100 pages it picks up and develops a humorous relationship between the main character, Christine Ireland, and the new sheriff which really cracked me up.""Last Whisper"" was very thrilling and recommendable.""Share no Secrets"" and ""Last seen alive"" are not bad, but not among her better ones.I still need to read ""You can run"", so I cannot say anything about that one."
5,If You Like Mysteries . . .,"I read lots of mysteries, but most of them I have figured out about halfway through. Not this one, though. There were lots of suspects, and one of the scariest murder scenes I ever read. Thompson tied up all the loose ends with a fast paced, scary conclusion. This book stayed on my mind for days. I highly recommend it."
1,Worst Of Carlene,"I have read all of Ms.Thompson's books and this is the worst. It was boring and hard to stay interested from the beginning. I waited a year for this book to come out and was sorely disappointed. If I wait a year for the next one, I hope it isn't a waste of my time."
3,Not the best CT I've read...,"This book was mediocre--not great, but not a terrible read either. I'm not sure if it's because I've read so many CT books that I'm ""use"" to her plots and character descriptions (making it sometimes easy to spot the ""killer"") or if this is just not one of her best works. I really wasn't impressed with her take on the ""mentally challenged"" character either. She seemed to make him too smart at times and then, as if catching herself, had him revert back to being a 7 year old.If you can find this book used, I wouldn't NOT read it, but I certainly wouldn't buy it new. Better yet, get it from the library! Oh, and please, don't make this the first CT book you read."
2,Too tight bathing Cap!,I bought this to give me a little protection to limit water in my ear in my ear. I couldn't even get this cap CLOSE to the opening of my ear. Had cap on 2 minutes (in the house) and started to get a head ache. I will give this to a child when the summer bathing season starts. NOT HAPPY!!
2,Not for big or curly hair,"Ouch! I could not get this cap to stay on without rolling up, popping off my head and snagging my curls in the process. VERY hard to stretch to get it set right. Hurt to put on, hurt to take off. If you have very short hair or straight hair, it might be fine. Not for me."
5,Basic is right. Just what I ordered.,Needed something small to bake in a smaller convection oven. This gets the job done.
4,love it or hate it,non stick is its best quality. durability is another. if the baked item is on the sloppy side the cleanup is questionable.
4,Firesign review,"If you liked the album ""Shakespeare's Lost Comedie"" you'll like this CD: it's the ""full"" version with content that wasn't on the LP.If you don't know Firesign Theatre, this wouldn't be the first one I'd buy, simply because it's so dense--it's a fantastic CD, but it helps if you know your Shakespeare and have a lot of patience. The runs of puns are brilliant."
4,A more mature Marcinko means VVM (very verbose meanderings),"For perspective, I must not only admit that I eagerly await each Rogue Warrior novel but that I purchase them all - in hardback. Yet sadly, there seems to be a definate trend away from Marcinko's original mix of: meaningful action; interesting and unusual equipment and techniques; and enticingly well-developed characters found in his first books. S.F. Alpha - though entirely readable and occasionally exciting - nearly killed my enthusiasm with condescending footnotes (more than 70 of them) and AIDOA (an incessant diarrhea of acronyms). The new 'stuff' and new characters in S.F. Alpha are too thinly developed to hook the reader or pain him when they fail/break/die. I look forwad to Seal Force Puce hoping that the mix will be more toward the unique people who are the operators, the equipment that they use and their incredible bonds. Plus frequent rockin' & rollin'. I will, of course, buy it - in hardback."
1,Another cheap Mac Bolan type book,"Demo Dick Vietnam Sharkman, is a lousy writer. True he has lived the life and even in this book, you get a few juicy bits of how covert operations are carried out. Lets face it, Demo Dick is a has been, who constantly anchors down on Bombay Gin. A few years ago, I saw him on NBC news mouthing off about how he could poison Saddam Hussein. Well Dickey, Saddam is still alive. If you are the real man you claim to be, Daniel Boone, sobber up and go get him!"
2,A big drop in quality.,"I loved the first Rogue Warrior. Both of Marcinko's business books were excellent, though one was enough). Red Cell was pretty good, but after that they began declining in quality. I mean, there is the obvious formula to his books (which a commentor below mentions, it's amazing how he can never parachute out of a plane without something going wrong with his chute. I mean, I understand that things go wrong, but every time? And the things the character Marcinko does, I mean, there is no way that he would get away with it that many times. I respect Marcinko for who he is and what he has done, but I think he and Weisman need to get together and change things up for the next installment, or maybe write something different (i know i'd like to see more nonficiton like Rogue Warrior)."
4,He Loves To Shoot and Loot And It Shows,"Another review mentioned that Richard Marchinko uses the same formula in all of his novels. I agree--and that's part of what makes his books so much fun to read. These are action novels where you'll actually learn something if you are willing to pay attention, as well as fun examples of what we'd all love to do to the people who give us orders and have no earthly idea what they're talking about (no, not kill them--the former SEAL saves that for terrorists and traitors--but expose their stupidity and embarrass them). Any RM book has colorful characters, more real life resonance than any Dale Brown tome, tons of acronyms, a few huge plausibility leaps, and the idea that viewers will take in all these items and enjoy the ride. Mission Accomplished. 4/5."
3,"Good read, but was not as satisfying as previous books.","The Marcinko Rogue Warrior books are still entertaining and enlightening reads. However, the books lately (including Boehm's, SFA, Option Delta, and the Real Team) use fewer words and less meat throughout. At this point, I'd rather find the books at a used book store than purchase them new. Come on, Dick! Your first three books knocked me over!! After I read the book, it circulates among my family members (over 62 at last count). We enjoy your adventures vicariously and will continue to do so. We all anxiously await your next adventure!"
5,The Rogue Warrior satisfies yet again!,"Seal Force Alpha starts right in on the action and keeps a constant pace till the last scene. Marcinko's style, as always, entertains you and gives you the real life grit of a warrior's life. The story was very plausible, as always, and makes you wonder what we ever did without the great Rogue Warrior. A definite Spec War fan pleaser. If you are not a fan of this series yet, by the end of this Marcinko narrative you will be."
3,Only Ok,"This is an easy going mystrey novel, not to taxing on the mind. However, it does get annoying with the constant referrals to Mr Parageter and his associates. Very repetitive."
4,Complete chair workout at an even pace,"This is a no-frills production that features on the good side a surprise light jazz soundtrack instead of the usual New Age fare. On the down side, there is only one camera angle and few close-ups where they are needed and there is limited navigation on the individual segments. Overall, though, is this a pretty decent production and offers an excellent 60-minute workout.If you are in reasonably good condition, Level 3 would provide a relaxing and effective workout for days when you want something more slow and simple. Most poses are done seated with a few standing poses also done with the aid of a chair.Patricia is a good instructor with a pleasant, lilting voice. She works systematically and offers brief relaxation/meditation breaks with each segment.I particularly like her version of chair corpse pose."
2,Definetly not worth the cost.,"While it does have a number of good photos, it has a number of glaring historical errors. In addition half the book is about modern cruise ships and cruising. The stuff about the liners is basic and can be found in many books for far less $. Again, lots of good photos, but not worth the high price."
1,Misleading Title,"This book is not, as I had hoped, the third installment of this beloved series. Instead, Amazon is trying to rip you off by labeling it so. The book is, in fact, the 1st book, Tricksters Choice, and the 2nd, Tricksters Queen, compiled into one novel. Do not buy this book. If I could, I would rate it a ZERO!"
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE ALREADY READ TRICKSTERS CHOICE!!!,It is just books 1 and 2 of the Daughter of Alanna series complied into one book. This is not a sequel!
2,Not the same,"I bought this thinking since it said 3, it would be number three in the series, but no, there is no reason for that three! Its only one and two in one book. It needs to be changed so that people know what they're getting."
4,tamora pierce's books,"people, THIS BOOK IS TWO BOOKS IN ONE!!!!!! the original two are good. they continue the life within the world of tortall, but in another country!!!it also gives info with the other charaters from the other books, so read ALL of the other sets before reading this please! oh and here they are in order:The Lionness series (4 books),The Immortals Series (4 books),The Protector of the Small series (4 books),those are the series before the trickesters series.*** if i forgot any, (i don't think i did) please tell me!***"
1,What???,"I have not actually read the book, but I have read Trickster's Choice and Trickster's Queen. The summary of this book is the summary of Trickster's Choice(daughter of the lioness, book 1).Furthormore, Tamora Pierce does NOT have this new book on her official website, therefore this is not a real book.PS The book Tricksters I give a 0 stars rating. I give the book Trickster's Choice a 4 1/2 star rating."
2,Did not care for,"This group was recommended to me by a professional jazz musician. Personally it was not my style. Too abrasive, not melodic enough, and too much improv. I guess i like my jazz with a little more structure. DJ"
5,Just what I needed,I had been looking for a book that allowed me to understand the process I was about to undergo as well as give me emotional support. This book was wonderful! Really just what I needed to ease my fears and make me feel like I was not alone. It is positive and practical. THANK YOU!!!!!
2,Very disappointed! Only for complete IF novices.,"Very little helpful, detailed information. Its a tiny book, and most of what is covered is covered by any IVF center's literature.Don't waste your money."
1,Not worth it,"This is not a book, it's a 60 page borchure about IVF. There is no info in it that can not be found on the internet. Simply: DO NOT PAY MONEY FOR THIS!"
2,Careful:many errors,"Here are just two examples, both from the same page (!) 123:""But during 1932...Adolf Hitler its Fuehrer was named chancellor"": it was 1933!!""Nineteen Twenty Eight was the year of the Nazi Putsch"": it was 1923!!So if you buy this book, you will have to limit yourself to the photos and disregard the legends and the text. I regret the $20 I spent on it."
2,"OK, but with a liberal bias","I should have none that when Wolf Blitzer gives a foreward this book is going to lean a little to the left. Good acounts of WW1 and 2. But like the typical liberal this book only shows the negative accounts of US involvement. Even goes so far as to suggest that there no mass killings in Bosnia and Serbs were only fleeing the US bombing. Guess the killing and Rapes by Milosovich's army had nothing to do with it. At least its left out of the book. Book is also way to soft on Saddam, practically saying the US picked the entire fight. Basically portrays 20th century US as a big war monger without any justification. Typical liberal regurgitation."
1,Left slant,"I agree with the other review above. I purchased this book as a gift for my boyfriend. I had not read untill just resently for a school project. Had I known the liberal slant that this book portrays, I would not have purchased it. It seems like the soliers are seen as evil instead of honorable. This is a real anti-war book."
2,If it's doesn't flow naturally then it not meant to be,"Not every relationship has a story and this book is proof of that. I like her writing but this story is just...no. It's just no. It's so...unrealistic and coincidental. [...]it up and get together already. You either want to be with each other or you. You don't have to make it something it's not. It just seems like the author was trying entirely too hard on this ""love story""."
4,Excellente',"This book was excellent!!! I loved how Mrs. Schuster writes with such vivid imagery and her characters are so real, its incredible; her stories create magic within the readers heart. This book is a must read!!!"
3,An OK read!,This story would have been better if I had read other installments featuring the Deveraux's and Cohrans. Once I got past the first few chapters the story took off and became more interesting.
1,Dull Read...,"This book was utterly BORING!!!I had to literally force myself to finish reading it. It never even held my attention, and it simply started out lame.Paris is supposed to be 29-years-old woman, that's a joke, because she's behaves like a teenager throughout the entire story.The dialogue was mediocre. I could never develop a mental picture of the imagery.This is definitely my first and last time reading a Melanie Schuster book. Buying, this story was a waste of money!!!"
3,When will they ever learn?,More action packed chapters as the good guys consistently insist on being out numbered in fisticuffs and get the snot beat out of them every time; when will they ever learn? And we know why; if you listen closely you will recognize Clayton Moore (alias The Lone Ranger) with out his mask. Still they are persistent. Will it pay off and can Commando Cody save the day or will the bad moon leader Retik rule the Earth?
4,clown costume,"This costume was super cute on my son. The only thing I would note about it was that after he wore it only an hour all the the puff balls that go down the middle of the costume fell off.it did not come with the wig,but a little hat.Over all,I was still pleased with it.He was very cute in it."
4,Great kid custome,My son had it for Halloween. It was worth the price although it is cheaply put together and probably would not survive one more trick or treating trip. But I was happy with it and my boy had a great time.
2,Cheaply Made,"Very Cheaply made, didn't even make it through the night with a 2-year old. Balls fell off before leaving the house."
3,good deal,"good generic costume... you get what you pay for, not a SUPER costume, but it will last for school program and a year of dress up fun"
4,Great costume for 3 year old!,"My three year old daughter decided she wanted to be a clown for Halloween. I ordered this costume and it was perfect! A one piece, adorable costume that fit over jeans and a fleece sweatshirt so she was warm enough while trick or treating. It seems durable enough for what it is - just an inexpensive costume. Since the price was right, I am satisfied and didn't expect something that would last forever. I would say that Amazon should point out more clearly that the wig is not included. I was able to get the wig for under $5, but didn't notice the small print that it was not part of the package.Bottom line: Excellent, adorable, well fitting costume for my daughter - I would definitely buy it again!"
5,"Great, reliable system. Awesome sound quality!","We have had this system for over four years now, and couldn't be happier with it's performance. The combination of tower speakers, surrounds and subwoofer deliver great sound quality for both Movies and Music. We had gotten a four year extended warranty, but never ended up needing it, as the system has worked flawlessly so far (touch wood)."
2,Lessons learned,"Well, we've owned this system for over a year now. I was a little disappointed in sound quality and picture quality right out of the box. After playing with the settings, I was able to get some improvement but still not completely satisfied. We still have problems with the dynamic range as volumes go from quiet to loud and vice versa. Dialogue quality still falls somewhat short.Now for the gripe! For the past 3 months the dvd player would go on the fritz. We would be comfy, watching a movie when all of a sudden, the dvd would stop and the player would turn off an on. The behaviour is sporadic and may happen right off the bat or after watching a movie and moving on to special dvd features. Must be a short circuit somewhere. Annoying as heck!I'm not going to bother with repairing the thing. I'm moving on to bigger and better things.Hope this helps!"
1,One of the Worst Home theater - Don't buy panasonic,"Hi we purchased this unit in April, 2005 for almost over $400.00. This unit didn't had reviewed by then. We thought since we are putting good money we get a pretty decent system but the performance is not what we expected.It can't play DVDs for more than 2 or 3 hours. After that it continually tries to read but unsuccessful. Please don't buy this unit at all. Try looking for a SONY or BOSE if you can afford.Lesson learned is beware what you buy and let others write review about the unit then you buy.Thanks."
1,Too much money to charge for this MOVIE,"I understand people want to make money on here by selling. I really think it is wrong to hike up the cost of this movie. Especially when it was available online at other popular retail chains for under $8.00. Children love this old movie, but I think it's a rip off to buy on here.To Grandmother's House We Go"
3,Thank you,I have send this back because I did not realise it was Spanish it was a good price English are over price
1,bad condition,"for being expensive, the dvd case was broken and the dvd had a lot of scratches on it but i bought it supposedly new. if i pay extra for the new one then it should not have any scratches and the casde should not be broke"
5,TO GRANDMOTHER`S HOUSE WE GO,"This movie is about two twin girls Sarah and Julie Thompson.They runaway on Christmas because their mom said they were a handful. That is why they ran away to their Grandma Mimi`s house.They hid in their mom`s friend Eddie`s truck to get to grandma`s house.While their in his truck Sarah has to go to the bathroom so Eddie took them to a resterant so Sarah could go to the bathroom after they dilivered packages because Eddie is a dilivery man the twins got some money they went for Ice cream and got a lottery ticket. Then he tries taking them home but someone kidnaps them.At the end they go to grandma Mimi`s carnival, win the lottery andgo to grandma Mimi`s altogether. Well I don`t want to give to much away it`s an exelent movie."
3,Cute for kids,"This is a cute movie. The Olsen twins are impossibly cute, even cuter than Michelle inFull House. However, ""To Grandmother's House We Go"" certainly is more appropriate for kids. The movie does get silly at some points and I think many adults would grow bored watching the Olsen twins over and over."
5,KIDS LOVE THIS MOVIE !!!,This is a really cute movie. My 4 year old girl and my 7 year old boy both like it. It has just enough adventure and funny stuff that even he thinks its cool. Any MK and Ashley fan will love it.
2,Combination mechanism isn't very accurate,"The lock seems sturdy enough, but the combination recognition isn't very accurate. For example, if I set my combination to 2-4-8-4, the lock will also accept 2-3-8-3 and 2-4-8-3. Regardless, I'm sure it would discourage casual petty theft as any person truly determined to get your stuff would probably just use a bolt cutter anyways."
3,"Sturdy lock, but difficult to use","I haven't had the chance to actually use the lock yet, so far I only had time to set the combination of the lock, and tried it out couple of times. The lock seems pretty sturdy, however, the numeric pad is a little difficult to turn, which makes unlocking a little difficult. (which could be a good thing I guess) Also, even at the right combination, I have to have both hand on the lock, push and pull the lock really hard for couple of times before I can actually open the lock. Can't imagine what I'll do if it's actually on a locker and I can't get both hand on the lock, but perhaps a little WD40 will help?? Again, this could be a feature that makes lock more secure by making it harder to unlock I guess..."
4,Does the job,"The mechanism on this is a bit sloppy, possibly making it easier to guess the combination, but I'm not locking up the crown jewels, so I'm not really worried. It's easy to set the combination with the included ""key""."
4,Master lock is quality,"There are cheaper locks out there, but they are a lot less than Master Locks. I got the best price for this at Amazon. The home improvement stores are substantially more money for the same product."
2,Does not fit a standard gym locker,"Pros:This lock feels nice, heavy, and durable.Cons:This lock does not fit a standard gym locker (the shackle is too thick).The combination keys are, well, shaky. It is hard to describe, but as you turn one of the four numbers, the neighboring ones move as well. In this way, it feels quite cheap.Since this does not fit a gym locker, it has become a paper weight."
2,I Love Amazon But. . .,This is the worst lock ever. Its not Amazon's fault though its Master-lock's fault. Unless you have 15 minutes to input the combination 15 times do not buy this lock. This is actually the first product that Ive bought that I actually didn't like. I assumed buying a name brand lock would eliminate any worries of a faulty product but I was jipped. :-(
4,Hefty & sturdy,One of the best things about it is that it stands out among all the silver lockers in the locker room. The worst thing is how easily the paint came off (but a another coat and a sealer can take care of that).
2,Broke on second use,"This is the second time I've had a Master Lock of this style fail on me. On only the second use, the lock became stuck open and would not latch. I could not get the shackle to engage, and tried everything to get it to work. Sent it back for a refund and picked up one of these:Master Lock 1534D Password Plus Combo Lock in Black, Blue, Red, White, Colors may Vary, 1-Packat the hardware store, which has been just fine.I bought this to use on a gym locker, and it was a good size, shape, and strength for that purpose; so is the replacement lock I bought."
1,Useless piece of Junk,"Bought 4 of these so we can have 1 combo on shed - garage & toolchest, within a week 1st one failed refusing to lock no matter what we did. Yesterday, while standing in over a foot of snow, another one refused to open thus leaving me to go find a boltcutter or to shovel 2 driveways for our multi-family homes. Master Lock used to be a good name sadly, I finally put back on the 2 Job Lot cheapo locks that have been on for years & worked just fine. Don't waste your money on these !"
1,Lock fail,"At first this seemed like a high quality lock. I bought it for the gym. It is nice and heavy, with an attractive black finish. I successfully set my combination, used it at the gym, and all was good. One week later, when I went to use it at the gym again, it wouldn't close. No amount of fiddling with it (with the combo set to ""open"" or locked) could fix it. I tried to find the ""key"" that came with it that allows you to reset it (though I'm not sure that would have helped), but I had misplaced it. I really want to return it, but it is not worth the return postage. Despite the convenience of a dial combo, I'd be tempted to replace it with a keyed padlock. Anyway, while appearing to be of good quality, it failed after the second use. Into the trash it goes."
1,Garbage,My fiancee bought the lock for me and I set it on the way to the gym and tested it...no problems. Then I got to the gym and it wouldn't depress in the shackle and lock. No matter when I did. I spent 10 minutes playing with it and trying to reset it. Still won't work. I'm not happy.
5,The nobility of losers,"I had read, before starting this novel, that Lao She was influenced by Dickens. Perhaps he was, but this novel is not as much reminiscent of Dickens as of Zola at his bleakest, or of Frank Norris' McTeague.Just like McTeague (Norris' San Francisco unlicensed dentist), Hsiang Tzu is an inarticulate man.The greatness of Lao She or Frank Norris' writing is that they allow us to get inside men who are so out of touch with their own feelings. Not mockingly or judging them in any way. Just deeeeeply.It is difficult to be a man. One would almost think it has become more so, as men now are expected to be strong but caring too. But exceptional novels like Rickshaw or McTeague show that even in previous societies, with different challenges, men were already ravaged by inner contradictions.Of course, the description of early 20th century Peking is fascinating, as are the omens of revolution.But what made the book a special experience for me is the psychological accuracy."
5,Must read for those searching for meaning...,"I first read this book in a Chinese Literature class ten yearsago. I enjoyed it then, but only now after a second reading did Ireally savour it. Lao She tells the story of how a society based on survival of the (financially) fittest turns many ""ambitious"" citizens back into animals with no need of a mind or heart left. Lao She does not portray them as victims but products of a society based on ""individualism"". Seems one could compare the USA of 2000 (where school boys kill each other for mass marketed tennis shoes and school girls starve themselves to death for media illusions of beauty) with the Peking of 1920 we just have more wealth to pay with. This is not a fairy tale, but dark reality as the truth often is :-)"
4,top quality foundation,"glominerals is very good quality foundation and looks v smooth and well on. however, there was a delay in the delivery and i was offered a free gift if i waited, which i did but i never got it:("
5,love this stuff,"This is the easiest, most natural looking foundation I have ever used. I used to use the bare minerals line, but have switched to this as it is less messy for travel and I think the finish is more natural looking."
2,Great Product,When I opened the compact the sponge that was used to replace the GloMinerals pad had a strong chemical smell and the makeup had a rancid odor. I threw the sponge away and kept the compact open to air out and the rancid odor went away. I use the pad from my old compact which I had purchased at a local store that had included the GloMinerals pad. The makeup itself is great.
4,great makeup,"I like glo minerals because it does not sink into lines, it evens out my skin tone and it gives me a slight glo that does not accentuate wrinkls."
4,Wonderful product!,"This base actually calms down my rosacea-prone skin and covers all of the redness with out looking cakey or having to apply a bunch of products. The zinc in the base helps my skin feel better and look less red. This one base has replaced 3 other products--concealer, foudation and powder--I used to use to do the same thing. I was amazed at how little time it took to apply. I love this product!"
3,Imitation,"I realized after I placed this order that this is an imitation. If you read the ingredients closely, you will see that it is NOT the same as the real thing. I thought well maybe it doesn't make a difference. Well, it did. It did not work as well when you use the real thing. It's OK, not great."
4,Better than Bare Escentuals,"I have been using mineral makeup for the past 4 years. I used to use Bare Escentuals, but never felt like I got the coverage I needed and I always felt oily. Since changing to Glo, my oiliness is much less noticable and it give fantastic natural looking coverage. Love it!"
5,Best powder around!,My favorite thing about the gloMinerals powder is that I don't have to wear liquid base anymore. The powder has great coverage and evens out my skin tone. Excellent product!
2,"Love glominerals pressed base, but this product wasn't up to par.","I love glominerals makeup but I'm not sure what's up with some products that come from unapproved vendors. Of course, glominerals warns the public against ordering from unauthorized places, for various reasons that you can look on their website, but I took a chance because I was in a bind and needed some quickly (thanks Amazon for that). With this specific experience, after the third day, I opened the compact to see that all the pressed base was a crumbly mess. Fortunately, I had a backup mineral foundation container that I was able to pour it all in to. Whew! Lost a little in the process but at least it wasn't a total loss. I still love, love, love glominerals pressed base but something is honestly up with this product that was supplied by an unauthorized vendor. Can't put my finger on it but this was a lesson learned."
3,Beautiful voice!,"I do love her voice and there were stand out songs but unfortunately these were few. It is enough, however, to make me want to hear more!"
1,Terrible read...,So let's see...a fake autobiography about a woman hobo concerned with women hobo issues...written by a man. Poorly written at that. Also...for a 'sister of the road' this character is almost never on the road and tells almost no road stories. So lame.
1,A fun story but a misleading book with a miserable ending,"This book is purported to be an autobiography, but is instead a fiction novel of radical propoganda written, not by a woman on the fringe of society, but a man writing from a viewpoint comfortably within the activist culture of the time. The political purposes of the story are undone by an ending that serves to reinforce the very societal values that the rest of the novel seems to rally against. The sort of person who would be attracted to this book is likely to find this very obvious, frustrating, and unsatifying."
1,Very difficult to read,"The device is very difficult to read. In low light levels (like any time the sun is down) it is totally useless, even using a flashlight to see the display doesn't help. During daylight if the background is against grass not much better. It must be against a light background to be readable, but even then only in daylight."
2,Hard to Read at Times,"This is a decent, small thermometer that sticks to the opposite of a window, and it seems reasonably accurate, although I've never compared its readings to another thermometer.The difficulty is that the thermometer is difficult to read in two situations:1. If it's dark outside, there's no contrast between the black numbers and the black (dark) background.2. If any of the digits contains a 4 or a 9, as these two digits look very similar.Also, the suction cup is off-center a bit, so the longer, heavier end can tilt down a bit, requiring correction if you happen to like a level look."
2,"Nice design, needs to be returned","I like the design of this thermometer, very cost effective compared to wireless units. The first one I got said it was about 45 degrees outside when it was actually in the 80's. Luckily I got that one at a local retailer."
1,Failed in <2 years,"This is a poorly made, mediocre product that failed in less than two years. The LCD screen started leaking internally on its own and it is essentially useable now. It is currently displaying 97F when it is really 35F outside!Speaking of temperatures, it is not very accurate either. A ~2 dollar Chinese made LCD thermometer I bought off e bay displayed an exact temperature match to weather (dot) com. As another note, when the unit was actually still useable, it was very difficult to read the display in sunlight.Bottom line is, save you good money and buy a cheap, Chinese made no-name e bay unit instead. Not only is it more functional, it is more accurate as well."
4,Digital Stick-On Thermometer,"I sent this thermometer as a gift to my mother. It arrived promptly but came with NO instructions. She thought it was broken, registering ""70 degrees"" all day long until I told her to peel off the plastic display piece and turn the unit to ""on"". Additionally, I would recommend a velcro or sticky tape fastener instead of the suction cup. The unit works fine and is easy to read."
1,boring,"I love feminazi books but this one just loads you up on dates and names. I had to read it for a class, otherwise I would've pitched it after the first chapter."
3,"Fun ""fan fic""","As an avid lover of the American Civil War, U S Grant has become my most esteemed Civil War personality after President Lincoln. Of the many biographies of Grant, I believe I have read them all and sometimes more than once. It was a curious surprise to see Grant in fiction as a detective-type and I simply had to read this book. The author knows Grant well, and although he portrays him as somewhat inept, Julia Grant is portrayed as a strong, steady, and admirable help meet, although very ambitious.I enjoyed this book enough to purchase two more by the same author. This is lighthearted historical fiction."
3,A Good Soldier,"U.S. Grant stops in Bethel, Ohio on his way to Cincinnati for an overnight stay to discover that his host has passed away. While paying his respects to the widow, another former schoolmate offers his home to the Grant family.While getting ready for the night Grant's young son, Jess shows his parents the toy coins that his new friends gave him. Only these are not toy coins, they are real gold. Grant tries to return the coins to the widow, but she denies they are hers.Where did the gold come from? How did Grant's school friend die? Why do the four Andersonville survivors have such opulent homes and belongings?"
2,A Good Soldier,"Not impressed with this one ,a weak plot with the story dragging along. Maybe it was due to the period it was set in, not my cup of tea"
1,"A Good Soldier Indeed, But a Lousy Novel","My review of Marks' previous Grant mystery, ""The Ambush of My Name,"" applies fully to this lame sequel, (if you've read one of these books, you've truly read them all,) so rather than repeat myself, I shall just say that this is not only one of the worst fictional portrayals of Grant and his wife, Julia, that I have ever read, but it's a truly feeble detective yarn, to boot. I wish like crazy that Marks would either educate himself about the real Grants before he attempts another book in this series, or forget about USG altogether and turn to mangling the life of Franklin Pierce or Millard Fillmore or anyone else he pleases and leave poor Ulys alone."
4,Tell Me Why?,"I was very pleased with the product, which was clean and in good conditon even though it was a used book. The seller was very honest in her description of this product, and responsive to the order. It was a very smooth transaction."
1,"Terrible Book, DON'T WASTE your money","Like other people have said, this book is not worth the money. This book puts far too much emphasis on some topics, ignores others and simply does a terrible job explaining biochemical concepts that are important in medicine. If you would like a simplified biochemistry text, choose Lippencott's or Lange's texts. This is book is too simple and frustrating. I have spoken with many students in my medical school class that agree with my assessment and do no even bother reading the chapters because they leave them confused and frustrated. Save your money!!! I wish I could give it a negative star or no stars at all!"
2,Lacking in detail,"This book was the required book for my Medical Biochemistry class. Which was quite strange because none of the professors lectured from it, choosing instead Lehninger or Harper's. This book was so lacking in actual biochemistry that it was essentially useless for adequately covering the course material. I will admit that it does a pretty good job of covering clinical correlations, it has a lot of pretty charts, tables, figures, and pictures in multiple colors but it does not cover the material adequately. Do yourself a big favor and go with Lehninger or Harper's instead."
1,Hard going,"This text was compulsory for our college. As a new student to biochemistry I really struggled with this book. It made easy concepts complicated. If you're planning to do a couple of years of biochem then this is the book for you. If you're after some intro stuff, invest your money into something else."
1,discontinued - new version worthless,Master told me I was at fault when the new version of this lock failed to open after two weeks. Reason? Because I bought their inexpensive lock!!
2,Misleading Picture,"I received a great lock, but it did not match the simpler lock I thought I was buying. I wanted a lock with only four characters and instead got one with five. While this is all well and good, I chose a dealer whose lock was more expensive than other dealers thinking I was getting a four-character lock. Had I known, I would have chosen a dealer with a lower price. Fix your picture - it is deceptive."
3,"Easy to use, easy to defeat","This is a great lock if you want a quick, easy to use lock that keeps honest people honest. But in terms of security, it's a complete joke. The system operates using plastic dials that are fitted over metal tumblers. The plastic dials hold letters or numbers, and give the ability to personalize the code. But -- they are made of plastic. Anyone with any tool and two or three spare minutes can open the lock.I use these to secure things that don't really need to be secured, but that I want to keep closed. Keeps my diaries and so forth away from my kids' eyes. If the lock is smashed... I'll know it. But I wouldn't use it to secure anything in a public place."
3,"Thanks for Internet techniques, not for Visual Basic 4.0","I read this book a few months ago. To be honest, I've learned a lot about Internet protocols so 8 should be the rate. BUT ! Please do not intitulate a book ""Visual Basic 4.0..."" when all code samples are written in VB3.0. Classes in VB4 could have been a great help to encapsulate code to manipulate Sockets, POP3, SMTP, etc..."
1,Good but misleading,"Carl Franklin is an outstanding writer and speaker. His book is very informative, but it requires third-party tools to access the Internet and doesn't give you much ""how does it work"" information.Visual Basic really isn't the right language for Internet programming, anyway, but if you're in need of writing tools for your own (or company) use, this is not a bad buy."
2,a waste of money,this book gives you a shareware 3rd party control to do all internet access with .... it teaches nothing about winsock and how to use it just how to use this 3rd party control.... if i had know this ahead of time i would not have wasted my money
4,Good book with one caveat,"My primary interest in buying this book was to learn how to write an effective FTP application for my personal use at home and work. I found the material to be clearly presented and the sample FTP program functional. To his credit, the author also supports fixes to the code on his web page. However, the book relies on the use of a custom control for Winsock which, although supplied in demo form on the accompaning CD-ROM, costs an additional $99 dollars if you really want to write any code for distribution. The author states that VB will be too slow to use without that custom control. The problem is that I would have preferred to learn stand-alone code at this point rather than depend on that control. If I had known I would be so dependant on it, I would have rather spent the money on a licensed copy of WS_FTP"
1,Really Poor Quality,"I use this product as an intake for my computer. The vent cover is curved, off-color, and ugly. It took about 2 weeks for the fans to start malfunctioning. Now on the left, I have a fan that squeals non-stop, in the middle a fan that barley works, and the right that works perfectly. After installing this item, I saw no difference in temperature."
2,Way too loud,"Although it is functional, the unit I received is way too loud. I wish I was kidding when I compare it to a salon hair dryer. It makes more noise than the entire rest of the PC. I bought it to provide some additional flow-through air for my case (not as a hard drive cooler specifically), and I couldn't live with it as loud as it was.I wired in a potentiometer to adjust the voltage to the fan trio, hoping to dull the noise, and it only changed the pitch, not really the volume. I also disconnected the fans one by one and discovered that 2 of the 3 were significantly louder than the other. I now am running just 1 fan in the group of 3. I made the decision to keep and rewire the unit rather than send it back for a refund at this price point. My CPU temps, which were of the utmost concern, may have been reduced by 1-2 deg C. when all 3 fans were working. I know my power supply is getting more cool air, however."
2,Ugh,"So I have a SYX by SysteMAX, which is a pretty standard mid-tower case. These things do not fit, but I really liked the idea, so a couple of zip ties did the job. Took about an hour to figure out that the bracket it came with was completely useless, and you have to kind of squeeze it into place. There is a noise difference as well, GPU temps did not drop at all but I'm seeing about 5 degrees F lower on my CPU. All in all, would I buy these again? Not unless it was a seamless install... Pretty dissatisfied but w/e more air flow through my machine."
3,"Gets the job done, but doesn't ""fit"" my CoolerMaster case","It contributed about a 4 degree (Celsius) drop on my CPU temp, but it's sort of just jammed into the bay instead of fitting right. The face plate has an edge that sticks out, and that's going to prevent it from fitting a lot of cases."
3,Did not receive this exact backpack- got one similiar,"I ordered this particular backpack because I liked the way it looked. I wanted the backpack shown in the picture, which I did not get. I got a princess backpack that was similiar. I am keeping the backpack I received to avoid the hassle of sending it back. But, when I order something, I expect to get the exact product shown in the picture and not something similiar. This makes me not want to order through Amazon again."
5,Same reading every time,"I've gone through two scales already; one that turned on by pushing a side button, and another by touching the top first. Both used AA batteries, and both started going through batteries quickly after the first year. This one uses a lithium cell and makes a click when it's turned on by stepping on it with one foot first. It gives the same weight each time and it's accurate--I was weighed in my doctor's office, and the result was the same on this scale."
5,Musical Nectar,"Vibrant and new. A welcome relief from all the pap and canned muzak that bombards us daily.Annoyingly, when I try to submit an ""in addition to"" this World Music Network offering - Cristina Branc's ""Sensus"" (Decca, B00008HCKE) - I get a pesky error message that the ASIN is invalid."
5,Full of useful information,"I have used several differnt travel guide book, and have found the AAA Essential series to be the best. This book is accurate in the best places to see. It also has the things to do to see the local culture, and explains when places are open and closed. It is also lightweight and slim, so it is easy to carry along anywhere."
3,Finally serials are coming on DVD,"While this is a good serial overall, beware that this DVD is only chapters 1-6 and you will have to buy another DVD with chapters 7-12. For some reason, Amazon indicates this for most of the other serials but neglects to mention it for Radar Men from the Moon. My problem is once I realized I had to buy the another DVD, the DVD was out of stock at Amazon and I had to wait a while for it to come in."
5,Wild!!,"This video is just pure fun. My wife had never seen any of thisbefore and couldn't wait to view the next episode. Sure, thestuff is pure camp but it is very fun."
3,Proof we are not alone,"A mysterious set of explosions leaves Commander Cody to the conclusion that we are under attack from an unknown force. As we guessed from the title of the series it must be the ""Radar Men from the Moon"".They've left nothing out and get to read the credits and even get to see the last chapter and find out what actually happened. Unfortunately if you only bought volume one you will not find out what happened on the last chapter. Volume two may not be available.The series and should not be too violent for today's youngsters as most of the time everybody is just slugging each other and when they use guns they can't seem to hit anything other than other guns. If you're young enough this series is very suspenseful. Otherwise you spend most of your time thinking how dumb why didn't they do this or why didn't they do that. Anyway there is a lot of staying in the car scenes or stay in the Rocket ship scenes or don't fly to close scenes."
2,Does not stick well,"This product works if you can get it to stick. It peeled off 10 mins after applying. I used a glue gun, then it stuck."
3,Not great adhesion,"This product was decent for the cheap price, but I would probably recommend you buy a higher quality product. I used this to insulate around my windows this winter and the product kept falling off the window cracks. It does do a good job of insulating the window when it stays in place. You get what you pay for here."
5,Did the trick,"Great for doors, Fits perfectly, and is a lot stickier than I thought. Does what it says and for very cheap. I think this is the most common length for doors (at least indoor ones)."
2,"Wow, really not that great","These earrings had great reviews for the most part, and, in the picture, they look elegant. I know they are inexpensive, but I did not expect them to look cheap. The silver is uneven and rough in places. The bend is haphazard and different between the two earrings (glaringly so) in both bend width and section length. When in my ears, one hung longer than the other, and one had a longer ""tail"" in the back than the other. I tried to re-bend the wide bend and the minute I grabbed the two sections, I felt like the bend would break. I wanted some simple, plain silver earrings I could wear with a cocktail dress, but these are definitely NOT them. I wouldn't wear these with jeans out in the horse pasture. I will return them as soon as possible, and I'm sorry I have to pay the return shipping because these aren't even worth that."
2,Only so-so,This has yet to work correctly. We read and re read the instructions. It is good exercise but it never stops playing the music and does not rate you. The music it comes with is pretty boring so you have to plug something in to make it fun.
5,"Great reel, great price.","Great economy reel for under $12. That's pretty much it in a nutshell. The QuickFireII bail lever works well too once you get accustomed to it, but it's really built for bigger hands."
5,Works great,"For starters, with any aftermarket header, there is the disclaimer of ""Some fabrication may be required.""This header was designed for B series Mazdas with a manual transmission. The only thing I had to take off was an exhaust support bracket that bolted to the bell housing. And, yes, I did have to have a local muffler shop fabricate a pipe to hook it up to the rest of my exhaust, but that is part of having an aftermarket performance part.The coating wasn't a big deal, the header even has a sticker telling you it is not heat resistant and recommends stripping the header and re painting with high heat paint.All in all, it's worth the money."
1,It doesn't fit and Pacesetter doesn't seem to care,"Although the part is obviously of quality construction (excluding the coating), it doesn't fit on to 1986 Mazda B2000 trucks. As the previous review points out the down pipe section dumps the exhaust at the transmission support bracket making it impossible to connect to the rest of the exhaust. If you intend to run your O2 sender you will need a special pipe with a bung welded in, otherwise some bent pipe form home depot will do the trick. The coating is also of poor quality and burned off in the 1st 100 mile of use, oh and did I mention it smoked like a chimney while it was burning off?Now the best part is when I contacted pacesetter about this they asked for images, which I sent them, and then stopped talking to me. Great costumer support guys.DO NOT buy this, or any other pacesetter part for that matter, just have the local exhaust shop make you one."
3,Requires modification,"The header itself appears to be well designed and made, however the extender from the header collector to the exhaust system doesn't fit a stock Mazda B2200 series exhaust. I had to cut off the end that attaches to the stock exhaust 1 3/4"" from the end and use 2"" flexible exhaust tubing to connect it to the collector."
4,"Basic Russian, a grammar and workbook.","Despite its title Basic Russian is probably best suited for the student who already has a basic knowledge of the Russian language. Without any accompanying cassettes, beginning students may well have considerable difficulty with pronunciation. That aside, this book is concise and clearly presented. As the title suggests, it contains both a grammar guide and an accompanying workbook which makes learning the material much easier. Basic Russian also contains a handy vocabulary list of everyday words, as well as several appendices such as a glossary of technical terms and a list of spelling rules. By using up-to-date language (both Russian and English), and a straightforward layout, this is a very good reference work for anyone who is already studying Russian. I recommend it be used along with some audio material."
3,Not a Stand-Alone book,"I was looking for a course book when I bought this - however, it is only a grammar book. You will not receive any introductory instruction on the alphabet, handwriting, or pronounciation. Even vocabulary is hardly explained.It is a grammar workbook in the strict sense. The first page of the book is instruction on gender declensions. It is presumed that you can read the cyrillic.For what is is, it appears to be a good book, though it is clearly not meant to be used alone. Also, from the word ""workbook"" I presumed it would include pages or space to ""work"" in, or to write in answers. This is not the case. There are just questions under tightly-printed sections called ""exercises"".I'm going to keep the book. I believe it will be useful to me as a reference. However in not understooding what it actually was before I bought it, I will need to find a true course textbook to supplement this."
1,Nowhere near worth the price,"This is the most boring exercise book I have ever used. Besides that, there are spelling errors, editing errors, and exercises that are irrelevant to the subject covered. There is no innovation in presenting the material. Nouns in the glossary are not marked with their gender. I live in Ukraine. I bought the Intermediate edition (which doesn't even have a glossary and is even thinner) at the same time. After shipping and customs fees were added to an already over-priced book each volume cost more than $50. I wouldn't pay $15 for it in a book store.My advice: buy something else."
3,Almost Totally Cool,"Over all this is a very good date. The musicians on this recording sound as enthusiastic as on the original recordings. Gerry Mulligan and Wallace Roney are fantastic and John Lewis, as usual, is tastefully sparse and elegant. The only thing in my opinion that takes a star or two away from this date is Lee Konitz not being present. Aside from Miles Davis, Gerry, and John, Lee was the the other major voice on the original recordings. Phil Woods is great, but not for this date. On ""Moon Dreams"", in particular, Lee's plaintive, vibrato-less tone is so missed. It's like having a four legged table with the fourth leg missing."
1,2 defective bubble mowers?,"My daughter received this as a gift from our neighbor. The first one blew about 10 bubbles which never actually even rose from the machine they just kind of blew half out of the machine then popped. Assuming we got a defective one I returned it for the same toy. At this point, I'm sure our neighbor was wondering why they hadn't seen her playing with it yet. Now the 2nd one doesn't blow bubbles either. Coincidence? I think not! Just a disappointing waste of money...."
1,"5 minutes, 5 bubbles","Do not waste your money on this, unless you want to see the look of disappointment on your child's face. It dispensed exactly 5 bubbles in the 5 minutes of playing with it, each of which went out the side and straight to the ground. From the illustrations on the box, it appeared that the bubbles would shoot out the top up into the air. (Of course, they don't show you real bubbles in the picture, which in retrospect might have been a good hint that something was wrong). But in fact, they shoot out the side as grass would shoot out a real mower.On the other hand, it does make a engine-like sound as the little one pushes it. I guess this could be a good lawn mower toy for someone who is not expecting bubbles."
2,Disappointed,"I thought my niece would just love this, she loves bubbles. But the bubbles never once dispensed out of the mower. Next time I am going to get her a bubble blowing gun or something that will actually work. It hasn't been a huge waste of money though, she still loves to push it around."
1,DOESNT WORK,"COULD NOT GET BUBBLES TO COME OUT NOMATTER WHAT WE TRIED. A COUPLE CAME OUT AT FIRST, AND THAT WAS IT. DOESNT WORK AT ALL."
1,Ok to push bubbles are ify,My daughter (2 1/2) can't push this fast enough on her own to make to he bubbles come up. She likes the noises and can push it around the year. We also have a ball-popper mower which she prefers.
3,could've been alot better,my daughter loves to push it around but my husband and i had to run with it so any bubbles would come out. it was a gift but i would never buy it
1,Worst gift my daughter has ever gotten,"This did not blow any bubbles and just leaked bubble mix all over the ground. The instruction manual was no help.My daughter was so excited when she got this for her 2nd birthday as she had watched me mow the yard all last summer. She talked about it all night and when I put it together and tried it out the next morning, it did not work. The only thing that would have been worse is if I let her try it before I did."
3,Better for filemaker 6,"This book did a far better job of explaining FileMaker 6 than FileMaker 7.The book cover states ""Level: Introductory to advanced"", but as far as Version 7 is concerned, it is little more than an introductory primer.In many cases it just ignored the great leaps forward of the program, or, (far too often) just referred the reader to the help files (as reported by another reviewer) rather than giving examples or explaining the concept.Examples are:-1. The let statement enabling users to create variables in a function; users referred to the help files.2. Recursive calculatuions and scripting; simply ignored.3. Pull through relationships.Despite its shortcomings as a version 7 I found the book an admirable reference to Version 6."
3,Go to the Help Files,"This is a good book for a beginner, but if you're an old hand at FileMaker and need a quick tutorial on what's new in version 7 you could do only a bit worse by browsing the help files. In fact, many times in the book the author points to a feature, notes that it looks interesting, and then refers the reader to the help files. Of course, you can do that without buying the book."
2,Ok for beginning but not for using as reference manual ...,"The author takes you by the hand from the beginning of the book to the very end. Sometimes he stops and start discussing about some trivial facts, e.g ""Why it is better to sort a contact list by last name rather than by first name ..."".Well, I didn't really appreciate the book because you can hardly use it as a handbook wich you can refer to in the phase of devlopping an application.The book is good to begin vhen you bearly don't know what is a database and how to operate a soft like File Maker. But for more curious or for more advanced users I'm afraid it's no the book to have."
4,Another subtle Ferrara film,"Ferrara films have certain elements that are so over-the-top that it's easy to see he is often doing (or at least attempting) very subtle things with the camera, script and actors. This plays as the flipside of KING OF NEW YORK, a film that focuses on the mundane details of day-to-day drug dealing (which is not made up of endless shoot-outs on rain-slicked Manhattan streets) and then creates an interesting conflict where cops kidnap the drug-dealing husband for both the right and wrong reasons, and we're sympathetic to the wife (very convincingly played by Drea De Mateo) as she attempts to extricate him due to her genuine love for the fellow, but also disturbed because of their willful ignorance towards the wrongness of what they're doing....it is indeed a ""slow"" film, especially compared to KING (which is a terrific flick), but I think Ferrara is still an interesting director with a unique viewpoint."
1,A Lost Cause,"As you pass by new releases in the DVD department of your video store (and with the paucity of new releases of late) you are feeling a bit desparate, view this little film 'R XMAS only if you are a fan of the SOPRANOS. Both Drew De Mateo and Lillo Brancolo, Jr have been on the popular series and their performances there are fine. Here they are lost in a dreary remake of a remake of a tale of the degenration of people under the infulence of the drug market. The pacing is so slow that it is matched only by the incompetent attempts to mimic Puerto Rican accents from the actors. There is really nothing to recommend this film.....unless it is the only one on the shelf!"
2,could have been..,This movie was about drug selling by people in NY. It could have been entertaining but it wasn't.
2,Disappointing Ink Quality,"I purchased this item because I wanted the finer point than the medium point that normally comes with the Parker Roller-Ball pens. Upon first use it seemed that they (I purchased both blue and black refills) were going to work out fine, but after using them for a few days the ink flow began to be inconsistent and so I went back to the stock refills. I love the roller-ball pens, but I will never buy these refills again."
3,good quality,I like the refill however when compared to other rollerball pens it is average. If I could i'd give it a 3.5... Bleeds out a bit more than the better quality Mont Blanc refills.
1,not too sure about this one :(,I'm sorry to say that this refill was just about dried out when we got it...not a good purchase in my humble opinion. :|
1,wrong picture of the item,"When I bought the item there was a wrong picture of the pen refill displayed. When I received the item, it was not what it was shown I the picture, therefore it did not fit my pen. After I submitted the initial review, the seller changed the picture of the item to the correct picture, and now is asking me to review it again. I still received the wrong item; you are solving the problem the wrong way! I will never use this seller again!"
4,Parker refill,"Great refill, good price. I hope it's going to last longer then the previous one. So far I'm very satisfied with it. It doesn't fit in all Parker pens."
2,Contradictory and Confusing,"The layout is poor with too many sidebars. I kept losing my place on the page when trying all the information. The Q.U.I.C.K system while good in principle is not fully explained leaving gaping holes in the process. At one point the authors tell you that over-the-shower head caddies are one of the ""Three Overated Containers"" and in another section they suggest them for shower organization. Huh?"
4,Clutter book review,"My order was taken and handled properly and with excellent efficiency. Sending notices on when you got my order or when you were sending it, is always a help. I appreciate you fulfilling all of the requirements that come from a book order. The one comment I would like to make may not be anyone's ""fault""...I just noticed it. When I took the book out of the shipping container, the outer sleeves of the book would curl outward. Maybe it was the weather the book endured through the traveling process. There is nothing wrong with the book in any way, so there is nothing about it that causes me to be unhappy. Thank you. I would consider ordering from you again, if the opportunity to do so arose again."
1,cut the clutter don't buy this book,"I bought this book while I was living in America and have just gotten around to reading it.I wish I had not ,the pages are badly set out with to many side bars making it a pain to read .Also there is not enough good information in it to make it worth buying.A note to the editor if you produce this book for the British market you want to use another word than Tosser this is not a nice word over here and may offend some people."
3,It's OK,"THis book did not help in my particular situation. I was testing for a Captains job for another agency, and I think this book is geared for inter-department promotion vs. outside agency hiring. There are some good point, it just didn't work for my situation."
1,Not up to snuff,"This stuff made me break out. The packaging makes it sound wonderful, but the product is greasy and feels awful on my skin."
3,Disappointed,"I had ordered this thinking ir was a derma e product I had already tried and loved. My mistake. It's okay, but doesn't compare to the product I wanted."
2,let me give you 2 opinions ....,"I didn't see any difference in my eyelids, it's a good size bottle, smells nice but still, didn't see any difference, do anything for me. and taking adventaje of the space... OXITOXYN 2 is a REALLY BAD UNDEREYE CREAM. just feel a kind of tighter skin but if you smille, ALL THE RINKLES POP OUT, THAT IS THE WORSSEEE CREAM THAT I EVER USED, PLUS IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE."
1,Not worth the money,"This toy just arrived in the mail and we're already ready to throw it in the trash. It was hard to put together (the pieces just don't seem to fit) and feel apart again within minutes. Even my 5 year old said ""This toy isn't made very well.""We've bought most of the other Diego toys out there but this was the first that we were actually dissappointed with. I would highly recommend passing on this one. It's very poorly made."
5,I laughed til I hurt,"The viewer has to see this to believe it. Its one spinetingling,ride, with a great ending.Where can I find more of these funny videos. These guysare a riot."
1,Do not upgrade or buy,"I have used Money for 7 years and upgraded each year. I have been very satisfied with the quality until this year. This is plainly a disaster. Initially I was put thru an endless stream of tests which mostly assumed that my installation or computer was at fault. When I did a search on the web for Money bugs I found that many others were having the same problems. When I mentioned this, they admitted to 'working on fixes' and then basically threw their hands up. How useful is that? and when will these dozens of fixes be made available. I knew I was in trouble when I bought it the day it was released and by the time it arrived from Amazon, the first time I tried to run it I had to download a large patch. Reverting to 2004 requires each account to be exported individually and is a very time consuming alternative to just reentering all my transactions over again. I strongly suggest you don't buy this product, at least until there are consistently good reviews for at least 1 month."
1,New Users Also Get Robbed.,"A lot of folks here are upgrade users, but as a new user of Money, migrating from Quicken, by the way, I can report equally infuriating experiences with this software. I moved to Money purely for its online capabilities, and guess what--THEY DO NOT WORK. I've experienced most of the problems described in previous posts here...including duplicate entries, an inability to download financial data accurately, etc. etc. etc."
1,Privacy invasion,"Not only do you end up letting Microsoft have access to your credit details etc if you sign up for the 'Free Services', but also you end up getting Advertising links appearing on your computer installing or upgrading it.This is NOT the sort of things one would expect from such a large company, and it is sad that they resort to such low acts.My 'Money Tip', is save your money or better spend it elsewhere and maintain your privacy and keep an advertisment free computer."
2,buggy,"Money is a decent program to keep track of your finances. I've used it for years. And I bought this to upgrade 2001. Unfortunately, I am really disappointed. I just don't see the value in the upgrade.And could Microsoft add insult to injury? Yup, this program is full of bugs. I've had it lock up on me. Throw out of memory exceptions in Visual Studio. And a plethora of little oddities.Take a look if you don't currently have software to manage your money. But, don't waste your money if you have an older version."
2,If only this program knew how to add.,"Thank goodness I realized the mistake on the capital gains form or else I would have been in a lot of trouble with the IRS. It seems if you modify downloaded transactions in a certain way they appear on the transaction register correctly but when you go to calculate capital gains it can't pull up the correct numbers. This mistake is serious to the point of making the whole program useless, and Microsoft has ignored my request for support where I notify them of this situation. And if this makes you want to switch to Quicken Premier it shouldn't, because that program can't always add correctly either. So I guess both of these programs are scandals, but I must say I do prefer the Microsoft interface by far. Just don't touch the downloaded transactions and double check the math by hand."
1,Good fun balancing accounts,"Great job, Microsoft, on another quality product!Trivia question: what do you get when you cross the usability of Lotus Notes with the stability of Mac OS 9 and the security of Internet Explorer? That's right - Microsoft Money 2005!Seriously though, it won't properly download 90 days of transactions from my checking account into a BRAND NEW FILE without garbling stuff. Back to the cesspool from whence it came..."
3,Money 2005 and SP2,"I have used both Microsoft Money and Quicken for years now, to do comparision testing of the two products. One of the new features in Money 2005 is the ability to share the file with other users. This requires that you put your data on the Microsoft Money website. Once that is done you can specify which other NET Pasport users can access and update the data. However this feature DOES NOT currently work with Windows XP Service Pack 2, as confirmed by Microsoft Technical Support. I find that inexcusable since SP2 was out before Money 2005."
1,"Disappointed, I am going back to MS Money 2004","I upgraded/updated to MS Money Deluxe 2005 two weeks ago and should have listened to the previous reviewers. The upgrade deleted categories, created duplicative accounts and generally messed up 10 years of personal financial data. It appears that this software has become complicated to the point that it is counter productive. Given that Quicken 2005 also gets terrible reviews, I recommend just staying with what you have until either Microsoft or Intuit get their act together. I am hoping that I can restore my previous Money 2004 file and get my ""money"" back on this dog."
2,Bugs Galore,"Migrated from Microsoft Money 2004 to Microsoft Money 2005 last week and have been fighting with the program to get it to run properly. Spent an hour with Microsoft support in Bangalore this morning - they were very knowledgeable and tried to be helpful but they couldn't get a net worth report to run without the program crashing. Like most Microsoft programs. before version three, let it be. I'll wait a few weeks until they offer another update patch to see if that works unless they recall the software and refund my money."
4,New Version Works for Me...,"While I sympathize with those who have had trouble, my experience with Money Deluxe 2005 has been great. I like the new web-look interface. The menus and screens are soft, yet detailed and easy to read. I turned OFF the distracting advertisements, I have never used a passport account to use Money products, and I continue to download my bank statements into my Money account from a ""Non-subscribing to Bill-Payer"" bank. The upgrade was seamless - my previous version (Money 2004) was automatically uninstalled at my bidding. My payee categories are unchanged - my auto bill payment ledger is intact. I did have one stock that I sold 'bout 6 months ago showing in the downloaded quotes. Easy fix - removed it from the list of quotes to be tracked.I changed over from Quicken in 2000 and have bought the new version every year. The Money interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate. The price after rebate is more than fair."
1,Serious bugs,"I can't remember the last time I had some much trouble with an application. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. After waiting on hold with India for one hour, tech support could only suggest that I reinstall. If you value your time, stay away from version 2005"
1,Big letdown,"When I found out that with Yodlee I could connect to 2 bank accounts I haven't been able to in the past, I jumped to buying this product. I was very please with Money since my first version in 99 and my files reflect this. Now with many many many hours involved in balancing my accounts almost daily, because everything debit/credit are downloading 2 or 3 times I figure I was better without it. Some days I cannot download statements at all receiving error messages. Lets not forget all the time and long distance charges talking to their tech help. Their update managed to fix a problem with matching similar transactions but that's all. Now I'm obsessed with getting this to run smoothly. You would think Microsoft would be as determined as I am. NOT. Unless you have hours to spend don't get it. It's much easier to manually input all your accounts from the web sites and less time consuming."
1,WATCH OUT--YOUR BANK MIGHT MAKE YOU UPGRADE--egads,"I CANT BELIEVE IT!!! I AM BEING FORCED TO UPGRADE TO A LESS THAN ACCEPTABLE VERSION. WHY??, the only thing they said was now my transactions would automatically download. Is that a perk, I do that already! Quicken is no better, they have major problems with their new version as well, such as no longer supporting QIF files. Great, not a lot of options. Its worth it to keep what you have until you find something that most people can agree is just as good or not better that the previous versions of MS Money such as 2000 or 2001. Happy hunting!!!"
4,looks cuuute!,This watch is really small and the dial is too small. Felt like baby watch but looks ultimately cute...and love the watch!!
1,"pop, rock","I like old disco, for example Modern Talking, Joy (Austria), e.t.c. Also i like melody rock, for example Dire Straits, Chris Rea. My beloved group is a-ha."
4,Desert Giants,"This book, apparently commissioned by and/or published by Arizona Highways, provides a lot of introductory information about the giants of the desert: saguaros. The photos are beautiful and the information enticing. Definitely worth reading if you're looking for basic information on Arizona saguaros."
5,You will LOVE this book.,"This basic book has wonderful information about the Saguaro Cactus that is easy for ANYONE to read. It is not highly scientific....yet delivers lots of information that is readily digestable. The pictures are SUPERB! In fact, it is mostly pictures. I have shared this book with many of our fellow RVers in Arizona and all have enjoyed it."
4,For the questioning teen,"This film consists of three African shorts by three female directors. They've chosen Queen Latifah to introduce each of the films. These are films that will intrigue your teenager and put to question for adults, how can we help our youth make better decisions? This film is an excellet film that can used in schools, community clubs, and church orgranizations to bring about discussion of topics that might seem racy but real! Life-like teen issues for all to sift through for understanding and clarity to see hhow some of their choices might play out. Gritty and real. Loved it. This movie gets 4 stars because some of the cinematography is weak but other than that -- super films."
4,Almost perfect,"Martin Hannett was very very important in thr first post-punk years. He indeed seems to have produced almost everybody of note. On this CD you will find the Buzzcocks, Joy Division, U2, The Happy Mondays, New Order and Nico! One big problem is that there is really quite a bit of overlap with the also excellent North by North West compilation. At least the Buzzcocks, the Slaughter and the Dogs and the John Cooper Clarke numbers are on both samplers. This is probably due to contractual release issues but it does diminish the impact of both these nice collections. A the other reviewer wrote this would have been a great opportunity to have some really rare stuff, plus also some of Magazine's best efforts.This compilation while very good should have been perfect due to the quality of the material he has produced."
4,Big Dictionary,"The dictionary has many words with signs. It is a bit thick, but not heavy, as it is paperback."
3,many words not shown,"although this book offers thousands of illustrated words, I found many of the signs I need for training are not shown. Good book if you have no other choice."
3,A handy book,We are teaching our little one sign language before he can talk well. He seems to like it. It's a second language that is good to know.
4,American Sign Language Dictionary,"This dictionary is extremely useful to the student. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the first word I looked up was among the missing. That word was ""sea"", so I guessed it must be covered by ""ocean."" No ocean either. Since that disappointment, I have found other ordinary words missing, but of course, a dictionary cannot cover everything."
1,Waste of money,"I was required to purchase this book for ASL1. The signs in the book did not match the signs I was taught in class. Both my ASL 1 and 2 teachers told me not to bother with the book. Unless you are going to be an interpreter, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! If you are going to be an interpreter, look for a better book.A much more user friendly book is, ""The American sign language phrase book"" by Lou Fant. ISBN 0809235005"
4,Has plenty of signs,"I like it. Does what it's suppose to do. Would recommend to anyone who needs a dictionary. It is kind of thick, and a bit heavy but full of vocabulary."
3,Good for beginners,"I purchased this book when I began a level 1 ASL course at my University. It was helpful for that course, but quite limiting for use beyond that level."
1,dumb,dont get it it is a copy of a nother book these people are geting sued and they need money so dont buy it you are ripping off anothre company so please dont buy it it really expensive for a sighn book so go get thwe other ones ok because ryou know these people are ripping you off so get a diffrent book this may be recomended but by their company! run dont get thbis book you leave right now so run go quik go go gog go go go go go
4,Good resource,"Good resource book. I've seen books with more vocabulary, but it is still a good resource to have when in a pinch."
1,Don't bother,"The only way you're going to get this product to work as it should is if you have a fairly high level of technical knowledge about computers, but if you have a high level of technical knowledge about computers you should be able to come up with a better way of transferring data (i.e. free). So really, this product is pretty much useless. I don't want to say its completely useless because I might use it to lash things together to make a raft or tie things onto my car, I can't predict the future. Anyways, I'm very disappointed I purchased it."
1,MASSIVE TIME SINK,"There are no real directions that come with this item. Just a step by step process and if there's a mess up, you're out of luck.I called tech and they pretty much blew me off.I tried it through another tech person for something like three hours.I spent almost two days on this and then I got a flash drive and transferred everything over in under an hour.The Belkin cable was returned the next day.Don't buy it. You'll regret it. Get a flash drive or at least some service where tech people don't blow you off."
3,Works fine if you do it right,"The cable does what it is supposed to do, after you find out how to work it. The software does not show where the data is going on the new computer, so you must first find where to uncheck the box for the drive that is not a destination."
1,Yuk!,Bad product-no mention on box it cannot transfer to 64 bit system. After talking to India about this was so informed.Stay away
1,did not work,This was not what I expected...I wanted to transfer data from my boyfriends old computer to his new one. I had to resort to a thumb drive to do so...
2,"If you are buying for PCsync, be ready for a hassle","I bought the item more for the PCsync software and the cable, thus my review is based on PCsync more than the Easy transfer. The copy of PCsync didn't have a registration code with it. Nowhere did it say it was a free trial so I contacted Belkin, they sent me to Laplink, who after some online chats and emails, I finally got a serial # and key. Which only worked to register the software on Vista. More emails got me additional code which was required to be used in 24 hrs. Thus, any future installs will require future emails to Laplink. The application is a bit clunky, but is FAST through the USB. 1.3GB in 45sec compared to 20+minutes through my homes hardwire network. I tested the Easy transfer and it is just as fast."
1,Product did not work.,The Belkin easy transfer cable did not work. The first computer could not find the second computer.
1,Not for Vista to Vista transfer,There was no prior info regarding the inability to use the cable when transferring from Vista to Vista. Naturally' I never would have purchased it if I had kn own.
3,Not to happy with it!!,"I have had so many problems using this and transfering files to my new PC. They keep freezing up, I don't know if its the transfer cords or my pc's so ill try to leave a fair review"
1,Get Away from this DEVICE/ Co.,"This is a total waste of $$. I spent almost 50 bucks for a USB cable transfer-crap that basically does nothing other than pop a prompt with the following message, ""Migration Canceled, Easy transfer will now close"".The funny part is that the prompt obliges you to avoid doing something and shuts down.I installed the CD Driver on my old XP computer (due to the fact that this cable automatically works on your new VISTA computer), connected the cables as mentioned, and NOTHING... Absolutely nothing.Ive been trying for over 3 hours with this crap. Ive used the other WIZARD (on the XP machine) and nothing.Ill update this review, once I get my head clear. PEACE. Fo Sho"
3,NOT SO GOOD,It stops working when I tried to transfer files from Windows XP in Spanish version to Windows Vista Buisiness in English.
4,Belkin Transfer Cable,This worked well to transfer files from XP to Vista--the problem was it was it was a slow process.
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money on this. It does not work. You'll have much more success just copying files via an external hard drive.
1,"Do Not Buy! Bad product, great support though.","After 4 hours, 2 hours with online support. I could not get the files to transfer. It would transfer a few files, then freeze up. The support was great, they stayed with me checking every option. But the product just does not work. Now I have to burn GB's of data onto cd's to transfer it. Such a pain!"
1,IT IS JUNK,The customer service is a joke from belkin...no wonder everyone is sending it back and resells it...it cant find the usb port and says it is corrupted...vista to win 7 ...it is NO GOOD....dont waste your time...
2,terrible software,works good when syncronizing small amount of files at a time but with massive amounts it takes forever and most of the times it stops before sync is completed.
3,didnt work the way i wanted it to,really didnt give me the option for what files to transfer. just automatically transfered everything including settings and defaults. very frustrating. also took a very long time to work. took forever to get running and then forever to actually work.
5,Belkin Review,This was a great product for large file transfers between computers. Software was easy to set up. The most important feature for me was the ability to wirelessly transfer when computers are not close for cable use. I have not used the sync feature yet for all of my computer files just the file transfer feature. This product is much more than just a cable.
1,Lack of serial #,"No where on CD do i find a serial number. When contacted Belkin replied with a no answer email.I attempted to explain again the lack of serial # and my inability to find same.I also asked how, when using CD to install program would i know that a serial number was requiredand how was i to insert same when program asked me for the serial number.NO reply of any kind. Luckily Windows 7 has a built in transfer program which did the datetransfer without the need for the Belkin program."
1,Belkin Easy Transfer Cable,I do not recommend this product. There were no directions on how to use it properly. When I tried to transfer a single file it transfered the entire folder. With Windows XP I used Lap Link which was an excellent product.
4,File transfer for dummies...,"And I am one. Every problem I encountered with the transfer of files from my XP based CPU to the new Vista O.S. was directly related to my failure to follow the very straight forward instructions before I started the process.Once I understood proprietary software and most executables are not accommodated by these cables requiring the user to manually pre-install on the target Vista system, the process was entirely painless. I only rated the product four stars because that requirement can be time consuming or a major encumbrance for those who may have had OEM software or can't find product keys for reinstallation, etc.However, if your are attempting to accomplish basic transfer of data files, music and photos from XP to Vista, I highly recommend these cables."
2,Not so easy,"The first time I tried to transfer data it stalled after more than an hour and and I had to cancel. The on-screen display says if you stop it none of your files will be saved and you'll have to start all over, so that's what I did, although the second time I selected specific folders rather than the all folders and settings. It did work. But then I discovered numerous duplicate files on the new computer--in some cases 3 or 4 copies, from pictures to music to documents, with no rhyme or reason. Far too many to delete manually so I am now having to download a program to delete the duplicates. Very frustrating and time consuming!"
3,Easy Transfer wasn't so Easy,"I purchased this product without knowing that I needed to have Windows XP with Service Pack 2 installed on my old computer in order to move files to my new computer, which has Windows Vista. I have figured out a way to move the files, but the Easy Transfer Cable with USB connections did not work with my system. Don't make the same mistake that I did."
2,cable transfer,This cable works great if you are computer savy and have the patience to get it to work. Transfers stuff well between pc and laptop running windows 7 or vista has trouble with xp reconizing the cable and installing a driver that works. CD provided is useless in theory good idea still needs work to be user freindly.
1,Waste of money,Why does it have an option(reccomended even!)to download all user accounts and settings when obviously it can never do this.Shuts down every time(flashing USB icon with red x)
4,Belkin easy transfer,"This cable was purchased at a good price and works well for XP to Vista machines. Unfortunately the computer that had most of my data and email on it was running winn2K. However, there is software on the accompanying CD that allows you to use the USB ports minus the cable to transfer data. Delivery was quick. I would recommend this seller."
4,Belkin Easy Transfer Cable,"Upon receipt, I immediately tried to transfer files from my old computer to the new one. Once I had overcome my massive computer ineptitude and a complete inability to follow technical instructions, I got it going and despite me, it worked like a charm. It is now part of my permanent computer armory."
3,Vista Only Limitation,"Noting Vista in the Product Name, I assumed it meant it would support Vista as well as other Windows versions. I was wrong. One of the two systems must be running Vista. It can't be used XP to XP, which I need as well as XP to Vista. LapLink is a better solution."
1,Not so great.,"Got this item to transfer my old files and music to my new Vista computer but it stood there until the day after when, I went to check it didn't even transfer one file, I got upset and end up selling it back on Ebay for way less than what I paid for. Not a what expected!"
1,"utterly useless, do not buy.","hello. i am an IT professional. i bought this cable to transfer data from my XP pc to my laptop. It does not work. if you try to transfer more than a few Gig it will hang, it will show you a usb disconnected sign.I gave it a second chance with my new desktop. This time it just sat there assessing what to transfer. 8 hours later nothing had been transferred.this is a completely useless cable.i would recommend copy & paste using an external hard drive. end of story.p.s. amazon is forcing me to rate this item with 1 star. however it deserves zero stars."
3,Belkin easy Transfer Cable,"The cable works fine - the software that comes with it (which is required) does not. It took me five calls to customer support before I could get to level 3, They fixed my problem in 15 minutes. But it took me a week to get to them!Once they set up my system properly, the cable worked perfectly and very quickly."
4,XP SP2 to Vista,"Worked as advertised AFTER I read the fine print which mentioned that the XP machine had to be running Service Pack 2. I was transferring files to a new laptop for my parents and thought this cable would make life easier. I spent HOURS trying to figure out why nothing was working until I realized that they hadn't upgraded their XP machine to SP2. Once I upgraded to SP2, it worked great. Made upgrading to a new laptop much easier than doing it all manually. Just make sure you've upgraded to SP2!"
3,Belkin Easy Tranfer Cable,"works well except for the fact that if the software finds a file extension it doesn't like the program stops, not allowing you to skip and proceed. Possibly, in the future Belkin can come up with a patch to correct this software glitch. This happened several times and I had to constantly monitor the transfer.Mike L."
3,Cable finally worked,"The transfer cable finally worked after several attempts. If there are failures, you need to start over from the beginning. I got a number of error messages without adequate instructions provided on how to proceed. After shutting down my virus protection program and all other active programs, I was then able to transfer all desired files in about 25 minutes. Despite the problems, it was much faster and easier than using disks or CD's. The service and shipping speed from Amazon.com were great."
1,Easy Transfer Cable doesn't work for everyone,"When I attempted to transfer my data from my XP PC to my new Vista PC, the Easy Transfer program locked up when hitting ""Next"" on the first screen. The only way out of this problem was to go to the program manager and cancel the program. After doing research, I discovered that there are other people with the exact same problem. I found a web forum run by someone who is on Microsoft's Easy Transfer. He has been able to help other people who have different problems. However, he hasn't been able to help anyone who has the same problem that I did. I ended up transferring data to an external hard drive and then from the external hard drive to my new PC.This appears to be a great product for some people. But for me it was a complete waste of money."
2,Not Necessary!,"I am a mid-level computer user who used this cable once and found the software confusing. If you have an external hard drive use it to transfer your data. A side note - Transferring from Windows XP to Vista computer is much more difficut than transferring from a Windows XP to Windows XP computer. Vista's file structure is different and Outlook 2007 has its' own problems - still not operating correctly - Outlook 2007 is using half the resources of a new Dell XPS M1710. Hindsight being 20-20; if I could do this over, I'd wait until the computer experts tell us it's safe to jump into the Vista pool."
4,Vista File Transfer Cable,It took four tries to get the file transfer to work. I suspect the problem is with the (inferior) Vista operating system. It did eventually work as intended. The product itself is fine.
1,Belkin Junk,"Does not work as directed.Buy a couple of flash drives and download your files to them.Much easier,cheaper and you have something usefull when you're done."
1,It does not work,This product was supposed to make it very easy to transfer files to a new Vista computer from one running XP. It failed totally--it started gathering information and then froze. Several attempts with the same result. Resorted to a FLASH drive and moved on. Total waste of money.
5,Belkin Easy Transfer Cable for Windows Vista,"Extremely easy to use. Comes with its own CD. One needs to remember that two monitors are needed to accomplish file transfer, one for the old XP computer, the other for the new Vista computer. Transfer requires that each computer has a USB port available. Programs cannot be transferred using the software supplied. There is a beta version of a program transfer system available from Microsoft but I have not dared to try it yet."
5,Works great,I bought this cable to transfer files from my old xp computer to my new desktop with Vista. I used the windows easy transfer software rather than the software that comes with it and it worked great. I had all of my files and pictures from the old computer transferred in less than an hour.
5,Worked Flawlessly,"It worked perfectly for me. I went from a HP Windows XP Pro to a Dell Windows Vista PC. I loaded the software onto my HP, connected the cables, and after a few prompts, just left it alone for a few hours. I came back and it was finished. All my pictures, music, and documents were on my new machine. I decided not to transfer over all my settings, because I liked the feel of my new machine."
1,Belkin Easy Transfer cable for Windows VISTA,I found the Belkin easy file transfer cable for WindowsVista to be very difficult to use. It was easier and quicker for me to copy files from one computer to another by using an external hard drive to transfer the files. I would not recommend buying this product.
1,Save your money,"After spending several hours of trying to get this program to try & get past a point where nothing happens, I decided to just transfer my files to a flash drive & install them onto my VISTA laptop, it was much easier, the Belkin Easy Transfer was a waste of time & money."
4,Great product,"Great, easy to use works every time no hassles just plug and start transfering files. have used it several time with different computers."
1,Not Easy At All,"Like many others here, I found this product basically unusable. After hours of effort and multiple attempts at starting the trasfer process I finally gave up. It seemingly works for some people, but I found it a total waste of my time and money."
2,Not Needed If You Have a Networked Computer,"The Belkin Easy Transfer Cable for Windows is not needed if your new computer is connected to a network that has your old computer on it. I tried for several hours to get this to work. It constantly disconnected itself. This caused me to start over. Finally, I realized all I had to know was manually transfer the files through the network.The cable does not transfer programs, only data files. The program mentioned in the documentation indicated that Microsoft has a program that will transfer programs. The only problem is that Microsoft withdrew the program.An alternative to using the cable if you don't have a network is to burn the files from an old computer onto a CD or DVD then copy them to the new computer."
1,Belkin easy transfer cable for windows vista what a waste of time,I bought this cable to use the new transfer software in Windows vista. It does not work so I ended up trannsfering all my files by DVD this works much faster and easier and I would not of had to spend all the money to by the cable.
1,"Error, error, erro",I couldn't get this product to work. All i got was an error message stating that there was an error in scanning my data and easy transfer would now close. No other info at all. I googled the error message and found many others with the same problem. Save your money and get a professional to transfer your data.
2,Belkin Easy Transfer Cable,I was really disappointed when I couldn't install the Easy Transfer Companion to help me transfer files from my old PC (XP Proffessional)to the new one (Vista)The message was that I should use US English which was what I had on my new PC so till now I've not been able to do the transfer making the cable I bought USELESS.
3,cumple con su funcion pero no estan maravilloso como se ve,"cumple con la funcion de transmitir la info de pc a otro sin necesidad gastar dinero y tiempo en quemar cd, dvd, etc. pero no es tan maravilloso como uno piensa, la velocidad de transferencia es relativamente lenta, y muchas veces en medio proceso se cae la tranferencia y hay que hacer el proceso varias veces."
2,Belkin Easy Trasfer Cable for Windows Vista,"While I am not a computer geek, I think of myself as being able to handle a lot on my own. I purchased a new HP copmuter with Microsoft Vista abd wanted to download my information from the old XP computer. I purchased the Belkin Easy Transfer cable and can only say that it is not easy. After about 3 hours of frustration, I gave up and took my computer to Best Buy to have it done. Again, it would be me, but as you can see I am not happy with this purchase."
1,Useless cable,"Useless thing. I bought it in Staples for $45 and very unhappy. Works (if works!!!) very slowly, stops after every 10-15 files, you have to repeat transfer again and again.After this garbage I use only USB flash devise."
1,Worthless,"Four attempts at a data transfer, all failed. Every time I let it run several hours but it hung on a file."
4,Good for the price,I bought this product to transfer files from my windows xp pc to my new windows vista. It transfered all the programs and settings with ease. It was a lot cheaper than the cable that HP was selling on their site.
2,Not impressed,Not sure what was the problem. But it took at least five trys to get the process done. Then the files were not that easy to get back...itunes did not convert to itunes on the new pc. Might be a microsoft issue otherwise I would have only give it one star.
2,Old PC Must be XP,"When I read the spec's for this product, I thought I read that it would transfer Windows 2000 files, but not the favorites and e-mail. That was ok for me,so I ordered. The software does not install on a Windows 2000 machine. So be sure you only use it with an XP machine!"
3,Transfer cable,"Only reason I rated this a 3 is that I could not use it. You need your old computer intact, including monitor to transfer files to new computer, with monitor. I had only one monitor and therefore could not use the cable for transfer."
1,Did not work for me...,"Followed all the steps, and what was supposed to be easy did not turn out that way. I kept getting error messages on the Vista PC. I opted for a wireless transfer through my network. I sent the ""easy transfer cable"" back."
3,Not that great.,"For the basics, this transfer cable would be fine. However, the directions are not that great and do not include instructions on how to make sure that all items are shareable."
2,Meh. Save your money,"It is indeed a diamond steel, but the diamond is so rough that it actually makes my knives duller. The main purpose of a sharpening steel is to re-align the blade. Leave the sharpening to the pros.Pros:It will slightly sharpen the trash knives you have kicking around in a drawerCons:Ruins the edge of good knives.With time the diamond might wear down to a useable degree, but for this much money I want something that works out of the box, not something that might take months to be able to be used as it should"
4,Great steel for Katana series knives,"Reading some previous reviews and the one that mentioned this steel is made out of VG-1 steel and therefor if harder than the actual knife being sharpened. Well, I bought this steel because I bought the Katana series knives, and I know they are also made out of the VG-1 steel. The diamond grit seems to be quite effective at honing the blades on these Katana knives along with sharpening (maybe it's only sharpening) I'm not a knife expert, but have had the Katanas for several years now and I find the steel quite effective on those knives.If thinking of using this steel on other sets of knives, maybe find another steel other than this one. If you own Katana knives though I could recommend this steel."
3,My product did not arrive.,The item did not come to me so I got my money back. I am satisfied with that.
1,A Poor DVD,"This is a collection of hastily written songs that are nonsensical at best and downright annoying most of the time. My 20-month old daughter will sit and watch this because of the video, which changes frames every second or so, and they do flash numbers up frequently. But there are certainly no educational benefits to this video, and the lyrics are enough to drive an adult insane. Baby Genius does much better when they stick to classical music or nursery rhymes, rather than attempting to compose their own songs. Save your money for something more worthwhile for your child."
5,Classic tv,"I love the twilight zone, some of the best tv ever done, genius, and I like the way the collections organize episodes according to theme"
1,Five-star collection at a one-star price!,"This review is only about the exorbitant price being charged for these sets (I guess I somehow hope that one of the greedy studio execs will see this!) This show is great, no doubt. One of my all-time favorites, in fact. But 35 episodes for anywhere from $75 to $100 depending on where you buy?!?! I bought 35 HOUR-LONG episodes of the equally excellent Outer Limits for about the same price. The 35 episodes that make up the first season of the Andy Griffith show are going for half that at 30 bucks!! Again, another equally excellent classic. So, I think I'll buy the Andy Griffith show, pass on this latest TV studio rip-off, and catch the TZ marathon on Sci-Fi again!"
2,Why TZ Will Not Be Released By Season,"Well, at least in my opinion it won't be, which is a shame. The reason why involves the potential lack of profit in doing so.The reason is not chronological order; with a show like the Twilight Zone, this means nothing. We're not talking about a series that has any type of continuity. Each episode was its own, with no cross references.The problem is that the quality of the show went down in its fourth season, and took an even sharper dip during its fifth and final season. Don't get me wrong, there were some gems to be found; ""Living Doll"", ""Death Ship"", ""Steel"", ""The Masks"", and ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" are some that come to mind. But I think most fans of the series will agree with me in that the gold mine lay in the first three seasons.So don't hold your breath for a season release. The company that did so would likely lose money on the final two sets."
1,savings?,"I have just purchased my fifth and final set, with over $400.00 invested now, and then I see this product at Wal-Mart at an everyday low price of $48.23. I thoght Amazon was more competitive than that. Major, major RIP-OFF!!!"
2,Via$$$,Please do not buy this collection. Instead protest and demand that it is rereleased correctly. At the local Best BuyI have seen several people pick it up and pass it up. Each of these individuals have bought several sets of other Television programs. Why-1) Hefty price- fair market value is about $3O for a season.2) Not Chronilogical- some volumes even go as far as to force the inferior hours on you.3) I have used the naviagation menu for one episode and it is bad plus weird.If Via$$$ ever decides to reissue the TZ correctly then Donny will buy. But until then I have the done correctly Season one of Outer Limits.
2,"wonderful show, terrible DVD production","I've been a big fan of TZ since it was rerun when I was a little kid and I was ecstatic when I heard they were releasing the entire series on DVD. I bought the first two box sets and was quite dismayed by the quality of the release. The shows are well mastered, but there is very very little extras added in, the menus are very poorly designed, and (most annoying, esp. for a ""complete"" set of releases) the episodes aren't even in any sensible order (why not chronological? Ugh!) This is the first series of DVD's I've decided not to collect all of and I'll be selling mine used. :^("
4,Chicken Soup for the chri stian woman's soul.,"This is a spirit led book that brings Gods grace, hope and his love for us back to the believer when we follow his direction or plan for our lives. This book reminded me of the power in a faith filled life. This was a page turner. Inspirational."
4,Enjoyable stories,"I enjoyed reading through all of the wonderful stories. This is a book for all denominations. There were even a few stories that were for Catholics, etc. Many of the stories touched my heart and made me think. As I was reading it, I kept telling my husband, ""I have to read this one to you!"" Overall, I enjoyed the book."
1,appualing,Many of the stories in this book are distasteful. I would not recomend this book to anyone.
2,Outdated nook and overpriced,"I purchased this book thinking it had a wealth of information in it -- The book refers to old litho prinitng techniques, film and such...The general content is 10 years or more out of date..It is not worth more than $9.95 at the best. I paid best part of $50 for it....So much of the information is far to liberal and generalised.I would not recommend this book to ANYONE unless the price was under $10. It is certainly not worth $50 or more.A very, very overpriced and overrated book.On the back of the book I recieved it had a reduced sale tag at $8.95This book needs to be entirely updated with modern technologies and information.I have purchased and hired books with so much more modern information than this has.It needs to be completely re-written. Not a good buy AT ALL !! !"
3,collection ?,what can I say its a godzilla cartoon series. it didnt go far for a series well what did they expect they took the monster that was gonna eat someone and made it thier friend. but this helps me complete my godzilla collection.
1,I thought the book grossly oversimplified the real issues,The book focused on the triviality of the personalities behind the case and really shed no new light on the substantive issues
4,"Lovely, romantic, and touching","Though the twin stories took a while to clarify themselves in this reader's mind, once they did, the novel was quietly hypnotic as it wove together themes of loss, love, and historic tragedy. Set in a seaside English town today and in the early 50s, the book is suffused by a sense of isolation and longing, of human insignificance in the face of the limitless waters that can erase whole cities over time. The prose was beautiful and I read many passages over to savor the author's vision."
2,Slow and Dull,"This novel starts out very slow and uninteresting and only barely picks up. It paints vivid pictures of the coastal town and even of the characters in a physical way. But the main part of the story, the relationships, falls flat and remains ambiguous. With the interesting lives led by all the characters, in both timelines, so much more could have been developed. The actions of Lily, Max, and Elsa all seem random and without any motivation. It did offer interesting information about Germany and it's peoples lives before and during WWII."
4,Good floor puzzle,"Although my 3 year old and I prefer Wooden puzzles in a frame, we had fun with this floor puzzle. I get frustrated with the blank white pieces on outside of puzzle, but she fits them in like a whiz."
3,"Somewhat worthy, but very dated","I look at this album as one of those albums that 'could have been.' It's most unfortunate quality is the fact that Steve doesn't sing, with the exception of 'Woman of 1,000 Years,' easily the best tune on the album, followed swiftly by his instrumental. Guitar followers may love to copy the licks, but all his wizardry can't disguise the fact that ""Atomic Playboys"" is a third-rate Whitesnake knock off, and it doesn't get much worse than Whitesnake, so draw your own conclusions."
4,"Fun, but not our favorite","My son does love this toy, and it did withstand a dunk in a glass of milk and the washing machine, but it's not our favorite. Not the toys fault though, he's just picky."
5,Great Toy,Purchased this toy for my (then) 3 month old. He really loves this fancy rattle and still plays with it 4 months later.
3,My least favorite Manhattan Toy,"We have several Manhattan Toy Company toys and I have to say this is my son's least favorite. We love the Whozit, the Winkle and the Zulu, but he rarely plays with this one. He'll shake it a couple of times and then throw it to the side. I am slightly disappointed since the others were such big hits at our house."
3,"Not bad, but not the winkel","I bought the winkle, also made by manhattan toy, for my son. He absolutely loves it! I thought this looked good. Well, he likes it, but not like the winkel. But my biggest complaint about it is that it can only be surface cleaned. I much prefer the toys that are plastic and can go in my dishwasher or kitchen sink, or the fabric ones that can go straight in to the washing machine. I know it is trivial, but if your child drops stuff as much as mine does, hand washing is an unneeded hassle."
2,Not real henna,"I have not used this product and do not intend to. The product info mentions that it is 100% henna, which it is not. It contains indigo and represents as black henna. There is no such thing as black henna. I am not sure what would indigo do to my hair."
2,Can't Recomment Hella Supertones,"I've installed Hella Supertones (made in Germany)on 2 previous cars and loved the results. The ones I just had installed are made in India and both the sound quality and loudness are greatly inferior to earlier Hellas. I'm unable to install them myself, so I had a very reputable VW shop install them on my 2010 GTI. Took 2.5 hrs labor at $75/hr. Wish I'd never bought the darn things. The Hella spin is that they're 7 times as loud as most stock horns. They might be almost twice as loud, but the frequency is lower and not attention getting. Save your money- these do nothing to add to safety."
5,GREAT BOOK FOR YOUNG AND OLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a great book and I have all he has writen, He was a great writer and my whole family has enjoyed all his book and we even give them as gifts.But I think this was his best book of all, all the short stoeies about the different game is great. Its an easy read and kids too will enjoy reading it or have it read to them. Just WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,the beginning of the most famous love triangle in Western history,"This is a fascinating epic, meticulously translated and annotated by Cline. It seems to be amazing how much you can learn about some of the most cherished tropes in Arthurian legend by reading this, but this is ultimately unsurprising as The Knight of the Cart was the original source of the Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot love triangle. It is packed with magical imagery, dark humour, and, of course, fatal flaws. I wish I could read Old French so that I could have a better familiarity with the original text!"
1,NOT-SO-WONDERFUL LAND OF OZ,"Based on the Oz book of the same name, the movie gives the phrase ""turkey"" new meaning. Its special effects stink, its costumes for the birds, its acting so-so (at best), its songs pathetic. You get the feeling someone wanted to cut as much costs as possible with no regards to the quality of the movie. The same holds true for the Jack and the Beanstalk movie - poor acting, poor special effects - and the numerous movies it previews.There is a silver line behind this dark cloud of a movie, though. In 1981 a stage production of The Wonderful Land of Oz was televised, entitled The Marvelous Land of Oz, and eventually released on VHS tape. This was as good as The Wonderful Land of Oz movie is bad and worth a look-see.Getting back to The Wonderful Land of Oz, maybe someone will drop a house on it or something!"
2,"Too Little, Too Late",Would have been nice to know that the test was changing and this material was utterly useless in the interim. Failure is always an option with this set of books.
2,Book Too Big,"This book is gigantic. It's full of ""in between"" information and is not suitable for an IT grad or someone with experience. The A+ is not a professional exam, its an entry level exam. I recommend the fast pass or something written by Mike Meyers."
3,Does not glow in the dark!,"Disappointed that the costume did not glow in the dark as advertised. The glow in the dark feature is the reason we purchased this costume vs purchasing one in the store. We even held it up to a light to see if that would make the costume glow in the dark.The rest of the costume was of good quality, comfortable and fit true to size. The face mask also fit better and had good eye openings.If you don't mind that the costume doesn't glow in the dark then you will like this costume."
4,"Great costume, runs big","This seemed to be the only type of glow-in-the-dark skeleton costume out there, so I'm glad I got this one at a reasonable price instead of the $50 one! I received it very quickly (before the estimated arrival date) from Costume Hub. My size 7 child fits into the size SMALL costume just right, but the gloves are adult-sized -- no kids will ever fit those! It doesn't glow very much when you first take it out of the bag, but if you shine an ultraviolet light on it for a while, it will glow better. Overall, it's a great glowing skeleton!"
4,Nice costume but gloves too big,"I bought this skeleton costume, Small size, for my nephew.He is coming to 5 yrs old. The length of the costume is just nice.However i find the gloves are too big for a kid's hands.If only the gloves are according to the kid's size it would be almost perfect."
1,Istanbul,"I was terribly disappointed in this book. It was self-indulgent--depressed, depressing and dark. I would certainly never visit this place based on the book. To be frank, I couldn't even finish it."
2,Tiresome and boring,"I tried to force myself to read this book, after all the man was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, but after 60-70 pages I just couldn't do it anymore. The book makes me think that the man has needed phychological help his entire life. The book was very negative and to use the word he uses over and over and over, melancholy. One of the reviews stated that he must use that word 100 times and it is true. It is even in the heading of three chapters. I have been to Istanbul and I have a very different impression of the city. Maybe he spent too much time looking at black and white pictures in his darkened room. I hope his other books are better because I wonder why he was awarded the Nobel Prize."
4,Huzun Redux.,"I returned from my 6th visit to Istanbul a couple of days ago. I took along Pamuk's book thinking it might be fun to read about the city during my stay... This is not really a fun book to read, though it is a good one. As one reviewer pointed out the translation is very well done. The style is smooth and flowing. If you can't visit Istanbul in the grips of winter, Pamuk's book will give you some idea of what it is to walk alone through this great cities back streets and alleyways and to feel history rising up to meet you at every turn. There really is a special melancholia to Istanbul in the winter and Pamuk captures it perfectly."
2,Re-titling,"I'd re-title this book ""Memoirs of a Boring Childhood."" Like many other readers I *want* to enjoy it. Turkey is a fascinating country and the author received a Nobel prize!I tried to read this book twice, and just (rare for me) couldn't make it. At some point you have to make your own judgement of a book, Nobel or not. And this one is boring."
1,yawn,"Frankly, this was a painful read. Not because of the subject matter, but because of the writing style. I gave up reading it several times, and convinced myself to pick it up again (only because i do not like to leave books mid-way), only to give up reading it again."
