2,Suprisingly dissapointed...,"I've purchased this CD based on huge popularity of previous albums on radio,good reviews on Amazon, plus this album always comes up as one of the bestsellers in Chill/Jazz/Electronica genre sections, of which I'm a big fan. Well, I was highly dissapointed after listening for 10-15 minutes, and could barely go through the end. They are not bad, it's good music, but nothing special. The sound and beats are too familiar from 90% of other Chill bands. I did not sense any originality,direction, and movement in any piece. Every piece flows and finishes the same way it starts. Wallpaper,wallpaper, wallpaper. The bottom line is that I've heard this million times before. Even vocals don't help this album. I wouldn't spin this album even if I owned a lounge."
4,"Again, TC builds on their own sound","How do they do it? I don't know. But they do their research and its apparent in their methods of mixing and production quality of tracks. One of these days I will make it to the 18th st lounge in DC that they own and I WILL enjoy it immensely, just like I do their cd's. Notable tracks?Indralebanese blondeso com vocesamba tranquillethe mirror conspiracyilluminationthe others are good, but I highly enjoy the ones listed above the most. They just stand out and make you hit the 'repeat' button and enjoy it more and more. but when you buy it, hit 'repeat' on the whole album first, it's well worth it."
4,good make-out music,"If i was going to make-out with somebody, this is what i'd put on the hi-fi. Solid beats with a latin flavor, and a well concieved album all around. Stand out tracks are Lebanese Blonde, with that infectious sitar hook, and the dreamy Focus on Sight. These guys are almost too hip for their own good, but I can overlook that, as it's been increasingly difficult to find new albums I actually enjoy, and Mirror Conspiracy is good listening for sure."
1,Another CD to throw away,"Nu jazz, downtempo, chill out, whatever you want to call it these guys are the most well known artists of the genre. They also happen to be some of the worst. This cd especially is an incoherent mish-mash of unemotional and flat samples, something which takes no skill or musical ability to accomplish. If you want something in the same style but with something called ""talent"", check out zero 7, jazzanova, or nuspirit helsinki. If you want something that will blow your mind, check out any one of the 8 Future Sound Of Jazz compilations."
2,Maybe I Missed Something...,"Disappointing. The sounds here are saccrinated (new word here), disposable and processed and the arrangements, predictable. First Thievery Corporation purchase will be the last. This act is popular so they are evidently for some people, but not for me."
2,Lawrence Welk for the 21st century,"If you really want to hear world music, get the real thing, not this elevator-music version."
5,i like this cd,the song with bebel gilberto is the best song on the disc. that song alone makes this cd worth 5 stars.
3,Probably as good as this stuff gets...,"Good drinking companion; minds its own business, stays out of the way, avoids sharp corners and lends a generally upscale air to things. Not something I'd listen to constantly as it's basically elevator music for hip people, but it's very well done. The compilation they recently did for Verve is better, though."
3,for your martini hour (if you ever have it in your schedule),"The Mirror Conspiracy is a good album but not an extraordinary one. That is relaxed and loungy, even mellow sounding music with ""I don't care about anything"" kind of attitude. It is background music. I do not see it as a ""must buy"" but I am not sorry it is in my music collection either. The track I listen to the most is ""Air Batucada"" - this is a real pearl! The fast beat and breezy sound of it make the album come to life. Otherwise, here is your three stars solid buy."
5,High on these grooves,"I didn't like this CD as much as the band's first, but now I like it even better. This is an amazing mix of styles, all knit together in such a way that it becomes a seamless whole -- true global music for the 21st century. Rob and Eric do an impressive job of creating music that is so evocative. Each song is like a soundtrack to a film that only exists in their heads. As another reviewer said, they rely more on guest performers here and less on samples, to great effect. All of the women singers, Babel Gilberto, Lou Lou, and Pam Bricker, do an awesome job. The title track and Lebanese Blonde, both sung by well-known DC-area jazz vocalist Pam Bricker, are destined to be hits. I can't get them out of my head! Truly a great record."
5,Excellent Excellent Album,This is currently my favorite T Corp studio album. What an excellent collection of tunes.
4,If Jarre were a hipster,I have always been a fan of electronica starting way back with Jean Michel Jarre and Eddie Jobson. Thievery Corp take this genre up a notch with their amazing rhythms and digital sampling. I find this music perfect for continuous play.
4,Nice album for relaxing or doing work.,I listen to this when working on homework or just chilling by myself. Has a hip urban sound to it. Reminds me of a high end bar filled with professionals. Get it if you like electronic lounge thats relaxing and sounds hip.
3,Aural pablum,"This recording is perhaps best described as Easy Listening Lite. A little bit of this, a little bit of this - all pasturized, homogenized, pre-masticated, synthesized and blended into an unidentifiable aural pablum. Buy in complete confidence, there is absolutely nothing with enough edge to offend anyone; in fact, you could leave the room in the middle of track one and come back fifteen minutes later and be forgiven for thinking that the same song was still playing.Novacain for the brain. What's to complain about?"
5,Thievery Corporation a Conspiracy or the Real Deal? ... the Real Deal,"This was the first Thievery album I purchased. I have had the album for five years, and it never gets old. When I first listened to the album I immediately was hooked on Thievery's smooth, worldly beats. Thievery does a great job of combining lounge music with a worldly feel, and I think this album best exemplifies that combination. In the case of the ""Mirror Conspiracy"", you will find French lyrics mixed with hypnotic melodies, while there is also a Middle Eastern flavor to some of the songs such as ""Indra"" and ""Lebanese Blonde.""I recommend this album to anyone who wants a smooth lounge experience, or anyone in general that just wants to listen to quality music."
5,just another 2 disc 77 tracker,"so you like rephlex? This album is a little bit of everything that rephlex stands for. Playfulness, hardcore gabber, indie punk electro songs, ambient songs, songs of no more than one sound and drum kit. Why buy this album? Well first, each song is short, no getting bored with a track. 2nd, if you like bogdan raczynski or mu ziq or aphex, this guy lies on the border of all of them, you'll like him. His songs are very well made, each song has a melody and some bass and some drums, the essential ingredients. IF they are ingredients, then it could be said that he is an imaginitive chef. your brain is the stomach. After listening to the 2+ hours of music you will either puke or go back for seconds. i did both"
4,"Sometimes funny, sometimes frightening, always warped","This new work from Ovuca raises the weirdness bar to a new level. Basically, we're given more of that electronic music that you can't even begin to dance to, but the slant is even weirder than usual. Drugs? Maybe. A strong creative force? Obviously. Whatever the muse, this is two cd's full of usually short ditties that can make the listener laugh out loud or feel extremely nervous, possibly even fearing his or her life. The odd samples, computer game type music, techno bleeps and blips, jazzy sequences, and tweaked noises are all there, but they are presented in a way that more than likely would confuse most people. However, fans of some of the more ""out there"" electronica (the IDM crowd) or maybe the Residents would probably find this album well worth the money."
2,Beware - This is not about the Traveller game,"Okay, I thought this book would be about Traveller, the game. However, as the picture of the book shows, it is about being a world traveler (one 'l'). I don't know how the codes got mixed up. But they are. The traveling book, as it were, is dated as well, so is basically not useful. No fault of the sellers. Just a legitimate name mix up."
5,Beautiful coffee table book on The Swamp,"Make no mistake, this isn't a history book on the Florida Gators. What it is, though, is a great ""coffee table"" book on the game day atmosphere in The Swamp where the Florida Gators play (and opponents fear to tread!).The star of the book (as it should be for coffee table books!) are the photographs. The photographer, Glenn Danforth, is world class and it shows in the photos - they're stunningly beautiful and make the book a worthy one to have in your collection.Not only that, the photos are often taken from unique perspectives and areas that the every day fan doesn't have access to, giving even more insight into what goes on.I love the book and so does my Dad, whom I bought a copy for. Every Gator ought to own a copy."
2,Too soft and squishy,"Might be ok to practice with, but in real play you do not want to rely on these paint balls to break or fly straight. On a hot day, you can see them start to form dimples."
1,What?,"`Ok two of you said they were extremely hard.... and one of you said they were too soft and squishy.... Mine are extremly squishy.. I havent used em yet... cuz I have Thousands of other paintballs to go through, but I opened it up to see what the quality of the cheap paintballs was... and it felt like a marshmellow... but a marshmellow with lots of goo inside....."
3,Hard as hell,These balls rarely bust. It's like being shot with marbles. Breaks equipment it hits such as goggle lenses. Good for making stray dogs and cats scream.
2,its ok for a 4 pack,"Well,this dvd was ok...tghey could of used better camras for the night scenes this dvd did have the punch of the 360 videos or any othere street racing movie..i think i could of made one better this dvd seems like they did it with a computer but did know wat they where doing...So i gave it 2 stars for lack of punch i prefer 360 VIDEOS LIKE TIMELAPSE HARD DRIVE AND OTHER VIDEOS LIKE ON THE SCEEN 1,2 AND STREET FURY SO DONT BUY THIS VIDEO IF U WAN TTO GO AHEAD BUT THE DISC SCRACTHED EASY OLNY HAD IT FOR A DAY AND THE DISC DIDNT WORK!!"
1,Poorly researched populist pulp,"Thomas Asbridge makes some fundamental mistakes in an effort to blame-shift the cause of the crusades onto the Papacy.One such fundamental mistake is to state that (aside from Iberia) Islam and Christendom had been fairly at peace for more than a century.In effect he wants to suggest that out of the blue the Popes decided to attack Islamic controlled territory. He simply misses out on the many ongoing conflicts such as in Sicily, raids upon southern France, and attacks on the (Eastern) Roman Empire including the major battle of Manzikert (1071). The omission of this battle alone from any consideration is startling.This alone should be enough to make people wary of buying a book that was written to make revisionist history popular. Many of the glowing accounts about this book are by people who no doubt rely solely upon this work for information from this period."
3,Pretty dry writing....,"Starts too many sentences with ""Indeed,..."" Who talks like that? Indeed, I can't think of a time in my life when I started a sentence with ""Indeed"". And I only mention it because it got to the point where it was actually distracting, like ""What does he mean, ""indeed""? Does he mean ""In fact""?"" Is this a British thing?Also, as many times as he uses the terms ""Levant"" and ""Provencal"" I finally had to look them up in the dictionary. And it took me a while to figure out that by ""host"" he means ""army"" or at least maybe ""brigade"" or ""Division"" maybe? Indeed, I still don't know what he means by ""host"". Maybe it's a British term?"
2,Ho-hum another crusade book,"Here the auther had an oppurtunity to write a book from the perspective of each player, but instead took the course of every other crusade author and give an account purely from the Christian crusader perspective. Also at times, it seams as if the auther was cheering on the Crusaders and spent a lot of time justifying some of the atrocities commited."
4,Unfamiliar people in unfamiliar places,"This is a scholarly yet accessible history of the first crusade, appropriate for nonprofessionals. In stretches it reads almost like a novel. Asbridge discusses the various motivations of the crusade, ranging from genuine religiosity down to the desires of younger sons to carve out their own fiefdoms. The history centers on the leaders -- the ""generals"" of the crusading army, the Byzantine Emperor, the Pope and his delegates -- giving relatively little information on the lot of the ordinary crusader. The key figures, however, come through more as titles, dates and events than as vividly depicted human beings; this may be a inevitable limitation of a book intended as history and not as an historical novel. Military tactics and weapons, too, are given only superficial treatment. By contrast, the politics, alliances and strategy are covered in some depth."
2,History?,"I have only read some of this book and I've already run across multiple statements where the Author says something is face and he does not back up this information with any research or any sited information. While the narration pulls me in, I wonder if this book should fall under the category of history even though it is in theory based on actual events. It is very frustrating to read an author who proclaims something to be true but then refuses to follow it up with any source or concrete evidence."
2,Lackluster songwriting from a brilliant songwriter,"This CD is the weakest of the 11 Al Stewart albums I have on CD. Most of the songs are melodically uninteresting, and not up to his usual level of lyrics. Of the many historical topics covered in his songs, Stewart is normally at his best writing about the years around the First World War. Fields of France is a genuine disappointment, both lyrically and melodically. Perhaps it's the insipid, synthesizer-heavy arrangements, but Stewart's band, which includes the very talented guitarist Tim Renwick, a mainstay on earlier Stewart releases, sounds uninspired. Peter White's spanish guitar solos are an ill-fitted attempt to replicate what he has done so well on other Stewart albums. On a positive note, the album finishes with its best material, Antartica, an instrumental called Ghostly Horses of the Plain, and the album's only truly good song, Helen and Cassandra. This CD is for those (like myself) who would like to own Stewart's enire discography."
2,Not impressed with this book,"I was really disappointed after reading the great reviews. The quality of printing is not too great, and the content is nothing special - too trite."
1,I don't recommend it,"While Bovenes has a very soothing voice, the content of the tape just isn't very good. I've used a number of tapes by various authors for sleep, relaxation, etc. This one is one of the least helpful."
2,A matter of taste.,"I realize that Lang Lang playing brings young people to his concerts. I am all for that. I like his theatrical approach to the Beethoven Sonatas,Albeniz, Iberia Book 1,Prokofiev Piano sonata No7 and his Chopin. He has the technique, but no passion in his playing. A good showman with an excellent Technique, but nothing else. Over the years he may obtain this. One has to compare him to the young Helene Grimaud playing the Ravel piano Concerto in G, conducted by Vladimir Jurowski. The 2nd Movement is breathtaking and extremely moving as played by Helene. Lang Lang could not match her,for he has no substance."
2,Not worth the price.,The 300 years of Kitchen Collectibles is sorely lacking in information about the last 75 years of kitchen collectibles. The majority of the book covers what I would call primitive kitchen items. The photos are grainy and lack detail. If you have a kitchen item that you need to identify..this book might prove useful.
3,"Remix, not bad","I picked this up after hearing one of the songs on a celt radio show. Not bad, but not what I'd call the next U2."
1,Be careful with this cage!,My senegal parrot got its toe caught in the cage were it joins together. Tore its nail and bleed for several hours before I got it to stop. If you use this cage you need to look it over to make sure there are no places for your bird to get caught-up
3,Good but not great,"The package was deliver promptly. However the instruction sheet was quit lacking, just a printed picture in a exploded parts view. I managed to piece it together. Would have preferred some written instruction on how the parts were secured together. I do realize that you get what you paid for, but if I had seen this same cage in person before buying I would not have spent the $100 I paid for it. It is my opinion that the cage is constructed very cheaply. I wish there would have been a wheel lock on the wheels because every time we ope the cage or cover it freely rolls across our hard wood floors. I recommend you try and find the product in the store first so you can clearly see what you are paying for. Other than what I have mentioned this cage will meet my needs for the time."
2,Late Arrival,The books arrived in good shape but took for ever. Standard shipping method uses donkeys.
3,little tight,"I wear a size 4.5 shoe which is very hard to find locally. I have found that Amazon has a good selection of smaller sized shoes. I have two other pairs of David Tates shoes, both of which fit great. This pair of Sport Loafers is a little tight in the toe area but great in the length. My local shoe repair shop should be able to stretch them a bit."
1,Way too narrow,I live my other David Tate shoes but these medium are too narrow. Tried stretching them but the leather and price is great.
5,Confotable,"As advertised, great fit and very confortable! You can wear them all day.Give them a try, you will love them."
2,"Not Neruda in accented English, please","As a Spanish speaker and admirer of (any) literature, I do believe that the most important aspect of any poetry is -- more than rhyme and structure -- its rhytm; unless, of course, someone's genius translates the same impact into another language. I cannot recall being fully satisfied when I read poetry outside its language; be it Pablo Neruda or Emily Dickinson. Here we have some of the most fabulous poetry of the XXth century translated into English and sung with a Brazilian accent....hmmm.I admire Ms Souza's incredible musicianship. She is not just a singer, he is a true artist/musician trying to explore and expand, as has been succesfully proven in her Duos CDs. But her phrasing is rooted in Portuguese and these bland melodies do not lift Neruda's poetry out of his original milieu. So: two stars for the effort, but I cannot hear this disc again."
1,I have heard!,"The review directly below mine is NOT a serious one: he literally hasn't heard Souza's new CD, and says so! He writes: ""I had to choose a rating for this CD, which wasn't my choice. I haven't heard it yet, either, but suspect it will deserve at least 4 stars, based on Souza's previous work.""Based on previous work??? Is he kidding???I am amazed that anyone would have the gall to ""review"" a CD based on ""previous work""! Give me a break, please.Oh, I have heard this ""exotic"" CD and Souza's a terrible singer. If you like Billie, Ella, Sarah or Carmen, don't buy it. Although marketed as a jazz singer by her publicist, Souza cannot be compared with such great divas."
1,poor quality for the money!,"light weight, cheap construction, the slide loader broke easily with in the first week of use!"
3,Not of Hall & Oates Fame,"This isn't a solo album by Daryl Hall, one-half of the Hall & Oates blue-eyed soul duo. Whoever this Darryl is (note the double 'r'), he is obviously very talented. But amazon.com shouldn't have packaged this CD with Daryl Hall's."
4,Great practice for writing!,"I couldn't give this book five stars because it lacks CDs to accompany it, but it is GREAT for practicing your writing and learning some additional vocabulary and/or reviewing some of the words you learn on the way. I recommend this as a supplement for writing practice, NOT as something you get to begin learning MSA (Modern Standard Arabic). I will keep coming back to this book throughout my first year to practice my writing with the exercises it provides. Good book for starting but BEWARE it has no CD and some sounds in Arabic NEED to be hear in order to learn!Overall I highly recommend this book for beginners to practice their writing and pick up/review some vocabulary words. No real grammar included, the writer stated that this book was not designed to be a thorough introduction to MSA but guide to writing and reading Arabic."
5,Helps you read & write any language that uses Arabic script!,"I am using Rosetta Stone to learn Persian (Farsi) because it's become necessary for my work. While Rosetta Stone is fantastic for learning to speak, it doesn't provide any help at all with understanding the mechanics of the written language, including recognizing 'letters' and writing the in new language. I looked around and happily discovered this book, which gives a detailed guide to reading and writing Arabic script.The wonderful thing is, this book helps with ANY language that uses Arabic script for writing, not just Arabic itself. The book teaches the script much like learning to write cursive in grade school---first the individual letter, then how to connect two letters together.This book will not teach you how to speak the language, only how to recognize and write the letters of Arabic writing. It makes a great supplement to help you in learning one of the Near-Eastern languages."
5,Step by step guide to writing,"This book is exactly what it says - a workbook for learning to write in arabic script. You learn letters and then connet them into words. It has plenty of practice for each letter and uses the letter in useful vocabulary words. Don't rely on it for grammer, thematic vocabulary, etc. but I thought it was great for the alphabet."
4,Shamanic Revivalists?,"I found this gem ""Hancaoma"" by Stille Volk, a while back, and it is a really strange and haunting experience. It sounds like some Medieval German/Swiss woodsmen have camped out in an old log cabin, with a whole bunch of instruments, like Hurdy-Gurdy's and Lutes, found some red and white mushrooms, and have had a great old time. I like this because it blows away the cobwebs and stuffiness of some Medieval (as in serious/classical) groups, and have given us a different perspective. It is totally unique and rather odd. If I could find any fault with this at all, I would say that the overall sound quality is not that great, perhaps it was recorded on older digital equipment, it's got that old digital compressed type of sound to my ears. (oh well)"
3,"Luis Miguel ""Amandote a La Italiana""","Yes, an early CD by the GREAT Luis Miguel. I wish ""El Sol"", as he is known to fans, would re record the entire song list with his mature grown up voice. Oh, and by the way, Luis Miguel is half Italian. I own this CD but prefer his later sounds."
1,Teenage LM in Italian with no lyrics!,"Old LM from his early career. We are talking about teenage lollipop immature voice. The material is just run of the mill boring commercialized adolescent rock converted to Italian. This stunt adds no value to the songs. LM's italian is rather bland and uninspiring. On top of that, the cd includes no lyrics!!Skip this one. A waste of money."
1,BeeBop--No Heartstrings,Ptoooey! This is an insult to the classical language of romance and love. Even his native language would recoil in disgust. Give it a miss unless you want some shallow workout beats. Sigh.
2,Ectaco review,poor visual and audio display. I found Rosetta Stone to be more helpful for learning Arabic
2,bit disappointing,"The opening screen gives a bit of a clue that none of BS' music will be played on this dvd, which points to the fact that this is certainly not authorised. Didn't tell me anything I didn't already know and glossed over some important stuff. Worth a watch but doubt I will ever watch it again."
5,Awesome,"This is really a great book. I read the book ""Forever"" and the reference of that book in this book is why I got it. Great Seller, Good Condition & fast service."
4,Great for vinaigrette lovers (not so much for creamy dressing lovers),"This little book is cute and easy to use. It has a few creamy recipes in the beginning, but most of the book is devoted to vinaigrettes. I was personally hoping for more creamy recipes, but this will still be a useful tool. I look forward to trying the Avocado Dressing, the Italian Buttermilk Dressing and the Creamy Curry Dressing.I would wholeheartedly recommend this for people who love vinegar-based dressings."
3,"Good, basic recipes.","This is a good recipe book for people who are new to making their own salad dressings. With that said, I've been making my own salad dressings for a while. So if you're looking to just start out making your own dressings, this would be a good book to start with, but if you're looking for more advanced or more interesting recipes I would check out other sources. However, for being more experienced I did find a few interesting recipes I hadn't thought of before."
4,Was Nice - but a little smaller than I was expecting,This was a nice little book - and it is really little. I ordered it with some other items and almost did not see it in the box (it was under the invoice). It would be nice if it were a little bigger or had a litttle more content - but it does what it says - it give you 50 salad dressing recipes.
4,Nice,Book is kind of small but its still easy to read.. its in black in white no color photos but lots of nice recipes.. not just for salads but for other foods too..
1,The Grand Tour (A Load of rubbish),This book is a complete load of rubbish. Tim Moore simply runs at the mouth and his mostly contrived antics quickly bored me to tears. I'm at a loss as to how he managed to fill all these pages...his one talent seemed to be the ability to natter on and on until his editor begged him to stop.
1,Rubbish,I was going to sell my copy until I discovered that used copies were listed for 42 cents. That tells you all you need to know about this worthless book!
5,My Bichon's favorite toy!,"I just got a puppy and went a little overboard with toys and supplies. This is Mollie's favorite by far. It is the right size for a smaller dog. Also, it is easy for her to play fetch with. She loves it! Highly recommended. A good value for the money."
3,Good first Album,"It was a good first album, He has a lot of potential, some really good roots. I expected more from other reviews that I saw. It's worth buying. The backing is good you'll recognise two or thee of the back up beats. Just remember he was good enough to be in the ""Harmony House"" Album produced by Berres Hammond.God Bless,Rasta Kid"
3,Good effort,This is Chrisintis debut album and its a good effort.Some songs are forced like sentimental reasons and place in the sun but there is some good roots reggae on here and although hes no Sizzla or Luciano he has a promising future.
1,Extremely Fragile,"I realize that this thermometer is made of glass and should be treated with care, however, this product is downright fragile. I wanted to secure the thermometer on the inside wall of the tank that faces away from my windows. As I pushed the suction cup against the glass the bottom of the thermometer touched the aquarium window and shattered. It was not a large impact in anyway because the only sound I heard was the clinking of the ball bearings as they fell to the bottom of my tank. I decided to avoid the problem in the future and purchased this digital thermometer as a replacement:Digital Aquarium Terrarium Thermometer ST-3 Black."
2,Disappointment,"This book did not turn out to be as good as it sounded. The style of photography offered was more along the lines of magazine documentary pieces, rather than many genre's of simply beautiful photography. We wound up returning it and purchasing some other books that suited our purposes much better."
5,Well worth it,"Great sharing of experience and informative. I read half the book in a day or 2. I couldn't put it down. It isn't a specialty book, it covers many aspects of the national geographic photographer. Worth the money and much cheaper then retail in Barnes and Noble!"
3,Too much emphasis on photoshop. Light on photographic technique and equipment.,"This book is OK. I was expecting a lot more emphasis on the artistic aspects of digital photography and more information on technique. I was also expecting a lot more information on equipment. More than half of the book is devoted to editing and managing photos using photoshop.Of course, I probably could have figured that out by looking at the table of contents. In that case I probably would not have purchased the book."
4,Good trainer kite,"You need decent wind to launch this kite, but it provides a nice training experience for windsurfing. Overall good product, but sometimes difficult to launch in lighter wind conditions."
5,Wonderful collection of songs,"I bought this CD for one song, ""Remember Me"", and fell in love with pretty much the entire album! My 5 year old really likes it, too. Definitely one to get if you love great Christian music that encompasses several different genres."
2,A dismal choice,"I really had high hopes for this album. My previous Dove album, pre-2000, was a joy to listen. I spent 7 days listening to this album 2-3 hours a day, before I wrote this.This is how I would grade the selection: A+ #13; A- #12; B #'s 3,5; B- #'s 1,2,10; C #'s 4,11,14; C- #'s 9,6; D #7,Bonus track; D- #6.I do not know what the criteria are for choosing songs. But most of this album is musically lacking. This album is a poor representation of prior Dove albums. This album has shown me the artists that I do not want to purchase and own."
4,"POD's ""Alive"" was nominated for ""Song of the Year"" too","""Not that this is a bad album... but it would have been a whole lot better if AT LEAST P.O.D. ""Alive""(The song that obviously needs to win ""Song of the Year"") was included. Most of the other ""Song of the Year"" nominees are on the disc. It's too bad. The owner of the CD is missing out on some good music. Anyway, pick up ""Dove Hits 2002"", it's got some great songs on it, but pick up P.O.D. ""Satellite"" too. Even if you're not a rock fan, P.O.D.'s CD has a lot more to offer too."""
3,Outstanding Selection,"I din't need the harmony. Melody was sufficient. Flute fingerings should be included for beginners. Without those, they had to be entered manually which was tedious and time consuming."
4,Stand is fine,"I hope that you don't expect too much out of this. It's excellent for the price, the mic and cable are freebies and you get what you pay for. the mic would be great to give to your kids or to let your friens who always wants to swing the mic by its cable while singing karaoke but definitely not something your going to replace your beta 58 with. Stands don't get any less expensive than this one, especially with a boom so get this one to hold you over until you can afford that one handed heavy duty stand that you said you would never spend that much on."
3,Still in use after several years,"Okay, so it's not the pro quality stuff that they use onstage, but it's been plenty good enough for my personal use. My only complaint would be that it's rather lightweight and I had to weight the bottom of the stand to provide the balance I needed. A small detail that was easily overcome. I give it a thumbs up for modestly priced equipment."
1,Displeased with the product,"The service was great and I got the product in excellent time. However, neither my husband nor I could get the map wheel to work on a US map which is what why we purchased it."
5,Amazing book!!,"This is an absolutely stunning collection of photos, renderings, sketches, etc of the famous mid-century case study houses. It's size and heft was shocking at first, but the large pages are filled with crisp and clear high quality photos. If you or someone you know is a fan of mid-century modern design or the case study homes in particular, then you can't go wrong here. Amazing quality and a great value!!"
5,Great study and book.,This is a classic of the mid century housing. It has the full plans for these iconic houses. A great joy to own and to read.
4,Beautiful edition,"I bought this as a gift for my photographer husband who loves architecture. The photos are gorgeous and there is lots to absorb. He loves it. It is a smaller edition, so the type is really, really small."
5,Great for Classroom or private tutoring EFL/ESL,"I have used this book as a white American to teach Taiwanese and Korean people the use of these very common idioms in English. All the idioms are set in their context well, with easy to follow, yet challenging exercises. The cassette tape companion is useful but not necessary.I have used this book for 3 semesters in a major language university in Seoul, Korea for teaching Conversational English and it seems to be a good tool for them.Again, all the idioms presented within are pretty useful and not too hard to learn."
1,have not recieved this item,"this was never delievered to me , repeated emails with no response seriously considering never doing business with you again"
3,it would work,I have used this product before and i thought it was.fine for.color. i do bodybuilding contests and this wasnt dark enough so i had to go with something else.
3,Carol Singer,This item has not arrived yet. Not sure I know how to go back and reserach the order. Please assist
5,Great Wedding Present!,"I made this for my friend when she got married. She loved it! She hung it proudly in her kitchen.I'm a beginner at cross-stitch, and this product was just perfect!"
5,stamped cross stitch,love it. niece loves the pattern and can't wait for her to finish the is. this is making say more
5,Excellent,"For someone who has not down a lot of cross stitching before this project was a little moredifficult and time consuming than expected. However, I did enjoy doing it."
4,If you really like Violent Femmes...,"then this CD won't disappoint. However, some of my other family members heard me play it, and asked how I could possibly stand it. I just like the crudeness of the lead singer's honesty about life experiences."
5,love it,i bought this bc i couldnt find around anymore.. my old one is completely scratched up. i love it
1,the one I got didn't have the song I like,"I ordered one used that appeared as if the song I like, ""Scream if You Want to go Faster,"" was on it but it wasn't. the songs were in a different order and sounded less produced. I am not a happy camper."
4,"Good, stable program...with one flaw...","Ulead DVD Workshop 2 is a great program, does exactly what it's supposed to do. You can customize your DVD to your heart's desire.Our only complaint is that the menus are NOT WIDESCREEN. And it looks like Ulead is NOT going to upgrade this program. What a shame...otherwise it's a super program for creating DVDs."
4,Lovely sound and beautiful instrument,"I bought this flute from Ralph Sweet a couple years ago and have been playing it ever since. It has a rich mellow sound that is beautiful alone and fits well in a session. Although it can be played as a beginning flute, it will take you through many years of learning and playing. If there is a downside, it's that the low Irish D is a long flute with wide finger spacing and some people don't like this (the flute is a total of 24 inches long with 1 inch spacing between holes). I have no trouble with this flute but it may be an adjustment for people used to a smaller instrument. It's worth the time to learn to adjust and the instrument is lovely to behold, the longer I have it, the deeper the wood shines and the more compliments I get! For the price, it's one of the best flutes available."
3,2 ringers-Plus his final hits,"This sloppily compiled CD starts off with 2 original versions of JB's classics-""I Got You"" and ""Please Please Please"". But why they're included on a collection of Brown's later hit years, is anybody's guess. Brown's final chart records were all in the 80's and early 90's (outside of ""Living In America"" he had no Pop crossovers) and here he only gets lucky 3 times , ""Living In America"" (this is the remixed LP version, which ran 6 minutes, not the 45 version which is a little over 4 minutes), 1988's ""Static"" and 1991's ""Move On"". The others fall flat, including a duet with Aretha Franklin. The rest of the songs are split between Producers Dan Hartman and the R&B group Full Force. Brown fares better with the latter, but neither one can light much of a spark. This is mainly for die-hards. All others should seek out JB's classic years."
5,excellent guide book for touring Buffalo's Americanesque masterpiece,"This well-written and nicely printed paperbound book is the perfect accompaniment to visitors and tourists as they proceed through the building, taking in the beautiful design of this architectural gem in the heart of downtown Buffalo. You don't need a tour guide if you have this book with you!"
2,Small book with interesting content...but...,"this is a tiny brochure, with black and white pictures. It is not a book and certainly not worth more than 10 dollars! Way too expensive! I wish someone would publish a proper book, with color pictures, on this amazing and beautiful building."
5,FUN!,Great message not only for kids but for adults as well. Animation made the reindeer almost real. I have been passing this around to others.
4,Blizzard,"Blizzard is a great movie for family viewing. It's good for learning to take responsibility for what you do and facing the consequences. Plus, it's a good story. We all enjoyed it very much."
3,Cute Holiday Movie,This is a cute holiday movie. I think families with younger children (ages 4-14)will enjoy it most. Worth adding to your favorite holiday collection.
2,ok,"i have another mothers meditation book, this one was ok, but kind of simple. Would have been better if i had gotten right at child's birth."
2,badly needs an update,"Many of the open questions have since been answered or redefined with the MAP and Planck satellite missions. Unless you plan to supplement your reading of this book, look elsewhere first."
5,Michael Angelo Womens Dress Watch,"Hi -I don't know how much it is worth, but I received one as a gift a few years ago and loved it. I just recently lost mine and would be willing to pay 200.00 for yours."
3,"Sex, greed & scandle.....","Chandler Texas and the family that runs it, it's a soap opera where everyone is after thier own selves, fortunes and place in society. Chandler Hospital is where it all begins, the estate of Jacob McQuade is at stake as his new wife attempts to steal everything from the granddaughters including their inheritance. Mrs. McQuade sells off the Rocking M and when the old man dies, there is a debacle about the Rocking M Ranch. There are medical questions to ask oneself while reading this book, it moves very well and there are mystries invloved.The author does a great job in her writing skills and the story flows. If your a soap opera fan, this is a must read for you. If your into mystries there are things in this book for you to read. Good book."
2,Not so new or different,"I didn't really find anything new or different in this book. I ordered it because the other two reviews on Amazon.com gave it such high recommendations, but I wasn't especially impressed with it. A lot of the book was taken up with stories/examples of people's successes which didn't read that differently than the free ones you can read about on numerous on-line sites. I would have appreciated more specifics and less repetition. I didn't find this book especially inspiring."
3,Note from a Pet Sitter,"If your pet sitter isn't asking about your pets needs and behaviors before agreeing to care for your pet, you're in trouble. As a pet sitter, having a client hand me their Dog Sitter's Handbook would be useless. Not only do I not have the time to read it, but I would already have asked all of these questions of the owner directly. The only use I can see to this book is if you are hiring a ""free"" pet sitter such as a neighbor or friend. Even so, it would be a lot easier for them if you wrote everything concisely on a single sheet of paper. And don't forget emergency phone numbers and directions to your vets office."
4,A helpful and thoughtful book to leave for your Dog Sitter,"My only complaint with this little book (and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that it is too small for the purpose. The information provided is excellent and would help a Dog Sitter tremendously, especially the fill-in-the-blank pages that really personalize this book. This great book deserves to be much larger in format instead of a super small 'gifty' size...but it's still no reason not to purchase this book and use it over and over again! I have dog-sat in the past and wished I had a little something to go on. This is just the ticket! I do recommend it highly...just don't expect a full size 'handbook' as the title indicates."
2,Cheaply constructed,"This sword stand serves it's basic purpose, but could have been better made. If you buy one, take a few minutes and drill out pilot holes for the wood screws, otherwise the cheap wood will crack and split."
1,Missing parts,I received the stand and it is missing the neck of the stand. Rather difficult to use without that integral piece.
3,Wait until they are a little older (and heavier),"I bought this for my son 2 1/2, and he is neither tall enough, nor does he have the weight required to turn it. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone under 5 years of age, or 45 lbs. The car itself weighs about 40 lbs, so you need some strength to both move it and turn it. I'm sure he will love it in a year or two, but not yet."
4,Great Car,"We just purchased this car for my daughter's 3rd birthday. She was able to hop right on and pedal with no problem - she's even small for her age. She initially had a lot of difficulty turning/steering the car (which some other reviewers have mentioned), but this problem was quickly fixed by oiling the steering mechanism underneath - then she was able to pedal and steer fine! I would highly recommend this if you want a pedal-type car."
1,"Hard to Assemble, Cheap Plastic Crap","The assembly directions are poor, and the assembly is difficult because of the cheap design. (I'm a handyman with a garage full of tools, so it's not like I'm a stranger to putting things together.)Tough for a 4-year-old to steer, but even when fully turned, the car has a ridiculously large turning radius.Wheels are so slick, the car cannot climb a slightly inclined sidewalk (the child's weight is over the non-drive wheels)."
3,BIRD FEEDER,"THE BIRDS ARE USING IT BUT THEY ALSO USE THE OTHER FEEDER IN THE CAGE, THINK WE INTRODUCED IT TOO LATE IN THE GAME FOR THEM TO USE.IT OK. birds did not like it at all"
1,Woefully Inadequate Packing,"The refrigerator seemed OK, but it was packaged so poorly that it arrived with paint peeling off, the door hinge badly bent, the compressor made a loud knocking sound, the door had a new hole in its tops (from the hinge being shifted). The door would not close, the freezer coils were loosely hanging from being dislodged. There were major dents on 4 of its six faces. I can not believe these guys are in business with such poorly packaged products. I would be surprised if most of them did not arrive damaged. The packaging is one piece of carboard around the refrigerator with two pieces of sytroam at the bottom."
4,Sturdy and Full-Featured Camera,"This is a great camera. The batteries seem to last forever compared to my rechargable Nikon 4300. The controls and settings are very intuitive, and the results are fantastic. I'd recommend this camera to anyone looking for a sturdy, reliable digital camera."
2,Very Disappointed,This camera has a SIGNIFICANT DELAY between pushing the button and snapping the pic. It's extrememly hard to capture any kind of movement; forget taking kid pics; and the delay also can cause the shooter to move the camera before the shutter moves.
3,Pictures don't look good on the Computer Screen,"I did a lot of research before actually settling on this A 95 from Cannon. The pictures look great on the LCD screen and if you hook them up on the TV, but when you download them on the PC and look at them, they kind of look dull. It was so disappointing to see the same pictures that were so vibrant and colorful on the LCD screen and on TV, look dark and lifeless.I played with the camera by increasing the resolution and the compressoin of the picture, but to no affect. I took with many different lighting (indoor and outdoor) but I still couldn't get the pictures to have some life when I downloaded them on the PC.I finally returned the camera. I am back to my Nikon SLR and Film rolls until I get a good Digital. I am now thinking of trying for the Nikon Digital SLR. The only thing is those are not easy to carry.."
1,Camera burnt internally after 3 months,This camera was good for 3 months. I had taken it to LA last week and took a few snaps at the beach. I did NOT drop it in the water or anywhere else. After some time I started hearing clicking noises and after that there was a louder noise along with a burning smell.Maybe the other review about moisture affecting the camera is true. It would be pathetic if you can't take pictures on the beach or near the pool etc.
4,Significant Mistake,"Canon does not pack rechargable batteries and charger whichis really bad because1. The alkaline batteries that come with the package die in notime.2. The rechargable batteries and charger come for 32$ from sony[NiMH batteries]. Canon's are far costlier in comparison.Also, I find the camera somewhat slow in operation. I mean ittakes time to record images into the sandisk cf card. The camerais not as easy-to-use and sleek as I had thought it would be. Ihave asony dscp72 camera which came in cheaper and was more handy.The zoom in and out using the semi-rotating switch is not ashandy as the two buttons for zoom in and out were in sony camera.Also, the camera buttons (up and down) etc are not easy to getused to. Sony scored far better at this.The camera has not given me any problems as such but it was notquite up to my expectations of easy to use and sleekness.I am still exploring it's many functions which the sony cameralacks and so can't comment on them."
1,BEWARE - NO WARRANTY,"Camera used to take pictures in coastal area of Brazil. NEVER exposed or immersed in liquid. However, Canon will not warrant due to Moisture Damage. ACTUALLY told by Cust Support that taking a camera from outside to an inside air conditioned environment can cause condensation and VOIDS the warranty. Would have expected better quality and more than a couple days use for my $300 investment. Turns out this camera is disposable. If you purchase, avoid humid environments such as Florida, all of the South, etc. This camera was taken great care of and stops working just because I take pictures on a humid day."
5,I love It!,"I purchased this camera- my first digital- not knowing what to expect. I am impressed by the fact that the screen can be turned to face you or to the one being photographed, and it can be turned in towards the camera itself, keeping it from being scratched. The features are awesome, and the photo quality- printed photos on plain everyday paper, and they were just incredible. My daughter's Sony doesn't even come close to this one! This is an amazing camera! I recommend it to anyone looking - a first time user, or someone replacing one."
5,Great Camera - Lots of fun,"This camera is almost perfect!!!Lots of features are built right into the camera. In addition, you can buy lens and filters or even an underwater case. This camera can eventually do just about anything you can think of.The 5 megapixels are great for 8 x 10 prints or even 13x19!!!!Would like a battery gauge that gave more warning of dead batteries and longer battery life."
2,hope this one don't break!,"Well, just got my A95 in the mail. I was VERY reluctant to buy it, since I bought the Powershot A70 only a year and a half ago and already it is broken. The only reason I went for the A95, after feeling burned by the A70 (same at A95, except with 3.2 MP and no flip LCD) was because I had already spent lots of money on Compact Flash cards and this was one of the few that still uses CF.Frankly, I'm really pissed off at Canon for making a camera that didn't even last 2 years under normal usage. Now all my shots have these horizontal lines across it that ruin every photo. The guy at the camera shop says it must be some problem with the chip and I can send it back to Canon for $160+!! I had heard such good things about these cameras, but I guess durability is not one of them. I'm hoping I was just unlucky with the A70 and my A95 lasts longer."
1,Avoid Canon Cameras - E18 Errors,"I've had three Canon digital Elph cameras in four years. Each has failed with a E18 error, likely because of the fragile telescoping lens. Canon did replace the first one as it was less than a year old. But the 2nd and 3rd each failed shortly after the year-long warranty ran out. I'll never buy another Canon product."
1,Software NIGHTMARE,"The camera promises a lot of solid features, but I wouldn't know first hand. I haven't been able to save any photos to my computer.I have a Dell Inspiron 8600 with Windows XP. I have experience installing software and hardware. This camera has completely thrown me off. I've had driver conflicts and can't get the computer software to work with the camera. Usually it does not find the camera or it reports the camera ""in use"" when it does.And good luck if you do have trouble. Tech support at Canon doesn't exist. Dell has helped me repair bigger problems (driver conflicts) and I've had to restore system settings at least three times.Bottom line...it ain't working. I have a $350 paperweight."
3,Camera Sensor Died,"I bought this camera in 2004 and it has had light usage. Its features and functions are good, but around 2010 the camera stopped working. There was a known issue with the CCD sensor that Canon acknowledged was faulty. I was able to return the camera to Canon and get it repaired for free."
2,Good until...E18,Here's one more A95 to add to the ever increasing list of E18 failures.Thanks to the horror stories from the other posters I'm not even going to waste my time trying to get this repaired. The camera is only about 2 years old... guess I'll put it back in the box and wait to see the outcome from the class action suits!The camera really performed nicely when it was working... thus the 2 stars. Hope you have better luck than me if you get one.
2,Very disappointed -- got the dreaded E18 error ....,"I bought this camera from amazon in May 2005. It was GREAT until I got the E18 error on Halloween. (That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.) Then I started googling and found it seems to be some sort of design problem with these cameras. That wouldn't bother me much if Canon was willing to work with people but I was quoted the same roughly $100 repair price as an earlier reviewer with the short 3 mo. warranty on the repair. If I trusted that the camera would actually stay fixed, I'd do it because otherwise I really like the camera. But I don't trust it and I'm not impressed with Canon's customer service. I previously had problems with a Kodak digital camera and Kodak was good about repairing it free of charge even when the warranty had expired.So I'm staying away from Canons now."
3,I'm not getting it,"After reading the literally hundreds of positive reviews for Canon cameras generally, and this one in particular, I bought one after our older Kodak DC3400 finally died.When the pictures are good, they are very good with this camera. It seems though that I can take more bad pictures in one weekend than I did through 5000 pictures with the old Kodak - blurry images, and in dim light or dusk settings, lots of red eye.Love the fact that it uses AA batteries though, makes it easy to replace if the batteries die and we can't recharge them."
4,"Nice camera, but too heavy to take around..","An excellent camera for almost everything you want it for, but the weight of the camera, will make some customers return it. I had to return it because I want a pocket size camera to take anywhere."
2,Stone Dead after 5 years!,"I bought this Canon A95 in February of 2005. A week ago it blew a chip out and now no longer works, period. To have it repaired will cost way too much and I am very disappointed that it only lasted this long. I also have a Canon A10 which doesn't work either. I will NEVER buy another Canon Camera product again. What a waste. Oh, and I paid $278 for it new which I don't consider to be a cheap camera. BTW, I have a 35mm Olympus 28-110 that has lasted well over 10 years and I take very good care of my cameras and equipment. Obviously, Canon isn't building a good product."
3,"Pretty good camera, but...","I've owned Canon film cameras for a long, long time, and loved them. And the A95 is a good entry-level digital. But even though I read all the Amazon (and other) reviews before purchasing, including the many red-eye warnings, I must say that the problem is bad enough that in spite of only having used it for a few months, I'm already looking forward to my next camera."
5,Extremely versatile camera. Fairly easy to learn.,"I bought the camera for myself with the intent of showing my parents how much more useful it is than the old style film devleoping camera. Nut shell: old dogs sometimes would rather you peddle your tricks somewhere else. I do think it would have taken a large amount of work to teach them even if they were willing. My parents don't exactly keep up with technology. My mother is still only playing solitare on the computer I bought her last year.Though there are a large number of configuration options, I was able to learn quickly how to take night time pictures with exposure adjustments. The pivotal screen makes the camera twice as useful. Much easier to take difficult photos like using a tripod (for a tall person like myself)This camera will likely be a bargain in another 9 months when the price drops to $250."
2,Not great if you want to capture a moment,"I received this camera as a gift in December of 2004. My sister had 1 step down and really loved it. She takes a lot of scenery pitures and the images were very sharp. It was fine for taking vacation photos. The pictures were very bright and clear.The problem is I now have a 9 month old little boy and I have very few good pictures of him. It takes so long to actually take the picture after you push the button you miss whatever it was you were trying to capture. I took 14 pictures of my son and his eyes were closed in every one of them. he focuses on the little orange light and closes his eyes right at the moment I take the photo. I called Canon's help line and they had me try several different settings - but still not great photos.My inlaws have a Kodak (that costs way less than the Canon) and it takes great picures. I hesitate to buy a new one because this camera was so expensive, but I would like to have some good pictures of my son."
2,St. Matthew's Passion,"In this book, the print is very small and leaves no room for writing in it (which I needed for class). The tenor, alto, and soprano parts ARE NOT written in treble clef, which is what I was most upset about. I would NOT recommend buying this version."
5,Great,Great score for those who miss the German version. Still have trouble listening to the English versions and this makes it easy.
4,Very nice!,"Awesome assembly experience...they provide all tools needed, great packaging. Once assembled, works great, very smooth. The console should support more than one user, but does not. I had a treadmill and moved to elliptical due to less stress on the knees. So, far, after a month, I love it!"
5,Sublime Sci-Fi at its Best!,"My first encounter with science fiction was 44 years ago, when my father gave me a tattered novel to read. I'd not long graduated from the Beano and Dandy comics, and I initially found the tiny print and hundreds of pages of that Penguin edition of Last and First Men rather daunting. It proved, however, to be not only a rewarding task, but truly nothing short of a spiritual experience. There are many other reviews available, so I won't bore you with yet another synopsis. I am simply eager to tell you that this book is almost a one-off - almost, but not quite, if you count Mr. Stapledon's other related great work, Star Maker. Whilst these two novels are best described as sci-fi, they are, in my experience, unique in the history of the genre. Their depth and beauty causes them stand gracefully aloof as special works of art."
4,Good but not for everyone,"This is definately not a conventional book, sci-fi or otherwise. For brevity, I'll just talk about the First and Last Men, though much of the same could be said of Star Maker. If you're looking for easy-reading, fast-flowing modern entertainment, don't read this book. It's slow at times, has almost no individual characters and is in many ways unrealistic. On the other hand, it has better than average prose, is broader in scale than almost any other book (being a history of eighteen successive species spanning billions of years), and can be very enjoyable if you can get into it. I'm a sci-fi fan and was looking for some more unusual books when I came across this. I enjoyed it very much but I don't think the average reader would. If you're constantly judging the material, or anticipating goal-oriented plot/suspense points as you might in a more modern novel, you'll probably find it unreadable."
5,I found this stimulating and sweeping,"It seems like a few of the reviews are very negative, but I would say that it is unfair. Arthur C Clarke described Last and First Men as fantastic.As another reviewer pointed out, the first chapter describing the near future is not the best part of the book."
4,Buyer Beware,"Wanted to let everybody know that is planning on buying this that it shows only the first and second half. I guess sometime in the future they will release the four overtimes becuase on the menu is says Disc 1 of 2. I understand that but Amazon needs to let everybody know that this the case. I remember the game and it ran about 3 hours and 15 minutes, so it's hard to fit all that on DVD-R that gives ultimate quality and this game has that. The game quality looks like today's standards. I was impressed with that just dissapointed that the whole game wasn't there."
2,"Levels of Lead, Arsenic, Mercury & Cadmium are a concern","Muscle Milk has been one of my favorites, but some of the levels of heavy metals concerning. Consumer Reports July 2010 issue reported that Muscle Milk exceeded the USP levels of cadmium and lead, and also had arsenic and mercury. I will most likely choose another from now on."
2,"Vanilla flavor is okay, strawberry flavor is awful","Vanilla flavor: The taste of Muscle milk natural vanilla doesn't taste much like vanilla to me. Hardly even a hint of it. The powder mixes really well with liquids and tastes fine with milk but nothing to rave about. I probably won't order this product again.Strawberry: I can't quite describe how this stuff tastes but to me it is awful. It's almost a chemical taste. I haven't tasted the ""regular"" (non-natural) strawberry so I can't compare it to this stuff but I won't be buying muscle milk natural strawberry flavor again. I tried mixing this stuff with water, milk and even orange juice and it never tasted good or even drinkable. One positive thing I can say about this product is that it mixes easier than any protein powder i've used yet. To be fair I must say I haven't tasted many other strawberry flavored protein powders that tasted GREAT so maybe my palette is to blame."
5,Muscle Milk Mocha Latte,"This stuff really does the trick. I've only been using it for about a month and I've noticed more bulk and I've lost about 6 pounds of fat already. The major plus to the Mocha Latte flavor is that if you mix 2 scoops of it with a cup of black coffee, it tastes awesome! And it mixes extremely well with coffee. Almost no stirring. I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to lose pounds of fat WHILE adding muscle. Don't get me wrong as it is NOT a miracle worker. My results stem from 1 shake a day plus a healthy diet added to about 30 minutes of cardio workouts and 30 more minutes of weight training. Do that every day and I guarantee you'll see results too."
1,F!!)K this Phone.....!,"Accidently, detroyed my previous cell. So I ran to Sprint to replace it and the V3 caught my eye. I had a $200 coupon, so I went with the V3. A major f!!king mistake. The battery is deficient enough to be called 3rd world. The technologhy is juvenile and suffering; sought of like Sprint...! APPLE, here I come..."
2,"Looks nice, but...","This phone looks good. Sound quality is excellent. Battery life is average.My main problem is with the Transflash. My transflash card socket broke the third time I tried to use it. Of course, that was 8 days after the 30 day warranty had expired. I recommend buying the insurance, or never removing the flash card from the phone.On the plus side, Sprint told me that they would be willing to sell me a new phone if I wanted it!When working, the phone is nice. Sprint customer service is another story..."
2,Great phone but Sprint service is terrible.,"I could not place an international call from my RAZR. At the end of the day, Sprint found that my phone was defective. It took me 3 weeks of hassle and dozens of calls to unfriendly customer service to get the phone replaced. It is a great cell phone but Sprint service is terrible. You may want to consider buying a RAZR from Verizon."
1,Sprint is horrible,"I have no problem with the phone itself, but Sprint is the worst phone company on the face of the planet. I hate them. The world would be better if they went out of business. And if you think I'm a disgruntled ex-employee, I'm not. I'm their worst nightmare: a VERY disgruntled ex-customer. I would say that Sprint isn't really the worst PHONE company; they are, in my experience, the worst company of any kind ever to exist. The service I got from them was worse than horrible. If it had been slightly better, it would still have been sub-standard."
2,Not for my older children or elementary age,"I bought this hoping to use it at home with my third grader, and then thinking I could take it to school to use with some of the elementary students I work with as a school counselor. I was disappointed in the description not matching my needs/expectations. I feel it is for families or preschools to use with preschool age children. The games would fall flat with my family and a lot of the kids I work with for being too young/immature."
2,Some cute ideas,"This book suggests 50 activities for parents to teach children to feel safe & relaxed, respect boundaries, make requests, listen, take no for an answer, follow directions, acknowledge others, plan, make/keep agreements, cooperate, solve problems, and resolve conflict. Some of the games are original and useful, but many require two adults and various materials. Also, if you're a counselor buying this book, keep in mind that you'll probably have to tweak the activity to make it age-appropriate. And don't expect these activities to use up very much time."
1,Lousy performance but great in theory,If this thing really worked it would be great. The reality is that it's made of weak components and leaks like crazy when used. A simple spigot will save you water and frustration.
3,A little Disappointed in NJ,"I was kind of disappointed with this purchase. I searched around for the Troy doll for my daughter for Christmas this year and when the two dolls arrived I was so excited that she was going to have both Troy and Gabriella this year. However, when she opened them and began playing with them she wasn't as excited as I expected. I wasn't either. The dolls do sing but they do not sing together and if you don't press the buttom on their backs at the right time in sequence than the signing is completely off. Also, the tune that the two dolls sing to is completely different keys so it was a little disappointing. As far as playing with them as you would with any Barbie doll, they're great."
3,Alex Maupins little thoughts,"Jonah Werner has a talent like no one I have ever met, his carisma and joy create a blend of great works, Simple man, the secound of his rechords is wonderful! in any case, Ive been A Jonah fan From day one, So on a lighter note , hey everybody LISTEN UP! (You will love it, I promise!)-Alex"
4,Not-so-simple music,"I don't know Jonah, but after listening to this CD, I wish I could. It is one of the best CD's I've heard in a long time: combining excellent music with heart-felt lyrics. The music is honest and clean and, it seems to me, truly reflects the heart of a man wanting to serve God through his music. If you are looking for something new on the Christian music scene, you must give this CD a try."
1,total grabage,This game might have been good for its time just as FF before it..however I feel that this game lacks everything that made the FF series so famous...FUN. I had more trouble trying to figure out how to modify the graphic preferances and how to navigate my character than actually trying to figure out how to play the stupid game. And come on now..most fo the characters in the game look just outright retarded...but hey If you want a good game then play World of Warcraft or Elder scrolls 4...
1,This game sux,"Unfortunately there was no free trial of this (for good reason) so I had to waste $25 to buy it. Final Fantasy X and X2 graphics were better (heck even FF7 on some aspects). The usual battle system everyone is used to from the series (turn based mostly) is non-existent here (sad that they just copied off every other MMO). Overall other than the names of some items in game and the game itself (potion, megalixir, etc.) it just didn't feel Final Fantasyish. If I could rate it a negative star I would. The good thing that came of this is it made me search for another MMO and led me to Saga Of Ryzom, unlimited free trial and best game out at the moment."
1,This game isn't worth buying.,"I have played many MMORPG's on the internet, and by far, this was a huge let down, I've played all the version's of Final Fantasy, and loved them all, Until I baught the internet edition, What a huge let down."
1,disapointed,We returned the game intact because we needed 80.00 in graphic cards to play it. In all we spent 29.00 plus 6.00 shipping ups back to Amazon and all we got in return was a 15.00 credit card credit. I am very disapointed in the money I lost and invested in one day. It makes me think about ever purchasing anything again from amazon.Peggy Greisinger
1,MMOs are the devil,"I have absolutely not desire to play this game, now or ever. I purchased it for my Final Fantasy collection only."
2,More quotations,I was looking for some uplifting and moder quotations to help those who are grieving the loss of their spouse.
5,Best in my colllection,"This is by far the best Zen music disc I've purchased. Most Shakuhachi music is made up of short, sharp bursts from the flute and gasps for air from the flutist, and most of those bursts don't add up to a good tune (in my opinion). In contrast, all the tunes in this album flow like water, without being at all Yanni-like. I especially like the second disc, and I listen to it at work to calm me down, especially when I'm doing some problem solving."
1,"Nice pictures, but that's all ....",The values he places on machines are ridiculous and of absolutely no use to any serious collector. Lots of wishful thinking on the author's part as to the scarcity and value of any of these machines!
4,It's very good for the price,"It's very good for the price, depending on the instrument you may spend a bit more and buy a radial one. I think for keyboard and electric bass is ok. For more complicated instruments better to spend more money and go for a radial one."
3,relational,"This was a good portrial of a christian gay relationship. I was however hoping for deeper intermacy (not sexual) between the two; their interpersonal relationship apart from the misic. And how close friends and family members who are christian understood their journey. However, it is a good movie to begin discussions with christians with family members who are gay."
4,People need to take a battery charging class...,"I see a lot of griping about the battery life on these tools... perhaps thats because folks couldn't be relied upon to read a manual to learn how to charge a battery. I find this set to be awesome for just about any armature project. Reciprocal saw can cut through a 1inch steel pole [not pipe but poll] with ease and doesn't need a battery swap or recharge after a complete job. I bought mine new and have had it for 5+ years now. For a vary long time we did not have lithium batteries. I wonder how rechargeable devices sold? Oh thats because people recharged them properly. I bet you lot have issues with your cell phone batteries too. Good product, follow the 'laws' of physics and chemistry and maybe your batteries will last a long while."
1,DeeRibatibve.,"This stuff trys way too hard and it stinks. hey lets sound quirky! ok. Hey lets sound like built to spilly! ok. man were rock visionaries! yeah we are. From what I understand they are from Norman ok, and just for that there credebility should be placed under inspection."
3,Joy!,"This record is a really fun. I think that's the best way todescribe it. ...The style is pretty unique, but a good point of reference would be The Flaming Lips meet Beulah..."
5,Awesome band!!,"Haha...My 4th grade teachers daughter and her husband are i this band...It is awesome...sort of a mixture on the Beatles and something else...She had Disc 2 with popsickle and pusher girls on it and showed me the video for popsickle...funnier than i dont know what...Buy this CD...for me, im burnin it...All songs are awesome!! Good Luck Starlight Mints!!"
3,incorrect information...,"i very much like the starlight mints... however, i ordered this album expecting to get the version described in the 'album description' under 'editorial reviews.' i was disappointed when my order arrived.this is NOT the two disc version with the bonus tracks and video.if you don't care about the extra tracks and video, go ahead and order it. it's a good album. 4.5 stars, well worth $12.but if you are interested in the bonuses, as i was, then look elsewhere."
4,These Mints are very refreshing,"Do yourself a favour, rush out and buy this CD right now. Starlight Mints should be in everyone's record collection, only because you're unlikely to own anything like this one. Eccentric doesn't begin to describe this tidy collection of songs, which upon listening to it makes me think of what might happen if a bunch of literate if slightly unbalanced lovers of pop music were left to their own devices. Throw in a violin and cello and what you have is probably the most off-beat record of the year."
4,Pinch Me,"I must be dreaming. This is simply the most refreshing musical beverage I've enjoyed for some time now. Had the fortune of receiving a promo CD with Submarine & Sir Prize and ordered the full album a week later. I laughed, I cried, it was spectacular. A definite must-buy-now if your album rotation is getting old."
3,Great Overview But Lacks Detail,"This book will provide the reader with a great overview of what mastering is all about but it fails to give any detail on the subject. If you want a summary of what mastering is then this book just may be worth it for you. The glossary of terms alone may be worth the price of the book! If you're looking for something more detailed, skip it!"
3,"For ten bucks, I highly recommend it.","This book is a small palm-size book which you can read in several hours. It reads well, the advice is sound and I found the answers to several questions, and several other suspicions (common sense items) were confirmed.This book packs a whallop for the size it comes in. I would like to see this be a real 8.5 x 11 book. It was a heck of a lot more interesting that the ""CD Home audio course"" which I am returning. I'm keeping this one.This book proves size does not matter. The content is solid and he didn't fill up a bunch of pages with common sense junk.Could use more illustrations, but then again it is a perspective book not a tutorial."
3,Ok for the price,"The book has some good tips but tends to be quite redundant. Several points are repeated over and over throughout the book, with a good edit it could be stripped down to at least two thirds of the size keeping the same content."
3,Not so great,"I just got these today, they are pretty narrow, not comfortable to sit in but i think it's because the seat is small, the back felt fine, They even rock on the floor and my floor is even. The seat cushion is a cheap micro fiber that leaves finger prints when you touch it. however on a positive side they were easy to put together and from far away they look great but get up close and sit on them and they feel cheap. well I guess you get what you pay for and maybe for the price they are just ok."
5,OUTSTANDING CHAIRS & GREAT PRICE,I ordered these chairs for my mother's birthday. She needed 6 chairs so it was perfect that these came in pairs. I got her some outstanding chairs at a great price and she loves them.
5,eccellent condition,The chair are very nice and they look so good in my kitchen now that i am alone i don't need a big table and chairs so that why i ordered these and these chair are just perfect for me. I recommend this product to everyone who is single and if has a family :)
5,Great Chairs,Very easy and quick to put together. I bought them because I need smaller chairs as my kitchen is small. They were perfect in every way! ...I'm big guy 6'2' 190 lbs and they support me and I have plenty of room to sit. Also they came very fast and very hight quality.
5,Great Chairs for the Price,These are great chairs for the price. They arrived on time and in great condition. Would highly recommend them.
2,Terrible Quality,"Have had these chairs for less than a year and we already need to replace them. They are broken and/or falling apart. The tops of the chairs have broken off more times than I can count and the legs are all wobbly and falling apart now too. They looked really nice when I first got them, but that didn't last. They still look nice if you can avoid looking at all the broken pieces and lopsided legs. Don't buy these chairs!!!"
1,Poor Service,"It's the 11th of November and Thanksgiving is around the corner..... Got a nice new table for the family to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner around but I had to order chairs. I found this product on Amazon and thought it would be a good fit for my table. I placed the order and followed the shipping request. Amazon offered free 3 to 5 day shipping. Unfortunately, the company reported on my tracking that it didn't get picked up by Fedex until the 21st with a delivery of 23rd. The 23rd came and gone but no chairs. Fedex and Amazon changed the tracking report to pick up on 24th with a delivery of 28th. I guess I just have to sit here and take it. Oh crap! I dont have chairs!!!!!! I will have to stand the hole time. Bad business......."
2,One big plot problem,"I was thoroughly enjoying this book until page 98 where it fell apart. The hero, tortured so terribly by his captors in the Sudan, can't stand to be touched. A problem since he does desire the heroine. She too finds him very desireable. So much so that her magic powers run wild as she imagines touching him. He feels her unseen fingers, yet isn't repulsed by the touch. Great. BUT SHOULDN'T HE REALIZE ON PAGE 98 THAT HE NO LONGER HAS A PROBLEM? Perhaps the author should have seen that as well."
1,cheap,"I wanted to purchase this item because of my experience with an Acu-Rite Weather Instrument. Bad choice. This item doesn't give me the temperature accurately, is hard to work with, and has shabby craftsmanship. I do not recommend it."
3,Ok - but not life-changing,"There's some useful stuff in this book. Reading it made me optimistic I can get a handle on my occasional Basil Fawlty-style eruptions of rage. But what's with all the exclamation marks? Every chapter is littered with them, two, three, sometimes four to a page. It's infuriating! Makes my blood boil! Are you trying to wind me up, Gael Lindenfield?! You're certainly going about it the right way!"
4,"Entertaining, with a good [lesson]",This is a good story about consequences of exaggerating and lying. It emphasizes the importance of telling the truth.
5,One of my favorites,"Sandra is an awesome person!! I first heard her at a Caedmon's Call concert and wasn't sure what to expect. After the first song I new I would love her! She has an incredible voice and her style is great. If you are a fan of Caedmon's Call you are sure to love her! I am looking forward to seeing a lot more of Sandra! Buy it, this is GOOD music!!"
5,The Recovery Spiral is Excellent for Helpers,"When using this book, I found the suggestions carefully worded, to guide yet not offend. Of particular value are the many times where the author creates comfort, that there is no wrong way, but does emphasize there may be no evil intent."
1,unreadable.,I don't know what she was trying to do with the bio's. I was so hopeful about this book. It offered me nothing. Terrible. Very disappointed.
4,Give Justin a chance.,"I'm not sure why Justin Rosolino doesn't have a huge following by now: his voice is great, his lyrics are personal, and for live recordings, ""Music"" sounds polished, yet it still retains emotion. My favorite track is ""My Kinda Love."""
1,Booooo!!!,"I was looking for a way to extend my patio seating when I bought this table. First off, it arrived in a damaged carton that some lame person thought they could hide by taping a piece of cardboard over the gash. I couldn't refuse the shipment because it was just dumped on my doorstep. Secondly, it was broken when we took it out of the box. When my husband fixed the damage with some wood glue and tried to set it up all of the joints came apart and he had to re-glue them. Worst waste of money I have ever spent on anything on Amazon!!!!! Shame on you Teak Furniture Gallery. You should go out of business!!!!"
4,Addiction tale with a positive outcome,"As a Darwianian scholar, I'm always fascinated by anything Darwin, so I picked up this book. William Pryor, Darwin's great-great grandson grew up in a world of priveldge that few will ever comprehend. Yet he felt empty and his search for fulfilment and identity took him into the world of hardcore drug addiction at the height of the beatnik movement. He 'hung out' with some of the biggest names in rock and roll forever searching for the illusive answers. When he finally hit rock bottom, and opted for a 'clean' life he found at least a portion of the identity he had been seeking. His recovery has allowed him to build a successful business career as a renowned entrepreneur in Britain and gives him the right to discuss drug-addiction and recovery from a vantage point that few of us ever want to know. This book should be required reading by all those in the recovery field and anyone who was ever baffled by the illure of illicet drugs."
5,Garden Greens Acaisplash Juice Concentrate 30oz,This is very good tasting even without adding water. It is the first fruit-only drink I have come across so far. I will be buying this again.
4,The gastronomic memoirs of Ludwig Bemelmans,"The book is a charming and witty evocation of the gourmet world of Ludwig Bemelmans. The collection of essays, accompanied by the author's illustrations and interspersed with menus acquired throughout the world, carries us behind the scenes at some of the world's finest restaurants, to the table with gourmets of all types, and into the gastronomic imagination of the author of the Madeline series. If you want to experience a distant era of luxury, elegance and overindulgence, from a perspective laced with delight and satire, you will be thoroughly delighted."
4,It's like being in one of her classes!,"Having been a student of joan's and new to dreamwork three years ago, this book brought back many insights and aha's. while reading about dreams isn't as fun as being in her classes, the book is easy to understand and a valuable tool for interpreting your own dream images. empowering."
5,This is a great book. I enjoy it very much!,"I enjoy this book very much. I read it nearlyevery day as a positive supportive pick me up.365 Daily Positive Thoughts For Happiness,Comfort, and Encouragement, I recommended thisfor sure."
3,Contemplative and erratic,"I sought this book because I myself play in winter and around ice and love the cold as it defines seasons. I am an environmental advocate in my job and hobbies. I also am an admirer of the destinations and distances Ehrlich seems willing to travel.While I appreciate the imagery and Ehrlich's personalized - yet detached - account of her experiences throughout this book, I didn't find myself empathizing with most of her ideas and principles. The strong impression this book left on me was of a bag of personal troubles couched as a concern for climate change. I don't know if she was numbed by her feeling of helplessness, against what she perceived in the world of ice (or if she was just cold) but her stream-of-consciousness verse-prose cascade toward no solutions was alienating and disheartening. I didn't want a feel good story from this book, but I think I had hoped for a sense of stepping toward reconciliation and trouble-shooting, however philosophical."
5,The Future of Ice,"When I pick up a book that allows me to live vicariously through the author, I never forget it. This was the case with Solace of Open Places and now, years later, with The Future of Ice. A poet bear's witness to the conditions that make up this world; the conditions that manifest both the almost unbearable suffering of this planet and all of the living things on it--and, at the same time and never separate--the overwhelming joy of being alive. A beautifully descriptive book of the heart."
1,Nice design - - - Crappy performance!,From the outset I liked the slightly movable design of the stem of these suction cups. Unfortunately they won't stick to the glass. If they won't do that ............... what's the use.
5,Kennedy captures the era with flair,"London Belle is fast paced, emotional, and captures the era to a tee. Shirley's characters are well drawn and she has a knack for surprising her reader. I enjoyed her first book ""Lady Semple's Secret"" and loved ""London Belle"" even more. Who could resist a story of fortunes lost, family secrets, castle ruins, a jeweled chalice that brings out the best and the worst in those who possess it, and a rogue hero to die for? With each book, Shirley becomes a stronger writer and more engrossing storyteller. If you like Regency, ""London Belle"" is a must read."
2,Speaking of shallow...,"The main character is often referred to as shallow, fitting for a book that is just the same. The characters are unlikable and the plot is unrealistic; there is no depth to either. The story itself has no substance. The ending is predictable and treacly- something a young teenager would write (or thoroughly enjoy reading.) The Kindle version has spelling and grammatical errors that I found distracting. Very dissatisfied with this book."
3,So-So Story Without Much Heat,"There's nothing really bad about London Belle but there's nothing really great about it either. The story is about a 19-year old girl who takes on the burden of saving her family because her father abandoned them after a gambling loss. Of course, she's helped and saved by a reformed rake who also happens to be a widower with a son. The characters are predictable, the plot is predictable, the dialogue is predictable, and the almost non-existent sex scenes are luke warm and boring. I can tolerate a book that has a lot of average characteristics if the author gives me at least one thing that I enjoy. Unfortunately, Kennedy doesn't deliver. London Belle is okay at best."
2,"Good Info, Little ""How to""","This book contains some good information (scales, arpeggios, double stops, chop chords, chord progressions) and several sample licks. What it does not do, however, is actually tell the player ""How to"" apply all of this information. As an advanced beginner at the mandolin, this was not helpful at all. There is no real instruction on improvising, but perhaps instructing on how to improvise is a paradox."
5,FANTASTIC,"This season was awesome and I'm really hoping for a third season. It is a fantastic show with an incredible ending. I hope they continue on with the cliffhanger. Acting is great, action is great, and I bet if they had more time and money then they could expand it to make it a huge production!"
4,pure good si fi,hello! for those whom like SI FI this is a good show l have seen only first and part of the 2nd season but l like it and l boost mr david strathairn its always great!!
4,Alphas Season 2 Sneak Peak,"I watched this preview because it was free and I had watched the first season on instant streaming through a different site. If there had been a charge for this sneak peak, I wouldn't have watched it. Alphas is an interesting show, kind of like Heroes and No Ordinary Family. The sneak peak just gives you a sense of what's coming in season 2. It's kind of like dipping your toe into the water to see how cold it is. But, you really don't have the sense of just how cold that water is until you throw your whole body in."
3,too heavy on the drama,"I watch this series for its action and fantasy/scifi aspects. This episode is loaded down with interpersonal drama, hand-wringing and an especially touchy-feely sex scene. In fact, there's a lot of touchy-feely, chick flick stuff in it. If that's your cup of tea, fine. And some such is more or less expected in this day and age. However, this episode is way too full of it. Given my personal preferences, if it were not for a very intriguing alpha related plot element, I would have given this episode 2 stars and I would be feeling a lot of concern about the future direction of the show."
4,End of episode missing.,The quality of the series has been excellent..up to this episode..it does not come to an appropriate ending..just stops nearly mid sentence!
4,ALPHAS SEASON 2,I enjoyed this show since the first season and look forward to more seasons to come. I like how the characters feed off of each others power. I like the chemistry between Nina and Hicks.
4,Warning I am a sucker for David Strathairn,Alphas is full of normal folks with super powers in one particular area. They are flawed. No perfect endings. I love that they have a person with a disability (autism?) who contributes and is not treated like a mascot.
5,Good bye Alpha,Really liked this series. Sorry to see it go. Seems like they don't give some shows a chance or there is not enough advertising.
1,2 minutes?,"It is bad enough that for a Monday night show, you have to wait until Wednesday night to get this, but then only 2 minutes! Where is the rest?"
2,Not that Great.,I had high hopes for this but it just seems to average and plain in it delivery and viewing experience to make you care if you come back week after week.
3,"Alphas Season 2, Episode ""If Memory Serves""","This was a good episode. It was nice to see a familiar face as a guest star. However, I always wish Malik Yoba would have more of a presence or positive impact in the episodes."
4,I can't believe that I just found Alphas... and now it's cancelled!,"Don't get me started on how frustrating it is to see a fun, exciting, interesting, compelling show get cancelled! Argh! Please watch both seasons, they are worth it. Just be prepared to be angry at the end of Season 2... which has a GREAT cliffhanger! I really hope that they decide to follow up with a 2-hour finale or something... let's face it, only more episodes would suffice. Great show!"
4,Alphas was great! Can't wait for the next season.,"I just loved Season 2 of Alphas. The characters were more developed and humanized. Gary, of course, was my favorite. The season finale was the only let down. It was a little unbelievable and disappointing - especially if they don't return for another season. I hope they do."
4,real imagination,"truely one of a kind, great writing and down to earth persons that you can feel for,great show and would recommend it to any one."
5,Alphas Sci-Fi Series,"I absolutely love this show! The characters are well-developed and the story lines are nail biters! This better come back for another season, or at least a movie to let us know what happens!!!"
4,An Great Season For An Great Tv Show-),Well i really liked this tv shows second seasonand at the end of this shows second season garywas the only one standing from what i can clearlyremember and now i waiting on what happens in thethird season and hope that this shows stays alive.
4,intense episode,Enjoyed this show! It was intense with good action. This episode left me with anticipation for the next week episode.
5,Need to know?,"The title says it all. We all need to know, how much knowledge has always been a question much debated. If we ate limited in what we know, we are also limited in our ability to reason. Then ask yourself, if reason is important, is knowing necessary?"
3,"A watered-down X-Men, but entertaining none the less",They're mutants without the magnitude of powers of the X-Men or the superhero costumes. The story still works as a small makeshift team of mutants employed by the US govt. battle against a massive organization of evil mutants set to reshape the Earth in the imaginations of their deadly mutant ruler.
4,Great show,Entertaining and clever. The drama meter is sometimes cranked to 11 and I still can't decide if i like Dr. Summers. He seems conflicted beyond the storyline. Otherwise it's a great show and I am absolutely hooked!
4,I Love this series!,"This episode really brought out the best in the characters, and highlighted the tensions brought out by the sudden exposure of Alphas to the world. I love the intricate nature of the plotting of these shows, and how they arc across several episodes while each individual episode stands alone."
3,The show is not as entertaining as the first season,"This series has become too 'conflict intensive'. This is destroying the entertainment value of the series. Red Flag's murderous and destructive propensities are far too intense for this subject material. Little less love making, and more 'wins' for the FBI and the alpha team and a couple more episodes with Skylar would be a lot more fun for the viewer, in my very humble opinion."
3,"Not much to drool over, but fun like the game.","Thing is, I couldn't imagine how someone would put the game's content into novel form. And after reading the novel, I still can't. This was a really quick read, and it had sort of a superficial bite to it. None of the characters are really worth caring about, and it doesn't go into much detail about the technologies or species of aliens. But none of that really matters much; I don't think anyone was expecting a masterpiece here.If ya liked the game, you'll probably have fun with the book."
4,"Xcom, a good game, now a good book","This book fits in nicely with the game. If you were interested and enjoyed the gameplay, this book will also entertain you. It takes you right along as if you were in a mission of the game. It could stand to be more descriptive, and perhaps some more character development. BUT as it stands, it is very entertaining, and I think works well with the Xcom saga."
4,X-Com: an exciting and enjoyable read,"Although I have never played the game, X-Com, I found this book to be very fun and exciting to read, and particularly enjoyed the geographic descriptions of the locales. It felt as though the writers had either spent some time there, or else done their research very well.It was not all rosy, of course; there could have been a bit more description of some of the aliens and some of the starships; some of it felt as though it relied upon the reader's prior experience with the game. But all in all, the book was exciting, action-packed, and a real page-turner, and kept me guessing right up to the end as to who the traitor really was. I definitely recommend it."
1,Pretty bad,"It was a pretty boring book with cardboard characters, non-descript situations and tedious pacing. While the game was pretty good, it had no plot onto which to latch a book.Remember the nondescript paper doll-like agents you use? The book will give you the same feeling about the characters, only there is no sense of dread in the missions."
2,Thin,"Not only is the book itself thin, the plot and the characters are too. How thin? Well let me say that sometimes the game mechanics shine through them. If you are looking for true Sci-Fi, or anything heavier than a McDonalds' Value meal, look elsewhere. Unless you are nostalgic for the video game, or need something to fill out your time in the bathroom then this book may be worth a read. Personally, I recommend finding something meatier."
4,A fun departure from typical fantasy.,"This is not your typical high-fantasy. In fact, it's close to low fantasy. Brust writes realistic characters. The differences between the two races, Easterners and Dragaeran's is delved into and becomes an intrinsic element in this world. Vlad seems real as a fantasy character. It's refreshing to read a story where the 'hero' has limits, and must rely on a little help from his friends. The world feels fully realized, although the reader does not get more than a glimpse into its geography. Highly reccomended read for anybody looking for a fun read that's outside the norm for the genre. My only problem is the lack of maps, or better explained geography. The city of Adrilankha seems too complex to not have that reference."
5,Start of a Great Series,"This book is the first in an outstanding fantasy series, one of the best of the many I have read. The world (creatures, magic system, races, etc.) is extremely creative and Vlad, the protagonist, is complex and interesting. He is fearless (and sometimes ruthless) in achieving his goals (generally over incredible odds). Although the timeline gets a bit convoluted as the series continues, the trip through Vlad's life is an entertaining ride."
5,one of the best fantasies of all time,"This book includes a colorfully depicted gaggle of flawed but still heroic protaganists, a beuatifly described setting, and a plot so thick and twisty that one may as well call it jacks magic beanstock. it's a good book"
5,Great blend of fantasy and mystery in the style of Dumas,"I have been reading fantasy novels all of my life and this author is in my top three. Brust's non-formulaic writing style is extremely intelligent and witty with a unique panache and flair. His novels have a much greater share of dialogue than usual - and what great dialog it is! He is not afraid to spend many pages on a lengthy debate or an inconsequential funny moment.Once you have graduated by reading the Taltos series, take on the Phoenix Guard series which is a pleasant interlude from standard fantasy fare. It takes flowery speech to a wonderfully hysterical level but still has his usual underlying mystery/investigative theme. :)"
5,The Best Introduction to Traditional Woodworking,This book is a classic! It is difficult to think of anything to add to the other reviews so I'll just say that if you have an interest in traditional woodworking get this book. You will not be disappointed!
4,Easy to follow,"I like this book because it is informative and entertaining. The techniques are easy to follow and to carry out. There's lots of history, which I love, and quirky information as well, which I also love."
4,It Surprised Me,"Alright so I was wrong about MTT: I assumed his disposition towards making music sound ""hippie"" would never work. But here is obviously does. As the reviewer above acknowledges, this disc is helped greatly by the excellent sound. But still: it is vigorous, well performed, and worth an all-round applause. It is also a very mainstream performance that you could get for your friends who are not-so-inclined towards classical music. It may not be as academic as Gardiner (excellent though that performance is), but it certainly is more exciting.And ""hippie""."
5,Excellent Clock!,"This is a very nice, substantial clock. The beveled edge wood trim looks great; it's easy to read; is quiet; the mechanism is inset in the back, which allows the clock to be more flat against the wall. All this - and it keeps great time, too! We have it in our kitchen and it blends very well with our oak cabinetry."
3,YOU CAN HEAR IT TICKING,I had heard that this Selko clock did not make noise[tick-tick-tick] WRONG when it is quit in the room you can hear it tick
1,Good for the kids. Horrible on the feet.,"When you reach the 10th or so time stepping on one of these little babies, you'll throw the whole thing out...like I did. Save your money and your sanity."
1,Unreliable,"Claims to have AC detection. In use the AC live wire detection warning is constantly beeping. While the AC alarm is active, the unit doesn't find any studs. The instructions claim that the sensor may be influenced by live wires up to 18"" away. The suggested method for dulling the sensitivity is to either place your other hand on the wall near the sensor or hold the unit 1/2 "" off the wall. When you do this, the AC detection doesn't fire and it classifies studs as studs and live wires as studs. Essentially the live wire detection is useless and only serves to confuse the sensor. In the end I resorted to traditional methods of finding the studs. This contraption will be heading back for a refund."
4,MOSTLY GOOD,"I like this interactive game quite a bit. Love that you have to swing a club.So far though the controller seems a little inaccurate.I intentionally make inside-out slice swings and it says it is a perfect swing. And this is in Pro mode. Sometimes the ball goes straight when I make intentional crazy swings.Then when I know I made a good swing, sometimes the shot goes off line and says I made bad contact. I'll have to experiment more on this.You can't line up your putts so you have to trust the game that the putting line is accurate.Even with these flaws, I still like the game a lot."
1,Awful,"This game is really too much trouble to play. My husband took it out of the box once. He prefers the golf game that's part of Wii Sports. No wires, no fuss."
4,A Magical Story.,"The poor little shepherd boy, Lucas, was blinded by lightning. He sang in the nuns' nativity play as a member of the angel choir. An adorable dog helped care for him in the abbey during the Christmas season. Some local pranksters hid his sheep, who then escaped into the forest. In the end, Lucas regained his sight because of snow, which usually never fell in his area. I saw this on TV today and was charmed by it. A hartwearming, enchanting Christmas story."
1,Big letdown,"This book was a huge disappointment to me. If the reader has any background in Telecommunications avoid this book.The book reads well but the technologies mentioned lack depth and just skim the surface, barely mentioning topics at times. Explanations are repetitive and if the reader expects details stay away from this book."
1,"Awful, just awful","The author has a tendency to go on tangents, such as describing for a full page how globalization has swept the economy, or the history of the PC leading up to the advent of the internet. He spends more time justifying technologies than showing their merit."
2,Waste of money,"This book is way too detailed in some chapters, and way too superficial in others. It's also very repetitive, so it's a pain to read."
3,Who is the target audience?,"In his desire to attract as many readers as possible, the author got carried away with verbose explanations of sometimes unrelated matters. I failed to imagine a typical reader of the book: there are chapters for those completely unaware of digital telephony and packet data. So the book is more a mediocre manual on telecoms in general best fit for a freshman of business administration. I would also think that a telecom regulator could find useful a chapter or two, but for that kind of person I would recommend getting a first-hand, free-of-charge experience by visiting corresponding pages of an ITU website."
4,Excellent Read,"I had to read this book as part of the Organizational Communication class at Penn State Abington. I was very skeptical at first, since most of the text books I need I rarely read or enjoy. To my surprise I read the book from cover to cover and thoroughly enjoyed it. Let me state, that I am a non traditional student and could really relate the chapter concepts to my work experiences. This is one book that I will not be returning at the end of the semester. Two Thumbs Up!!"
4,Required Reading but I liked it.,The book served its purpose. Provides a good foundation for communication tools to use and I found the strategic scenario at the beginning of each chapter a pleasure to read.
5,Stat Comm Review,This book is nothing short of fantastic. I would seriously advise anyone in business or any other communication intensive activity (just about all of us) to read this book.The advice and exercises are truly worthy of the time one must invest.
4,Several great tunes here,"There are several great tunes here, especially the Berber song on the second disc (from the High Atlas). Sung with a lot of passion. Listen to the sample for that song!"
1,"Please, stay away from this book.","You will not learn anything from this book. The author twists simple material into cabalistic abstractions by adding ramification where not needed and the converse of course holds for formidable notions; as to why this is, one might reason for of the sake of original presentation of well established mathematical concepts, moreover the result: unworthy compilation of simple ideas, presented in an amateurish way - arduous to understand. Hence, summing up: A WASTE OF TIME."
2,I hated this book.,"The material is actually put forth in a pretty easy to understand way, but the problem is that the material is very difficult - and the back of the book provides absolutely zero answers. This resulted in me, more than once, thinking that I had an idea or concept understood and completing my homework, only to find on quiz or test day that I had the wrong idea.Teachers, please do not assign this book! Or if you absolutely must assign this book, at least make sure to go over the homework in class."
2,Forget the Medicus and take some lessons,"Could possibly be helpful, but it was wasted money for me. Was shooting in the low 100's two years ago, now I'm shooting in the 80's after a series of 18 lessons with a great teaching pro from Chelmsford, Massachusetts."
5,A Classic,"This was the first romanace novel I ever read, and it is still one of my favorites. The characters pocess wit and humor. It the classic damsal in distress novel, which I happen to like. I recomend it. Leigh is fabulous."
5,Wonderful!,"I purchased this as a gift for my father and he absolutely loved it! He loves nature and traveling DVDs, but I often have trouble finding ones he does not already own or seen. However, this one he hadn't seen and he was excited to receive this. My sisters bought him the other DVDs that go with this one. What a perfect gift! The item shipped very quickly too."
1,Don't buy!!!!,Fell apart in a couple of weeks!!! Lining wore out in moderate use. Large whole in sole. I wondered why it was taking on water.
1,Not for 2000 Cherokee,Says it fits a 2000 cherokee but the manifold gasket does not fit. the holes for the exhaust ports are to large and they let air escape.
2,Average Performer,"Average performance. Was disappointed in the video quality, which was plagued with constant interferance (from my 802.11g/n wireless network router in close proximity). Camera was approximately 25 feet from receiver. Have bought other cameras/systems and the best indoor surveillance system thus far has been from Logitech, which was easy to setup and uses an A/C plug for transmitting video (interferance-free)."
3,A real pleaser...,"This was the first Loretta Lynn album I ever owned, and her first in the digital age. Ironically, it has never been officially released on CD. Too bad, because it's got good production and solid songs. Lynn scored her last top-20 hit with the single, ""Heart, Don't Do This To Me,"" but there is stronger material here that was never rightly heard, like ""Wouldn't It Be Great"" and the title track, along with the fun opener, ""Stop The Clock."" I sure hope MCA will give this album an official release on CD along with some of her other back catalog."
5,Slipknot Who??,"With all of the hardcore bands who have come and gone, none have ever been as memorable as Pissing Razors. This is by far their best album. Their music is fast, heavy, and original. This is an older album and currently all of the members have quit. There are only 3 new members left and i haven't heard of any upcoming album realeses from these guys. I would definatly like to see these guys make a comeback."
3,"More like 2.5, but I'll be generous","What's with all this ""Heavy as Hell!!!"" reviews? Anyone who thinks this is beyond heavy doesn't listen to enough heavy music. Check out Satyricon's Rebel Extravaganza or Cryptopsy's Whisper Supremacy or even Slayer's Reign In Blood (recorded 15 years before this) for some real heavy stuff.But being really heavy doesn't automatically make music good, just as not being so heavy doesn't make music bad. But I can honestly say that this is not that good. Much of the guitar work is simple and there are no solos. This would be OK if the music had a good feel (once again, see Satyricon or many other black metal bands), but this reeks of unoriginality and has no real feel. If you like Death metal then this won't be heavy enough. If you like black metal then this doesn't sound anything like it. If you like technicality look elsewhere.It isn't hectic, it isn't brutal and it isn't original. So if you want something heavy then buy something else."
1,It's still the same old story....,"This collection of previously published ""essays"" by the self-absorbed poet and celebrity-seeker about town demonstrates, if nothing else, Koestenbaum's remarkable talent for turning absolutely anything and everything around so that it's about HIM. Really scraping here is a NY Times mag piece about His dreams about movie queens, which reads as if it were dashed off while he was filing his nails or something. Plus other skin-crawling, mind-boggling mis-uses of prose about Melanie Griffith, Liz Taylor (she makes Him feel like a man -- imagine that -- but please, spare us the imagery), and other godawful ramblings. This guy should have taken a cue from Kate Hepburn and just called this book ""Me."" You'll want to take a very hot shower after reading this. But it's doubtful you'll be able to dispel the icky feeling it gives with just water...."
3,"Oh, so disappointing","Reading Shampoo Planet is like a good news/bad news deal. I love Coupland--Microserfs, Life After God, Miss Wyoming, and Coma, are all good reads...some excellent. The good news is that he has matured and grown as a writer. The bad news is that Shampoo planet is majorly disappointing. Perhaps I expected too much--maybe the 10 years has dated the novel--but it just doesn't work. The characters are rather two dimensional...the revelations are like the infomericals that Stephanie auditions for. I kept reading and reading hoping it would get better. It did not. It had a few fine moments and interesting scenes. Coupland had not yet found his voice. I should have known I was in trouble when ""Elle"" gave the biggest blurb. It gets three stars because of some very funny moments and that zeitgeist voice of Coupland--but you are better off with any of his other books. I hope that GenX proves a better read. This one is like Shampoo in your eyes."
5,Very Nicely Done Trip With 20-somethings!,"This is a very fine multi-generational tour with the junior college crowd in the town of Lancaster, Wa., with stops in Paris, Vancouver, and LA. A very funny ride that you'll breeze through! We go thru half-vanished malls, trailor parks, grandfathers busted in bad real estate deals who sell multilevel cat food, a very loving ex-hippie mother, and a vacuous stepfather, and other eccentrics of all ages. Well worth the ride and the time!"
1,A really bad book,"I found Coupland's first book, ""Generation X"" a total bore, but at least in that book there was some really lovely writing. Not so here. ""Shampoo Planet"" is just a terrible book. With it's pretentious mock ""Periodic Table"" on the inside covers and inevitable angst-ridden young adults, this book just came across as hackwork. Coupland had a hit with ""Gen X"" and so he apparently pumped out this tired, flaccid tale of rich twentysomethings with girl problems and guy problems and blah blah blah. Coupland has shown that he can turn a nice phrase, but the two books of his I read bored me to tears, especially since I bought the doggone things."
2,Wash this book out of my hair!,"Once Again, Dougy Coupland bores the reader stiff page by deadening page. Witless, vapid and uncouth. ""Generation X"" had its moments, but enough is enough: Shave and go home, Dougy! END"
2,Pretty blah,"I liked Microserfs, I wasn't impressed with Shampoo Planet. Although a member of ""Gen X,"" I didn't feel very connected to any of the characters, like them, or feel like I had much in common with them. The only thing I really liked was the tragic money, but that doesn't make the book very good. I'd recommend Microserfs over this book any day, but I'm not certain Coupland is a must read."
1,One of the Most Pretentious Books I've Read,"Tyler and his friends are nothing but a bunch of stupid teens trying hard to be grown-ups when in fact you can't even find a single hint that they have alrealy developed a sense of maturity. I can't find any character in the story who is realistic enough . This novel doesn't even describe the life and struggles of the real North American teenager. I didn't care for a single character in this novel. And the conversations here are really moronic. Had Tyler existed in real life, I could have beat him up to death for being such a smartass in disguise"
3,Interesting Book if you can handle not liking anyone in it.,"With all the Hype around Gen X, I assumed that this book would have to fall short of modern writing expectations. After all you don't get hit by lighting twice. Douglas Coupland has a unique way of saying alot without having much plot happening at all. Responding to these other reviews, I think that the reader who cares little about the self absorbed characters and their self made problems, will be most likly to respond well to it. The characters in this book are post teens who have expected life to be handed over to them at some point,with no work on their part, and are disailusioned when it isn't. You don't have to like this lifstyle and mindset though, to see the ideas Coupland is trying to get across."
3,not his best by far,"There are those who call Coupland the Salinger of the 2nd half of the 20th century. I sincerely hope those people didn't read Shampoo Planet. I ended up enjoying the book quite a bit, but compared to Life After God or Microserfs, this is far from Coupland's best work."
4,Life changes and moving on in order to grow up-- it hit home,"As I finished reading this book in the back of a warehouse -- one of the several McJobs I held down at the time -- I wept. Some may not be moved as I was, but not everybody has the same reference points that allow them to see parallels between Tyler's life and their own. Tyler's experience, I have to think, is similar to many in their mid-20s. It is a time when you decide what you're really going to do with your life, determine what is really important to you, move on and grow up if you have to. Sometimes you realign your goals to grow up. Sometimes you leave your girlfriend -- no matter how hard -- to grow up. Tyler's shift in hair care products symbolizes his... oh well read the book for that.I liked Shampoo Planet. It wasn't Catcher In The Rye, but it was my World and I think many who are orbiting in that same lifestage will relate to it too."
3,"Yes, Victoria, this really is what it's like","It isn't ""Mao II,"" but then again, it isn't ""The Runaway Jury,"" either. As someone who was Tyler's age at the time of publishing, Coupland scarily gets into my brain and prints my thoughts. Love it or hate it, this is what modern, suburban, upper-middle class youth think about. Here are their thoughts, their fears, and their catatonia. Flip, sarcastic, biting, borish, tired, and sedentary. Welcome to real life. Read it if you'd like to get to know us better. Personally, I'd rather set my sights higher. I find us rather pedantic."
1,pretentious postmodern garbage,"This book was horrible. The writing made my skin crawl, not only that it made me disgusted that things like that even get published. I couldn't imagine anything more contrived than the part where they lit the candles and blew them out 'so at least they'd be in a darkness they themselves created' or whatever."
2,a useful pamphlet,"This is more of a large pamphlet than a book. Some very nice photos, and quite a bit of useful information. But this more local boosterism than real analysis. It's a choppy collection of brief overviews on widely varied topics."
1,The product number was for booster cables but I only got sent the bag...,I ordered this thinking I was getting booster cables with a handy carrying bag but it turns out I was just sent the bag. Would I really fork out $5-10 for a bag? I don't know if it was just the seller I bought from but if your looking for cables MAKE SURE YOUR NOT JUST GETTING A BAG.
2,Drivel,"Being stuck for a week with only the first seven Leduc Investigations books to read (three I had to give up on), I now know literary hell. The main character is a leftist private detective, who dislikes the incompetent and corrupt police (but is the daughter of a senior Prefecture of Police officer), who has a weakness for bad boys, Couture fashion and cigarettes, and is possibly the most annoying character I have read. The author has no clue about criminal investigations, French law enforcement, weapons, or forensics, but besides that...Also the author besides her socialist leaning drivel and improbable plot lines, has the charming ability of making Paris the City of Light, seem as drab, grimy and nearly appealing as Detroit."
3,Murder in Montmartre,I enjoyed the way in which the author incorporated details of Paris in the story. I found the story line re: Corsican rebels rather confusing.
3,"Great doll, not a puppet.","When I saw this online, I got so excited that I ordered it without reading close enough. This is a doll made to look like the puppet from the show. I thought that it was actually a working puppet (considering the price)so I was pretty disappointed when I opened the box to find he was only a plush.That being said, he is an awesome doll and the quality is amazing. They did not cut corners on his body or clothing. He's even wearing socks and his jacket pockets are real.I only gave him a 3 because of my personal issue with him not being a puppet. If I had wanted a basic plush I would have given him a 5 for sure."
5,Angel Puppet Replica,"This is a great item for all Angel fans to have. I'm a brand new fan of the show but the ""Smile Time"" episode in the fifth season has got to be my favorite episode so when I saw they made replicas of the ""Angel-turned puppet"" I had to get it. It comes in a box with a certificate of authenticity. It's also very easy to take out of the packaging and put back in for those who are too anxious to play with it but also want to keep it in it's original packaging."
5,Excellent,"This volume, like its sister volume, ""Letters of Nichiren,"" contains superb explanations, background and excellent translations of some of Nichiren's most important writings. It will appeal to all Soka Gakkai members as well as anyone interested in Nichiren. Excellent."
3,"More invasions, or just more research?","What I would like to see this book (and others) address is the question of whether there are enough actual ""new invasions"" to consider it an ""explosion"" or whether there has simply been lots more studies done in recent years to look in detail at species movement, population expansion, and adaptation. That would be a scientific approach; take a look at Charles Elton's work on the topic, from the 1950's. World War II was the point at which this idea took off -- the Nazis were BIG into purifying their country in more ways than one and wanted to purge all ""non-native"" species. To me, that says a LOT about the mind-set of the folks who espouse a ""native-species-only"" purist attitude."
2,Scott jumps on the prog/trance bandwagon,scott used to be a killer techno/house dj....now from the sound of this cd...he's on the trance bandwagon....ahhh..I think I'm gonna puke....can there be anymore timo mass remixes!!!!!!!.. i'll have to talk to him next time I see him
2,Needs more SQL,"This book has some good things for the beginner, but I think most developers will get past this very quickly and need something more. I was very disappointed with the lack of information/examples on query writing and usage. SQL is a big part of database development in general, and this book barely mentions anything about SQL."
5,The one book you will want if you are writing Access code.,"Whenever I need to write VBA code I reach for this book. The author explains in very simple terms things that are often hard to understand. There were a number of features of Access that I had never used. However, after reading the chapters about such subjects I have been able to write code in applications that use the feature. A plus is that after the concepts are explained in the chapter, the author then applies them to a Time and Billing application that is developed chapter by chapter."
2,I found the book to be a dissappointment.,"It is quite clear that the author knows what she is talking about, but trying to use the book is another matter. The examples are all without context. The CD rom is a joke; what I need is a working database with all the bells and whistles and a book that explains how it works and how to convert the facets of the database to my particular situation. Prauge & Irwin's Access for Windows 95 Bible does this. I have not read the 97 version."
5,Become a true professional,"I found this book to be an excellent reference. It has helped me develop my skills from an intermediate standard to that of expert. The book begins by providing its audience with an overview of the basics of Access and then unfolds to unleash Access, VBA and SQL techniques, methods and coding that will make ones development work look professional.It is an outstanding source of reference for everyday usage and is vital for those who wish to become Microsoft Certified in Access Development.The book caters for all audiences; the IT trainer to the Database developer."
1,What a ripoff,Warning.... do not buy this CD....the quality is low and sounds like it was recorded thru a handheld recorder. The remixes are an absolute joke. You can do much better with the 1968 Filmore West release. Amazon....you should be ashamed of yourself for even presenting this CD on your website. Refunds should be offered to all purchasers(myself being one)!!!
3,"It's good, of course, but it's not Supernatural...","Mystical Spirits is essentially a summary of Santana. It has a sampling of his famous themes and solos, live performances, and some remixes. This is why it isn't being spoke of like Supernatural, because it isn't Supernatural. There's really nothing new for the Santana-lover, and it's not really like the stuff on Supernatural. This music is good, of course, but the concept of this collection isn't. Someone who is fond of the guy probably already has these songs, and someone who only liked the Supernatural album probably isn't a real fan of his style. SO, to recap: If you're buying this because you liked Supernatural, don't bother, save your money. If you REALLY like Santana, not just the change of pace he took in Supernatural, then you're probably going to purchase this album and be mildly satisfied like myself, even if you already have the songs in other albums."
1,abysmal sound quality,"I looked forward to listening to the live disk in this 2 CD set, but when I put it on I thought I was being put on... or maybe there was something wrong with my stereo. Nope. It's just an atrociously poor recording, like a bad bootleg, and it isn't even in stereo. Why on earth would Santana release such a poor quality recording without at least noting somewhere on the packaging that it's not professional quality? With the success Santana is currently enjoying, I wouldn't have expected such a dirty trick! Very disappointing."
2,Santana Record Deals,"Santana only had 3 recorddeals; Columbia, Polydor and Arista. Cds which are not on one of these 3 labels are bootlegs. This version of the ""original recordings"" is no. 23 or 24 , I lost count. For die-hards is nice to have one of these recordings. People who only have Supernatural should buy Milagro, Lotus, Caravanserai or the first 3 albums. Don't buy this cd (or the other 23 or 24 versions)if you're not a die-hard."
4,great underappreciated movie,"great movie. i was actually trying to track this down on DVD (i don't think it exist) but amazon sent this instead. i eventually happened to be visiting a house with a VHS player and was able to watch the movie again, and still really enjoyed it."
4,A Cult Classic - Only VHS,"I never saw these actors before and have no idea who they are or what they are doing now, but this is a piece of work you will either really enjoy or hate. The odd thing is that it reminds me of some of the people I knew in school. They weren't grave robbers, but some of them could have acted in this movie without much effort. The acting is first rate for a semi-gruesome flick."
5,AWESOME!!!!,"i REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. I ALSO CAUGHT THIS MOVIE YEARS AGO ON HBO. AND YOU KNOW, A FEW YEARS AFTER A VEEEERRY SIMILAR MOVIE CAME OUT. ""O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU"""
1,Terrible experience,You shipped the wrong product to me (2 times). Your description of the product was completely different than what you shipped. Ultimately I had to return both products and order the product through Walmart. Walmart shipped the right product in less than 4 days.
5,"Wonderfully peaceful, meditative franco-senegalese fusion","I was lucky enough to visit the monks of Keur Moussa Abbey in Senegal in the early 1980s. Coming from 18 months living in the devoutly muslim far northern part of the country, it was quite surreal to wander around the grounds of the abbey and listen to the christian liturgical kora music coming from this group of african and european monks. A wonderful compliment to your Baaba Maal and Yousou NDour CDs!"
3,"Solitons, Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Inverse Scatteri",It's very readable book and very important to every one who want to study more depthly about soliton theory via inverse scattering transform methods
4,"Not a good intro, but good nonetheless","I agree with the previous reviewer that this is not the set to get if you're looking for an intro to goth music. A lot of the bands are obscure, and a lot of the tunes from the ""famous"" bands are not their most popular. However, if you're looking for a collection of songs to widen your horizons and to provide a complement to your goth music collection, I think this is a good buy. The inclusion of the classical ""theme from Dracula"" is particularly inspiring."
3,Some great early cuts and some misses,"The bauhaus song in the intro cd is good but much of the rest except for Iggy Pop, and a few others I did not go for much. The best song I liked was one with no singing at all with a real good riff and sharp echoed guitar sound but it was only a minute or so. You will find one of Marilyn Manson's knock off songs in here with a women group singing that is memorable to me. There is also a Vanilla Fudge redo in here that is ok-- some velvet morning when I'm... with a merry go round kind of twist in it. I think they could have combined albums cause I really only listened to a maximum of 3 to 5 songs on each album."
2,Best thing about this comp is the cover,"If you're looking for a proper introduction to goth music check out the Gothic Rock compilations from Cleopatra records first. This is probably not worth anything to anyone but a die hard collector. It's full of poor representations of the more popular bands featured (with the exception of the Mission's Daddy's Going To Heaven Now, which is just wonderful), and about 20% of the bands on here aren't even true goth bands!! Since when is Iggy & The Stooges a goth band?! There are way too many upbeat pop and punk bands on here as well. But then, there is something worth while here afterall. There a few ultra obscure early goth bands featured who's music is next to impossible to find anymore. Into A Circle, Actified, and Rubicon to name a few..."
2,Very Poor Compilation,"In my opinion, this was a very poor selection of goth music. It sounds more like a collection of obscure (and deservedly so) B-sides, than something that is supposed to represent goth music of the 80's. Where are the Cure, Joy Division, Tuxedomoon, and others, and are these really the best songs by the Bauhaus, Mission, Gene Loves Jezebel and some other groups included with very uninteresting songs. I almost regret buying this CD."
3,Explicit photos from the past.,The book was interesting to look at. Unfortunitaly once you look at a few hardcore photos the rest get to be boring fast.Interesting from a historical perspective. Unfortunitaly once you see pretty much the same photos over and over again it can get a little dull.I'll give it a straight down the middle 3 star rating. Interesting in an average vein.
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!! (No kidding),"I'm a BIG fan of Poison. I bought this hoping that a well done tribute to a band I've enjoyed for so many years. Well.. If that's what you'd expect too, this is NOT what you're looking for!Firstly, the songs are (for the most part) very twisted, poorly done ""interpretations"" with in many cases only the words being the only thing you can recognize from the original. The music (is THIS music?) is awful. Doesn't come close in any sense of the word.I can't believe Bret Michaels was in charge of this disaster. (Isn't a tribute supposed to originate outside of the band?) I dunno, call me nutty..To give you an idea how horrible this is, the best thing on it is slightly comedic cover of Unskinny Bop by Pauly Shore. When Pauly Shore at his worst is the best thing going, you KNOW you're in trouble :)The only purpose this CD serves for me is to make me appreciate Poison's original releases even more. Don't buy it, you'll regret it."
4,Works Great But a Little Dim,"Overall, this is a great product. It works just as described and will mount on the wall or sit on top of a chest or cabinet. I would have given it five stars, but the light it provides is a little dim. It provides enough light to get around in a small room, but don't let the fact that it has two lights fool you. The light won't reach into other rooms or far corners. Also, be prepared to wait a while to get it. It took the vendor a couple of weeks to ship it."
4,Great low cost lighting,"I've had one for over 5 years, I had to replace the battery once after 3 years. The wall wart finally died, so I'm getting another one. Lights are good enough to light my living room and around the corner for the bathroom. I keep it with only the front room light on, stays bright enough to get around for well over an hour, only use the second light when bathroom is needed. Both lamps on lasts about 45 minutes. Charge cord is nice and long so you can mount for the best placement."
2,Long time for delivery,Book arrived in good condition....had to contact seller to find out when it was going to be shipped
1,Need the pieces!,"I got this book and the other modelers book, and they say you can make this figures using the ""pieces you already have."" I'd like to know WHERE I was supposed to get some of these pieces. One of the crucial pieces that seems to be in almost every figure is one I tried to find in vain... I don't have every odd set with funky pieces that lego has put out, but I do have quite a few. I could not find several of the pieces used in these models..."
4,Fun book!,"I bought this book for my 8 year old son. He has tons of Legos but has difficulty coming up with new creations. This book gave him lots of new things to build. It is easy to read and understand. The only down side of this book is that some of the patterns require some very obscure pieces that we don't have. Luckily we have a Lego store not far, so we're off today to see if we can find some of the pieces."
1,He-Man Season 1,"Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience with this set. Disc 1 would not play on either my Blu-Ray or DVD player. I looked at the discs and they were all very scratched up. It doesn't help that Mill Creek puts their discs in paper sleeves rather than plastic trays like most companies, thus making them more likely to have scratches. I returned the set and got another, but unfortunately had the same results with disc 1 not playing and plenty of scratches on all the discs. Also, one of the plastic tabs that attempts to hold the paper sleeved DVDs in place was broken. I just returned the replacement set for a refund rather than risk getting another bad set."
5,he-man,"Grandson loves it, my kids grew up with it, looks just like it was when on tv, will buy more of these"
5,great book,"mustang moon was such a good book as soon as i finished it i picked up the next one! once again Terri Farley winds you into a book. this time the phantom is blamed for stealing mares but sam knows its another wild mustang she calls hammer. then her neighbor Linc Slocum offers a $10,000 reward for the phantom and the safe return of his mare. sam relizes then its not just her horses freedom shes fighting for, its his life."
5,Homeschool selections.,It is so great to be able to quickly find and order just the book you need online. Affordable pricing. Thanks.
1,A total waste,"I was shocked that the number one brand for exercise bands would produce such a disappointing ""instruction manual.""Rock-bottom-priced exercise equipment companies do better."
2,doesn't animate,"I first read ""The Flying Change"" about five years ago and enjoyed it. Then I went back to school and got my master's in literature and reread Taylor's book and all my old enthusiasm was gone. This was not Pulitzer material. On the other hand, given the abominable state of today's poetry, maybe it was. I've given this book a ""3"" only because there were a few rhymed pieces in it, which were marginally better than the others, although the subject matter is universally banal throughout."
2,Boring,"There is no passion at all. Too boring music . Where is the energy? Maybe some black metal fans like this, but not me."
3,"Not Their Best,7...","A bit of a side-step, if not backwards to the days when the Greeks offended both visual and aural senses. The representation of the Rotting Christ moniker is depicted through the color artwork, as well as musically. Sakis admits to a conscious re-dressing of last year's more gothic Sleep Of The Angels. Throughout the dozen cuts, guitar and guttural voice are at the fore, with synth riding beneath. The conclusion of 'If It Ends Tomorrow' takes time to develop a legitimate guitar break, while 'My Sacred Path' opens in a swirl of electronic effects and staccato riffs, thankfully a path ventured down again only on 'Fateless'. The non-promotional copies of the disc will include a CD-ROM version of the video for 'After Dark I Feel.'"
3,popcorn ok,"The popcorn is ok, but I've had trouble getting it to pop anywhere near completely in my old microwave."
4,It made me feel old,"The ideas in the book to add Romanticism to yourrelationship and marriage were very enlighteningand entertaining. The main insight I got fromreading this book is how little effort my wife andI put into adding a different level of excitmentand intimacy into our marriage with creative ideasof surprise an newness(is that a word)?I am surprising her tonight with dinner and dancingfor Valentine's day which is the first in theeight years of marriage. Sure flowers show uponce in awhile butg never to the extent of theideas in this book. My wife and I have becomefamiliar and comfortable with our daily routine,which does not mean it isn't great, but thisbook has given me ideas on how to take it toanother level. Hold on to your hat (or skirt)here I go."
5,Romance at its Best!,Ready for Romance is a great way to keep your love life alive with your partner on many levels. Its a book you can read together and actually talk about candidly with your significant other when wanting to spice up your love life and break away from your daily routines. Each story is strait and to the point and gets the readers mind ready to think about how he/she can act a certain way or do a certain gesture to show their special someone how much they actually do care. This book also shows how geography and social status is irrelevant and that all you need is a little creativity and genuine affection. You really get a lot for your money in this book. I thank the authors for putting this out on the market!
1,"My ""hope i forget sooner than later"" experience","All this book did for me was rekindle the emotions of discontent and animosity I held for my teachers while in high school for making us read terrible ""works"" of literature. I found this book utterly repulsive, and served only as a cure for my long lasting bout with insomnia. Had it not been a required reading for an otherwise enlightening class in race relations, I would have surely cast the entire evil package into a raging fire. Although based on an issue which could be spoken on, argued and discussed until one's skin tone reached an ugly shade of blue, Chideya obviously raced through this book and never looked back, thereby leaving the reader to feel the same. The book has no structure, and is thouroughly unreadable."
3,Que Sera?,"The musical ""South Pacific"" has a line, that while out of context, is good for this book. ""Who can explain it, who can tell you why. Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.""While interracial activities are going on the results is anyone's guess. Reading historical documents of the late 19th and early 20th century, Irish,Germans and Italians were not considered part of the majority culture. Now they are.I expect there will be new realities but considering the higher rate of mixed white-hispanic couples than black-white marriages, etc the result may be different than the author expects."
2,Falls Flat,"While the ideas have some merit, nothing is really fresh and interesting. The biggist problem is that the writing is so bland and unfocused that the book could not maintain my interest. My impression is that the author needed more time to develop this. As there are many better alternative books available, I simply cannot recommend this."
2,Boring,"I saw the author during a book signing on television. I saw a young, intelligent, articulate lady who had some very interesting ideas about American culture. I picked up the book to learn more about her and her ideas. Unfortunately, though there is a lot of meat in this book, simply put, I was bored...bored...bored. This is not a subject I take lightly and believe me, I wanted to like this book because I like the author. I have to agree with a lot of the reviewers here. There is a lot of data and no real point. A lousy effort and there are few people more disappointed than me."
5,Excellent product,"I have replaced several of these in recent years in several vehicles usually buying the cheapest I can find on ebay. This one from Dorman was much better quality however and they even supplied the appropriate connectors with it (large pop rivets, etc.). Packaging was excellent! and shipped quickly!"
3,Espresso-so-so!,"This book gives U.S. coffee lovers hundreds of recipes with which to become coffee'd out! I particularly found the section on espresso, as well as Cappuccino, good. In Australia we have always had a strong coffee culture, based largely on the European experience, and therefore most of the recipes here will remain untried by me.The book should interest most American coffee lovers with all those flavour variations for their coffee, and for all other coffee lovers, this book will be fun to own as a keepsake and curio on coffee."
5,VERY PLEASED,"Bought several items in this order. They all did not ship at the same time, but they were all received in a very timely manner. I still rate Amazon and their 3rd party marketers as the BEST of any of the many online and shopping networks from which I have made purchased via computer."
4,Wonderful beginner book for coffee lovers,"This book has every catigory of coffee beverage and is great for the beginner, or as a gift for the friend who just bought there first cappuccino/expresso machine. I found lots of interesting drinks to try, hot and cold as well as lists and ideas for flavors to go with the drinks. I brought it home and read it, then tried several items all that same night."
2,A Far Shot From the Book,"It's hard to believe that Disney could miss the mark as much as they did on this one. Even with the great cast. The book, 'The Black Arrow' is fantastic and I recomend it for fantasy, adventure and English history (War of the Roses) readers.What disney did with the story is uncomprehensible and is the reason, I'm sure, that this movie by such a big studio is of such little reknown.My suggestion is to pass on this movie and read the book! This is especially true if you have read the book already...just read it again. You aren't missing anything and you'll only be disappointed.Best wishes and better adventures,KC"
1,This collector's book is a $20 drink coaster.,"I've collected rosary beads for years; it is the most commonly asked-for religious collectible in antique stores, as well as holy water fonts & bottles, religious medals/jewelry & church interior items--none of which are properly addressed in this travesty of a collector's book."
1,Very disappointing!,"This book contains NO useful information, offers only grainy black & white photos. The information with each photo is nothing more than a description of the color of each item, very little info on the ages of the pieces. Nothing that would help you identify, date or value a piece."
3,baby toy,"purchased this item as a baby gift, fast shipment, nice quality, not given yet, so can't comment on how it would interact with a child. but it was smaller that it looked in the picute. just hope it holds up like all the other reviews says it would. (second time you sent this to me)"
5,Yet Another Edition of Great Booker music,"James Booker is the best New Orleans piano player ever. For some reason it seems to be a little known fact. On top of that, he has a deeply soulful and unique voice. This album is not the best of all Booker albums, but even if I just heard this album I would still defend my opening statement. On this work his virtuosity is evident. Blues Rhapsody is a stark example of how he was able to blend Classical and New Orleans-style piano and create his signature rhythmic and melodic sound, which defined his play. I like this album a lot and classify it as a five star recording. If I were to recommend an alternative, it would be a bootleg I bought in NOLA called Let Them Talk-James Booker Live in Europe, but I've never seen it since. In any case this is just plain good music from a super talented and very much American musician."
4,Not the cowboy but worth a read.,I liked this book. Was a little slow in the beginning. I laughed through it. I even purchased this for my mother...she loves it too.
1,pictureless comic book,"very one dementional. Bitter in tone and repeditive. I thought it lacked insight and didnt even have any spicy content. Too restrained at some points and gushing with spite and hatered for men that just fell hallow too often. Some humor could really do this book justice, however for me this author just fell short.Often overly simple,dealing heavy subject matter. Falls flat"
4,big screen,I wanted a compact compass with a big screen to fit in the glovebox. I like this better than another one I bought earlier. I would buy this one again.
4,"Simple, correct and useful. Kinda bulky though","I used it a couples times when I get lost purposely, just so i can test this baby out. So far, I've been able to get back to my starting point when I get lost like 3 - 4 miles deep into my hike.The only thing that grinds my gears is that it's bulky and the belt clip thing sucks. It won't stay on your belt."
4,Works just fine,I really liked this product... good price and it does what it is suppose to do. I recommend this compass.
2,I cannot recommend this compass.,"I purchased two. One thermometer was broken. Side by side the compasses were off 5 degrees from each other. I tried separating them, changing positions...still the same problem. Cheaply made item for the price."
2,Coghlan's Compass Thermometer,"The compass seems accurate, the thermometer is not. It seems to become mor inaccurate as the temperature increases? It is 5-8 degrees low around 60 degrees."
2,looks and feels cheap,I bought this as a gift for someone who gets lost alot. I almost wish I didn't. It looks and feels really cheap.
3,Compass Thermometer,"I was disappointed that the compass did not come with more instruction on how to use it. I had three people try to figure it out from the instructions with no luck. Also the thermometer did not seem to work. After a few hours, I finally figured out how to use the compass. It might not be practical on the trail, since it must be held completely flat."
3,Quite a disappointment...,"This figure looks awesome when you look at the fig on the box cover. The disappointment comes upon opening the box. The size of the fig is too small for me to fully appreciate it. The painting is top notch and the pose of the figure is really hot but her 'shushing' hand is not aligned with her lips! If you're brave enough, you can customize the fig yourself. I had to modify the fig's hand by removing it from the wrist and gluing it back on just to match the box cover.Customizing tip:To remove the hand, use the boil-and-pop technique.File off any excess porcelain from the hand's stump.Glue the hand back on using a smidgen of slow setting glue so you can still reposition the hand closest to what's shown on the box (ceramic epoxy will do). Enjoy customizing!"
4,These are worth the money,"I've tried to save some cash when I bought bike shorts - I will no longer do that. After considerable shopping and trying on many shorts I purchased Giordana's Silverline bib shorts. They are wonderful. The chamois in these is far more comfortable than my other shorts and my legs felt comfortable even 40 miles into a hard ride (well, as comfortable as one could hope). My only complaint is the suspender straps are a bit snug. If you are standing up, they pull down a little harder than is desired. When I am on my road bike and over the handlebars, I do not notice a problem. Giordana has made some nice shorts. They are recommended by BICYCLING magazine as the best shorts to get under $100.00. They are, without a doubt. I look forward to buying a jersey from the same line by Giordana."
1,save the money for your own vacation!,"Unbelievable. I never thought someone could take such an interesting subject & turn it so awful, but these women did. They went to some of the most interesting places in the world and barely seemed to interact with any locals because they were too busy worrying about their underwear or their hair or whether their butts were too big. The only reason I can figure is that all the pieces were so short (less than 10 pages) that the writers didn't have time to develop anything more interesting. Even writers I usually like, such as Sandra Tsing Loh and Anne Lamott, were dreadful in this book. My disbelief kept me going -- ""this can't really be THIS bad, can it?"" Yes, it can."
3,Cute Travel Stories,"A cute collection of travel stories by women. I thought it would be funnier than it was. Many of these essays are older and published previously.A few of the essays stood out (those by Sandra Tsing Loh, Jennifer Leo, Christine Nielse, Sarah Vowell, Christine Michaud, Alison Wright) and others were soon forgotten or difficult to get through (Anne Lamott, Deborah Chaney, E. Jean Carroll, Michele Peterson, Margo Kaufman).One thing for sure, is that reading these stories makes you want to travel."
2,Hit and Miss,"While a couple of the stories were truly hilarious and well-written, many had the feel of a somewhat humorous email a friend would send after a trip - kind of a had-to-be-there or had-to-know-the-players sense of humor. Some, like the extremely funny excerpt from Ellen Degeneres, were cut short. Overall, it was enjoyable ""car-line"" reading (15 minutes here and there while waiting for the kids), but not overly engrossing."
2,So-so collection...,"These stories are all about women in various traveling situations. I expected more of them to be funny, but hardly any were. Some of them were downright stupid, actually. Quite a few locations were covered, but many of them didn't really give me a good sense of place. I didn't think this was a good book, travel or not."
2,Slow and boring...,"I found this book just okay, nothing to brag about. Out of all the stories I only chuckled on three of them and that's not many when there's 28 total. Most of them were way too short or just didn't make much sense to me. I didn't feel I traveled anywhere reading them and that's the whole reason I read travel books. Not at all what I expected from this book."
2,Just not very funny.,"Was really looking forward to this but although there were some ha ha moments, these short pieces were phoned-in. The talent is not in evidence for these writers. If you want some very funny travel writing, try I Should Have Stayed Home, or some of the fiction works by Tom Robbins. This one is a snoozer.I Should Have Stayed Home: The Worst Trips of Great Writers (Travel Literature Series)"
4,Funny ! Funny !,"I was laughing until tears into the first 12 lines. Yes, true some of the stories are not so funny and I feel some of them really didn't belong. Over all it is a pretty good read."
1,Ellen Degeneres saved it from getting no stars.,Oh boy...where to start. I have a feeling that the editor just emailed her friends and offered them all $100 for excerpts from their backpacking travel blogs. These are nothing more than 'What I did on summer vacation' themes from the 5th grade.
4,Another Must Have for Pet Groomers!,"I found this book to be very full of helpful information. I keep it on hand in the salon and while writing- and refer to it often. While it is lacking in case study photos with the exception of a few in its insert, the amount of information it has makes up for any lack of visual presentation."
4,Excellent Softcore Movie,"I bought ""Model Solution"" two months ago, I must say it is an excellent softcore movie. The girls are very pretty... If you're looking for an interesting plot, well this is not for you, however, if you want to watch a good softcore movie with pretty women, then buy this, you'll love it. Well done Playboy."
5,"A light, sexy, very well done softcore video.","This is one of the Playboy softcore videos that get released by Image every other month or so. These movies are almost always a sure bet for softcore. You're pretty much guaranteed to get a lot of great looking women, and 8 to 10 good sex scenes.However, Model Solution stands out even among all the other movies that Playboy/Image have released. This movie is perfect if you just want to sit back and watch some fun softcore. There's no life or death situation or infidelity drama. Just a light, trivial storyline to hold all the action together.The sex scenes in this video are all very, very good, including an excellent scene with Playboy Playmate Katie Lohman."
1,Boring!!!!!,Who's writing the glowing reviews of this film..?? Is it the director and producer posting them to try and sell DVD's?? I watched it with my girlfriend and we were put to sleep by the bad acting and lame sex scenes.The other reviews made me think this was a softcore masterpiece.....Not!!!!!! Pass on this one.
3,OK,I am Jamaican and I've found that these recipes are quite bland. All of our traditional dishes are included in this book though.
5,Romantic and deep. It will follow you the rest of your life,Just buy and start reading. You can't stop until the laste page
3,Outdated,"This is an old and very outdated work. While books on comparative religions are difficult to come by, this one offers very little insight."
5,funny is its middle name,"Building on the success of tenchi muyo is sena and he pulls it of, don't watch this expecting to see tenchi in every episode but you will see him in 1 episode. hopefully we see more of the tenchi universe like this."
3,Shoe keep falling off,"Good power and construction. Not as smooth as the Milwaukee Super Sawzall or as fine of a speed adjustments. However, the trigger feels better than the Super Sawzall, which is too small and exerts too much pressure on the finger. My main problem is with the shoe adjustment, the lever is too loose, rotates to the open position and the shoe falls out every time I use the Tiger. I need to wrap duct tape around the shoe lever."
2,Ok but not the same,"ok here goes I personly didnt like this album, it isnt ANYTHING like their other two. First of all they changed lead singers, and they went back to their roots as a death metal band. The still sound like power metal music wizes, but their lyrics just went to hell. I'll read a line from the song Hell and back ""nailed to a cross and I spit in disgust no way that I'll follow the blind Broke down the shackles that fettered my mind the devil laughs by my side"" So in other word if you like this kind of music it is one of the best, but if you were like me and thinking to hear the old nocturnal rites STAY AWAY."
2,Not even worth 3 stars,"I've listened to a lot of metal, and the reason I picked up Afterlife as opposed to another NR album on my bi-weekly CD buy is that there was a lot of praise/disdain towards it. In my experience, albums that have a lot for and against them are best figured out by personally listening to instead of going by albums. However, I am thoroughly displeased with Afterlife. Most of the songs ran together and there was little to impress me. It sounded incredibly generic and although I'm not too big a fan of ""8th Sin"", even that is better than this. If you're getting into NR and are wondering what album to buy, I recommend NOT this. It's worse than Elvenking's ""The Scythe"". But if you really are curious, listen to the samples for every track and form your own opinion."
5,different but still good,"I don't agree with the reviews on this cd. I think afterlife is a killer cd. Yes the sound has changed a little, more heavier and less melodic, but thats the way i like it. The cd still has the speed of past releases such as the sacred talisman, which i also think is a killer cd. The singer has changed also, but the change is not that noticable to me. Comparisons could be made to bands such as Forbidden, one of my all time favorite bands, on such songs like 'the sign' and 'hellennium'. While other songs such as 'wake up dead' brought back memories from JP's 'Painkiller' release. The title track is probably one of the best metal songs i have heard in a while (one reviewer called NR a rock band, come on). So if you like power metal, speed and heaviness then this cd is for you. Don't always go by 1 or 2 bad reviews, AFTERLIFE KICKS A**."
1,WHAT IS THIS!!!,"When I first listen to this record I got shocked. This does not sound like the old band at all. It is a real diseapointment. Where is all the good, melodic songs? Where is all the great guitar-riffs? In fact, almost everything have changed. Now they sound like any ordinary hard rock band. The things that made them special are gone. The two records before this one was sooo great, but this one is not worth buying. At least not if you're a fan of the two before. Then you should save your money and buy something else...."
1,Only list IN STOCK items,I do not think ANY SELLER should list an item that is not IN STOCK! You listed it as IN STOCK when I purchased it only to wait for a week and then say it is OUT OF STOCK! Do not buy from a seller who lists items as INSTOCK only to wait a week to notify you they are OUT OF STOCK!
5,Great product! I will buy it again!,It worked perfectly for three years until I broke it two weeks ago. This is the best filter I ever had and will buy it again. You can't go wrong buying this.
2,"Good for protection, bad with lights","The price is good, but I had underestimated the effects of direct light. It produced some significant undesirable effects on the image. So I will just have to be more careful, or not use the filter. It's well built and is certainly up to the task for protecting your lens."
2,Not coated,"I know for sure these are not coated. I actually called to requeste a replacement when I noticed it and they shipped me another one that exactly the same. The pack actually says it is not coated but it seems they are selling it as if it was. These were so cheap I did not want to go the hasle of trying to get them do actually fix this. I was afraid I was going to end up with a large stock of uncoated lens! Actually, if you do not mind having an uncoated filter these are pretty good. They seem solid and I have been using them in some conditions."
5,Superlative; the best book for learning hiragana.,"An unqualified triumph. As someone who struggled to learn the hiragana characters through ""brute force,"" with attendant frustration and slow progress, I was amazed at how easy and effective this book made things. It doesn't coddle you, either--most Japanese books baldly assert ""this is how the characters look, period. No deviation from them is permitted, nor will any ever be encountered."" This is, of course, hogwash--variant forms of the characters run rampant. Heisig's book , however, admits this, and even shows you a handfull of different forms, from block print to flowing script. An excellent, indispensible book. Buy the katakana book, too--also well worth your time!"
2,A Last Resort,"The biggest failing of this book is that the ""alphabetical"" order is treated as an afterthought, sing a song to yourself and you can remember it. In fact this is extremely important and would create a huge problem.I'd suggest at least trying the old fashion approach, learning from a chart of all the characters. Those characters you can't remember or confuse make up your own system."
3,Mixed bag of classics,"A wide variety of songs remixed here. The best remixes are Sweet's ""Fox On The Run,"" The Champs ""Tequila"" and Bill Haley ""Rock Around The Clock."" Astralasia's remix of ""Diaminds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" doesn't hit the mark (a jumled mix of drum and bass) and Chemical Emmission's remix of The Ventures ""Hawaii Five-O"" just plain sucks. The bonus disc is very good."
1,SO MANY YUCKY MOMENTS,"THE SONGS ON HERE ARE SLACK REMIXES...MOST ARE POOR RECORDINGS, NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS BUT REDONE STUFF WITH A DRUM MACHINE PUT OVER THE TOP....AS A WORKING D.J. I FIND THIS STUFF REALLY ANNOYING...ON TRACK SEEMS TO BE A LIVE RECORDING DONE BY LESS THAN ONE MEMBER OF THE ORIGINAL BAND...BE WARNED SOME OF THESE SONGS MAKE DANCERS EXIT THE DANCEFLOOR!!!!!TOM WYNN- A PROFESSIONAL D.J."
5,Don't take it too seriously,"I think some people take books like this a little too seriously - it's meant to be fun, and informative if you approach it with an open mind. I don't think it rips off anything - I think the authors are trying to reach a wide variety of readers. I am Wiccan, and I'm not offended at all by this book. Flip through it, you never know what kind of little gem you might find. You just might become inspired or try some new ideas for self-improvement or awareness."
1,A joke,"This is a joke. I have read a lot of books, but this has to be the worst I have EVER read. Ever. It makes Silver Ravenwolf look like Ronald Hutton. Seriously. It's THAT terrible. This book is an insult to all pagans everywhere. It should be called, ""Christian Self-Help on a Broom"". I just can't express my disgust and contempt for this book. It's so bad, I'm almost speechless.Included are rituals for Ramadan, prayers to St. Francis and numerous other Christian saints. I don't think there isn't a cultural or religious tradition that hasn't been ripped off for use in this book. This is not only disrespectful to pagans, but the religions who this book is ripping off who practice their own cultural traditions, not to mention the gods and spirits of said traditions.For more information on why this is so wrong, and why books like this are evil, look here: http://www.thecrookedheath.com/quick.htm"
1,Lasted less than 6 hours!,"I bought this item for the price and quality of previous Swingline Electric Staplers. I received it sooner than expected and I was elated. I registered it on-line and used it at work, stapling no more than 5 pages at a time. Less than 6 hours of starting to use it, it jammed and I could not un-jam it. I called the 800 number of the MFG and customer service told me that this model was discontinued 4 years ago, if I had known that, I would not have purchased this item. So now I am out the money I spent and I do not have a working stapler!"
3,OKAY FOR SIZE,The electric stapler is okay for the size. It does its job. It also works for what i bought it for. I work at home and needed it to staple a tag description to a bag. I works.
1,Very disappointing--don't buy it!,"If you're expecting something much better than the movie (as books usually are)--forget it! The person that decided that this book would make a good movie must have had an extraodinarily good imagination. The only elements the book seems to have in common with the movie is the title, some of the character names and a very loosely similar story. Where the movie was riveting and moving, the book is boring and bland. Having stills from the movie printed on the cover and in the book, which suggests that the book and the movie are closely related must come very close to false advertising. Don't waste your money!"
3,I found this slightly confussing...,"This book has a great beginning, full of description that will take your breath away, but tends to die off as you get farther into it. I also found the story quite dull. It was okay, but nothing like I thought it would be."
3,Courtney's review of The Whale Rider.,"This movie was not for the weak at heart. It was very sad. It is based on the book written by Witi Ihimaera. About a girl, born a twin, into a family, where being a girl, you were classified as 'lesser' than the boys. Her father named her Pai. Pai's mother and twin brother died during birth, and her father was always away, so Pai was raised by her grandparents, in a small house on the coast of New Zealand. Pai's grandfather was a well brought up man, and he was very disappointed by the death of his grandson, who was to follow in his footsteps, and become a tribal chief. He also believed than women could not be leaders, which is disappointing and unfair for Pai, for she has a great talent, but she shows him, women can do anything as good as the men. It was a good film, very emotional and inspirational. The actors were amazing, especially the young girl who played Pai. I think it is definitely worth seeing if you like movies with a bit of passion."
4,Trying to become chief,"A 1001 CBYMRBYGU.Kahu was born into a world that did not want a female chief. Her great-grandfather, the current chief, like all the others in her tribe, ignores her, despite obvious signs of her chief-ish qualities.From page 64: He (Kingi) used to tell me that his favorite image of Australia was of Joan Sutherland singing ""Advance Australia Fair,"" a can of Foster's in one hand, and surfing into Sydney Harbor like ""an antipodean Statue of Liberty.""Kahu's grandfather: ""Our Koro was like an old whale stranded in an alien present, but that was how it was supposed to be, because he also had his role in the pattern of things, in the tides of the future.""I loved the way Kahu pulled the stone from the bottom of the water, the dolphins that swam around her, the whales beaching themselves, and the appearance of the tattooed whale."
5,Wonderfully uplifting for girls!,I love how this books shows the transformation of an old fashioned grandfather to one that is loving and supportive and willing to learn from his granddaughter. After you read the book you need to watch the movie - beautiful images and great visual interpretation of the story!
3,beautiful story,"Very beautiful moving story. I'm sorry that I saw the movie before reading the novel, as I would of appreciated it much more by just reading. The movie maybe cheapens the book and the sytle in which it is written. Overall a great book that I will keep on my shelf for a lifetime."
5,A great read-even the fourth time around.,"This is one of the best, most magnificently written books I have ever read. I actually broke my usual rule and saw the movie first. It is now my favorite movie. In no extremely drastic way do the book and the film differ, there are differences, but I've come to appriciate them both as seperate stories. It really is a fascinating read, combining a kind of magical realism and very real discription of issues indiginous groups face around the world. The story fuses spirituality with science."
4,To touch magic,"Told by her uncle Rawiri, ""The Whale Rider"" tells the story of Kahu, a young girl in New Zealand struggling to find her place in her family and community. She craves the love of her great-grandfather, but he's entirely focused on the future of their tribe who don't have an elder male heir to inherit the chief's title. There's only Kahu, and her great-grandfather doesn't see the use of a girl. Kahu is strong and determined, and her destiny as the fabled whale rider is secure due to her ability to communicate with whales, but only if her tribe notice in time. This is a beautiful story about the struggles with tradition, about magic versus reality, about the status of our modern world with its racism and sad ecology."
3,I could use a large print edition,"We are singing out of this book and I am finding it difficult to read some of the type, for example, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel...I wonder if that is a font size 6 or so? And the chorus is in italics, for crying out loud. Yes, the music is lovely, but surely there is no reason not to offer music in larger print. Maybe some of the publishers need to get into the choir lofts all over USA and see how bad the lighting can be, then they will understand.The reason I came to Amazon.com was to buy a large print edition, but apparently it is not offered."
4,Great transaction,"Easy, fast transaction. Product is what I expected. No problems or criticisms. Product was enjoyed by (adult) recipient"
4,Sturdy product,This backpack is great! All the stitching and buckles are good quality. It is definitely meant more for use in snowboarding but I plan to use it for hiking and mt biking. The only draw back I have is the main compartment only has a divider at the bottom. It has the goggle pocket and the media player pocket. Could use more internal or side pockets.
5,Great for fans,"Megaman trading cards great idea for fans allows you to have all the fun of a net battle without having one. The next thing is to make a Toy PET with battlechips. even if that is a toy i would buy it.Great for fans of the show,series,games."
4,PET and the card game!!,Before they made these Nt warrior PET (Personal Terminal) Now they are making New Video games and New PET's. Capcom is on fire! the manafactuarers are really knowing which companys to help with! The card games rock and the PETS rock
3,Good Battery,"SterlingTek's battery replaced the original Sony battery that had lost it's capacity to hold a charge. It worked just like the original. I wasn't able to notice a difference between this ""High mAh"" battery from the regular one but did like the fact that it hasn't shown appreciable memory effect."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,I bought this TV to use during lunch breaks at work and to take to football games. It couldn't pickup any VHF channels and could only pickup the same 2 UHF channels. The next day I shipped it back for a refund.
2,Coby TV350,"The price was reasonable, the screen size is great, the few channels that did come in had a great picture and the sound was great.My only problem is it automatically tuned into channels so my local channels did not all come in. Only the spanish stations came in clearly and I do not understand spanish. It does not have a dial for you to go to channels and that is a big draw back seeing our 20 yr plus old portable tv has that feature and all my local channels come in on that one. This TV would be perfect if they can make one with a dial for channels and not auto tune."
1,Horrible product! Useless. ATI thermometer is the one,"I have perfect vision and not colorblind. However, when I look at this thermometer, I feel like I suffer from both. Basically, it's unusable. The ATI thermometer works well and is visible."
4,Highlight of 'Roadside Geology' Series,"Roadside Geology of Southern British Columbia may be the most detailed and information-dense title in the Roadside Geology series. The two authors carefully describe the province's convoluted geology with clear explanations and engaging references to early settlement by Europeans. The reader learns how this magnificent landscape formed and a lot about geological processes in general. It's a great read, even for someone who never visits British Columbia."
5,Looking at the B.C. Landscape,"For people, especially amateur geologists, or for those with an interest in the landscape they drive by or fly over,this is a superb book to have as a reading companion in many places--stopping by a roadside, viewing the land below from an airplane seat, or on a leisurely trip aboard a train. ""Roadside Geology of British Columbia"" is a ""must have"" when planning a trip on the highways and byways of the province, especially for those people with a continuing interest in learning about our planet."
5,"Sake(my dog) runs with this shoes, couldn`t be better",It feels like confortable e he is able to run with this pair of shoes. I loved them.
2,stylish but not very functional,Used once and the velcro strip on one of the boots already started to seperate. Used twice (in the snow) and our dog lost one of the booties...not any better than cheaper products we've tried before.
3,dog boots,"This is the second type of dog boots that I have purchased for my lab. He can take them off with his mouth. I had read the reviews and they looked good but again, I face the same problems as with the first (a different brand) The velcro strap needs to be hidden somehow so the dog can't get to it. On the ruffwear website it shows a dog hiking in them... I hope my dog becomes less enamored with removing them or I can come up with a way to adapt them. I will see if training him to ""leave it"" works...."
5,HOT!!,These shoes r GORG!!! i got them in coral and green...they r comfortable and beautifully design. Sturdy too...I say get them in every color!!
5,Cockatiel,Bought this for my cockatiel and he loves it! Fits nicely at the top of his cage for easy access to his food. Fits a good amount of food in this feeder.
4,"Brittle, but a decent cup.","When I first purchased this item, I tried to wash all the parts by hand, while the top cover looks like it will come off it won't and I ended up breaking the piece, ruining the item. The screw is made of cheap plastic and will snap off really easily if you use this in a non-standard setting. (ie) I threaded one into the pvc of my bird's gym and when moving the pipe I accidentally snapped the screw off at the base. Overall, I think it is a decent product, if handled delicately"
4,useful,very good item but i have a problem with it its not closing fully like how it shows on the picture for the twist move to remove the water container is this normal or is mine not made right?
1,Received cracked,Well all I can say is that when I went to put the water in it the bottom has a crack and the water drips out. Needed it very bad to keep water clean. There is no use for me to have this product.
5,One of Mr.Tuckets great adventures,This book is about 14-year old Francis Tucket. It is along the Orgen Trail. Once I pit up this book I could not put it down. If you like books by Gary Paulson you'll like this one better! I liked this book because history is great.
5,The Start of a Legend.,"In this triumphant book proves a defintion how the midwest survived the 1800's with the settlers and the Indians. Of the constant cold war between the two groups there are many trades and treaties and a hint of war.In the beginning of this short but exciting book it starts out as a family traveling to Oregon. Their son Francis Tucket gets captured by Indians and is held captive. Though one day a one armed man shows up to the tribe and helps Mr. Tucket ( at least that's what they call him) to escape. This book is about the adventures they have together and the mysteries they explore.Quick read, edge of your seat book, will have you shouting for more."
5,Satisified,Great product.. My grandson is who we got it for. It is a great tool for my oldest grandchild to learn with. Thanks
4,Poor Text Conversion,Conversion from hardcopy to electronic text is very poor. Many incorrectly spelled words that make for tough reading. I enjoyed the book other than the test quality.
3,Not five because Kindle,"I have used this book to excite young readings for years as a fifth grade teacher. My fourth grade daughter wanted a good book to read so I purchased this book on her kindle. My reason for giving it three and not five stars is the price of kindle books!! Why would anyone get the Version of anything when it is the same price as a new book, or the fact I can purchase this book on Amazon.com for $.01 used!!!????!!???!!?? Selling it as a Kindle means publishers do not have to pay for printing, about 15% the cost of a book, and Amazon does not have to lose money shipping it to a prime member, like myself. I hope the justice department gets the publishing companies that fixed prices and hurt the free economy and this great new technology."
4,Mr.Tucket,"Mr. TucketI read a very enjoyable book called Mr. Tucket. Mr. Tucket is about a young boy named Francis Tucket. Francis and his family are headed to Oregon on the Oregon Trail. Francis receives a rifle for his birthday while he is traveling to Oregon and is shooting it at the end of the wagon train when Indians capture him and take him to their camp. Francis is held at the Indian camp for a couple days, when a one-armed man comes to visit the Indians. Will the one-armed man help Francis escape or will he be loyal to the Indians?I really enjoyed this book. I was amazed by how Francis survived in the Indian camp. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure. Mr. Tucket will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end."
4,Indian Attack,"At the beginning of this book Francis Tucket gets captured by Pawnee Indians and thinks that he will never get see his family again. But then Mr. Grimes, a mountain man with one arm comes and helps Francis escape from the Indians. Mr. Grimes taught Francis how to live as a mountain man. I liked this book because it is the most adventurous book that I have read in a long time. I think that author was trying to that if you learn to solve your problems it will help you become a man."
5,Awesome Laptop Case,"Was really unsure about buying this over the Case Logic, but took a chance and so glad that I did. This case is so well made and very sturdy. It surprised me when I compared it to cases I found in local stores that cost a lot more and I think it is a lot better!! I am very happy with the quality and these days you want the most bang for your buck. I have the HP 17"" laptop and it fits easily. The shoulder strap is very comfortable and very thick and easy to use. Can't really say enough about this case. Would definitely recommend it to anyone and would buy again. Hope this helps you in your decision to buy."
5,Great Laptop Case,It Protects my Laptop and does not look cheap. Easy to carry with all my papers and computer. Great computer carring case.
3,Fast wearing wheels,I used this for six months carrying a laptop and some small hand tools. The wheels wore down to where the case actually drags on the ground after six months. I understand that it was not designed for heavy use but the plastic wheels are just crap. I'll use it again once I figure out how to install my inline skate wheels on it.
4,Works for me.,I purchased this just to use twice a week on one night lay overs and it has worked great for me. The only thin I have noticed so far is the handle tends to stick and doesn't want to extend sometimes. It almost has to many pockets. If you were to try to fill them all with something it would probably crush your laptop.
5,"17"" Laptop Case","I had a Targus case previously for a 15"" laptop and was totally pleased with it. This one is equally well constructed and the laptop and basic accessories fit in it just fine. It's not bullet proof, but I don't want the bag to weigh a ton either, so for me it offers the protection and convenience I want."
3,Handle Sucks,"The case is well built except for the extendable handle.....you will have difficulty collapsing it back into the case. Many pockets. Carries both my 17"" laptop and portable printer with all cables, adapters, etc. and it fits into a standard airplane overhead compartment. I would have given it 5 stars if I wasn't having so much trouble with the handle."
3,It is ok for the price,"I don't use it everyday, but for now, I can only say that you can not place in nothing more than 15.5 inch laptop, your basic tools case and some cables in the front. So be very careful with your laptop size not only the screen size, my Toshiba is 15.4"" screen size and I have to be very easy when I insert it inside the compartment."
2,"17"" laptop bag","The bag is generic, and if I had to carry it around all day in the city, I don't know how it could protect something as fragile or as expensive as a laptop. When I purchased my first laptop back in 1998, I got all the accesories that came with it. The bag it came with was excellent, very well made and it was a Dell Inspiron. If my new computer was only 15.6"", it would fit nicely into that bag. Your better off looking locally before you decide on buying a bag, just to see the quality, before buying it anywhere! If Amazon sells the bag you have seen locally, then get it. I love Amazon, but not all the products will fit every need,lol."
5,"Very nice product, lightweight yet very protective.","I had a Targus for my 15"" Dell. This is just as good and protects as well as my first. I wouldn't buy any thing else since I know these work."
3,No Ordinary Girl,"Nice gift set for the fans, but the book is a real mash-up. It's not a bad effort and really what do you expect? However, it feels kind of thrown together. I did not feel that it ever got to the nitty-gritty of her life. It may be called The Journey, but could have been called On the Way. The cd however, is really very good and I would give that 5 stars by itself. Nice to have included the second cd of the long remixes of ""This Time I Know It's For Real"" and ""Dream-A-Lot's Theme"". The first cd is not all the greatest hits, but how could it be? It's a very good representation of her BIG songs and it's generous time so that you feel you are getting a decent bang for your buck, book or not!"
2,Unrealistic portrait of a dark future,"In the future, according to A.E. Van Vogt, super computers will control not just the traffic and crime and factory but will also control humanity. We will be under the eye 24/7.But is it likely that this computer will be self-aware, a living entity who thinks, reasons and acts like we do? No, I didn't think so and that was the most unrealistic portion of the whole book. ""Today I'm running America"" - a typical sentence from the computer who apparently thinks like we do (associately) instead of algorithmically. Lots of rambling and rumblings that do not inspire. I found myself looking around about 1/3 the way through, wishing this could somehow be over."
1,Stay away from HP.,"This printer was a terrible pain to install the first time around but only after tens of hours with HP's ""support"". About 1 year ago the printer's document feeder was scanning with multicolored stripes. The printer was under warranty so had it repaired. Brought it home and went through the same hassle except this time not even ""support"" at HP can figure this out. The scan function will not work from the unit no matter what HP suggests. HP is the most inept company I have ever dealt with. I vow never to purchase another piece of junk from HP. Take this from a household that has an HP desktop, HP laptop and this piece of junk printer. STAY AWAY FROM HP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Bad hardware, didn't make it to the software.","Supposedly the hardware is good but the software is bad, but I didn't even make it to the software installation. I couldn't make it by the ink cartridge installation. The black one installed fine, but the tri-color would not work. I kept getting the error ""remove and check color cartridge"". This was my mother-in-laws printer and she had another new tri-color and it didn't work either. After trying everything, I called the tech support and he rand me through several diagnostic/test routines that print out information about error codes, etc. He came to the conclusion that it was not bad cartridges, but something wrong with the printer interface with the tri-color ink cartridge. ON one of the diagnostic dumps, there was the error ""too many blown resistors"". Anyway, they are shipping another printer, hopefully this one will be better. But then I guess I have this bad software to look forward to."
2,"Great Hardware, Horrible Software","This printer has absolutely the worst software you can imagine. The software installs a ridiculous 600 megs of worthless crap on your machine. The scanner works 1 out of 5 times. Most of the time you get some cryptic error message. There's about five different useless background processes running on your machine at any one time. The prints looked great, but it's obvious that HP is not a software company."
2,Worst printer I have ever owned,"I bought this printer about a year ago - thankfully with an extended warranty which I bought directly from HP. I am now being sent my 5th replacement. I have never had any machine give me so many problems. If you buy this get the warranty if not you will be stuck with a printer that does not feed paper thru, tells you it is out of paper when it is not, does not load/read color toners, etc. By the way when they send a replacement it is refurbished and the replacement I got 2 weeks ago, the 4th one, the scanner lid does not even fully close. If you don;t use it much and have patience you should be fine but for me it has been a terrible experience."
5,HP's Hot,"I was delighted with this purchase. I love the copy feature; with the ability to do legal and A4 size prints. The features are tremendous for the price and the versatility unsurpassed. The quality of the output is tremendous considering that it is an inkjet printer and I have never once had a jammed fax. The fax feeder has been outstanding and problem free. Having a copier, scanner, photo, printer and fax all rolled up in one outstanding wireless machine for a reasonable price is a big feat. So far, so good. I wish that the inks were less expensive; and am looking into alternatives..but aside from that..I am delighted with my purchase. I also have two other laser printers as well; but this wireless inkjet gives them a run for their money.Bentley/2007"
5,hp,Found product easy to install and easy to use. Great product. Just follow directions and every thing is well
4,"Great printer, terrible software...","First of all, it is a great printer. Color inkjet, duplex printing, duplex scanning, flatbed scanner, sheet fed scanner, built-in fax machine, it is a networked printer etc. Unfortunately, the software isn't great at all. Even after the major recent update it is still buggy. But I love the printer. It allows me to slide a 30-page dual-sided document in it, click ""Scan"", and it will do the duplex scan job, save it into a PDF document and will even do the character recognition for me! But let them fix the software!!!"
1,Auto feeder does not work well,"We've had this machine for 2 years, and the automatic feeder started its problems. Whenever we try to use it for muliple-page faxing or copying, sheets would get stuck together. This is very annoying because it is extremely painful to track which pages got faxed/copied or not. This is the most annoying feature and because of it, I'm not recommending it."
2,don't buy this if scanning speed is important,"On the plus side, the machine looks cool. On the down side, the auto doc. feeder is slow and the maching makes an odd screeching sound at the beginning and end of scan or faxing. It may well work fine for one-at-a-time, manual loading scans (I did not try that function) but look elsewhere if you are planning to load 20 pages in the adf and expect to have the results (a) quietly, and (b) anytime in the near future. Good news: The fine folks at Amazon did not quibble about taking it back!"
5,Great Value for the Money,Due to steep discounting the HP 7310 now looks to be a great bargain. HP recently posted an updated software/driver set for Mac OS X and so far I can say the printer has performed flawlessly. For Mac users the new printer U/I is much more intuitive than previous versions and I had no problems with the installation. This is my fifth HP printer and I think it has the best feature set and output of all. I can't address the Windows side of the house other than remark that this printer works well under Virtual PC.
1,Tough to operate,"I want to express my frustration with the HP OfficeJet people. You sould all be fired.I had your office jet 7110, which broke, but was easy to scan and edit and print photos.My 7310 does not scan, edit, rotate or print, or even center the photo.I have no idea who redesigned and ""improved"" this wonderful machine, buthe should be fired and jailed. I am so dissappointed, I can't tell you,why did you make such a great and easy process of scanning, editing andprinting so difficult.Robb Packer"
5,"fast printing, sleek look, A+","I've been an HP fan my whole life.... but this unit takes the cake. It's probably the best unit I've seen. Fast printing, very modern design - very much worth the money.Networkable, 2 sided printing included, legal sized. Worth every penny."
1,Worst Printer I've Ever Owned,"Do not buy this printer unless you want to spend every free moment of your life trying to work through all of this printer's bugs. Bought this printer, connected it locally to my machine and it worked fine for 2 weeks. Then the printer wouldn't print. No indication, no warning. Just stopped working. After getting on the line with HP, they had me install new software (that seemed to make my computer run slower) and it worked again for another 3 weeks. Made the mistake of trying to use the network printing capability and now I can not print either through my primary computer or my network computer. To add insult to injury, HP wants to charge me for a support call. Finally, scanning feature is terrible as I tried to scan some documents and pictures and the feeder consistently jammed on me.Save your money and stay away from this piece of garbage."
2,Sorry I bought this!,"This machine has NEVER worked correctly -- the software doesn't work, and when I called HP they sent me a ""revised software package"" which ALMOST fixed the problems. It seemed to me that they just gave up on getting this machine to work properly. It seemed to go through ink pretty fast (compared to other HP's I've owned) Yes, I enjoyed the double-sided printing, but other than that, the scanning software was much worse than my previous HP machine and the fax never did work. I would NOT recommed this All-in-One!"
1,SERIOUS COMPATIBILITY ISSUES - VISTA,"Officejet 7310 All-in-One is NOT compatible with every Vista software type or every Dell computer. It seems to work fine on computers running XP or on the Sony laptop running Vista Ultimate. It does not work with the new Dell Studio 15 laptop running basic Vista. HP's website patch does not yet fix this driver issue. Buyer beware, this printer is NOT compatible with every computer manufacturer and Vista software on the market. You might spend weeks trying to find the right driver with the companies' technicians and not getting anywhere, despite the advertisement."
2,Great until it screwed up!,"I'd actually give this a 2 1/2 star rating because before it messed up it was a great product. Excellent printing, much better than any other printer I've had. Unfortunately one day for no reason it decided it had a paper jam. No paper was even in it. I checked it over then took it to a repair guy and there's nothing that can be done. HP has been difficult to work with through this whole thing. A two year old printer that cost as much as this one should not just crap out on me. All it is is a sensor error, a sensor should be replaceable for a reasonable price so I can get it fixed locally or even do it myself. This is either going to pollute some third world country if it is garbage or HP is going to refurbish it again (yes, I got it refurbished as a gift) and sell it to someone else for like $350. Who knows how many times this printer has had this issue; how many times it has been resold."
1,WARNING: Stay clear of seller TxDerriere,"This seller tied my up for over a week with false delivery promises. Then, claimed that the item was damaged after if fell off the Fedex truck.I don't believe the item was ever shipped. I asked to the seller to provided the FedEx tracking info to verify thier claims. They couldn't!I finally received a refund, days later. Stay clear of seller TxDerriere. Hopefully they'll soon be banned from doing business via Amazon."
1,Horrible!,Thought it sounded great. Major flaw: will not automatically answer faxes if you have voice mail indicator on your phone!
2,A bad service for Chopin,"Perlemuter is a serious musician, but the point of view that he uses for Chopin,s music (the same that he uses for Ravel) is completely out of style. The tone is not varied and the articulation of the phrases is difficult to be understood. Why he decided to record Chopin,s music?"
4,Removable battery for iPAQ H430,This battery fitted well but occasionally it would shift out of place causing the handset to be reset because it has to be restarted.
3,Tool Force AC6 Air Control Unit,The product arrived on time. It was just as described and shown on the website. The regulator works as expected. One complaint is the documentation that comes with the unit is very brief (just a mechanical drawing) with a bare minimum of installation and operating instructions. It is a low-cost product that is a suitable replacement for a more expensive version.
4,"Not quite OEM style, but close","Installed in a 92 Thunderbird. The antenna mounts in the fender and is easy to install. The cable is a bit short to reach to the stereo. After mounting, the antenna angles forward about 10 degrees, looks a bit off. I simply bent it at the base to make it straight - looks good."
2,buyer beware!!,"My husband and I purchased this truck for our 3 yr.old for christmas and in the beginging it ran great. However, within a month the motor would stop while our son was driving in the middle of our cul-de-sac. Needless to say we thought it needed charging. After charging over night the problem persisted with the same stalling and beeping noise. I finally called the company and they seemed to know exactly what the problem was and sent a replacement part. I'm waiting to see if this fixes the problem for good. My son is already fed up with the stalling and isn't to thriled about riding it anymore."
1,Will not buy safety first products again,"I purchased the dump truck for my son on his third b-day. I was not sure about spending $350.00 on the safety first product vs the Power Wheel brand but my son had to have the dump truck! I wish I would have trusted my instincts, having two children and hundred of toys it has been the worst purchase I have ever made! After riding it for a few months and following all the recharging instructions the low battery would start beeping after riding it for only one minute. I called they told me it was the battery that needed to be replaced so I went and bought a new battery but it continued doing the same thing. They sent me a new cable to connect the battery but that didn't work. After all of this they said they could not help me anymore because the waranty was out of date now! So my son only enjoyed this $350.00 toy for 3 months. Needless to say I only buy Power Wheels now and haven't had a single problem! If you need customer service beware they are very rude."
3,Was Okay,This is written by the guy who wrote the Red Badge of Courage so the stories were somewhat dull I guess
3,O.K. but not great,"There are several different drawings of different creatures but they all seem generic. Lately there isn't a lot of use for drawing creatures for any industry jobs. If you have to draw creatures pick it up, but if your short on cash it's passable."
5,Pick this up,Great book! I'm a fan of the author Christopher Hart and this is one of his best. I'd recommend it for any fan of comics and illustrators who want to enhance their craft. Lots of great tips and chuckles.
3,Great for beginners,This book is great for beginners- it has a lot more final pictures with less step by step. Content is a bit spread too thin as in author has a lot of information packed into a thin book resulting in characters having less drawing guides. I would recommend anyone to read this to get concept of how it can be expected as comic artist.
2,not what I wanted,"the book is nothing more than a few not good photos of stirling engines, most of them can be found in the web, and interviews with people that builds or use stirling engines for some or another reason, nothing to do with design, no usefull plans, or cutaways.The usefull information from this book can be compiled from the web in a few hours."
3,"Cute songs, mostly sound effects","There are a few very cute and catchy songs in this compilation - I love Goofy singing ""Which Witch is Which?"" However most of it consists of eerie sound effects. Great if that's what you want, but a bit disappointing if you expect it all to be songs and music."
5,A ''must have'' book!!!,"A really beautiful book for architects, interior decorators and people who are interested in decoration. Filled with lovely pictures and not too much words. A ''must have'', collectors book. It gives you nice ideas, makes you want to redecorate your home and makes you dream of having such lovely houses. Just get it and you'll really enjoy it! It's worth every cent!!!"
2,"Good concept, but too big!","I got this toy because my older daughter had a ""Wiggly Worm"" with various crinkles and squeaks and such that she loved to cuddle and chew and take everywhere. But this toy is so big that my 1-year old wouldn't play with it. Given the other positive reviews, maybe I'll try again now that my baby is older."
5,my son won't put it down,"This is a great toy for a baby! It has all kinds of interesting things on it. It has a mirror, different textures, and teething rings. My son would laugh every time we squeezed the head because it squeaks. And when it got dirty, I just threw it in the washer on gentle cycle and let it drip dry. It was good as new!"
3,Hoe Hum..,"It's not a bad book the imageries good, the stories somewhat interesting. But something is missing. It's worth buying but you may need both volumes to feel fully satisfied. If you like her artist style it's worth it for the pictures, but there is something lacking in the over all completed product that makes it hard for me to give it a higher rating."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"I hope people don't just give me a negative review because I was not as impressed with this work as everyone else, so please keep that in mind!I was intrigued by the premise of this book but I was not as impressed with the execution.The first two sections dealing w/ vampires and the like were not as strong as the fairy tales towards the back. The drawings of the people were not varied enough for an all black and white comic and the story itself seemed overly dark, mabye trying a bit too hard?The fairy tales are worth a purchase and read. They are a delightful twist and the darkness within them is more true to the way the original fairy tales were written. The best gem is actually the last fairy tale-Cinderella.If you do enjoy dark stories you should certainly give this a read. If you are a lover of comics and something different than you will also find this quite appealing."
4,Review,"This came recommended to me, and I bought it without first reading any of Serena Valentino's other work. I have to say, I was pretty impressed. Spooky little stories, great illustrations, overall a great read! Everyone else I've passed it onto has liked it as well."
3,Interesting story...okay illlustrations,"The front cover was what made me buy the book, but once I got it and started reading it, the story was good but the illustrations were hard to make out. Sometimes all I could guess of what was going on was a couple of think black lines and some text. The story is what you should really buy it for, with the all the darkly funny, twisted fairy tales, but if you're more into the illustrations, it'd be best to look elsewhere."

5,Excellant introduction to Chemistry,"For someone that is just learning about chemistry this book is excellant. It provides a whimiscal and fun overview of chemistry that makes learning chemistry interesting.It also includes highlights of chemistry that illustrate how chemical principles were discovered.And it also illustrates in an interesting manner the applications and importance of chemistry.If you are about to take your first chemistry class or have never had a chemistry class, this book will be a good introduction to chemistry. Or if it has been awhile since you have had chemistry this book may be an interesting review.Note: While interesting reading, this book would be too light to be used as a text book for a class. It makes an interesting supplement."
4,Entertaining review of basic chemistry concepts,"As someone looking for material to supplement high school chemistry textbooks that students may find informative, as well as entertaining, I found this book to be useful. Students were more apt to remember material read in this book, than when they read the material in their textbook. The graphics are well done and it is written with a sense of humor, which I find entertaining and my students did as well.As a note of caution, this book is a good supplement, but I wouldn't replace a regular intro chem book with this... Also, the order material is presented here is probably different than your text so additional explanation / research may be needed to understand."
2,Cartoon guide to chemistry,It is so basic in concepts and the presentation (materials and graphics)is not as good as I thought. It would be useful to show some pages of the book to the customers.
1,review,"I am a high school chemistry teacher. I was totally disapointed with the book to the point of returning. It is factually correct, but lame. The only thing I gleaned from this book was the origin of the word alchemist. I would not by this book. William ""Douey"" Doucette"
2,Stopped working,"Product worked great for the first two weeks, then stopped working. Just threw it in the trash. Won't purchase again."
4,Works fine,"It's hard to give 5 stars to a lightbulb. They all work, and can't really go above the call of duty."
4,brighter light bulb for my flashlight,I installed the bulb and it seems to shine better. I have only used it for a few days now and i don't know how long it will last.
5,this is a perfect lubricant for woman,I have some issue with my health that cause me dryness in my vagina. I was very concern because I am married and imagine no to be able to please your husband is very depressing; so I was looking for a solution online when I found out about this suppositories. I bought it and started using them since then I enjoy my intimacy very well.
1,Works But...,"I was so excited about this because it really did help. But after using them three times I got a urinary tract infection. I had a feeling that would happen because the product is very heavy. I went to the doctor yesterday and got a diagnosis before reporting this. I rarely ever had infections, only a few in my life. Guess it's back to the old drawing board."
1,Burning Pain Gone,I compared your product with Menomoist Supositories and found it to be the answer to my prayers. I am a sad reciepient of a bladder sling made of mesh. Your product has almost completely taken the burning pain away.
3,It's Okay,It works but you need to where a liner because with body heat melting is immediate and somewhat runny.Swoosh!
5,great product,great product and great value. recommend it wholeheartedly.have looked for it in stores and this is the best deal i have found
5,These really do help!,"If you have sever vaginal dryness, these really help. I know many are saying that a whole one is to much, but I do not think so. It really helps with the irratation and discomfort. I also used these with another product for dryness, called yes, the oil based one. I would recommend these to anyone who suffers from vaginal dryness."
4,Slippery,This product works if inserted about 10 minutes before sex. Open the insert covering down the sides to make it easier to open. It's natural but my boyfriend noticed that it felt a little oilier than astro glide. I like it better.
5,So far the best,"I've tried Rephresh, Replens and a variety of other vaginal moisturizers but so far these are the best. With Replens, I feel like it causes odor the next day. These suppositories provide just enough moisture with absolutely no odor."
5,Very Good Product,"After trying several other products for vaginal dryiness with less than satisfactory results, the Key-E Suppositories have proven to be a wonderful help. They are soothing and non-staining or messy. I am very glad to have found Key-E Suppositories and would highly recommend them to other women suffering from the irritation and pain associated with vaginal dryness."
3,Did not arrive in great condition,"I received this item quickly, but inside the box was crushed and looked like it had been opened. The product was sealed tight individually, so I am going to keep it."
1,Messy,"Definitely moisturizes - but it's overkill! Ends up being an oily, uncomfortable mess! I used one suppository, but probably won't use again unless absolutely necessary!"
5,"Wow, What a Difference!","I purchased these because I was desperate (vag dryness issues). I had tried several other products but was not satisfied, either because they were messy to apply or dried out to fast. Read the reviews here and gave them a try...What a world of difference they made! No itching, no burning, no dry out, no drag, smooth sailing. My man and I both love them. I only use 1/2, which should probably be plenty if applied within a 1/2 hr. to one hour of engagement."
2,Shame,"A truly boring book. I don't need bodies strewn about to get interested in a book, but Ernaux utterly shuns narrative and gives us list after list of everything she can remember from the summer she turned twelve. The result is that no one comes alive in this book, not even the auther herself."
4,Good bags,The bags do what they are supposed to and can hold most computer components. Please note: this particular item consists only of 6x10 bags. The image above displaying assorted sizes is slightly misleading.
5,Another Double Barreled Twofer By The King!,"Nice remastering, original cover art, STEREO recordings, and stellar performances make this two album set necessary at any price."
4,Celebrity addresses by the carload.,"Ever want to write to some celebrity and not have an address? Don't know where to look? Guess what - Alan Gottlieb has taken care of the hard part with his book Celebrity addresses.With over 175 pages, covering A to Z you should have no trouble finding the name of the person you are looking for. The book has musicians, political figures, sports personalities and so much more.The book is broken down alphabetically and although it appears to be complete, with the way celebrities move around some of the information may be out of date. You may want to verify before sending the letter.I think this book would be helpful in most cases, however with today's technology it would be better served to create a web site or develop a software program that can be updated on a regular basis."
5,worth the cool,great mask. can come apart easy and is comfertable. offers great protection. and dosent fog up after heavey breathing. also how often do you come across a camo full face mask?... worth all the buck.
5,I Love These,"I got the same googles but at Zephyr Sports, but same price.(note I play airsoft and don't know how hard they are to clean for paintball). But these google are a comfortable fit and you can put a fan in them. Right in/under the visor, Wich the visor is also removable. Plus the price isn't bad ether. The full head protection really makes you fell secure. When I put them on and looked in the mirror I looked like Master Chief. I also love how you can change the camo lens frames to a color you like, you can also change the lens to (I suggest the chrome ones). I would only by JT googles. [...]"
2,You'll want to write a two star review after trying to change the lens for the first time.,"Having full head protection is really not that useful.Pros:Full head protection prevents annoying hits to back of headGood lookingvisor shields from some sunprotects neck pretty well.Safe, never feel like it's going to fall off, especially with chin strap.ConsIt takes an hour to clean or replace the lens if you do not modify the lens. You have to do that basically every time you play. Seriously, an hour!The visor got a hole in it the very first time I played with it.Less visibility than other masks- That's what you should look for in a mask: better visibilityVentilation is adequate.You might want to go for something like a vforce grill or profiler, which are better quality for the money in my opinion."
4,Watch Your Ears,"Bottom of my ear lobe hangs below mask. Got hit with paintball in the mask and vents allowed paint to go right through mask and into my ear canal. Was pulling paint out for 2 days after showers. Very, Very, fog resistant, but not fog-proof."
4,Highly recommended,Very comfortable mask. Fogging was almost no issue during an entire day's worth of play time. The visor is a little cheap feeling but overall I have been pleased with this mask.
1,Offensive and useless,"I found this book to be just plain offensive. Too much ""opinion"" being stated as fact. Didn't enjoy it at all."
3,"Unfortunately, a mixed Sousa bag","While the playing of John Wallace and his ""Collection"" is spirited and expert, the individual selections are marred by wild tempo swings. Appreciation to all concerned for the Sousa rarities here, but this CD plays more like a live outdoor band concert (not a bad thing), with the conductor's own misplaced ideas, rather than a definative Sousa collection. Justified addition only if you have everything else, especially by Fennell."
5,Incredible!,"The book, though it was fairly light, was a wonderful beginning to a trilogy. It had a fairly good plot and also many twists and turns that weren't completely expected."
1,One of McCaffrey's worst..,"I didn't expect any serious work from Anne McCaffrey, but even for light reading this was really too much. The book is on the level for teenagers, and what additionally annoyed me was ""lets build a colony, everybody should have at least two babies, misterious aliens (tha farmers) don't matter, and stupid Catteni and Eosi overlords don't matter either, brave, intelligent, tolerant and compassionate humans will win"". Yuck!"
1,Fiction for dummies,McCaffrey has good ideas but it almost seems as if she is churning these books out in order to make a quick buck and to meet deadlines. This book is so BASIC it's like reading fiction for twelve-year-olds. How long did it take to write? A week?
2,The author has moved to a new planet,"Anne McCaffrey has moved on from Pern and now has a group dropped down (unwilling) on a new planet, Botany. Unfortunately, the book has the characteristics of a book rushed into print by an established author for her publisher. The story starts out well but then goes downhill. The involuntary colonists, dropped down into a hostile environment, magically accomplish things in weeks that would take normal people years. This seems to be another case of an author that has lost all sense of time (perhaps bored with a slow pace and rushing to move on). The story is left unfinished, leading into another book to be written. I read what must have been the first printing of the hard cover edition and the editing, in places, was atrocious. Don't publishers edit for basic grammar anymore?"
1,Don't even bother...,"After reading some of the reviews, I had to add my two cents. Like another reader, I checked out the first three from the library. Like an idiot, I proceeded to read all three. For those of you concerned about editing in the first book, it gets even worse as the series continues. The characterization doesn't even rise to two-dimensional, let alone free-standing, dynamic development. McCaffrey's attempts to use the slang from the ""other"" English-speaking parts of the world are at times insulting, at others hysterically off-base. As for plot, huh? McCaffrey takes a a solid, original idea and turns it into something no self-respecting pulp writer would have used. Finally, McCaffrey's chauvinism, masquerading as Old World British condescension, jarred constantly. Basically, don't even bother...."
5,Excellent Series,"I'll admit, I didn't notice the errors that the previous reviewer was irritated by, perhaps it only happened in the paperback edition? Never-the-less, this was a great read. Though best known for her Dragonriders of Pern series of books, I like Anne's work that is based in a world similar to ours. The Catteni Sequence delivers. What would happen if Earth were invaded, and humanity enslaved? If you enjoyed Independence Day, you'll like this series. I also highly recommend Susan Wright's SLAVE TRADE trilogy (don't be fooled by the provocative title--good for young adults too)."
2,Good idea but bad story,"This story is just like many other books McCaffrey has written. She has a good imagination and interesting ideas, plus some skill in giving detail and imagery. However, her characterization absolutely stinks. Zainal has no real personality, and never once acts like a real person. Kris is supposed to be passed off as a normal college girl, but it's obvious she's not. The storyline is too easy. There is no way you can realistically let loose a bunch of people and get them to be in an orderly society within two weeks. Human nature just isn't that way. They never lose anybody on their trips, and nothing really bad happens that can't be fixed later. Overall, badly written. Could be a good story with serious revision."
1,I like a good McCaffrey book. This ain't good McCaffrey.,"This is another expanded short story from GET OFF THE UNICORN. This time, it's ""The Thorns of Barevi"", which Ms. McCaffrey called ""...an attempt to cash in on the lucrative market for soft- and hard-core pornography in the '60s."" Need I say more? This expansion into a trilogy stretches a thin story past the breaking point. The unreal speed of technological development was especially irritating (left on the planet with axes, knives, and blankets, less than two months later they're rebuilding circuit boards to put a cell phone net up? Not likely!) McCaffrey has never been a technology-driven author, but this is ridiculous! Her anti-military prejudice shows throughout, and the social dynamics in the group can charitably be called unlikely (who really thinks Aarens wouldn't have suffered a fatal ""accident"" shortly after being rescued?) The remaining books in the trilogy go downhill from here. Overall, leave this series alone."
1,Interesting concept done better elsewhere: ghastly book,"(for an infinitely better read on a similar theme, try ""The Earth Abides"")Anne McCaffrey can write(see her Dragon series), but she doesn't demonstrate her talents here. Most of this poorly thought out and illogical book is written in an embarrassingly inept attempt at a smartassed American dialect. Her grasp of American idiom is poor at best and is so gratingly ""off"" it spoils whatever moment McCaffrey is trying to construct. It's like listening to very loud, very acid rock played on a very bad transistor. Characters are shallow and badly constructed. Plot is random, heading apparently nowhere, and the book is a patent first installment in a series...perish the thought! Shame on McCaffrey and her editors for this pulpy piece of trash, particularly as her readership has every reason to expect a higher quality work. This book makes a case for book burning as a form of public service."
2,Sci Fi- the Bland way.,"As I enjoyed her Dragonrider series, I decided to try out the ""Freedom"" series. I borrowed all three books from the local library and gave them a whirl.Now, this book is seemingly more fantasy than reality. Every problem the people have is solved so simply, so quickly, and so easily I began to wonder if there was going to be any conflict at all. I was wrong. Even the things that appeared to be conflicts were, when faced, solved just as easily. Besides all this, the characters are incredibly flat. Kris is the only one with real personality, and even she seems like an idealized version of the author.Basically, don't bother with this book unless you have a lot of time on your hands, or just have to read every Anne McCaffrey book you can find."
2,Everything you'd expect from mass market sci-fi.,"This book is pure sleep-walk. I kept hoping, wanting to embark on a heroes journey, but never got there. Nothing can match the hollow feeling you get when you're finally done. To call it shamelessly open-ended is an understatement. If an unknown author put forth such a plot-less, pointless novel, it never would have been published.Nothing binds this story together -- there is no premise, there is no fulfillment. Characters wander in and out for no reason. They possess melodramatic qualities (i.e. the sexual harrasser - how 90's). It's the worst bit of dramatic writing from someone who should know better that I can remember. And, it's the most shameless, cynical attempt to sell a sequel I've ever seen"
4,Freedoms Landing,A wonderful start to a good series. What you like is your own personal choice and how you like stories to play out in your head.So as for me I liked this book. If you just want a fun read of Earthly destruction and humans being put into slavery. Have fun! I am.
5,For his collection,He asked for it and he is reading it and it will go in his collection of Sci fi so ---- enough said.
3,I Hate Saying This,"I can't stand it man, I love the Teen Idols, but I just have to say, this ain't as hot as thier first cd, in fact it kinda sucks in a way. First off let me say there is a certain lack of energy on this cd, it just doesn't have the power (the powah!) of sweet energy, it's slower! So much slower than thier last cd! I gotta say, I love the first song, in fact I'd be so bold as to say the first song on this piece is the best Teen Idol's song I'd ever heared, in my life. That you must understand in order to understand this review. Cause I am so well pleased with the first song, the rest of the songs are slower and Heather doesn't sing as much... buzz kill!"
4,This CD Rocks!!,"By far their best effort from track 1, the extremely catchy ""Midnight Picture Show"" to the sing along chorus of track 14, ""The Team,"" this CD will not disappoint any fan of fast, catchy Ramones and oldies influenced pop punk. I was not a fan of ""Pucker-up"" I actually thought that CD was the beginning of the end for this band, but it proved to be a simple case of ""Sophmore Slump,"" which seems to affect about 70 percent of all musicians/bands. However this Cd is probably one of the best releases of 2000 of any genre!! Buy it now!!"
3,catchy but not addicting,"when i got pucker up, i really really liked it and repeatedly continued to listen to this and i still do. but this one just lacks something musically and lyrically that i can't really put my finger on. it's, like, less in your face. i guess you could put it that way, but it's still decent and recommended for any teen idols fan."
3,Lots of Vintage Photos,"At first glance, this book looks as if it mainly features exciting shots from the last 20 or 30 years, but they aren't kidding when they say 'century' under the cover photo. Most of the book is vintage shots mixed in with a few pics as recent as the 2000-2001 season (Ray Bourque raising the Cup isn't included, though). This book has some great saves, great shots, and some emotion, but what's missing are the fights. There isn't one fight pic in the whole book, and everybody knows the NHL has seen some fantastic brawls. With exception to introductory pieces by Gary Bettman and the Howes; there also aren't any essays or related news articles to go with the pictures. Younger fans who aren't familiar with the context that surrounds the pics may find themselves a bit lost, but older fans would probably enjoy this book. It would also make a neat companion book to 'A Day in the Life of the National Hockey League.'"
3,Great set but small,This is a nice set indeed but they are deffinetly on the small side and four would be better then three.
2,*YAWN*,"Desert Punk Enter The Desert never had a chance. It felt like they tried TOO hard. The characters are interesting, the music is good, the plots on the other hand felt old, mostly about money, and the setting is too Post-World War Three 1980s movie for my taste. You know, the ones they made with little money, rusty cars and actors nobody knew. In other words they mixed some good stuff with worn out ideas anybody could copy from older animes. Put it all together and you get episodes with nothing to really dig you're teeth into. It felt like a vague remake of earlier animes - like I had seen it all before.Interesting extras but that failed to save it."
5,Soaring high!,"My son fell in love with ""Bee Safe"" at 3 months of age, leading me to track down the other 3 of the series though they are currently out of print. He adores all 4 ""Bee Attitudes"" books, smiling upon turning each colourful page. The illustrations are vibrant and sweet, this particular book having a kite theme. ""Bee Smart and ask questions (talking with a kite flyer), Bee Smart and well-read (at the library reading books about kites and kite flying), Bee Smart with your money (counting coins in a piggy bank), Bee Smart think ahead (saving up for a kite) , Never stop learning or thinking things through (following instructions to assemble his kite kit), And you will Bee Smart - whatever you do! (successfully flying his big red kite) We love this book! If you work towards your goals you will achieve."
5,Awesome case!,I got this case to hold onto my Nikon D5100 and lenses. I'm able to hold everything inside it that I need to--albeit a little snugly--but I would rather everything be difficult to remove than easy to fall out. I highly recommend this cae to anyone who needs plenty of room to carry their equipment.
4,"Good quality, a bit small","Well, I knew it is not a huge bag. It takes my small DSLR (D3100) with the kit lens mounted and another big lens inside, also plenty of room for small flash, battery, charger and a full load of accessories. It is good quality made sturdy and the strap is comfortable. The only big con is that when the bag is loaded it curves being carried on the shoulder and the sides of the top cover rise making it not perfectly water sealed, be careful."
5,Nikon Gaget Bag,"Nice Bag! I was able to fit my new Nikon D7000 camera with lens + 70-300 zoom lens + charger an extra battery without difficulty. The product was shipped ""on time"" ... professionally packaged!"
5,Camera bag,"This bag works great! I have a Nikon D50 with three lenses (18-55mm, 55-200mm and 70-300mm), battery charger with an extra battery, Nikon SS-400 strobe, patch cords, and several misc. items. Everything fits nicely with room to spare. A great buy for the money!"
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For!,"The perfect camera bag for my Nikon D3100. Comfortably fits a camera with lens attached, 2 more lenses and enough pockets and slots for other items including filters. There is also enough room left on the inside to hold an extra flash if I had one.The top is a molded lid instead of just a flimsy top. The adds a benefit to the protectiveness of this case. My tripod will easily fit in the straps which close the case.There is nothing cheap about this case and is perfect for anyone having photography as a hobby and/or beginning photographers."
3,Good- Not Great,"I think this bag is good for anyone who has minimal equipment & accessories/gadgets!I have a lot of cleaning supplies, filters etc. & even though it has a compartment for them it would bulge a lot and didn't want to zip up right with the supplies in it.Had to buy a new bag pretty quickly after I got this one :/"
3,its good but not the best.,"well...overall the bag is quite good in terms of being very sturdy n has space enough for most of your cam requirements but a non backpack types makes a big minus here. being heavy when loaded, its quite a heavy thing on one shoulder or as carrying through the hand held loop. i find it tiring how so ever i carry it. after using this product i do think strongly that a backpack kinda carriage would still make a better choice."
3,Nikon 5874 Digital SLR Camera Case,"First, I would like to say that Nikon makes durable, accomodating Gadget bags. I have used 4-5 down through the past 20 or so years and I have never had any product failures. In the case of this most recent purchase, I found the case to be too small to accomodate all my gear. The pictures shown in the ad give one the impression of more space and compartments to work with. Sadly this isn't the case and I barely have room for my D7000 with 18-105 on body and the SB900 has to take a very unnatural position in one of the lens compartments. I should have done better research. So, ultimately the blame falls on my shoulder."
4,nice bag for good price!,It is very cooshy and has enough room for all my stuff when going on small trips. plus the Nikon liner is awesome
4,Nice Bag,"Very good bag, just a little larger than I had hoped for. I should have requested deminsions before I ordered."
5,Very happy with camera case,It was a gift and the receiver was quite happy with it. It came in the time it was supposed to.
5,very spacious bag at a very low price,after investing on my first DSLR now it was time to protect the investment. I just picked this bag since it offered all I need it for my lenses and other accessories that I always carry with the camera.highly recommend this bag.
4,"Come for the Mystery, Stay for the History","Robert J. Begiebing's The Strange Death of Mistress Coffin is ostensibly a murder mystery but that is not the true delight of the story. The basic story is that of the investigation of the murder of a young woman found naked in a river in 1648 New England by Richard Browne. Onto this basic mystery-thriller narrative is attached the tale of Puritan New Englanders living and surviving in an hostile territory with all their beliefs and superstitions tested, preserved and adapted. The characters are vivid and the writing is both moody and evocative. It was a joy to read and it does truly transport the reader to a different time. It is also a pleasure that the author never resorts to black and white portrayals. Everything and everyone is vividly complex. The mystery, whodunit, element per se is not the strongest element in the book but it is an effective hook to initially capture the reader and take her into this fascinating world."
2,Not much of a mystery,"The premise of this short novel, a mysterious and brutal death, is intriguing, as is its setting. The writing is intelligent and the main character, Richard Browne, is well explored. His uncertainty and mis-steps are particularly appealing. Most of the detail regarding life in 17th century New England is accurate. Once the plot line is laid out, however, the story never goes anywhere else, sinking into 100 pages of dialogue and inner monologue. The solution to the mystery is provided halfway through, and there is no sense of climax or resolution. A pity that a book with such a promising beginning ends on such a flat note."
2,Average.,"I don't recommend this book. The plot of this book is engaging and it does unfold nicely, which kept me reading, but there were other elements that make it unbearable. The writing was stiff and plodding at times. You know the educated men are educated because they speak Latin. The author goes out of his way to explain some customs and behaviors of the time but ignores others altogether, which sometimes makes it laughable. There were kitchens in the 1600s? There's a journal written as if it the writer watched the events unfold on TV. And the rape/murder scene at the end was so morbidly horrific that I got out of bed and threw the book away. I didn't read the last chapter."
1,They may never answer you!,"I sent KINGSTON BRASS, a three sentence email, asking them for a replacement part number on June 16, 2011 for this faucet, that I had recently purchased from AMAZON. I wanted the part as a spare. The original email was resent on June 26, 2011. As of July 2, 2011, there has been no reply. I was going to purchase three other units but without customer service, I will look for another product."
1,Waste of money!!,"I had this installed professionally a year ago. 2 of the handles which kept getting loose stripped themselves so will no longer connect. Then to make matters worse, when the middle knob is set to shower about 25% of the water still comes out the tub spout. I will NEVER buy another Kingston brass product again."
2,finish has come off!,"when I received this it was just what I wanted but it has since had the oil rubbed bronze finsh come off of the handles, still works fine but I think that they just used the polished bras and coated it with the oil rubbed bronze finish."
1,flimsy tarnished ring.,"I was not impressed. But, for the price, you can't beat it. However, if you DO beat it, it will most likely break on impact, due to the thin layer of metal this wring is made of."
4,Good Product,"I needed a ringfast----It came on time, it looks real good, what more could you ask for????"
2,Vandals guide to swapping real fans for radio fans,"Radio = $, so hey good for them. But guess what, the radio is free [shhhh] nobody one tell the vandals that or they might go "" arrggghhh! we cashed in our real fans, the ones that go to shows and actually fork over money for albums, for fans that download 1 mp3 they heard on the radio ...!!!!!!""??Its got me how nitro can be so successful with Dexter at the wheel, he can't pick a bad move, and he sure as heck fire can't cover AFI. Vandals gotta get back to kung-fu, and get that glass half full again!..."
1,This is NOT a good way to learn COBOL.,"Don't buy it! This is not a book. It has all the material on two disketts. It is very tedious navigating from and to various parts of the ""course"". It is very difficult to locate the main menu and it lacks a print option. Teach Yourself COBOL in 21 Days by Mo Budlong is a far better buy."
3,No code CD attached to the Book,I couldn't find source code for this book on publisher's web site. That mean to test those code I have to type all code myself. If I had know it I wouldn't buy this book. I thought this is commone scense for reader to expect the code is either come with an attached CD or can be downloaded.
4,Line by Line,"Line by Line: How to Improve Your Own Writing is a classic, and with good reason. If you like words like ""gerund"" and ""prepositional phrase,"" Line by Line has a lot to offer. Specific instructions on how to tell if a sentence is wordy, for instance, even if you don't have an ""ear"" for it, include such factors as the ratio of nouns to active verbs, and how many prepositional phrases are used.Examples throughout the book soften, but do not eliminate, the academic style. If you prefer something in plain English, read the excellent Woe Is I, by Patricia T. O'Conner. If you want a serious study-guide for improving your writing, Line by Line is a great choice."
1,Author could have followed her own advise.,"The long sentences and choppy -yes, I used choppy!- examples in this book are hard to understand. The examples the author offers as ""fixes"" to wrong sentence structure are hardly fixes. I finished the book out of principle, but after page 30 I hardly paid any attention to the content. reading ""Line by Line:..."" was painfully confusing. My advise? buy ""Grammatically Correct"" by Anne Stilman. Unlike Ms. Kehrwald Cook, Ms. Stilman does follow her own advise in writing."
4,Comprehensive - not compelling,"If you're fuzzy on the finer points of grammar, as so many of us seem to be, this book takes you by the hand and teaches you from the ground up. However, grammar doesn't make for a fascinating read. I've been working my way through this book for a few months. In short - a book every writer should read, just not expect to enjoy."
2,Not off to a good start ...,"Let's see, I'm going to consult as a writing authority a book that advertizes itself on its front cover as ""The one book that shows you how to make what you say as good as what you mean""?One more construction like that and I'm going to ask for my money back."
3,tower heist,"Tale in 1907 pre-Word War I about a former military guy (Gaudeans) who works as illusionist Captain Wunder at a carnaval. He is invited to steal jewels in Ireland. He has to first prove he can do it. Upon completing the task he requests a gal as a helper.They journey to Ireland where he sets up a stool pigeon to get himself into the facility and then procedes to procure the boxes from the safe (he is told not to open them) without a single problem.He and the gal make their way back to Germany. The boxes do not contain what they are supposed to so they think Gaudeans has them. He eventually convinces them that he does not.They let him go then follow him to see if he does have them. Has some interesting moments, I would recomendThe Great Train RobberyandSex on the Moonas better reads in this subject."
4,good basic reference,"This book, though quite dated, is always one I've regretted lending out ('cause I never got it back). As a young sysadmin it was a godsend to me. These days I wish I had a chance to reread the advanced topics which I didn't understand at the time."
4,Great Picture Great Versatility Average Sound,"I replaced an older Sony rear projector to get HD. Everything is similar, and up to Sony standards. The picture is great, and the set is capable of 8 inputs. I can't talk about tuner performance, because I'm running directly from a DirecTv HD receiver via HDMI. The sound is not very good, however. If you are serious about listening quality, you should hook this set up to an audio system. Originally, I wanted a flat screen, but this is soooo much less expensive. If you can stand a set that is about 17"" deep, this is a great choice - and the price keeps coming down - and Amazon ships for free!"
1,Total Rip-Off,"I could not BELIEVE I paid this much money for this CD when I got it. There is a reason there are no samples of the tracks or even any tracks at all listed here. I originally looked up ""Noein Soundtrack"" and this product came up, so I ordered it, and did not realize until it came that it is NOT the soundtrack, it has FOUR SONGS on it. Period. Apparently they are the songs sung only by solua and their instrumental versions and that's it.Total waste of money for the worst songs of the soundtrack. I was primarily interested in the instrumental pieces throughout the episodes, what you get here are the opening/closing and their instrumental versions. That's it.Even if you knew this disc had only songs by solua and only wanted to hear her music, this would STILL be a complete ripoff, considering it's nearly $30 for FOUR songs.This is absolutely ridiculous."
2,Wildly inconsistent.,"I realize that Maltin's only human, that he's reviewed thousands of films, and that five stars give one only so much leeway in providing a sense of scale. But even those mitigating factors can't account for Maltin's inconsistencies.""Blank Check"" as good as ""Bladerunner?"" ""Space Jam"" and ""Much Ado About Nothing"" equally well made? ""Titus"" and ""Addams Family Values"" feature the same quality filmmaking?Given that a) his reviews are frequently flawed and b) most of them are online at the IMDB anyway, I can't imagine why you'd buy this book."
2,He seems to have a problem with great movies.,"Okay. There are some good things about the book. It has basically every movie ever made in it and some reviews appear to be accurate. I have a problem with someone giving such films that are universely considered great, bad ratings. I'll start with Taxi Driver getting 2 out of 4 stars. That is a crime against humanity. Amadeus 2 and a half out of 4 stars. Are you kidding? The original Godfather got 3 and a half but certainly one of the top 5 films of all time deserves a 4. The Cider House Rules getting a 4 still shocks me every time I see it. Forrest Gump, The Green Mile, Shawshank Redemption, and Crouching Tiger all got 2 and a half stars. God help us all!"
1,Bag o Sha,"Let's drop the average for Lenny's book a notch for his panning of the great movie Kingpin, which does have heart, contrary to what this buffoon says. It seems that all of Lenny's taste is in his mouth.Bah.Save you pennies and visit some online dvd-review sites as well as reading other customer views, it will certainly be more comprehensive."
1,Amazon should add a BOMB rating!,"I cannot believe the rave reviews this book has gotten.It's so bad,it makes reading an educational book look like a truckload of fun.Leonard Maltin used to be a great critic and was right up there with Roger Ebert.After reading this book, Leonard Maltin is such a bad critic he should give himself a ticket! His reviews are terribly written.There short, unsensible and he NEVER explains why the film was bad or good.Example,his review of Friday The 13th Part 2 was like this-""More nubile campers and bloody executions.If you loved Part 1..."" What kind of dumb a$$ review is that? That isn't helpful one bit.He gave all of the Phantasm philms a 1.5,most of the Halloween's bad reviews and gave countless other movies terrible reviews.This book should go out of print.Anyone who owns this should burn it.Just stick with other movie review books but avoid this. I rate this piece BOMB!"
1,How did this ever get published?,"I need to put at least one star because Amazon says I have to. I have seen his reviews and disagreed with every single one of them. I went out and tried reading this book, and as far as I am concerned, this is the worst book I have ever seen. This person, as far as I am concerned, is a complete joke. Never listen to anything this book has to say."
2,A Catalog Of Movies But An Empty Catalog,"This man is good at making encyclopedias but is overrated as a reviewer. Sometimes he is condescending, often he is a bootlicker. You do not have to get a new movie guide just because the calendar is changing but if you have to, this is just not the one."
1,Traitorous,"How any man who considers himself a serious film critic (much less a writer) can assemble a book with 20,000 film reviews without ever once mentioning the screenwriter is appalling. Hey Leonard, everyone one of those films that you've made a fine living off of originated with one creative person with a blank page. It's called the writer, which you failed to cite, oh, about 20,000 times. The fact that this man is used by IMDB.com is galling, an insult to every writer in the industry. Maltin is not a writer, he's not even a friend to the writer. Which is also why no one should buy this book. Not this year, not next year, not ever."
2,buy this if you want to be depressed,"A holiday movie this is not. Set just before Christmas this movie follows a-day-in-the-life of two street hustlers. It starts depressing and goes down from there. If you have someone on your christmas list that you just can't stand, send them this."
2,poor reviews.,"leonard maltin doesn't provide very good reviews of movies. he usually only references the plot, and not the visual style or artistic direction of the film. there is a whole lot of information about actors and whatnot, but this all can be found on the internet for free! most of his reviews are very far off from my personal opinions, so i personally wouldn't recommend this book."
1,Leonard Maltin - Worst critic?,"Gee's! I cannot beleive that this guy has enough guts to publish ... this. People, film-goers alike, just go out and buy or rent a movie your interested in. Because chances are, reading his book will almost deter your judgement of a movie you might come to like. Almost every movie this guy has some sort of problem with. Length, acts, ending, acting, story. Nothing is settles this guys boat. I recommend using your own opinion on what you think is good or not. This book just isn't worth it, and that goes for his reviews as well..."
5,The most valuable single-volume film resource,"I purchase two of these every year (one for work, one for home). You don't get a Maltin book for its insightfulness or incredible film criticism. You get it because you know that one of the Baldwins was in MIAMI BLUES but you can't remember which. Or while watching AMC you wonder if you're watching the original MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY or the second one (or third, fourth, etc.) His ratings are pretty much beside the point."
1,Biased,"I was disappointed with the book. I felt that Leonard Maltin was biased to the point where you could tell who his favorite actors and actresses were. If you were a celebrity he disliked, you would not be able to get a good review out of him to save your life. He particularly likes to target Patrick Swayze for his bad ones. Bad remarks range from Patrick's hair to the way he looks in the clothing he wears in a particular movie. Hair does not have anything to do with the movie or the actor's acting skill."
2,Hardly worth the time,"Maltin seems to have this stupid ideal in his head that any film produced before 1950 and anything Steven Spielberg directs is an instant classic. When the hell is he going to wake up and notie that all those hollywood films of the golden era have lost all their shine and hardly invoke anykind of emtiont at all. Also the 100 best list is laugably bad, come on is Fargo really that great, is Gone with the Wind really the greatest film of all time ? No way. And whay ar Fitzcarraldo or little woman, two filsm be both gave four stars to and came out in the last twenty years not the list. It is a brutally inconsitant book. Some one should tell him to stop having fun and look at the movies content. Despite all the bad mounthing films of the 90 have had they are fdar supeior to films of the 20, 30 40 50, and so on. And spielberg is no where near the director he makes him out to be."
1,Horrible Book,If it was possible to be more synical I am sure Leonard would have found a way. This is probably the worst book I have ever seen or read. If you have the money to buy this book you are better off flushing it down the toilet and throwing a dart at the paper from 10 paces to figure out the movie to see. Leonard's taste runs up there with curdled milk so if that's your taste this is the man to tell you what to think about the movies.
5,Great price for this product!,I just started using this so I can't comment much on the effectiveness. But my local medispa sells the kit for $180 so to get the same thing for $60 through Amazon is a great deal! Delivery took between 5-6 days.
3,Too strong,This product was very strong. I do not recommend it for anyone with even semi senstive skin. It did not smell nice either.
4,Please restock soon!!!!,"I bought this product 5 months ago and now it's almost gone. Please restock this soon because I can't live without it. This makes your skin a little bit dryer than normal, but it's okay rather than having acnes."
5,Fantastic!,Great products. I knew I needed a 1-2-3 set and what I was using prescribed by my dermatologist was not working (Differin). The clenser does a great job. The second step product makes your face feel great and your face so clean. The third step product dries and heals and my face does not become flaky.The texture of my skin is so smoothe. I went to another doctor for facial resurfacing and Obagi is the product they promote.I was looking for something for my acne and found this product line. The price was over $100. Then I went to Amazon.com and found this set for $56.Well worth your money. I needed a moisturizer and looked on line again. I purchased Obagi Clenziderm M.D. Therapeutic Moisturizer from Amazon.com. This product makes my face feel like silk. I love the results.
5,I love this product!!,"I have suffered with acne for pretty much all of my life. I tried everything from proactiv to cleansing and nothing helped. I have been using the obagi product for about 2 weeks now and notice that my skin is very smooth, clearing up and no breakouts lately. I will buy this product for the rest of my life if I have to"
5,Worth the money,Good product for the money. Have been using to prepare a car for paint. Very happy with purchase. Case is sturdy and comes with two pads.
5,Mini DA orbital sander is quite the powerhouse,Product works well and I have used all grits of paper all the way up to 3000 on aluminum car parts followed by buffing and have achieved fantastic results. Tool does use a lot of air and will quickly drain 30 gallon units of the required pressure to make the tool work properly. Best used on a large compressor or you'll have to wait for the air volume and psi to pump back up.
3,Beautiful music blended with birds,"The cover to this CD says ""Escape to a tranquil retreat where soothing piano and cello melodies blend with the peaceful sounds of nature.""I really enjoyed the music on this CD and would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the ""peaceful sounds of nature"" that accompany it. Those peaceful sounds are basically birds chirping through the entire CD. Don't get me wrong, I love to sit outside and listen to the birds, but the ones on this CD never stop or get soft enough to enjoy the music.If I listen to this CD again, it will be outside during the summer so that I won't notice the birds quite so much."
2,Incomplete,"It was so inexpensive compared to the exorbitant cost of a new one, that i kept it anyway - in spite of the missing disks. I bought this because of the Medici's performance of ... i think it was op 132 that i heard on the radio. All the late quartets were missing in my shipment. The Medici are a fine quartet. Minus 3 stars for the dealer."
2,Mediocrity Is No Price Bargain,"... In comparison to the performances of the Quartetto Italiano, the Vegh, the Guaneri, and the Lindsay string quartets, the Medici interpretations are wooden and, frankly, student-like. The former ensembles bring a living spirit to their music-making while the Medici ""just play the notes"" (albeit with a fine recording).These works are so seminal to the advancement of music and culture that it behooves the even casual listener to pay a bit more to actually experience Beethovenia. (The Kodaly Quartet on Naxos present a good price point/musical excellence ratio.)"
4,Excellent.,"This is an excellent 8-disc set containing all of Ludwig van Beethoven's string quartets. They were originally recorded by the Medici String Quartet from 1988 to 1990. The Medici Quartet, which at the time of the recordings was the resident quartet at the University of York in Britain, plays these masterpieces with great sensitivity and a high degree of musicianship. The discs' sound quality is first rate, and the recording venue - The Maltings (formerly a medieval brewery, and now a world class music hall) in the British town of Snape, Aldeburgh - adds the necessary feeling of warmth and intimacy to the recordings.This inexpensive CD set, containing all of Beethoven's string quartets, is truly an excellent bargain! Although these are not the most penetrating readings of Beethoven's string quartets, the Medicis play them flawlessly, and make listening to them an exceptionally enjoyable listening experience."
4,"Overall, great value","I have not heard too many entire sets of the Beethoven Quartets but I would be shocked if there is one set with 16 outstanding performances. It just does not happen. This bargain set has 13 excellent performances out of 17 (it also includes the opus 29 quintet). The weak performances are from opus 18: Nos. 1, 4 and 6 plus opus 95. I found the rest to be quite wonderful, especially opus 74, 127 and 135. This 8 CD set costs the same as two full-priced CDs. You can't go wrong at that price."
2,Inferior Recording Quality,"I really can't comment on the performances in this box set because I couldn't get past the sub-par recording quality. Stick with Barenboim's fine set on EMI, a nicely recorded and outstanding performance at a bargain price."
1,Disappointed,Very heavy-handed playing. I was very discouraged that I spent money on this set and am unable to use it.
1,pvc drain gate,"wasted my money. could not use them. pik shows only top view and no dimensions or side view. I thought they would be about 1/4"" thick and they came at 4 "" thick. it did not pay me to send them back as the freight cost would have me losing more money. shipping costs were much too high. so I bite the bullet and take my $13.+ loss here. bill joiner"
3,Aberrant supplements shed some light on the world.,"The world that is the Aberrant storytelling game has recieved a shot in the arm by this supplement, Expose Aberrant. Delving into aspects of the Aberrant faction, we are shown evidence of a Utopian conspiracy of incredible bredth. Perfect for any storyteller who runs an anti-Utopia chronicle, of for those who simply want to fluch out the world that they play in. My only complaint would be that the book is too short. A mere 24 pages, this book can't quite cover every aspect to a satisfactory extent. If you do not run Aberrant campaigns, or if you want better value out of a book, this isn't for you. If you are intrigued by the Aberrant faction, and don't mind the length, then this is a solid expansion of the game."
5,really nice shoes,"I bought this ones for my mom, she love them.1- comfortable.2- fresh.3- well constructed.4- great bang for the buck."
3,"Great book in 1997, but somewhat dated","This book was written in 1997 and containseffective systems for that time. But markets havechanged since then. Most of these systems useend of day indicators and only buy at the opening or close.Other systems are dated. (One of thesystems is based on the discontinued T-Bill futures contract.)But for someone new to strategy trading, the book doesintroduce some interesting concepts and shows howTradestation can be used effectively for backtesting."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,The quality of the recording is very poor and has ambiant sound all the way thru and is very distracting-Very poor duplicating quality.If you have heard a good meditation tape with a person who is skilled you will realize this is a weak attempt to change the listener. The induction is poor and the suggestions for change were usless. There are many People with huge following and they are followed for a reason I would suggest you use a reputable person or company for this kind of Help.
3,Fluid Feel Copper,"I like this product, but not for what I intended...color. I helps my hair hold a style better and makes my hair feel thicker, however I don't notice much of a change or brightness in the color arena."
1,This is not the correct movie,OK this is the correct tittle and cover but the movie is not killer priest!! Such a let down!! Look'd over the reviews and this is not the 1st time!!
3,Digestive relief,"I have ibs so things(food) don't go through so fast. and you windup bloated and miserable. This tape makes everything digest much better and faster,so I'm not so uncomfortable.You feel inches going. Don't think it's going to get rid of hundreds of pounds, but you definitely feel good.Eat right and exercise and use the tape..."
5,Compré este libro en el Aeropuerto de Tijuana...,"el vuelo había sido malo, con mucha turbulencia, y me sentía lejos de casa, porque aun me faltaban muchas horas para regresar con mi famlia..Pero ESTE LIBRO FUE UN HALLAZGO PROVIDENCIAL !Derrama ternura, belleza y LO MEJOR DEL ESPÍRITU HUMANO...Si lo leen, les dejará calorcito en el corazón y un fresco sabor en la boca.Me pareció FUERA DE LO COMÚN !"
5,ME GUSTA MAS QUE CUALQUIER LIBRO,DE CALDOS..HISTORIAS REALES QUE TE LEVANTAN EL ESPÍRITU Y TE RECONOCILIAN CON EL SER HUMANO !
1,Don't waist your money.,"The first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame. Two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit. The seller forwarded the photos and complaint to Texsport and they sent us another top. When we put that top on we found the same thing. That is when we found the frame was 4"" longer than the top. There were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner. After cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together. When next spring comes we will replace this one and I can assure you it will not be a Texsport product."
2,screen tent,"I purchased this screen arbor for protective coverage outside but the material portion is hard to fit over the piping to tie it down. Next the piping that holds the form is not at all sturdy. the first time the wind picked up, it blew the whole thing apart. So for a one time use it is okay...The money spent on this was a waste. It also looked in places like it had already been repaired. (seconds) as in 2nd class merchandise."
3,Some small things about this product i did not like,"The appearance of the product is fine, it was easy to ensamble, but i noticed some details about the top that i did not like the edges where the plastic is sawed has a lot of small holes that is making the water to go inside the tent, and also it has a part of the top that seems to be like ragged, and from the inside it seems that its going to brake. The screen also has some small details that seems that its going to brake too."
1,piece of junk- do not purchase,yes this unit looks great on the picture- and you might like it at first as long as the screening is not matted and open seams like mine was- this meant that the material was dry rotted- it took a couple of weeks (6) for the roof material to split- but it did.. right on the day the return policy expired- did Amazon honor it- yes- but it had to be shipped that day-June 6th.. I would have to tear it down- repack it- attach the info- but the 6th was a Sunday- the day I found the rip and researched returning it-- if I were you I'd buy it somwhere else- but buy a Colemen or another brand
2,Not good quality,I used to watch this video as a kid so I bought it on DVD for my child! It is really poor quality. I can't believe Disney would put out a product like this. It is not digital or HD.
2,Just ok,"We bought this for our 3 year old and 20 month old. The Peter Pan song was good, but they got bored with the rest - the cartoon/animations look dated and the video/audio quality isn't as good as Disney's newer songs. They loved the Disney Princess volume 1 singalong, this one was just ok."
1,Sorry - I wanted to like it.,"I never got to hear this CD. I have a dance studio and was looking fr a specific piece of music. I believe the product was defective. I ordered , returned and reordered the CD. Each CD was defective. I was so looking forwarad to listening to the material. Hope the problem is solved."
3,Not For a True Scot!,"Don't buy this CD if the thought of hearing traditional bagpipe melodies accompanied by piano and guitar makes you cringe! Not much of this CD is pure pipes, or even pipes and drums for that matter. This CD might be for you, though, if you don't mind the sound of other instruments with the pipes. Some of the selections are hard to find anywhere else."
3,Again & Again,The cover out does the music. Not bad but more of the same. ya gotts love the ceol mor to keep buyin these same old Pipe Band Cds.
1,Good piping but bad songs,YES it is good piping and the man is a good piper however the choice of songs is not enjoyable listening music. If you what good-old bagpipes this is not for you. If your looking for elevator bagpipe music then this is it. I gave my copy away after the first review.
2,The straps fell off,The straps fell off one after another. When the first one did (after a week of waring) I took it to a workshop and they said that the connector is not any of standard sizes so they had to make one specially for it. About one more week the second one broke. I fixed it too. About a month later the straps just did not look good. And since it's not a tipical size it was not easy to find a nice replacement for it. So I just gave up and don't ware this watch any more.
1,Uncomfortable,The backs of this shoe are very stiff and have no padding. Other models that look the same have heel padding. This shoe caused many blisters and had an abnormal amount of break in period. I would have sent them back if possible.
5,Best version,"I bought this set before the Penguin Guide rated it (after hearing it on radio). I have gone through various versions of these pieces; some of my best loved music is here. The Franz Schubert play it with the softness and sweetness that suits them. The sound is natural and warm, and imaging is excellent. If you are considering a modern recording of this music in a comprehensive set, this is the version to get."
3,the acoustics of a football stadium,"There is way too much reverb in this CD. Instead of recording in a studio, the Schubert Quartet recorded in the Nimbus Concert Hall, a venue with the acoustics of a bathroom. The sounds of the quartet jumble and muddy as their playing bounces off the walls of the hall and mix together at different times. The result, certain players sound like they're coming in too late or too early...not exactly a great effect for Mozart pieces. In Mozart, everything has to be crisp and metronomical or else it sounds messy. What we get in this recording is not the filet mignon, but the sloppy joe sandwich."
5,Jake??????????????????,"I really want something romantic to happen with JAke,whether its with Sam or someone else.Anyway,more romance and a little more datail and insught about Sam,but other than that this sereis is really good,andI think its getting better than the thoroughbred sereis.P.S.More about Jake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,review for the phantom stallion Dark Sunshine,This is a very good book and from one of my favorite authors. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes horses or maybe even someone who does not like horses so much. This is one of the best books i have ever read and i could not put it down because it was so good.I hope you will read this book and enjoy it as much as i did.thanks sage :)
2,Disappointing,"I have an eight-year-old Lab/Weimeraner mix who seems to be able to chew through anything and everything.This was no exception. She destroyed the Fleecy Tug Toy in a matter of minutes.Hence, I am still in search of something more durable."
1,thought I would get three,"This product was shown as three tugs and I looked everywhere to see if it specified that it was only one tug but it didn't say so I assumed since the picture showed three, that I would get three. Well, only one came. Seems like false advertising to me. Not cool."
4,The dog loves this toy,"I bought this after seeing something similar at a friends house. They said they have had it for a few years. My dog is not much into playing with the tradition ropes or toys, but LOVES this... Only thing is, it seems to not hold up as well as I hoped (more the fault of my dog then the product). It may just be that my dog wants to tear into it and rip it to shreds, so we don't keep it out until we are going to play.I need to look at pricing out the material and maybe start making them myself, but the price was reasonable having it already braided."
2,"Good Price, Great while it lasts... BUT...","Unfortunately, this item only lasted about five minutes out of the box with my dog. I don't even have a big dog... a 20 lb Pug/Boston mix, and he's currently chewing on the 5 pieces this thing has turned into... For the few minutes we were able to play tug, it felt good on my hands, and he seemed to like the feeling on this teeth/gums, but it ripped just within the next few mins after that"
5,ONE OF THE BEST IN THE SERIES!,"I loved the third book in the series of Abby Hayes, called REACH FOR THE STARS. Ms.Bunder and Ms.Kantor are having a play, and it turns out to be ""Peter Pan"". Abby wants a big part, like Wendy or Captain Hook. But when she auditions, things go unexpected. Abby doesn't get the part she wanted-exactly. She gets a part that is the biggest and best and most important in the play. Everything turns out fine, and everyone is happy. That is, everyone expect Brianna :). This was a great book and I enjoyed because I love acting. Get a copy of this book soon!"
5,Anne Mazer,"Anne Mazer is a very gifted writer and her stories of a young girl, Abby, and the troubles she and her friends encounter are just as magnificent. This series is certainly for a younger crowd but I still enjoy it. Six- eight year olds are sure to love it!"
5,....but I recomend buying something else,"Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z have always had so many of the elements needed for a great anime series: drama, suspense, action, comedy. This tape is a good example.Why recomend not buying a DBZ title despite it being so good? The companies who make it don't know how to treat the fans. I have been to a site that shows under upcoming releases what Funamation will publish the rest of this year from the DBZ series. None of the titles include anything from the Cell Games. Holding out on us fans, not publishing the last episodes of a saga before starting a new one seems to be a habit that is just getting worse. Nothing is planned for this saga for the rest of the year. What good is a story without the ending? This is the best anime series I have seen, but the publishers are killing it for us fans leaving us hanging in the end."
4,Preatty good!,This video tape is one of the best dragonballz episodes ever.It shows at the beggining how goku and cell power up(which is really awsome)and then they start to fight.Cell uses some of the Z fighter's attacks and then goku shows a new attack.........the instant transmission technique!In the middle goku puts a lot of energy into the kamehameha but he is at such a height that if he fires it at cell who is below it will destry the whole earth!!Goku uses the instant transmission technique and appears in front of cell and fires the kamehameha.Everyone thinks that he is dead but he regenarates himself and starts to attack goku.Since goku put so much energy into the kamehameha he was not able to defeat cell and so he lost.Then it ends with goku giving up.This episode is really great!!!!!
5,Visions of an unfettered mind,"Bernard Smith is a genius. This book, and anything else you can find by him, are required reading if you're interested in proas, high speed sailing, or just a very smart engineer's logical look at how to move fast on water powered by the wind. Starting with models, he works his way up to full sized speed sailing designs. One very nice thing is that Mr Smith was never a professional boat designer, so he tells the truth about what worked, what didn't, and what broke. Boats like Sailrocket owe everything to him, as they've said themselves; if you think SR is cool, read this and you'll understand better where it came from. I've read my copy about fifteen times, and will again. Highly recommended."
2,Not worth much.,This book is interesting but really doesn't give much usable information for the boat builder. There is some talk about theory but nothing of any help to someone who might want to build any boats.
4,Great ideas at great prices!,"What else could you want, a book that shows you fabulous interiors and how to design them at a very reasonable price? Beautiful photos, incredible ideas, shows you how to use what you have to have a modern/shabby chic look with gorgeous inexpensive touches you can do yourself! Buy this book! Great value and fabulous for those on a tight budget. Mine is already curled on the cover from looking through it so many times. And every time I find a new idea. How many books can you say that about?"
1,Miles of Troupe,"Troupe is an outstanding poet and performer of his words, he was also Miles Davis's biographer, and has written a memoir of that relationship which is redundant, self-serving, fan-mag ooze which makes one reconsider the biography Troupe assembled from taped interviews with Davis, perhaps the most durable and ominpresent jazz soloist since Louis Armstrong. Published by a University press obviously trying to hit the trade marketplace, this slim volume reads like it were much longer."
1,Self Serving Gossip,"Troupe continues to lower himself with this book. It hasalready been demonstrated that much of Miles's so called autobiographywas ( ) -- Troupe copied things wholesale from earlierbiographies and magazine articles. Now he stoops to this jumbled collection of half truths that aren't all that interesting in the first place. Was Troupe really Miles best friend -- probably not, but who cares? We should be interested in the music and the creative process -- Troupe, who used to be a poet, should be able to address these things -- but doesn't even make an effort -- END"
4,An intriguing view of a Legend.,"I enjoyed both books written about Miles by Quince Troupe. In my opinion Troupe has the uncanny ability to write from a perspective that allows a reader to see the personal side of his subject. Troupe's ""no holds barred"" approach permits the reader to form their own opinion and paint their own picture. This book portrays Miles as both a legend and human being who confronts life's challenges in both positive and negative ways. Be sure to read this book with an open mind. Sometimes it hurts to see our heroes, who we've placed on such a high level fail in some areas of life."
4,Gets just about as close as you can get to a legend.,"I just picked up the ""Bitches Brew Complete Sessions"" on CD. Troupe has a long essay in the liner notes that are seemingly taken right from this book (or vice versa). Given there are so many Miles Davis books out there, I have to say I really like Quincy Troupe's approach because he is not some music professor or cultural critic analyzing or deconstructing Miles and ""the meaning"" of his music, blah, blah, blah. Rather, Troupe was there with Miles in the same room, in the car, eating dinner, wherever. That's the real value of this book. If you put Miles on that high pedestal you may not want to read the book: Troupe details some incredibly awkward and tense situations with Miles's temper which made everyone run for cover; but there are also moments of showing Miles with his force field down. One can only imagine how fascinating and frustrating it would be to meet, let alone have a friendship with, one of your idols."
3,Great to have a 2 in one,I bought this cd because of Artistry which was not available on cd. The highlight for me was superstrut but I don't understand why it was edited from the original LP version. The intro solo from John Tropea's guitar is missing from this recording.
1,Something is wrong,"The artwork implies that the songs from the Whirlwinds LP will be on this CD. Not a single track from Whirlwinds shows up on the list of songs as of 2 Nov 2010, namely missing are: Moonlight Serenade, Ave Maria, Do It Again, West 42nd St, Havana Strut, and Whirlwinds."
5,Exceptional Book to Read Together,This is a great interactive book for younger kids...and I found myself as an adult playing with the mixed up pages to make funny Disney characters. Definitely great for Disney or non-disney fans alike.
1,Disney's Mix & Match Villains Book review,Who are the ad wizards that come up with this? What does this book teaches us? How to play God by switching heads and other limps? OK so it's for kids but that what disturbes me the most. It's almost like playing Amatur Surgoen but with no blood. I feel sorry for who ever thinks this is for kids. I give this book a 1 out of 10.
2,Not so much....,"I hate to be negative in these reviews, but I bought this a couple of weeks ago, and I can't really say a whole lot that is positive about it. The arm band clips slip and the armband gets twisted when you try to snug the IPOD to your arm.I am looking to get another armband sometime in the near future."
1,"Poor fit, lousy design","This comes with an arm band and an armband extension. One would have to have enormous bicips (over 20"") to use the extention. The single arm band is too tight, and becomes uncomfortable after running for a while. One of the worst designs I've every seen in product."
2,Armband size is stupid,"The other reviews here about the armband are spot on. It's not elastic, so it can't stretch. The armband is comprised of two pieces, although it's possible to use just one, but using just one makes it too small, and using both makes it too long. I can't believe that belkin had this type of oversight on such a basic aspect of ipod case"
2,Decent ipod cover but one thing missing,"I like this ipod cover and it fits the standard 20G ipod...but the one thing to note is that there is no hole in the top for the earphones to plug into the ipod, it completely covers the top of the ipod and this makes no sense what so ever."
2,Birds and Guitar,"Having several other Atmospheres' CDs of guitar music that I absolutely love, I was looking forward to this one. Had I seen a review mentioning the bird sounds, I would have avoided it. Aside from the opening chirping on most pieces, several seem to have someone humming along with the piece, an effect that distracted me from the guitar music. Although each piece is different, within the selections the repetition is tiresome. In one the two note combination was like an annoying drip. In another I wanted to tell the artist he had those four notes to perfection and to move on. It has several good songs and some may enjoy its lulling effect."
4,"Good for Asian-style food, but pricey per serving","I purchased 3 types of these noodles at my regular grocery store in the refrigerated area where tofu is sold. The package says ""Keep Refrigerated"", so it is a little puzzling that these can be sold and then shipped with no refrigeration. The cost per 2-serving bag was $1.99, and there were two modest portions in the bag. Upon opening the bag, I smelled a rather strong, somewhat fishy order. I immediately strained and rinsed the noodles, then I placed them in a pan with some expeller-pressed peanut oil and warmed them (they didn't brown). I decided to add some canned bean sprouts (1/2 large can, drained), Guilin hot chili sauce, water, garlic powder, and coconut sap sugar (3 - 4 tsp.)It tasted pretty good."
5,THESE NOODLES ARE FANTASTIC!!!!,"I read all the good and bad reviews and I tried these noodles anyway. The Shirataki noodles are not like your standard noodles and they have to be rinsed twice and I microwave them for 2.5 to 3 minutes and they turn out fine. Let them drain for about 15-30 minutes after putting them in the microwave. I'm on Weight Watchers and love soups in the winter and these work perfectly. I was a little skeptical because I had to purchase 10 bags at one time but I have let my friends and Weight Watchers classmates try these and they are wonderful. Yes, they have a fishy smell but with the proper care you don't smell them. Yes, they are a little rubbery and taste a little different than your average noodles, but remember they are from the Japanese yam family. You have to give a little to get a little and these work great. Try them you won't be sorry!!!!"
1,I really tried to like these,"The other day, my husband and I were having spaghetti for dinner, so I boiled the Shirataki noodles for a few minutes and then tried to eat them. The taste wasn't bad, then I tried to chew them and the texture was really weird. I had to chew a lot more than I really wanted to. I finally gave up and ate my spaghetti sauce with real pasta."
5,These are surprisingly good!,"I agree with other reviewers--those that commented negatively must not know how to prepare these correctly. It took me a little trial and error too. Once you open them, they do have a seafood-like scent. But after you rinse and drain, heat, they're ready to go! They're good in a cream/cheese sauce or red sauce. I also have made them with cream of mushroom soup and a little tuna, as well as a pesto sauce. On to a Chinese type dish next. Hungry-Girl rocks!"
3,Ya Gotta Eat,"Hey, it's got nothing bad in it. Ya wanna eat pasta, it's a weak, but acceptable alternative. I rinsed, then microwaved it for a minute and that eliminated the stink. then rinsed again, dried it, added sauce and heated some more. Chewy but not so bad."
4,Shirataki Pasta,"I ordered a couple of packages of these...the shipping took FOREVER (close to a month) - the noodles taste almost identical to ""real"" pasta...I'll order again!"
1,Terrible shipping,It took over a month to get my product and there was no correspondence between the customer service and me. I am not happy with the order or the process.
2,"Good product, terrible shipping","We like the noodles we got, but the problem I have is it took over a month and a half to get the product. That is not acceptable when I pay over $14 for shipping. If I pay that much to get a few noodles I expect to have them is a week. You have a problem in that department."
2,Ordered on Jan 23 still have yet to receive,"I place my order on Janaury 23 for the noodles. Due to overwhelming demand the supplier ran out and I had to wait for restocking. Once the item was restocked, 2/9, I was sent an E-mail with a link to UPS. After a few days, 2/13, the status of my package went from ""receiving billing information"" to ""exception"". The package was damaged in transit and has yet to be replaced, it's now 2/23. Seller is so-so about responding to communication (they usually respond it's just they are not quick about it) and until I actually receive the product, I am very hesitant to use this seller again."
1,Most disgusting mistake of my life...,"I tried these noodles after the numerous recommendations made by the website HungryGirl, but I must say that these noodles are the MOST disgusting thing I have ever eaten. If you want to get these noodles, I highly suggest you get one pack to try before stocking up (as I did), because you will most likely be left with packs of noodles you won't want to eat. These noodles have the most unbearable smell, and no amount of rinsing and microwaving I did could remove the horrendous stench. Additionally, they were so oddly chewy and gelatinous that it is difficult to eat them. You kind of have to knaw on them to get them to break off into bites. The nutritionals are great, but they are so not worth any calories you save...they taste horrible and you'd wish you'd eaten nothing than waste 40 calories on these noodles!"
2,Mushy,"I really tried to like these, I don't even remember ordering them on line as they are in my local supermarket. First you have to get over the fishy smell when you open them even after rinising well they smell and then they are mushy. I've tried them several ways and to me I'd rather just eat a smaller portion of pasta as these don't satisfy at all."
4,"Try it, you might like it...","It is nice to see so many people posting positive reviews for this product. When I first read about it in Peoples ""Diet"" magazine, I couldn't wait to purchase it and try it. Then I read several reviews and they were all bad. I decided to give it a try anyway and... Yum, I'm placing another order. The smell everyone refers to is really quite mild and washes away immediately when you rinse the noodles. They are chewier than regular noodles but filling and satisfying with only 40 calories, 1 gram of fat, and about 4 grams of carbs for an entire bag."
1,not worth it,"I purchased a bag of these per reccomendation of a friend of mine, I opened the bag, and yes it smelled, I put the noodles in boiling water for 3 minutes and when I drained them the smell was pretty much gone. I mixed them with a cream cheese/sour cream sauce recipe on the back of the package. The texture was disgusting, I could only swallow a few bites before I spit it out. It was rubbery and almost impossible to chew. I don't understand how reviewers could say that I must have cooked it wrong, I followed the directions."
1,Shirataki,"Disgusting. This is not anything like pasta so do not be fooled. It is tofu and it smells and tastes like tofu. If you do not particularly enjoy tofu, do not buy this product."
1,"Bad smell, odd texture","I was considering order a multi pack of these online, I thought it sounded great enough since I'm on a diet. Luckily I happened upon some single bags at my local grocery store and bought one to try. I made some lovely home made pesto to pour on top. As soon as I opened the bag I noticed the horrid smell! So unappetizing and foul. I rinsed the heck out of them, boiled the noodles up in fresh water, put some in my mouth, and spit it right into the trash. The smell was still there and the texture reminded me of the squishy yet pop-ish texture of shrimp, which thoroughly disgusted me since I'm now vegan. I would not recomend this product to anyone. I just cant get past the odd smell and the worse texture."
1,Sweet mother of Mercy NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"This was the worst thing I have ever ingested. I was sold with the SUPER low calorie and fat intake, but it was too good to be true. It tasted like non food. It tasted like rubber bands in sauce. Or squid. It was terrible and now I have bags and bags of it going straight to the garbage. I think the bags should stop by the lab first for testing, because there's some sort of mistake. This couldn't possibly have been meant to be eaten. People are not that cruel.Try for yourself. I kid you not."
1,Not what I thought,I have been hearing such great things about these noodles. Unfortunately they were not anything like what I have heard. Proceed with this purchase with caution.
1,"If it seems to good to be true, IT IS!","I was dying to get my hands on these after reading such wonderful endorsements. I had nothing but high hopes. I was totally open minded. I thought it seemed too good to be true (low cal no carb noodles!) but hey, I'm an optimist. Guess what? It is too good to be true! I read about washing them and drying them. I did. No problem. I added sauce. I put them in my mouth. The taste was not the problem it was the texture. It was seriously like chewing rubber bands. No noodle resemblence whatsoever. I honestly can't understand those who rave about these, but, hey, to each his own."
3,Welll....,If you want to get these items cheaper...I saw them at Sprouts and Whole foods if there is one close by.. =)
3,...if you like al dente...,"Not bad for a 40-calorie substitute for a 190-calorie food. As long as you follow the prep directions to wash & parboil the noodles, they are palatable. I like al dente noodles, so the texture did not bother me."
1,Ew.,"These noodles have a terrible, squidy texture and a wholly unpleasant smell. They cook strangely and taste odd."
3,"Tofu Shirataki, fettuccini shaped","The tofu shirataki was everything it was claimed to be--not much to my liking, however. But I am glad that I tried it and will move on from here. The service from Amazon.com was terrible, the shipping charged-outrageous, plus the amount of time it took the item to arrive was unacceptable. I will never again purchase from Amazon.com, and will advise friends and family to follow suit."
3,Shiratki Fettucini,Delivery was delayed several weeks and not notified of delays. I had to keep e-mailing to make sure it was coming. Taste is OK but it will never make you forget the real thing.
1,thoroughly disgusted,"After watching an advertisement for the tofu noodles on t.v. I decided to try them because they were supposed to taste ""just like pasta."" That statement is a COMPLETE LIE, actually they taste just like rubber bands. They taste TERRIBLE. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,Tofu Shirataki Noodles,They tended to be too chewy for pasta. Being Italian I guess I wasn't use to this.
2,Shirataki Noodles,"I don't understand all the hype on this product. I bought 6 bags and prepared one for my husband and I for dinner with shrimp. Followed the directions to rinse well. The noodles were chewy and the texture unappetizing. My husband hardly ate any and went without dinner. Maybe I was hoping what they promised was true, but I wouldn't recommend these to anyone who enjoys food."
1,Shirataki Noodles,The noodles taste somewhat normal - but the texture makes them impossible to eat. I have purchased 10 bags and gave to friends to try - none of us were able to actually eat more than a few bites. The texture is like rubber with an added slime - very difficult to chew.
1,I really wanted to like it but...,"I was so hoping to like this product! I need to eat lower carb foods, and hoped that this product would deliver. The package came in & the smell was bad, but not as horid as suggested. After par boiling it was much better. I cooked the noodles & put on sauce $ cheese. The texture was not good. It was like chewing pieces of rubber. The noodles even squeaked on my teeth sort of like a balloon would sound...wierd. Suffice it to say that I could not choke down more than a couple of bites. The worst (and funniest) part was letting my dogs have the plate & watching them first try to chew the noodles, and finally lap only the sauce & cheese up. Save your money. The shipping was killer on this."
2,Not for me,"I found the texture and smell to be a huge turn off. It reminded me of squid and I just could not stomach it. It was rubbery and hard to chew. It did not really have a taste, so if you can get past the smell and texture, these are the noodles for you."
1,House Foods America Corporation Tofu Shirataki,"The product rates as a less than ideal replacement for regular pasta. The texture is slimy and slightly rubbery. I served it in a cream-style sauce with sauteed vegetables and chicken hoping to disguise the pasta, but my family knew right away something was different and they prefer I not buy it again."
1,Really wanted these to work out and be a good substitute!,"Sorry I cooked them 4 different ways and they are just horrible!You just can't get them soft enough to not be chewy and stringeywith no taste....I didn't mind the smell, it washes out but the texture is just wrong,wrong, wrong.....Nancy"
2,Tasted fishy,"I really tried to like this product, but couldn't stomach it. I did rinse the noodles a lot, as recommended, but they just smelled faintly of bad fish to me. -And I like fish!- I was really excited to try this product because I have heard a lot of good things about it and was very eager to find a low cal alternative to traditional noodles, but this just wasn't for me."
4,A Must For Fans,Like many other adventures Of Beavis & Butthead this one is surely a winner. Any Beavis & Butthead fan should have this one even if you are not very familiar with B & B this is a good place to start.
4,Music Videos,Does Amazon include the music videos? iTunes and other services do not and you can't tell from the preview. My suspicion is no so keep this in mind when you purchase.
2,"talk out of your mouth, not out of your butt.","hey!! we can put robots on mars to search for alien life... our president can lie to us and send us to war, killing tens of thousands of innocents... we can even clone goats and cats... surely they can figure out a way to get the full b&b episodes out on disc. figure it out folks and give the people some happiness. all we need is love. no more killing. bad karma!"
1,Cut episodes? No sale!!,"I was so excited to finally get some good B&B; on DVD. But with the dissapointing news that several of these episodes have been cut, I will not be buying this. Chalk this potential sale up as lost, solely due to this idiotic and needless meddling. How about leaving things alone?Hopefully, many others will follow along and this set will be a big money loser. By now, studios should know better then to foist this garbage on the loyal fans."
5,One trick pony,"OK, I haven't seen this DVD. I've more than likely seen the episodes it compiles. My reason for writing this is to question the Amazon review by Paula. To criticize Beavis and Butthead for being a one trick pony while praising South Park seems hypocritical. Anyone who has watched South Park knows that they've been running the same gags in variation. A fascination with fecal matter. The Chef's big chocolate balls. Kenny getting killed. Again. And again.I'm not criticizing SP. I think both cartoons are funny and great. I just question pointing out the failings of one while missing the failings of the other. What's next, accusing Cheers of shooting from a bar a majority of the time while praising Everyone Loves Raymond for the recurring intruding mother?"
3,Joining the chorus of disappointed fans,"As a die hard who purchased the Time Life series a few years ago, I was really looking forward to getting new B&B material. The Time Life set was a nice stand-in until the *real* material came out. Well, this is no better than the first set, and it may even be worse, since some episodes have been edited down. You also have to watch ads every time you pop the DVD in. Unless you are desperate to own B&B material, save your money on this one. They should release every episode in a season-by-season format, but we may never see that dream realized."
1,Thankyouthankyouthankyou,Thanks a million to those reviewers who said some of the episodes were cut. I'm allergic to that kind of thing. I will NOT buy this set. I want the originals or I don't want 'em at all.
1,BIG UPSET,"MTV&Mike judge have ruined Beavis&Butthead show by releasing this dvd, I think they should stop the process of making vol.2 and start seriously fixing this problem by producing the original B&B seasons dvd set."
1,This dvd set SUCKS,"Paramount and Mike Judge, you guys WASTED a golden opportunity here to begin presenting B&B properly on dvd. If the videos are too expensive to license, so be it. But the episodes should be presented in correct chronological order and be UNEDITED. These ""director's cuts"" are an ABOMINATION. Basically Mike Judge, a brilliant comic genious, has SPIT IN THE FANS' FACES and gotten away with it. I bought this set, and quickly noticed that certain episodes are SHORTER than they used to be. Not because the videos are missing, but because some lines of dialogue and some shots and even some full scenes (take a look at the newly shortened ""Late Night with Butthead"") are missing, thanks to Mike Judge's SHAMEFUL ""director's cuts""."
1,A disgrace....,"I would like to thank all the reviewers here who have informed me that this set is censored and altered in an unforgiveable fashion. Mike Judge and MTV should be ashamed of themselves. Who do they think they're protecting? They should show courage and release them uncut.This series was hilarious when it came out, and surprisingly, it hasn't dated at all. Usually stuff in the 1990's is littered with pop culture references that are completely lost in later decades (The Ben Stiller Show, The Critic, even The Simpsons), and it diminishes the impact of the show. This stuff still makes me laugh. As for Judge and MTV refusing (or concealing) the original episodes, they're stupider than Beavis and Butthead for doing that. Get your head out of your hole MTV/Judge and act like adults...."
2,Where are the videos and commentary?,More than half the reason the show was great was the videos and the comments B&B made about them. Maybe it was some sort of copyright deal or something but a lot of the comedy is missing without them. Save your money.
5,the animated version of dum & dumer,"This show is what changed the way we looked at cartoon's for ever. Beavis & Butt-head was created by Mike Judge who also created ""King of the Hill"". I love the episode with the president Bill Clinton came to Highland High School the faculity did the best they can the keep Beavis and Butt-head away from the president by giving them money and premision to cut school to go eat at a taco resturant still they met the commander and chief anyway. One time they stole Tom Anderson riding mow and riding it down the street they panted his cat and used the paint to write all over his house. Beavis one time put a frog in his mouth then spite it out. At school in swim class their teacher Mr. Buss Cut kicked Beavis in the water so he can save his friend Butt-head from drowing in the pool."
3,"Yes, but...","(I'll keep this short, no need to get all long-winded...)I'll give points that this is better than the old low-quality over-the-air VHS tapes I've been trying to put onto DVD, and that they do not cut out the scene in ""Home Improvement"" where they sniff the paint thinner. The documentary was entertaining and informative. Unfortunately, I too was underwhelmed by the ""Director's cut"" episodes.As far as the missing videos go, I have my doubts Kip Winger and others are going to give approval to be lambasted by Beavis and Butthead for mass-market consumption. We're lucky to get what we've got here.Mike, I realize you don't necessarily care for all the episodes; but ""Volume 3 - The REST of Beavis and Butthead"" will probably sell just as well. People who lay down cash for this sort of thing tend to be completists, give 'em what they want."
4,mike judge rocks,finally a B&B-H dvd set thats actually drawn by mike judge. The lack of videos and the commentary of said videos is the only thing about them i didnt like.
1,Sent me the wrong thing and yet still use the image of what I didn't get,It would have cost more to ship it back then to get my money backNononononononoNononoNononoNoNoNo
1,DON'T WASTE 25 BUCKS on this CRAP .LOADED with COMMERCIALS,"DO NOT WASTE 25 BUCKS ON THIS CRAP !!! IF You have a VCR or DVD RECORDER, you are much better off recording them from cable TV. The first disc I watched had 5 minutes of commercials at the beginning for a bunch of MTV CRAP FOR SALE ON VIDEO..YOU CANNOT BYPASS THE COMMERCIALS!! YOU ARE FORCED to WATCH THEM . There is an awful commercial for MTVs JAckass Video and it shows Johnny Knoxville with his pants down, and another stupid-ass commercial for Aeon Flux video.and another commercial for a violent video game..I PAID TO SEE BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD , NOT A BUNCH OF STUPID COMMERCIALS !! THIS DVD SET SUCKS EVEN MORE THEN THE TIME LIFE SERIES...I wish I never opened it, now I cannot get refund and why even bother making this set if Beavis and Butthead ARE NOT WATCHING MUSIC VIDEOS AND RAGGING ON THEM....THIS DVD SET SUCKS"
1,WARNING: Heavily censored and cut up!,"WHY they woudl do this I do not know, but almost every episode has parts missing from them! It's a hack job worse than even the ""revamped"" Star Wars series! Entire minutes of many episodes are flat out missing. This set is a RIP OFF! AVOID IT OR BE SORRY."
2,a major letdown,"the current trend in all DVDs is ""unedited"" ""added scenes"" it seems mike judge missed the boat on his own creation. someone elses review noted that some parts have actually been removed. beavis and butt-head started out as a minor segment on ""liquid television"" and soon became household names (whether or not you agree). the controversy exploded when young kids immitated what they saw (thanks to irresponsible parents that had no clue as to what their own kids were watching)....who cares if mike judge personally selected his own favorites, have each season boxed as originally aired and let the consumer pick his/her favorite ones."
4,Are you Threatening Me?,"""I AM CORNHOLIO! I need teepee for my bunghole!! Do not make my bunghole angry!!!"" Anyone in need of these blissfulscreechings from Beavis' pubescent voicebox need only pop this DVD in the player....Well, in many regards itdoes pale, but the Bad Boys from Highland display the saving grace of finding sexual innuendo in just about *everything* (e.g., when Van Driessen [hippy teacher] says ""I hope this wasn't too hard on you"" and Butt-Head retorts ""huh huh, he said 'hardon.'"")Whereas ""South Park"" is about a crew of eight-year-old smart-[alecs], ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" was about a pair of adolescentdumb-asses, and hence was much better catharsis if you needed a fix of laughing AT people, rather than just WITH them.Best of all is the title episode, in which St. Peter (huh huh, you said 'Peter') demands a full-accounting of Beavis' basically empty life.This is mindless fun at its best, but I agree the music videos should have been included."
2,"Full seasons with videos, please! eh heh!","I would definitely like to see full season releases that show the episodes as they aired... that means WITH the music videos. I was highly dissappointed with the In Living Color DVDs that had some of the music parts edited out, and I'm sure B&B; would be no different. Unfortunately, I think they need the bands' permission, or pay them royalties, in order to make this happen. I guess not all the bands have allowed them to use their videos... maybe it's their revenge for people that download their music for free off the internet!So I will stick with the video tapes that I recorded from MTV, and maybe at some point in time, transfer them to DVD in their entirety myself!"
1,B&B=Music Videos,"The best part of the B&B was the music videos. If Mike Judge were to make new episodes he would have a field day. Popular music sucks more now than in the early 70's. So I ask you, would you want to see these episodes without their comedic bread and butter? They were the only people with enough balls to say this music sucks! Without the videos B&B come off as two mindless idiots. Beavis and Butthead premiered when I was in 7th grade. We were the demographic that made it popular. Give me full episodes including the originally aired music videos or I will leave this set on the shelf alongside its VHS counterpart!"
1,This SUCKS!,"Looks like yet another producer is following in the greedy footsteps of George Luca$. First release what the people don't want, then after they buy it, release another version, and so on. Total waste of money. I refuse to be ripped off like this. NO SALE!You dudes can flush your money down the toilet if you want to. I'll wait for a season by season release and spend my money on beer and nachos and replay the VCR copies."
4,Almost a 5 but...,Almost a 5 but it lacked some episodes plus i wish they included music videos instead of having them seperate i thought that was some b/s but other than that it's a good set that can be watched over and over.
1,"you're a douche, mike judge","I wish I had consulted these reviews before I bought this EDITED set. WHAT'S THIS WORLD COMING TO??? Mr. Judge, you created one of the greatest comic duos of ALL-TIME now you are RUINING the legacy by gutting the cartoons pointlessly.The ""director's CUTS"" are extensive and without any justifiable excuse. Some of my favorite lines are missing, but frankly even if only the lamest jokes had been removed it would still SUCK."
4,"For once, it may not be MTV's fault","Alright, check me if I'm wrong here, but my understanding is that this DVD collection is to include the music videos which were a big part of the television show. The reason why this is merely a collection of, and not a full first season is because not every band is willing to allow the use of their videos on the dvd collection. Now, before everyone begins asking ""Well, they were aired on with videos in tow on MTV, why can't they now?"" Obviosuly, it's about money. Some bands will do anything they can to earn a quick buck, and if they think they can get royalties off the sales of B&B dvd collections, they will try. I think it sucks, but unless every band would agree to the use of their music videos, there will never be a complete satisfactory collection of B&B dvds, because watching them make fun of the videos was one of the funniest parts of the show. Don't blame Mike Judge or MTV, blame the greedy rock stars."
2,"WE WANT AN UNCUT SEASON BOXSET, DANGIT!!!","I demand a box set with all the uncut episodes, EVERY FREAKING ONE OF THEM, with the pilot episodes!!! And a RAW CHICKEN TO SMACK ""HIROKI TSUKUI"" WITH WOULD BE DAMN NICE!!!!!"
1,Edited Episodes: The Final Nail in the Coffin,"Yes, You Heard Right. As if it were'nt bad enough that 60-70 of the episodes won't be made avalable on DVD, at least 5 of the episodes presented as director's cuts are actually missing footage and lines of dialogue. And the worst part is, that the edited episodes were presented 100% UNCUT on the Time-Life DVD'sEdited Episdes:Late-Night with Butthead (The Worst of the Lot, Missing almost 2 minutes of footage.)1-900-BEAVISFigure DrawingTainted MeatHeld Back.This is an Outrage. Mike Judge should be locked up, and never be allowed to touch naother DVD again."
1,Dissapointment,I was very upset when I started watching these don't waste your money it's not fun without the music videos I bought this thinking whatever but I found it to be a waste of money wait till they do somethign about it!
3,huh huh huh... uhhhh....,"yah, so like, they uh, ommitted the music videos or something. that like, sucks. Those were some of the funniest moments!! copyright my... bunghole. This is still good to have for collectors like me, to see a handful of episodes I had actually never seen before, & esp. to see Mike Judge's comments... in person. It was really quite funny to see the creator talk about the show, esp. when he does some of the impersonations... in particular, the influence he got from Mr. Anderson! Most of us have associated the voices as the cartoon characters for so long that it's actually weird to remember that a real person is behind them ;-) But if you happen to have them taped from the good ol' days still, you'll still wanna revert back to those :)"
3,I'm going to have to agree with most everyone,"Although it was great to see Beavis and Butthead again, this format.....Well it sucks!! I can't believe Judge let his masterpiece be shamelessly released like this. There isn't any fluidity to these shows like there was on Mtv. I was and still am a die-hard B&B fan. Judge, please release this little piece of history the way it was ment to be seen, by seasons with all the music videos intact. I know that there probably is a little red-tape involved in adding the music videos (ie. artists royalties), but this is the only way that B&B is ment to be seen!"
2,"Uh, like where are the videos","I dont understand why they didnt put the videos in like when it was on tv. The videos were the best part! I asume its because mtv didn't want to pay royalties to the bands, so they called it the ""Mike Judge Collection"" and left them out. Uh, That Sucks!"
5,You won't even miss the music videos,"This is a great collection. Don't listen to these reviewers who say it's not the same without the music video clips that were included in the MTV series. These two clowns stand on their own.To be able to watch these episodes without constant commercial interruption is alone worth the cost. Beavis and Butthead fans, you don't want to pass this up."
1,I bought this for a gift,I don't like Beavis and Butt-head at all. These items were purchased as a gift for someone who does so I can't really rate them.
5,Taking a trip back to the 90's,"If you enjoyed Beavis and Butt-Head back in the day, then you will enjoy this set. This set is like the others and does not show music videos in the episodes. This takes away from he show, but if you are a fan.....not having the music videos is not a big thing."
2,Pure outrage,"...can not be expressed enough.""History of..."", ""Best of..."", now - this. Slightly altered assortment, repackaged, at a new full price. This is not how capitalism is supposed to work. At this point, nobody should settle for anything less than a *complete* collection sorted by seasons."
1,"No thanks, I'll pass...",I would most definitely buy this set if the videos were left in tact with the episodes. They just add so much more to the show. Since music licensing is such a huge factor then I just don't think B&B is meant to be on DVD. I'll just record episodes off MTV2. I just wish they'd show some of the very early episodes.
1,Hysterical - Censorship = DiSsApPoInTiNg!!!,"I have been waiting for my son to be old enough to ""get"" B&B.; Now that he is we (luckly) rented so far the first 2 discs. I don't usually watch cartoons, BUT Beavis & Butthead have been my favs since day one. That said, I was SO disappointed in these discs. I for one feel cheated, I was looking foward to the B&B; I knew... bad videos & all. OK I know getting the rights to some of the videos would've been a hassle, but at the very least give us the UNCUT eps. ALL the EPS!!!I'm not saying these cd's are a total wash.... NO ..They are funny as all... I laughed so hard I cried with ""The Great Cornholio"" ...now my son understands my need for TP for the...I'll BUY a box set when they come out with an uncut version, let me decide what MY kid watches.I'll just step off my soapbox now...Thank you ;-)"
3,"A Beavis fan's must-have, unfortunately","This DVD is worth it to a Beavis fan for one reason - it's one of the few actual remaining official releases of one of the funniest shows of all time. It's sad, considering at one time there were boatloads of videos similar to this, with many more episodes to choose from. Yeah it totally sucks that the videos aren't around, but this is still worthy viewing to see such a great show unfolded again, in such great quality. Unfortunately, considering its many flaws mentioned by homeboy below, its one of the few of its kind (get the christmas dvd too -- INSANE!)"
2,Just not that good.,"This set really isn't enjoyable. I knew in buying this that the videos would be omitted, and i thought it would still be decent, but the cartoons just don't holdup as well w/out the videos. They haven't aged well. After watching the first two discs, I was thoroughly disappointed, but the 3rd disc (with the standalone videos and other appearances) was decent. B&B; are far funnier when interacting watching videos (a la Mystery Science Theater 3000)and commenting than they are in their episodes. The documentary is halfway interesting, too.It's highly unlikely that MTV will be able to issue these episodes with the videos included on DVD. Hate to say it, but unless you can find the original broadcasts bootlegged, B&B; is best left as a memory. Not worth revisiting on DVD without the music videos.One last note - the holiday bonus disc offered by some retailers contains two B&B; Christmas episodes, nothing more. Again, no videos, and no Butthead whipping Beavis like a reindeer."
3,This Format Sucks Beavis,"I am a diehard Beavis and Butthead fan, which is why I do not like the format for the Mike Judge collections. When I watched the episodes on MTV in the mid-90's, they showed half of an episode, then a video, the rest of the episode, then another video. If you watched B&B; for 30 minutes you usually saw 4 videos. I liked this much better, because I LOVE the videos. On the Mike Judge collection, it is hours of episodes, with the videos separate, which gets kind of long.On another note, all of these DVD's are pretty good, but they are lacking many of the classic episodes. I really wish they would release every single episode AND video commentary, as much for nostalgia as for the humor."
3,Beavis and Butthead is great but...,"It is great that the fans can finally get their B&B, BUT there are many episodes that should have made their way into this collection. Some episodes are missing some scenes. The music videos are not included in the episodes, but thrown on the last DVD. If you are a fan, you may be slightly disappointed."
1,[BAD]! No Music Videos Included!,I can't remember the last time I've been so disappointed with a purchase. The absolute funniest parts of each B&B episode were their interaction while watching camped out on Butthead's couch watching music videos. There is NONE of that in any of the B&B compilations released so far...this one included. It would've been nice to know this (labelling? Hello!) before I bought it.
2,Killing the goose that laid the golden egg,"Maybe there's a reason why Judge would want to release a chopped-up, partial collection of B & B, but whatever it is, it escapes me.When you really want something, like I've wanted complete, unedited season-releases of Beavis & Butthead, you're willing to pay damn near anything within reason.Guess I'll try to get one of the Time/Life releases used or something, if nothing else better comes along. If they ever release the series into syndication I guess we could record the episodes. Frankly, I'd much rather just pay for DVD's.It's funny how some business people think they know what customers want more than the customers do. They are exactly the kind of people we read about in old stories like the one about ""Killing the Goose that Laid Golden Eggs"".Any business person who is that allergic to money needs to go live in the jungle."
1,Spread the word!,"Just adding another bad review to keep the rating low. Censorship of Beavis and Butthead makes no sense! These were supposed to be off the wall and nuts. It's silly to think back in 1993 a 10 year old could've turned on MTV and watched them unedited, but now a 27 year old man like myself can't buy the same show I watched even if I wanted to. You stink Mr. Judge, I'm not buying your King of the Hill just because of this garbage."
4,great but...,"My hubby loves these boots !Plus they arrived to my place the next day (which being that it's the holidays, is great !), however, they never sent me a tracking # so I couldn't see the package's progress. Also, when I lifted the box, the stuff was moving around inside ! Lo and behold I find out, they didn't package it properly (no bubble wrap, paper, foam- nothing) and as a result the boxes got banged up and one of the boots was hanging out of the box ! But, good product though."
3,Its just ok,My baby red slider turtle seems doesn't like it. Its made by several good materials combined but its too dry for him and he more interested in dry gammarus instead of those pallets
4,If the South won Gettysburg,"I liked it because it had a happy ending, unlike the actual historical event."
4,served the purpose,"I speak only very basic German. Got this for a 2 week trip and planned to leave it w/ my daughter who is studying there this semester. I found it generally helpful; she is an intermediate-level German speaker and wasn't nearly as impressed. It's main positives are that it is small and fits easily into your purse, but is substantial enough that it had nearly every word I needed. My main challenge (and I suspect the reason for my daughter's disdain) was that it didn't include common slang. It also wasn't nearly as helpful in Bavaria. Overall, though, I'd recommend it for anyone traveling who needs a more comprehensive, but very portable, dictionary."
5,Ein Buch auf Deutsch,"I like the German language because it is easy to pronunce and I think this book is very good for people who want to learn how to speak German and English fluently, like me."
4,A very obscure collection-,"Wow- asied from Tom Jones and the Small Faces these are one hit blunders. Actually, they didn't even chart. Just played to the max in mod haunts of the 60s. See the Motown influences and how they lead to the Jam and even down the road further to Inspirla Carpets and The Stone Roses. ""Lovingly Yours"" could be a 70s sit-com theme. The problem with these songs is the flat singing. Amen Corner is the rare exception that comes close to capturing the James Brown feel so many are going for. But the songs!!!!! Tons of re-make material here for the right singer!"
4,A very good reminiscing catalogue.,I grew up during this period in Europe. It was a good dance scene. Fond memories were elicited with the first listen. I will probably listen again someday.
4,Jet Boats,"I was amazed at the lack of publications on this subject, and I live near the Snake and Salmon rivers where jet boats were first used.I didn't get my copy of ""Jet Boats"" untill after I had purchased my own boat so I didn't bother with the first four or five chapters. I started with the information on running white water and reading the river which I found to be disappointingly brief.[Footnote: around here people start out learning to run the river by following the Jet tour boats and hiring off seasion fishing guides.]However, the chapter on learning maneuvering skills was, to me, worth the price of the book. Same again for the chapter on maintenance including, acessories, spare parts, sun glasses (!), and inspections and periodic maintenance.After going back and rereading the whole book I decided that Mike Kirnak did a great job in eighty pages. I can't wait for the sequel."
4,new glass citrus juicer,This citrus juicer is a replacement for and looks just like the one I broke after more than thirty years of service. It is lighter in weight but works the same. I miss the weight of the old one but maybe it's just a matter of getting used to the new.
1,poor engineering,"this is poorly engineered. the cone on the juicer is too low, which make your knuckles hit the side of the juicer and your fingertip get in the juice. it's suppose to accommodate oranges too, but there's no way that would work efficiently, because the cone is so narrow and shallow."
5,"It's a great come for this jam remix. I have the 12"" version",I'm from the old school. Spinning the old lp's and cd's. It's great to listen to some old tunes and give it a Y2K favour. As I could recall that was The Three Degrees in Give it Up. Back late 76 early 1977.It's the hype!!!!
1,A book I did not read!,This book is written by the odd weather fellow at our local CBS station. He is a very strange guy and the thought of reading something he has written has about as much appeal as riding a Greyhound Bus for 8 hours. So I did not read it and I can't offer any opinion.
3,"Good, not great!","My first Hiassen novel and I will read more of his work. This one was a decent first effort, but was not as strong as the works of others. The book starts out a little jumbled and several characters seem to be introduced too quickly. For the majority of the book, the story moves quickly, has several twists and holds one's interest. By the end, however, we're back to a slower pace, bogging down in places and offering a less than satisfactory conclusion. It is a good book, but not at all great!"
4,book review,"This author is new to me, very zany charactors! Was a good read while on South Beach in Miami! Just the ticket!"
4,Death To The Tourist Trade,"A cast of colorful Floridians populate Carl Hiaasen's eco-ode to the tropical state. Brian Keyes is a former reporter now small time private eye. When the chamber of commerce washes up on the beach stuffed in a suitcase, the stage is set for a war on tourism, retirers, and money rich land developers. This is one author that can make you laugh hysterically while making you cringe at the violence at the same time. To me it wasn't as good as 'Skinny Dip' which was the first thing of his I read, but it's equally as fun and inventive."
5,Excellent,Very good book. The book even with the murders is still very funny. It also has some very sexy romantic scenes. Carl Hiaasen is a very talented author. A must read!
4,"A little darker than usual, but still good for some laughs","This is the third Carl Hiaasen book that I have read, and it stays pretty close to his usual formula of an unlikely hero trying to save Florida from some dangerously wacky criminals. It's an entertaining read with plenty of vintage Hiaasen humor predicated on the plausible lunacy of the Floridian race. The subject of the rape of the Everglades is pretty close to his heart, and the subtext of the book seems a little angrier than the others that I have read. In this book, he seems to have a lot of sympathy for the villain because he is murdering tourists and that's actually kind of OK. I did enjoy the book overall, and would recommend it to anyone who has never read one of Hiaasen's books, albeit not as strongly as Skin Tight or Stormy Weather."
5,Florida the way it should be (and is),"Stretch your eyes, brain, and especially your fingers, because Tourist Season starts off like a mystery and ends like an action thriller, and that means you won't be putting it down. The only thing this book lacks is a version for those who can't handle the way Carl Hiaasen gets into human nature's ugly side with characters and plot lines so bizarre, they're almost realistic. This roller coaster takes a while to climb the hill, but that makes the rest of the ride all the better. And even if you've never been to Miami, Hiaasen's occasional denouncing of Floridian ways will make you laugh, and make you think."
4,"Great book, but lousy Kindle edition","Typically excellent Hiaasen, but this was obviously an OCR scan of a physical book that no one bothered to proofread. Come on - for the price of this edition you couldn't afford a proofreader? I'd have done it for a freebie. Isn't this what mechanical turk is all about? Garcfa. 1-95. Repeatedly. Ugh."
4,Slow start fast finish,"Frankly I was bored with this novel for the first four chapters. Eventually I started to understand the story line and it became a can't put down type of novel. The main idea of the novel is that tourists and those who go from tourist to homeowners can inspire real estate people to wreck havoc on the environment as they try to make a fast buck. The villians in this novel are basically people who want to protect nature from those who want to destroy it. Their solutions, are what makes this an interesting book. Who are the real villians in this story might make you expend some extra brain power, but it is worth the effortR HemingwayPast Twilight"
4,Doesn't get a whole lot better than Mr. Hiaasen for humor/wit and crazy antics.,"If your looking for something that'll put a smile on your face, Hiaasen is your man. His novels are delightful and I recommend them all."
5,Another great beach read,"Although this is one of Carl Hiaasen's earlier novel, it is still good beach reading. Carl is very in touch with his native Florida and portrays his experiences and mysteries into a hard to put down book."
4,"very funny, my kind of oddball humour","Having found this book under the seat of my car after lending it to a friend for 2 years, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Not knowing if it was supposed to be funny or not caught me off guard when I found myself laughing at loud at one of the early ""terrorist"" victims having been choked to death on a toy rubber alligator. I was hooked! There is a wide range of characters in this story, none of whom go unexplained, and all have seemingly justifiable causes to support. The ""terrorists"" are a diverse group of whackos led by newspaper reporter and ecologist Skip Wiley. He is truly the craziest of the bunch, but there was a part of me that towards the end sympathized with his cause. PI Brian Keyes is a great character that I hope will turn up in his subsequent books, which I plan to obtain as soon as I can get ahold of them. A great read."
4,it aint shakespeare,"hey look, this isnt shakespeare or dickens... it's hiassen! you read it on the beach in florida or whereever. its not meant to be this mind altering literature. its fun and easy! i read it after i finished the biography of john adams when i needed a break. carl hiassen, elmore leonard, dave barry, etc., are all south florida guys, they write like that! fun and relaxed... get it!"
5,Travis McGee without the guilt.,"This fall-on-the-floor-laughing novel was the inspiration for Jimmy Buffett's song, ""The Ballad of Skip Wiley"".The hero and his unlikely band of ecological terrorists try to free Florida from the impact on all the people streaming into the state.Dead-on stereotypes, pranks, humor and just a little bit of an edge. Enjoy"
4,OFFBEAT NOT FUNNY,"I bought this book because it was supposed to be funny. I didn't find it funny at all. It was different and not bad--had a better plot than all the Grisham and Turow novels. Sure, the characters were offbeat--this isn't your usual mystery, but funny? No way. But then maybe I'm just missing the point. I think men would appreciate this author's style more than women would."
2,one of the most disappointing books I've read in a while,"I'm not a great fan of detective fiction, but after reading all the rave reviews hereand elsewhere, I decided to give this one a shot. I was expecting something onpar with the ""Confederacy of Dunces"", but this book left me pretty disappointed.I understand that it was a satire, but everything just seemed so forced, and noneof it was particularly funny. I did make it through, but I should probably justhave given up after the first 20 pages."
4,if you like elmore leonard...,"If you like Elmore Leonard, give this book a try. I read it on an airplane and found it quite enjoyable."
3,Tourist Season,"I had read 3 or 4 of his in a row and the characters, while amusing, get a little eccentric. Especially the crocodille!"
1,Tourist Season,"I don't know how this book managed to get a 4-1/2 star review which is why I bought it. After seeing an interview with Carl Hiaasen I decided to try his books, starting with his first one. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. Hanging the psychiatrist out a window by his feet is too incredible to believe (I had to reread the paragraph to be sure that's what was happening), but then locking the door on a hospital room and having sex in the room while recovering from surgery was the last straw. After reading 190 pages I finally spared myself the torture of finishing the book. It found it's way to the trash can. Don't waste your time on this!"
1,BEWARE not a new book,"This is sold as a new book, but it is a remainder with a big black mark on the bottom of the book. Beware if you were thinking of giving this as a gift!"
1,Too Gory to be Funny,"I am a fan of this author and have read several of his books, but this one is just too bloody and violent to be funny. Too many people are killed in senseless fashion. The idea behind the book is solid--too many people and development is ruining South Florida. But the approach is just too bad. I recommend readers choose his other works instead."
2,Not one of my favorite Hiaasen,"I am a Hiaasen fan, but this was too angry for my tastes. The trademark Hiaasen humor just wasn't there. Maybe I just missed Skink!"
3,A question,"I have looked at all the Disney singalongs available and read all the reviews, and not ONE of them lists the songs performed, anywhere. Who would buy a music DVD with no idea what songs are on it? I wouldn't, and won't.Amazon, bad job."
4,A time to remember & fun,"Good purchase, excellent balance price / value, we enjoyed a lot with my 3 years grand daugther, a choice to learn english words having fun, at the same time you can go back in time, I recommend it. CG"
3,"So-so, says the toddler","Our two year old LOVES the Lion King Sing a long, but really doesn't care for this one. It just doesn't interest him. I gave it three stars because I thought it was OK, I always liked Mary Poppins, but I think the lack of animation in several of the songs is probably not as exciting for the kiddos."
1,did not arrive yet,hiIt is incredible an item that was bought 1 month ago and did not arrive yet. If it was a site that do not not charge youa lot of money for a shipping of a dvd i would have closed one eye but one month to be delivered it is incredible
3,Good but not the best,"I bought this singalong because I had previously purchased another Disney singalong which my son loved. Though this captures more memorable Disney songs, it seemed to not capture my sons attention as did some of the other singalongs."
5,Awesome in Its Simplicity,"This is a tremendous book for anybody wanting in-depth information on geography and warfare but who does not have the technical background of a geographer or military analyst. It is full of excellent, high-quality photographs, and three-dimensional drawings that supplement the text in an excellent fashion. Maps are drawn, not reproduced from older texts, and the clarity and detail is beyond reproach. Chapters are organized by subject matter and the book even contains simplified explanations of satellite reconaisance and outer space applications. This is an excellent book."
3,"Good, but not great, some interesting sections","Some of the chapters (esp. of physical geography + tides + winds) were interesting, making me aware of things I never thought about before.But a fair amount of the book was just average, almost filler, and added little to my knowledge.Overall, the book is worth reading."
3,An okay recording...,"For the price, you really can't find a real deal... but in a lot of places, it's obvious why the price is as low as it is. First of all, the recording is awfully muddy and the piano's tone suffers as a result, often sounding more like it's underwater than anything else.The second thing is that the pianist makes a fair amount of mistakes in the music he is playing, some of them often grating, something that is unacceptable in a studio recording. But I'm still giving it a middle-of-the-road score because the performances aside from the mistakes are often quite good."
3,very poor sound quality almost ruins it,"This is no doubt to me great piano music played by a great performer. I can't find anything wrong with that. The only problem is the recording quality is very poor, almost intolerable at times. This was recorded in the early through late 70s. I disagree with the previous reviewer, the sound isn't crisp or clear at all, it's very staticy and recorded at a very low volume so you have to crank up the volume creating more static. It's also hard to hear how beautiful the piano really is. To confirm what one of the other reviewers said it does sound as if the piano is underwater. Too bad the recording was not cleaned up to sound at least a little better.Even at the price I paid ($25)it still may be over priced. It is a great way to get all of his solo piano music but if you want quality skip this and spend the extra money."
5,PERFECT!,"At first, I thought this product was ridiculously expensive for a sheet of plastic. Then I read the reviews and was impressed. Finally, I attempted to place the included screen protector that came with my TX and had to rip it off moments later (high friction, tons of bubbling, arghh!!!!).Application is critical. Take your time, make sure the screen is clean and dust free (compressed air is your friend). Place this protector down to fit two sides and trust that it is sized perfectly. You want the middle to contact first. Then work the included applicator card to squeeze out any bubbles out the side.As previous reviews mentioned, this is the screen protector to get! It's surface is slick making it easy to pen. Sensitivity is maintained and it appears to be very durable. I think ordering just one is all you will ever need."
2,shipping issues,order this from their website. shipping there costs $2.50 instead of $45 like Boxwave charges here. Apparently this very small piece of plastic comes in a 3 lb box!
3,Does the job,"As other reviewers noted, it does scratch over time. After a year and a half of heavy use, the area over the Graffiti input spot was heavily scratched. This did not impact the accuracy of text input, but was annoying. The accuracy of text input didn't improve over no screen protector. When the scratched spot got irritating, I simply removed the screen protector, turned it 180 degrees, and stuck it on again. The scratched area didn't obscure the screen and was no longer in the Graffiti text input spot."
4,"Long Lasting, Clear Screen Protection","I bought this after reading its reviews and am glad I did. Previously, I'd owned the cheaper varieties that come 2 to 3 to a pack. After a few months of use, the cheaper ones were all scratched up in the writing area -- which made letter recognition difficult for my Palm.The Clear Touch has been on my Palm for ages -- maybe 2 years -- and is still going strong. I did gouge the Clear Touch early on, but that's the only visible blemish. This thing is not indestructible, merely ""very tough"", which is good enough for me."
1,Worthless for Palm TX but useful elsewhere,Fit the Palm TX screen perfectly and easy to install. Unfortunately made the touch screen so insensitive the Palm would not input from the screen at all. Makes it totally worthless for your Palm. I salvaged it by cutting it to fit as a protective cover for a digital camera's LCD display so didn't waste my money altogether.
2,Not really impressed,I really didn't think this was any better than the cheaper ones and I personally thought it was hard to put on. I don't have good finger dexterity though and that may have caused some of the problem but the palm ones were easier to use.
1,I was greatly disappointed,"This product was not at all what I was expecting. I guess I did not read the description very well but I was expecting to get a dozen screen protectors but that's not the case, you get 1. Once I got this on it was too thick for my touch screen to work properly. I threw it out and ordered another product. Buyer Beware."
1,will be good if they sent the right one,After my purchasement suffer a good delay on it's delivery finally recieve the item.I give it to a grandson from México that comes to visit for his palm TX but when he unwrap his gift he noticed that the size is for smaller palms.He can't use it cause it doesn't cover all the area of the palm. Now he's purchasing one cover on his country.I know that delivery can happen but skip checking the products that send is really really dissapointing
1,OVER-PRICED,Too much money.I tried to put it on my palm and I messed it up badly...Make sure you know how to apply the darn thing...one little finger-print or a few air bubbles and it looks bad!!!!Costly mistake for me...now my palm screen goes 'ah-naturale'....a little organic based cleaner...and the screen looks great.
1,Terrible customer service,"mine came defective. customer support solution was for me to send it back. Shipping both ways [one way to get, one way to return] was as much as the product! Screw them!"

5,What Happens When God Answers Prayer,Excellent book - it's a take your time and soak it all in.Highly recommend for all you prayer warriors out there.
5,This is the one to own,"I was shocked when I first heard this performance of the Brahms Bb major. I had been buying recordings of the piece like they were going out of style but when I heard Richter/Leinsdorf/CSO, it was like I was finally hearing the piece the way that I heard it inside my head. For starters, Richter is ridiculous. His chops are way above anything I have every heard from anyone else and his sound puts his vaunted colleague Gilels to shame. Leinsdorf brings an incredible sheen to the orchestra and balance that delivers a nearly perfect performance. And, of course, the CSO just can't be outplayed PERIOD. THIS is the one to own."
3,Not as great as it deserves to be,"I feel Richter plays too fast in the opening movement. The beauty of the piece is lost for me. I do want passion and power in my Brahms but not at break-neck speed. This fastness in playing results in loss of expression and depth. Richter expressed this towards the end of his life. For me, the ideal version of Brahms no. 2 is Backhaus and Bohm on Decca Legends (1967) - listen to the glorious sound of the Bosendorfer piano on that one. oh wow! Listen to the gorgeous slow andante 3rd movement with cello. Bohm's accompaniment is phenomenal and the balance between piano and orchestra is golden. I never tire of that one."
2,"Muddy sound, performance not for everyone","The recording captures way too much hall ambiance and too little piano, resulting in a smeared and muddy sound. Musical line gets lost in the mix in the Scriabin, both because of the sound quality, and because of the rushed tempi. Just because one can play a piece fast doesn't necessarily mean one should. In my opinion, many of the pieces lose something by being just a bit too frenetic and rushed. The other recording of the Scriabin with which I am familiar is by Ruth Laredo on vinyl. Laredo's performances are wonderful and vastly preferable in my opinion, and her recorded piano sound is superb. Deyanova's Shostakovich fares much better. The tempi seem more appropriate and the music less smeared by excessive pedal and hall ambiance. I suspect there are other recordings of the Shostakovich preludes which may be just as satisfying, but these deserve a listen if you are not familiar with them."
5,Heavy Duty,"This sander is terrific and a great value. I find Ingersol Rand products to be great in general and this 8"" sander is no exception."
4,"great filter, tight fit","I've used K&N filters in my other cars for 7 years. THis filter has the same great construction but was a very tight fit in the factory air box. It was difficult to install (15 minutes) but having a nice, tight fit is good for ensuring the air only goes through the filter. The trick to installing is to reach behind and underneath to get a good fit on the bottom of the stock enclosure and then the sides and top align and close very nicely."
1,Does not fit Porsche 911,"Contrary to what AMAZON states this product does not fit a 911. Lower fitting is too thin, but you do not find until old one is off.Don't waste your money and don't believe AMAZON when it comes to what fits."
2,No drywall anchors?,"Ordered 2 of these to match 1 I'd already bought at Lowe's (they they no longer carried when I went back later) and they came with stud screws but no drywall anchors. The one from Lowe's came with a full set of hardware! Additionally, removing the packaging staples from the back of the coat rail splintered some of the material, making it difficult to mount them flush to the wall. Overall, cheap, but what do you expect for that price."
3,Great season,"I like so much this season, show us a very vulnerable Tyson because he lose her teem.Apears a new kid in town, a very interesting kid, Daichi."
4,A difficult but helpful book,"Don't let the size of this book fool you. It may be small but it is extremely heavy. Dr. Pestana leaves no question unexplored as he unpacks the philosophical tension between the categories of moral virtue as opposed to mental health. Dr. Pestana plumbs the depths of each category giving the history of the switch to the prevalent modern preference for the category of mental health. Along the way he makes the arguement that the two categories are not congruent and therefore different. I found this book to be a compelling arguement for the need to retain the concept of moral virtue as a distinct, subjective and useful category in a culture where the objective category of mental health predominates."

5,For Writers Who Need Motivation,"If you're a writer and you're having trouble being motivated, focused or being interrupted by selfish people who don't take your writing time seriously, this is the book for you. If you want examples of two writers who take their writing seriously and puts it first, then read this book. It's a page turner, I've read it several times, and the movie, very ironically starring Snoop Dog, is just as good.Katie"
1,"Not good, not good.",This book is not good. The author's style is good but the story goes nowhere.The characters in the book are really more parodies of people rather than being fully developed.Waste of time.
2,"Walker to Another Book, Stalker is Not Worth a Look","This is the story of a college girl named Lily who volunteers for the midnight shift at a low budget public radio station that has few listeners. Her voice attracts interest from someone who is actually listening and becomes obsessed, but is disappointed the real thing doesn't match what had been imagined by the voice. This stalker decides to have some fun and teach Lily a lesson for being so misleading and ungrateful for the celebrity status the stalker has generously given her by the stalking actions.I thought this book was pretty average. No literary events occur within that are memorable. Look elsewhere for a quality stalking novel."
4,An Arcadian's Companion,"I found this book very fun to read for the price I paid for it. There were several classic arcade games mentioned in the book, each described in enthusiastic detail. The author was very biased about the games that were chosen, but I don't think that it detracted from any of the nostalgicness. I couldn't help but smile at every page I turned to. There were many ""Oh I remember this!"" moments as I read. It has also become a conversational piece wherever I lay it down.I have only two complaints:1.)It would have been nice to have more arcade games to reminisce over.2.)Some arcade games mentioned never showed the pictures of the actual cabinets. Of those, screenshots of the games were given, but I wanted to see the cabinet art work more than screenshots of the games.Overall, a great read and a great conversational piece to add to your rec room or classroom (if you are a teacher like me)."
3,Buy it for the pictures....,"...not the writing. ""Arcade Fever"" is a great visual trip down memory lane, but the writing is at best glib and at worst grammatically incorrect - try parsing this sentence, from page 65: ""While Atari design legend Ed Logg (Asteroids, Gaiuntlet) for Centipede's emasculating action, imagine what the game would have looked like without that serene mushroom patch"". A little more editing might have been in order.If you were in the arcades when these great machines were new you probably won't learn anything from this book - but the pictures (and there are plenty of them!) will bring back some gwonderful memories."
2,Disappointing Flashback - A Quick Review,PROS: Enjoyed cabinet photos and art. Hit most major arcade games of the era. Contained interesting side notes on some games. Interviews were okay but more interesting subject matter could have been included. Some game memorabilia shown from the time was nice.CONS: Lacked enough interesting content to be worth it for me. Did not understand the author's potty-mouth descriptions and lame jokes in the book. - a major negative. Too much irrelevant filler text that could have been used for more info on the games. Did not include notable people who you would expect to be mentioned. Book was printed in China.FINAL CALL: Worth flipping thru twice or for a much-too-shallow overview. Those wanting to remember the era and arcade freaks should look elsewhere.
3,Rather personal book,"I am not sure who the audience is for this book. It is not technical or detailed enough for arcade collectors, and its not really a broad enough overview for casual fans. ""Fan's guide"" is in the title and that is what it is. It's full of personal opinions (some are a bit idiosyncratic) and many of the classics are not covered. That said, its not bad. The author's enthusiasm comes through on every page, and it feels more like a conversation with an enthusiast than a reference text. If that is what you are looking for, then you will likely enjoy."
4,Good picture book!,"Don't agree with John Sellers on all things, but book really has a way of sparking memorys of the past."
2,Not the JHC I remember,"Had read and loved JHC as a teenager, so decided to relive my youth. Disappointing, but may be I will try another of his books before deciding completely. Characters not fleshed out, suspense not great."

3,Not very dolphin-y,"Its an ok CD, good for the price, but not very dolphin-y, especially for being titled ""Dolphin Dance.""Get something else if you are really looking for dolphin music."
4,"Insightful, Uplifting, Informative; A Must Have","From ""Writer to Writer"" helped me immeasurably to focus on from whence comes ""my"" talent; why I want to write, & how to minimize the negatives.As one of my first reference tools from the standpoint of another (successful writer, wife, friend, & child of God), I was so encourged in spite of a writer's challenges.So enjoyable to read you stay in a wonderful flow, get x-cited to pick up your pencil, go to the puter, and begin. Yet, pearls of professional wisdom abound in this book.Treat yourself... Place it on your desk or night stand & refer, refer, refer."
4,Great read on American slavery,"Loved the book. I am a big fan of 18th and early 19th century American history. Recently I have been reading books on slavery during this time period.I would have loved to have read a little more about Robert Carter III of Westmoreland County, VA other then the one sentence on page 77. This man, a founding father,freed nearly 500 slaves with his Deed Of Gift during his lifetime. With the one sentence on Carter the authour disrespects this founding father by failing to give a brief outline of Carter and the manumission of his slaves.If you enjoyed Rough Crossings and thirst for knowledge of slavery in colonial America and then later during the early years of the US you should check out The First Emancipator: The Forgotten Story of Robert Carter, the Founding Father who freed his slaves by Andrew Levy. This is a excellant book and it does a great service to the forgotten story of Carter and his life."
4,Great Book,This was an excellent scholarly piece. It was instrumental in my discussion for my politics of revolutionary thought course. It is an excellent spring board to challenge students to find out more about the roles of African Americans during the American Revolutionary War.
4,Narrative history from an unabashedly moral viewpoint,"Schama unabashedly, and provocatively, studies the past from a moral viewpoint. In Citizens, he lengthily propounds the thesis that the French Revolution's violence was inherent from the very start and was not a perversion brought about by Jacobin terror. In this book, he seeks to introduce a discordant note in the traditional narratives of the American Revolution: Yes, it was a step forward in the story of freedom, but, no, it was a step back for American slaves who rushed to British lines after the redcoats offered freedom in exchange for serving George III. A remarkable story that led some men and women from Africa, to the American colonies, to Nova Scotia, and finally to Sierra Leone told in an unapologetically literary style."
3,Small Planks,"I bought these as gifts for my brother-in-laws. I missed the part about ""single serving"" size so they are 1/2-1/3 the size of a normal blank. I am not sure yet how they will hold up to multiple uses. Overall they were well received."
4,Snuggle Safe Fleece Cover,Excellent product. This is the second one I have purchased. Good quality and quick delivery.
3,OK,"OK - but a heating pad worked better for my litter - easier to get onto - and more consistently warm. I was glad to have the Snuggle Safe just in case I needed to take the litter to the vets (or a puppy to the vets) in an emergency. Fortunately, we had no need for an emergency vet visit - The Snuggle Safe was just so rigid that it wasn't inviting."
1,Warning!! please read,"I have had pet snuggles for years. Recently an older one leaked some of the gel - no big deal. Bought another one. I have small inside dogs so have never heated to the maximum times. After the new one arrived, without my realizing it, It leaked. However, this time the fluid was hot and lit the blanket and pet bed into a smoldering dangerous mix. I smelled something that I thought was an electrical problem in the house. i was panicked. My eyes started burning and then I saw one of the dogs shaking. Her bed was so hot it was smoking, the plastic casing was burning. Very dangerous situation. PLEASE DO NOT USE when you are not at home. If I hadn't been home over the holiday, my dogs and home would be gone!!"
4,Good Product,I work at as a preschool teacher and this is what I was looking for in the ABC's cards for my bulletin board. I only hoped that the number cards were the same as the ABC'S (seperated) but that's ok it still works for the purpose.
4,Who is really responsible?,"It amazes me that with all the controversy about this book, that there is never any comment on his charges about who bears responsibility for the towers falling. He makes it clear that there was corruption during the building of the WTC. That very serious short cuts were taken in the construction. And that lead to the buildings being far less sturdy than the law and common sense required.Had the proper materials been used, the buildings would not have collapsed. There would still be terrible devastation where the planes hit. But the buildings should have been able to withstand that damage. And thousands of people would have lived."
4,Good overview of the WTC story - some photos would help,"I found the first half of this book a fascinating and detailed account of the 9/11 World Trade Center tragedy and its immediate aftermath. The book takes you many places the news accounts didn't, and reveals some pretty amazing facts (e.g., there were actually people inside the buildings who survived the collapse). The second half, where he delves into the bureaucracy surrounding the demolition and recovery efforts is interesting but less dramatic.The book has one serious flaw though - other than a crude map of the site inside the cover, there are no photographs or illustrations at all. Even just a ten-page insert with some photos of the key people and places he describes would be a huge improvement. Trying to tell a story of this magnitude with text alone is a noble effort, but it falls short."
1,National Enquirer-esque,"This book has been completely discredited piece by piece.wtclivinghistory.orgHonestly, I don't know how Langewiesche lives with himself."
1,Money wasted,Austrians beware. This product is not compatible with you DVD player as it does not use PAL!
2,Oldies not as good as remembered,"My daughter loves the Circle of Life sing along video so I thought this one would be great as well. This video contains more of the older Disney songs and I didn't realize until now how many stereotypes there were. Some songs are great (Bare Necessities and I Wanna Be Like You), others just so-so and some just unwatchable. Old Yeller fighting a black bear for 3/4 of the song was more than my 2-year old wanted to see. She much prefers to keep watching Disney's other video: Circle of Life.Song List: ""The Bare Necessities"" (The Jungle Book), ""You (Are a Human Animal)"" (""The Mickey Mouse Club""), ""Cinderella Work Song"" (Cinderella), ""Old Yeller"" (Old Yeller), ""Figaro and Cleo"" (""Figaro and Cleo""), ""Winnie the Pooh"" (Winnie the Pooh Featurettes), ""I Wanna Be Like You"" (The Jungle Book), ""Look Out for Mr. Stork"" (Dumbo), ""Ev'rybody Wants To Be a Cat"" (The Aristocats), ""The Ugly Bug Ball"" (Summer Magic), ""The Bare Necessities"" Reprise (The Jungle Book)"
5,The Truth About What Is On The Bare Necessities,"On January 3rd an all new DVD of songs never seen together will be called The Bare Necessities. This edition will be a one disc set. The songs will be The Bare Necessities, The Work Song,Old Yeller, Winnie the Pooh, I Wan'na Be Like You, Look Outfor Mr. Stork, Ev'rybody Wants to be a Cat and The Ugly Bug Ball. Enjoy!"
2,not what i expected,my nephew likes the video but i was expecting more songs from the jungle book. it was disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this video.
5,Those Kooky Bare Necessities!,"I just love to sing to a lot of Disney songs! I have never heard of the Ugly Bug Ball song before, but it has become a very catchy tune to learn from this volume!"
5,No Generation Gap here!,My 3 daughters enjoyed this video many moons ago and now my granddaughter is singing and dancing along! I never grew tired of these adorable songs and lovely old videos. No generation gap here! Original Disney is timeless.
3,One of Rembrandts greatest book,If you are doing a research paper like I am on Rembrandt u will find this book very helpful....it tells u about his life and all of the trouble he goes through and the different paintings he painted it goes into a great detail on just about everything u would need to know about the great painter REMBRANDT!
4,More please!,"I purchased this DVD for myself last Christmas as a gift, hence I did not actually view it until last weekend for the first time. Let me just say THANK YOU! This is a ""darker"" look into the possible beginnings of Santa and I doubt that I am going to let my son watch it until he is a little older, but I personally have missed it.I just wish that WB/Rankin and Bass could come to some kind of agreement and have a full box set of all the stop motion shows."
4,Fun to watch but not as good as the Glen Hill version,"I had first watched the Glen Hill verison(starring the exceptional Robby Benson) and then watched this Rankin and Bass version. I must admit that the first time I watched this one I wasn't too impressed, but that was because the Glen Hill version is a masterpeice in comparison. This one is pretty good though and has the same charm as all of R&B's classic Christmas specials. Those of you who knock it are just knocking yourselves, so don't bother."
2,Rankin and Bass scrape the bottom of the barrel.,"One of the poorest of the Rankin and Bass ""animagic"" films, ""The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus"" suffers from a dull story, weak songs, lack of humor, and frequent breaks in continuity. It has very little of the charm that illuminates the original ""Rudolph"" or ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"", both of which obviously benefited from the input of Romeo Mueller, who did not work on this project. I would only recommend this to collectors that insist on having everything available by Rankin & Bass."
4,Life and Adventures of Sata Claus/Nestor the christmas donkey,"A great double feature for the christmas season, anyone of all ages will enjoy a small tale of begining of santa claus."
5,This is a Classic,This movie will bring out the imagination in everybody. It is fun to watch for kids and adults. Rankin and Bass always create Christmas classics and this one is a must see.
5,Christmas DVD,Really enjoyed this dvd...children loved it but the adults in the room also thought the dvd was awesome. I would recommend this purchase to everyone....
5,my all-time favorites!!!,"Without getting ""technical"": I had to buy this book 2 years ago because I couldn't find the dvd. I was thrilled to find this today and paired with my former favorite, nestor. When I was a kid, my younger sister and I had a VCR tape that we recorded all of the Christmas specials on that year and we watched it over and over and over again until we wore it out and the next year there was no more life and adventures OR nestor. I can't wait to share this with my boys and I can't wait to sing along with life and adventures as I still remember all of the songs---we want to wake up to a BIG SURPRISE....so pumped to get this!!! Best gift to myself this year."
1,Freaky!,"I was watching this the other night and I shook my head and said this is pathetic, and half way through I finally turned the TV off, it was way to freaky and I can't believe this was actually made by Rankin & Bass, They had made some genuine classics but this wasn't one of them and it was totally bizarre to the extreme!"
1,What in the world is this???,"I love most things Rankin and Bass, but this is awfull! It's like a tripped out Dungeons and Dragons fantasy world in which a cheesy story of Santa is told.I can't immagine a child liking this. It stinks. Why was this made? Give me Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" anyday."
1,Caveat Emptor/defective DVD,"I was just as happy as everyone else to find this released on DVD, but was skeptical of the ""DVD-R"" format. Unfortunately when I attempted to play it (in a DVD player, not a PC or DVD reader) the picture froze several times, then proceeded without sound. After wiping the disc off to make sure it wasn't dust, I tried again but the only thing that played before it quit completely was the copyright warning. I'm returning it for a refund."
3,"Good, but not as great as other classics.","I am sure these would be entertaining to young children, but these are not as great as the Christmas classics that I remember watching growing up (such as Charlie Brown, Rudolph, Frosty)."
5,This is one of only three stop motion Christmas classics left to be released,"This movie is a Rankin/Bass classic and should be treated as such. (This is a DVD-R, unrestored version). About two years ago, WB finally released The Leprechaun's Christmas Gold and Pinocchio's Christmas in a boxed set with other Rankin/Bass classics.The only Rankin/Bass stop motion Christmas classics that have not been restored and released on DVD as of today (Dec 11, 2009) are:1. The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus2. The First Christmas (aka The Story of the First Christmas Snow)3. The Little Drummer Boy Book IIAll three are owned by WB. Sooooo, hopefully these three will be released in a new Christmas boxed set - perhaps as early as next year - Christmas 2010!!"
3,Not bad after a long wait,"I had wanted to get a copy of this movie for years, but it was never released on DVD until now. The movie was just as good as I remember it(Life and Adventures of Santa Claus) but, the picture quality wasn't very good. I think Warner Bros. is testing the waters to see if the movie will sell. If it does, they will probably release a cleaned up version in a couple of years. If you can't wait to relive either of these films, order it; otherwise, I wouldn't invest the money in it."
3,The Loveliest Voice,"I am partial to Monday because her voice is so beautiful. I met her once and she is so kind and happy-go-lucky. Not to mention she's one of the most beautiful Japanese women I have ever met. As many of her other albums, she writes and sings about love an relationships and this recording does that well. Its not one of my favourites by her, but if you want to hear lyrics that are poetic, buy this one. In fact, these aren't lyrics. This is poetry with acid jazz in tow. You almost wonder if she is extracting personal sentiments from her journal. Her words seem that genuine. Her rendition of Hancock's Maiden Voyage is so calm and soothing using the flutes and other woodwinds. Listen to this with the one you love."
5,Why is this book out of print?,"I, too, was enthralled by this book as a 10 year old in 6th grade. It is a gripping story that has stuck with me for almost 40 years. I still have my copy, one of the few children's books that I have held onto in my nomadic life. Looking at it, I see that it was first published in the Netherlands in 1954, and then in the UK in 1961. I have a British 1971 edition. I have unsuccessfully looked for copies for my nieces and nephews. I'm hanging onto mine for my own son."
1,Very Badly Made Costume,"My son didn't have this costume on for 5 minutes when one of his shoe covers broke. The velcro completely detached from the back of the shoe. He wasn't running, jumping, or doing anything that might cause it to do so. It's cheaply made and looks so in person. I was so disappointed with the costume."
4,A good reference copy,"Bernard Roberts is what I'd call a ""journeyman pianist"". That's not a negative, its a recognition that he's a master craftsman who can be relied on to give a good interpretation of the works without taking them over. These recordings may feel a bit 'flat' or colorless as a result but it allows you, the listener, to delve a bit deeper into the music rather than the performance. This will be especially important if you are interested in studying or performing these works. (Indispensable accessory is the score, BTW -- also available from Amazon!)"
3,A fistful of Ludwig's piano sonatas for under $30? Yes!,"This is a great deal -- of the bargain disks, Janos Jando on Naxos and Alfredo Perl on Arte Nova have more inspired playing -- but this Nimbus set is 11 disks which is amazing.If there are only three Beethoven sonatas you will ever listen to and you are very cheap, buy the individual Alfredo Perl disks and you will be happy.If you are picky/knowledgeable/snobby about sound and performance, or already have all of LvB's sonatas on various disks, you won't be particularly happy with this set.But, if you want to investigate all of Beethoven's piano sonatas, this is an excellent place to start. And while you are saving up the $100 or so for a big name set, you can be enjoying more than adequate performance & recording (unless you hate reverb -- this is Nimbus after all) of some of the greatest compositions for unaccompanied piano ever written."
5,"Great Music, Great Movie!",I am only 14 but this is definetly one of my favorite movies. The music really pulled me in just like the music from Smokey and the Bandit. This is definetly a pleaser!
3,Smoky and the Bandit go to the Whorehouse,"If you want to blame anyone for the movie- blame Burt and/or the Hollywood suits who, to quote Fobidden Hollywood, ""change all the songs to the writer's alarm/then drag out the pace and all but erase the lyrical charm"". Set your CD player to only play the songs that feature Dolly and remember that there is no bushel big enough to hide her light."
1,Bad movie,"The movie is a bad one - not worth seeing. In some ways the soundtrack is even worse as it merely reminds us of the trend downward Dolly Parton's career began to take in the late 70's when she turned her back on her country roots in favor of light insubstantial Hollywood pop. Of late, she has shown signs of rebounding with her country roots. Forget this pap and stick with her more traditional material."
1,Don't bother.,More muck from the dreadful pop and Hollywood phase of Dolly Parton's career. The title alone to this movie and soundtrack should tell you about the level of artistic achievement it attains but the horrid thing is that the music is even worse than the tittle suggests. Pass.
4,Album was slightly different from the film's songs.,"Being that the movie is one of my all-time favorites, I can pretty easily spot differences and glitches in the music and cinematography (if any). Which is why I've noticed the similarities and differences between the soundtrack album and the film itself. For example, the song ""Little Ol' Bitty Pissant Country Place,"" (in the film) there are only two main verses to the song, but in the album, there are THREE! There is only one explanation that I can think of for this: during editing of the film for theatrical release, the ORIGINAL second verse of the song was decidely cut from the original film's negative."
3,Best part is the last three songs,"""Sidestep"" by Charles Durning is a classic. The song always conjures the image of him strutting around the rotunda of the Texas State capitol singing and dancing. And what a comment on politics and politicians!""Hard Candy Christmas"" is a GORGEOUS song, but I agree with the lead review which suggests the movie version should have been included with this CD instead of Dolly's solo performance. The whole purpose of this song was to illustrate that all the women in that whorehouse had lived a hard life.""I Will Always Love You"" is a gorgeous ballad. It's a little over the top for me, but still one of the best musical performances on the CD.The rest is cute and I'd consider it filler."
5,My favorite musical,"I usually hate musicals. However, I really enjoy the generally fun atmosphere of the movie."
3,Xmas Gift,"I had ordered this as Christmas gift, so I have not had a chance to listen to it.I did receive it here very fast, and it arrived in good continion. other then that, I can not comment on."
4,Interesting articles and a great research resource.,This book is a great resource for anyone doing research on Latter-day Saint women or for anyone simply interested in learning about women and frontier life. All of the articles are insightful and discuss topics that might not be found in the standard history of the LDS church such as mysticism and feminism. There is also extensive writing on polygamy and the effects it had on women in the Church.
4,Therapeutic Music...,"This cd is very soothing either in conjunction with therapy or just by itself.I have bought this cd ten years ago for my office, also six months ago as a gift.Recently I got another again for myself."
1,This book is insulting to one's intelligence,"I was so looking forward to receiving this book as it appeared it would be full of wonderful information and helpful hints, however, I found it to be insulting to one's intellegence. Most everything in it is merly common sense. I believe even a second grader would be bored. Also, the content of the book certainly does not justify the cost. I felt taken advantage of as it is neither helpful or informative, and the size of the book is so small for the price. Not a good investment, and I am very pleased that Amazon.com allows a 30 day return if not satisfied. Thumbs down to this one."
4,Convenient Reference for the Kitchen,"After reading the other reviews for this book I was cautious about buying it but went ahead anyway. I'm glad I did! I've used the book 4 times in the past week. While none of the information is necessarily new and you probably already have the information in your general cookbook, what make this book great is that it is well organized and easy to use. I bought it primarily for the substitution section. Last night I ran out of sour cream for a baking recipe and I referred to it for a substitution (sour milk). I also used it to find out how many teaspoons equal a tablespoon so I could accurately add half a tablespoon (1 1/2 teaspoons). It also has instructions to make seasame oil, which I could have used a couple of weeks ago. I find this to be a handy cooking book that I expect to referred to again and again."
5,Great learning and an uplifting book,"If you know nothing or little about Judaism, this book will give you an outline of our customs and traditions, along with uplifting personal stories. A must have!"
4,Regional Italian Cuisine,"I have tried several of the recipes and they are excellent. I have found that the cooking directions are not always clear and some have errors, but it is an otherwise delightful book."
3,Grinds good but makes a mess,"I've had this grinder for several years. It grinds well - consistant, very wide range of grind sizes. It does, however, make a complete mess of things. As another reviewer says, this machine creates a LOT of static. Grounds go everywhere when removed from the bin. The lid of the bin is also poorly designed. I have to hold the lid down to keep coffee coming out of the grinder from escaping under the lid and spraying my counter. Mine needs some maitenence and rather than fix it, I've decided to try the KitchenAid pro grinder."
3,"Good, but not the best I've had","These are good, but don't have as much of the ""gooey Jam"" center as some of the others I have tasted. Brach's makes a very good strawberry candy, but I cannot always find that brand at my local stores, so this does pretty well."
5,Just Gotta Have It!,"This is the BEST cookbook ever. I have soooo many cookbooks and it seems like this is the only one I ever actually use. Unique recipes, most easy to prepare. My guess is that one of the reasons bed and breakfast inns are so popular is the food... now make it at home too. Buy this book it's great!"
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"This has some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard. ""Reverence"" is one of the best compositions.Pick this up and others in the Atmosphere series. You won't regret it."
3,Average Quality and Performance,"I have been using coal tar products forever for my psoriasis. This one seemed to be weak in the coal car concentration - so although it smelled better than most, I really didn't see much improvement in my skin. If you react well to lighter dosages, or have very slight cases if skin issues - then it might be for you. I will go back to something a little stronger in concentration.On the good side - the price was great and worthy of at least giving it a try!"
1,Didn't help with Psoriasis,"I use liquid Coal Tar for my Psoriasis, and it works pretty well. The soap didn't help at all."
5,coal tar soap,"I like the product, although, in the instructions, it said if my order exceeded a certain amount the shipping was free, and I couldn't get it removed, so the cost was substantially more than I thought. I ordered it This Time anyway. but may shop elsewhere for my next supply.Wilton"
4,"Liked it, but it did not help my Psoriasis as I had hoped.","This bar lasted several months which is something considering I showered to use it often for my Psoriasis. It did not really help that though. Therefore, if you are considering purchasing this for that purpose you may be disappointed. However, it is not expensive and as we do not all react, or not react to things the same it is worth the try."
4,works really well,"This does what it says are far as performance. 68' ford starts a lot easier now, Installation was pretty simple, with 2 exceptions. First (I purchased the Ignitor coil to go with this) older coils have terminals marked ""battery"" and ""ignition"" not ""+ and -"". not that big of an issue, until you go online to make sure you did it right, and find out a lot of people mix up the wires. Second keep the box for reference. Instructions don't have any pictures, Idiot me put the magnetic ring on upside down. It took 20 mins to figure out why the car wouldn't start. Luckily I happened to glance over at the box and saw the picture.Produce it VERY good, instructions should be more idiot proof. Car is running like a champ and I haven't ""fully"" tuned it yet."
4,If.........,"""If I were a rich man.....""! Roger Whittaker at his best. If I were really a rich man, I would ..... buy all his recordings from Amazon!Sound quality is good. However, lyrics in the slip cover would have been an added bonus!ThanksBR"
5,The best of Roger,"Roger Whittaker fans will certainly enjoy this album. I purchased it because of ""The Last Farewell"" a personal favorite."
3,"Definitely not ""the best""...","This is the third Roger Whittaker CD I've bought (This one, 'Greatest Hits', and another I can't recall) trying to get an actual ""greatest hits"" collection, but all three have fallen way short of my expectations. Granted, this CD does have some of his greats (Durham Town, The Last Farewell, Mexican Whistler, New World in the Morning, From Both Sides Now), but most of them are mediocre at best, and I find myself wanting to skip through them to get to the good ones. The album that really introduced me to Roger Whittaker was actually a Reader's Digest release, also titled ""The Very Best of Roger Whittaker"". That's the one I've been trying to find for so long, and it looks like I just did here on Amazon (The Very Best of Roger Whittaker (Reader's Digest)), though it's no longer in production apparently. Though that is largely a cover album, every song is worth listening to, many times in my opinion, unlike many of the ""filler songs"" on this album and others."
5,We like Roger,Having attended several of Rogers concerts in the past we have become dyed in the wool Roger Whitaker fans. We purchased the CD to replace some of the tapes that we have worn out. We play the cd in the car as we do our erands and we love it
1,not the same,Description did not include listing of songs on CD. Contacted Amazon and was told it should have same songs as other CD by same title (18 songs) but that I should contact seller. Wanted quick delivery so I went ahead and ordered. It only had 10 songs vs 18 on other CD by same title. The 10 songs only included 3 of my favorites so I will have to order at least one more CD. I kept it since quality is supposed to be better than others - haven't ordered the other one(s) yet so I can't compare. Low score is based strictly on lack of adequate description.
5,A Blessed Voice,"This Voice transends reviews. I have listened to him for almost forty years. I can remember the disc jockeys initial introduction of his records,"" The most Captivating Voice of our Times"" It was true then and it is true now."
4,Bought as a gift,"I bought this as a gift. The person really likes the way it looks and works, but I guess it runs out of butane rather quickly."
1,boring,"I found myself reading this book as fast as I could, not because I couldn't wait to see what happened, but because I wanted it to END. It was slightly painful, to be honest. The strory line is convoluted and incongrous. I bought it, to be truthful, bc of the cover, and because I thought it would be more of an Erotica book than a novel. Even though the sexual scenes were good, the rest was just plainly awful. And there is a lot of the rest. I could not identify with any of the characters, and did not feel anything, not even a little bit of pity, for any of them (well, except Juan, the Illegal Mexican, he was better developed through most of the book, but hardly likeable by the end)."
3,What some guys won't do for a buck!,"Well, this is my third Ben Tyler novel. I previously read ""Tricks of the Trade"" and ""Hunk House."" This was my least favorite of the three. A very trite story, (the sex was good) but not good enough. I really thought I was going to read about some very ""hot"" sex, but it was more like reading an article in a gay version of Cosmopolitan Magazine. Tyler is a good writer, one of the better ones of this genre. I have sitting on my shelf ""Gay Blades"" and will read that in hopes that it is on par with his earlier work. I did like however, the relationship in this novel between Derek and Juan. This is far from the best gay novel I have ever read, but if you're looking for some ""good"" sex with a somewhat interesting story line attached, this should do it for you.Guy De RosaLos Angeles, California"
4,Great casual read,"If you are looking for a well-written, interesting novel, that you will enjoy reading, this is it. If you are looking for classic literature, try something else. Many people can relate to the desperation in the novel, but very few entertain the choices made in the book. There are some twists and turns, and everything isn't as it originally appears, and that keeps the story interesting. Good beach reading, even in the dead of winter. I've read other Ben Tyler novels, and I look forward to reading more of them."
3,Review of One Night Stand,"The story line is trite. The characters are somewhat unrealistic and overly romanticized. Everything falls too conveniently into place and that's not life! The story is initially entertaining, but soon bogs down into cliches and basically boring characters. Apart from this, the book is mildly entertaining."
4,Good light hearted reading,"I enjoy Mr. Tyler's books and have read them all. This book had a very good story. The sex is very explicit, but doesn't necessarily distract from the story. He typically includes a lot of man-on-man sex in his books (typically of the same type, beautiful bodies, well endowed, etc. gets a bit boring)."
3,Not the best for Ben Tyler,This is a story around two waiters that are out of work when the diner closes. They struggle to get work but get laid more in the process. They get tangled up with powerful men of Hollywood. The book did have its moments but I have read better books by Ben Tyler. I do not feel I wasted my money on the book but just go into the book knowing that Ben Tyler has much better works out there.
2,"A summer diversion, but not much more","One Night Stand is the first book I have read by Ben Tyler and I can't say that I was particularly impressed. Since the Publisher's Weekly review calls it ""Tyler's best novel yet"" I probably won't be reading any more by Mr. Tyler. To begin with, the book is in serious need of proofreading. There were enough errors, in both grammar and continuity, that they actually became distracting. More importantly, the writing is about as deep as a wading pool and has as much style as, well, something without a lot of style. It consists of very basic and concrete descriptions of what people look like, what they are doing, and where they are doing it. Lack of style is definitely this book's major downfall. The story is pure soap opera, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if that's what you are looking for. Personally, I found myself rolling my eyes too often to even call the book a guilty pleasure. The best I can say is that it is a not altogether unpleasant diversion."
2,Did not like.,I did not like this book. It started out good. Some where in the middle it changed. I didn't like it at all. NO good.
2,Slow,"This is a rather uninspired book. I found the story line very familiar due to the fact that I think I have seen it in a number of other books. The cast of characters was very small (at least the ones the author spent time on), and they were a bit boring. The one positive was the correctness in the details of the tradecraft used. Why did I finish it? My mother bought it for me at a garage sale and I felt obligated."
5,Great book!!,"He's my former commander 2Bn, 10th SFG(A)so I must buy and support his book. Go get them Ranger Grange"
5,Works great,"I left a paint pan in my kitchen sink overnight and the metal reacted with the stainless steel sink, leaving a dark stain. I used the Autosol metal cleaner to clean it up and now my sink is like new again."
2,Disapointed,"When ordering this product, i was under the impression there were 3 floats per package as shown in the picture.You can purchase this item at Walmart for far less."
4,Love it!,"Excellent! Not Dragonball z, but pretty damn good for a show which had almost nothing to do with the creator of dragon ball besides the character designs."
1,"I'm sorry to all fans, but GT sucks","story sucks, action sucks, SSJ 4 looks weird, it made me so disappointed watching GT that Akira Toriyama didn't make a good sequel to DBZ. Well, too late."
4,Worth it for the pictures!,"In addition to this being a wonderful tome for the coffee table with its numerous color photographs, Baron's Encyclopedia is filled with useful information for the prospective owner trying to decide on a breed. There are paragraphs on temperament and health concerns (excluding cancer), but the most immediately useful feature is the five-point rating of characteristics such as trainability, affection, watchdog ability, grooming issues, etc. Dog lovers will want to own this book."
3,"OK, but not thorough.","The book is well done and well-photographed. Howewver, I manage volunteers that help hospice patients who have dogs (in home). I need to know the different breeds. The first two I looked up, Schnauzer and Yorkie, were not in the book! Disappointing since these are common breeds."
5,Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds,"A wonderful book! One of the best dog books I've ever seen!! There are beautiful photos of each breed, and there are over 150 AKC recongnized breeds in the book! The author could have added more breeds, but the book only includes AKC breeds, so doing so would have been giving false info. There are two pages for each breed, so plenty of information is givin. There is a chart for each breed which includes Playfulness, Affection level, Cold tolerance, etc. Sections of the text are History, Temperment, Upkeep, Health and Form & Function. You can learn a lot just by reading a few pages in this book! The pictures show the dogs in all different positions, not just in show position, and in a variety of the breed's colors. The backgrounds resemble the dog's function (ex. Belgian Tervuren has a background that includes sheep) This is a great book! 5 stars!"
5,Excellent review of all breeds in an easy format .,"This book as with all her others reach out to the novice. It makes the novice knowledgeable in making choices as to what breed they may like. It is well done yet not so technical that it is over your head. Felt pictures were the weakest point although the reproduction was very good. Some of the pictures were not of the best examples of their breed. I have found the book to be very useful in gathering information about different breeds, and what to expect from them. As a member of several Kennel Clubs, this book has been a big hit at meetings for the old timers as well as the new members. I highly recommend it for all."
5,Great Book,"This book was a former libray book. It is in great shape and very informative. Delivery was prompt, and the price was right!"
4,Good Book!,"Great book, but a bit expensive. However, hard cover and very well compiled. Has all the dog breeds and lots of good information."
5,The Ideal Resource Book,"This is a fantastic resource book on different breeds of dog. The descriptions are thorough, easy to read and are accompanied by color photos. Dogs are rated on energy level, exercise requirements, playfulness, affection level, friendliness towards dogs/other pets/strangers, ease of training, watchdog ability, protection ability, grooming requirements and tolerance toward cold and heat. I was able to really determine the best dog for my family using measures I hadn't even thought of! This book is the one for you if you are trying to decide the best purebred dog for your family and lifestyle. Check out ""Hot Dogs"" for excellent info on some of the newer mixed breeds."
5,Colorful and informative,"This is a great overview of AKC breeds. There are 2 full color photos (not drawings) of the dogs. I refer to this book all the time. It covers the history of the breeds, statistics, temperment,personality, health isuues, and much more. I bought one for me and one for my sister. I highly recommend this book!"
5,One of the best dog breed books,"I had been looking for a book of dog breeds but none quite measured up to what I was wanting. there are many that include lots of information about dogs in general, like health care, training etc. but this made the section on breeds smaller.I like this book because it devotes two pages to each breed mentioned. It provides a pretty good history, good pitures, and a handy ""at a glance"" chart. While I still wish the temperment section would include more info (some breeds only have 2 sentences) it provides more info than any other book I have found.Overall, this is perfect if you just want information on the breeds in an easy style."
5,For dogs lovers,The the book told me lots of new things. I did not know about dogs and that now i know and i love the book.
3,Not quite as billed,"Although item was billed as ""like new,"" back of book had been bent; spine was rather used. Book condition was decent though not new."
4,A dog gone good book!,"As an avid fan of dogs and other things related to general caninery, I have found this book an absolute joy as both a research companion, and a flotation device.I have a mixed breed daschund/pomeranian, and he's quite the fetcher! This book gives him something fantastic to chase, and if and when I choose to stud my dog, I'm sure the nice pictures of bitches in this book will get him ready to reproduce.An excellent read all around."
5,Beautiful book,This is just what I wanted gives me the info that I'm looking forwith good pictures of dogs.
5,Pure Bliss,"I love this album. Such beautiful recordings of such beautiful music. Each song transitions perfectly into the next, until it climaxes at the end. Some of the best choral recordings you'll ever hear."
5,Musical Masterpiece,"Portions of this magnificent work can be heard in the final scene from Angels and Demons-The movie. The Lux Aeterna is to date a modern masterpiece. It will move you imensely as does the Brahams German Requiem-especially the second movement. You will listen to this piece frequently as it is timeless. A must have for any choral requiem collector. As powerful as the Verde Requiem, As stirring as the Brahams, as memorable as the Motzart. I promise."
5,made the best vanilla extract,Made exceptional extract as well as was great scraped and used in fresh baked goods as well. Will be ordering more soon.
2,These are not Tahitian beans,"A friend recently returned from Tahiti & brought some beans from the islands - these beans that I ordered from this company are not even close in quality to the beans I received from my friend.The beans that I purchased here were much, much skinnier, and the husks were dried and shriveled. They were subpar to the Tahitian Vanilla Beans that I had received from Tahiti."
5,EXCELLENT,Ms. Graham keeps getting better and better. I am an avid reader of mystery/romance novels and this one is excellent. The characters are very likeable and the story keeps the reader guessing until the end. I can't wait for her next novel.
1,Picture me.....REALLY disliking this book,"The jacket blurb sounded great, but the book didn't come close to the hype. It's like a bad TV movie that leaves going-to-commercial cliffhangers that turn out to be nothing much. The ending is predictable, and I never got to like any of the characters. I am always let down when a good book ends, but not this time.........read to the end just to validate what I thought would happen.Buy this at a library book sale..........that's where I'm bringing my copy."
3,Greatest hits? yeah right,"How are you gonna have a greatest hits without ""only the strong survive""? and how didnt they include any of his radio mixes from back in the day?????? Greatest hits? Nope, but it's a-ight I guess"
1,Defective product,"I selected this product because it had a CD player, tape player, radio, and was rated by Amazon reviewers as having good sound quality. After receiving it and setting it up, I turned it on. It was set at ""radio."" I looked for obvious means to turn it to CD or tape player, but found none. Then I attempted to turn the player ""off"" and found that the ""on/off"" button would not function. To turn it off, I had to unplug the player. After plugging it back in, I found that the ""on/off button"" would not work at all. Therefore, the player was completely unsuable and I returned it. The player was quite large and bulky and difficult to repack in the box. Obviously, I was very dissatisfied with this product."
4,Excellent boom box,Excellent sound. The only thing it is missing is the usb or SD card slot. I bought a cheap boom box on Amazon and it has both..Sony needs to catch up to the times. Otherwise it operates great.
2,Bad Power Switch,"Bought in March 2011 and only used 2 or 3 times in stationary position (not moving from one location to another). Then just stop working. Thought it was blown internal fuse or something internal. So just left sitting same place, forgotten, until one day decided to try turning on again, and powered right on. But when I turned off, did not come back on. Not impressed with this unit at all. Wasted money until maybe I take it apart and repair the power button related components. Meanwhile, going to try a work radio and see if they actually will work, as this one doesn't."
1,Sony CFDG505 Radio cassette recorder boombox,I have alot of tapes I still love to listen to and it's hard to find a radio/cassette player recorder around these days. I have gone through 3 of these things and each time the cassette button has broken. I returned one and got a replacement and then I just gave up. I was attracted to the sound which was good and the price which was good too but they didn't even last a year.
5,Best boombox I've ever owned,"This is a great box. It has everything I wanted. I even think it looks cool! Everybody else seems to think it's ugly. This is the first good boom box I have owned. In the past I have always bought cheapies from Kmart and such, so I may be a little easy to please. But this seems comparable to good shelf systems I have had in the past. I got this mainly to play my mp3 collection from my laptop. Most of these units have an Ipod dock which is nice but I really need some kind of ""aux in"", which is basically what this one has (1/8"" stereo in). The sound is great. The display is a little small but I don't think worth a full star deduction. One thing I think it should have but no new boomboxes have is an external mic jack. Luckily I still have an old Walkman that makes stereo recordings with an external mic."
1,SONY BOOMBOX,"Bought this Boombox two years ago. Great sound and all, but this past July the CD player ceased to operate. Took it to a local repair shop and they told me it was a cheap player and not worth trying to fix. So beware of this product. I was surprised since it is a Sony and generally their products hold up very well."
5,The best for the buck,"I agree with the review that is written underneath this one~ when you recieve it, it is not attractive and you wonder ""Where in the world will I put this thing so it doesn't look like a space ship just landed from Venus?"" But when you turn it on.... It just dosen't matter. It has the best sound I have ever heard from a portable and you will have no need to own any other type of stero. If your looking for a CD player, this is the one."
3,"Love it, love it, love it . . . BUT . . .","The boombox is freaking magnificent! However, there are two features that I wish the CD player had: 1. The ability to select specific tracks, and 2. The ability to fast-forward within a track. If those features were incorporated, it would be PERFECT!"
5,Great,"Excellent sound. It looks different, like a spaceship but it is too heavy to fly. CD players are fragile by nature. Treat them gently or you will get the dreaded ""No Disk"" display. Great bass loud with no distortion."
4,Great for the money,"I bought this mainly for me and my teenagers to use outside by the pool. We mainly use it as an Ipod player, and my kids love it. (Lots of pounding base.) It's a little bulky, having both a CD player and cassette, which we'll hardly ever use. But it's still portable (handle) and has great sound for the money."
4,Cannot Play Metal or High Bias Tapes,"I find the Sony CFDG505 I great sounding boombox. The only problem, and to me a most significant problem, is the fact that it can only play and record on normal bias tapes. Metal and high bias tapes have been around for years. I have approximately 11 metal tapes and 1 high bias tape I have to convert to normal bias to prevent damage to the heads on this boom box. Why would Sony build a boom box that plays and records audio using only normal bias tapes. Obviously, the metal and high bias tapes provide for better sound and that is why many people recorded their old LPs and CDs onto metal and high bias tapes. I just can't figure this out. Well, I have a lot of converting to do."
1,junk,"I brought this item 1yr.and 1 month ago.It just compleatly stopped working,sony would not replace it.They said they could replace it for $78.00 dollars,I paid $96.00 for it,why would someone pay $78.00 dollars for something that just quits for no reason.I will never buy a sony prouduct agin."
5,good full sound,you can get plenty of bass with this unit and good mids and highs. Plenty of power but it sounds big and full even at a low volume. No complaints. Also nice that you can connect an Ipod or another unit to it to access it's speakers
5,Shy Smiley Face Red Faceplate,"Does anybody else besides me see the red faceplate as what appears to me as a shy, smiley facial expression...just wondering if any one else see's it besides me...anyways i just smile back...as far as the product itself...it gets the job done.:)"
1,Don't buy this. The 1-star reviews are right!,"Didn't buy mine from Amazon but shop here frequently and know that many others will buy here too. It simply stops working. It works fine but one day, out-of-the-blue, it will not play jack-squat (CD, Aux, Stereo, nothing). Sony will not repair it but will send a refurbished unit as a replacement for $86.73 +tax (shipping to you is included in this price). Note that shipping to Sony by you is NOT included. With that, it would nearly be the cost of a new one from Amazon."
5,AWESOME SOUND.,Could'nt have asked for a better sounding boombox. I play it at a very noisy factory and can hear it perfectly.
5,Works as advertised!,Wanted a fairly simple boom box for the wife as a kitchen radio. Its a little bigger then the one it replaced. Plays most of the CD's I burn on my PC even though it says it won't (the next model is advertised as having this capability). That was a chance I took and came out on the lucky side. Volume is fine. It seems most boom boxes don't go as loud as the old ones. With the line-in I can hook up my little MP3 player and get amplified sound. Solid player.
2,These don't work for very long,"I will give it this: the sound quality is great. However, I have dealt with a quantity of these because they were purchased for use in a music class in several different locations. We had problems with all of them. The player takes a long time to read a CD, which meant people standing around waiting while the teacher waited for the CD player. I didn't know how to rate 'battery life' because whenever it was used without the power cord, it would occasionally stop playing and then start back up - even with brand new batteries. Therefore, I always used the cord. Behaves itself fairly well with the iPod connection. Finally, none of them keep working for more than a year. When I first had trouble with them just not working (the teacher presses the power button and it turns on, then immediately off) I replaced it with the same product, thinking it was a fluke. Now they all need to be replaced.I would look elsewhere."
2,Power Button Works Terrible!!!!!,"This does not work right. We wanted one that you did not always have to keep turning the power button on and off. We had the music on last night and it went off automatically with the timer set up for the room (lights and music are to go on 9:00 am and off at 8:30 pm). This morning, I went into the room, no music. In order to hear the music, you had to hit the button.Even if you don't want it to automatically go on, our other one when we plugged it in to experiment, the music played. This one, when we plugged it in, no music. You had to hit the power button for any music.Also, it's too much to handle."
3,Nice Boombox - Fairly Pricy,"This box appears to be just what I needed in my woodworking shop. So far the desired functions have all worked. On the negative side, the instruction manual is somewhat lacking; however the unit itself is fairly intuitive and not too difficult to figure out. I use the AM and FM radio, the CD player, and the tape feature. Have not yet connected it to an external source. There is a fairly gaudy red light that comes on when the bass is boosted - My preference would be to eliminate that feature entirely. Also the unit would be much more user friendly if there was a light in the display and if the display was larger. Speaking of the display size, it is that little depression located just above the big X on the front - You can hardly see it!If those several items were better, the Sony CFDG505 would be worth a 5 star rating - the sound quality and radio reception is very good."
2,Disappointing,"I have a hearing deficit and bought Sony-CFDG CD RadioCassette Recorder because of the sound reproduction stars and comments. i knew there was no backlighting but because of the location on the front, it is impossible to read. More important is the too frequent static I get in the lower FM stations, listen primarily to npr and other classic music stations. My 1986! boom box it replaces had no static in the same location. The box/weight/size is just too big/heavy to return! I will have to move it to different locations in the room which are not my choice. I appreciate the remote. The CD sound is good. My mistake in purchase, not Amazon's presentation."
5,this sony CFDG505 was phenominal! It couldn't be better!,This sony CFDG505 is absolutly amazing! I may buy another one so I have this forever! I suggest youshould buy this!
1,"zero quality control, DOA , sending back to amazon","Looked nice, unpacked it, plugged it in, put in a CD,sound came on, cool, then I noticed that the sound button didn't work, I stopped the CD.20 seconds later, CD would not play.30 seconds later, powered it off, try to power back on. Power would not come back on.Tried a different outlet, power still not back on.tried the remote control... no power.Back online to amazon for aRETURN LABEL"
4,four stars only cuz it didn't last long,"this boombox has great sound, and I appreciate that it plays cds, cassette tapes, has radio, and has an aux input, all of which I use.However, now, after about 1 1/2 years, the cd player no longer works. It reads the cds, and even shows that it's playing the cd, but no sound comes out.I'm trying to decide whether to get it repaired or replaced; unfortunately, I may not find anything that plays cassettes; however, now a usb input has become more important anyway. =sigh= I wish these electronics were not created with ""planned obsolescence"" built into them..."
4,sound outweighs shortcomings,"I purchased this to replace a ten yr old sharp boombox, so there is no real comparison. It is used mainly on weekends outdoors at our summer home. The sound quality is truly outstanding. The other reason I bought it was the MP3 jack on the unit. It is great for listening and I have had loads of compliments on it. I plug in the MP3, set it to random-all, and it plays a better mix of my music than I could getting up and flipping CDs. Plus I don't have to lug my CD case there anymore. It's only drawbacks, as others have said, are its size and the small, unlit LCD screen. I do not use batteries, so I cannot rate that aspect. This baby is big and weighs about 20 lbs."
2,A Mistake,"First of all, I bought this item assuming I could connect it to my iMac and, using Garage Band, download taped music onto my computer. Well, it doesn't do this. The fault is probably not with the boom box. I lack the technical knowledge to use it for this purpose. I can hardly blame Sony for this. True, it does play tapes, and there does seem to be a difference when I adjust the sound output for the various frequencies, tho this is subtle. The sound is good, but our 40 year old Harmon Karden set is superior. Apart from the fact the the product resembles a Martian land rover, my main complaint is that it is too temperamental when I try to play CDs. Some tracks and even some CDs simply refuse to play at all. Also I get cases of musicus interruptus with the CDs. If I had known all this I would not have bought the product."
2,"Sound Quality Dissappointing, Just Loud","I decided to order this boombox based on the positive reviews. I am an audiophile, but I've never had the money to indulge in the highest end products. I wouldn't say that I'm overly picky, but I truly value sound quality above all else. I found the sound quality of this boombox to be disappointing at best, and ultimately returned it. Yes, it is loud (which is why it probably has so many positive reviews) but even at low volume levels there is a audible buzz that I found distracting, and it did not live up to my expectations.I will also add that it is huge (about twice the depth you'd expect from a boombox) and most shelf systems are smaller, although perhaps not as portable. Even a low end shelf system (starting at about the same price as this boombox) would typically have much better sound quality than this thing."
5,Excellent Baking Book,"I received this book a few weeks ago and have made several things out of it. My family and I have thoroughly enjoyed everything out of it. My husband's favorite is the banana bread! Easy and simple recipes. Some do require time to let dough rise, but it's worth it! Love it."
2,"Great Photos, but little information","I expected more from this book. It is basically a non-technical review of composition for the beginner. The photos are really great, but they don't list the usual information used to get them (lens type, settings, filters, etc.). I really didn't gain any insight from this book, and doubt that anyone other than a beginning photographer would either.For landscape photography, and for photography in general, their basic photography guide is much better."
3,"Get the NatGeo ""general"" Field Guide instead","I bought this as an addition to the ""general"" Nat Geo Field Guide that I already had. It really added very little. If you're just going to get one, get the general one as it covers the landscapes and a lot more."
5,A brilliant collection......,"A recording worthy of sitting down to LISTEN and enjoy. Barry Manilow takes you by the hand and leads you on a journey of dreams, romance and heart. His interpretations paint lovingly sensitive picture stories. Mr. Manilow, thank you for this treasure."
5,Happy,"If you love Barry and loved the only movie he ever made, you will love this. Recommend for Barry Manilow fans and lovers of good music to listen to."
1,"One Song,,,,,","I bought this for CopaCabana,,,the 2005 Mix is decent....paid 2 cents for it,,wouldn't pay more than that,,,"
4,If you like mucicalls and lovesongs.,"If you are just a little bit romantic and like the voice of manilow you should buy this album. It's easy-listening music wonderful to hear over a candlelight dinner or in the car. F.ex the tune ""sweet heaven I'm in love again"". If you like BM you will love this album."
5,A must have for anyone who loves Barry or true Broadway,This album is a beautiful display of the true artistry and musical genius of Barry Manilow and Bruce Sussman. These original works are two beautiful passonate stories. One a fictional love story/ mystery(Copacabana(at the copa) and the other a story of courage and love from Nazi Germany (Harmony). Barry is back and woman are swooing and cheering join the fun find out what everyone is buzzing about pick-up SCORES today
4,Band very small,"I bought this watch for my sister, 'cause she graduated from Law School. Unfortunately, the band is too small. This watch is either for a 10-12 year old girl or for very small women. For a regular women, it may not fit."
2,Sounds great clean...,"These strings sound great on clean, but as soon as you add even the smallest amount of distortion, you are able to hear your fingers sliding on the strings. This creates an annoying squeaky sound which was so irritating i took the strings off immediately. I dont know if I'm doing something wrong but I'm pretty sure Zakk Wylde wouldn't put up with the sound coming from these."
2,Only partially compatible with the knife it's made for,"There's no indication anywhere except in a tiny note on the back of the package (which means you won't know until you've paid and waited for it):""Will not retract into 10-109 knife."""
5,Dragon Soul,"Brief facts about the show before review.Blu Ray Region: A, B (Can be watched on Japanese, American, Canadian, European(UK, Europe etc) players.Language: Japanese and EnglishBlu Rays: 2Number of Episodes: 13.Entertainment value: Priceless.Contains Episodes: 53-65Basically this is the aftermath of the Freiza Saga and involves Goku returns to Earth. The appearance of Frieza and his father King Cold, and Trunks.I would call these episodes nothing short of excellent. They add some much needed drama, the humor and enjoyment of seeing Frieza getting what he deserves.Also worth noting the ending episodes set up the Android Saga(Episodes 59 to 63)English dub like always is worth watching. Japanese is good too."
5,"Great Axe: Gimli, Son of Gloin would be proud to have wielded such a mighty weapon.","The subject says it all. As a Lotr fanatic this axe pleased me to the core, from the elegant packaging to the certificate of authenticity. I was astounded."
4,Pretty Slick,"i had my doubts about this, because of the price, but it is awesome! and the plaque it comes with looks flimsy at first, or that it would break, but it holds it solid. It looks great, it feels sturdy, and man is it heavy!it came brand new it the box, with the Axe, a wall mount, certificate of authentication, and was here before the estimated arrival. the only downside to it, was that the leather-wrapped handle was just one large piece of leather with impressions of the cord-wrap, and sewed up in the back, as well as the fact that the leather felt like it was loose, there seemed to be a slight air bubble in it. but other than that it looks awesome, had a great price, and if I'm looking for more of the LOTR Replicas, i know where to go to!"
2,OK,I have to say of the books that I have read regarding health and a natural way of going about your health this is one I would not purchase but perhaps take out at the library. There are a few things of interest but nothing earth shaking or new.
2,Does the job but....,"The hardware is cheap and it did fall off after a few rides. The rack did not come with directions on how to put the rack on. This would have been nice because I ended up putting it on wrong.Pros: Very SturdyCons: No directions, Cheap hardware.Would I recommend this to a friend: Probably not."
4,Good News and Bad News,"The good news is that this is a great fragrance for guys over 30. I found it years ago in a U.S. department store. The name refers to an Italian tennis star. While the company that makes toiletries and clothing that uses his name is still in business, this fragrance is no longer manufactured. That's the bad news. The replacement is a bit too strong for my taste. I was very pleased with the speed and condition of the bottles I ordered as well as the price."
4,Swimming with the dead,This was a well written easy read. The plot was good and the descriptions of the BVI diving was accurate. I enjoyed the book. The plot was basic and easy to follow yet well written.
4,Mystery in Paradise,"Without repeating details given in the main reviews, I can say that I especially enjoyed this murder mystery set in the BVI because I am captivated by the BVI, having both sailed and scuba-dived there. Having sailed right by the marker buoy for the Chikuzen wreck, I can easily visualize the scenes that took place there. And Kathy Brandt's descriptions of the islands and several dive sights serve to bring back many fond memories. The book is an easy read and will probably soon be a staple aboard many of the charter boats in the BVI fleets. Like others, I am looking forward to the next in the series."
5,Trust me: You're going to love this book,"After you finish this book, you'll want to buy five more to give to your friends. It's that kind of novel. I'm planning on putting the book in a basket with a tea cup, delicious tea and some cookies for those long, cold months of January and February. My friends are going to love it!What makes Swimming with the Dead so wonderful isn't just the beautiful Bahama setting -- although it is lovely, and Kathy Brandt writes so well that you can taste the salt water and feel the heat -- but the story, and Hannah Sampson.Hannah is the kind of woman you already feel you know. She's strong and smart and funny, imperfect and yet striving to be a better person. I found myself hoping she'd solve the mystery, instead of knowing that she would.Get in on the ground floor of what promises to be a really wonderful series. And keep those winter blues away with some hot sandy beaches, silky smooth Carribean water, and a dash of murder."
4,Good,"This book was good, but would go back and forth a little too much for my tastes, however a great database for knowledge of not only the authors but the subjects their lives were involved in."
4,Love it!,"I like my jewelry to have a little weight, and this watch qualifies, both as a timepiece and a hefty bracelet. It's a little large on my wrist--not that it will fall off--but I'd rather keep it like that than take a link out. The pink face is more opalescent than the photo shows, but that's okay, too. It's a nice watch for dressy days at the office. And hey, it's Hugo Boss, the price was great, and oh yeah, it tells the time, too."
3,Lightweight & Shiny,"I purchased this watch after much reviewing of options :- Bulova's, Movado's, etc. From the reviews and the picture, this watch seemed like the perfect choice. But I'm afraid on receiving the watch, I can't say it's remarkable.It is lightweight and I like my watches to have some substance to them. Also, I found the metal band to be a bit too shiny for my taste, not to mention it is also quite loose on my wrist.I don't think I'll be returning the watch, but for $100+ and being Hugo Boss, I guess I was simply expecting a little more."
4,"A ""transition"" album between the first and Happy Together","You Baby, the Turtles second long-player, finds them to be in somewhat of an identity crisis. Although they were moving towards a new, ""Lovin' Spoonful""-esque image with the title song, they obviously had quite a bit of folk rock left over (and more yet showed up on Wooden Head).So this album is like a bridge, basically, between It Ain't Me Babe and the cheerier Happy Together. Not to say it isn't good! Just a Room, the title song...quite a few tracks here more than make the cut. However, the patchwork nature of the album can be more than a bit distracting.There are two issues of this album availible: this one, and the one on Sundazed Records. THIS is the one to get; the Sundazed has marginally better sound quality, but this REPERTOIRE RECORDS issue has the complete mono/stereo program, plus two incredibly bizarre bonus tracks."
4,Stylish and Practical,"These caps do exactly what they're supposed to do, but they look nicer than the standard black or grey plastic caps, and of course being metal and all they're much more durable too. The price isn't bad, and the picture is accurate if you're wondering how it matches up to what you'll actually receive. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product."
3,Why would you Need it?,All the songs on this album are available on the two=for albums now so I would not buy this product.
4,a lot of fun,I bought this book for my 15-year old son who loves baseball...he loved the book and that made me happy. Then my husband picked it up and read a few chapters. It tells a lot of different stories from baseball history and tells about many baseball personalities. It's a simple and easy topic that isn't too heavy and is a lot of fun to read about old-fashioned baseball games.
3,Great Coverage/ Big Mess,"As a newbie to red hair, I listened when my hair dresser said I should get the red Bumble and Bumble hair powder. I'm not going to lie - it works amazingly to cover those roots and enhance your color. And it looks beautiful! Just be sure to run across where you part your hair with a Q-Tip so you don't have a red scalp... that looks a bit funny.The problem is that it gets EVERYWHERE. It coats everything in sight! The bathroom floor, counters, walls, etc. and your skin - neck and ears especially. After spraying your head, it's best to throw a hair cap on and rinse off in the shower to get it off your skin. I was afraid I was breathing it in, so I would wear a medical face mask. But when I would take that off, the red still got through onto the top of my nose!!! As of late, I've gone with a darker shade of red hair color and have stopped using the red powder. I'll keep it for rare occasions, but am not comfortable using it regularly."
5,Hemi-sync is wonderful stuff,"I've accumulated many different CD's with sounds and music to use in meditation, but this is the cleanest sound quality and the most creative sound/music I could imagine. It makes the others insignificant in comparison. I'm looking forward to listening to other Hemi-sync CDs."
4,It Delivers,"The CD really assists in placing one in a relaxed, meditative state. My son, who suffers from anxiety attacks, found it very helpful in reducing the length and severity of his attacks. Well worth the money."
5,superb romantic score!,"This is one of the all-time greatest romantic films!It may not have done well at the box office, but it hascertainly established itself very well in the ensuingyears! It's an absolutely wonderful score. It shows thepower that music can create even when it is done witha measure of subtleness. This is another very hard-to-findCD, but it's worth searching for. Also it's by far thebest release of this soundtrack."
4,A mi vieja si le gusto.,"Lo compre para mi vieja que ya me habia estado presionando, pero en mexico no lo encontre, esta chido."
4,Beautiful music from Somewhere in Time,"[[ASIN:B000002PCS Somewhere In Time: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack I love to listen to the soundtrack from this movie. I have been walking around humming this song since I saw the movie. Finally decided to get the soundtrack, and am not dissapointed. It is beautiful music."
5,A Classic Romance,"I remember being a teenager and my Father making me watch this movie and I FELL IN LOVE!! Over the years, the story and the music has remained in my heart. Now that I'm getting married, this BEAUTIFUL music will have a place in our ceremony as well as our wedding memories for many years to come."
4,Listen to Love,This soundtrack is an emotional journey of true love. It brings back the moment in time when I felt the most love in my life. The music is bone melting and washes all pain away. If you haven't seen this movie...you should do so with someone you love. A true romantic will love having this CD as part of their collection of great music. It is an awsome escape.
5,Wonderful,This soundtrack is wonderful. The music is so beautiful. I have been listening to it over and over.
4,Romantic,From one of the most romantic movies of all time comes some of the most romantic music of all time. And anything from the legendary composer John Barry is great. I also own his Dances With Wolves and Out of Africa soundtracks. Just sit back and close your eyes.
3,great soundtrack!,"Item exactly as expected. Beatiful music. However, I ordered two copies and BOTH arrived with badly cracked jewel cases. I wrote to the seller to tell them of this problem, but they never offered to replace the cases. Jewel cases are inexpensive, so I just bought my own. But, seller should package better."
3,Somewhere in Time: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,This music is both relaxing and uplifting. I own lots of movie soundtracks but this is my all-time favorite.
5,Beautiful Sound Track,"Heard this quite a few years ago...along with the sound track from Out of Africa. A perfect twosome...lovely, lilting romantic music."
4,Relaxing Music,I downloaded this music to my hard drive at work and now I can enjoy wonderful soothing music my entire day. I know all of the songs and they are all favorites of mine!
5,Somewhere in Music...,This music is wonderful!!! I love the movie and the music makes it even better!! I highly reccommend anyone to get this.
3,Sounds better in the movie,"Some will wonder what I mean by ""sounds better in the movie"" in my title to this review: when you are actually watching the film, with the music serving as background, it seems a bit more upbeat than it does when the music is isolated. Some of the CD sounds a bit too somber for my taste. One really outstanding track on here, though, is Rhapsody On A Theme Of Paganini, simply a great piece of music, and probably worth owning the CD for."
3,Latino?,"Lacks Latino influence. It's nice that it has steel drums in some of songs. Sounds like easy listening music that you'd hear on a sea cruise to get everyone in a good mood. Some of the cover songs are -""I Can See Clearly Now,"" ""Jammin',"" ""No Woman, No Cry,"" ""I Shoot the Sheriff."" Doesn't that sound more Jamacian than latino?"
4,Terrific debut,"Not too many bands out there putting out straight ahead rock and roll. Not heavy metal, not rap-metal, not grunge. Just straight ahead rock and roll in the AC/DC, Aerosmith, G-n-R vien. But American Pearl is very different lyrically. The songs are not of the typical let's get drunk/high/stoned... variety(not that there's anything wrong with that!). They deal with matters of the heart, spirituality, morality without ever sounding preachy or heavy handed. It's a fine line to walk and American Pearl never crosses it. Musically the album is bold and muscular. A few of the songs could use a little work in the bridge parts and neither of the guitarists is going to make Slash put his Les Paul away. But it's obvious that American Pearl has enough talent as songwriters and players to be around a while. In the same vien as Buckcherry musically but on a completely different planet lyrically."
2,I was expecting more...,"I bought this CD about a week after it came out. I was swayed by the low price tag and the buzz that was surrounding the band. I had heard many people giving thumbs up. Then I put it in my CD player. While they are very talented musicians, they have a lot of developing to do. Their songwriting is simplistic and cliched. Honestly, I don't hate this album, but I don't particularly like it, either.Let's face it, their blend of tattoos and up-tempo rock is something that doesn't exactly bring to mind ""talent."" IN fact, Kevin's voice does become quite irritating after just a couple of songs. Look at the lyrics. In the opening tune, ""California"" he rhymes ""day"" with ""away."" In the very next track, ""Automatic"" he repeats that rhyme with ""today"" and ""away."" To me it seems he is ""lyrically challenged."""
2,American Pearl,"I bought this CD a few days ago, and I was deceived by the glorifying reviews displayed for the CD. Granted, they write their own music; it sounded alright, but it was like, the music and the lyrics didn't correspond, but did. It's not as good as everyone said it was, but it's an alright CD. I'd say it's like a mix of Creed with Bush."
1,Welcome to stink-town!,"Wow, talk about unoriginal garbage. This is it. Unless your name is Andy, avoid this pile of over-ripe (...junk) with all of your might!"
3,"Good Rock and Roll - American Pearl, Wind-Up","The Wind-Up cd by American Pearl is fun to listen to. I really like the song ""10 Amphetamine Girl"". It has a fast guitar beat, good lyrics and when I listen to the song I feel I am at a hard-rock concert jumping up and down. I can almost smell the leather jackets and see the amphetamine in the girls eyes. I would recommend this cd even if it is only for that one song."
3,"Great Band, but...","American Pearl and this album are both great. No questions there. Seriously, though? You NEED a better quality copy of the Album Art. It's flippin' TINY!! >.< I also can't find the album art anywhere else on the internet thus far, so it only really adds to the frustration when the only image I can find looks like a five-year old scanned it in (and I mean that in the nicest way possible). Really, such a good band and album deserves to be done justice with high-quality, sharp-looking album art as it plays in an MP3 Player, but I can't even -work- with this image. If I try to crop out the tons of blank white space and increase the size of what's left, it only pixelates the living Hell out of it and it looks terrible. You've got a great CD there. PLEASE go back and redo the album art. For the love of Rock n' Roll..."
4,great hard alternative rock,"I got this album for a christmas cd,i must say i was impressed.I am sorry that they only did one cd, but the album they did was great.They kind of remined me of kings of the sun.If you like good rock and roll you like american pearl."
4,Very strong debut,"I've been loving this album for about a year now, I first heard American Pearl on the Scream 3 soundtrack, and their straight-ahead rock style really got me interested. Their album wasn't out back then, so I kinda forgot about them. That was until I saw them open for creed at madison square garden. Immediately after that I went out and bought their album. And it was definately worth the measley 10 bucks. Musically, they fall into a style that is practically non-existant in today's music scene..just rock. But I like them more than other rock revivalists (a la buckcherry) because their lyrical content is much more personal and not of the AC/DC variety."
5,Awesome music and awesome guys!,"I saw these guys open up for Creed and 3 doors down this past summer, and they were excellent! I wish I could see them headline on a tour! After I saw them preform, a friend of mine and I bought the cds, and waiting by the entrance to backstage for the band members to come out and sign stuff. We waiting quite a while until finally the drummer came out. He was so nice!! He signed our cds with personal notes, pointed out stuff to us, made lovely small talk, and even went all the way back stage to get us two stickers! Later we met the rest of the guys, who we didn't get a good chance to talk to because of the other people waiting to talk to them. I found that these guys are really a bunch of down to earth, nice guys! That never hurts for a band, and it especially doesn't hurt that their music rocks!"
5,True Rock given an edge!!!,"This band promises to be one of the hottest new rock bands on the market. And that's not easy to say given the recent explosion of rock bands. With a true old-school, hard rock edge that is almost impossible to come by in today's market, American Pearl gives a refreshing slant on the current trend. Positive and driving, this CD is essential to any fan of rock music."
4,pretty impressive debut!!!!!!!,wow this is a really good cd it has a lot of adrenaline pumping guitar cords and raw lyrics that can take u straight to the bone but the reason i only gave it four stars is because alot of it is repetitivebut any hoo it is still a good debut so u should by this cd!!!!!!!
5,Change your world...,"Just unpacked and installed this product and I can't believe it took me this long to wise up. Where I had previously stacked miscellaneous boxes and stands to accommodate my monitors, I now elevated a pair of 19"" widescreens to the perfect level, relieving my neck strain and freeing up an enormous amount of desk space. Beautifully, my wife can simply adjust the monitors to her satisfaction, no tools or strain involved!The desk mount is solid, simple to install and highly adjustable once installed -- and it actually looks great. The nice surprise is the surfeit of hardware this item comes with: two arm extensions, an optional notebook rack and nuts and bolts galore, including actually usable tools for the job.The grommet installation has allowed me to install this using the existing cable apertures in the desk, but I can imagine this item working on almost any layout or configuration."
4,"tricky to install, but bad-ass","Okay,the ease of install could be a little better, but really there is no major reason to complain. You just gotta look at the diagrams, and do a little wrench work. When I dumped out all the parts, anticipation was worse than actual difficulty of install. The work great, and I'm thinking about getting a third arm (w/ an extender) for my third screen.Customer service sucks and is clueless, but anyone who invests in these is going to be smarter than customer service anyways.A good buy for the cash."
3,Not exactly a quick install,"I'd give the product 5 stars but for the failure to disclose how much of a pain the installation is. The product description says it is ""no drill installation,"" which led me to believe I'd walk out, plop it on the ground at the back of the Element, bolt it up and be done. The first step in the instructions, however, is to enlarge one hole on each side of the frame. I don't know how everyone else did this, because the holes aren't in a place where they can be reached with a drill. The holes only need about an extra 1/32"" of radius to accommodate the bolts and spacers. After about 20 minutes with a grinder stone on my Dremel, I'd begun to wish I'd just hooked up the torch. The little fish-tape tool is totally cool. The hitch is solid, the fit is tight, and it looks good on the car. Bought it with Amazon Prime and it shipped quickly and arrived in a box darn near big enough to put the whole car in."
2,"No hardware, no instructions, no pin, no cap","I received the hitch assembly unwrapped with zero items to accompany. I haven't installed it yet, but thankfully the other reviewers have provided help with that. I can only hope that it will fit reasonably well."
5,what a wonderful christmas CD!!!,I listened to this all during the holiday season! I loved the unique arrangements and the spirit of wendy's voice! Great!
3,"Great resource, poor book binding","This is the only book on XHTML/HTML I've looked at in much detail, so I've no basis for comparison. However, this book is packed with very useful information on the tags, attributes, and CSS properties. The examples are good and are nearly always provided with screenshots of the renderings in one or more browsers. Contains a good summary of CSS support by the major browsers.My biggest complaint is that this book is rapidly falling apart! It is not from overuse. I have other paperback reference books that are older which I refer to more frequently that are fine. The binding on this one is failing fast."
3,Not for the Novice,"When I purchased this book I was hoping that it would be concise and easy to follow. Unfortunately, I found it to be quite the opposite. There is a lot of information which I found very confusing. Luckily I had handouts from a course I took in school and was able to decipher some of the information. So now I'm looking for a book that's written for beginners."
3,A Little Different,"This Cd is good, but much different then regular choke albums, the songs are a lot softer and longer, not that thats bad. If you think of this album as its own album and dont compare to other choke albums it's pretty good."
4,Good Movie,"Yes, it's about bugs. It's a pretty interesting concept. I love the director. It's very dark, which is typical. I'd recommend for people who like horror movies."
4,I play college basketball....,Since high school I always played better with Wilson Evolution balls. Received it and bring it with me everywhere I go! I also bought the 6$ pump that works good too. Must have if your serious about ball playing or want to learn. A+++
2,Not official size!!,"The claim made on the description is that it is official size but when I received it, it is a little smaller than an official size basketball."
5,Best option for buying game balls,"I bought several of these for a team I coach, and they have workouted great. The Wilson evolution is the standard for indoor game balls. Simply put: great product, best price available.The only downside was that the box these were shipped in came a little torn, but that caused no issues for me."
4,good indoor basketball,"The reason I gave this basketball 4 stars instead of 5 is b/c this basketball is only good indoors. DO NOT play with this basketball outside. In a matter of weeks it will deteriorate if you play with it outside. This basketball also gets a little wet if you sweat a lot so wear wristbands and keep it away from your shirt. All in all, it has the greatest feel ever for a basketball. If you are going to use this basketball for indoor purposes, there is no better basketball."
5,Great durable ball,"Good weight, grip, and balance. it's the ball my gym has on hand, and I was hooked. Have enjoyed it."
5,Great ball !,We played the ball 5 times a week for the past month. It has very good control and good shot feel..
1,"Warped, lopsided","I've always enjoyed playing with Evolutions so I decided to get one myself. It arrives rather quickly and once I get it on the hardwood it bounces irregularly, so basically it is useless. It feels great in my hands tho...."
3,My ball was finally chosen as the game ball,"You always want your ball to be chosen as the game ball at pickup games. I bought this ball and an hour later my ball was the game ball for the rest of the day. Only problem? I don't really like the ball. Its very spongy and hard to control. Its not a terrible ball, but just not my style. i'll try the old tf-1000 next."
2,Blemished,"I added my 2 cents to Tujungan's review below as well, but like he said I think I got a blemished ball. The packaging was sketchy, it came loose in the shipping box with just a bag on it. Some of the letters are already scratched off where it says 'Advanced Microfiber Composite', and some of the seams are very poorly glued, off-center, edges sticking up, etc.I will be returning it and maybe just buying another TF-1000. It's been my favorite ball for years, but I thought I would try something cheaper, I guess that's what happens, you get what you pay for.editted for typo"
1,I wish zero stars were an option....,"The ball is too heavy, and the composite microfiber is way too grippy/rough. It feels like the same material that the NBA rejected a few years ago. After using the ball for a few days, I actually noticed small tears in the skin on my hands."
2,Indoor Only!,"I was very dissappointed that this basketball is an indoor ball only. In the description it says indoor/outdoor and even on the box that it comes in says the same thing, but the ball itself clearly states indoor only. Very dissappointing that they would mislead you!"
5,The best indoor basketball ever!!!,"Nice grip!! I have tried several balls, and Wilson Evolution is the best so far! By the way, I play basketball 3 to 4 times a week.."
5,Mini review,"I got the ball today. The ball came in it's own box, the one you see at the store. I like the feel of the ball, it's got this soft spongy feel to it. It's not hard like most of the ball I had used before. One interesting thing I had noticed was the black line is not rubber at all. It's covered with the composite leather.overall, I like this ballnote - for anybody that is looking for a basketball, do not get the tf-1000 zk pro. My local gym when it first open, got 10 of these, now, it's all scuff up and lopsided. I have no idea how it can be lopsided. I never seen anyone kick the ball or taken half court shot with it."
5,This is where it is at,I first started listening to OAR when my friend sent me some mp3's. Now I can't get enough of these guys. It is kind of a folk sound that is very catchy and easy to listen to. The lyrics are great and I would highly recommend either this album or Soul's Aflame to anyone bored of the everyday pop music scene. This is something that you can mellow out to.
5,This is the recording of Athalia to own!,"I have three recordings of this outstanding work, and this one is by far the best. Ignore the review regarding the sound quality--he must be listening on faulty speakers, for my recording is superb."
1,Try another recording.,"Gorgeous Handelian score, but the acoustics of this performance are just awful. Two of us listened for 10 minutes before we could understand a single word! That word was ""Silence!"", and it seemed appropriate to stop listening at that point."
2,Waste of Money,"1 game ... 20 minutes of play time ... Waste of money. My daughter likes it but once it's over, she starts it again thinking something different will happen. She's only had it for 2 days and has already retired it. It's really a waste."
4,Al-kitaab al-Thaanii,"While the al-Kitaab series is not without its flaws--among which must be counted an overemphasis, in this reader's opinion, on the Egyptian dialect of Arabic--it remains the best of the several offerings available. And this second volume is notable for correcting what was perhaps the most lamentable weakness of the first volume; namely, a lack of attention to the acquisition of vocabulary, which must necessarily underwrite advanced language learning (particularly in the context of Arabic, whose grammar is not especially difficult). Still and all, an attractive and eminently useful course, made the more so by the inclusion of well-designed DVDs to aid in oral comprehension. Recommended, with only very minimal reservations."
3,Al-Kitaab fil Ta'allum al-Arabiy (Textbook),"Excellent..but again, this product is ""not"" in the dialect I'm learning. Had I known that, I probably would not have purchased it. So, I'm struggling with it, but I love the format, and I love the idea/methodology."
3,Arabic grammar text used in Universities,"This text is chosen by several Universities for teaching Arabic grammar.It does use the vocabulary of the Media and Modern Standard Arabic. TheDVD's are useful as drill and practice replacing the Lab atmosphere andare quite practical. Nonetheless, I find the organzation a bit disorganized and disjointed and the explanations too short and incomplete.I am using it but find it awkward and a bit stereotyped in how it presentsits examples."
5,excellent text book,"The Alif Baa and Al Kitaab text books are wonderful for learning Arabic. They are best in the context of a formal course, but could be used for individual study as well."
1,Very Disappointed,I did not receive either the book or all the CD's.This book has four CD's and out of the four CD's I only received just one CD and no book. I will never buy anything from amazon.com in the future. But I still want to get the book back or refund my money.
5,A wonderful stroll down memory lane,"An excellent look at the rise and challenges of the Macintosh. To me, this book was a bit of a trip down memory lane. I remember some of the very applications that Levy describes. I remember the frustrations of first using a personal computer, but didn't know the backstory behind the development of the Mac. Rife with interesting parables from key players like Atkinson and Woz, this is a really interesting book that ages surprisingly well."
1,Not so insanely great ...,"This book is bad enough, with respect to both technology and history, that it is hardly worth a review. The author's grasp of computer technology, or lack of it, is ludicrous. He relies on word-of-mouth from selfserving informants instead of research. Even the editing of the book is severely lacking: Misspellings and especially ungramatical constructions are rife. It's a book I would definitely not pass on.Finally, though I bow to no one in my admiration of the Macintosh (I've owned enough of them since '84 and a Star before that), the MacSycophancy expressed in the book is almost embarassing."
4,A nice book on Apple before Steve's Second Coming,"This book is too friendly to Apple, I have to say. I've been studying Apple history for many years, I find this book full of interesting facts, but to friendly to Apple's many mistakes.If you just want to know about the history of the PowerMac, you can read its excerpt on MacWorld. Which issue I have forgotten.An easier rean than Jim Carlton's book which is long and tedius. I find Another book, _Infinite Loop_ deeper. Though many don't like that book, because the author seemed to sour grape."
5,This book accurately describes the introductoin of the Mac.,"Steven Levy tells a gripping tale of the personal computer enviroment during the 80s, and details the advent of the GUI, or graphical user interface, which Xerox pioneered and apple popularized. Ever wonder where Windows came from?"
4,A humorous and compelling view on the intro of the Mac,Once again Steven Levy hits tops with this book. A complete background on the characters and events that lead to the introduction of the Apple Macintosh. The book is a little on the short side and there are some areas that I feel Steven could have covered in more depth. It's not as good as Hackers but still a worthy purchase.
3,fast reading and informative,"Insanely Great was an informative, fast reading book that keeps you interested as Steven Levy takes you through the history of the Macintosh and into the garages it was created in. However, Levy does have an unusual enthusiasm for Macintosh and I think that leads his book to be somewhat biased."
3,Good enlightenment on computer history,"This book follows the evolution of the Mac from its humble beginnings to its current grandeur. However, Levy is so enthusiastic about the Mac that this sometimes makes his objectivity seem questionable. On the upside he is very conscientious about giving credit where it is due and can delve into technical details without being boring or too abstract. Overall, this book is a good read for anyone who wants to get a clue about the history of computers."
5,A great crash course book on computing history.,"Steven Levy's ""Insanely Great"", chronicles the development of the Apple Macintosh computer. From its early conception as one man's vision of the future to its fine-tuning. Levy is pretty detailed through the step by step developments of the Macintosh, but does not get too technical as to get a everyday person lost in a bunch of computer jargon. I recommend this book to those interested in how computers went from DOS prompts to the Microsoft Windows and Mac visual interfaces we are familiar with today."
2,Drying - maybe the lemon?,"Noticed a drying result from using the conditioner and shampoo, I am guessing it is the lemon. I have discontinued using this."
4,The Road Not Taken,I love the poems in this book. I was disappointed that there were not more of his poems there to read.
1,"Kindle edition is only 5 poems, NOT the Untermeyer edition","Beware if you order this Kindle edition. It is NOT the Untermeyer edition as described in the paperback edition description. This Kindle edition contains 5 poems: The Road Not Taken, Birches, An Old Man's Winter Night, A Patch of Old Snow, The Bonfire. The ""cover page"" of the Kindle edition lists this as a 1916 edition from Henry Holt and Company, New York. I am a new Kindle owner and am discovering that sometimes a link to a Kindle edition is not the same as the paper edition of the book you are looking at on Amazon. At least very true for most of the poetry books I have researched."
2,"Quiet Cool nice, Hard Justice & Outside the Law are poor","Quiet Cool as I guessed before watching is the best movie on this triple feature dvd, Hard Justice and Outside the Law looks like cheaply made movies (B-movie) and too unrealistic in the punch for punch action. Out of the two B-movies I better found Outside the Law satisfying, that deserves my only two stars."
4,Stars in the rating don't matter. Look at the star(let)s!!,How did this movie escape my attention for so long?Production values? Direction? Plot?Feh.Buffs and especially B-movie fans should examine the cast:Julie Adams! Mamie Van Doren! Allison Hayes! Mara Corday!Enough said.
2,incomplete,"i ordered two of these hinge springs.the back of package is very limited. and says complete instructions enclosed in packaging.no instructions enclosed. basically if youre not an engineer , good luck installing"
3,alternative use,"I read that these may be noisy if unlubricated... I thought it might be fun to temporarily make my front door squeaky for halloween. I can't vouch for the scaryness of the sound tho. As they say in software development circles - it's not a bug, it's a feature!"
4,Very good book,"The book was written a few years ago, but its arguments remain current. A last chapter was written in this new edition to incorporate the post 9-11 world. If you are interested in learning factual and not political arguments about the reality of our borders, grab this book and study it."
4,Great read,This book really gives a different view to the policing on the Mexican Border and how the United States has evoked many of the events that lead to the consequences we are now dealing with. The author has many resources and is very credited.
5,"Wake up America, and smell the Government Corruption!","What the heck is our Congress thinking of???? This book clearly lays out how easy it will be for terrorist to get us by easily crossing the border at will. Why is this still so??? If you like this book you should also read, ""U.S. Customs, Badge of Dishonor"" another narrative of our Government's border blunders."
3,I like it,"It holds 12 pairs of shoes on each side, so 24 all together, with very deep pockets, it was able to hold some of my platform shoes, no boots though. The fabric could be a little more sturdy, it reminds me of the material that is used for raincoats. i was also able to put my boots boxes at the bottom and still put my entire summer wardrobe away, which is a lot! it took me about 15 minutes to put together."
1,Doesn't hold much w/o breaking,You cannot fill this closet w/o the bar bending and all your clothes falling down. It holds very little b/c it doesn't support much weight. Not worth it.
4,tiggerladi,"Got this for a roomate so she could have some extra storage. It is very easy to put together. Two tired girls and no tools put it together in 10 minutes. It is good size lots of extra storage. I wouldn't put your heaviest clothing items in it but its great. Well made, sturdy. It is not meant to be handled in a rough manor but it is great extra storage. I would highly recommend this item."
