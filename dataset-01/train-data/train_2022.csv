2,the usual mixture,"I don't know why writers have this overwhelming need to bring down every happy couple. Why can't some of them remain happy? However, it turns out the divorce doesn't really happen and Rory and Amy love each other as much as they always did. Sorry, spoiler.Lots of color, action, bangs and noises as usual. Not much of a plot. The final couple of twists to the story were interesting, I won't add any more spoilers, though.I like Matt Smith as the Doctor. But the Matt Smith stories lack the emotional depth and character interest of the David Tennant stories. That's not Matt Smith's fault. It's the fault of the writers."
3,So far ... not bad,"Two episodes in and I've got to say, not bad.So far the show has gone full throttle with wheeling out a Dalek centric premier and then a all out crazy fest of outdoing itself second episode. But reign in that inner fan boy and you'll see a lot of ""huh, but, what?"" moments in the plots (episode one: why not teleport a nuclear warhead onto the planet rather than teleport the Doctor and two companions to turn a force field off so you can bomb it from space? episode two: Why don't you just get in your TARDIS, travel back in time to warn the Silurians of the treasure hunter?). Season 7 has ton of flash to it so far, but it's missing something. I don't know what that something is just yet, but I'm hoping is shows up sooner rather than later."
5,Long Live The Doctor!,"So far, so good. I doubt they can top season 6,The Silence are brilliant. But Doctor Who is a GREAT show that should continue for at least another 50 years."
5,best of the season so far,"We have found Season 7 of Dr. Who to be a little disappointing after the fantastic last two seasons. However, A Town Called Mercy offers redemption in more ways than one. Well done."
4,Enjoyable with several profound moments,"I enjoyed this one, partly because I can never turn down a good Western, particularly one with science fiction elements. While this was hardly FIREFLY, this was a well-scripted and well-acted episode that had two of the three things I love in Doctor Who -- moments of very real, almost cruelly painful human emotion in a landscape of wonders -- and moments of ethical speculation, ethical riddles. I love that.A drawback: Amy and Rory are really just background -- no real role to play in this script, which is unfortunate, as the Doctor and the one-time characters in this episode had so much depth. I'm not actually why Amy & Rory were in this episode at all; the script had nothing meaningful for them to say or do, and they weren't even on screen much.But this was a solid episode and I liked the ending. A lot.Stant"
2,Overpriced Prequel that amounts to a webisode,"A few cool effects, but nothing really happens. I'm sure there are some things going on that may give more meaning to future episodes, but still quite a rip-off for $.99.SPOILERSA hooded figure use physic powers to communicate to the Doctor, telling him to go to a planet. The end."
5,Best Season YET!,Matt Smith is amazing. That's all I need to say. :D I will miss the Ponds 4 EVAR. They better be brought back for the 50th Anniversary.
5,"The Doctor, 'Nuff said","This season is so far a lot faster moving than the last ones.It is still very good though.If you liked the last season, Matt Smith or Doctor Who in general, then this season will be something you will definitely like to watch and should be watched to keep up with all the newest companions twists and story in general!"
5,Doctor Who Review,I love this show and Asylum of the Daleks was certainly not a disappointment! Easily the best video I've ever bought.
4,the doctor,As always another epic tale of good vs. Evil. Besides who doesn't like time travel and dinosaurs. I've been watching the doctor since I was a child in the UK. I absolutely love the new take on the new Doctor. I can't wait till Christmas for more. Please bring back that Master and the Doctors daughter. More River please.
4,Odd and fun.,"Odd and quirky enough to have been the plot of a classic Doctor Who, but with a bit of the more modern edge."
4,Lost in space!,"The Alpha Control Manual was lots of fun and I enjoyed my trip back in time to my childhood. Looking back, I have to say that Lost In Space was the seed from which I have enjoyed sci fi over 45 years. The book is worthwhile if you want to read some things about the show, the ship and the crew as well as the imaginary time-line in which it was all set."
1,Stupid Schematics,"Just a bunch of stupid schematics, floor plans, diagrams of the various consoles, and even costume design. Nothing about the show. Why would anyone be interested in schematics to a non-existent spaceship?"
5,An Outstanding Historical Book,"This book is not outstanding just because it gives valuable information about the historical events or characters but also for describing events like a story-teller. The book has 12 topics for different historical characters or events. All of them are marvelous. But especially, the part that describe the death of Tolstoy as a drama just made me write this review. This is the best historical book that I have ever read."
3,"A Little Sparse on Details, but good","This book has excellent test-taking tips and multiple practice questions and tests, but the in-depth review of history does not seem too in-depth at all. It glances over many details that are likely to appear on the AP World Test, and therefore I would not recommend taking the test based on the knowledge in this book alone. It gives a good overall review of history though, and would be good coupled with a textbook or perhaps another review book. The review of history is also somewhat dry, although some might like it that way."
5,Great Book,This is a great book and learning tool. It was great to order and it showed up on schedule too!
2,was really excited...,"Recieved in the mail with a busted lid, really disappointing. Don't ship costumers open product...maybe I'll reorder a bottle so I can try it."
4,"Cry, blow nose, tear up, question your sanity.","LOLOL... sweating... ouch ouch ouch...whooooooooooo. Seriously, dude!I decided to look up the Insanity Sauce after having knowingly put 5 drops in a bowl of cabbage soup;that's how I found these reviews. Why did I think that it was not going to be as hot this time!?!I have never tasted anything this hot and yet I cannot stop eating it! As everyone recommends, dilute, dilute, dilute or prepare for pain. I love heat and have had hot sauces and chili sauces all over... this is way hotter than anything else.Recommendations:- Don't do any of those ""dare"" type things where you drink this for money or to impress your friends. You could need medical attention.- Keep away from kids.- You may want hide it when relatives come to cook or they may think that it is one of those hot sauces that is all hype and dump a bunch in the chili."
4,"Will drive you crazy, but the kid loves it","My 18 month-old daughter loves pushing this toy around the house. It makes a bit of noise - enough to drive you crazy after 30 minutes, but it's really not that bad. And I think the noise is part of what keeps her entertained.Also - she has banged it into the wall a few times, and it has yet to leave a mark."
4,So cute!,This is the cutest popper I've ever seen. Our 1 year old daughter loves it. Only problem is the stick comes out but is easy to put back. Guess I could use some glue :)
4,Greatest QB Release Of 2004,"Infamous Mobb's second album ""Blood Thicker Than Water, Vol 1"" brings more of the hungry street ish we've come to know on Special Edition. The album starts out hot with the blazing tracks; ""Greenbacks"" and ""Empty Out (Reload)"". The Mobb continues to bring raw street hop throughout the CD although on some tracks the production comes up short or the hook doesn't fit their style entirely well. The Bonus DVD includes interviews with the members who unravel some of their memorable experiences & memories growing up in the hood. For years Mobb Deep were uncontestedly the illest crew in QB but 2004 will forever be remembered as the year they got overshadowed by the Infamous Mobb."
4,An impressive survey.,"Like many of Bastion Press's books, Arms & Amror is a great survey of armament possibilities within the core rules of the D&D system. From mundane weapons and armor to extensive lists of magic qualities, Arms & Armor delivers a heck of a lot of material. Optional rules adds are also included, such as armor as DR, divine items, and legendary weapons (ala Unearthed Arcana or The Game Mechanics' legendary items books). As this shows, some of that material is compiled from other d20 sources, which is part of what makes the OGL great, while other bits are original. It's not totally 3.5e compliant, especially in the monster section, but this is a relatively minor point. I'm not sure anyone needs this book, but it cannot fail to add spice and variety to your d20 fantasy campaign."
4,Cute & Cuddly,"This monkey puppet is very cute, soft & cuddly. My only issue is that in order for the monkey to make noise, you have to press under his chin/chest area. Other puppets that I have purchased make noises when you open & close their mouths."
1,Great effects but too short,I bought this because my sons needed sound effects for a project. But while the animal sounds were extremely authentic they were much too short to be useful. At just a few seconds we had to tape the same short sound over and over which just didn't work out well. So if you're needing sound effects this CD isn't for you.
1,SONY DCR TRV250 Defective,"I purchased a Sony DCR TRV 250 digital camera new about 15 months ago. I took excellent care of it and suddenly the LCD went blank during my Ph.D. graduation ceremony (""a SONY Moment""). In this state of disrepair, the camera is not worth a nickel. I am very frustrated and angry with SONY as they have not responded to my email inquiries. After finally reaching them by phone, I was told SONY repairs would cost approximately $280 with shipping. I don't think so! I feel very deceived. SONY is now ""unplugged"" in my house - for good.It is my understanding that there is a class action suit in progress and I am also notifying the Attorney General in New York. It's too bad SONY could not stand by their products and quit gouging customers for using cheap electronics. The real question here is whether or not SONY is committed to sound moral and ethical principles regarding the sale of defective products."
4,First Camcorder,"I researched this product before I bought and it has had a lot of great reviews. Basically, for the price, it's a great camera for first time buyers who want a decent digital camera.Sony makes good products - I looked at other cameras of the same type and others looked cheaper.Biggest mistake when using: I used nightshot to try and capture some Vegas lights (at night of course) and everything was green! Don't use nightshot unless your in an unlit area - you'll be able to tell through the viewfinder if your getting a picture or not -That was my only problem and that is why I gave it four stars - they don't mention the color problem in the manual. Otherwise great first camera at a great price."
1,Beware of Factory Defect,Sony camcorders have a factory defect that the ccd screen goes black when in record mode after a few tapes of use. I was asked to pay $270 to fix it. Beware.. there are thousands of such reported problems on this and other camcorder review sites. I would suggest that you read them before buying a Sony product.
4,software,I bought this camcorder for my wife to save her using my Sony PDX-10. I also did not want one that was tiny. My main beef with it and with my PDX-10 is the software to connect it to a PC stinks. This company could learn a lot from Apple. It was not my incompetence I discovered a whole message board of others making the same complaint. Fot the gentleman wo lost his CD don't bother replacing it buy some third party software.One advantage of the D8 format is you can use cheap tapes (my daughter records her theater practise sessions) and you can use it for old Hi-8 tapes.
2,I was disappointed,"After purchasing this camcorder, I found out that the USB Streaming did not work with our Macintosh G4 Powerbook. You have to get the TRV 350 model if you want to use USB Streaming with a Mac - something the salesman did not tell us. Otherwise you have to purchase extra stuff (card, cable, etc.) for iLink. Also the ImageMixer software that comes with this camera is a total nightmare! After several hours I still was unable to make it do anything I wanted it to do. Yes, there's a manual for the software, but it was impossible to find any answers in it.I loved the camera itself and all of its features, but I took it back to get something that would work better for me."
1,Does not work!,"It doesn't work. Was delivered by UPS to wrong address. Altogether, it makes me hesitate to buy any other devices on Amazon. I am still waiting to make sure I get a full refund. UPS should be responsible for replacing it."
2,Poor reliability,"The camcorder is nice, with accpetable picture quality. However mine started giving error c:31:42 just after 7 months, though I haven't used much. I checked the mannual and it states that the error codes starting with the letter 'c' can be fixed by users.I followed the possible solutions but wasn't able too fix the problem. I called sony they told me that it needs service and they will charge US $216 for labor.This is totally unacceptable for a camcorder which is worth around $330.I just can't believe that a company like sony is charging 2/3 of the original price to fix an error which according to their own mannual can be fixed by users. I would now think twice before buying any sony product.My advice is to buy an extended warranty when you buy a sony camcorder or look for a differnt brand like samsung etc."
4,Sony DCRTRV250,"I used this camera an average of 1x a month. I recently went on vacation and the screen went blank. Contacted sony... link to a texas website where they will charge over $260.00, decided to open it and see if anything was loose. I removed the chip that is attached to the zoom lens and found some minor dust, blow it put it back, turn the cam on and wala! working, and I was gonna buy another one.I gave this cam a 4 since the actual camera does a very good job. The software is very basic, to me was easy to use, but not good to keep your memories. I have an ATI all in wonder with Pinnacle and ulead and with that my camera is a 5 stars.The cam is also an excellent webcam, crystal clear, but I wouldnt use the usb to transfer 1hr film with a slow system and small Hard Drive."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA OR ANY OTHER SONY!,"Similar to one of the other reviews I just read, my camera quit working after 1 year. The image through the view finder became distorted and that's what it recorded when I tried to use it.I had only used the camera a hnadful of times, and I kept it in it's case. Sony has a 90 day warranty for labor, and a 1 year warranty for parts. I was told it would be $290 for parts and labor, but since I was still under warranty for parts, it would only be $233! What a deal!I've had problems with other Sony products as well (stereo receiver) so I'm done with them!"
1,"Black Screen Problem, June 8, 2005","""There is no picture or a black screen appears in the viewfinder or LCD when attempting to record.""Knowledge Article C116445====================================Well, this happened to my camera after 15 months after very light use.Minimium repair charge is $269."
2,Good camera for price but beware of repair costs.,"When I first purchased this camcorder I was very happy with what you could do with it, but within less than a year of use I could no longer charge the battery or download my video into my computer(the problem being the camera and not the battery, the charger, or fire wire). I have been very careful with this camera, never dropped it, wet it, or banged it. It was always carefully put away when not in use, so I know my treatment of this camera was not at fault, but now I have a useless piece of equipment and in order to repair it my only option is to send it to Sony for a minimum charge of $232.00 plus shipping. There is no authorized repair center in my area or even within a 150 miles of where I live and those repair centers that Sony listed will not touch this camera. If you do purchase this camera I recommend also purchasing an extended warranty. I wrongly assumed that Sony would manufacture a product that would last more that 10 months!"
3,Bad Customer Service,"I had my camcorder for 4 months. I used it 3-4 times when I first got it. Than when I went on vacation (only days after the 90 warrantly expired) it did not work. When I called customer service when I got home, they told me it would cost $290 to fix it. I am still hashing it out with them, however they have not offered me an acceptable response so far. Basically I paid $360 for a camera I was only able to use 3-4 times, and now it's worthless. Even worse, if you read the troublshooting guide you will find that you will have problems when you take the camera to another climate. They claim it can adjust after 1 hour, but mine did not. Needless to say, I did not get to record any footage from my vacation...and I'm very unhappy with Sony."
1,Buyer Beware - Get the Extended Warranty!,"Do NOT even THINK about buying a Sony without also purchasing the best extended warranty available! It was a good camera while it lasted - exactly 13 months! The manufacturer's warranty is one year, and alas, I did NOT purchase an extended warranty. I took good care of it, and always stored it in a case. I used it rarely, to tape wrestling meets and other school events. I tried to use it the other day for the first time in a few months, and the LCD shows no picture - only horizontal lines. Sony's answer is for me to ship it to Texas, AFTER I prepay a flat rate fee of $269 (plus tax, of course)! A brand new one can be purchased for less than that on sale! Bummer."
3,"Good, but for digital I prefer MiniDV","The picture and sound are crisp and good. The color was washed out and could be more accurate. The manual and camera lacked what I needed to compensate for washed out color. The motor noise didn't appear in the video, but was annoying for indoor recording and operation. The zoom button wasn't the easiest to reach.If you've used Sony camcorders in the past, I imagine that you will be satisfied. But, ultimately, I wanted something smaller, quieter, and uses MiniDV."
4,"Convenient, low cost business cards","Rather than pay a local or online printing press to create a generic card, I wanted to design my own. This allows you to change your business card at any time, and not have 100s laying around that are useless.NOTE:Make sure you choose the Card Stock or Business Card setting in your printer options. This makes sure the toner is heated up enough and binds to the heavy paper. I didn't do this on my first print and the toner wiped off of the cards."
5,"Susan Graham, Songs of Reynaldo Hahn","Stunning. The sticker on the front of the CD (New York Times quote) says it all: ""breathtaiking and unforgettable!""."
5,DON'T WAIT -- RUN TO GET THIS ALBUM,"Sometimes hyperbole can ruin the very thing it seeks to enhance, but I find it difficult to come up with enough words of praise for this astonishing album and the two artists who perform on it. Susan Graham is one of the top five opera singers in the world today -- her artistry and sensitivity to the music and text of what she sings is simply unmatched. That's why such an album as this is so extraordinary. Hahn was once a jealously guarded secret by those ""in the know"" -- he's a delight, and, now that he's becoming more well known, to have an artist of Graham's stature share these pieces is a special event. Listen to the first cut, ""A Chloris""; if your heart doesn't melt into goo instantly, then it could be you're a deaf space alien. The whole disc is this lovely. I can't imagine that anyone listening won't be thrilled that they purchased it."
5,Essential for any vocal work fans,"This is very wonderful disc because there are many wonderful songs composed by Reynald Hahn. I don't know many of songs except ""Si mes vers Avaient des ailes"" (If my songs had wings), but all of them are very wonderful and charming. I can't speak French so much, but the sound of French is so beautiful! Susan Graham's voice is beautiful. I can't wait to hear her next lieder/chanson album. This one is very recommentable for anyone who loves beautiful music. It will make you feel so wonderful.ENJOY!"
3,Good but cheap,"I purchased this and it came fast that was awesome the sad part it came broken. They figured the lazy way was better; if it fits in the box it's good to go, but it apparently was not a good idea to bend it to fit. Well tape worked but i would rather have it in one piece when it shows up."
1,Cheesy beyond cheese,"Arrived with two if the tips broken off, despite being very well packaged. By the time Halloween night rolled around I think the rest of them had fallen off. Cheap price, but equally cheap quality."
5,fascinating,"This is the best book on identity I've read yet, because it's in the words of people for whom the issue was truly life and death. Though the book is scholarly enough to be an academic work, it is very readable because it is almost entirely first person accounts."
4,Great drills and concepts,Does a good job on explaining the basics of roller hockey instead of just using ice hockey skills. Good drill instructions for the coach. An item I wish was in place was the official roller hockey rules.
5,Great book for coaches,I recently started coaching roller hockey and this book has been a godsend. I use it constantly to plan practices and drills. It covers everything from specific skills to offensive and defensive strategy. You might want to have more specific books on some in depth subjects (e.g. goal tending) but this does a great job covering all the basics. I highly recommend it.
2,focus on drills and tactics,"Roller hockey is a nice book for a coach, with the focus on tactics and drills.This is NOT a book on stickhandling,skating en shooting instructions !"
5,Great service & product,This is exactly what I was looking for and it was a great price. I also got it very quickly. Couldn't be more pleased
1,"Throw away product, destroyed company","Have had 4 of these over the last 10 years; each worked for a while and then failed after two to four years. Fortunately we bought from a retailer with a replacement policy but it's a huge nuisance. I'm a management professor and I can tell you that the problem was probably an awful CEO nicknamed ""Chainsaw Al"" who ruined a number of formerly good companies including Sunbeam sadly. Though he was booted out in 1998, along with all the lives of workers he destroyed, he seems to have destroyed the culture of the company also. From their blankets, I would guess that it never recovered. For more info put Sunbeam and Chainsaw Al into a search engine or just go to Wilkapedia at [...p or Business Week at [...] May Chainsaw Al receive all that which he deserves in this life or the next.Sunbeam BW1211-030-596 Heated Electric Microplush Blanket, Full, Lagoon"
1,Terrible,"This electric blanket hasn't even lasted a year. I recieved it as a Christmas gift last year after my previous electric blanket that I had stopped working (it had lasted 7 years) Now when I turn on this blanket, even 30 minutes before climbing into bed, the bed is still as cold as it was when I turn the electric blanket on. I must say it is a big disappointment."
2,SUNBEAM GOOD FOR AYEAR THATS IT.,"I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH THE READERS I HAVE BOUGHT AT LEAST 4 SUNBEAM BLANKETS AS I HAVE COLD EXTREMETIES DUE TO MY DISORDER.SUNBEAM IS GOOD FOR ABOUT A YEAR,AND RIGHT AFTER YOU WASH IT.BUT IT QUICKLY RETURNS TOO NO HEAT.MY BUTTON ON HEAT CONTROL IS ON 8.WHEN I GOT IT THAT WOULD HAVE BURNED MY SKIN.NOW I AM FLIRTING WITH 9.DONT BUY SUNBEAM BLANKETS.THEY ARE GOOD FOR ABOUT AYEAR THAT IS IT.I KNOW I DID IT 3X TO BE SURE.NO MORE JUNK.SUNBEAM YOU USED TO BE A HOUSEHOLD NAME MY PARENTS SWORE BY.NOW WE THEIR CHILDREN SWEAR AT YOUR PRODUCT.LIKE SO MANY AMERICAN PRODUCTS TODAY YOU GOT CHEAP EXCEPT FOR PRICE.ALL THESE PEOLPE CANT BE WRONG COMING UP WITH SAME COMPLAINT."
1,Expensive for the 2 months it worked.,"I bought this last winter and it heated up great at first. With each successive week, the product would not get as hot as the previous week. About the third month into using this, it would only get slightly above room temperature. 70 bucks down the toilet. Don't bother buying these blankets folks, you're better off setting fire to your money. In the end I cut it up and used it for bird-cage lining.I never washed or moved it around too much for it to break that fast. I believe Sunbeam purposefully makes their items break fast. We need a class action law-suit.In the mean time, I'll be looking at electric blankets from 40 years ago if I can snag one. Yes, I have to go back that far in time to get something that works."
1,Stopped Working after 1 winter,I was going to buy this on Amazon but stumbled across this same model at a different store but cheaper. It was great last year during the winter and now this winter I took it out to use it again and the heat isn't as strong as it use to be and now only one side of the blanket works. I'll most likely but a different brand since all I hear about Sunbeam Blankets is that they die out or stop working.
1,Worthless For Electric Warmth,"I've tried this product 3 times, for three different beds, and every single one of them stopped working within a few weeks: they did not heat at all, the connection to the blanket fell out every time you moved and you'd have to reconnect it and replug it and hopelessly hope; and the blanket itself did not suffice. I cannot believe that so many stores only stock this brand of warming blanket! Unbelievable! Go elsewhere to save yourself a major disappointment (and more chilly nights!)."
1,Good for a season...,"I have purchased three Sunbeam Warming blankets over the last four to five years, and one thing is consistent...for the first year, it works like a charm. However, after the first year, the quality and consistency of heat begins to diminish exponentially.I really never paid attention to the number of blankets I was buying, as I just would buy a new one if it was not heating properly. This year, I noticed that I have three queen sized heating blankets (one on the bed and the other two in bags that I have never gotten around to dropping off at GoodWill). Then it hit me, every 18 months, I am spending $139 for a blanket. Someone has to have a better quality blanket.Next year, the blanket on my bed should begin to go out (as Sunbeam is SO consistant). So I will purchase another brand!"
3,"Blanket ok, but missing functionality",product works ok but does not have pre-heat settingand no automatic 10 hr shutoff. Dont forget toturn it off manually.
2,not good at all....,"The first 2 albums ""Zipless"" and ""Two to tango"" are really good!.. I thought this cd will be better than the others... but, not good at all! ..."
3,Disappointed Fan...,"After ""Slow to Burn"", which had a solid sense of mood from beginning to end, and ""Zipless"", which had a novel musical take on poetry, ""Plutonium Glow"" was kind of a let down. I listened to it straight through with my headphones tight against my head, and the mood was just not really there, those breathless Virgin Island visuals...and the instrumentals were fairly thin compared to the richness of ""Slow to Burn"". Haven't heard Dear John Coltrane yet, but this album has kept me from purchasing it right away."
5,Deborah (You Rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!),This is one great cd there are so manygreat song's on this cd Like Cry TonightI Can't and much more. Deborah really tookher time to make this cd and it really stand'sout and show's in her music.
2,"Great voice, not as good as earlier albums.","I love Deborah Gibson's voice on this album, but the songs are not as good as her earlier work."
5,HER BEST ALBUM!!!,"This album is amazing. Every song soars vocally and has emotional content behind the fabulous voice and excellent musical arrangement. The only quam I have about this album is the duet ""Cry Tonight."" Not only do I not like the song, but the other woman's voice is obnoxious. This song and the remix of ""ONly in my Dreams"" should have been left off this album. Other than that it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. You'll love it!! Her voice has never been so beautiful."
5,Real Class,"Deborah really reaches her prime on this album. I've often thought that ""Think With Your Heart"" was her best work. But I think her voice was even more mature and smooth on this album. It's difficult for me to critique the songs individually, because each one is really well done. This CD just radiates class and sophistication."
3,music?,"After all, what is music? Is it melody? Sound? Noise ?I don't think I've ever heard a record that makes the wholedefinition of music such a question of urgency. Its sometimes very melodic in a low-key manner, then it exlodes into just weird and far-out noise to land again in harmony and melody. But the way the melodic parts are played has a kind of eerie feel, as if the melodies was played at great pain, like a madman trying to surpress his insanity. You hear a lot of noise from the musicians such as breathing and spitting. In fact they have managed to turn a saxophone into a rythmic instrument. Since I've seen them live in Sweden I can tell you that this is done by holding your knee into the saxophone and making the sound sometimes ""leek"" out while jumping around on the stage. If you really like names such as Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane in his later days, this is for you. But if you like jazz to be played at your cocktailparties, then beware !"
5,still a Great Sound and provides much enjoyment,"Most today won't recognize the name, but Herb was and still is one of my very favorite musicians to spend time with. A great sound, wonderful beat, beautiful trumpet, this work provides music to enjoy!"
3,Common Sense in a Written Format,This book contains nothing that I haven't read in several other manuals and guides. Most of the material was just common sense guides and nothing specific to the Appalachian Trail. I donated my book to the library instead of allowing it to take up space on my shelves.
2,Not as good as I had hope for.,Have been reading many books about hiking the AT and this one was not as good as hoped for after reading it. Not very informational and questioned some of the recommendations and suggestions.
3,Mediocre Literature,"I personally have bought every book possible concerning the Appalachian Trail while planning my thru-hike. However, if you are concerned about money, or wasting time reading for that matter, I would advise not to buy any of Jan Curran's books. I have read all three of his on the AT and have found them very boring, to the point of difficult to finish. Other books out there are much worthwhile.Nonetheless, this book would be voted as the best of the three, with decent general purpose advice for long distance hikes. But there is nothing unique about the information. Pick up any hiking book and it will provide the same background. It just seems to skim the surface."
2,disappointing,"Just as disappointing as Curran's ""TheAppalachian Trail: A Journey of Discovery."" Much is promised, but little is delivered."
4,Fits its purpose,"I found this book to be helpful in offering specific information about things that are encountered on the AT itself. Curran writes the book like many other hiking books offering general advise, but he keeps it aimed at the AT. It is a wonderful starting point for getting information about the trail."
4,Hiking the AT,"If you are at all interested in hiking any part of the Appalchian Trail, I would suggest that this book be part of your resources. Hiking the trail isn't a matter of pulling on your shoes and talking a walk. This is a true ""test of your inner self"" hike on a real forest trail. There are any number of things you need to know before setting out.The family and I are going to take a day hike later this summer. None of us are long-distance hikers with the exception of the granddaughter-in-law. We are using this book to discuss where we are going and what we will be taking along. Our ages range from one year to 71 so we'll need all the help we can get. The book has provided much help in our discussions."
5,Great advice.,"Excellent guide for getting ready for the trail - buying gear, food, expectations, etc, etc. Glad I got this one!"
3,Not a round bolster!,"Perhaps I didn't read the description closely enough, but I was surprised when this bolster arrived because it isn't round as I thought I'd read the description to say it was. It is actually flat on one side so it doesn't roll under the client to adjust for position--it takes more effort to move due to the flat side; it doesn't ""scoot"" well."
2,Not as great as others,"Its actually a little too small. I use it as a lumbar support by putting it behind my knee so my hips can posteriorly tilt. The circumference of the bolster is too small to make probably a regular average person's back straighten out. Another bad thing is that its too soft. It might be 6 inches diameter but it'll be like 3 with your legs on it.Pros: Probably can be used for other thingsCons: Too small, too soft."
4,OK but not enough firmness,Would be 5 stars if it had more firmness. I'm not really sure about the quality of the leather...or is it vinyl?
4,Good bolster,I use this during all of my massages. Easy to clean and serves it's purpose well. Long lasting and well made.
3,works but a little stiff,i imagine i may invest in more bolsters as i start my practice--but i've found this one a bit stiff--will do for now.
1,Copco Travel Mug Line-up problems,Although the materials used in this travel mug are fine the problem lies in the fact that you cannot line-up the mouth piece properly with the handle. It did not matter if left or right handed.
1,Copco 16 oz,The plastic portion around the bottom of the cup pulled away allowing water into the outer shell of the cup.
4,What the experts say...,"""...worth owning and reading: the text is valuable, the illustrations are magnificent, and the production overall is excellent. The Mediterranean Diet will enrich the library of any educated person, not only those with medical backgrounds or Mediterranean roots...The book presents the health effects of diet with a simplicity that does not seriously compromise scientific accuracy, and it treats the various Mediterranean cultures with respect...""

2,No adapter for Advanced Elements spring valve,"There was no suitable adapter for Advanced Elements kayak spring valves, so I returned it."
5,Good book to learn more about our Oneness with the universe!,I appreciated David alot for his courage to come out and say how he feels now about these matters. To claim to be a reincarnation of the energy of someone famous in the past takes alot of courage and opens one up to the criticizers. Our quantum connection with oneness is also reinterated well in The Yoga of Time Travel by physicist Fred Alan Wolfe. It is nice to know these people are corroborating each other now with this information about the universe. Hopefully people will get out of fear inculcated in us in the past of direct information and we can come to better appreciate how we are eternal beings working in an expansive universe!! David also sheds alot of awareness on questions raised by the DaVinci Code materials nowadays!
1,fraud,wilcock is not cayce. cayce was a humble man who cared not for money. he helped all who asked and he was accurate. wilcock is none of these things and has a HORRIBLE track record with his predictions. his claims have ranged from alien disclosure in 2000 to the end of the financial crisis in 2008. question him on his website and you get banned. imo he is a charlatan taking financial advantage of those seeking answers. that he would try to sully cayce's legacy in doing so is shameful. please do your research before trusting thid guy. there is plenty of info out there about him as he has been selling his snake oil for many years now. if you seek answers and truth then look within. the worst thing you can do on that path is turn to those with their ego issues and personal agendas.
5,That hits the spot!,"If your a diabetic and looking for something sweet, this will do the trick! I am a candy freak and this was terrific!"
3,Functional Garden Hose,This is a great hose for light watering/needs. It's lightweight and bend easily causing flow issues very easily. If you're looking to buy one to water plants and the occasional window this is a great buy!
2,Careful where you use this...,Within 1 day of using this hose it sprang a leak. We cut and repaired it. Then next day the same thing happened... And so forth. Seems the material is irresistible to rodents. They chew into it.
3,Got what I paid for,"It's a cheap hose and it is made cheaply. The hose leaks at the female end, but not enough to cause any real detriment. Overall, the hose gets the job done for me. The only thing I use it for is cleaning my bike and my car. If I were a frequent user of a hose (i.e someone who gardens) I would not purchase this product."
1,Good for shooting water right through the connector,"I got this hose.. I was excited.. but turning the hose on and off causes me to get soaked.. because water sprays right out of where the hose connects to the spout... not because it's not fastened.. the water doesn't shoot out of the top of where they meet, but instead it shoots out right through various parts of the hose connector itself...this was a bad experience for me and i don't recommend it for others."
1,the hose is crap,"The hose burst after two months of use. The hole in the hose shot water into the air for a few hours before we noticed what had happened. Do not Do not buy this product regardless of price. Once I get my water bill, it will have cost me more then getting a heavy duty commercial hose. It is not an outdoor hose. Next time I will spend the money. This thing is crap."
1,Blackberry case,"On the surface this case looks great but after two months of use, the plastic belt bracket broke off.The bracket is very poorly made."
1,Not For 8703e,"This product did not work with my Blackberry Model 8703e. It held the BB fine but the proximity sensor did not work. Therefore my backlight stayed on when I put the device in the holster. This did not save my battery life as intended. Also this meant that my device didn't not vibrate when in the holster, since it didn't realize it was in the holster. Instead it rang like it was out of the holster at all times.I was not refunded my shipping costs for receiving this or for shipping it back.8703e MODEL OWNERS BEWARE."
2,Read George R R Martin Instead,"I picked up this book because I'd heard that Goodkind was a Robert Jordan clone. I figured that since Jordan wasn't writing like Jordan then maybe someone who was would be worth reading. Unfortunately WFR is more like the Jordan we've all come to know and hate. Richard has no balls and is so obssessed with being a ""sensitive man"" that he's bland and uninteresting. His love at first sight relationship with Kahlan is cliched. This book was so dull I couldn't finish it."
3,"Hey, haven't I already read this.....?","I read Wizard's First Rule shortly after it came out and enjoyed it, and, for the most part, its sequels. But here's the rub: I just finished the first Wheel of Time book by Robert Jordan; Wizard's First Rule and its sequels are so derivative of Wheel of Time that I'm shocked that Jordan didn't sue. (The first Wheel of Time book was published in 1990; Wizard's First Rule was published in 1994.)I'm not going to go into the parallels because it would take a week. I'd recommend reading Jordan first, and don't read them close together; so many things are so similar that you'll become hopelessly confused."
1,buyer beware,"Though the package and the write-up states that this product will replace the Remington R200 head, it does not replace the Remington R200S. I'm not sure why such a large difference between the R200 and the R200s, but it doesn't even come close to fitting. And of course, after having to totally destroy the heavy plastic casing the head comes in, there is absolutely no way of packing it back up for return. Buyer be aware!"
1,Poo,"I had an old R200s shaver and contrary to the advertisement, this is NOT the right replacement head.Trying to force it in broke my razor. Nuff said."
3,Cigar Caddy: OK...not great (but price & delivery were fine),"The Cigar Caddy 3540 is an OK way to safely transport your cigars. It is designed to hold 3 rows of 5 cigars each - for a total of 15 cigars. There's a layer of foam padding on the bottom, and between each layer, to protect your cigars. Your cigars must be thinner than 48's to get 5 across in a row. Also, the Humidifier on top is small and weak. You'll want to add additional humidification to the case. The locking clasps fall off during opening. But, once you lock them down, they stay in place. The box is quite sturdy. Price and delivery were great."
3,Not the size as mentioned,"I was disappointed with the way the package was shipped. I wanted a strainer smaller than 3 inches in diameter, and this one would have fit the bill, but to my further dismay, it turned out to be slightly more than 3 inches! Otherwise the mesh is strong. The lip is a useful feature to prevent you having to hold the strainer in one hand with a squirming baby in the other!"
4,GARDENS OF OBSESSIONS,I OWN A LANDSCAPING COMPANY AND I AM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR ORIGINAL IDEAS.THIS BOOK HAS GARDENS FROM A FANTASY LAND. BEAUTIFUL PICTURES OF BREATHTAKING GARDENS. THIS BOOK IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ENJOY BEAUTY...NOT JUST GARDENING.
2,doesnt work as well,it does a good job of moving the wire shielding away from the dielectric but other than than its useless. faster just to use my fingers
1,Poor Quality,Just bought it and do not recommend buying it at all. The stitching was badly done. The prints are horrible and there were no response from the seller when I complained of the damage item. Go to your nearest Modells!
3,novelty,The ball is very light and feels like it is for novelty purposes. Does seem like it would be worth takes outside. I don't want to test this ball for it would be complete waste to get it ripped. Cool ball otherwise
2,Colorful but didn't last long,"The balls are very colorful with all the country flags and are easy to use, but definitely NOT for a middle school of rambuncious students. We purchased several balls beginning of April. By May, they were deflated and torn. Need to be replaced again. I would repurchase for home use, but not for a school environment.Seller was great though. Very helpful."
5,EXCELLENT AMAZON.COM SELLERS!!,EXCELLENT AMAZON.COM SELLERS!! THESE SELLERS ARE THE BEST; THEIR CUSTOMER FOLLOWUP IS GREAT; THEY ARE SERIOUS RETAILERS WHO WANT TO PROVIDE THE BEST FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS; I WILL USE THEM AGAIN WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT; THANK YOU!
5,good stuff,"This brand is easy to dispense, as it does not clump up during the humid weather we have been having."
5,Good Deal,No acid problem. I take a teaspoon a day at breakfast by just putting a spoonful in my morning tea. I dissolves quickly and completely and has minimal aftertaste. Easy peasy way to get a good dose of Vit C.
3,Okay,"The quality of this vit. C seems to be decent. However, after only 3 months, the powder started turning brown, indicating oxidization. For this quantity of vit. C, they should include an oxygen absorbing packet, or maybe sell it in sets of smaller containers to prevent it from going bad."
2,Arrived already slightly oxidized,"When I opened the bottle and compared it to what was left in another bottle from the same manufacturer, the new one from Amazon had a slight yellowish tint to it, compared to the more whitish color in the older, almost used-up other bottle. So I take that to mean that even though the expiration date of the new Amazon bottle has a long way to go, the new Vit C is **inferior** and I got ripped off and would not order it from Amazon again. Of course, Amazon does not offer a comment opportunity directly to the seller as it does with its new & used sellers, only an opportunity to comment on the quality of the packaging. Big deal."
5,My favorite C,"So many Vitamin C powders have an awfully bitter or powerfully sour taste that makes them tough to take. This one is slightly salty from the sodium, but much more palatable than the others and the sodium ascorbate form of C is reputedly easier for the body to metabolize."
3,good initiation,"A good initiation for a new user. Does not contain a lot more than what you have to learn to pass your licence in Australia...Some interesting points in the range question, day and night."
2,Doesn't work well for my Tacoma,"I received this cargo net today and the concept and product are good except for the attachment system. This net requires multiple connections (at least eight) to the pickup bed and I found the hooks provided to be a bad design for my Tacoma. The only places they attach to the bed are the four tie downs that came with the Tacoma and they don't stay hooked to them very well. They are bulky plastic. Metal ""S"" hooks would work much better. The ""D"" rings supplied were cheap and useless to me. I thought about returning the net but decided to go to Home Depot and buy parts to make the attaching of the net to the bed work. Had I known all of this prior to purchase, I would not have purchased the net."
3,"A ""Should-Read""","Different approach to the welfare-system. Long term study of three women struggling in NYC, one immigrant, one born and raised in Brooklyn, and one drug addict. Not comparable to NICKLE AND DIMED, but sheds a lot of light on Presidential Hopeful, GIULIANI."
5,This is the drill that will last!,"My husband has bought a few cheaper drills over the years only to have them break, malfunction, or sizzle-out after a short period of time. He wanted this drill for Christmas. Of course, all I could see at first was the price-tag. I'm happy to report, he's using this drill all the time and it works great, has not had one problem, and he has no buyers remorse (nor do I)! My brother-in-law built his home and this was the only drill he used throughout the project. You can imagine the use it had over the last 18 months and it is still going strong. I guess you get what you pay for. If you use cordless drills often and don't want to hassle with the $39 drills that break or quit working then this is the one for you. Keep in mind, these are the type of quality drills that contractors buy. We're happy with the purchase."
2,Bad Batteries,"The drill was great...lots of torque (1.5"" auger bits through 3"" of wood no problem. Now 2.5 years later, both battery packs are dead and will not hold a charge. Replacements are $70 each (it came with 2) making the cost to own this thing about $70/yr. This is pathetic. I think the Ni-MH battery has poor life in low temps because I have not used this that much over the last year, but it is outside in my garage. Anyway, a $260 drill shouldn't need $140 in batteries every 2 years."
2,Poor Battery life,This is my fourth Makita cordless and I am very disappointed with how long the batteries have lasted. It is about 1 1/2 years old and used 2 or 3 times a week on average. The batteries do not hold a charge as long as they should. My 8 year old 14 volt with the original batteries can outlast this guy. And mine was a specail deal with 3.0 amp batteries.The drill it self is great and works very well. The repeatability of the clutch is very good. If it wasn't for the batteries going south so soon I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars.
5,Outstanding,"If you like flamenco type music, spanish guitar, or ""new age"" as this has been described (whatever that is), I would highly recommend this album. I personally really like flamenco type music, in this instance fused with other world sounds, and the result is exceptional. Listen to the samples if you must, but I really don't see how you can go wrong here, unless you don't like the genre. I have also seen them live and would highly recommend paying them a visit in person if you have the opportunity, as they are excellent live. Cheers!"
4,A great delight!,"I have to say I enjoyed this Jethro Tull tribute CD more than some of JT's own offerings of late! I also agree with the previous reviewer's comments regarding the accents on the CD but I must point out that they add to the enjoyment rather than detract. The songs range from straight up covers to completely reworked renditions that are sometimes hard to tell what Tull song is being done! If you are a Tull fan you certainly should enjoy this CD. It is also a stark contrast to the other Tull tribute CD, ""To Cry You A Song."" The other is more similar in nature to the songs done by Tull while this CD stretches the nature much farther (the rather middle eastern feel of the ""Aqualung"" rendition is quite a departure and the use of a female vocal on ""Only Solitaire"" and ""Nursie"" is wonderful). As a bonus we are treated to a live recording of Clive Bunker, Glen Cornick, and John Evans sitting in with a band to perform ""We Used to Know."" This CD is a great delight...get it!"
2,Almost but not quite?!?!?!,"Well, I can almost agree with Arkansas. Good but, its missing something. Updates most likely. It's like buying a old bottle of wine and you pour, and the nose is vinager... All in all, nice try, better luck next time."
5,belkin 25 ft snagless cable,this is a nice cable perfect size for short distants and easy to tell from these others i highley recamend it
3,A bit out of date but relevant,This book was written in 2000 and the author even admits being hesitant about technology including Power Point. So don't go looking for this book to find a way to utilize the internet.The general premise of the book is enough to help you determine if you want to be a speaker. It also includes a good point. You should be qualified in a field to start speaking. A janitor shouldn't be trying to teach leadership skills to Fortune 500 CEO's.
4,Hispanics & Blacks having fun & no crime--what a concept!!!,"I have seen the movie numerous times and enjoy it more & more with each viewing. The 4 characters are funny, watch each others back and have a good time without having to hurt anybody. Their adventures crashing the party, getting arrested and dancing at the club are funny. I enjoyed the positive aspects of the film like whether to go to college or not, just be yourself instead of someone you're not and not to judge people on appearance alone. My favorite character was Vinny/Fernando and his mannerisms when dealing with others. The funniest bits were the ugly girlfriend contest and dropping the quarter at the x-rated booth. I highly recommend this film. It is nice to see a movie where the minorities are not treated like thieves and thugs. This movie is a gem."
4,Very small labels,"Labels are very small (read description carefully).I knew I wasn't getting big labels but even though I mentally measured this, I thought they were bigger.If you are looking for the regular labels, these are not it. I was able to fit name, address and even a small design, but the font is super small and I only use them to show our return address.If you want to have fancy labels, make sure to get a bigger size."
5,So easy to use,Great price and easy to print. Had a lot of mailings to do and I could not find a better price.
2,Too high on price,Labels worked great for my needs but the original price was 19.98 on sale for 9.98 so I bought it without checking around. Checked today and Walmart is 7.44
5,Great labels!,"Great labels for mailing, marking things like jars, freezer containers and more. Avery makes some decent stuff. Never had a problem with their products."
2,Jam in my printer,"I have purchase these labels 2 different times and I will never buy them again. I have an HP photosmart C7200 series printer and every time I feed a page of these labels through it, small pieces of the lablel paper come loose inside and end up jamming my printer. It is very frustrating when it takes over 1/2 hour to print half a page of labels, because of the jams. I have changed to white labels and they do not cause the same problem."
1,THESE ARE **NOT** CLEAR!!,"These labels are NOT clear. They are ""frosted"" looking unless you are using them on already white or ivory colored paper. I just hung up from Avery and this IS the best product they have for ink jet printing, in terms of clear labels, however the word ""frosted"" came from Avery as they were describing the issue. They said if you use it on anything ""colored"" it will appear frosted.The cover of the product envelope shows a label on a tannish paper. It does not appear frosted on that. I explained I really and truly needed CLEAR labels. They did not have any alternate product to offer, and so I am getting a refund and mailing them the unused labels (they will reimburse shipping also).What a pain!! Now, to search for some truly clear labels that don't cost $60 per package!"
4,Easy to Use Labels,"I have used these labels for several personal mailing projects (anniversary party invitations, graduation announcements, return address labels) and they are easy to use. You can set up the template easily in Microsoft Word.Two drawbacks:1) You can't rerun the sheet through the printer if you don't use all the labels on the first printing. This is because when you use the easy peel feature, the backing gets bent and will jam the printer if you try to run it through a second time. So any unused labels on a sheet are wasted.2) The labels don't disappear well enough on colored envelopes. The labels have a matte finish that shows up very visably on colored paper."
4,A little more opaque than I expected,"I bought these labels to create labels for all my pantry canisters. The canisters themselves are clear, so I wanted something that wouldn't stand out too much. On the plus side, I like that they have stood up to the perils of coming in and out of the pantry many times, often with hands covered in flour or other baking by products: they have stayed securely in place and not started to peel. On the negative side is only that I was expecting something that was a little more transparent, since they are being sold as clear. Instead they are more translucent. I think this would be less of a problem if they were being stuck on a solid colored surface (like an envelope), but on a clear canister it's a little more obvious."
4,Not clear on colored envelopes,"These are basic mailing labels but I expected them to be clear (like gift wrap tape) on my blue envelopes for a baby shower, but alas they are more just like regular tape. Easy to use with a mail merge."
1,A waste of film,"I'm sorry, but this movie was NOT good at all. There were some moments where I chuckled, but this movie really was WOOOOOOO TERRIBLE. Wait for it to come on TV."
3,alright,"this movie had some of the same ideas of booty call,just different plot.but i think why this movie reminded me of that is cause tommy davidson was in booty call i think"
4,This is a hillarious comedy,"""Woo"" is funny, incliding it has the cast from ""The Proud Family."" (Tommy Davidson, Paula Jai Parker.) I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't see the rest of what it was rated for go I give **** (4 out of 5)."
5,Woo,"I bought a used CD, looked like new. The movie played wonderfully. I personally love this movie. Jade Pinkett is stunning and the entire cast is hilarious. A must see."
1,PLEASE JADA...,"Remember Set it Off? Jason's Lyrics? (Even Scream 2?) What happened?Whatever did, please don't go there again. Next time a script like ""Woo"" comes along, run for the hills!"
1,Unbelievably stupid,"All the hype that this film generated made me feel that I was going to be in for a funny and intelligent film. Instead I got a great headache. If you are the type of person who just had a lobotomy, well the film is for you. You will not have any problems with being overestimated with interesting dialogue or good acting. The plot is stupid and the actors didn't need the money that bad to do the movie. A dead tubeworm could have conceived and written and produce a better movie than this. Shame on you Jada!!"
4,It's was pretty good!,I really liked the movie a lot. That was one the best comedies I ever seen! And I really like Tommy Daidson he is my favorite actor!
4,WOOHOO!,"I never would have seen this movie if it didn't air on direct tv 20 times a day. I kept seeing pieces of it and it was enough to keep my interest. What I found is Woo is actually a funny and entertaining movie. I think Jada is sassy and smart so there! Tommy Davidson is great in this movie too and yes there is some cinematic chemistry here, it keeps u interested in their relationship. It is lighthearted and fun entertainment with some kewl music too. I laughed, I cried, i taped it!"
4,Great Street Life Stories,I bought this album a week ago and man its tight. The lyrics make you hair rise with the gritty quality of real life. If you like the first Bloods and Crips album check this out. And hey even if you don't check this album out. And for people who want to learn what its like to grow up in the hood forget Boyz N The Hood. This is the closest you'll ever want to get to gang life after listening to this. So come on and check out this album. After being in a gang in California I can tell you this album is as real as it gets besides bangin' in the streets.
4,Mirror is mirror,"Good, the pivot joint is really stiff making it hard to adjust, ( I guess I am required to write eight more words for this review before I can submit...)"
5,OK item. One or two little tricks needed.,"The mirror has a good-quality reflective surface and adequately heavy hardware.The ball joint was VERY stiff on my mirror. I sprayed it with WD40, but then I discovered that there are three screws that control the stiffness of the ball joint, and then it was very easy to adjust it exactly as needed.Now I can check my car lights in my garage easily and reliably, which is cool."
5,Convex mirror for travel trailer,"I needed a way to line up my truck's trailer hitch to the trailer so I bought this mirror mounted it to a 1""X2"" and bungee corded it to the crank shaft of the trailer and I can see the alignment perfectly. A lot less expensive than a camera and I can remove it when I am done and store it in my trailer."
4,My favorite,Use it daily and get many compliments from friends and acquaintances. Use to buy locally but cannot find any more.
5,nice perfume,Primo has been my favorite for years. It's inexpensive but it has gotten a little hard to find in stores so it's great to be able to buy online.
1,Surprised!,"I Google this and was surprised that it is still on market. Someone in the office just sprayed this perfume & all of us started choking. I instantly knew that it was Primo. I see 1 reviewer says that she has been wearing in for 20 yrs..I have been hating it just as long. When it 1st hit the shelves 20+yrs ago, my girlfriend at the time wore it..made me sick then and also today. I have a terrible headache. Sorry but that is one awful ""imposter""."
4,photopoly,"I enjoyed doing the photopoly game,adding my own photos but was never able to access the Ritz website for the game. I used the live chat, but still my photos wouldn't load. I used the print index on my own computer to produce photos smaller, I think, than those which Ritz offered. It was well received and I expect you will get more orders from those who saw it. I was able to load stamps with my grandchildren and the other sites seemed to work without difficulty except the photopoly one. Also the gameboard folds so caution folks about what is placed in the fold. I didn't have any luck placing the center strip in the game. Perhaps better directions would help those of us techology challenged."
5,Great gift,"We purchased this game for our daughter and son-in-law for their first anniversary. We started out by putting the earliest photo we had of the two of them on the first property and filled in the remainder of the properties with photo's from their wedding. It is a great way for them to remember this special time.Be prepared for a lot of work!! My wife and I spent several hours reviewing photo's, printing photo's and glueing photo's to make this project come together. it was worth it, but start early."
4,Lots of work!!!,"Every year my family draws names and we make gifts for each other. This year I had one of my brothers who can be a tough one. I had attempted two different gifts for him that didn't work, then I found and ordered this the week before Thanksgiving. The idea is great, but getting pictures to fit the little one inch square was tricky. We also printed some of our own sayings which smeared and for some reason didn't dry on the blank stickers that were with the game. This really is a great product and I am glad I did it.It would be great if the Photo-oploy company could make better preprinted stickers. The ones that had were so much easier to use, but most of them were a bit stupid. Both my teenage daughters and I were really stretching things to get it to work. Now that I have a boatload of pictures together, I may consider doing it again for another family member. But... definitely not a last minute project."
5,Great Idea for Memories,This product is a great idea ~ I used it for my first wedding anniversary. I put pictures around the game board like a storyboard of our first year =) It is a time consuming project ... a lot of cutting involved and glueing ~ but well worth it. The final product is fun. It really is like a personalized monopoly.
4,How to disqualify a jury,I should chime in with the other reviews here on Amazon that this is an interesting history of an interesting social phenomena and especially that it includes the very sort of excerpts that have made such a history clear. Many of those excerpts are from the relevant texts but also there are pertinent transcripts from governmental progress/regress regarding the issue of obscenity in the courts and congress. This book is an excellent source for such materials as well as an overall view of the history. Some of the chosen excerpts are hilarious in retrospect and the book is written to capitalize on this.
5,Ty Beanie Babies Tasha BACKYARDIGAN,son bellos muy duraderos y resistentes a mi hijo le encanta juega mucho con el durante el dia me encanta
4,Excellent product,Es un excelente y suave producto que genera bonitos sentimientos en los niños al jugar y de excelente ayuda a la hora de dormir.
3,"Too small, but great price!","Mu niece wanted this toy. I bought it but ended up being too small. I did not pay attention to the dimensions. No problem, though. It was cheap, but I would like to have the bigger option available.Quick delivery, no problem with seller! :)"
3,Yardigans Tasha,I bought the set for my daughter! She was excited to get them and played with them right away. She carries them everywhere and sings lots of the songs from the show.
1,Lot of money for just a piece of paper,"Do not buy. It's to expensive, there are many others papers high qualityfor much less"
1,Anyone who is not heavy into religion should skip it,"Yikes, this one could have been far better without the multi page rants on finding God. Give us a break if we wanted to be in church we wouldn't be reading a murder mystery!"
3,It's an okay read.,"If you like a good murder mystery...it's an okay read. Not too preachy, but remember...it's a Christian fiction. I found it an easy and quick read, with good character build up and a little intrigue. It was good for a free book."
3,Terri has done better,"I guess I am very spoiled. After reading her other projects, I have grown accustomed to in depth characters, solid plots, and great pacing. In this one, the characters were lovable, but somewhat shallow. The plot was decent, but definitely not her best creation. The pacing was rather slow. If you have never read one of her other books, then you should enjoy this one. However, if you have read the Newpoint 911 or SunCoast Chronicles series, don't expect that kind of excellence. This book didn't read as fast as her others.This was an average book. Pick it up at the library."
2,"ugh...the style, the preaching","terrible grammar. I mean so bad it distracts from what you are reading. the author has a biography saying she was a prolific romance writer, clearly they don't need people who can really write english properly. and pages and pages of preaching-bible quotes etc...the characters aren't even that likable so definitely does not make continuing to read the series worthwhile."
3,"Decent, if preachy, mystery","This is the first in a series of four books chronicling the lives of Christians and nonbelievers on a small island off the coast of Georgia called Cape Refuge. The mystery centers on who killed two beloved people in Cape Refuge, a married couple who owned and operated a Christian halfway house for reformed criminals and addicts. A few red herrings are tossed about here and there, but the mystery itself is solid. Morgan, the Christian daughter, assumes the everyday responsibilites of Hanover House while her agnostic sister, Blair, the town librarian, begins doing research in an effort to clear her brother-in-law's name. There's a budding romance between Blair and police chief Matthew Cade that's more fully explored in the other books, but Morgan and Jonathan provide a nice example of a happily married Christian couple."
2,"Good mystery, too much religion","This is a reasonably well written murder mystery. Some parts are unbelievable and not true to how life situations would really be handled. However, I got the feeling that the real purpose of the book is to convert people to the Christian religion. At first I thought maybe all the religious references were because the dead couple were ministers and you might expect that from their children. However, it is soon clear that most everyone in town, except maybe the killer, was reading the bible, spouting their views, etc. I have nothing against people having their own religious views, but this is not what I read a murder mystery for. Luckily I downloaded this when it was free, because I would really be upset if I had paid 9.99 for it. In the future I will read the reviews a little closer even if it's free."
2,More about religion than murder,"First let me say that for once the Kindle formatting wasn't horrible. A few glitches, but not bad.The story itself seemed to be more about why God would let some things happen than what actually DID happen. As a murder story it didn't entirely hold together, which saddened me because I think she had a good idea and some good characters, but they got over shadowed with the heavy handed God stuff. Not being a religious person it grated really bad for me and I found I skimmed a lot of things. I managed to make it thru this book, but went ahead and deleted the second off my Kindle. I don't think I can handle any more sermon."
5,Marvelous Reading-Cape Refuge,I enjoyed this book so much and will read the rest of Terri Blackstock's books just to see if they are all this good.
5,Oustanding,I read alot and it is hard to find a good book that actually makes you enjoy reading. This entire books series has kept me reading for days. This book as well as the others in this series is amazing. I found myself laughing with them and crying with them. although this is a suspence book I found that there was so much going on that anyone would enjoy reading this book. It is truely amazing and I would encouarge anyone to pick this book as well as the others in the series up and read them I believe you will not be disappointed.
1,to be avoided,not worth the price paid for this book. reads like a romance novel with extremely preachy overtone. cardboard characters. now i have to read the section about how to delete from my kindle. i am relieved that no trees died for this book in the king dle version
1,Disappointing read - I want to pick my preachers!,"I was hoping to find a new mystery writer and ended up with a preacher. It started with an interesting premise, but soon disintegrated into religious, born-again babel. The religious overtones would not normally have turned me off, but it was overdone and soon overshadowed the plot. I have deleted it from my kindle as well as book 2. I will avoid this author like the plague! Too bad too."
1,Cape Refuge,Good Heavens! The names of the characters are so trite. Cade? After about 20 pages I read the ending and doubt I missed anything.
3,So So,"First book of Ms Blackstock for me and I found it somewhat intriguing. It was suspenseful enough to hold my interest,but was pretty slow moving. The first 340 pages kept going over the same material and the story didn't start moving to a solution until the last 40 pages and then had a sloppy ending. Much of the mess in the end could have been avoided if the characters hadn't been so slow to respond. Too many gaps in the everyday activities of the main characters, that weren't where they should be when they should be and too much wandering off singly by the sisters that knew someone was out to get them."
2,cape refuge series1,very weak development of plot and characters in what could have been a much betterr story without the excessive religious overtones. couldn't finish it.
1,a mystery novel or sunday sermon?,"For anyone who is a mystery buff, this book is painful. The book begins with the murder of a beloved couple on Cape Refuge. Their distraught daughters are determined to learn the truth about their parents' lives and brutal deaths. Intriguing! But then author looses focus and starts putting her characters in jail so she won't have to weave them into the plot. One of the protagonists spends the whole book behind bars, and he never even consults an attorney. Unbelieveable! A good portion of the story is devoted to the characters' relationship to God, which may please some readers, but in reality, it acts like a filler so the author can keep the readers busy, and hope that they won't notice the glaring lack of a substantive story. I downloaded this authors second book, before I read this one, but will be sending it to kindle heaven unread."
3,Cape Refuge,"It was a ""good"" book but at times seemed to have too much going on. I wondered how Terri was going to get it all 'together' by the end, but she did. I will admit that I was rather relieved when I finished it. Kind of like running a race and being out of breath when I reached the end."
1,I can't believe this got these many good reviews,"This is a very poor ""mystery"" novel. If you want to read about how God saves - get this book - you will love it. If you love a good plot - forget it!!!!!"
4,Mysteries to make you think,"How can God be good if he allows something terrible to happen to good people? This is a question that was asked, but not fully answered in this mystery novel by Terri Blackstock. It is an unanswerable question, really.I did enjoy this novel. It was quick to read, and parts were extremely suspenseful. However, the police officer, Cade, although likable seemed to be a bit slow on the uptake. I came to the conclusion that it would be extremely easy for anyone to be framed for commiting any kind of a crime in his town because he didn't seem to look far below the surface.The book reminded me of a ""Jessica Fletcher"" kind of mystery with similar kinds of characters among the suspects and police officers. It had a Christian/spiritual aspect that was quite interesting, particularly when you saw how one character's prayers when things seemed hopeless seemed to turn the tide.I'd like to read the remaining books in this series."
1,What drivel!,"This book is terrible. I deleted it, and the second book of the series, after the first chapter."
5,Excellent book,I aways read this author. She has never disappointed me. I look forward to the next book in this series
2,Poor Quality,"I've gotten virtually no benefit from this. The tags aren't reliable. I recently walked around my house carefully pressing all of the remote buttons, even though nothing was lost, and it located none of the tags. The batteries in the remote were new. I've found that I need to reseat the batteries in a given tag whenever it stops working - annoyingly, randomly and frequently - which ironically I don't recognize I need to do until I, ummmm, locate the tag. They do get points for customer service - one of my tags arrived DOA which Sharper Image did politely and promptly replace free of charge."
2,Reciever disks have been battery burners,I have the older 4 reciever unit. The concept is great. It works well when the batteries in the recievers aren't dead. I've had mine two years and the batteries in the receivers with no use seem to go dead in two months. It's the same for all 4 receivers. They go dead at about the same time. Stock up on the CR2032 quarter sized batteries.
1,Batteries run so fast that it is useless,"Very often my wife and I spend large amounts of time looking for our house keys. So, one day I bought this product, and I was very pleased with it for a couple of weeks. However, the battery on the key chain runs out very quickly. At first we thought the original battery was bad, but we already used several of them and they all run dead after a couple of months (without actually being used to find the keys). Needless to say, if you're the kind of person who looses your keys, you won't be remembering to periodically replace the batteries until it is too late, pretty much rendering this device useless.Pros: works for a couple of times.Cons: never works when you actually need it, as batteries run out after a couple of months (even without use).Bottom line: don't rely on this product to find anything."
1,Surprisingly Poor,"1 star = Not usable.The ""beep"" from the tag is very low. I had to turn off everything in the immediate area, and make my children be quiet, just to try and hear the response.Found that if the tag ""is not in the line of sight"", then it doesn't respond. This is extremely discouraging because the lost item (remote control) was usually under couch cushions, pillows, in a toy box, etc. No response from the tag even though I was within 3 feet!The provided labels are so small, you only have room for a few letters. Not really usable either.All-in-all, this was an extreme waste of money. Very disappointed, which is surprising because of the trusted Sharper Image name."
1,as expected -- disappointing,"I""ve decided to buy this product against my better judgment... well, I ended up returning it. Even though it looks colorful and pretty, the sound is not loud enough to find anything with it. In short -- don't waist your money and time because you will end up returning it!!!"
1,Uhg...,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday in January and we have needed it a good 8-10 times in those 6 months to find her keys (which she always misplaces). I think it has worked once.When we first took it out of the box and tested it it seemed to work about 80% of the time. We could sometimes be right over it and no response. But after a short while (3-4 weeks?) we needed it for real and it was no help at all. The keys ended up being under some papers on her desk, which the remote was a good 3 feet from when searching the house.Basically, this thing is useless."
3,jon almada is a plant dont listen to review,reviewer jon almada has posted the same review on many sharper image products and the reviews are so good..... no brainer here.
5,Works Perfectly,"This product works perfectly, it can easily locate all of the tags from any where around the houseI recently scattered the tags in random locations everywhere around my house, and it was able to locate all of themThis is perfect for absent-minded people who lose things frequently"
1,It is as bad as the rest tell you,"I purchased the ""Now You Can Find It!"" locator 2 years ago. Today I am packing it up and taking to the electronics recyclers. I did not get even 3 months worth of use out of it; I quit using it within a month. Just slow at getting around to recycling. What a huge waste of money!When I first lost something, the device could not find it. I was only frustrated, several times, while walking around the house with the homing device that never beeped at all. Perhaps the problem was/is with the batteries--but they ought to have a battery warning built into the system."
2,I Know Now Why Sharper Image Discontinued This Item,"Again, I was so excited to find this product through AMAZon since Sharper Image didn't sell it anylonger. That should have sent a red flag up to me there but I was desperate and felt that anything Sharper Image would sell would be worth having. I ordered the product and though it works, it is only 70% of the time and one has to be directly within inches from the item a tag is attatched to. The beep is so very faint, if you have any hearing abilities...DON'T GET ITEM. It comes with a really cool magnet holder that sits on the fridge so that you know where the remote is at all times. You never have to worry about loosing that, however, anything else that you have lost...you might be a while finding it and yes, the batteries go quickly! A great concept but poor design."
1,Do not buy wowwee products!,"Our Roboquad was purchased at the end of November 2009 for Christmas for our 10 year old son. It has never worked. This company has the worst customer service that I have ever dealt with. They have NEVER returned a phone call, and have no email address to contact them at. You have to fill out an on-line form, which takes days to get a response from. When you finally do get a response, they don't tell you how to respond back to them. Since you can't speak with them, they don't diagnose the problem you may be having very well. We waited 3 weeks for a new remote, only to find that didn't solve the problem. It is now Friday January 29, and I sit here waiting for a response from them to an online form filled out last week. I feel like getting a working product from them is a full time job. I am ready to return this toy. DO NOT BUY!"
2,Not so smart,"I got this robot from my girlfriend for Christmas because she knows how much I love robots. I think this robot is a classic case of a great product that was poorly executed. It does NOT seem to react to it's environment. I've turned lights on and off around it, moved objects in front of it, made loud sounds near it, all with no reaction from it.This guy couldn't find it's way around a room on it's own even if the room was empty! As I write this review, I'm watching it struggle to get out of a corner... DUH! The thing that bugs me most is all the technology exists to make this a much better product for the money. If you get this as a gift, it will most likely amuse you for a day at best. If you REALLY want a nice robot, be sure to look for the i-sobot by Tomy... THAT'S A REAL ROBOT!"
5,This is a Tab Book!,"Although Aaron Lewis is an excellent singer and a great lyricist, he is not to be looked up to because of what he writes! He writes what he feels and has been through! He DOES NOT want to be a role model, or a motivational speaker! He wants to get that crap out to make himself feel better! That's how he copes with life! ...anyhoo...this is a tab book...get it because, you can learn to play all the songs on this album and sing the correct words if you play in a band...or alone for epiphany or outside!"
3,Weird,"This book ""Modern arf"" is so weird and boring me. I read it all. I guess I give three thump up!!!"
3,ONE-OF-ITS-KIND,"A stand-alone book: I can't think of anything comparing to this unprecedented approach to these two historically divergent expressions of human creativity, Fine Arts and Comics. As a matter of fact, this book proves that they are NOT ""historically divergent"", quite the opposite."
4,A Murder With Many Suspects,"It is June of 1940, and German troops are nearing Paris. In the White House, concern over the defeat of France is suddenly joined by shock. Senator Gibson excuses himself from a dinner in the State Dining Room and is later found murdered in the deserted East Room. Eleanor Roosevelt immediately goes all out to aid Police and Secret Service in tracking down the murderer. Unfortunately, the Senator's many adulterous affairs had infuriated not only his wife, but also a string of misled women. He also had political enemies willing to kill him. With her usual calm insight, Mrs. Roosevelt sorts out the mass of suspects until she reveals the murderer. Along with the mystery, you also get a picture of goings on in the White House during that momentous time in history. It's always fun to match wits with the First Lady in these mysteries while you watch history being made."
5,Monster Rocks!,"Monster cables are pricey, but they have a great return policy. We returned an SVHS cable where one of the the little pins broke. The company promptly sent us a new cable. No need for receipt. That's great service."
5,Please Read This Book,"I could not put down this book. Cunningham has a most magical way of making the veil between the story and characters of her tale and the huge archetype--in this case the 1st woman, Lilith--absolutely transparant. But she does this without turning her characters or their struggles into cartoons. Everything here is real, and larger than life simultaneously. Especially if you are a woman, and you wish to re-member your wild, pre-patriarcal roots, Elizabeth Cunningham will, I hope be as great a powerhouse experience for you, as she has been for me."
5,The Wild Mother,"I love this book! Iam very,very pleased to own this book, and very happy with the high quality of service given to my purchase. Thank you!"
3,not the most unlistenable cd ever...,"but certainly not the most listenable either. this cd's reputation as ""the most unlistenable"" comes from a review in trouser press record guide. dont get me wrong, theres no doubt that given the wrong sensiblities, the music on this cd can cause irritation, bad humour, & gnashing of the teeth. that said, compared to the mars' cuts on no new york, this is top 40 stuff. in another galaxy. it is relatively coherent, the vocals-a growled approximation of pig-italian- are at least entertaining, & the music is pleasant enough in a grating way. the delectable china burg does a delightful cameo on mirror mirror, her unique vocal stylings apparently consisting of singing without moving her mouth or tongue in anyway (try it & you too can be a no wave superstar!) anywho, john gavanti is the most casual dare i say UNpretensious music to come out of no wave & is definitely worth a listen."
3,free no wave,"this album is weird. it is good, but not for everyone I suppose. almost free jazz, but with a large amount of vocals, ala Phil Minton?, not really true songs, but all in all worthwhile if you like these types of musucs.the main drawback for me is that it is CDr, which to me means it has a very short functional shelf-life due to the inherent problems with CDrs. it was not clear to me that this was a CDr, but when I got it in the mail and realised it was a CDr, I looked back at the amazon product listing for it and after clicking around a few times on different aspects of the product page, there was indeed a disclaimer saying it was in fact a CDr. I guess my only beef then is that it was not clearly and upfront described as a CDr. I probably would not have bought it for $15 if I knew it was a CDr."
4,unlistening to the unlistenable,"I think I read somewhere that this is considered to be one of the most unlistenable albums ever. Maybe so. Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music' has gotten the same criticisms and I love it. So maybe the fact that I love 'John Gavanti' doesn't speak volumes for its potential appeal to popular audiences. Still, it rocks me silly. If you're into the No/Now Wave scene at all, you'll probably eat it up. The singing makes me giggle at the same time that it makes me feel just a little uneasy. And the music is out of control. Listen to some early Sonic Youth, the No New York bands, and a few Skin Graft records to set the mood. Stay up for three days straight and then put on 'John Gavanti'. Enjoy."
5,best work yet,"Zapato's 5th album is there best work yet. Rock and roll at its finest, they finally have the perfect balance between the music and there controversial lead vocalist. Best songs are : Entrada de bala, Recordandote, permanecer and el amante. Antonin Artaud is very teatrical and very dark. Zapato 3 scores a big time hit with Ecos Punzants del ayer, now if they could only get backing from the industry they would be touring stadiums in all of Latin America.Hari bol !"
5,Great TV!!!!,"While a little pricey consider what you get with this set. 4000 to 1 contrast ratio, 2 HDMI inputs and 450 brightness. This TV also includes a QAM tuner which will pickup non scrambled HD and Digital cable channels without a cable box of any kind. Worth the money. Did I mention the picture is amazing?"
5,samsung TV,Great TV! We really like the picture quality and the features are all really easy to use. Easy set up and exceptional quality.
3,don't sit below,I got the tv for my bedroom and its ok unless you are below it such as when I am in bed and then the tv darkens because of viewing range and lcd.
3,"Samsung LNT2342H 23"" LCD HDTV","I have now had this TV for about three weeks and am mostly satisfied with the set. Initially, when I attempted to utilize the plug and play feature, I was unable to obtain a signal (using the same coax from a CRT set). I contacted Samsung and Dish TV and neither could provide a solution. I decided to try a signal amplifier and that solved the problem. I am not particularly satisifed with the overall picture quality. SD is not very clear, but HD is acceptable, though not as clear as my 50 inch Panasonic plasma (I don't expect it to be). Also people take on a clay-face appearance and I haven't been able to solve this. I plan to purchase the Avia Guide to Home Theater calibration disc to tweak the calibration. Hopefully, this will solve the problem. This is an acceptable set for my kitchen and for the price paid."
4,"No one defines ""male"" so clearly as Harriet Wasserman.","Saul Bellow may be famous, may be genius, may be alot of other things, but in the end, he is just another stunningly selfish jerk who used a talented lady the way he used Kleenex. Never mind that without her he would just be another has-been hack writer. Wasserman's revenge is in letting the man reveal himself for who he truly is. You'll want to give her a standing ovation. You'll also have fun reading about how ordinary selfish jerks can win all sorts of prizes for writing and you'll end up hoping the Jackal who now represents Saul Bellow gets the kind of revenge HE deserves as well. Wasserman's writing style is a bonus.......spare, subtle, witty. Her silent sword hits the spot!"
3,More Story Stretchers for the Primary,"I was disappointed in this book. I also own the original story stretchers for the primary grades. I found this second book to be geared towards intermediate grades. The original book includes far more writing activities that, in my opinion, are more suitable for lower grades, such as K-2. These stories in the second book are too indepth and the writing activities, when included, have more higher order thinking scenarios-something my first graders are not quite ready for in their writings."
2,Poor quality for the price!,"I purchased this phone through T-Mobile in August. At first I was eager, since it listed all the features I was looking for in a phone. But as soon as I put my hands on it, I was disappointed at the level of performance. Picture quality was awful, I couldn't use the music player or connect the phone to my computer, and too slow. I took it to T-Mobile, they tweeked it a bit, but problems kept on coming back. My computer and laptop are both Mac, and for some odd reason it refused to connect. Some pros were: Battery life was good, Office applications were bonus, though since it was not connecting to my computer I didn't see the point of trying to use it if I can't transfer it. E-mail service was good, and you can add 3-4 email addresses and works well. Still after paying $375 for this phone I was less than impressed, so I returned it."
1,Totally Unusable,"At the time of writing this, I have had my t-mobile wing for three months. In the span of those three months, my t-mobile wing has become completely unusable.At this point, if I had to call 911, it would probably take me about 5 minutes of either waiting for the phone to actually go to the phone application, or 10 minutes if I got impatient after waiting two minutes and decided to turn the phone on and off in hopes that the phone will somehow decide to work.This is coming from a techno geek who thought it would be cool to have the latest and best phone. I even read the manual, and have never dropped it once.Did you ever wonder if one day technology would go too far and make a phone that was too complex, to the point of being unusable?This is that phone. Never again will I buy a smartphone, I'll just stick to the 19.99 ones, because after this all I care about is having a phone that works."
2,Far cry from the MDA,"I was happy with the MDA and thought this would have been an improvement on the old product. Not so. The OS is completly unstable and is constantly locks up when syncing or recieving a call. Hopefully a firmware update will be out soon to fix this. The buttons are overly sensitive and I am constantly hanging up on people or calling people inadvertantly. The grip tight coating makes it easier to hold onto, but is impossible to retreive out of your pocket if the phone is ringing. I do like the PAN capability which allows you share your EDGE internet with other BT enabled devices. It actually is quite handy. Other than that this is a dissapointment indeed."
1,Is this thing actually supposed to be new?,"Imagine that, T-Mobile will do a free phone for new service that they discontenued months prior. This thing has a slower processor than my 6 year old PDA! And Im talking SLOW! Spend a few bucks.... get ATT service, and get a phone that is worth a crap!"
2,Ordinary Phone,"There really isnt anything spectacular about this phone. It called people randomly all the time. The screen stopped working after a year only. At $300 I would think I'd get more out of it. I was carried away by the hype when I purchased this phone, but I will never buy this phone again. The internet processor is very slow so if you're getting lost, you'll get more lost before you can get the right directions. Anyway, I called about possibly getting it replaced but was told I had no insurance, which wasn't even offered to me at the time I purchased. I was told there was no insurance I could buy for this phone. Insurance won't help anyway because I was told I would have to pay about $150 to get a replacement phone! Such a waste of money! I'd rather buy a new Nokia!"
2,cool phone/ horrible service provider,"the phone is great for quick texting with friends, reading e-mails, passive web searches, and reviewing documents. you may find out, if you're wanting web speed, this is not the phone for you.Combined with T-Mobile's horrible customer service and the inability to troubleshoot after being on the phone for 2 hrs. In addition if your phone ever becomes defective do not expect to got into a T-Mobile store for a replacement like you can with other carriers. You May instead expect to not have a phone for 3 business days (no they will not ship on Saturdays), pay a $15 shipping fee in additiion to the $5-$7 you each month for insurance and of course to replace your phone you will need to pay $50-$150 (depending on the ""type"" of device) if They find that it is damaged vs. defective.but dont worry you can dispute the false ""damage"" charge with your cc company so that they have to prove the ""damage"" and voila! 30 days later you get your $50-$150 back."
1,"I hate this phone, it suckes.","I got this phone last summer, and i thought i made smart decision, but i was wrong.I really hate this phone... mostly because its really slow.And i hate the touch screen.... like when i am talking with someone,this phone calls some other people too bcz my cheek push the screen...and, it does not react soon, when i open the slide,it takes forever to show the appropriate window.anyways, there are so many reasons why i hate it.I would rather choose really basic cell phone than this.Good Luck"
1,"does not work at all, total piece of junk.","Blade is not straight and it cuts a spiral down the wire. cheap chinese crap. No adjustment for blade position, no spare blade. Save your money and buy something else."
1,Poor Design,"Tool is awkward to set up and use. Knurled depth adustment knob rotates too easily and changes depth of the cut as you are stripping the jacket. Results are either not deep enough to cut through outer jacket or too deep and inner wires are damaged. I used the Ideal auto cable slitter years ago, but was unable to find it, so I tried this tool. Had good luck with several Paladin tools in the distant past, but this tool is a bust. Since receiving and using this tool I have ordered an Ideal slitter and am extremely satisified."
2,Not that good,I had been using these for several years and finally had to give them up. As a previous reviewer stated the ear cups are pealing and leaving little black specs everywhere. Besides one can't wear these for more than an hour without them feeling uncomfortable. The cord has held up well for the several years though.
2,There's better out there...,I bought these a couple of years ago (from a big box store) for use on my workplace computer. The first thing to break was the left ear attachment. The metal adjustment band now slides completely out of the cup as the plastic housing is cracked (and taped). Next thing to go bad was the right ear cable. A few pulls from being caught under my chair wheels and now I have the cord taped in a vertical direction onto the back of the ear cup in order to connect the internal wires. I'm really not a very rough user but these things can't take much abuse. Oh and now the fake leather is peeling off the ear cups leaving little black flakes on my shirt. It's time to buy a new pair of headphones and sorry but it won't be made by Labtec.
4,Fast Food Craze Review,"This book was very enlightening and a bit horrifying as well. It should make everyone evaluate their eating style and become more aware of how we treat ourselves and well as the animals we share our world with. I would recommend it to everyone, especially anyone who cares about their health and diet issures."
3,Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller,"This book will be good for use in the classroom or by anyone seriously considering going the vegetarian route. The author has done a lot of research and includes many citations, articles, and pictures that she has found for her case: pro animals and healthy food; anti fast food and animal mistreatment.She begins by assailing the fast food industry for their unhealthy offerings and misleading advertising. She goes on to describe the mistreatment of factory farm animals in the name of the Almighty Dollar to line the pockets of these same fast food giants around the world. She also points out how the Humane Slaughter Act is either ignored or not enforced. According to Ms. Volpe, not only is fast food unhealthy, it costs pigs, cows and chickens a lot of pain, misery and torture to get to your tummy. She feels the only way to stop this horrendous treatment of animals is to not eat them. She concludes by promoting vegetarianism and its healthy benefits."
2,"Not what I wanted, but I guess I will take it.","It was a good film even though this was NOT a UMD, but a DVD instead. So, 2 stars is generous."
4,GOOD GUNDAM,"While I enjoyed this movie very much, I felt the second Gundam Seed movie was better. This movie is good and worth owning, and it does explain alot. There are scenes which need to be seen, as well as character development. But beware: Fllay is a mental case, not to mention a whiney seductress. I don't recommend this movie for kids under the age of 13, since there are some sexual situations."
3,The March on Washington for Civil Rights,"I know very little about the March on Washington except in reference to King's I have a Dream speech. Bass shows us the concept of the march first came up in 1941, and FDR persuaded black leaders not to do it through a Presidential Action. When black leaders decided on the need for a march on Washington in 1963, the organization of the march became more detailed and involved more organizations. Bass does an OK job showing a summary history of the march and the views of the participants. This is a short read and it does inform the reader of the actual event.There are better books out there on this subject. The one thing about Bass's book is the short summary nature of the book. One can understand the idea of the march and how it came about. Branch's three books probably explore this event more throughly than Bass."
5,Absolutely the best album of all time !!!,"I was only nine years old when my brother bought this album in 1970. The first three songs would catch my ear. Look to Your Soul was and still is my favorite song. I paid a hefty price for my own vinyl copy years ago, and took great care to preserve it. I was ecstatic to hear it was being re-released on CD. Nothing can take away from the beauty of the LP jacket, but the sound on the CD is better than ever. What's the Difference is really beautiful on this album. Words cannot really describe the beauty of this whole album. This album got me hooked on JR. I have collected many of his fine albums: Outside Help, Road, the list goes on. JR is the greatest!"
5,My Favorite Album ever!!! Realization,"I have been waiting almost 3 months for the album ""Realization"". It was one of the albums that got me through college, andf I lost it. We are talking 33 yrs. It means a lot to me and I cannot wait to get this album/CD. elaine"
5,A Timeless Classic . . . A Most Excellant Choice,"As a young teen in the late 1960's I listened to this album, then owned by my (slightly) older stepsister, Chris. It immediately struck a chord with me and I managed to snag a trade with her and I got to take this home. Over the years I have owned many copies. The album is still relevant today, and has been (almost) daily fare for many years now. A superb choice ~ a timeless beauty!!"
5,A Few Songs Missing,"This album demonstrated that a pop artist could have an awakening in his soul. I only owned one album by Johnny Rivers, and it was Realization. There are two song missing from the list that I distinctly remember - Rosecrans Boulevard and Tunesmith. It has been so long since I have seen the album, can anyone else verify this?"
1,Not compatible in Italy,I wasn't able to use this power adapter while on my trip to Italy. The prongs were too thick and wouldn't fit in the sockets.
3,Half and Half,"This box set is a box set simply to drive the price up. The Devil's Brother is a good restoration and an enjoyable flick- one of my favourite's of L&H.; But Bonnie Scotland is a bore to run through and a fine example of why L&H; should have stuck with short subjects.As for the extras, the short clips that included The Boys were enjoyable; the comentary was interesting in the Devil's Brother, but it seemed as if they had run out of things to say by the time they got to Bonnie Scotland. And while the documentary about short subjects was interesting, you really don't come away feeling satisfied- at all.All in all I would say a good box set- worth about half it's price. If you already have the Devil's Brother on VHS don't waste your money on the upgrade."
3,"Not their best work, but far from their worst","Unfortunately, unless you want to shell out for the excellent British Boxed Set, as well as an all-regions DVD player, this is the only decent L&H DVD still in print in the U.S. The 2 Halmark DVDs released about 5 years ago (and featuring their two best movies - Sons of the Desert and Way Out West) were much better, but they are out of print. Their best films were the shorts (generally 20 to 30 minutes long) released by Hal Roach Studios"": silent films from 1927-29 and talkies from 1929-35. Anything else pales in comparison. These two films are OK, but rely too heavily on music and/or serious plots - Laurel & Hardy are little more than comic relief. Their scenes are pretty funny, but the serious plots are horribly boring."
2,delivery cost : too expensive !,"when I bought this DVD, I saw very expensive expedition cost. I thought it was coming from far. But when I found the item in my letter box, I discovered it was coming from Germany, and I live in France !!! It's too expensive for such a short distance."
1,Disappointment,"Laurel and Hardy should never have gone into full lenght movies. Some of them were well done. These two, however, were very poor. Just a waste."
5,Long live Stan and Ollie!,"When Laurel and Hardy were making Fra Diavolo, I wonder if they had any idea that people would be writing reviews of the movie 78 years later. Of course they didn't. The fact that we still do shows just how amazing these two were, and how amazing their movies were (quick - name 10 other movies produced in 1933!). ""The Devil's Brother"" has some classic moments, as does Bonnie Scotland. Even though some may consider the latyer not their best work (I disagree) it will still put a smile on your face. Both were wonderful and a steal at 15 bucks!"
4,Laurel & Hardy better movies,"I really like the Laurel & Hardy feature length films. However, few are available in DVD format. About 15 years ago (before DVD were popular) the VHS format L & H films disappeared, some flap about copyright? The films available were very poor technically. I hope that era is over. These two films are well done in DVD. I am not a film critic."
3,Nothing much new here,"I do love Castlevania games and was eager to play Rondo of Blood for the first time, but I was a more than a little disappointed in this entry. Symphony of the Night was a mediocre Castevania game for the original PS, and it's gotten no better here. Rondo of Blood was enjoyable, but I feel that neither of these games utilizes the PSP to it's potential. If you just have to have a Castlevania game for your portable, you really have no other choice...but they really should have tried harder on this one."
1,WOW,This game was absolutely terrible on so many levels. Really boring. You run around in a one dimensional world swinging god knows what. TERRIBLE!!!!!
2,This game bites,"Yes, that was a vampire pun. Moving on...I bought this game for $[...] at a Gamestop sale awhile back and finally got around to playing it recently what makes it worse is that I brought this game with me on a trip as my only source of entertainment; GOOD GRIEF!The difficulty wasn't what really bothered me but the game IS extremely hard. I like a good challenge in my games but when the challenge comes from broken mechanics and utter BS it doesn't translate to an enjoyable game.I tend to prefer the Metroidvania type games more than these. Playing through stages in this type of game just doesn't tickle my fancy quite like the castle exploration aspect of SotN.I'd say the only actual reason for owning this game is to play SotN. I know this wasn't a great review but it's hard to explain exactly why it's so bad. It's just clunky, boring and difficult. It's frustrating; not fun."
4,Insanely difficult!!!!!!!!!,"The re-mastered version of Rondo of Blood is one of the hardest Castlevania games I have ever played. It is not so much the enemies or the obstacles you have to overcome, it's the restrictions of the main character-Richter Belmont. Once you get to the third stage you can rescue Maria and use her as a playable character. She is much easier to control than Richter. You can also unlock Symphony of Night (""S.o.N"") and the Original Rondo of Blood in subsequent stages. You can also use the old cheats for S.o.N which makes things interesting. The graphics are really incredible for the re-mastered Rondo of Blood, but it is really frustrating to get through the stages because of Richter's restrictions. If you are a fan of the series you won't be disappointed; just try not to break your PSP."
4,Trick Or Treat,"I've always enjoyed Castlevania games...well old school Castlevania games. Well...in general I'm a fan of old school games anyway. So I may be just a bit biased. However, in the end Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles is a strong addition of the PSP library and Castlevania lore. ""Rondo Of Blood"" is a challenging in both it's original and re-invented form. Those enjoying a strong platformer look no further. This is hardcore Castlevania.""Symphony of the Night"" (the best of all the Castlevania titles) is the perfect addition to this compilation. The one complaint is that it must be unlocked in order to play it. It's not difficult to do...and lord knows video game developers love unlockables!Pick up this treat for yourself if you're a fan of the series and want to try out ""Rondo of Blood"" in either of its forms. It's a great bargin and especially fun to play."
2,Sorry ... for just an audio cable is ridiculous to me!,"I'm tired of what-so-called ""Monster Cable"". 10 years ago Monster Cable phenomenon (that time for analog signal) was a hot discussion topic in many audio magazines.So far, everybody knows that the improvement in signal quality from Monster Cable is so little compared to its huge jump in price. This argument is much more convincing in case of digital signal. Believe me, with your human ears you can't detect the difference between Monster Cable and the generic. Also except you intentionally abuse the audio cables by twisting them or bending them sharply, the generic cables will do the job very well, even the cheapest ones. So do yourself a favor... except you're rich and don't mind spending money."
2,"Cable works, but pricy","Although some will argue the pros and cons of expensive audio cables, it is hard to imagine how one digital video cable can be better than another. The signal either arrives at the source or it doesn't.While I was happy with the cable, I can't see any advantage over a cheaper generic cable. Digital is digital."
3,Pope Factory - 'Hibernation Generation' (Buffalo Fire),"'Hibernation Generation' is the second disc I've ever seen by Toronto's Pope Factory. About as decent as their self-titled CD (see my review). Nothing to get too excited about here - but okay to listen to when you're in the mood to explore new music that you've never heard before. Tracks that make this low-priced title worth purchasing are ""Cul De Sac"", the seven-minute well-played ""High Wire Nerves"", maybe the rocking ""All You Destroy"" and ""Ceiling For A Sky"". Definitely has a classic rock 'vibe' to it."
5,BEST PRACTICE BEST THEORY,"This book provided more detail for target costings, more useful everyday, in both practical and theorical case. Moreover, this book use plain english for whoever in the world."
2,"Somewhat engaging, but ~200 pages too long","Not a book I would recommend. I found myself impatient with the detailed descriptions of rooms and spaces, which for me, added little to the story. Other than William's character, and the clandestine relationship he had with Darren, I felt like I was simply moving through life, day after day, with characters who I didn't find very interesting. The central plot was thought provoking, as an ethical dilemma, though not particularly original."
1,"Interesting premise, but boring book","A medical researcher finds a potential cure for an inevitably fatal disease that kills young people in the prime of their lives. Does he go through the proper experimental channels, thereby dooming several young people under his care, or does he ignore those channels, thereby possibly saving several lives? Hardly a new ethical problem, as I'm sure more than one researcher - AIDS researchers, for example - have faced this problem. In the book at hand, the author treats the problem novelistically, but his writer's skills are not up to the task. The characters are uninteresting, what one writer once called ""ideas with legs"". It's a long book, over 400 pages, and I gave up after 200. The idea merits the attention of a talented short-story writer and this writer is reputed to be just that. But as a novel, it's a failure."
4,Excellent Product-Unbeatable Price!,"The only only drawback of this product is that the string that tightens or loosens the frog is very stiff and dry, it already broke :(However all u have to do is use a thin black shoelace instead so it retains it usability and visual appeal.Definitely a 9 out of 10 for any sword enthusiast."
5,excellent quality and price,Great piece to add to a belt or baldric-very well made and a great price!
1,"RECEIVED A MONOPRICE CABLE, NOT BELKIN GOLD","Title says it all, the cable I received was a Monoprice cable that says Monoprice all over it, definitely not a Belkin Gold cable. Came without packaging, just in a plastic bag with a sticker with small black font that says ""Belkin Gold"" on it."
1,Blatant False Advertising,"This item was sold as a Belkin Gold cable. I actually received a cheap Monoprice cable. The package was labeled Belkin but the item is not stamped with the Belkin name and clearly says ""Monoprice"". I wish I had read the other one star reviews before purchase. This is a blatant case of false advertising."
1,This is not Belkin product,They sent me Mono price USB cable; this is absolute con. These cables are cheaply made by mono price. Please make sure not to buy this product from Margin Mart.
2,Not Necessary,"There are way to many of these available that are much better. This is repackaged and not necessary.Buy their live albums and whatever you can track down for studio cd's. Keepsakes is a decent mix, especially the DVD.Save you cash and spend it on something necessary (the debut or Scarlet)."
1,One of the most error ridden books ever,"If a book could recieve 0 stars, this would be that book. The book is full of errors. Some of the code doesn't even function that way its supposed to. Get the JavaScript Bible. It is a much better book for beginners to JavaScript, and very much accurate."
2,WEB BASED LEARNING CENTER CLOSED,I returned this book after finding the web-based learning center via the Waite Group is closed. The Waite Group no longer exits. You will be sent to SAMS for online learning.
1,Horrible,"As the saying goes: ""Nothing is completely useless - it can always serve as a bad example."" Or in this case, it can also be burned for warmth.If you're already a programmer, you might want to flip through this book just to convince yourself that you, too, can make a living writing computer books. If you're a beginner, I do not suggest you look at this book at all - it takes some experience to appreciate a book as bad as this."
2,Don't waste your money!,"By the time I write this, the book is quite outdated (covers JavaScript 1.0, version 1.5 is the current); that is NOT the reason for my low rating. I decided to still write this, just in case there is a new version of this and people want to see the history of this author / publisher. Here are my thoughts:Positive:- decent (not excellent) beginer book...Negatives:- lousy reference book- approximately half the book is useless, meaning off topic: one chapter is spent on Java, another is spent on Navigator Gold (I would have not appreciated this even when Navigator Gold was actually a useful tool)...- partial coverage of certain important subjects (operator precedence, bitwise operators)- way too much fluf (he spends one chapter on the history, keep in mind this is the days of JavaScript 1.0!!!)Look through this at the library, and then have a look at a real JS book..."
2,barely brought in 2 channels,"I live in a mobile (not in a park) surrounded by huge evergreen trees, pretty far from the tv stations in Seattle. No matter where I put the antenna (even on the roof) it doesn't get good reception on any of those channels. We do, however, get 3 ""basic"" channels that are somewhat viewable that we didn't have before. Needless to say, I'm not impressed at all. The reason I picked it was because people said it got good reception if you were blocked in by trees or buildings. Keep in mind, tho, that it may work great in another location, just not in mine."
5,Great antenna,I use this for all of the new digital channels coming in my area. We get 24 channels now and hope to see more as the digital switch deadline approaches. I have it stuck in my attic.
1,Most expensive and worst performing,"I also tried Terk HDTVa, Terk FDTV2a, RCA ANT1500, and this one is the most expensive yet the worst performing of the bunch. If you live 40miles out from the stations and they are all located in the same direction, get the Terk HDTVa. Otherwise consider RCA ANT1500 or the amplified ANT1550/1650."
2,not for digital converter box,"I installed according to directions. I have 21 local stations and 9 are digital already. When I connected this directly to the TV, it kind of worked. I got a couple of channels. When I connected it to the DTV box, I received even fewer stations than with the little internal antenna. A big total of 3, as opposed to 5 with the little internal antenna that came with the TV. I do live in a wooded area but I still think I should have been able to pick up more stations with this than without it. (And yes, I went online to properly orient the antenna.) I am glad it worked for others but it was a disaster for me and went back the same day."
2,Big disappointment,"Before buying this antenna, we had satellite on the downstairs TV because it would only receive one channel; the upstairs TV receives 5 channels over the air with its rabbit ears. Since all of the channels we're interested in lie in nearly a straight line, it seems to stand to reason that this antenna, located in the attic above the upstairs TV, would bring in at least those 5 stations, and probably several more. But when we discontinued satellite service, installed this antenna and adjusted its position to the optimal, we found that it only brings in 3."
1,: <,"add said indoor/outdoor ... nearly worthless to me as all i could get was nbc, and not so well,,, gave it to a friend, it works well enough for him"
2,power injector problems,"Like some others, my antenna did not work when the power injector was plugged in. It functioned as a mediocre antenna with the power injector unplugged or not used, but signal went to zero with it on..."
2,phillips manta antenna,the phillips antennt does a good job but is very directional the furthest transmitter is 12 miles from my house and they are spread from 6 degrees to 307 degrees and I can only receive from the stations at the 300deg. area. there some on uhf and vhf and they all com in about the same. I would like to return this antenna for one that does a better job.
3,Average,Not overly impressed with the strings. I thought I would give them a try after reading other reviews. I will keep looking for a better product.
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the product. The first time I tuned my guitar after replacing the string, it broke! In case you're wondering, I didn't tune it too tight. It was playing on a like a 3G or a 4D on a 1E. Would like to have my money back..."
4,Argicultural Handbook,"Includes information useful in estimating the nutrient values of food and presents 5 tables of data on composition of foods -- edible portions of 100 grams, edible portions of 1 pound as purchased, selected fatty acids, cholesterol and magnesium content. Data is given on energy, proximate compostion, vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavian, niacin, ascorbic acid, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, and potassium."
2,Read the Publishers Weekly review,"yeah, the publishers have it pretty much in a nutshell, the book takes a potentially interesting subject and turns it into an analysis of species dispersion across continents, don't buy this book, just pick it up in a shop, read the first chapter and the bit about the calculation of longditude and you will have got all you can out of this book, (except if you are interested in the precise proofs, in which case turn to the proof section at the back.)"
4,Historical dec tive work with maps,"Among other books on the early Chinese treasure fleets of exploration, this book has the most facinating narrative. The author anchors his finding in the historical setting of China of the Ming dynasty. His use of maps that have survived in Europe and his claims that the information on them must have come from Chinese sources are a bold claims. The author's conclusions, if accurate, give an entirely new view of global ""discoveries"" and raise the question of how different global history might have been had China not subsequently isolated itself. Menzies' conclusions need critical review by other historians."
4,Kept in the dark,"Easy, fascinating read. Well researched and presented in a balanced way that allows you to follow the authors' thinking and discoveries. The book exposes the fallacies of conventional western teaching of history and Europe `discovering' the world."
1,1421,"I just started this book, within the first twenty pages there's mention of the corn supply to Nanjing being cutoff in 1356..... What a joke, I'm sad, I had looked forward to reading it and now I see I've wasted my money, unless corn means something other than Maize."
5,Absolutely Stunning ...,"Revolutionary theories that may change history.Beutifully written with intriguing hard evidences,such as sunken Junks, that will soon be verifiedor discreditted. A must read."
3,If you're really interested,"If you're really interested in these issues, I highly recommend that (before or in addition to reading this book) you read the review by Robert Finlay in the Journal of World History v.15 no.2 pp.229ff (June 2004) (Go to the nearest state college or univeristy library). In his detailed review, Finlay does what scholars are supposed to do and cites sources for all his points! Decide for yourself."
1,needs help...,"This book is a flipped pyramid.The whole construction stands (?)on very unsure-unverified (maybe) facts (well, no, there isn't any).Each hypothesis get used in the next chapter as an evidence to prove (?) other hypothesis which again are presented as evidences for the next one...I'ts a circular mythomaniac way of thinking.Very-very dispointing, because when questions are indeed valuable....author's answers are so poorly built-up that it destroys the validity of the question itself.Avoid it as History book.Read it as a novel."
1,"Little research, lots of conjecture","This is a terrible book that is supposed to be based on credible research but which is mainly filled with guessing and conjecture. The book revolves around a map that could describe, with proper stretching, changing of markings and such, the New World, reminding me of the ""science"" that is the translation of Nostradamus' prophecies. Menzies links any unexplained artifacts around the world that may date to the early 1400s to this particular expedition, and repeatedly discounts without argument other logical explanations that would likely have created these artifacts.The likelihood of this story being true is further degraded by fact that the Chinese, a civilization known for keeping detailed records of its history, have never, before or after the publication of this book, attempted to claim any role in the discovery of the Americas.Placed in the fiction section I would give it two stars. Promoted as a serious piece of research and historical fact, it deserves zero."
2,"Great fiction, assuredly not history","While it is true that the Ming treasure fleets sailed extensively, and could conceivably have reached Australia or the Americas, Menzies certainly doesn't prove it. Others here have picked apart the inconsistencies and just plain falsehoods in ""1421"" better than I could.But as fiction, it's a pretty darn entertaining read (4 stars, maybe).To other reviewers: 1) No, not everyone criticizing the book's scholarship is ""racist."" I, for one, would be quite intrigued if it were true, and did initially find it plausible, before I went fact-checking. Notice also the several reviews by Chinese readers who found the book poorly researched. 2) Quit being so China- and Eurocentric, respectively. No culture is perfect. 3) The prevalence of ""Well, circumstantial evidence and outright lies are okay, because he writes convincingly and has an interesting idea"" makes me weep for the quality of education in our society."
5,A must read,"What a gripping book with a story that needs to be told. I couldn't put it down, and have since found bits and pieces of information in articles in National Geographic and Smithsonian that verify many of his findings. This is a book that needs to be read by all historians, and major research done to get our history books in line with the facts."
2,"Read Ivan Van Sertima's work ""They Came Before Columbus"" and ""Early Americas Revisited""","Dr. Ivan Van Sertima is not an amateur Historian like Mr. Gavin Menzies claims to be. Dr. Ivan Van Sertima is a noted Linguist and anthropologist and as lectured at more than 100 universities around the world. One should study his work called ""Early Americas Revisited"" and ""They came before Columbus""."
1,About DNA problems with modern native americans + chinese,"The studies of native american indians from all over North and South America, done by such scientists as Spencer Wells, does NOT show these peoples to have DNA in common with the modern Chinese that would thus be showing a common ancestor of the two peoples that lived just around 580 to 600 years ago (or 29 to 30 generations ago). The DNA sequeances the two groups share show common ancestors more like 12,000 years ago (or 600 generations ago). Therefore, theories in this book of any 15th century Chinese settling in the americas and becoming the direct ancestors of some modern day native North Americans or native South Americans is obviously all wrong."
1,About what this book says about Henry V,"Menzies claims that in 1421 English King Henry V could not outfit his soldiers with guns. In the book ""Gunpowder"" by Jack Kelly it is stated that in 1415 Henry V bombed an aea of France with cannons! Clearly if Henry's army had cannons they surely had muskets. Menzies is just plain wrong in his over-glorification of early 15th century China compared to early 15th century Europe."
3,modals,"This book is full of modals; ""must have"", ""could've"", etc. These are built one on top of the other. This makes the foundation very flimsy. But the reading is entertaining nevertheless."
1,Bogus History,"Pseudo-history has never been my thing, and I'm upset that I bought this book before understanding its true nature. Having become increasingly uneasy with the flimsy ""evidence"" presented to back up his theory while reading, I was devastated to find out Mr Menzies is essentially a liar (please see other reviews for more details). Sad to know I contributed to this by purchasing a copy... even more sad to see that the barriers for what counts as 'history' to the pub have been lowered substantially."
5,Everything in it makes perfect sense,"The idea that Chinese maps were used in the European discoveries of America makes perfect sense. Along with that comes a question: would Columbus have told Queen Isabella that the Chinese really discovered America? I do not think so. It is prefectly logical that these voyages were kept secret by not only the Chinese (due to radical shifts in China) but by explorers who wanted to take all the credit. Academics are quick to criticize Menzies, mainly since he departs from their own developed theories. Dismissing this book out of hand is reckless and short sighted. One other key factor is Menzies' intimate knowledge of the seas (winds, currents, etc.), which most land-locked academics lack. This book (and others about the period) can give us important insights into the Chinese character (temporarily aborted by Mao, the great destroyer)which can help us decifer how China will work in the world - get ready!"
1,"poor science fiction, not worth a second glance...","Mr. Menzies, for all his work, has compiled something (one hesitates to call it a book) that would not pass muster in most middle-school history classes.Even the most ardent Sinoplhiles would hesitate to call this work ""history"". It is less historical than Oliver Stone's JFK and more on a level with something out of Kim Jong Il's PR network.Shame on you Gavin!!"
1,"not just dubious, but boring","Much has been written about this author's thesis that the Chinese charted much of the world in the early 15th century. In my view, the evidence is circumstantial and highly suspect, and the book is very lightly footnoted. More importantly, though, this book reads as if it was written by, well, a submarine captain. Interesting ideas are occasionally brought up, only to be forgotten in the next paragraph. Many arguments are disjointed, leaving the reader to scratch his head when trying to understand how the author arrived at certain conclusions. In one chapter, the author digresses into a story about an African safari that ended when an enraged hippo threw a boat over the author's head! Gavin Menzies may indeed have discovered some compelling evidence for China's exploration of the world in 1421-1423, but he should have hired a real writer to help him make that evidence convincing."
2,Interesting Fantasy,"Mr. Menzies is really reaching here. His findings are based on myths, legends, and folklore; not solid historical facts."
1,"Entertainment, but certainly not History","The only valid reviews possible for this book must be done by academics who spend their professional lives delving into the primary sources cited in a history book.This book is fantasy history. It takes a true historical set of events, well-documented in and of themselves, and then extends it into fantasy using 'sources' that have been found, if you do your investigation like a number of academics have, to be either complete misinterpretations or unsubstantiating evidence.Mr. Menzies is not a serious historian. He is either deluded or paid to spread delusions. That so many others have followed in spreading this dishonest and intellectually offensive as history is both an insult to historians and probably also a sorry reminder that the general public will eat anything as long as it is sweet and exotic."
1,Fiction from middle to end,"Menzies' ""history"" is to real history what alchemy is to science: fiction, but told in a compelling way to make gold from rubbish, and with enough truth at the beginning to lend credence to the rest (there's a good deal of real history at the start, but unreliably told). It's embarassing that so many people have been taken in. And shaming that Menzies - and his publisher - have made vast sums out of the public's gullibility.Do read Robert Finlay's review, ""How Not to (Re)Write World History: Gavin Menzies and the Chinese Discovery of America"", (Journal of World History, June 2004: it's available online) for a long and in-depth evaluation of this book and the author's methodology. There's also been a lot of discussion of the matter under the title of ""Popular History and Bunkum"" on the H-ASIA list on the academic H-Net site."
2,interesting science fiction; poor history; poorly written,"The topic addressed is this book is extremelly interesting. It is inspiring, intriguing, and fascinating. However, speculation is presented as a fact everywhere. Potential possibilities are presented as proven facts. The conclusions are thus misleading. The text is poorly written."
1,Complete bunkum,I'm amazed that intelligent people I know were impressed with this. Menzies' ignorance (certainly) and dishonesty or self-delusion are almost beyond belief. I wish I could give a negative rating. It's so sad that this book has an overall good rating.
1,Unbelievable,"This is by far the worst book I have ever tried to read. The author starts from a good argument and then gets lost in interpreting any fact as an evidence in favor of his point of view, even when there would be thousands of more plausible explanations. I apologize for not being specific, but I think I have already lost too much of my time and patience trying to read this thing. However, if you are the kind of reader who likes UFOs and conspiracy stories, go ahead, maybe you will enjoy this book."
1,Great work of alternative history fiction,"Were this marketed as alternative history, I'd give this four stars. But instead, it's asserted to be accurate. To write a complete debunking of every claim in the book would be longer than the book itself, and I'm simply more interested in other projects.Instead, I will merely use one example of a fundamental error: the Chinese character for 10,000.Menzies takes that to mean exactly that - 10,000. Unfortunately for his analysis, the Chinese used that character to also mean ""a lot"". Proof of this can be found in money from the era which included a gold figurine no larger than a redskin potato labeled ""10,000 ounces"".If he cannot bother to get a basic translation correct (as opposed to relying on transliteration) without bothering to question why China would have ships and fleets way out of proportion to what one would expect, what does it say about the rest of his analysis?"
2,Interesting but unconvincing,"Having read Charles Hapgood's ""Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings,"" I was fully prepared to accept Menzies' thesis that the Chinese discovered America in 1421. However, his evidence is circumstantial and it is strung together by speculation and conjecture. Not only is his thesis unsupported, his reasoning is faulty, his thinking muddled, and his prose dull. There are also numerous factual errors in the book. The Chinese may have discovered America, but Menzies doesn't prove it."
2,"More facts, less speculation.","To call this book ""unrestrained speculation"" as some academic reviewers have is far too polite.Avoid."
3,"Good Concept, Poor Research","The book is well written and a good read. While I did enjoy reading this book the entire there were many thins stated in the book that just destroy any credibility. At the very begining of the book the author states that he came up with this concept, then went looking for evidence to support it. Much of his evidence does not support his claims, and each very small piece of evidence he finds, he draws amssive conclusions from. For example, there is writing on a stone on the Cape Verde islands that he believes is an Indian language, from this he draws that the chinese must have been there....?? This is basically the path of the entire book.Like I said overall a decent read, but a bit of a reach."
1,This is History? Give me space aliens!,Menzies' spins his tale by a series of speculations built on conjectures resting on possibilities and underlain by wild guesses - and he then pronounces the result a certainty. Eric von Danekin showed more scholarship in making his claim that aliens built the pyramids. Immanuel Velikovski's Worlds in Collision was a masterpiece. Pseudo-science and pseudo-history are going downhill.
4,lost history,Gavin has spent years chaseing leads that suggest america was populated by chinese peoples.With Mertz and Vinning as backup not to mention Hendon Harris Gaven has pin pointed the physical landmarks through his journeys.As a best seller it is a long and fast read.
1,Trash history,This book is a shameless mishmash of speculation and misdirection that only obscures the extraordinary voyages of the Chinese 15th century mariners. There are some good books out there about the Zheng He voyages - read them instead of this tripe.
1,buy it used...if you must,"This book appears to be lectures the author has given slapped together to make a book. so many of his points are repeated over and over that it became so annoying I couldn't even finish it. The author jumps to bizarre conclusions, gives incorrect information and even though he stresses his research over the years a lot of information is easily found on the internet. His attempts at humor are not funny, they are just strange. I also kept thinking after reading so many times that more information will be posted on his internet site, what was the big hurry to get this book out? Also, why didn't he contact all these experts on the Chinese ship captain he researched until after his book was written? This book is just silly."
2,interesting at times but logic is weak,"Overall I did not like this book. The premise is interesting, and there may be some truth in some of the points made in the book, but I was dissappointed with the weak reasoning, and the exaggerated tone of the book. By half-way through I felt I was reading a book about ""Bigfoot"" or the ""Yeti"", rather than a well researched history. I will avoid this author in the future."
4,regain power,"China had great power for 4000 years.This book prove this history. China are now regaing power, which would lead to stability in East Asia, because East Asian itself is Chinese world. Historically, Korea and Japan as well as Taiwan was China(We are kind of brother!) 21 century will become the Chinese century."
5,People that give it 1 star...,"are probably in bitter resentment about ancient China having had the ability to sail around the world.. dont let your WHITE PRIDE get in the way. The book was awsome, and I dont doubt that the Chinese Nation will rise again. Europe is going down."
1,An Amusing Read but ...,"hasn't this theory been totally discredited by historians? The books own ""facts"" don't even hold together and are contradictory. According to an account on NPR, at least one of the maps has been revealed to be a fraud created expressly for the book and another is believed to have been created more that 100 years after the author suggests not but Chinese but by Jesuits and later doctored to add Chinese characters and eliminate the original Western language and references."
1,A Fine Work of Fiction,"Yet another one of those books that had all the markings of something I would rather use as an assault missile from my deck when the neighboring children get too loud as I'm trying to read.I wish I could give this a great review. Had Sir Menzies filed his work in the fiction section where it belongs, I may have. But unfortunately, a history this is not. I don't need to give you specifics as they are too plentiful everywhere else.All I can say is that I really enjoyed the book for many reasons. Among them I now know that literary talent is judged not only by its product but also by its categorization."
3,INTRIGUING ** INTERESTING ** TRUE?,"1421 by Gavin Menzies is a fun historic read. Brings up lots of questions and ideas for reseachers. Although over one hundred pages of footnotes portend to back up the research much of Menzies' findings go unsupported. I liked reading the book but one must be careful about accepting everything you read. You need to research well before accepting all, but good story. Interesting ideas."
4,Thought Provoking,"If you love literature that challenges the prevailing academic view of an issue, then you'll like this book. It is well researched and the author's experience as a naval submarine commander has obviously given him insight that ordinary historians could not possibly have. For this reason I think that the overall impression of the book, that the Chinese and not the Europeans were first to chart the Americas, is accurate and well documented. Of course the author takes some artistic license with the timeline and narrative, but the evidence is solid and surely to be backed up with genetic data acquired by the Human Genome Project, as the Chinese left colonies here and there in the Americas and this explains the Asian allele frequencies researchers are finding in the Americas. Overall a good read and recommended."
5,Earth shaking,Fabulous book. Will rattle a lot of history professor cages! Exciting read. The book was even mentioned to us by a university prof. in China in May.
1,Laughable,"Anyone who is seriously considering spending money on this book should read Robert Finlay's review in the June 2004 issue of _Journal of World History_. You will learn far more factual information from Finlay's review than from Menzies's book, and you'll save yourself some $$$ in the process."
1,Academic Review Article,"Before you buy this book, or even after you have read it, you should read this academic review article by Robert Finlay in the ""Journal of World History"". An earlier amazon reviewer supplied the citation for this article, but it is also available on the internet at:http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jwh/15.2/finlay.htmlIt is a rather lenghty rebuttle of Menzies ideas and more importantly his methodology. It may seem like a lot of reading to do before buying a book, but as Menzies tome is quite long itself you owe it to yourself to read this first."
1,Hype and Gloss,"While the book contains many interesting bits of information, the manner in which those bits are woven into a skein supporting Menzie's hypotheses borders on the scurrilous. This work suffers from a severe lack of scholarly integrity, as well as Menzie's overwrought and often fantastic conclusions based on the thinnest of so-called ""evidence."" The author's exuberance for his own radical hypotheses clearly clouds his judgment and conclusions. This is a shame because there is probably some truth to at least some of Menzie's claims."
5,Discovery of America by Chinese explorers,"This part of history has been neglected, and it is about time It is about time for this for it to be set straight. As explained in the book, The records were mostly destroyed when China turned inward. The Chinese themselves have not claimed credit for the voyages of Zheng He. Further research could no doubt be done, especially in finding evidence of Chinese landings at a variety of places. Nevertheless, this is an important book and well written. A minor defect is the confusion resulting from the recording of Chinese names sometimes in official pinyin and sometimes in Wade-Giles romanization."
4,A Chinese Tour,"This is one of the best written and researched books I have read. It captures the Chinese explorations c1421 in vivid detail. However, I belive time will tell that there were others who traveled these routes before the Chinese and were the ones who gave the Chinese the maps to make the journey. This is borne out by the fact that the routes that the Chinese took were obviously touring routes rather than exploritory routes.Minzies himself writes that the Chinese met civilized Europians in places far from Europe."
1,out there,"i got this book because gleen beck recommended it, but the book is out there. Has some neat facts, but the conclusion of some of it is far out there."
5,Incredible book. Incredible work from Gavin Menzies,"This book is pretty long and so full of all kinds of facts and very well thought out ideas. It took me a couple of weeks to finish it.But this is a book that everyone should read. It is so clear, so convincing. There is really no arguing with it.Someone should make a new movie about 1492, and a whole series about 1421-1423. It makes more sense now that Columbus thought that he had reached China, or Chinese territory. There were Chinese artifacts there, and he had heard reports of Chinese ships coming across the Atlantic from the area of the Grand Banks.Can't go into it all here. Just an amazing book of amazing work. Goes to show that dedicated amateur historians can outclass professional historians if they have the discipline and energy.Just amazing."
3,"Fascinating Subject, so-so writing","The subject is fascinating: China and its commercial fleet and their voyages of exploration, and even more: China's high level of civization that the West took centuries to equal. The author, however, has to puff himself up and repeat how he discovered the information to support his view. The fact that he was a naval Captain and had visited the areas traveled by the Chinese and had technical knowledge about sea travel that other historians didn't, allowed him to put together facts thought to be unrelated. But we GET it. He did a great job, but better writing and editing would reduce the book and make it a more readable, and enjoyable experience."
2,"Interesting, but would take it as entertainment, not necessarily fact","There are quite a number of conclusory leaps of faith in the book. While it makes for some interesting stories and presents another point of view on history, I would take it all as entertainment and not as a new text book."
3,1421 The Year China Discovered America,"1421 is an entertaining book. While reading it, I had a hard time not believing it. The author is very skilled at providing just enough information to make you believe but not enough to convince. It is best read as entertainment.The orignal premise of the voyage of discovery was that the emperor wanted to increase the lands offering tribute.If that is true then the rest of the story follows. Yet Marco Polo arrived in China in the 1270 timeframe so if the emperor wanted to increase his status, he would have sent an army back with Marco when he returned to Italy.Anthropologists and Archeologists need to rely on written evidence to justify and convince. There may have been earlier contact than what is commonly accepted. After all if the present coastal migration theory from Africa holds, then there was always a link for all the peoples. The author tried to make this link more immediate. As for me, I am skeptical."
4,The Mahogany Ship,"An enjoyable read but, as other readers have noted, it would have benefited from more liberal use of the blue pencil to tighten the prose, remove cliches and personal figures of speech.One incident that is supposed to support the thesis is the story of the Mahogany Ship, the wreck of which is said to have been sighted in sand dunes at Warrnambool, about 200km SE from where I live. Difficulty is, despite all the speculation all we have is a couple of ancient anecdotes. A lot of time, money, and scientific expertise has been spent probing the dunes and grazing land near Warrnambool, over decades, with absolutely nothing to show for it. The search continues. These is an equal amount of speculation that the so-called Mahogany Ship was a Portugese caravel lost in about 1522, or a Spanish vessel. Another explanation is that the principal witness was simply a liar. Mr Menzies does not acknowledge these easily accessible alternative explanations."
1,This concept was debunked on a PBS special.,"His ""maps"" are hilarious. He has one that shows the Chinese fleet practically covering every inch of the world's oceans. Artic, Antarctic makes no difference to these intrepid sailors.The author grew up in China so those connections could explain some of the motivation. I also enjoyed him having the Chinese making sperm donations throughout the New World into New Mexico and Arizona. They were definitely intrepid and must have also had Viagra. This thing is a joke, but probably made and old caucasian man, the author, rich."
1,Agreed the book is overly rough on 15th century Europe,"I had previously seen museum gun collections showing dates of 1300's for many European guns. Therefore, I knew outright that the fellow writing this book was obviously all wrong about Europe being gun-free in the first few decades of the 1400's. And during the 1420's there was a truly-fine Muslim civilaztion in Spain as well as Byzantium's accomplishments (which also included amazing architecture and a strong, literate government with many different bureaus more than a match for China's government at the same time). Europe was often an actually outstanding and advanced place to live in the ealy 1400's contrary to all the author tries to make us believe otherwise. Why this man wrongly wants us to believe China was such a better place shows how either badly informed or sneaky or deranged he is (or all three)."
1,Misinformative about Europe in the early 15th century,"Menzies makes several foolish claims, like that Europe was so technologically far behind China in 1421. For your info Menzies, the Byzantines of Europe had Greek Fire, a weapon that could enable flames to travel on water. It was this instrument that kept Muslims from invading Europe for centuries and it was far superior to anything the Chinese ever invented. Menzies also claims that the European armies of 1421 had no guns. Couldn't be further from the truth on this one. By 1390 Europeans from one end of Europe to the other were getting outfitted not only with guns but canons too. And Europe was already flatout in the Renaissance in 1421, they weren't on the eve of it as Menzies ridiculously claims."
1,Is Menzies ill-informed or just a rotten liar?,Where on earth does this guy get this messed up info on Henry V of England?It is totally disprovable Menzies's really dumb assertion that Henry V did not have guns in his army in 1421. Was Menzies thnking of Henry the first or second when he wrote this dreck?
4,Get this one,"This CD is the first commercial release from SoCal-based SPF1000. All the tracks are decent, with Witch Hunt as truly outstanding. If nothing else prompts you to get this album, there is an amazing remix of Haunted House which incorporates samples from Disney's Haunted Mansion ride. If you grew up loving the Haunted Mansion (as I did), the bonus (download) remix alone is worth the price of admission."
1,Manufacturing defect,"Although the CD shows no sign of damage, five of the twelve songs could not be played in any of the CD players I have. Caveat emptor."
1,basically a software manual,"it works through lot of examples using its (free) program ARC. The program is good and offers functionalities not available in S+ or SAS. But much of the content is on HOW to OPERATE this program. Click this button. Pull down that menu... Since my class is using S+, these information becomes irrelevant and distracting. Mixed within the usage instructions are actually formulas. Very disorganized for a first-timer like me."
5,Steve's philosophy should be shared by all!,"This book outlines in very simple steps how your organization can attain ""Brand Harmony."" It appears to be a simple concept, but his book will walk you through this detailed process. This book also shows the importance of everyone in the organization to the branding process. It's way more than just marketing materials - you have to start internally!"
5,The definite Branding process handbook,"If Seth Godin is the most intuitive marketer today and Jesper Kunde the most analytical, Steve Yastrow is indeed the 'best option' for everyone involved with developing a Brand -and that is in fact Marketing-.He understands Brands as a rich reality, the whole aggregate of the customer's interactions with a company's activity. Beyond advertising and even physical product, everything counts when it comes to build a great brand.But the true merits of the book rely on it's pedagogic value:- He shows a whole working dynamic which includes analysis, planning, execution and even a way of being so exciting that few books resist the comparison.- You will understand where he wants to reach because his explaining method is easy to follow. It's the simplicity of the one who masters a subject.Great buy!"
1,Rather get a root canal than read this book again!,"I'm thinking about burning this one. If it wasn't for the burning sensation in my eyes from reading the same dull, ""Be the Brand, Raw, Raw, look at me being the brand!"" I would toss this one into the lake but fear it would pollute our water supply. Can you imagine all the brainless Executives running around spewing tag lines from this book? The, ""I get it, I want it, I can't get it anywhere else"" line made me vomit. You don't get it Steve. You just don't get it, but you CAN get a serious case of hemroids from reading this book."
1,Terrible book,This book is a relic of the past and is not worth the paper it was printed on. The author tries to make a connection between the rock 'n' roll of the 1960s to the trash of the 1980s. As a former music critic who read this book years ago I can honestly say that this book did little to enrich my knowledge of music.
5,The Bible of Heavy Metal,"If you're like me and have spent hours reading ""Heavy Metal: A Cultural Sociology"", or if you are at all interested in the Metal community and the roots, styles, and spirit of Heavy Metal, then this book is a must have. This edition is less a revision, and more a republishing of ""HM: A Cultural Sociology"" with an additional chapter acting as a rather large update on what happened in the decade since ""HM: ACS"" came out. Dealing with the development, enemies, fans, artists, outlets, community, subgenres, positives and even negatives of Heavy Metal, this should be read by every Metalhead and rock fan. Highly recommended, especially in the cheaper paperback format."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Possibly a relevant guide for a space alien wishing to do cultural research on the planet earth but for anyone who lives here and has the slightest awareness of heavy metal the academic phrasing of the text won't conceal how redundantly obvious most of the statements are. When the book isn't stating the obvious in it's dry elaborate way it's making some unsupported ignorant seeming claim. I'm sure there's plenty I could stand to learn about the genre, in the form of both insider commentary and intellectually rigorous outside observation, but neither is present in this book."
1,nation wide rip ridaz,"This cd has lots of jams in it,although it has lots of tight lyrics but no beat or bass.It's one of those cd's that you think is dumb and you want to return it. A do not bye"
4,the picture doesn't do it justice,"Doesn't the picture of this watch look, well... dull? Not to mention the description, ""Charcoal Gray Watch"". Fortunately, I first saw this watch at the Skagen counter at Macy's, selling for twice the price. In reality, the face has a shimmering iridescent effect, catching the light and swirling it around. the watch is is seamlessly ntegrated into the bracelet, and the fit and finish is handsome and well made. The watch is slim and elegant, just what you'd expect from Skagen. The deduction of 1 star? When I brought the watch in to be sized, the savvy jeweler looked it over and pointed to the bezel and said ""that's going to pinch"", and she was right! It can slide down your wrist and dig in a bit, but it's a minor annoyance, and overall this watch is a great buy. I've gotten unsolicited complements every time I wear it."
3,All style. No substance,Beautiful watch but it came without instructions to adjust the wrist band. I contacted Skagen but they could not email any instructions for wrist band adjustment. One jeweler could not figure out how to adjust the band but recommended another jeweler. I have not got there yet. So my Skagen watch looks beautiful in its case.
3,"Decent Watch, Less Than Stellar Fit","I would have been lost trying to adjust the links on this watch without advice from previous Amazon reviews. Even with that, popping out pins with a paperclip and small hammer was quite tedious. What worked better for me was to use a cheap 0.5 mm mechanical pencil (the kind with the metal tip sticking out). Simply push the tip into the hole with a decent amount of pressure and the pins will come out the other end, no problem. Sadly, the watch didn't fit as well as I had hoped - one link too many and it would slip past my wrist, and one link less offered no mobility or comfort."
4,Good looking watch,"Bought this at Costco for my husband. He's not a watch person either but likes this one so much he even wears it to bed. The link is actually very easy to adjust. I removed the links myself with instruction from the Internet (I google it). You just need a tool small enough to fit the tiny holes on the links to push/hammer the pins out. About the ""water resistant"" feature, you should read Skagen's definition ([...]) of the various degrees of resistant (3ATM, 5ATM, etc.). Water resistant to 3ATM is ""Water resistant to 30 meters (100 feet). Will withstand splashes of water or rain but should not be worn while swimming or diving"" so this watch should not be submerged in water. My only complain is that the dial color, even very beautiful, makes it a little hard to tell time but not a big problem. Other than that, we are both happy with the watch. Elegant, classy and timeless. So far it's working perfectly. Very good price for the quality and look. Would recommend this to a friend."
4,Weighted frog keeps it right side up but legs don't mimic natural movement,This frog only vaguely looks like a frog but it has a good double-hook and a weight that keeps it right-size up.
1,product change now un-usable,"This is my 3rd order from this company but this time the product has changed, at first it appeared like the same product just a different shade of color, but when attempting to use these mailers, they are next to impossible to separate the two pieces and open the envelope. It IS possible but so much time is spent dealing with this issue, I must return and find an alternate supplier. When contacting the seller they admitted the problem but had nothing to exchange with so I had to return and order from another seller. I would recommend the seller but ask about the mailers before ordering."
5,Do not let the snobby Amazon.com review fool you,"Integrating guitar with a subtle flourish of other accompaniment, the LAGQ have crafted an unique and very listenable album. The compositions are often surprising, alternately delicate and boisterous, and always masterfully played."
3,Not for everyone,"Although this album demonstrates the versatility of the Guitar there are pieces that just do not work for me. This feeling is similar to the feeling I get from Elliot Fisk's album on Paganini Caprices...brilliant technique but the translations are forced and not appropriate for the guitar. There are pieces on this album I enjoy and others that irritate. Unfortunately for me, I did not review this album before I purchased it. But hey, one man's garbage..."
3,Doesn't Match 95 Grand Am,"I have no idea what color would match, but the difference is stark. Once applied, it looks like a frog green vs. a forest green.Otherwise it seems like it would be an awesome product, the roller-ball pen part makes it really easy to apply to small scratches, but it's still the wrong color.It does look like it might match my 2001 Ford Windstar, which is odd, cause this is supposed to be a GM color."
5,Great product,Nice quality product from Canon. It allows me to use the higher qualtiy lens cover by Canon that I also purchased as opposed to the flimsy one that came with my S5IS.
5,It worked,"The lens adaptor worked as desired. With it and a 55 mm uv lens, I was able to protect the internal lens extending mechanism form becoming inoperative due to dust etc binding that mechanism."
2,Leaves shadows when adaptor is installed...,"I tried taking pictures from about a 3 foot distance, and am getting shadows in the pictures when using the cameras flash. I have to zoom just a bit to solve this. I have the lens adaptor, a diffuser and a uv filter installed. I tried to remove the uv with no change. I also changed the adaptor by Canon to the aluminium one which is a tad shorter and used only the diffuser and got the same results. I love the camera, but I always have a filter attached. Any suggestions???"
3,Does What it's Supposed to...,"You need to remove a ring from the front of the lens to install this. Don't lose the ring. You won't always want this on the camera. The adapter does not hook to the lens. It hooks to the camera and the lense moves inside it. As a result it's longer than the lens and a bit bulky. A standard case will not fit over it. This unit is best when you intend to keep the camera in a camera/gadget bag. It holds lens adapters and filters nicely. If you intend to leave the adapter on the camera, get a 58mm lens cap. The standard one won't fit. By the way, you may want to forgo the wide angle adapter. The camera software does a great job of photo stitching. you can get the equivilent of wide angle without the distortion."
3,OK for the price - clunky attachment,"If you want to use a filter with this camera, you have to use a lens adapter, and this one works adequately. The mechanics of taking off the lens ring so you can attach the adapter are not intuitive, but it gets easier on subsequent attachments. Unfortunately, it also gets easier to cross-thread the adapter in place unless you are very careful, and then you have the challenge of applying enough force to get it off but not so much that you break it.Someone somewhere may find a use for the lens hood which is a mandatory part of this set, but I haven't identified one yet."
3,A necessary evil,"This kit does the job. Unfortunately, the Canon soft case recommended for the S2 IS will not work with this adapter on the camera. Canon should have included a lens cap for the adapter rather than a lens hood, which I will probably never use. Without such a cap, the UV filter on my camera is very exposed to damage."
2,Poor design,"The adapter is ok although the price does not justify its cheap plastics and black non-matching color. These are minor issues that don't bother me much. What is a major design flaw is the lens hood. If you operate the camera in the wide angle mode, the hood causes visible vigneting in the corners. Moreover it absolutely may not be used together with flash, where 20% of a picture will be dark due to hood's shadowing effect.I can't understand such a poor design from Canon, especially, in comparison with S2 that is simply a wonderful camera."
3,tube adaptor,Unit should be silver colored to match camera body. Could not use the tele adaptor as it would bind as the lense was extended
5,Utility Item,These lens adaptors are good stuff. It allows you to shield the lens from unnatural lighting that may distort photos and the also use filters and other lenses
4,Expensive But Essential.,Pricey but essential. Good protection in case you bang your lens. A must have in order to use the wide angle screw on lens. Makes a great lens hood for eliminating flare. I would have given it a 5 if it wasn't so expensive for what it is.
1,IT STINKS!,"THIS IS A TERRIBLE PRODUCT IS MADE OF CHEAP PLASTIC AND AFTER YOU ATTACH IT TO CAMERA THERE IS A LOT OF PLAY IT DOES NOT FIT NICE AND TIGHT,IT MAKES THE CAMERA FEEL CHEAP, THE PEOPLE WHO DESIGNED THIS JUNK DO NOT HAVE ANY IDEA OF MEASUREMENTS, IT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE IF A DIFFERENT COMPANY MADE THIS THING.... BUT CANON MADE THIS...I DON'T GET IT WHY IT DOES NOT FIT PERFECTLY SNUGH.BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARDS GUYS!!"
3,Seems a little flimsy but!,It does it's job. I got this when I purchased myCanon PowerShot Pro Series S3 IS 6MP with 12x Image Stabilized ZoomTo protect the camera lens. I think the price should be lower because of the feel.The feel doesn't match the camera feel. The Powershot S3 feels much more solid.
3,okay for plastic,It fits on the lens but it;s just hard plastic - would be much better if it were aluminum and rubber.
3,If only I could..,I was pleased with the way these mated to the camera and each other. I was NOT pleased that the zoom lens was not threaded meaning you couldn't even use the hood (which I wouldn't lug around for the S3 alone). The plastic feels VERY flimsy and worries me if it can handle the weight of the lens.If only.
5,A must have option.,If you are moving up to having an excellent camera such as the S5 IS then you should have what is needed to protect your lens. A bit of advice for those unfamiliar with the camera and do not know how to install the adapter. You first must remove lens cap and portion of camera that the cap attaches to. To do this there is a button on the camera next to where it is marked 8.0 Mega Pixels to the left of the lens while looking at it. This will allow you to remove the part you need in order to connect the lens adapter. Another positive is that with a new 58mm lens cap you do not have to worry about the cap popping off because the zoom does not need to make contact with it. Happy Photo Shooting!
2,Only for lens protection,"If you need to protect the lens: OK. If you need this adapter to use with a converter, take a look if worthwhile to buy the converter.Two stars for the lens protect."
3,OK,"This adaptor fits perfectly and easily. My only problems were with the fine thread designed for the lens. It's understandably fine but, being as it's made out of plastic it makes it difficult to remove the lens' at times. Also would of liked it to be painted a charcoal color to match the camera."
2,I was warned,"I was warned that this Canon adapter/hood was not up to par. I read the reviews but bought it anyway. Cheap, flimsy and not even the same color as my Canon S5. Very difficult to get filters to screw in because the barrel is so flimsy. Do not buy even if it is the least expensive."
1,Damaged Product,Received damaged product. Took the trouble to return the item and received new one in a few days.
1,I don't see the used for item it also takes too much space too,I don't know the used for and also takes a lot of space I don't understand why I bouth it personally don't recommended is not clear how it helps you taking pictures.
2,Pricey plastic,I purchased this product for my new PowerShot S5IS camera. I was disapointed to find that this product is made of plastic. For the price I paid I expected better build quality than plastic. I plan on buying a much less costly replacement lens adaptor that is made of metal that I noticed on this site. I use my camera daily in my appraisal business and need all the components to be durable and dependable. I am disapointed that Canon would make this product with plastic and charge so much for it.
4,Good accessory,"I bought the adapter and lens hood as I have always used a lens hood formy cameras, I wanted to be able to use filters and I wanted to protectthe lens on the camera.These it items serve the purpose, but have one failing: there are noprovisions on the lens hood to allow the use of a lens cap on it. Notliking to leave a filter or lens exposed during storage, I have toremove the lens hood in order to put a lens cap on the filter. The lenshood ought to have threads on the front inside, or just a ridge aroundit, to accept a lens hood so one doesn't have to remove the hood to puta cap on."
1,S3 IS Accessories,Very disappointed by Canon on the fit of this adapter.Adapater and shade attachments block camer lens view andcreate flash shadows
4,Why black when the S2 is silver ???,"This is a good accessory and the other review does a great job of highlighting its benefits. My only complaint is the color. The design folks at Canon probably overlooked the fact that the S2 is silver, and the black adapter/hood looks odd on the camera, to say the least - hence the 4 stars."
4,Canon Lens hood and converter,"I bought this a few years back for my s3 Canon camera did what I wanted it too do works well sense then I have given the camera to my wife justs loves along with the LAH-DC20,LHDC40 set."
1,Made of plastic,"While this product is highly useful in attaching other lenses and filters to your camera, it is made of plastic and the threads will go bad in a short time. Do yourself a favor and google ""Lensmate"". They sell an adapter for Canons that are made of aluminum for the same price, and do the same thing."
2,Get a Lensmate,"After going to store after store and even ebay and not been able to find the Canon adapter for under $36, I took into consideration at the Lensmate adapter for the S2/S3 IS. I just could not see myself paying so much money for a piece of cheap plastic. I became aware of the Lensmate adapter here on Amazon from reading people's opinions and I'm glad I did some research!The Lensmate adapter is made from metal and it fits perfectly. I bought the 52mm adapter because it's cheaper to buy lenses and filters. I tried the Canon adapter, but it just didn't feel sturdy or like it could take a hit."
5,Canon LAH-DC20,Perfect fit. Looks & works great. Absolutely no vignetting at the wide focal length. The only downside: You have to remember to take it off when using the flash.
3,A good product.. but,"I found this a bit pricey for what is effectively 2 pieces of molded plastic. Is it useful? Only if you want to add lenses or filters on top. Without that, it is pointless increasing the size of your camera with this addon. I bought it wanting to protect my lens with an UV filter in front but found that the size trade-off was not worth it."
3,you can definately find better with a little effort.,"I ordered this because i had to have the lens adapter fast so i could take pics with a filter for a wedding i had to attend. I realize that yes, it is a tough plastic material...however when your changing filters/lens frequently..it will bind if your apply too much pressure. $30 for a piece of plastic somehow just strikes me as wrong.I found an aluminum adapter with a rubber 3 stage hood for about $15 elsewhere. I will keep the plastic adapter since i did buy it with a gift certificate, and just keep it permenantlly attached to the teleadapter lens, and use the aluminum adapter for filtered shots.If your changing lenses / filters frequently i would recommend finding a metal adapter, i think if your in a rush you would end up crossthreading something."
3,"As described, but...",I bought this for my Canon S3 IS so that I can use a protective UV-1 filter and the lens hood. The only problem is that with a filter in place at full wide angle the lens hood can be seen in the corners of the shot. The adapter works fine and fits perfectly and even looks nice. I can use various 58mm filters including my Tiffen circular polarizer which was my biggest reason for purchasing this adapter but if I shoot at full wide angle I cannot use the lens hood in combination with any filters or it ends up in the corners of the shot. A bit of a bugger for me considering I shoot a lot of landscapes.
5,Humanity's Adolescence,"Grounded in city planning and actually reinventing ""the city"", thisoptomistic tome is a passionate look at Soleri's 'Arcology'as wellas the wide domain of possibilities for how we can live as human comminity, in harmony with all the rest of the world. A gem from the recent past - 1960s. Will we mature gracefully from this wild adolesent ride we are on or die?"
2,Mr Paduano needs to learn how to take Infrared pictures,"Yes, I know I sound cruel, but I just received his book, and of the 104 pages, there are 57 pages of some pretty sad looking infrared photos.No, I have not begun to read the book, but how could I follow his instructions when I can see that I simply don't like his infrared photos.AND, the reason I purchased his book was all the GREAT reviews it received.Listen, maybe I'm wrong about his photos. I'm no photographer, so what do I know?....And, yes, I'm real sorry I bought his book..."
2,Glorified Magazine,"Let's make this clear... I won't put any more effort into writing this review than the author spent on the book itself. So this is going to be short and sweet! This book is a glorified magazine. Worth $14.95 - tops. The pitfalls of bookbuying online, I guess. You never know what you are going to get. Anyways, most the book comprises photographs that actually discourage me from bothering with infrared. The text portion, however brief, is nothing more than a bland introduction to infrared. The uninitiated might even be led to believe that Kodak and Konica are the only game in town in infrared films. Throughout the book the author treats these two as the ""Coke and Pepsi"" of infrared films. I'm going to look elsewhere for a good source of info on this subject and suggest you do the same!"
1,A Waste of Money,"I have 3 digital infrared converted cameras. I'm always looking for hints on shooting and especially on how better to process images in Photoshop. This is the 4th edition, and dates back to 1998 (shame on me for not checking closer). There are exactly 2 pages on Infrared Digital cameras (none I have ever heard of). If you want to shoot infrared film, this book is still very dated. The last 2/3 of the book consist of infrared images from the author's portfolio. I was enticed by the glowing reviews, but found the book totally useless for my needs."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"I know this cable is only $9.95,but it is only worth .99cents.This cable will do absolutely ""Nothing"" for your internet speed or connection. Yes,it will work OK,but the price is totally absurd.Just use the least expensive phone line cable you can find in your local retail store,which I am using right now and your internet connection will work just as good."
4,Gets the job done,"Used this for toning and for patching a few times. Great banjo. Service ends are well made, belt clip is solid."
1,Becareful about above review by Elias Montealegre,This person has given all excellent reviews for three watched by this seller. He did not review anything else. I think he belongs to that company.Just a warning.
1,muy mala presentacion,"la presentacion de reloj no es la misma que la foto, no tiene segundero y la terminación es pesima"
5,excellent presentation and price,This is a vey elegant white/black different watch.Excellent price and presentation!!!!
5,The Best Yet!,"It's amazing that this stylish, light and powerful wireless accessory has not found more enthusiastic owners and users yet. I have gone thru Bluetooth headsets like candy (Jabra, Motorola, Plantronics...etc) and until I had the pleasure of being introduced to this fantastic and powerful gadget, had basically given up on finding something that REALLY worked.But now, not only has Nokia come up with the most superior sound quality both input and output, but they have also done this in very small form factor and with an elegant and hip 'jewel' like twist that will be envied by all others. I HIGHLY recommend this easy to use, comfortable and accessible headset for all those warriors who need something that works and is beautiful too."
2,Why do you have a USB drive in your ear?,"I won this headset in a raffle, it is my first Bluetooth headset, and I have a Treo 650.My experience:1) Everyone that sees it in my ear says or thinks: ""Why do you have a USB drive in your ear?"" ...just doesn't look right.2) If my phone is not close (3 feet), it gets static. (my phone can talk bluetooth to my laptop from about 15-20 feet away ...so my phone is probably not the issue)3) People tell me that they can't hear me well when I use it, perhaps because they hear all the background noise.I'm about to purchase a different Bluetooth headset ..wouldn't recommend this one."
3,Great for youth and adults who love horses,"This anthology contains good to very-well-written stories about horses and the people who love them. Most of this material appeared on the pages of EQUUS Magazine. The quality of writing in these tales improves after the first few until the horse and rider adventures become real page turners. Some are humorous or touching, others are imaginative or inspiring and some are tragic. The owners are men and women, teens and little children but they all respect and love their mounts. Some of these horses make millions of dollars for their owners while others teach their riders life's lessons. This is an excellent book for any horse owner. Suitable for children mature enough to understand horsemanship. I'm buying copies as presents for the children in my family."
3,"A nice collection, but!","I would bet money that all these bands are really the same band, the music sounds much too similar. Either that or they all used the exact same equipment. I like about half the songs on here, but they just get old since they all have that eery similarity."
5,love her music almost like being right with her when she sings,what a lovely talent women she was.her music was so heart felt.u can almost feel her prewsents when she sings.love her music
5,Great,"This is a great book, illustrating and describing amazing work by an outstanding installation artist. A must read for anyone interested in installation art."
1,Tripbuilder - London: Travel Guides That Simply Get to the P,"This is just a pamphlet. It doesn't have any photos and the print is very small. I don't believe it is a good value for your money, especially with the addition of shipping and handling. The Eyewittness Guide to London is much more informative and entertaining."
4,Excellent book,"If you have just started crocheting, this is the book for you, excellent projects and pictures. The explanations are excellent too. I just love this book and will be making lots of the projects too, have started window vallance already."
5,Superb!,The book was delivered as promised. The quality was exactly as stated. Truth and integrity on the seller's part made this transaction superb!!
5,Elegant designs that you simply must have in your home.,"The designs in this book are mostly outstanding - I will be busy for a very long time! Rarely have I seen so many tasteful and useable designs in one book. I am a seasoned knitter and lacemaker, but only considered taking up the crochet hook in order to have some of these beautiful projects adorning my beds and windows. Only criticism is that some of the charts could be larger."
5,Perfect,Beautiful pictures and story. i also purchased a Miss Spider hand-puppet along with the book so the story comes alive when I read it to my Grandson.
4,capitaes de abril,Will I be able to watch this on my dvd player here in California? What kind of format is this PAL or NTSC?thanks for the help.
1,WOW! How many albuns they have????,"I'm amazed by the quantity of albuns from zeze e luciano....It's almost one for year and the INCREDIBLE thing is that ALL the albuns SUCKS A LOT!!!! All the front cover photos are the 2 with a real lame aparence, and the songs are so mediocre that i just can't believe why someone likes this!!! Do yourself a huge favour and stay far away from this!!!!"
5,"Fantastic, A +, gold star","Wow.In the last year I have transformed into an opera Maniac with the help of the cd. It's got all the greats - Pavarotti, Fleming, more Pavarotti - as well as the other greats - Puccini, Mozart, Verdi - compiled to produce the single most inclusive 2-pack set of operatic music I have ever bought. This is extensive, not expensive, and wonderful. I thoroughly recommend it.Becky, from CT"
4,Furious and melodic anarcho-punk.,"The Ex have been playing their uncompromising brand of anarchist punk rock for over a decade now. In the past they have collaborated with kindred spirits like the Mekons, Dog Faced Hermans and Chumbawamba. The Ex have also recorded with Dutch avant garde jazz musicans and jazz cellist, Tom Cora. The one thing that has remained constant (aside from quality music and uncompromised creativity) is that Ex discs have been hard to find in the US. Starters Alternators will change that sorry situation. The band's debut release on Touch & Go should be relatively easy to find. The band's hyper-rhythmic sound is remains intact with Steve Albini's production complementing the songs. Most songs feature driving percussion, scrabbling guitars and off the wall vocals. Most of the songs are sung in English, but the closing track is an adaptation of a Dutch folk song. This is a wonderful record for adventurous listeners. Let the Ex jump start your weary ears."
4,some big producers of 80s synth-dance make this a must,"This jam packed compilation has the two tracks GIORGIO MORODER wrote for Sabrina, ""Like a Yo Yo"" and ""Pirate of Love."" Plus it has a good number of her productions by STOCK AITKEN WATERMAN and PWL. Plus, there are a handful of extended remixes. I just wish more of the Stock Aitken Waterman 12"" versions had been included--there's an extra 20 minutes of space left on the disc, so they could have included them, and even ""hot girls,"" which is missing entirely from this compilation."
2,Back in '88...,"The only thing that has ever haunted me about Sabrina(Salerno) can be seen on the cover of this compilation: her breasts. Sure, she had a cute, vibrant voice with that funny italian accent and her smash hit 'Boys' was a bright,sexy,goodhumoured thing (preferably combined with the sultry video - she was only 19 at the time and had an appearance that made your tongue hang out).'All of me' was the second release from that period (also with a beach video), I think it did pretty well on the charts.The other songs I'm afraid are rather forgettable, impersonal pop-workmanship, not even the professionalism from writers like Moroder can save the ship - or the bra - from sinking."
3,COLECCIONABLE,"Simplemente una album de coleccion, marco una epoca en los 90's y aun es dificil de conseguir."
2,One great song. One good one. But the rest?,"Mention the word ""Sabrina"" to the average listener in the United States, and most likely you'll get a blank stare followed by a ""who?"" But in Europe, she's an Italian performer whose sex appeal and body curves helped her achieve a string of modest dance pop hits in the late 1980s. ""Boys"" compiles those singles with a few remixes. The obvious higlights are the title track and ""All of Me,"" which is three-and-a-half minutes of dance pop bliss by writers/producers Stock Aitken Waterman. Elsewhere, though, the CD falls apart--and fast. The production on many of the remaining tracks is embarrassingly dated, which wouldn't matter if Sabrina could actually sing (she can't). Stock Aitken Waterman fans will want to pick up ""Boys"" for ""All of Me,"" but there's not much else to recommend to casual listeners."
4,AWESOME!!!,I really like this cd. I think it's amazing for such a young singer to write such awesome lyrics at only 16!!! My whole family likes this cd.
5,The music is great!,"I really like Krystal's style and her stand! And I don't know what one reviewer was talking about when he/she was saying Krystal dressed/posed immodestly. The worst pic is when she's in a T-shirt and jeans and is leaning away from a boat rail. There's nothing immodest about it! Anyway, definitely buy the CD she's awesome!"
4,A Christian alternative,"The first thing I thought when I heard this CD was, ""Oh wow. A Christian Avril Lavigne."" In my opinion, that's an honorable comparison. Like Avril Lavigne, Krystal Meyers has an excellent voice that is showcased on an album of great song-writing and production. Her songs, however, have a lyrical content that strikes an immediate chord with Christian audiences everywhere. The songs are great, but not cheesy. The lyrics are faithful, but accessible. This is, overall, a great record. I only hope that, to avoid being stuck in one light, Krystal takes her style an originality further than Avril Lavigne has."
5,WOW! A CD I actually like every song on,"I sampled this CD today and I am going to buy it soon. It is amazing! When I first saw this CD, I just got that feeling that it was going to be very good. And I was right.1. The Way to Begin 5/5 Krystal is so talented to be only 16! I love her lyrics, and the beat is so cool too.2. My Savior 5/5 I love this song! It is totally awesome!3. Fire 5/5 Another great song! Great voice and great lyrics!4. Fall to Pieces 5/5 Great song! Ohmigosh, she is going to be topping the Christian charts.5. Reflections of You 5/5 Great song! I love the lyrics.6. Lovely Traces 5/5 I love this song! Great beat and great lyrics!7. Anticonformity 5/5 Great song!8. Rescue Me 5/5 I love this song. I love the beat!9. Sing For Me 5/5 Great lyrics. I love it!10. Can't Stay 5/5 I love this song too!I can't pick a favorite song! They are all so good! I can't wait for her 2nd album to come out. Hopefully it will be as good. Krystal Meyers totally rocks!!!!!"
3,In response to the criticism of conformity,"I guess I'm not really your average Krystal Meyers reviewer. I've heard her songs, and I think they are decent, catchy tunes, though by no means are they exemplary. However, I would like to respond to a reviewer who gave one star not based on the music but based on what they thought of her image. Now, I am a firm believer in the fact that a believer needs to have a clear and moral image, but who are we to judge whether or not she is sincere about her ""non-conformist"" attitude? Furthermore, perhaps Krystal is merely referring to a little verse in a pretty well know book that goes like this: ""Do not conform any longer to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is-his good, pleasing and perfect will."" Romans 12:2. In other words, perhaps we should all dig a bit deeper into the Word and be a little less inclined to judge those we don't know at all."
4,"Solid Lyrics, Very Good Sound","Krystal Meyers combines a very good voice, solid rock music, and uplifting lyrics into a fine CD.Although she is quite young, she demonstrates a song writing ability with a great deal of depth. The tracks here range from those that rock quite a bit to the more mellow. All of them are positive with a Christian theme.Some particularly good tunes on this album include the following: The Way To Begin, Fire, and Rescue.This is one that is definitely worth a listen, or many."
5,"Clear, useful explanations, keyed to Zerwick's grammar.","This very slim book has extremely clear, simple explanations. Better yet, it is keyed to a verse-by-verse grammatical analysis which tells you exactly which article to turn to in the grammar when you are looking at a difficult construction in the Bible. Highly recommended. Originally written in Latin by Maximillian Zerwick, it has been translated into English by Joseph Smith, S.J. For more reviews on grammars, lexicons, textbooks, and other Greek resources, see ""http://www.mindspring.com/~jwrobie/littleGreek.html""."
4,Great variety but some flavors too salty,"Most of the stick jerkys are good (some of them are quite long), but I found some smaller bagged kinds (not the premium) a bit too salty and not much flavor. It may just be me because my friend said it tasted fine. Maybe I just got an extra salty batch.The jerky is moist and chewy with some unique flavors (honey stung and pickled sausage come to mind). For a complete listing of flavors, you can go to Choo Choo R Snacks Inc's website. This pack contains 50 pieces of 32 different flavors.If you want to get a taste of the different varieties that Buffalo Bills has to offer, this is a great option. It even came with a free sample of their Supreme Coconut Bar!"
2,"not bad this,slightly better than usual Made-For-TV fare","this is an ok film,i suppose.not a classic,but merits a watching.it involves a middle class family,the wife of which dies,leaving the father to provide and raise his children alone.it charts the problems he faces rather simplistically though,and doesnt really get into the deeper problems and psychology involved.also,the characters themselves are too one dimensional and stereotypical.why would the guy refuse help from the doctor?yeah ok he might be proud,but he would know in his heart of heart it was for the best.also,the ending is very poor.halfway between standard hollywood happily ever after,and the rather depressing,it finishes abruptly and questions are left unanswered.all that said,at least some thought was given to this film.sans for the few gaping plot holes,this is an acceptable film.2 out of 5"
5,The mother of all true spy stories,"The story of a Polish Jew who ran a network of Soviet radio spies in occupied Europe, was arrested by the Gestapo in Paris, gained their trust, and ultimately escaped. The greatest true-life spy story I have ever read -- would have been made into a movie long ago if Trepper had been working for the U.S."
3,Liked - Not Loved This Book,"Elizabeth Lowell is a one of my favorite authors and when I saw some titles that I had not read I had to purchase. However, although her style of writing and her ability to instantly make you feel like you are THERE in the story did not distract from my problems with the plot. I like the hero and the heroine to fight other obstacles not the the heroine's inability to figure out who she really loves, and then when she does figure it out (FINALLY) - the hero does not believe her! Also, I did not care for the heroine to actually have sex several times with the wrong guy when everyone who is reading the story KNOWS that he is the wrong guy. However, that's just my plot preferences, someone else may not have any problems with it. There were also some major jumps in the story line that did not seem cohesive with the rest of the story."
3,Fair effort by Lowell,"Very sexy story about the chinese and American brothers. Sort of a saga. Interesting story and characters, but meanders on without any suspense. Dialogue a bit lengthy."
1,Elizabeth Lowell / A.E. Maxwell / Anne Maxwell,"I purchased this book, as it is one of the earliest publications of the author most commonly known as Elizabeth Lowell.It was quite dated, and I was unable to even get into it.I do not recommend anyone but an extreme Lowell/Maxwell fan purchase this book."
3,Commercial Mixes necessary,The recipees are excellent but require you to use commercial mixes that are sold by a company that is listed in the back of the book. I think they published this book.
3,Bright Light,"These are super bright bulbs. We use them in hanging lights over the island in our kitchen. The only problem I have it there appears to be a ""halo"" or ""light streaks"" around the lights. I know it is only these bulbs because we have them in two of the three hanging lights. The third lightbulb looks identical but does not throw off those shards of light. Overall I like them in the kitchen because they are so bright."
5,Superb picture quality,"I received superb video quality from this set of cable, highly recomended for those who has s-video input"
2,Hannah's New Boots,"Hannah's New Boots, by Celia Berridge, made in 1992 is probably not a book I'd recommend for an award, but one rather that would make one smile! A day filled with fun, Hannah experiences different activities with her new red boots, which this little red headed Hannah is enthralled by.At first she experiences the different sounds the shiny boots make, and the appearance. She walks, heel toe, heel toe, up and down the hall feeling the funny, glip-glop. This curious little girl wants more then to see what sounds they make and what they look like, but what they would do if thrown down the trash. Out to play, to eat, and games with her new boots, Hannah experiences the creativity she can have with her new red boots.I think it is just a story that was made to amuse children, not to really teach them a lesson. It's cute and playful, with many emotions included."
4,Mighty Mehldau!,"By far my favorite Brad Mehldau cd. Amazing jazzified ""covers"" (in jazz this is not really the case, since they're more like ""treatments"") of River Man, Exit Music (For A Film); delicious versions of standards, a few Mehldau originals, and poignant ballads.Perfect for every occasion."
5,My favorite Mehldau,"Not sure why Soundlab dissed this so much. I'm a huge fan of Brad, Pat Metheny, Bill Evans, Keith Jarrett and it's not fair to say that he lacks depth or emotion. ""Message sent"" is not always ""message received"".All I can say is that of all my Brad Mehldau albums, this is the one I come back to again and again. Maybe not as often as Keith Jarrett 'The Melody at Night Without You' or the 'Live at the Blue Note' 5-disc box set (which is incredible - a true reference set staple).I never write these reviews and am doing so here because I just got finished listening to 'Songs'. You won't be disappointed - great disc."
5,A great place to start,"After listening and loving Mehldau's entire 'Art of the Trio' series so far, I would say this one is the best, the kind of recording that gets the crown in the Penguin Guide.Mehldau's selection and imaginative treatment of standards and pop material, his own lucid, effortless compositions, his light, clear yet powerful technique and his expressive improvising are at their peak on this CD. His intensity as just as gripping on quiet tunes as on fortissimo ones, and his treatment of ""Young at Heart,"" with his gorgeous and completely sincere little glissandi, is wonderful. Already one of the great jazz pianists of all time. You will looooove this record."
5,4 1/2 stars is 1/2 star too few,"This CD is gorgeous. As other reviews have said, it's introspective and quite emotional. However, lest it seem that this CD is bluntly maudlin, it should be pointed out that each note shimmers with emotion as opposed to dripping with emotion. The rhythm section perfectly complements brad's ideas, keeping the time floating along, never losing sight of the beat but not drilling it into the listener's head either. More than 5 stars."
4,Big Bill's #26 of 2001,"Excellent Jazz masterpiece. Claims it to be a ""one only dream only"". Might be my dream album as well. This is the jazz disc I've been looking for. Straight up with excellent musicians. No electronics and no sonic freak-outs. Recommened for anyone who enjoys good music. On par with ""A Love Supreme""."
3,Sco is great!,"Sco is great. Along with George Benson and Rodney Jones he is one of the funkiest guitarists playing today. I love the way that he does the organ groove thing. This record is one of his best in terms of the groove and straight up funk. My suggestion, get Works For Me, Doing Something by Soulive and Soul Manifesto by Rodney Jones and have a couple of hours to kill. You will be grooved to death!Doctor Jazz"
3,johnnie makes a boo-boo,"i suppose for true jazz fans this recording is pure bliss, it does not however ""work for me"". now-if you want some jamming-try ""bump"" from the same artist."
5,Wonderful Book!,Our almost three year old received this book as a gift for his birthday and he absolutely loves it! This book is so well written and you can't wait to get to the end. A nice read for parents as well! Nicely done!
5,Good,"Vaughn Hamilton was a political wonder. She grew up in the political arena because her father was a judge. All her father ever wanted was for her to make it in the big leagues in politics. Vaughn decided to run for congresswoman. She was running against a despicable man who would do anything to win.Her parents held a fundraiser in her honor and this is where she meets Justin Montgomery. Justin is instantly taken with Vaughn when he is introduced to her by her father Judge Hamilton.Vaughn and Justin literally go through the fire. Justin wants to keep no secrets between them, but Vaughn is determined not to let Justin get to close to her.This was a wonderful story that I have already twice. I re-read it this time to be refreshed for the Sequel Scandalous Affair which I will read next. You can't go wrong with a book written by Donna Hill.If you like this one make sure you get A Private Affair and Pieces of Dreams."
1,Cover only single 20 pound tank,"If this item does become available again you should know this cover is for single tank only. Cover pictured for this item is for two tanks.If you want cover for two tanks, click on other products by Classic & you'll find it.Although cover seems to be made well I gave it a 1 rating because I wanted a cover for two tanks & thought I was getting that because of picture.Maybe I lacked attention to detail when reading description but I think picture confused buying decision."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT!,I rated this product as 1 star only because I HAD to rate it. I actually give it ZERO! We just sat down to make our tile projects for Grandparents... and 4 of the six paints are dried out. The remaining 2 paints are so thick that making an actual design is impossible. I paid $20 plus for this kit and am so angry! I now have to run out to the local craft store to find another project for my children to make for family! What a complete waste!
3,Somewhat Disappointing !!,"I am a huge fan of this writer as a rule but ""Southern Storm"" was not the usual gem of a read Terri Blackstock usually provides. I found it somewhat of a disappointment, I'm sorry to say. I would have given this book 3 1/2 Stars if that were an optiion. The storyline was dragging and lacked the usual snap Terri is so well-known for but I love the characters so even though the plot was at times boring the book is still worth the read. I'd check it out at the library however if they carry it."
2,Will no longer read Blackstock's books.,"I've read three of Terri Blackstocks books and quit in the middle of the third one. Although I love her writing style, I cannot take anymore of the biblical references and quoting of scripture. Enough already!!!!! To think Cade, in ""Southern Storm"" refused to develop a relationship with Blair until she came to know God was rediculous. I feel her books are a reflection of her own views, and that's fine. I will just no longer be reading them."
2,"Too Much References to Praying, Etc.","I ""purchased"" this book because it was a Kindle freebie. Since I had already read the first Cape Refuge book and liked it, I thought this one would also go lightly on the Christian aspect. However, I was VERY wrong! There was way too much emphasis put on God, praying, etc. and not enough emphasis on the story line itself. I skipped over many paragraphs and even pages at a time just to bypass all the unneccesary parts in order to get at the actual story. I gave the book 2 stars simply because the basic story line/concept was good...all the rest, I could do without."
1,I should have read the description more closely,"I mistakenly thought this was a mystery thriller type of fiction. Really it is a Christian (10 more reasons why you should convert) book masquerading as detective fiction. It seems that the story line and plot are forced to try and adhere to the authors underlying desire to explain why we should all be good Christians. I found myself skipping over significant portions of the book, looking for where it would get back to the story. Not a good buy if you are looking for a detective / mystery / thriller - probably a good book if you are looking for Christian literature with a mild story to add interest. I'm sure I would have realized that if I had read a bit more about it before purchasing - so live and learn. The book ends when the Christianity issues are all dealt with - which unfortunatey is before some critical issues relating to closure around plot are resolved."
3,"More or less, same as the first","On one side, there is a decent mystery that pulls you in and keeps you reading.On the other side, is a terrible budding romance between a Christian man and a woman who doesn't believe (oh the horror!). Unfortunately this side is stronger and makes you want to throw your break your brand new kindle into a thousand pieces.I am officially done with this series. Even if the third chapter becomes a free download!"
1,Southern Srorm,One of the worst books I've ever bought.If you are looking for christian values read the bible.
3,Good Book,"Cape Refuge series - Southern Storm book 2 by Terri BlackstockThis was a good book. There was suspense as the Chief of Police Matthew Cade came up missing. Even though most of the town believed he just walked away from his position after hitting a pedestrian and killing him. Blair Owens wouldn't believe that even after evidence showed that most of the town was correct. I enjoyed her character of determination in the midst great opposition. This second book wetted my appetite for the next book. We want light to overcome evil and that's were the next book is headed. I would give this a good rating as I think the characters at times did become unreal. I was able to see things coming so some of the book was not a surprise. Overall I did enjoy Southern Storm but Terry has done much better in her other books.Southern Storm (Cape Refuge, No. 2)"
5,Better than the first!,"Hello,Im an avid reader of Terri Blackstock. As well as Karen Kingsbury, Dee Henderson, and any other author whos writing style strikes my fancy. Southern Storm was a fantastic read. It literally kept me flipping pages till around 1:30 in the morning. The plot keeps adding on to the point where you just can't find a dry spot. This book was better than the first (Cape Refuge was great as well) but it's easier to get into Blair and Cade's character. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Terri Blackstock novels as well as anyone who likes a good read."
3,not the best version of Linux,"Linspire 5.0 is a moderately decent OS. There are some problems with sound that needs to be fixed (mainly when you use Lsongs) It seems a lot of people have had these issues. It is easy to install and CNR makes it easy to find applications. I suggest trying Suse 10.0. It has fewer bugs, just a little more time consuming to install to hard drive. you can buy the retail version with manual and tech support for new users, or download it for free at opensuse.org. I would rank Suse 10.0 over Linspire or Windows"
2,A disappointing and patchy account which omits too much,"Although describing itself as a noble attempt to produce a concise and compelling account of Britain's history in one volume, this book lands wide of its mark. It reads like it was written in a hurry. It begins with a stodgy account of English history through the lives of its kings and queens up to William IV. Thereafter it consists of a series of poorly written essays on various aspects of modern British history. The account of the First World War is dreadful. Its saving grace is the quality and choice of illustrations"
2,A poor story of Britain,"Yet again we have a book that confuses England with Britain, with virtually no reference to pre-1707 Wales, and a token reference to Scottish history.This is a pity as Roy Strong writes well and of course there can be no doubt that the history of English Kings and Queens is a glorious one.For a more honest account of the history of this fascinating island, read the Oxford History of Britain."
1,not good service.,"ordered it three weeks ago, at least, still have not received it. don't even want it now.Regardsdennis"
1,UNREALISTIC,"This book is full of exaggerations about Turkey. No wonder that the author has spent ``a month per year'' there in the last dozen years or so... The Turkey described by this book belongs to the 1970's and not so much to the dynamic society of the 1990's. If you read this book, the REAL Turkey (as it actually exists) will be a pleasant surprize to you. So read it and go there and have a real shock! Turkey is a modern democratic society with Western values which at the same time keeps the cultural heritage of the Caucasus, Siberia, Balkans, ancient Anatolia, the Ottomans, the Byzantines etc"
1,Terrible...,"I resent the writer with all my heart, everything written here is totally UNREALISTIC and WRONG. As a Germany-born Turk, I cannot understand why Arin Bayraktaroglu could be so utterly biased and narrow-minded. The book does nothing but mislead the reader. It is quite upsetting to think that probably readers who don't know much about modern and democratic Turkey will believe some things in it and build a wrong opinion. The best thing is to ignore this, or come visit Turkey on a holiday and see the modern, European, and REAL country. I would have given 0 stars to this if it were an option. --"
1,Strange,"I was suprised to notice that the writer has a Turkish name. In my opinion, the book was a little 'distant' from reality, many things were exaggerated and untrue generalisations."
3,"Good movie, Bad quality","This is a good movie, but the quality of the DVD is pretty abysmal. I was expecting a higher quality picture. The subtitles are not very well done either, with many misspellings and some parts not subtitled at all. I hope to find more of Shah Rukh Khan's earlier movies put onto quality DVDs in the future."
5,You Can Be Great!,"God's desire is that each one of us do something great with our lives is the premise from which the book emerges. Jesus taught the principle of greatness and, in fact, lived it so we would have a model. Hutchcraft calls it the ""magnificent obsession"" that comes from the heart of God into your heart. It's an eternal rescue mission, aimed at doing God's will in your life.You are God's assigned representative where He has placed you. You touch people that others do not influence. God placed you where you are to help some of the people there go to heaven. We are His messengers of reconciliation, according to 2 Corinthians 5:19. This book shows you how significant your life is to God's plan and to other people. It will encourage you."
5,Journey,Just what I needed to keep me going in the right direction. Possitive inspiration. Taking a moment to be grateful.
5,I loved this book. I have given as a gift several times. FYI my name is Faye Mowry. Acc. In franks name,I was looking for something to inspire me for my daily living. It was recommended by a yoga teacher of mine. It has helped to realize that change comes within not by others changing. I will continue to recommend it to others who are searching .
5,Great daily affirmations!,Got this book after it was read out loud in a yoga class. Great uplifting reflections for everyday! Great buy
5,Great Book,"I had her first book and really like it, but this one is better! The entries are short, but are incredibly motivational and offer a great deal of food for thought. They are a perfect way to end the day on a positive note! I would reccommend this to anyone."
4,Satisfactory transaction,"Merchandise purchased in this transaction was received before anticipated and in the condition promised. The price was reasonable, as well."
2,mensa ain't what it's cracked up to be,"This is an average puzzle book with some fatuous, silly remarks about the true nature of genius thrown in. If this is the best that the high IQ crowd can come up with, God help us all."
1,Disappointing,"This is the first book I have ever seen that includes a ""spatial"" section with questions that involve arithmetic, the alphabet, and other logical classification questions that involve no spatial abilities. It's really quite sad.As a book revealing genius, it's a failure, and, as my previous comments indicate, the included tests are inadequate.It's actually quite disturbing that a society like Mensa has developed such a poor thinking/I.Q./puzzle book like this (amongst a few others as well)."
1,Hello above ^^^^^^^^,"Are you serious! Go to just about any computer store and by the 3 ft cable for ($) and spend the other 18 bucks (plus S&H) elseware. You won't get faster speeds, better compression, more chicks, or even laid with these or any other cables."
3,Nice Clock but too loud,"Bought this about a year ago because it looked special and all the good reviews here. And it is indeed functional and good look on the wall. But a few things could be changed:(1) not a big issue but the finish is not as good as it pictured in Amazon, it is a bit pale looking as if it had been exposed to heavy rain for days.(2) not a big issue but the back of the clock is exposed. I'd prefer it were enclosed to keep out the dust during long term usage.(3) The chiming is off during the night and starts again as early as 5:45 AM and wake everyone up. It would be nice if the start time could be adjusted.(4) Even the lowest volume is still too loud. I have to turn it off. This is the biggest issue for me. The sound quality is good and music is beautiful but I have to forget about it for now until I figure out a way to lower the volume to desired level."
5,LOVE THIS CLOCK,THIS CLOCK IS GORGEOUS. THE WESTMINSTER CHIMES ARE WONDERFUL. I NEVER HAD A CHIME CLOCK BEFORE ---AND I AM VERY HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS ONE. THE CHIMES ARE VERY SOOTHING AND THERE IS A VOLUME ADJUSTMENT AND 4 DIFFERENT CHIMES TO CHOOSE FROM --INCLUDING AVA MARIA.I HAVE IT IN MY KITCHEN AND HAVE GOTTEN MANY COMPLIMENTS ON IT.HOPE IT LASTS MANY YEARS!!!
4,Wall clock,Very good quality and is accurate. A little confusing on how to sync chimes with the time and no second hand.
5,Great canoeing vest,"First used one of these vests on a wilderness canoe trip with my son's scout troop in 1992. Liked it so much I bought my own soon afterward. I just ordered a second one. The panel that goes down the back is only 8 inches wide, it is open on the sides of the back so I stay cool. (PFDs that encircle the body make me sweaty when paddling all day.) Adjust the straps (my original has laces) on the sides the first time, and from then on just use the zipper. The pad on the back of the neck is nice for portaging. I don't use it for kayaking, as the seat back on the kayak hits the back of this pfd. The color is more orange than it looks in the pic on the website, but it's not a horrible bright orange. I have a half dozen PFDs but this is one I grab for canoeing. Love this vest."
4,Other reviewers are off the mark,"I got this for Lily was here. But some of the other material grew on me. There's a couple of funky jazz masterpieces on here. I really dig the whole CD now. But warning, her song Lily was here is kind of unique, her other stuff is not the same kind of ethereal masterpiece. I don't know or care whether she plays sax as well as other top performers..."
2,It's NOT the Best of Candy,"Sorry to write that this album was disappointing. It was not in the true form of Candy doing her thang! I was expecting great jazz/funk/fusion as Candy can do so well, but instead I got mediocre stuff, just ramblings to me. The title is deceptive because it certainly was not the Best of Candy Dulfer! Hope the next Candy CD I buy will be better."
2,watered down Jazz,she plays sax alright but the music is lacking personality.aside from Lily was here with Dave Stewart this disc is hurting for good material.she did some stuff with Prince but this disc as is the case with the rest of her music is that it's on the Kenny G tip.watered down Jazz with no feeling or emotion.
2,A so-so recording by a so-s- artist,"And then there is Barry. He says ""Lily Was Here"" may be the best jazz song of all-time. My, my... I guess that is the first ""jazzy' type song he's every heard.Candy Dulfer is just a pretty face who plays sax tolerably well and has a few good licks scattered here and there throughout her recordings. Kind of like seashells scattered on the world's beaches, there is a gem here and there for Candy, but she isn't going to be a long term player as one of the jazz giants.RAE"
1,not phillipines brand,"just recieved my order and it royal brand mangoes, have had them before and they suck. sending back,"
2,Sweet like Candy,"If candied fruit suits your taste, Phillippine Brand Mangoes are perfect. However, with 32G of Sugars, it is too sweet for us - practically resembling candied-mangoes, if there is such a thing. Plus, according to the packaging, these mangoes are NOT organic, and subjectively written, ""The Best Tasting Mango in the World.""On the upside, this fruit is mostly non-acidic, soft, and very moist. There were no pieces to discard; all were evenly colored and of apparently high quality despite the high sugar content.In comparison, we enjoyKlein's Naturals Mango, Organic, (Pack of 6)orSunridge Farms Organic Mango Slices, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)which taste like more like natural fruit, instead of candy.However, YOU be the judge since virtually all tastebuds are biased."
1,Purchase at Costco for much less!,"These are some of our family's favorite dried fruit products -- 5 stars for the product itself. HOWEVER, you can purchase the same 30 oz. size at Costco for much less. We live in southern California where prices are higher than much of the United States, and I can get one bag at Costco for $10.99. I'm amazed that Amazon does not have very competitive prices anymore for many products like they used to."
2,It's sweetened which is not what I expect.,It's sweetened. the sugar added actually remove the natural fun taste of mango.and I couldn't find if it's sweetened in it's description.Anybody want the natural taste of dried mango should go away from this one.
5,Delicious Mangoes..,"I first tried Philippine Brand Dried Mangoes while visiting the Philippines. After tasting this product, I feel without a doubt that this is the original Philippine Brand Naturally Delicious Dried Mangoes. They are are moist and so delicious it's hard to stop eating. This brand tastes like natural tree ripened mangoes, moist enough to be chewy but not dry like jerky. The 30 ounce bag is tightly packed with this wonderful product. If you're looking for a healthy fat free snack, give these a try. If you love mangoes, you won't be sorry.Nutrition FactsServing Size: 1.5oz.

2,Overpriced too sweet,"The mangoes were not what i expected, i buy these products so often and this time there were too sweet and really overpriced I was expecting a bigger bag for the price i paid. ZI am really not pleased"
3,Warning red before buying Mis-leading product info!,"First off, I love Phillippine brand dried Mangoes. Too bad these were Royal Phillippine dried mangoes. NOT THE SAME THING. The picture for this product is what I wanted to order. I received something different. The Royal dried mangoes i received were very similar but not as good and more importantly not what I ordered. After trying a few I noticed that they weren't as good so I checked me orders to make sure I purchased what I thought I purchased. The picture was what I ordered but under description they say ""Royal Brand Naturally Delicious Dried Mangoes from the Philipines are without a doubt the best tasting..."" So the picture they advertise is for Phillippine dried mangoes but under product description its a different brand called Royal. Mangoes are still good but not what I ordered. Disappointed with seller eauction for not clearly advertising product."
2,Philippine Brand Mangoes WARNING!,If you're looking for a healthy snack this is NOT it. It's loaded with refined sugar and has sulphur dioxide(artificial food preservative) which is not listed in the amazon product description. You can actually taste the sugar more than the mango itself.
1,Great (But not always),"Great product (usually)We have ordered this bag of dried mangoes repeatedly. Every time there were wonderful. Until the last one. Inside were spoiled, dark mangeo slices, nothing like the usual quality. Anyway, that happens once in a while with every food product. We returned them. Apple paid the shipping (as in product defective.) What I am waiting to see is how the seller deals with this return. This wasn't a shipping issue. The package arrived promptly and was sealed. Anyway, stay tuned. I'll revise the ""stars"" rating if ""Internet Seller"" follows up as it should."
4,Awesome Mangoes!,"I must admit, I have a hard time controlling myself when I eat these. I usually put away a bag in 3 days with restraint! I'm a mango lover who usually plans my yearly Mexico vacation around mango season.4 stars for the occasional stringy seed part you may get and the high sugar content (one reason they are so good though) Pretty consistent quality, I've bought 6 or 8 bags in the last 6 months."
4,Really tasty!,"These mangos are delicious, but pack a lot of added sugar and preservatives. These things are like candy they taste so good."
3,Needs a little improvement,"I want to like this, but it has some flaws.1)The pocket is on the wrong side. the tether needs to be on the same ide as the pocket so when you tie it to you float you can reach whats in it.2)It is hard to clean I had a Cool Float brand floating cooler (That was stolen at the river MAN I LOVED THAT FLOAT) and it had a removable air bladder that made it much easier to clean. Also the cupholders fill up with all kinds of dirt and grime and it is impossable to get out.3)The graphics are annoying and a little tacky4)The cooler doesn't strap tothe base. It is held in by friction, and tends to pop out a lot."
5,Works great!!,"My husband and I have a pond that we swim and float in almost everynight. We got tired of having to get out and get something to drink all the time so I ordered this for him for our anniversary. We filled it with our drinks and ice and hooked it to his Airhead chair float and it worked great. The temps were in the 90's and the ice stayed all afternoon. The cooler part is great and being able to float and have your drink so handy was fun. Would defiantly recommend purchasing and would purchase again. Got great service, it arrived in a few days."
5,Drink Up!,This floating cooler is well made and appears durable. The float is thick and can take the abuse of your drunk friends.so drink up and enjoy!
5,Just what I needed,"Went river tubing last summer and looked around for a floating cooler to bring. Glad I ended up getting this one...worked perfectly. Just tied it to my tube (there's a hook on the cooler for tying string) and towed it behind me. I liked that the cooler portion detaches from the float...makes it easier to stock and transport. By the end of the 3 hours our ice was mostly melted, but to be honest we weren't super careful about zipping it back up every time someone took a beer. We fit a good amount of beer too, probably about 24 like it says (I think including the outside cupholders). It's still in good shape and we plan to use it on another tubing trip this summer!"
5,Great Cooler!,"Bought this to go with my 6 person inflatable island, and it is everything I expected. I'm a little skeptical about the 24-pack rating, I think that is without ice, but that's probably for the better anyway! Here's to a sunburned summer!"
3,Aqua Oasis for the pool,"I bought one for me and one for a gift. Mine works fine, but the one I bought for a gift won't hold air. I felt bad. So 1/2 of the order worked."
5,Bad as$ cooler,"If you want to float and also be close to your drinks this is the cooler for you. I've used it several times either tubing down the Delaware River or just floating on the lake off a boat. It holds your beers and keeps em cool, definitely can fit a 24 pack with ice and maybe a few more. The beer holders are nice especially when you are moving on some water. I also like that the middle part comes right out of the float-able part and you can use that as a regular cooler on land as well. All around a solid design and in my opinion superior to the blue and white initex floating cooler that I also have used. Well worth the money"
5,Great for the lake...a real hit for father's day,The softsided cooler keeps ice and drinks cold for an extended period. Easy to load up then put in the float on the water. Can handle a heavy load with ease. Ability to tie a line to the cooler is key.
4,A great floating bar,"Floating on a raft on a warm sunny day is only made better by this floating bar, especially when you have a cooler to keep your drinks cold. What more can one ask for?"
5,The Coolest Cooler,"If you're thinking about purchasing a cooler for your next tubing trip, this is the one! It holds a large number of adult beverages and keeps them cold even when it's 90+ degrees outside. It's durable and hangs right in there with the ""bartender"" of the trip. It's a must have!"
5,Love it!,"This is my second one as we misplaced the first one. Perfect for floating anywhere! I've had this on the beach, on the river and in the pool. Plenty large to fit drinks and snacks for our group of 4. Floats great no matter how full/heavy you pack it. Made of heavy plastic so no worries about leaks when it gets dragged to the gravel bar. We use the cooler alone as well. Soft sides make it easy to pack, it basically can collapse to the size of whatever is inside. Highly recommend this!"
5,"Terrific book, unique insights","Chinese Students Encounter America is really a treasure. The anecdotes of foreign students as they experience, confront, and cope with education and life in America are priceless. The translation is very well-done. For those who are interested in Chinese-American relations, modern Chinese history, or the foreign student experience in America, this is a very interesting and unique vantage point."
1,all thumbs down,My wife and I did not like this CD. I took it to work and had seven co-workers play it. All were in agreement that money should not be spent on this CD. We think this was a sound track for a TV special and the beef was in what the viewer saw and less so in what the viewer heard. A CD like The Gift has the beef in what you hear (we can not watch CDs yet) so buy the Gift or Once Upon a Christmas but pass this one by for another.
4,heart warming,it was a great cd that was very crisp and high quality.i am awaiting his next release.thanks kenny.
2,Buy a cheap used copy just for some laughs,"This CD is good for a few laughs. Buy a used copy for a cheap price, give it to a Kenny Rogers fan as a gift, and watch his or her expression as they listen to some of these songs, especially the ones where the kids rap or where they imitate the voices of various toys. Around Christmastime I enjoy playing a few of these songs for guests simply because they induce stares of confusion and are so dad-gum corny. And aren't we supposed to get a little corny at Christmastime?"
5,Being a Child of God - excellent discipleship material.,I am using this book as a Sunday School curriculum presently. I have great respect for Wiersbe and have come to really appreciate his ability to explain the Christian life into an understandable format. The illustrations that Wiersbe uses throughout the book keep the Christian life fresh. The book has been an encouragement to my personal devotional life and I am looking forward to seeing how it might be used in the life of our Adult Sunday School Class.
3,It's not bad...,"I ordered this because my 10 year old really wanted it. He seems to like it so far. He's done the work out, maybe 5 times since he got the DVD. It seems to be a pretty good workout for him, he sweats, and comments that some of the moves are hard.I have only two issues. One, I wish they had done a better job of showing proper form for some of the excersises to help prevent strains and injury. Two, even my son thought that a comment made in the DVD, about the weight of one of the kids working out with the ""workout kid"", was a little mean.Overall, I think it's OK, but not great."
5,This is a great workout for parents too..,"My son watched the youtube videos and got inspired, I ordered him the dvd and he's getting in shape. I could only last 5 min before CJ wore me out."
3,Getting the Carpathian Ambiance,"I recently travelled in the Carpathians and read this book while travelling. It gives one a good sense of what this area was like 100 years ago, particularly the thinking of the people. Jules Verne's prescience is impressive"
1,Skip it.,"Having read short reviews of this book, I expected an undiscovered gem, Jules Verne's take on DRACULA, and found it instead slight and tedious, a short story worth of drama drawn out to 190 pages. It's easy to make this sound interesting, being about the clash of superstition and technology, set around a mysterious castle the locals believe haunted. But don't be fooled. This may have a bit of ""gothic"" atmosphere, but to present-day readers it does not deliver on its supernatural aura. Today, this is a footnote, interesting mainly for the 19th century description of still uninvented, but now commonplace, technology."
1,Amazon mistake,"This is NOT the cd that Amazon lists. If you order it, as I did, you get a cd called Rock in a Blues Place from a guy named Steve Fister, not the Kelly Keeling cd entitled Giving Sight to the Eye. Why Amazon continues to list these two cd's incorrectly, even after they have been notified of the error, is an absolute mystery."
4,Pleasant,"If you enjoy British TV shows, this is on par with ""Keeping up Appearances"" and ""To the Manor Born"" but below ""Fawlty Towers"". It is light entertainment, and I found the subject matter, which makes fun of the Catholic Church, to be non offensive."
3,Entertaining,"I purchased this because I am a fan of a certain British comedy and at the bottom of the page it said that people who enjoy that comedy also bought this series. So, what the heck, I gave it a try.For the most part I can say that it is often disgusting, but oddly entertaining at the same time. My son and I watch it togther and we have had a few belly laughs, even though it is really off beat. We find ourselves quoting the show at odd times and laughing, so I am glad that I bought it even though I hesitate to recommend it (or even admit I watch it, lol)."
5,One of the funniest shows I have ever seen!,"I only heard about Father Ted a few months ago, some friends of mine in Ireland told me about it so I thought I would check it out. It turned out to be one of the funniest things I have ever seen. If you are a fan of Monty Python or Pink Panther(the movies with Peter Sellers, not the cartoon) or even Mel Brooks. Then you'll love Father Ted, goofy and subtle humor in every episode. I highly reccomend this to everyone!!!"
5,Still waiting...,"6 months and many emails later... NOTHING. I'm still waiting for this set to be delivered and the only change has been the price tag slowly going up every month. ;oPAnyway, I've seen them all on TV and it kicks ass. Maybe one day I can see it in DVD clarity when Amazon.ca does something about this back-order lag..."
5,Ted! They Put it on DVD Ted!,"Now neither too small nor too far away, we Americans can enjoy Ted and Dougal, Mrs. Doyal and Fr. Jack with a nice cup of tea. Brilliant Ted!"
2,Tiny Teapot,I was very disappointed when I got this product. I should have realized the dimensions were not listed in the description. This teapot looks like it belongs in a dollhouse not a kitchen! It is beautifully made but the picture displayed is 10x bigger than it is I collect teapots and this one gets lost!
1,Wrist Blood Presssure Machine Oregon Scientific Monitor,I loved the large digital print but was unhappy it was not calibrated correctly. I had to send it to Oregon Scientific for a replacement or repair.
4,Accurate Monitoring,We got this machine and my Husband promptly took it into our Doctors office to make sure of the accuracy. It is spot on and very easy to use.
1,Junk,If I could give this zero stars I would. Save your money. Bought this from QVC. It broke within a month. Wrist band popped open every time I tried to take my reading. I have small wrists 6 1/2 inches and it wouldn't stay closed. Took very poor reading when you were able to get one. Not accurate. Piece of junk. Go with an omron.
1,DOA: Dead On Arrival,"I bought this device 12 months ago. The calibration was accurate and the functions are helpful, however, upon arriving at the 12 month of owning the device it started giving an Error 8 message. After consulting the owners manual I tried changing the batteries and repositioning the unit several times. It has since become clear to me that the unit is indeed dead on arrival at the expiration of its 12 month warranty. On the plus side, it does make a rather interesting looking, although expensive paperweight."
3,Company very hard to contact!! No e mail works no phone !!,"While I am pleased with the unit , If one has some questions about the unit monitor . Cannot get intouch with them. And there e mail. Does not work ! And they don't respond to there e mail address I found and sent them a e mail about Monitor . I cannot rest the memory and or rest set the time and date to correct settings. I got no reply to the 3 e mails I did send!. Yet if you place a order for a monitor of theres that goes thur fine. But when A customer needs to contact cutomer services forget about it.!"
3,Quick and Easy,"Positioning is important, but once you understand that this unit is convient and easy to use."
4,good quality,I am happy with the quality and the craftsmanship. But I was a little shock and disappointed to see the real bag's color (orange) was not as bright as it was shown on the website...t is more like a muddy orange. Good size and useful and it fits a lot of stuff and still maintain its shape. I like it overall. I am a fan of NOVICA. They have very good ratings. The art is unique and the products have good quality. The con is the shipment takes too long....
5,great service,"book came in great condition and fast shipping. like new,i worked for saul bass in 1968 and lost my copy of the book until i found it on amazon"
3,It's a little on the brief side...,"This book focuses entirely on Marshal Villars during the War of the Spanish Sucession (1701-1714), a useful antidote to the usual attention to Marlborough. Unfortunately there are no maps, making it difficult to understand the descriptions of the battles and campaigns. There is little description of any of the personalities involved other than Villars, both problems lowering my rating of this book."
4,Exhaust Tip,"I could not use the tip becuse the inlet was just to small fir my 3"" exhaust, but it is a well built tip that will last a while under the harsh conditions it will be in. If anyone needs this tip leyt me know. Im selling it."
3,Good as far as Cd Wallets go,Cd Wallets are Cd wallets so it was great for what it is. There's not much to say about it except for it looks good and it holds Cd's
2,"Love the watch, hate how it falls apart","I love the looks of this watch -- sporty, but not as bulky as most running watches. I wear it all the time. However. . . this is the 4th one I have bought. I like it so much I keep hoping I'll get one that lasts. Two of them have had the ""stop"" and ""start"" buttons fall off and one of them had the band disattach itself. I have not mistreated my watches. There seems to be an inherent flaw. I am about to mail all three bad ones back to Nike and see what they have to say for themselves. Your price is great -- hope I get my money's worth out of this one."
2,Why Is She The Princess of Drum Solos?,"She has no rhythm. Watch her when she's doing simple 4/4 movements. She doesn't hit the beat. All her drum solos are canned and have probably been spoon fed to her, as she does the same thing every time. This is the routine she calls an ""improvisation"" at every show.I give this DVD two stars because I learned one combination from her, and learned two moves by watching her take lessons from the real stars for thirty seconds. Incidentally, the music they chose for the Cairo sequence sounds Turkish to me...but I wouldn't commit myself either way. This DVD is worth renting or borrowing if you can get your hands on it, but until they start selling them used for four dollars, go buy something else."
4,GOOD INFORMATIVE DVD FOR BEGINNERS ON DRUM SOLOS.,THIS DVD WAS WHAT I WAS EXPECTING SONIA & ISSAM WHERE GREAT INBREAKING DOWN THE STEPS AND PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE DRUMTECHNIQUE.SONIA IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES IN THE BELLYDANCE SUPERSTARS.I REALLY GIVE IT A THUMBS UP.
4,Bellydance - The Art of the Drum Solo,"très bien,mais j'aurai voulu voir plus de démonstration de la part du derboukiste,tant pis ce sera pour une autre fois je l'espère.à bientt."
5,Great for even an intermediate dancer,"I absolutely love this dvd and bonus cd. Sonia and Issam make a great pair for instruction. Excellent breakdown of both drum beats and movements. I am an intermediate dancer..I had choreographed a drum solo, but was stuck on one part. I got great ideas to finish my choreography with this video. I totally reccomend this for everyone, worth every penny."
4,"Ok, not as good as some, but could be better","Drum solos to me are terrifying as there is so much to them, and the horror of repeating a step too many times or starting out too strong and having no where to go encouraged me to try a video. It doesn't explain things as well as I would like, but its better than some (cough*Rania* what on earth is she doing?!!) The extra clips are fun as well!"
4,Muy bueno!,"Es un video al que se le puede sacar mucho provecho. No solamente te provee los pasos para bailar al ritmo de la percusion, sino que te explica los diferentes ritmos. Tambien se incluye un cd con musica de tabla solo para practicar por tu cuenta. Es un buen video aunque recomiendo mucho mas otro que se llama ""The Heartbeat of Bellydance"". Si usted es como yo, los querra los dos. Si debe escoger solo uno... yo voy por el otro."
3,One retarded camera man,I'm subtracting two stars because you can't learn the technique and choreograph if the camera is focusing on the stomach and constantly changing angles. Where's the feet?!?!? Good technique and choreograph that is suitable for intermediate. Nothing too out-of-the-box. Sonia is very mellow and not enthusiastic in front of the camera. Some may find her boring and others may like her shy presence because it shows that you don't have to be extremely bubbly to dance. Good bonus CD.
3,Okay - not great,"I bought this DVD looking for some fresh choreography / combinations to use with drum solos; both for routines and improvising in restaurant performances. I have to agree with one of the other reviewers - Sonia's on-camera personality is lifeless and not at all motivating. Most of the technique is beginner-level; they could have added some layering or ideas to spice it up for the intermediate / advanced dancer.While I liked the idea of the bonus CD, I'm not able to find the choreographed routine music on it...??? Perhaps it's spliced from several of the cuts on the CD, I'm not completely sure yet. I also liked how the drummer explained the rhythms and gave the dumbek pronunciation for each. Producers - take note - it's extremely annoying to put in all the work in learning a routine, and then not be able to find the music to which it should be performed!!! Please please give us title and artist, and if you're going to edit the piece, include it with the video."
2,Not bad but nothing special,"It's an okay beginner video. Some combinations are useful, others are too basic. My biggest complaint is that the dvdis intensely B O R I N G, I nearly fell asleep!!!!!.... Sonia is either very shy orstressed about reading off the tele-prompter, she doean't smile, looks away, looks tired, she seems to be ""marking"" the movements rather than actually performing them. What I mean is that there is no energy in her body when she teaches, she's limp, it's better in the performance secttion of the dvd (only slightly), but she still looks unhappy, like she is trying hard to remember what to do next. I don't get the movement when I don't see it performed the way it should look in a performance, and if I know the movement, I don't know how I can improve it because there is no challenge here. I LOVE drum solos, but this dvd is not for me. The Syrian drummer who accompanies Sonia is good, but I bought this dvd to practice dancing, not to enjoy the drumming."
3,Drum solo,"This was a nice video, the explanations were excellent and Sonia and Issam worked very well together. the bonus CD was fun too."
4,"Fun to Watch, Informative","Not only is the instructor a talented dancer, her drummer also reviews different beats - important if you'd like to choreograph a dance in the future."
2,Great Drummer * Mediocre Dancer,"Great drummer and useful info about Arabic rhythms, but Sonia is a very medicore dancer.I was surprised, then not surprised that Sonia was chosen for this teaching DVD as it appears she is Miles Copeland's favorite dancer. She is gorgeous, but by far the least talented of all the Belly Dance Superstars.Was she chosen for her beauty?Was her fee less than the other dancers would charge for making this DVD?This might be a good teaching tape for beginners though and the CD music included is a nice bonus."
3,way too self indulgent.,"If you are reading the series, then you will have to read ""Reads"" unless you have given up already. The continuation of the Cerebus storyline is only a part of the contents of ""Reads"" and is worth reading. There are several revelations in ""Reads"" that are pivotal to the storyline. The rest of ""Reads"" is a barely coherent narrative that serves as ""insight"" (?) into the background and mind of the author. There are several interesting points made within the text, such as a discussion of ""birth vs death"" (which I think came out of a converation with Kevin Smith) and the nature of stories (from a conversation with Alan Moore), but most of the text is irrelevant to anything but the world of comic books - oh, sorry....""graphic novels""...and far too self indulgent to contribute to the artistry of Cerebus. I am obliged to mention that friends of mine think ""Reads"" is a genius masterpiece, so you will probably either love it or hate it........."
2,deal breaker,"not only did the tone of this book totally turn me off, but - let's be honest - if i want to read a book, i will buy one. i have heard there are millions of them; some quite good even. but when i buy a comic book, i would like words associated with pictures - not just words for many, many pages. stopped reading cerebus after this one - which is a shame, as i liked it a lot up to here."
1,Weak because so much is not comics,"The weaknes of this book (and sections of Ricks Story) is not its controversial content but the fact that Sim basically rejects the comics format (which he does well) for page after page of dense badly written (though not as bad as the section in Ricks Story)prose with a single illo per page. If this dialogue was writtten and presented in a comics format it would have been hopefully stripped down ,edited and more readable . As it is it is a real slog and not really worth the effort. A real mess."
4,Hilarious anti-woman manifesto,"There is so much truth being spoken by Dave Sim in this Reads section of the 300 issue Cerebus epic that it is worth wading your way through the boring parts. Sim brings the epic battle against the Feminists to a close with a manifesto where he depicts men as the light and women as the void that swallows up the light.As a philosophy, there are some contridictions, but as a rant it is quite interesting. With this issue, Sim lost over half of his large readership. In this modern age of political correctness, that artistic courage should be applauded whether or not you agree with the opinion."
2,NOT USER FRIENDLY,"The visuals are good but the menu is just to ""play feature"", then it starts with the jazz music and the shadow musicians and dancers later. It continues with other songs and goes back and forth between musicians and dancers. You cannot select tracks! All the music is on track 1 and it just continues. If you select track 2 or 3 it is the screen colorful visuals but they only play for about 1 minute.This would have been much better if you had a menu to select each track or screen visual. The music isnt that good either. Track one is about a UFO. This disc is just ok. I wont use it."
4,Lookin' for Luv,First and foremost let me say this was a fantastic book. The characters are dealing with real situations and problems. They also have different personalties and true ove for each other. They go through many hardships that makes you feel what they feel and the go through good times that will have you lol(laughing out loud). this book has and excelent plot that hooks you from the beginning of the book till the very end. Once you start to think you know the outcome of a situation you end up for a big surprise. I would recommend this book to a person that loves to laugh and loves a good novel.
4,Good Reading!!,This book was based on 4 men and what they go through in life as they mature and find love down the road. It was very interesting seeing all the road blocks that were put up and what the men did to get out of the situation. The book has a nice ending and Maurice definitely gets what he deserves at the end. I would have liked to know what happened when Maurice found out the situation he put himself into at the end. This book is a definite page turner.
5,BOY OH BOY DID I ENJOY THIS BOOK,"WHAT A PAGE TURNER. The book is awesome, it is full with drama. It has been a long long time since I read a book that kept me up at night. Carl, you are truly a very talented individual and I can't wait for your next book, hurry up please, I don't have anything to read. Thanks Antionette Jorge for recommending such a great great book to me."
5,Look No More.....,"Carl Weber has really done it with this book. It was refreshing to read the male point of view. If you are looking for a good and easy read this is the book. I read this book in 2 days and that's b/c I had to work, and sleep......lolIts funny, juicy, scandelous and the characters I can identify with. Get your credit card and buy it now...."
5,Lookin for luv,I never got into books until I read this one. It was a piece of work. I loved this book and I recommend it highly. From begining to end it is a great book. I have read all of Carl Webers books except a dollar and a dream which is next on my list. You really get into the characters and get excited while reading it. Please if you want a good book run and get this one because it is definetly worth the money and the time invested.
2,Looking for a real book,NOT AGAIN! Okay yes it was semi funny!!! But it was so soft and so predictable it was like an episode of The Jerry Springer show.
2,Yeah...In ALL The Wrong Places,"The book had its good points. However, the character that proved to be the most interesting was the one who was most warped. It had some interesting plot twists, but all in all was incredibly predictable. I figured out Shawna's secret as soon as she and Antoine hit it off so well.Had the book been solely about Maurice, five stars wouldn't have been enough to rate it with."
5,"DESERVES A ""10"" STAR!","Filled with so much drama, your head will be spinning, Carl Weber has unleashed one of the most entertaining and character driven stories I've read in a while.Skillfully crafted and cleverly written, Weber takes you into the lives of 3 friends who had always said ""never"" to using a 1-900 number. When one of the three men set up their 1-900 BLACK LUV message, the calls begin and the heat is turned up to HELL. Folks fall in love, others are cheated on....and the list goes on. Page after page, chapter after chapter, while you can't necessarily predict the next fiasco, you are keenly aware that drama and ""more drama"" will unfold as relationships develop and folks get crossed up in a pot full of mess bound to have you choking with laughter.If you are looking for a fast paced and fullfilling story with all loose ends tied...............Lookin' For Luv is sure to scratch that itch you've been trying to reach!Read and enjoy booklovers................."
5,Lookin'for Luv,"This is a really good book. There were humurous parts of the book which was a delight. I think the author explored the maturity as well as the immaturity of the characters very well. The addiction issue was another one that was explored in different ways. Mr. Weber showed that there are several different types of addictions, not just the one to drugs.I would have liked to have seen more about Antoine and Keisha. I think Keisha's character is much more complex than what was written. Her complexity was alluded to but not explored as much as I would have liked.Great first effort."
3,local interest,"Nicely written! Since I reside in the area that the book is based on, it was interesting and fun to be able to relate to the locations that Carl Weber referred to in the book. The book shows that the old cliche is true....""you can't judge a book by looking at it's cover"". What just dessert that Maurice winds up with just who he deserved."
4,GREAT!,"I AM DEFINETLY A CARL WEBER FAN, AND WONT THINK TWICE BEFORE PURCHASING HIS BOOKS. BUT THIS ONE LACKED THE USUAL CARL WEBER EDGE, AS I CALL IT. BUT IT WAS GOOD."
5,Looking for Love not no more!!!,This is a good read the characters are so funny and unique. Carl Weber can be the voice of a middle age married African American male one minute then the next a single white twenty something female. Lookin for luv is definitely the unexpected it does not have one dull moment.
5,Lookin for something Good to read,well this is it . A very funny and entertaining novel. KUDOS to mr.Weber for a fine novel.
2,Just Another Fairytale!,"I must say...this book was fun to read. I loved all the drama and the build-up of the plot in the story. I was very into this book, however, I think the book went south towards the end. It lacked reality. This book is great if you want to escape into a fantasy world where everything is perfect. Unfortunately, we don't live in such a world, so the book really was very out-of-touch with reality. I don't know where these perfect people live--with their perfect lives and happy endings, but it was entertaining being a part of their ""little world"" temporarily."
1,Nothing Exciting,"I am HUGE fan of Carl Weber. I have read most of his book. But this book was totally...cheesy and not at all well written in my opinion. I was bored from the very beginning. The characters were so immature. The storyline was not at all captivated. Although I read the entire book, I did not enjoy it all. Don't waste your time with this one. Carl has plenty of fantastic books, but this is definitely not one of them."
5,Cool gadget for the engineering geek,"I bought this for my boss for this year's Secret Santa exchange. He is into gadgets and engineering stuff and this was right up his alley. It is totally useless to be sure, but it is very cool. It bounces around all spaz-like and you just want to pull its head off to see it go again. It's been a hit at the office. I wouldn't recommend it for a child as it is kind of fragile and I can see that my 6 year old would destroy it in a matter of seconds."
5,HEAVEN IN A LEMON!,"I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO! It smells wonderful, is rich and thick and always wakes me up in my morning shower. I have tried quite a few of the Philosophy 3 in one products - and this is one of my favorites!"
5,Philosophy products are wonderful!,I think Philosophy bath products are the best I have ever used. They just create a relaxing sensation every time you bathe.
3,The Best of The Bunch,Although it is not saying much when the rest of the bunch smelt like plastic and worse. After smelling this one I might try it in a desperate moment. I was really sad because it sounds like it would be wonderful. I was so hopeful for a cheap alternative to some of my other soaps. I guess I am just an expensive gal.
4,Four Large family stories all in one book!,"Let me tell you, if you ever wanted to read more than one Large family story, this is a great solution. I could see that the father elephant, Mr. Large, was just as strict with the children as Mrs. Large. The only problem is that Mr. Large in charge is not included in this set, but I can buy that book anyway. Still, this is a wonderful book about the adventures of the Large Family. I can't wait to buy Mr. Large in charge as well."
3,"A Review of ""A Quiet Night In""","This book by Jill Murphy is cute in it's way. Certainly the artwork is warm and cuddly, but the subject of sleepy parents was just a no-go for my children (boy and girl; 3 and 5).It's not them, afterall, that are dragging after a long day of play and work. Thus they just couldn't find the humor in the story of parents falling asleep when they were hoping to have a private, adult-only, celebration of father's birthday.Three Stars. Not the best read-aloud. Artwork is nice, with colorful but muted palette. The problem with this book is that the topic is not one children (my children at least) can identify with; thus not of much interest."
5,Marvelous,"I am thrilled with this mixer. I have never had one of such high quality. Mixing is a breeze. It's heavy so chose a color that you wouldn't mind on your countertop. I am enjoying the cobalt blue. I do wish that it came with more than one bowl. But beyond that, it is perfect."
2,Not as expected,The clamps are large. Using them would defeat the purpose of trying to make the wire less noticeable which is supposed to be the purpose of the flat cable.
2,Does not fit the cable well.,I bought these clamps for the corresponding SuperFlat Monster speaker cable but they do not really fit the cable as they are supposed to. I could manage to install it by bending the cable to make it fit into the clamps. Let me emphasize that this is the appropriate size as recommended by the manufacturer. The cable itself included a few samples of the same clamps that were as small as the ones purchased separately.
1,Wrong Size Clamp for Superflat Mini Cable!,"The Monster Clamps and Corner Trim, PN 104148-00, package supplied by Amazon, has the ""Flat (20 pcs)"" and ""Mini"" boxes checked. However the clamps are too narrow to fit the regular Monster Superflat Mini cable! The actual width of the cable is 0.560 inch (14.23 mm) the clamp space for the cable is only 0.504 inch (12.80 mm) wide. Not enough room to hold the cable flat. The clamps pinch the sides of the cable and ends up looking worse than no clip at all. To top this off even the clamps included with the 50 ft rolls of SuperFlat Mini cable are the same width and have been for a year or two. Monster needs to check this out and get the right parts in these two products."
4,Very well thought out,My daughters enjoyment of this made me go buy a second one!!! It helps them understand technology and allows them to be endlessly creative. I'd say it was great for any little one up to 6 or so. That being said it may be for older kids once you get the add-on cartridges. I haven't purched anything additional yet. YETBlessings
2,just not right,"This blanket just never seemed to heat up right. It would do OK when set on 5 or below, but if it was set at 6 or above, it shuts off"
1,"Horrible product, no quality control","For some reason the only electric blankets I can find anywhere are this Sunbeam variety. I have owned 4 of them now and they last an average of 2 months if they work at all. This recent one I bought flashes ""FF"" the minute you plug it in which is supposed to be some kind of malfunction- you are supposed to plug in and reset it to fix it but that doesn't work- this is the SECOND one of these that has done that. The other 2 I own had one that broke after 3 mos and another that still lights up but doensn't get very warm anymore after a year. No idea why these are the only electric blankets available but I will pay double the amt for a better product somewhere if I can find it."
1,Should be called disposable blankets,"Awful, awful product. They'll only last one winter season, if that long. Anybody who has given this product more than one star hasn't had to use it for a second season. The controller blinks when you plug it back in meaning it's broken. They ought to call these things ""disposable electric blankets"" because you have to throw them away and buy another one after a few months. Don't waste your money. I'm sorry I did!"
1,Terrible,I have gone through two of these blankets and they both lasted less than a year. They suck so bad. DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE
1,Lasted less than 6 months,"Same issue as everyone else, Blinking. I was able to resolve it once but unplugging it and reconnecting. It worked for a few more weeks then dead for good!!! Waste of Money."
1,Fails completely after a few months use.,"After a few months use the blanket stopped working correctly. When turned on the blanket seems to work for a few to several minutes, then the controller starts blinking and the blanket stops working. At this point the only way to turn off the blinking light is to unplug it."
3,Works fine BUT,"The blanket material, is of poor grade. I've always trusted Sunbeam, and the previous ones I have had, definatly had a better quality of base fabric."
1,Avoid useless does not last!! Avoid sunbeam products at all cost.,"Useless, barely gets warm on highest settings. Have own total of 5 and only 2 works... Sunbeam avoid they make cheap products and does not stand behind their warranty!"
2,Very nice in the 30 days it worked,"This could be a very good investment if it worked. Mine was a king size and had two separate controls, one for each side of the bed, and they can be turned on/off and adjusted independently. It had a Pre-Heat function that was wonderful, you just turn it on and press PH and went to wash your teeth, change, or whatever, and when you return to your bed in those cold nights, the bed was all warm and comfortable.But this thing just lasted about a month. Soon one of the controls began flashing ""FF"" and stop working. The other side was working fine for a while. That's when I began searching the Web for a solution, and found out that many, many customers have this same problem, and that, acording to them, Sunbeam has a terrible customer service department.Solution? I think is none, just stay away from it and you will be fine."
4,"Excellent text book - comprehensive, and easy to read","If you need to learn about the Mutual Fund Industry, this is the right book. It is a comprehensive treatment of the topic. However, it is not written densely - in fact, it is downright interesting. The information is layed out well, with good mapping techniques so that you always know where you are. You can find information later quickly because of this same feature. The tone is casual enough to not feel preachy or stilted, yet still conveys all the necessary information. My dyslexic husband is reading 1/2 chapter per night, and frequently reads more than that planned amount. He applies what he learns immediately at work, but I suspect that a reader would retain more than an average amount of information even without immediate application.Bottom line: Great reference, and really good learning textbook. Would be five stars if it had more pictures, or interactive exercises, but then, how many textbooks of this type do?"
2,Average Text Heavy Book,"Really expected this book to include a lot more process flows and diagrams to make it easy for readers to understand. However, it is chapter after chapter of text. I believe the authors had relied on some service providers to obtain the true understanding of the industry.However, having worked in the fund industry for 15 years, I can say that it is an average book. It can give you general understanding of the industry."
3,Not true to size,I bought these for my dad. Slipper is 2 sizes too small with the fur inside. Returning them and reordering. Hopefully they will fit the second time around.
2,Tamarac by slippers international,I should n=know by now not to purchase shoes or clothing online....I sent the first pair bad because they were too tight and this pair is too big.....I'm just going to give them away.....It's too big of a hassle sending things back.
3,Tight for size listed,These shoes were listed as 12EE. I have worn 12EEEE for a long time in all my other shoes. When I first received these shoes I could hardly get them on. Felt like 11D. I came very close to sending them back. My wife said maybe I should wear them around the house for a couple days. I did and they streatched to where they are comfortable but still somewhat tight.
2,Wore out in less than a year,I really liked these slippers when I first got them because they seemed sturdier than the ones from the Main store catalog. But I just noticed the sole is detaching from the upper after about 8 months.
5,The best slippers I have ever owned!,"Although somewhat pricey, these Tamarac Cody Sheepskin slippers are worth every penny. They are extremely comfortable and very durable. I highly recommend these if you enjoy wearing house slippers."
5,Very Nice Slipper,"I ordered these slippers for my husband for Christmas this year. He asked for one thing and that was a nice pair of indoor/outdoor slippers. When they arrived, I opened the box and was very pleased. My husband is pretty picky and he really, really likes them. He said they are made very well, they are very warm, and made to last. I would definitely recommend them!"
2,Didn't Last,"I bought these slippers in Nov 08, the insole wore thru at the ball of my foot by March 09. They were worm and cozy at first. It was a lot of money for a short life!"
1,Extremely disappointed with quality and longevity.,"I've had a pair of Old Friend Men's slippers as well as another pair of Tamaracs. Both lasted 1.5-2yrs. Figured another pair of Tamarac slippers was in order after my original pair was losing its shape (the inside still held up though!).Everyone rates these so highly, and in-fact my original pair follows the trend! However, the pair I just bought for over $50+ looks awful and worn after just over a month or so. I'm really bummed and disappointed at the same time. They either are cheapening their materials, or I got a pair in a absolutely awful batch. Sheet happens. Old Friend Men's here I come!"
2,"Underwhelmed - small, stiff and narrow","I bought these for my husband based on the good reviews here. He has a little bit of a wide foot, so I ordered a 10 wide, thinking he'd be able to wear them with or without socks. Well, when they arrived, my husband could barely get his foot into it. Once he did (without socks) his foot looked like a sausage in a casing inside the slipper! He said the bottoms weren't very well cushioned either, and the soles are not very flexible at all. We had to return them. I paid a bit more and ordered him some Uggs instead. Hopefully they'll be a better fit and quality..."
2,Pointy-toes cramp,"These Tamaracs seem well-made and comfortable--except that they are pointy-toed, so that there is no wiggle room, and toes are crammed together. I wear 13m shoes, and I ordered 14m. My old EMU slides were much more comfortable, but--according to several reviews--have deteriorated in quality. Hard to find a shearling slipper that has deep toe, and wide wiggle room. Why? Perhaps they can cut more shoes out of the material if they don't follow the natural contours of most feet?"
2,slippers run WAAAAY too small,"Previous reviewers were absolutely right. They run very small. I take a 8.5 W shoe size, and a 10 M (inexplicably, no 10 EE available) was TOO SMALL. The design also is tight over the top of the foot, making them a bad choice for anyone with a high instep. Otherwise, they look handsome and well-constructed.A word of warning: I ordered this item twice in an attempt to get a slipper that would fit. The second time, Amazon sent them from a place called ShoeMall.com. Do NOT order if they come from ShoeMall.com. You will have to pay for return shipping, and if the shoes don't fit that is hardly fair."
5,Best slipper that i have ever had.,"First off, my black lab ate my slippers, so i purchased a pair of Sorel slippers because these slippers where not available at the time.These slippers (Tamarac) were the most comfortable slippers that I have ever worn with great support on the bottom and warmth on cold nights.They are too hot for summer use.Order a size up if you are a half size.My new Sorel slippers are comfortable, but i liked the Tamarac Cody sheepskin twin gore better."
5,Awesome Comfortable Slippers,Slippers International Men's Cody Sheepskin Twin-GoreThese are the most comfortable slippers I have ever owned. I wear theminside and outside. Slip-on style with nice grip sole and very cushyinside sole for a very comfortable feel as you walk. Keeps you warm whencool and allows you to dash outside without changing. A Must Have.
2,Too Small,I am a size 10.5 or 11 and i ordered size 11 on these slippers and they are too tight! At least a 11.5 or 12 if you are a size 11 is my recommendations. Ended up giving them to my cousin who is a size 10. Remember these run small so get .5 or a full size bigger.
4,Super Comfy and Warm for two years or so,"So I liked these slippers enough to buy a second pair once my first pair got to the point that I really needed something else. Super happy to get a fresh warm pair without all the shearling matted down from overuse!The good:Very warm, especially at firstDecent priceNot too flashy looking (important for me)Rubber sole for intermittant/emergency outdoor excursionsThe bad:After two years of constant use (everyday from about the minute I get home to when I go to bed, and when I wake up to when I leave the house), they really needed to be replaced. So they won't last forever. But then nothing does.I wanted the root beer color, but it wasn't available. Oh well.All in all, great slipper at a good price=warm feet."
5,True to size and Cozy!,These slippers are true to there size. My fiance is a size 13 and I got a size 13 and fit perfectly with socks on. I got these for him as an early X-mas present since he wore out his last pair and he LOVES them! They are very cozy and sturdy. He wears them for short walks to the store as well as indoors. Since I have given him these slippers there is not a day that goes by when I don't see him in them. Great buy and great item! They are a little pricier than some slippers but with that comes quality and a more sturdy useful slipper.
3,Tamarc slippers not as good as the first pair I bought,"This is the second pair of identical slippers,I've purchased. The first pair appeared to be better made. The first pair is also heavier then the 2nd pair I bought. I'll be purchasing another brand next time."
2,"""so-so""","Nothing to write home about, the fit is poor and irregular size. Originaly ordered a pair and stitches were missing, but the fit was okay. Ordered a second replacement pair and they look okay, but the fit is sloppy. I have now spent a little over a month ordering, returning and so on, to buy one pair of slippers. I simply accept and will make do what they have sent me, and consider any further action with regard to these slippers as being just, ""more wasted time"". You can do better. shop arround."
5,Great Slipper!,"Well I don't normally write reviews but thought I would ""pay it forward"" as the reviews posted for this item helped me in my decision. These are awesome slippers! Best pair I've owned thus far! Very cozy inner lining. Nice durable sole. wear them everywhere! To the store, friends house, etc. First day I got them ended up unknowingly wearing them to the movies with my daughter. I had put them on and we left and did not realize til we got to the theater I was still wearing my new slippers. I wear them to check the mail and walk my dog around our (large) apartment complex. Even in the rain! I wear a 9 1/2 shoe size and took the recommendations of a few postings here and ordered a half size up (10). I am glad I did! They fit perfect with or without socks. I normally wear socks as my feet will sweat in these without them! Would definitely recommend these slippers! Cozy, Cozy, Cozy!!"
4,Good all around.,Good pair of slippers. Order a size bigger as most reviews state. Only issue is some of the fleece lining fell out(expected this due to the sheer amount). great if you want to wear indoors or outdoors. Very warm as well. No need for socks.
5,"Great, Cozy and Warm","Just got the Tamarac slippers a week ago and I have been wearing them at all opportunities. They are very warm without being hot, they fit perfectly and look great. They're also durable enough that I can run outside to the mailbox in the snow and ice without fearing that I'll ruin them.The soles are sturdy yet flexible. Climbing the stairs seems more comfortable while wearing them as they gain a lot of traction there.I normally wear 11.5 shoes but I ordered the size 11 slippers as I was worried the larger size would feel too loose. I was right and the size 11 slippers are snug, which I like, but they stay on my feet and I have no fear that they will slip off. Some pairs of slippers I've tried in the past seem to slide off at every opportunity.This purchase was well worth the money."
5,Great gift!,"I bought these for my stepfather for Christmas. The quality was excellent, and he really liked them!"
5,Fantastic,"I decided for the first time in my life to get a nice pair of slippers. I bought a pair of the ""like new"", and when they came to my doorstep they were in pristine condition. These slippers,so far, are the most comfortable and warm things I have ever put my feet in. I have even contemplated getting a second pair."
5,Best Slippers I Have Ever Had,I bought these last week. So far they are the best purchase I have made in a long time. The inside is warm and keeps your feet toasty. My feet sweat a little but only after a long period of use. I like to wear socks with them if my feet get too clammy.Highly recommended. I bought myself another pair.
5,Perfect for my Picky husband!,"Quality item. Everything the description said it would be. Nice color, warm, indoor/outdoor, stylish but not overly ornate for those picky guys, sturdy and cushy. Shipping was fast and the item was packed nicely. I highly recommend!"
3,Nice,They are OK. Not great but for the price they are very nice. I will be happy if they last longer than my last pair.
3,Great product with some Quality issues,The product seems very nice. The fleece lining was awsome. The only issue was that when the arrived the elastic on the sides appeared to have already begun to fail. It was something my Wife had already expressed some concern over so we returned them for a model that did not have elastic.
1,Disappointing,"I saw these guys at the 11 WMC and they rocked the house. Unfortunately, this album is disappointing, repetitive and very dated. The best way to describe it is that it has the feel of getting to a club way too early and listening to the ""background music""."
5,Greek Verb System: Seven-Color chart,I teach Greek in a private school and I have found this chart to be one of the best resources for the Greek Verb System. My students have no problem using this chart to learn the Greek Verb. I am constantly referring to it to help me stay on track! It is well worth purchasing. I hope it is reprinted.
5,A birdeye view of Greek verb conjugation system,"This is the one of kind chart for the koine Greek verb system. Although the font is small, the complete verb inflection system is on one sheet and well organized. The seven colors even add more usefulness to the chart. With different colors denoting an augment, connecting vowels, or endings, the conjugation pattern is clearly illustrated. A must for every Biblical Greek student."
5,Wonderfull,"Lost month I saw The Damnations play at SXSW'99 in Austin. Never heard of the band before. I fell for the music after the first minute I heard them play. After the concert I rushed to a local musicstore to buy Half Mad Moon. I can't tell how often I ever since have played this great record. The two sisters have wonderfull voices and they sound even as good as the female singers of Freakwater. The energy and passion of Rob Bernard makes it all complete. Listen to 'No sign of water"" and ""kansas"" and you know what I mean. For sure the cd will be one of my very favourites of this year, not to mention this century. He who ever tells you that The Gourds is the best band of Austin, don't believe him: The Damnations is. Buy this fantastic cd!!Philip Brouwer"
5,Infectiously captivating music,"This is the type of music that quickly finds its way under your skin and makes fine use of the ""repeat"" buttons on CD players. Seen live, this band pours high energy heart and soul into refreshingly new songs. The lyrics have delightful phrasing and enchanting harmonies that demand your ears. This studio recording captures all of that in a package to take with you."
1,waiting,Ordered this well before Christmas and still have not recieved it. It is now mid January. Any info on this?
4,A RARE BLEND!,"What if Amy were actually the Washington Squares, and Deb the Cowboy Junkies; what would they sound like? ANSWER: Damnation TX. These girls wail! And so do with emotion and humor. Some pretty good stuff here."
5,Just keep listening to it.,"i stopped listening to recently released music because i don't fit the description. i kept playing my music. now i want to find a way to share old-time music with people. it can be contemporary. we're living proof...it should be fun, but it should be real. a good friend of mine plays on this record. we should all have that connection to music (the studio cuts sound good, too)."
4,"Interesting, Informative, Captures the attention of reader","I'm a teenager and very interested in the Russian Revolution, but mainly the Imperial Family and their lives during the Revolution. This book, even though titled after Alexandra, also touches the subjects of other royals, and the war. I really, really enjoyed it and I recommend it to anyone who is curious about the Imperial Family of Russia."
3,The best secondary source for Alix's early years,"This book's greatest strength lies in its divulgence of Alexandra's early life. While the bulk of the book focuses on the tsarina's times and the people in her life, this work is the best book in print focusing on Alexandra alone. I feel Mr. King is overly sympathetic to his subject at times, but this bias can be overcome if the reader remains aware of the bias while studying the book. My biggest regret is that Mr. King, in my opinion, has damaged his reputation as a ""serious"" historian with his recent turn toward writing ""celebrity biographies."" Nevertheless, I recommend this work."
1,A big disappointment,"The author starts out by talking about how much new ground he has broken by writing this book. By saying that, he set a standard that the book simply does not reach. It's more a history of her times, rather than her life. I agree with the other one-star reviewer who said that there's not really any new information offered in ""The Last Empress."""
1,Excellent insight into one of Russias most elusive royals,"Finding this book was a very exciting moment for me. For years, I have been fascinated with the Last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia. Most of the books that I have found thus far, have delved into the family as a whole without giving true insight into each member as an individual. What I have found missing from all of the books that I have read on the Last of the Russian Royals is a picture of them from birth to death and the early events that shaped them. Reading Mr. King's novel allowed me to understand Alexandra not just as the Last Tsarina but also as a young girl and the Grand-Daughter of Queen Victoria. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who wants to learn about Alexandra as an individual and not just as Russias' Last Empress."
4,A great keyboard for our older machines,"When my older eMachine keyboard broke down after many years of faithful service, I looked around for a windows 98 compatible keyboard as a replacement. I know this is sort of ""prehistoric"" hardware but my selection of this keyboard turned out to be excellent. Was very satisfied."
2,Pretty pointless.,"""Illustrated Anthologies of Great Writers: Virginia Woolf"" was a letdown. I was expecting information about Virginia Woolf, along with what was offered in this little book (diary and letter snippets, and excerpts from her novels), but I was left wanting more. I do not see the point in this book. I do not recommend."
4,Good Cleats,true to size and great and real good for latteral movement if your a skilled position your going to want lighter cleats. O Linne D Line Linebacker fullback perfect cleats for those positions.
5,Worth the coin,"The size fits perfectly. I needed shoes like this to play as OL and so far my feet feel comfortable. I have no difficulties with side steps or running. I highly recommend this shoes, at least for OL and DL."
4,A lot of answers,"This book takes an approach that is not so scholarly that it is intimidating but offers enough research and knowledge in the subject that the reader finds the thesis of the work understandable,logical,and believable. This book approaches religion pretty much how he approaches religion and God in his other works."
2,If Christ Were Not Arisen,"This is better than most of Spong's works, if only because it makes more of an effort to grapple with the biblical texts. However, it once again misrepresents his opposition as much more unsophisticated than is the case. If Spong is to invoke Tillich, than his Tillich should be set upon Karl Barth, rather than Jerry Falwell. More to the point, the book never gets around to providing a real answer to the obvious question of ""If no bodily Jesus, then what?"" The obvious answers, a living body or nothing, are forbidden from the outset, so the exercise is in the end unsatisfying."
1,"A great ""bok"" indeed","The previous reviewer, if German, is quite right in calling it a great bok. ""Bok"" is phonentic German for ""goat"" and that just about sums it up."
1,Faith in Vain,"I don't want my money back, I really don't. I was just wondering if someone would refund me the life I spent reading this book? I may be an ignorant savage, but I do know without a resurrection, there is no Christanity and there is definatly no reason for me to believe in its validity. I might as well go back to Judaism if Sprong is right. So please, will someone give me back the life I just spent on this drivel? Please??"
2,A False Dilemma,"There is another explanation that is more plausible than either literalism OR Spong's implausible interpretation. It normally took days to die of crucifixtion. Jesus was up there only for a few hours. Then his tomb was found empty, and later he shows up at his friends' hideout. They all agree that he was solid, fleshly, and wounded, with nail holes in his hands. He begs them to give him something to eat (!), and then leaves, intending to rendevous with them again soon. Isn't it far more plausible to suppose he managed somehow to survive the cricifixtion, than that he was magically, supernaturally raised from the dead? Hello? People have been known to survive wounds far worse, including multiple stab wounds and bullets. Notice his friend, Joseph, is the one who took away the ""corpse."" Notice also the friend who gave him some substance to drink up there, after which he swoons. Think..."
2,An arrogant attack on traditional Christianity.,"John Shelby Spong would be an engaging, thought-provoking scholar if he were not so full of himself. While his argument for a metaphorical reading of the New Testament resurrection accounts bears some weight, his condescending treatment of people who believe the stories report literal history blunts his case.Spong thinks so highly of himself that he assumes if he can't take the accounts literally, then no intelligent person could. Those Christians who do -- which includes not just Fundamentalists, but also evangelicals and most mainline Protestants -- will read this book with the clear impression that Bishop Spong think them frankly stupid.It's not an effective way to win converts to one's view"
2,A disappointment,"As a person who grew up in a very strict fundamentalist pentecostal church and have serious questions about fundamentalism I have enjoyed reading Spong's other books especially ""Living in Sin?"" and ""Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism"". I don't agree with everything Spong says in these books but at least they have given me a different perspective. However, I found this book to be weak in argument and poorly written. What I don't understand about Spong's argument against the resurrection is he thinks its physically impossible for Christ to rise from the dead. If God is God then why should s/he be confined by natural laws. A God who has to conform to the laws of the natural universe is not truly God. This book has made me realise that Spong is not a Christian as he claims but a humanist, or worse, a Christian who has lost faith in God."
5,Great Toy,"I shoot with a DSLR 99.9% of the time, but this just for fun. its very light plastic seems cheap but what do u expect for a 35mm camera under $100. Ive already had photos printed and they came out great. i recommended getting ISO 400 and shooting with the flash all the time unless direct sunlight is involved. im really happy with this!"
4,Seeing through a fisheye,"This camera is just fun. I loved it so much I bought another one for a friend. Great fun, round images. Best if only used outdoors."
4,Great purchase,"I have had some excellent results with this camera and I have just begun to play around with it. I have gotten the best results when I shoot in outdoor, sunny conditions, or in still environments where I can use the bulb setting. When shooting close subjects, be warned that the range finder is way off. Use it to get an idea of what the shot will look like, but don't look through it to aim the shot. Just hold the lens in front of your subject from the angle you want."
4,Fun and different camera,"I really enjoy shooting with this camera. It is easy to use and takes great pictures, just make sure you get really close to your subject. The only problem I have is that it is plastic and after about a month the rewind crank broke off. I called the company and they exchanged it no charge. I am being very careful with my new one. I definitely recommend it."
2,"Fun camera, but very cheaply made","After one day out of the package, and no photos taken yet, the multiple/single exposure tab or switch on the back was broken. It was loose and did not lock in either direction. Had great fun with the camera for one roll, however, when I went to put in the next new roll of film the advance wheel turned but would not turn on the inside to catch the film. Unable to load film = sent it back to Amazon! This camera has a lot of potential. The pictures turned out great for the most part, very creative and unique. Would suggest making it in AMERICA instead of China, the quality shows for it. This cheapness would have been fine for $20, but not $60."
2,Not what it advertises,"I ordered the fisheye 2 and though it arrived fast and on time, the description said nothing about the flash not working. I tried changing the batteries, everything, and it still would not turn on or work properly.I went to develop my first roll ,and all the film came out BLACK. I regret buying this camera, wasting my money and I do not plan on buying from these sellers again."
4,It's what it is.,"The camera is okay. I recommend you to take the picture in a bright environment (sunny weather). If you need to take picture outside in the late afternoon, for shutter speed you'd better choose B instead of N, even when you are using high ISO film. Otherwise, the noise of the picture will drive you crazy.NOTE: if you own a DSLR camera body, just buy a fisheye lens. It costs you almost the same, but it will give you nicer and better quality pictures with similar effect. However, if you are familiar using the film camera, you can create an antique feeling of the picture which DLSR can't give you.Overall, this is a fun camera. However, if you can only tolerate the photo quality produced by a DSLR camera, you shouldn't buy this one."
2,Good fun if you don't mind losing shots,"I was given the Lomo Fisheye 2 for Christmas. It's a fun little camera, but it's pretty junky. Of course it's junky; it's a Lomo.However, I lost so many shots trying to rewind the film when the roll was done. It would come unspooled, so the only way to avoid exposing the film was to either go into my bathroom, shove a towel under the door, turn off the lights, & open the camera, or borrow my dad's black bag. I still had to take the film out and then hand spool it back into the film canister. Frankly, that annoyed me so much that I haven't really played with it since I first discovered this little ""quirk""If you want a fish-eye look to your pictures, you're better off getting a camera that you can swap out the lenses with. The fish eye isn't even that exaggerated. Most of the pictures just look like they have a circle frame around them."
2,Disappointed,Bruins Ultra DecalEmblem is what I thought it would be but it is constantly peeling away from the wall which was cleaned and allowed to dry for 24 plus hours. Only way to keep it on display is with scotch tape.Truly disappointed
2,Fell off in the first 72 hours,"It was a great sticker while it lasted! However, I suppose I was wrong in my assumption that this decal was suitable for a MOVING car, as it fell off within a few days. (Interesting note: I was not on any high-speed freeway. It was during my 15min daily drive to work, with a max limit of 45mph.)This product would be immensely improved if the adhesive were on the front of the decal, instead of the back. Of course this would allow the sticker to be placed inside the windshield, therefore preventing the tragic loss of future B's."
5,Great Sound Pool Collection,"This is a great collection of audio clips for your home videos (use a sound mixer software to add flare with this collection). Since it is royalty free, you can use it for backgrounds for those home movies and share with friends and family."
1,Sending out a new order,I received my Printshop 20 and the CD's did not read. I emailed the company that sent it to me and they are sending out another order to me as soon as possible. Check back in a few weeks and I would love to rewrite my review. I was very happy that they offered to send out another order and I did not have to send the defective one back and pay for shipping. That was very considerate of the company.
4,"Mediocre writing, excellent story","Reading this book, I was struck by the originality of the plotline and the richness of imagination that obviously went into this book. Having said that, however, I must also remark on the book's shortcomings: The writing seems rather halted and filled with run-ons. While I enjoyed the book, the poor sentence structure and word choice were something of an annoyance, as they obstructed the book's clarity."
5,A Jewel Worth Waiting For,"I am so excited this book is finally on your shelves! I've waited since 2002 for JJ's next book, since The Secret Treasures of Oak Island"" was published.The fact that Mr. Pritchard has personally traveled to this part of the world, makes this new thriller even more enchanting!Keep 'em coming, JJ! My shelves wouldn't be the same without your treasures! Terry Ann, Seattle"
1,Chapter Seven has 23 Errors,"Chapter Seven, ""Wooden Wonders"" of the ""Winged Eight,"" an impressive title, but not its contents. This chapter contains 23 errors on the USAAF 25th BG Rcn. All researchers are forewarned to check official USAAF files and records for verification before quoting any information from this chapter."
2,Get me a can of insect repellant.,"As an avid WW2 aviation history reader, I was very disappointed with the book. Rather than an actual in-depth treatment of the subject, it was simply a collection of mostly unconnected vignettes and seemed, at best, to make what should have been an interesting read...boring.MEN WHO FLEW THE MOSQUITO: Compelling accounts of the 'Wooden Wonders' triumphant WW2 Career"
2,not the best,"The texture of this lip balm is really chunky and has a sticky sensation. It does not apply smooth, maybe I just got a dud?"
2,inaccurate description,"The product I received is Weleda Everon, but it is NOT not the product described here, because THE INGREDIENTS ARE DIFFERENT. If I had wanted the one that was sent, i would have just gone to the stupid store and bought it, not paid $$$ more to have it shipped across the country. How stupid.I want the old Weleda Everon! >:("
5,Impressive,"For the price, these have to be the greatest headphones that I've ever owned. Compared to similarly priced headphones, the sound is verfy clear because of the over-ear padding. My only complaint is that the pads wear more quickly than I would've liked, but if that is the one downfall of these, then their quality obviously speeks for themselves."
1,More #'s than a trader needs.,"This book might be relevant to a mathemetician, but to a trader it gets a lot more complicated than necessary. Most successful traders that I know believe in ""Keep it Simple""."
2,Primitive & limited,"I do not recommend this product. I purchased it and On Hand Software's Texas Hold'em. I like On Hand much better because it provides a variety of game structures, e.g., no limit & limit, cash & tournament. There is also more flexibility in the ability to customize speed."
3,paint is no good,"This box is SO cute. The tiles are also nice, but the paint is terrible! The paint did not go on well at all. We ended up going to the craft store to buy paint for the tiles, which was not cheap. Cute idea, bad paint."
4,An almost comprehensive how-to manual for the neophyte,"At the recommendation of a teaching assistant in one of my classes at Dartmouth College,I purchased this book. I was really surprised about how little I knew about the application process to graduate school. If you have a friend or relative who is applying to graduate school in psychology (the toughest programs to get into, esp. clinical), you need this book to minimize the number of rejection letters you will receive in April. One note though: The authors need to include material on how to do a thesis."
3,"Decent quality, rather small ,and pricey","I bought this for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. I didn't pay that much attention to the size, and I must admit I was a little disappointed that it was so small (about 7 inches on a side). On the plus side, the quality of the box seems fine. Overall, I think it's a bit overpriced. If you can find a good deal on it somewhere (say $30), then you'll probably be happy about your purchase. Otherwise, you may want to look at your local Macy's or JC Penneys and see if you can find something on sale that is a little larger.Written by Arthur Bradley, author of ""Process of Elimination"" - a cool erotic thriller that pits a martial artist against a world-class sniper.As always, please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful."
2,Functional but outdated,"The primary purpose of this cable is to allow the user to connect two computers via serial port for file (and sometimes printer) sharing. While this still works, only DOS 6.22 and Windows 9x support it (under INTERLNK or ""Direct Cable Connection""), it's very slow, and it's a whole lot of trouble. I recommend purchasing a low-cost Ethernet or phone-line networking product instead--both are much faster, easier to set up, and will work with (and between) many operating systems.Overall recommendation: purchase this cable only if you *must* fileshare with an MS-DOS based system and cannot install a network card."
1,never buy again,The tape is a very poor recording. My son lost interest because it was continually interrupted by static.
3,Just okay,"I am a certified P-12 art educator. I got this book because for the first time ever I was going to be teaching preschoolers. To me, most the ideas were.....more complex than my 3-4 year olds could handle, a little bit old school and too crafty. I whole heartedly believe in process art instead of product art (crafts), I just haven't found this book to be all I was hoping for to aid me with my class.That being said, if you are a preschool teacher, or someone not ""trained"" in art, I do think this book would be helpful to you. Additionally, this book would be a good resource for a homeschool mom, or a mom wishing to do more indepth things than coloring with young children. There are several things that require hot water, or melted crayons. These are things I would do with my own kids, but not so much with my class of 16.So, depending on your needs, this book may or may not be for you."
3,A good book for ideas,I purchase this book for my ECHS-art class textbook. This book offers great ideas for anyone seek to do creative art work with children 3 and up.
2,Reader from California,"This book is great for a beginner. However, if you are a teacher or an artist - it is old stuff. Things like crayon rubbings, fingerprint art, junk sculpture etc."
3,"Not earth-shattering, but solid","Yes, this book has many art ideas suitable for littles. Many, however, are pretty simple and obvious, so there isn't as much really helpful information as you'd think. Lots of them are the same as what you'd find in any other craft book geared to this age. That's ok, because you might not have all the other craft books, but it's something to keep in mind. Since I already have a fairly extensive collection of craft books, I didn't find a lot of new ideas in this one."
5,"Excellent, Easy, Fun Projects","I love all of MaryAnn Kohl's books, this being no exception. If you are looking for a book for a preschooler to paint like VanGogh, then this is not the book. If you want a book that has great, fun, easy ideas using common materials, this book is excellent. I noticed the few bad reviews and feel those individuals really do not understand preschool children and how their minds are. Sure, some of the ideas are very simplistic, but for children, the PROCESS of creating is what is important. They may ""see"" things in their project that adults don't. The foil sculpture--why not? It is fun. My kids loved it, I loved it. Remember, art is in the eye of the beholder.My children have done many of these projects and are very pleased and proud of their work. The projects increase their creative abilities and allow their imaginations to run wild. And as a mom, I enjoy them just as much."
5,no more cookie-cutter projects!!,This book is a great resource for those who work with children and those who train those who work with children! It is refreshing to see a focus on the process and how important art is for children. The formt of each project is very easy to use and understand.
3,Great for basic art. Average for others,"I thought this book was great for those who are looking for the very basics of pre-school art. For example, coloring, scribbling,and painting. However, those of you who have even minor art backgrounds, or are crafty yourselves, may want to pass this one up. I found a 7 out of the advertised ""200"" ideas to be new, and inovative. For those I am grateful, but I was looking for more. I found a great deal of repetition in this book. The author uses many different ways to make paint, weave thread through holes in cardboard etc...as a new idea in each chapter."
5,A definate book for hockey lovers!,"This is a great book for people who want to understand the game. It answers questions from the exact length of the ice, lines on the ice, etc. to the different hand motions on the penalties called by the referee. I give this one 5 stars!!!"
5,As good as TV gets.,"Very few shows have left a legacy behind them as the Twilight Zone. It was the second series, in my opinion, when the show really came into its own. Many classic episodes are included here- and watching them again was like visiting with old friends...And if anything they seem even better with the passing of years."
4,"Solid story telling, to be sure","The presentation of the second season sees the series begin to mature and feel more confident in the style of stories and execution to present.So much has been said about this series, I can hardly add anything new. I saw these in ""first run"" as a kid and I still love them, though I really have to be in the right frame of mind to watch them."
1,free at your local library,"I love Twilight Zone, but why pay for it when you can get all years on DVD for free at your local library?"
4,twilight,"One of my favorites, now I get a chance to enjoy it again commercial free. It is excellent series. I hope to enjoy the whole series."
4,Videotaped Episodes,"The Twilight Zone was picking up speed by Season 2. By this time, CBS began to see that it was a great show, which all of us knew since the beginning.The only problem that plagued Season 2 were the six episodes that were videotaped instead of filmed due to budget reasons. These episodes were ""The Lateness of the Hour,"" ""Static,"" ""The Whole Truth,"" ""Night of the Meek,"" ""Twenty-Two,"" and ""Long Distance Call"" (you can actually view the difference when compared to the remaining episodes).With this Definitive Edition, it is obvious that the videotaped episodes haven't held up well visually and audibly. Many of the scenes from these episodes either jump or fluctuate. The audio is also hard to hear when characters are away from the camera, thus, away from the microphone.However, don't let these episodes sway the fact that The Twilight Zone was a great show and even with these few episodes, Season 2 is a great addition."
2,Season 2 Cannot be in HD,"Starting with episode 8 ""The Lateness of the Hour"", several episodes of Season 2 were originally captured on videocassette instead of actual film. Where film can be re-sampled in higher resolution for Blu-ray, videocassette cannot. Viewers may also notice that these episodes were shot at 30 frames per second. This is different enough from the 24 frames per second that you are used to that you will notice, and undoubtedly dislike, the change. I know that many will buy this season on blu-ray to have a complete set, but know that half of this season will be visually disappointing."
2,Setbacks,"Hi Definition does have its setbacks. These episodes weren't meant to be seen with such clarity, as now you can spot the seam in the background cylcorama at 18:21 in ""The Grave"", or the fact that in ""Eye of the Beholder"" the nurse walking into the room at the very beginning is not wearing any 'ugly' makeup, among many other ""flaws"" which were not noticeable before the advent of Blu-Ray or Hi Res screens... AND we're still expected to pay such a high price for it."
5,One of the Best episodes I've seen so far,"I love the Twilight Zone and usually I generally like what episodes I see on TV and this one was free and I thought ""hey! why not?"" and bought it. It was everything I hope to find in a TZ eppy. The unusual, then the surprise! And it was a surprise. They did well on this one in my opinion."
1,Reprint of a book of earlies 1900's,"This book is more of historycal value than for practical purposes. I was trying to find information on how to build a public aquarium with the current technologies, therefore this book totally failed to my expectations."
1,Misleading info provided by Amazon,"You misled me into buying this book by stating it was written in 2004. I know you will state we should read the fine print but that info was totally misleading. This book was written in the 1920's, how relevant will it be in light of technologies for today.You say that if we want we can return it for a refund. However I had it forwarded to me here in Trinidad and Tobago and the cost having it returned will be more than the refund itself.I have bought a lot of books and other item in the past from Amazon and I am reviewing my relationship with you after this debacle.The only way this could be corrected is to give me a credit for the refund. Also please advise future customers of the actual date it was written."
2,Interesting for the first 3-4 months,"I ordered this guitar in March.It came just as described, pretty nice deal. I replaced the strings one month later, as they started to sound weird (and I wanted to experience some brand new strings).As a beginner, I enjoyed strumming on this guitar. But the sound was not perfect. I realised that only after I tried a different guitar. Even if I was doing my best (and my friend confirmed that for me) the frets were not good.No way to finger pick on this baby.So I am giving it a 2 stars. Only because I did enjoy it in the firs 2 months, is not a good reason to consider it a good guitar. After a beginner starts to apply some tricks beside the regular strumming, you realise it is not a guitar you enjoy playing."
2,More of a pain than its worth,"So I got this as a Christmas gift for my best friend and it came. I opened it up. Very cool, light weight, cool design.....cheap paint. The strap is pink and yellow. And the 2nd 3rd, and 4th frets needed to be filed down. I put a lot of work on it in order to make Christmas awesome. And by the way, the neck of the guitar near the inlays is pretty chopped up. Get this guitar if you plan on fixing it up."
1,"Wow, this sucks.","Well I got this because it was my first guitar. I have to tell you straight up that this sucks. First of all the strings were way to crappy. Like made out of plastic, and they were way to hard to tune. If you tune this it comes out of tune in no time. The case rips very easy and the strap breaks easy as well. The pick's are very bad, they are way to big. The extra strings are no better then the ones of there. I have bought another guitar from Guitar Center and it was amazing. Worked perfectly and it was cheap too. If you want my advice, save up and buy a good one from Guitar Center, because this is crap."
1,this guitar sucks,The guitar did not come with all the things it said it would. The condition when it arrived was good. However this guitar is just a really really bad quality guitar and it keeps going out of tune. Its a classical guitar but it came with steel strings instead of nylon and so it just would not make a very soothing sound. Even for beginner i would recommend investing in something better. Maybe rent a guitar if you are not sure you will stick with it. Renting is still cheaper than wasting $50 on this guitar. 2 weeks after i purchased this guitar i ended up buying a yamaha spx 500.
2,"Austin Bazaar 38""",The Guitar had a lot of nicks on it and the stickers that come on it look like they where just thrown on. Not what I buy again and I already sold it.
1,piece of crap,"I got this as a beginner guitar because the other one we got was too big. This guitar is poorly painted, the strings are weird..(and only came with one extra string)and the sound is horrible. I have had to tune it multiple times as well...in one sitting! You get what you pay for I suppose."
4,A bit pricey...,"This slim, good body was pretty good but... well you can find a slim, good body for much, much cheaper on quite a few street corners. So be sure and shop around folks!"
2,Too much reliance on FBI files.,"This book was thoroughly researched, evidently in an attempt to confirm the FBI version of the hunt for Charles Arthur Floyd. While the author uses multiple sources, including many from Oklahoma lawmen, when the story reaches the critical time of the Kansas City massacre and afterward, he relies almost solely on information provided by the FBI, which is completely unreliable. Most eyewitnesses did not place Floyd or Richetti at Union Station at the time of the killings. The federal prosecutor refused to try Richetti in Federal Court because of lack of evidence. He was then tried in state court, found guilty, and executed. Pretty Boy Floyd died from two .45 caliber gunshot wounds to the chest. How does an individual fleeing law enforcement officers get shot in the chest? The more one thinks about this incident, the more questions arise. It is a shame that the truth will never really be known about what happened at Union Station or about how Charley Floyd actually died."
3,Reminiscent of the Beverly Hillbillies,"Perhaps I'm nitpicking here. While all the facts are presented quite clearly and this is for the most part probably one of the better biographies of this desperado on the market, I had a problem with the writing, which at times was a bit too folksy for my taste. Words like ""kin,"" ""pappy,"" and ""smack-dab"" abound in these pages, as well as phrases such as ""dark as the inside of a wolf's mouth"" and ""clear as a newborn baby's piss,"" to mention a few. These aren't direct quotes, mind you, but Mr. Wallis' own characterizations. If you can get beyond this, you'll probably enjoy this book."
3,"A little crud, dude...","I liked the motorcycles, but the overall tone was a bit ""young"" for my taste; some initiation scenes and beery fratboy style humor that I could have lived without, alongside a few really enjoyable scenes of regular older guys showing and talking about their custom bikes. Sort of ""Animal House meets Choppertown"" One thumb up (in all fairness, their advertising was pretty clear, you know what you're buying if you order this film.)"
5,holy moly,"killer video man!!!! if you aren't familiar with these videos , do yourself a favor and buy all three..."
4,"a great bargain, but a few disappointments","As other reviewers have noted, this package comes cheaper than some of its individual items.However, just to prevent any disappointment:1. The original liner notes are not included. Landowska's LP recording of the Well-Tempered Clavier came with a thorough analysis by Landowka. As I recall, the analysis marked every section of every fugue. An official in the Ravinia Festival informs me that this analysis is available in a book entitled ""Landowska on Music"" (0812812336). Thank you, Ravinia Festival!2. The complete Three-Part Symphonies are not included--only 1-2, 5, 11, and 13-15.I am not the world's number one Landowka fan. She sometimes takes some shocking liberties. At times, she applies a tempo rubato which is normally reserved for Chopin. She is a fine one to say, ""You play Bach your way and I'll play it his."""
3,Brazen,"A review mentioned the word steroidal; I should have paid more attention. The harpsichord has languished in the shade of its younger brother, the piano (or pianoforte, softloud to give it its full name), because the harpsichord for all its tinkly charm cannot vary its volume and is rather soft. This piano envy goes back some 150 years. I bought this because I find the harpsichord charming and WL is one of The interpreters of Bach. So WL can plays these pieces on the original authentic instrument, but with a new LOUD variant of it. This harpsichord is still tinkly and at one volume, but NOW IT IS LOUD ALL THE TIME. Give me Gould and the piano, especially the 3 CD set of the GV done both when he was a young man and just before his death. Modulation is goodness."
2,Actually it is not about the witchcraft but the prersecution of suspected witches,"I was really hoping to gain some insight into the wicca people throughout history, but this book says nothing about them, and simply rattles off the various trials, hangings etc. Pretty dull stuff."
1,wow,it sucked it was on the against witchcraft side of the point and all-in-all i didn't like it i don't think it was at all true full just hateful i stopped after 10 pages because the way it made me feel
1,BE CAREFUL ! ! ZE5620US is not the computer described here.,"I Bought a ZE5620US on February, and after have a lot of problems with the technical data available on site, i received a notebook with only 256mb of RAM, and Amazon's said : ""Sorry, but your sole remedy is return the product and get your cash back""The described notebook is in fact ZX5040US..Amazon is able to delete my review, every day, but is unable to correct the technical data . . .And now, i have a Celeron with just 256Mb of RAM . .The notebook performance is terrible with so little memory . .I will have to expend more 60 dollars to buy the missing module."
3,Somewhere inbetween,"While the story was well written the characters themselves seemed rather limited. I had to keep reminding myself that this story takes place sometime in the early part of season 1 from the show's perspective. All in all I didn't really like the story, but I didn't dislike it either. An ok purchase if you're looking for something Stargate/Stargate Atlantis to read for an evening or two."
2,"A great book idea, but not a great telling of the story","I am a big fan of Stargate Atlantis and download a lot of the books from Amazon. I liked the summary of this one and thought it sounded good. It was not. In the first half of the book the bickering betwen team members just became boring to read. I know some of this was normal on the show and in other books, but the author overdid it. In the second half when Major Shepard grew claws--that was just to much for me to accept. I always want to find something positive to say--it was good having more of the characters that I really like. The price is too high for this book in a Kindle format. I will not read another by this author. Even at $2.99 which would be a more appropriate price."
5,Great music,It is one of the best CDs I have ever listen to! It is a must to have it in your collection if you are an admirer of such kind of music!
5,Nina Ramsby,"Nina Ramsby (the singer for Baxter) was also the singer for Salt. Salt made one album ""Auscultate"". Both albums are very good."
4,Worthy expansion to those who mourn Bristol,"Baxter's music evokes an ethereal, though grounded, and ultimately paranoid quality, not unlike a Belgian traveler lost in the altstadt during a downpour.While not my favorite outgrowth of the trip-hop movement, Baxter is a worthy listen. Trouble is, there's no radio hits, no easy snippets, which means this solidly put-together album never crossed most American ears, which is a shame. If it's on the radio, it doesn't mean it's any good. I knicked one star mostly because I'm spoiled rotten on Massive Attack's involving and enveloping rhythm and gloat - Baxter, while a great listen, has not yet brought about that kind of all-encompassing feel."
4,Artful and satisfying influences and juxtapositions.,"If you have to compare, a sort of American Portishead, with breakbeat influences rather than acid jazz. It's uniqueness is in the juxtaposition of the vocalists unmasked voice against the rich electronic composition and clever lyrics. Melancholy, but in no way depressing. :)"
2,It Could Have Been Sooooo Much Better.,"At the height of drum-and-bass's popularity, the electronic outfit Baxter releases its self-titled debut in 1998. The first two tracks, ""Television"" and ""Fading"" effectively provide chilly landscapes of hyperactive drum beats, eerie synths, and an overall dark and etheral environment I haven't experienced since Portishead's debut. But, boy, is it a steep dive from there. Tracks get repetitve when there should be variety. The record gets boring when it tries to be mellow. And the lyrics, sung in a spoken-girl voice by lead singer Nina Rambsy, are simplistic and embarrassingly plain. ""Baxter"" gets the mood and feeling right when it wants to, but it's way too uneven for me to recommend."
2,Not what I thought it was,I had high hopes after all the good reviews. I was disappointed with this cd. I've only listened to it once. It reminds me of underground club music of the early 90's.
4,Baxter Roxors,"Ordinarily, I don't care much for vocal drum and bass or jungle, largely because I felt that many artists did not fit the vocals to the music well, but simply layered them on. Baxter is an excellent exception in that regard. The voice of Nina Ramsby blends wonderfully with the darkly energetic music.Overall, I wanted to give this 4.5 stars. I reserve the perfect rating of 5 for an album that I will play all of the way through whenever I play it, whereas this has a couple of songs I didn't much care for and tend to skip. I definately recommend this album to anyone that likes vocal D&B;, jungle, or darker trance(s)."
4,Sometimes the library throws me a surprise...,"Flipping through the CD's at the library, I came across this one and I thought that the cover picture was so terribly ugly that I just had to try it. Wow. I was impressed. The music is so very hip and Euro sounding. When my friend from London visited me I put this CD on and the next store had us shopping... so he could buy a copy for himself. It's a CD that does well on both sides of the world... a definite must-have if you're into the European club sound. (Though this CD is mellower than the club-techno sound.)"
3,"Predictable, But Pretty Good",This book is about a boy who wants to be a detective and rides the elavator to find cases. One day a duck is on the elavator and he finds out who the owner is. This book is good but is predictable. I would reccomend this book to people who like to read mysteries and solve them!
1,Not Even Remotely Necessary,"Monster Cable makes a lot of great cables. I think they are most known for their stereo cabling which is of much higher gauge than generic speaker cables, and they have great cables for the RCA in and out jacks as well. These are all ANALOG signals, and the extra quality can (and does) make a huge difference.On a digital connection, ambient interference is automatically filtered out. I don't own this item, but had to say I did in order to write a review. Cheap IEEE1394 cables are just as good. If you want to line the pockets of Monster Cable, replace that junky speaker cable you bought at Radio Shack!"
2,Pay $10 for the same product!,Do not be fool by marketing and pay 4x more for the same result. Monster Cables are great for all ANALOG signals. You do not need gold connectors for DIGITAL data. A $10 cable will do exactly the same. Do not worry about noise on a 6-foot wire unless you are planning to loop this on a high voltage power wire. Technology is moving away from Monster Cable.
5,Very good book!,This is how Thomas Gallaudet and Laurent Clerc settled the first deaf education in America.
1,Teaching Toward...Freedom?,"I had to read this book for one of my teaching classes, and out of all the awful books my instructor assigned during the semester, this one was the worst.First of all, Mr. Ayers includes so many poems in it that he may as well have just compiled an anthology. Most of them are not even good poems. They are the likes of that which you might see a 10 year old write. I don't know why he bothered to write a book when he contributed less than half of it. But if you like crap ""poetry,"" then you might enjoy this book.Secondly, Mr. Ayers doesn't seem familiarised with the precepts of economics. He says that all children are entitled to a free and high quality education, all while dissing private schools. However, he fails to understand that you can have free OR high quality, but not both. This is because he hasn't yet asked himself who will provide this free and high quality education, nor has he considered what it means to deserve something.[...]"
4,Really Great MiniDV with mem card for Ok pics,"Sony TRV22 is a great little minidv. I prefer taking pictures with an Olympus 35m camera, but I wanted to move into digital for video, and figured it would be silly to not pick up memory card technology for digital pictures, in one device. The TRV22 has everything you need in a palm size package with amazing features. But not stuff you'll never use. These are cool features that really beef up your otherwise simple (or hoohum)home video. The only complaint is the sound is very low, even with the volume turned all the way up, and the digital pictures are sub mega pixle (so stick with a 35m right?). But the touch screen is a blast! Don't buy the trv19. Spend 20% more and get real fun. Also you can film in complete darkness with the IR light. Its like those Special Forces night films you see on TV. Dude!"
3,Annoying motor noise,"Based on good reviews, I bought this Sony trv22. It's making a very annoying motor noise. I could clearly hear the noise on the recording. The picture quality is a little bit better than my old Hi8 camcorder. But I couldn't stand on that noise from the motor. I took out the tape from Sony, and tried on Panasonic camcorder at the retail store. It has much less noise. But the image stabilization is much better on Sony. I thought mine was defect, but after I tried on my friend's Sony PC105 which makes similar noise, I realized it is normal for Sony. I returned mine back."
5,Great for shooting indoors,"Strengths: Great low light performance, good image quality, low price, touchscreen LCD. I love this camera. My two biggest criteria were low light performance and size. I think the TRV22 is a good compromise between the two. The low light performance is great, much better than the Canon's and better than the new smaller vertical Sony cameras. There is a very slight motor noise picked up by the microphone but it's not that noticable. It does pick up wind noise really bad but I think all camcorders do. Overall a great buy, if you want to shoot indoors this is one of the best. I wasn't sure if I'd like the touchscreen LCD but it is simply awesome. No more fooling around looking for buttons on the side, you can easily access everything from the menu while filming!"
1,It's a Time-Bomb,"Mine lasted 2-1/2 years. Then suddenly one day the screen went black while recording. Then it would work for a while but the colors were distorted, then it would just black out again.It turns out this is a very common ""Black Screen of Death"" that is reported all over the internet and affects this model as well as other Sony camcorders. There is a class-action lawsuit regarding the affected Sony models.Sony of course deny's that there's a problem and wants $289 to fix it. Some who have had it repaired report that the same problem occurs anywhere from 90 days to 1-year after the repair.Stay away from the Sony camcorders until they fix these problems"
2,Motor Noise!,"This camera is great EXCEPT for the motor noise. The hum comes through load and clear when filming school concerts, people talking, or anything else where it is generally quite in the background. Do not buy this camera if this will bother you! I am now buying a $100 external microphone to counteract this problem."
4,Using the Sony LCD in sunlight,"I bought a Sony DCR-TRV22 a few days ago. and am very happy with it. I haven't used all the features yet, but I have downloaded video to computer, printed stills, and had a lot of fun. The size is just perfect. I have one complaint which may make me return the camcorder. You can not use the LCD screen outside on a sunny day. You have to use the viewfinder. I wear glasses, and using a viewfinder all day won't work. I am trying to find out if this is the norm with all camcorders; and then I will have to make a decision. I will keep you posted."
3,camcorder with loose screws,"I bought this camcorder at a chain store. There is a hinge malfunction that prevents me from fully enjoying the capabilities of this nice device. Every time I hold the camcorder from the right side, with one hand, the cassette cover shifts a fraction of a millimeter. This is hardly a tragedy, but it's a darn neussance."
5,Juan struggles against an obsessive bond with his sister,"Juan's self-imposed exile ends with the arrival of his sister, Ana, as he reluctantly resumes their uncestuous relationship. Wanting a normal life, but unable to resist the desire for and comfort in Ana's embrace, his conflicted actions affect those around them in surprising ways.The themes of rebelion and confinement are emphasised by the landscape of this tiny isolated village on the coast of Spain. The original musical score haunts the story, sharpening our experience of Juan's confusion and dispair."
1,NOT in Spanish,"The DVD copy I received (Platinum Studios) is DUBBED IN ENGLISH with no other options. My 1 star rating is for the misrepresentation, not the movie. I will not watch a dubbed film, nor would I have purchased it had I known."
5,WALTER TROUT,"WALTER TROUT'S PLAYING ON LEAD IS PART OF WHY THIS CD IS SO GREAT.THE LIVE VERSION OF ""ROOM TO MOVE"" IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER HEARD!!! I LIKE JOHN MAYALL BUT LOVE WALTER TROUT!!!!"
4,Works great for VOIP,"I purchased this economical headset for VOIP business meetings and it works great. I plug in before launching a WebEx meeting, log in to the web conference, and away I go. Folks in meetings say they can hear me great and without any time delay or echo. I really like being able to hear everyone so clearly, too. The only product surpirse was that the picture of the product shows two earpieces, but the unit I have has only one."
2,Disappointing,"I am an ardent admirer of Bob Moses, and was hoping to read a book which provides a textured glimpse of him; this came nowhere close. Perhaps the trouble is that Moses was an enigmatic figure, difficult for anyone but his close friends and associates to understand. That being the case, repeating this observation--as the book does implicitly and explicitly--hardly illuminateds his character, nor does it make for fascinating reading."
2,could have been good,"As the PW review states, the book is riddled with factual errors--large and small. It is also full of the author's anti-religious and anti-Mormon prejudice; events and people are always cast in the dimmest light (except the author's own ancestor and family) and Denton seems unable to imagine a religious worldview. I would have like more direct quoting from Jean Rio Baker's journals and a more dispassionate point of view that accounted for the reason people of the 19th century were so compelled to leave their home countries to emigrate to Utah and take part in what Mormonism seemed to promise. I bought this book to get a sense--from Jean Rio Baker--of who she was and why she converted to Mormonism, but the factual errors and value judgments cloud the book's credibility so much that it did not really address those issues."
1,Not Quite Sure What This Is,"I was very disappointed while reading this book. Contrary to some reviewers I did not find it compelling and the errors and bias rather put me off. For instance, Wilford Woodruff did not make polygamy illegal (that was the U.S. Government), each Mormon did not have to get married three different ways to make it to heaven, and one could cite pages of similar things. These could all be forgiven, however, were there a strong narrative framework with a consistent, engaging style, but alas..."
3,A Biography Should Be Unbiased,"Denton interprets a British ancestor's experiences in crossing an ocean and a continent to join the Latter Day Saints in Utah. Jean Rio Baker was, by Denton's assessment, a wealthy Victorian woman who ""fell sway"" to the message of Mormon missionaries in the 1840's. Not long after her husband dies, she packed up her children and other members of her extended family and embarked from England on the arduous voyage to Utah.Maybe it was her reality, but there seemed to be too much Mormon bashing in this book. It might have been that way, but as a biographer she certainly didn't take an unbiased view of the whole situation."
2,I Feel Cheated,"I was anticipating a wonderful diary of an amazing journey by an Englishwoman of privilege over the Western Plains of the American West--what I got was a narrative history of the Mormon religion and its ups and downs. Having read many diaries of Pioneer women, this one attracted me because Jean Rio started out in England with a small fortune at her disposal. I was disappointed that so much of the book was wasted on Brigham Young and so little of it on Jean."
1,"Wow, this is really bad","The only good thing about this book is that it was short. Even in writing about a great man with incredible contributions to our country, Gary Hart repeats himself over and over and over and over again. OK, the Monroe Doctrine is important, I GET IT!I read about 2 or 3 presidential biographies per month and I cannot remember a book as bad as this. If you want a quick view of James Monroe, you can read the first chapter and skip the rest but this book is not good for more than that."
3,James Monroe,Times Books president series. Better then most in the series but I am sure it's the man not the writing. I'd find something else on Monroe
2,Playboy Gary Hart -- a Historian?,"All of the titles in this series that I've read so far (six) are admirable efforts, and worth reading. This one is a waste of money. Seek elsewhere."
3,Blandly portrayed greatness,"Gary Hart? Surely a more expository author could have been found to document one of our foremost founders in this presidential biography series. Unfortunately, Hart does less with more than was prudent. The primary focus and seemingly sole legacy that is posited is that of Monroe's delineation of the doctrine of America's realm and destiny for expansion. Not nearly enough coverage of the impact of the Missouri Compromise, his brilliant Cabinet choices and his anti-Federalist philosophy. Monroe deserved better than this tepid effort."
3,Okay,Easy to use and has a pleasant taste but have not noticed any remarkable difference in the color of my teeth
1,Failed Results,"Failed to work as promised, did not alter whiteness at all. Very disappointing for all four people I purchased it for"
2,A Little Bulky,"I love Keens and own two other pairs. These were just too bulky, and I had to send them back."
3,Cute for Outdoorsy Shoes,"The soles of these shoes are incredibly durable. The upper started to wear out after about six months, making the heel area pretty uncomfortable. And unless you have flat feet, you'll probably need foam inserts. However, they were fairly cute and well made."
4,Keens,I like these shoes but they are not as comfortable as other Keens i own. they look nice but i was a little disappointed with the materials that were used. The back of the shoe rubs on my ankle and they seem a little bit heavy for a shoe that is made of a canvas material. It think the heaviness is from the rubber sole.
5,Got what I expected quickly,It works and that is all I ask. Got what I expected quickly. It works and that is all I ask. Got what I expected quickly.
1,Stopped working after about a month of use,After a month this cable began to cause the screen to distort. Just get a longer vga cable.
2,Not New,"I ordered it as a new condition. However, I noticed that it is not a new book. There are some red underlines on the book. It's definitely a used book."
4,Satisfaction? CHECK!,"Aside from the fact that it took awhile to get here, my book was in pristine condition and raring for reading!"
4,like gramma's house.,"First thing my husband said ""like gramma's grandfather clock."" It is very beautiful. The exterior of the clock looks rich without the weight. We like the tones and the option to turn it off at night. Well worth the money. :) However it is a little difficult to program. It took me three tries to get the night option."
4,River city Clock Model 3104C,"We ordered this clock for my 94 year old mother-in-law who cannot see or hear well. She wanted a clock that chimed the quarter hours as well as the hour and in a loud enough tone for her to hear. This one does just that. The only confusion is one she had at first because she did not realize she had to wait for the ""music"" to stop before counting the chimes. It is definitely loud enough for her to hear. However, she is not able to read its face. it is a beautiful clock."
1,Por Que,"As an educator who purchased the book for my classroom library, I was disappointed in what I saw. The book contains violent acts of animals shooting other animals with guns to the point where everything was destroyed. I don't feel the book is appropriate for children."
4,Among the first of its kind...,"""Ball Four"" from Jim Bouton and ""The Jocks"" by Leonard Shecter were the first books I read as a kid that showed professional athletes were human beings rather than icons, and that the idealism and purity of our sports were better taken with a rather large grain of salt. It's no surprise that Shecter served as editor of Bouton's book. I remember being stunned by ""The Jocks"" when it first came out, and although times have changed greatly and tell-all books come out frequently, Shecter's cynical take still manages to be an eye-opener."
3,Perhaps it's just me,"Don't know about all of the other reviewers, but I wear a size 31-32 pants. This Belt is HUGE. Perhaps I'm wearing it wrong, but if you wear it like a normal belt I had a good 2 feet of leftovers (of which I cut off). It's long enough that I could wear it over my sholder (and for a while I did). The adjustability is nice. I can fit katanas, gunblades, sabers, flais. you name it, & it has game for it. Styling on the belt is good looking. A fair buy."
3,Good quality,The belt ordered meet expectations. The vendor was a week later shipping the belt than promised.
4,Works like a charm!,"I purchased this item in order to secure, and be able to wear, a Captain Jack Sparrow Sword. The belt has 2-3 silver pirate skull & crossbones installed along it's perimeter and the leather is high quality. The only issue I have with this item is the size. It's huge/long! There isn't a place to tuck or secure the great length of belt left over after I have it buckled to my waist size, but then I realized that traditionally the left over belt length should be ""tied"" through itself after buckling. Gives it a more authentic look when worn that way. A very good value. The Amazon price on this item is very competitive versus the same item on other costume websites. You'll get many compliments on the authenticity of this rig when used with your costume, or real, sword."
3,nice sword frog.,"the design is nice, would be nicer if it was black. i had to return my first one due to the skulls coming of just after opening the package. but the company was very nice and quick with the replacement."
2,Wrong Item,"The picture shows khaki the invoice says khaki but what I was actually sent is much more of a brown, and thus not authorized for wear with ACUs as these Rothco shirts are usually sold for, shirt quality is still good but the color is wrong. If it really matters what color it is I would recommend buying these at your local BX/PX or ordering it from somewhere a little more military oriented."
2,The Lint it Gives Off Just Isn't Worth It,"I bought and brought this electric blanket home about a week ago. I read the directions and washed it accordingly. I have a conventional down comforter and a big lug of a husband that keeps me warm in bed so my intentions were to keep it on my chair in the den to help keep the chill off while watching TV in my new mountain home. It does not get as hot as I expected, but it's warm and cozy enough --I would prefer that it got hotter though. What I can not stand is the lint that comes off of this thing, it's crazy!!!It EVERYWHERE in my house, everywhere! Big, huge lint balls EVERYWHERE! It gets on my pajamas then in my bed, bedroom, on my rugs, in my den of course, on all my furniture, but worst of all it gets in my MOUTH and UP MY NOSE! I'm completely serious and not exaggerating. It's almost not worth it; I've thrown away conventional blankets for this very reason.I wish I would have known before buying."
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased one of these in January of 2005. The first few months it worked just ok. Never got particularly warm but minimally adequate. By the 2007 season, it barely got warm, even with the control turned up to the maximum. This year, fall 2008, it did not warm at all. Stone cold. I returned it for repair under the warranty and still have not heard back, over a month later.I also have the ""shedding"" problem. Little blue balls and pieces of lint all over the place. I have never had ANY blanket shed like this. Absurd.Conclusion: I would never buy a Sunbeam electric blanket. I would also think twice about buying any of their other products as well."
2,this thing sheds and then broke altogether,"This blanket sheds like crazy. I literally woke up suffocating on blanket fibers a few times. Then, after 30 days, the circuitry went haywire and the thing broke althogether. Not cool."
1,"Poor quality, defective out of the box","Our Sunbeam dual-control electric warming blanket arrived and, despite the flimsy nature of the blanket, we dutifully set it up on the bed. However, only one side of the dual control blanket worked, and then just marginally. The other control flashed an error code. I followed the instructions to ""reset"" the control in the user guide -- which was a chore since the manual was put together incorrectly with the Spanish and English pages interspersed, requiring me to constantly flip the guide to find the right pages. Per the user guide, I checked the blanket for any obvious defects and unplugged and re-plugged the power cord, to no avail. Only half the blanket got even somewhat warm through the night. I called the customer support number and reviewed the problem with them and there was nothing that they could do. This product will be promptly returned, and replaced with a non-Sunbeam brand."
3,Good for Awhile,"We have had this blanket for about 3 years now. I agree with the other reviews that it doesn't last. After 3 years, the preheat just barely warms up and we are turning the temperature settings higher to keep warm. Our thermostat never lets the house below 60 degrees at night. The dual controls are a plus though - my wife likes her side warmer. No issues with the fabric shredding though - we use on top of other blankets."
5,Sunbeam blanket,"We are very happy with the quality of this product. No complaints whatsoever. We haven't had it set beyond 2, and we are very snug."
1,very unhappy,The product is excactly what I ordered I haven't used it yet. Im really upset that my account was pending the purchase when I first order the product then three weeks later the charge shows up. Causing lack off funds to cover it I've had the product for about two weeks. I thought the charge had already went through with the rest of the order.
1,Crap crap mega crap,"I purchased this blanket from Walmart (king sized) and the heating element worked fine, but the blanket (a taupe color) shedded all over my brand new chocolate brown comforter and sheets. I ended up returning it. I'm very disappointed because I liked the mattress cover I bought (had no problems). Sorry Sunbean, this is not the first time I have experienced this with your brand electric blanket. This happened with the same brand blanket years ago.Don't waste your money on this blanket."
1,Electric blanket,It is a dud-very little heat-I have to get another one-I think i will just rely on you for books
3,Warms unevenly but works reliably,"Before I bought this blanket I owned the ""Soft Heat Electric Warming Heated Blanket"" by Perfect Fit Industries, also sold on Amazon. The Soft Heat was a better blanket. It warmed up throughout, whereas the Sunbeam only heats in the middle leaving the sides cold. There were no noticeable wires in the Soft Heat while the Sunbeam has pronounced wires. I even preferred the Soft Heat controls.Sadly, my Soft Heat was a lemon. It short-circuited and fried the control connector. I was offered a replacement but I declined, afraid to get another fire starter, no matter how good it was when it worked. So I bought the second best blanket, the Sunbeam.I still think the Soft Heat is a better blanket. Just pay attention to the connector."
1,Not fresh!,I bought these hoping to get a deal on dried bananas and I got robbed! The banana chips had a weird smell to them. I don't know if this is because of outside climate and shipping but I will not take a chance on them again. Next time I will go to the health food store!
1,"TERRIBLE, you get what you pay for!!","I tried to save money, huge mistake. The black cartridge printed about 20 pages and then was out of ink. What a waste of time, now I need to order what I should have in the first place."
1,Bad ink cartridges,They do not work in the brother dcp-120C. It just bled all over when put in because it wasn't the same design as I've used in the past. Do not buy for this printer.
4,Brother Compatible Ink Cartridge,I ordered the Brother Compatible LC41-4 to replace coupleof my ink catridges in my Brother MFC 420CN machine.They are cheaper than the Brother Compatible ink catridgesI ordered from another online store.The Brother Compatible ink catridges work fine.I will order from this source again.
1,Not worth it,"I know it is much cheaper than the original Brother Ink Cartridges, however, I think it is just not worth it to buy this compatible ink cartridges. When the ink cartridge still has 1/2 full, it tells me to replace the cartridge!!! This is ridiculous."
5,To answer the last review....,"The following is quoted directly from Ravi Shankar in the booklet of his Live at the Monterey International Pop Festival :""As I have often said, I strongly feel that in spite of the drugs, there was really LOVE, PEACE, FLOWER POWER and a genuine passion for beauty and spirituality amongst the youth which I felt gradually died, because of the eploitation of these kids' passion and innocence!"" Ravi Shankar's music is God."
3,Used?,"I bought this as a gift. When I took it out of the package to inspect it, there were very visible scratches and scuffs on the ladybug's 'wings'. That was disappointing. But it works absolutely perfectly and you can't see the scratches when it's actually in the yard."
5,Quality Shams,"They are not cheap, but you do get what you pay for. Excellent quality, heavy fabric, well made, nice product. I highly recommend the set."
3,Needs maturing,"This is the only slide show creation program I could find that allows you to sync your slides to a soundtrack using a graphical interface. The program has some nice transitions but the movements are very crude and don't allow tweaking. Also, when doing a pan, it does only a small section of the image, so it's not very useful. Also crashes a lot, especially as you are completing the program.BUGGY as an ant farm."
4,Cachet Dusting Powder,"""Cachet"" has been my Step Mother's favourite scent, I knew when she could't find it in the shops and she was very disappointed when she couldn't buy it anymore. Stuck for an idea for her Xmas present, it suddenly ""clicked"" that the internet could help. I managed to get the scent, but wondered if there was talc (dusting powder)I hunted everywhere with no luck then I tried ""Amazon"" and found the one I wanted, I have to say it was extremely expensive, 21, but I wanted it, so I bought it. It came very quickly, so I'm pleased about that, but the price was high."
3,Hot at the top!,"If you want to know about what the life of a furnace worker is like, this is probably the book for you. It's got plenty of long words and some quite good pictures, but the writing was a bit small for me. I like big writing. Anyway this has a lot of steel in it, which is probably a good thing for a steely sort of author like Charles Rumford Walker. Enjoy enjoy!"
4,made with passion,the video is accurate and covers all the races extensively.Very interesting are the on board cameras and the interwiews.
1,can't use it!,"I received the 2006-2007 calendar in march 2007. I expected to receive the 2007-2008 version. With only three month's left on it, I could not use it and returned it. I spent about $10.00 dollars in shipping charges that are not reimbursed. I was very disappointed to receive an old calendar."
5,Rare Gem,"It is extremely rare that a complete unknown band can floor me with their talent and impeccable craft. This band is now one of my favorite, even though they have only released one album. The arrangements are sophisticated, the vocals are hauntingly gorgeous yet upbeat, the melodies are first rate, and the production values are to die for. To hear it is to love it. Everytime I play this CD, people will ask me who they are. It's that good."
2,One song wonder,"Dang, I hate it when this happens! Like so many others, I heard the title track on a chillout station on internet and/or satellite radio. Looked over the CD on iTunes, thought the description sounded good. Bought the CD here on Amazon (cuz I'm cheap like that, $0.89 is better than $9.99 any day), and as it happens, the title track is really the ONLY song that has the nice feel I was after. While the other tracks are acceptable, they are NOT more of the ""Is This Real"" feel. In my book: Limp fail. Oh well, better luck next time."
2,Not for the lay person,I buy numerous psychology books in my attempts to better understand aclose relative with a psychiatric disorder. I was looking forward to readingthis book after encountering references to it on the web but it isn't easilyunderstandable for the lay person or illuminating.
4,Irreverent delight,"Peachment led me on an engaging and entertaining adventure through Caravaggio's life. I was not the least concerned by anachronisms and inaccuracies. What I got was an ""artist's impression"" - and I loved it.Do yourself a favour if you plan to read this book: get hold of a book of Caravaggio's pictures so that you can study each picture while reading ""Caravaggio's"" description of it. I bought Timothy Wilson-Smith's ""Caravaggio"" and went back and reread Peachment's book. There's great delight in comparing Wilson-Smith's formal and presumably ""accurate"" analysis with Peachment's (""Caravaggio's"") irreverent possibly inaccurate account."
5,Real-world projects make language more understandable.,I found this a great book for beginners who want to actually DO something with the language once they understand something about it.
4,Overall good but for Beginner to Intermediate,"Overall good book after a slow start. The book claims to be intended for ""Intermediate to Advanced"" users but is too simple for anyone with any experience. It's five chapters before the reader launches Visual Basic and then continues to move fairly slowly. I didn't expect so much hand holding in a ""hands on"" ""intermediate to advanced"" book. Author occasionally meanders during tutorials when the meandering material would have been better served in an appendix. There are some good tips and the author points out good programming practices/conventions but inconsistently follows them. There are some misspellings, omissions and inaccuracies between the text and the CDROM but nothing that should preclude the reader from finishing the tutorial projects. Overall a good primer."
1,Wow! This really is that bad!,"To everyone on this list who is convinced that this is a great film, let me suggest that you try Macross Plus, Ghost in the Shell, or the eternal Akira. If you want great martial arts, look no further than Ruronui Kenshin or Hakkenden. As for this one...just stack all the movies that you are going to watch on top of it."
3,An Excellent Anime,"In response to the pyro maniac above I have to say that you sir deffinantly to need take some medication. I personally thought that the movie was good. If for no other reason then that it blows away any other anime Ive ever seen as far as blood and violence. Personally I think Ninja Scrolls is the anime master piece, but Fist isn't all that bad. You really need to seek medical help if you feel the need to burn the movie."
4,Violence extream!,"Boaring at points, this is still worth watching. If you love violent movies, this is one of the most graphicly violent ever put out. Nothing on the order of Akira or Ninja Scroll, but still recomended. One of the favorites of my anime collection."
4,Extremly good manga classic!!!,"Superb manga classic that will have playing and rewinding your VHS player over and over again! Highly recommented, even if your not a manga/anime fan!"
5,pointless yeah right this thing is awsem!,"if your like me and you like action and blood in a movie than ge this movie its the best of the blood and guts. The only thing i thought it was lacking was the animation, it was'nt as good as say akira but im not marking it down for that!"
2,Avoid this dribble,"Japanese animation is awesome, but Fist of the North Star(Hokuto no Ken) doesn't do it justice. Potentially a good series, this movie plays through events inanely. If you have seen this movie than you would have noticed the similarities to Mad Max (earth after nuclear holocaust, street thugs pillage and murder the innocent). I also have to say that the dubbing is terrible, which is one of the reasons I was turned off by this movie. If you really want to see FNS, see the OAV television series, they are much better."
4,best villian of the series cuz he lasts the longest,"The Colonel has one one of the best sequences with Ken of any villian in the series. I also prefer the more dramatic music of the subbed to the tecno of the dubbed, but both are tolerable."
1,This is a waste of space,"For those of you who rated this above three stars, you will perish in flames. Have any of you ever seen good anime? If you have not, go get some. If you have seen good anime, and then had the balls (respectively) to give this piece of...poop a good rating, then you clearly have no idea what good anime is. It took me three tries to make it all the way through the film, and when I did, I promptly burned the tape. Then I went to the video store, rented another, and burned it as well so that so I felt that I had done my good deed for the day. Please, if you must see this film, watch it at a friend's house. Save your rental money for anime that has both 1)a good story, and 2)well rendered drawings."
5,A wonderful book,"My mother read this story to my sister and I when we were young, 30 some years ago. We loved it then and still have fond memories of the story. Mom still has the book on her bookshelf and I was delighted to find it here so I can get my own copy to read to my children. Additionally, there is a great recipe on the back for Old Witches magic nut cake. My mom has made it since we were little girls and now that we are grown, we make it for our own families and they love it as much as we do!"
3,Old Witch,"While I was thrilled to get a book as old as this one, I was a little disappointed in the condition of the book. It wasn't quite as good as it was rated to be."
1,This book stinks,"Of the roughly 15 certification study guides (for various certifications) that I read over the last 4 months, this one is by far the worst!! This book reads like it was written by a committee and then not edited at all. The organization is atrocious, the book is riddled with typographical, grammatical and technical errors - several per page - and the technial information presented that is needed to pass the exam is incomplete. For example, the tables that list the specifications for the different SCSI standards is simply incomplete. Also, this book is a perfect example of why sophisticated desktop publishing tools do not belong in the hands of amateurs: the book is over-designed to the point that the layout and design in many places is very distracting. After having taken the exam, I seriously doubt that I could have passed it if I would have relied on this book alone."
2,Not Organized,"The publisher seems to have come up with their own version of the CompTIA Server+ exam objectives. The exam objectives in this book certainly do not match the Server+ exam objectives that are published by CompTIA. Of the six names listed in the book, none of the four contributors (authors) are Server+ certified (although they all have other certifications), the technical editor is Server+ certified, the Technical reviewer is not. This lack of certification on Server+ shows, as the book contains many errors and is very light on both SCSI and RAID, both of which are big areas on concern on the Server+ exam."
1,TODDLER BROKE HIS LEG,"THIS IS not a toy for unsupervised children, no matter their age. My son, only 2 years old was very badly injured (broken leg in two places) due to being run over by another child as they came down the ramp. Have now been to the doctor on 5 occasions over 5 months and the damage is still evident to his bone. This is not a safe toy period. The ramp up the middle of the toy is not a safe place to enter the ramp, the sides at that the kids slide down does not have any rails, and the speed that the car reaches as kids ride down the ramp is too excessive. NOT A GOOD TOY FOR KIDS. this should be pulled off the market!!!!!"
5,Neat and nice looking and get organized,"All my DVD are neatly stored. When the boxes stack together, they look good. I don't open the box often so all boxes stay buttoned so far. If the button is getting loose I'm thinking to use crazyglue to glue it together. Hope it won't happen."
5,It does the job,"This product is well made and I am happy with the quality, I have purchased other like products that had to be taped to keep them from falling apart. this one really works"
4,I need a replacement bottom,"On one of the bottoms the snaps on one side were ""off"" and it will not snap together. One snap is OK and the other is too low. Would it be possible for me to get another bottom part as it will not close correctly. Thank you for any assistance in this matter."
2,Popping Open,"Boxes are nice looking, and I love that they are 50% post consumer. However, they don't stay snapped. If you snap them and put them away, they are fine, but if you pick them up and touch near the corners at least one snap pops open."
5,EXCELLENT!,these boxes are perfect - I was concerned that they might not be sturdy and big enough for DVD series sets and they ARE! It is important to make sure the snaps are really snapped and once they are they have stayed snapped:)
3,"Works, but not great","For a box designed specifically for DvDs I expected this to be relatively snug on the side so they can't move around. Instead there is an entire inch of space... so the DvDs move around.. not to mention the extra space it takes up for absolutely no reason.It stays together fine so far. The lid is a bit loose so I don't think it is the greatest long term storage option, but it makes it easier to remove/replace which works well for something to keep movies or games you watch/play frequently."
1,Junk,"Wow, how anyone can give this 5 stars is WAY beyond me. It's the most expensive paper I've ever purchased. Not even as sturdy as the box it was shipped in - I was afraid it would rip apart just pulling it out of the wrapper. I returned it almost as soon as I got it open. What a complete waste of time and money - spare yourself the agony and pass this by."
2,buttons will not stay snapped,"The buttons on these will not stay snapped. I bought these to hold my kids video games, but the buttons kept coming undone and of course the games would fall into the floor. Hope this helps"
2,"Easy, Light Storage","Excellent for controlling that messy DVD collection (just be sure to keep a master list or database of DVD location!). The boxes snap together in seconds. They seem flimsy but once filled are firm enough to stack 2 or 3 high; I wouldn't try for higher. These are the cheapest solution for DVD storage that looks well, but since inexpensive, they are rather fragile. Despite some ads that refer to 'leather' these are made of library paper over cardboard - so don't get them wet, and don't drag them over each other or the paper will fray. Caution: We ordered lots of them and several sets were badly damaged - frayed or crushed corners. AMAZON* was very quick to replace them. Still, since they are not carefully packed I would buy future ones locally where I could examine them first. *: The replacements were very well packed."
3,There are NOT 2 boxes in the pack.,"The product is just fine and will last about like a shoebox would, but looks much better. However, be warned that there is only one storage box in the order, not 2 as in the description."
3,"Works as intended, but quality is middling","I have to say I was a bit disappointed in the quality of these boxes. They were a bit flimsy and on one of them the ""buttons"" don't stay snapped shut. In addition, the one I bought had some label on it which, when peeled off, removed some of the black paper from the box itself. I think if you don't go in and out of these boxes often, they are probably fine, but if you intend to use the boxes often they probably won't last too long."
5,easy access media storage,"Since I am unable to read a book anymore, I buy audio books. I used to read a lot, now I listen a lot. At least 50 since February. I do send many to my brother, but there are some I would like to hear again. Now I am tripping over stacks of these CD's. I did read reviews about these boxes but they still seemed to be the best option of products available. Some of the snaps do want to come apart. I used my trusted E6000 glue. I don't plan on taking the box apart for storage. I want them to stay together & that's exactly what they are doing. I have them on my closet shelf & my bedroom mess is gone! I would recommend these to everone."
4,Good Storage Box,"This box does exactly what it is supposed to do. Give the user good, affordable storage with a small footprint. We use these at our church and find them great for what we need."
4,Works great,The box came quickly and snapped together very easily. I bought 2 and may buy a couple more when I fill up the second one.
4,Smelly boxes,These storage boxes are just as they appear and they are going to work for us just fine - they do fit DVD's as promised. My one negative comment is that they have that bad plastic smell that seems to go along with certain plastic items. It pretty much went away after airing them out in the garage but with the lid on has come back a bit when the lid comes off. This wouldn't be a problem if we were just using for storing in the garage but the plan is to store DVD's in the family room in them so....I'm hoping it goes away. Not enough of a negative to return them but I can't recommend them whole heartedly. The price was right.
3,Good enough,"Not really all that sturdy, but if you don't plan on pulling it out of the shelf (or wherever you will store it) and opening it a lot, then it's good for storage."
2,Won't buy these again,"I love the idea of these. Storage boxes don't need to be super fancy or anything, but if it's a snap that is holding the box together, perhaps it would be good to have the snaps line up? Got two boxes. One snap on each box didn't work. Luckily I had some black duct tape so I just taped the box together. But now what COULD have looked halfway decent when displayed looks pretty cheap. I still like the boxes, just be aware that there may be some problems when you put them together."
3,Nice overall but I received a defective lid on one storage box.,"I've ordered this before and liked it very much so I decided to order another set. I still like the product but on one of the storage box lids, one of the metal corners was loose and missing a rivet. The person that placed this in the box for shipment should have noticed the problem. It would be nice to get one replacement lid so I can rate it 5 stars. Can you send one out to me please."
2,Shallow Assessments Cloud And Demean The Genre,"This survey is the weak link in Routledge's stellar 'Genres in Context' series. The author's assessments of what he considers fantasy classics (Chapters 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7) are more perfunctory summaries than perspicacious critiques; the reader often has to construct thematic concerns from the motifs and details which the author haphazardly limns. The one chapter devoted to the history of modern fantasy (Chapter 1) is woefully inadequate, failing to inform the uninitiated reader of the true depth and breadth of fantastical writing. (A comparison to Brooks Landon's supernal post-1900 science fiction survey - also from the 'Genres in Context' series - makes the lacunae in this survey all the more evident.) This tome - if in its brevity, it can be called such - serves only as a poignant reminder of the dearth of comprehensive and pensive scholarship on the fantasy genre."
4,It's a cable,I used this cable to connect my ipod to the connection in my trunk. I was getting a lot of interference with some of my old cables. It works great now. The problems are as follows:- the cable isn't quite long enough even for a small car- the cable is very stiff so it won't bend well. If you are hooking it up to an ipod it will make your ipod stay in a specific position- the end of the cable is big. I wanted to use this for my sirius radio but it wouldn't fit because the end is bigI ended up getting an extension cable that would address these issues.
4,Monster at the top of its game...,"Monster has always had the reputation to being the best in quality for their products... When you think of wires, you cannot help think of Monster Cable... I used this cable to connect my carputer to my factory head unit... Ran up the middle of the car, grouped with a VGA cable and multiple USB cables, there is no feedback at all.. i was worried the VGA feed may leak into this cable but monster did not let me down.. I highly recommend this product... but as others on here have stated.. little pricey... in the end 'you get what you pay for!'"
3,These cables are Stiff...!!!,"If you want a cable that's Twisty & Flexable then these cables are Not for you..But if you want Strong ""Stiff"" Tuff Cables then these Monster cables will work out Great!!If only the prong end of the cable was more Flexable :o(I hope this review helps..Curtis,"
4,Not dead yet!,"Not so much a review of this album, as a correction of misinformation from one of the previous reviewers. McGillicuddys are still going strong, and have the exact same line up as appeared on this CD (yes, including the accordion player, who only took a break to have a family). McGillicuddys have released a brand new full length CD this year called Sin Lane, at this time available from[...] See reviews for this CD on the site. Check it out - I personally think it's awesome. The band have also just release a song for Victoria Highlanders FC, so perhaps a eulogy is premature."
3,Kilt by Death may be this band's eulogy,The McGillicuddy's first and probably only CD. What was a promising band in 2002 is now near the end; the accordian player is gone and the vocalist is on his way out. So get this CD and keep it as a collector's item in your celtic rock collection. Good solid covers. A few original tunes but nothing else likely to come from this Victoria BC band. Just more covers getting performed at home these days. The accordian was truely the spark of this band.
5,Take me back...,"I'm watching the movie right now, probably 30 years since the last time I saw it. I love it. Am I a sucker for the 80's? Yes. Does that negate the fact that this is an adorable film with an equally adorable soundtrack? No WAY!People, experience all that is Xanadu. Leave the stuffiness behind and adore what Olivia Newton John and Michael Beck are in this movie. Yes, it's light-hearted and fun loving. No, it's not serious with a heavy plot. Release those expectations and retain your sense of humor and you will enjoy the movie, especially if you grew up in the 80's.Relax. It's all good. :)"
5,A '80s Gem,The '80s produced some wonderful music and musical performers. ELO and Olivia Newton-John are two such examples. The music in Xanadu reflects the style and energy we remember the '80s having. As a DVD all the camp of the original movie is there in wonderful clarity and sound.The scene where the 40's big band merges with the '80s rock group has to be one of the great musical scenes on film. Would that that scene could be extended !!!A wonderful blend of the music style of the 40's epitomized by Gene Kelly and the 80's pop by Olivia Newton-John. This is a real treasure.
5,Wonderful and nostalgic,"I am a listener of things like Lustmord, Roach... dark ambient and tribal, atmospheric grooves... but when I listened to the samples of Xanadu, I was catched by the beauty and nostalgy of its music. Even more impacting is the fact that, since I moved to the US from Spain, Xanadu brings me the memory of those early years in which I barely knew anything about music, when I was a kid, memories from a former phase in my life... This soundtrack is a joy in the history of music and is worthwhile the money."
3,"Yes a few good songs, but mishmash of strange movie",ELO did well here and Olivia and wsa a nice attempt at tryin to be a bit out there offering of eclectic music like the movie...ok album
4,Xanadu - A Musical Delight,I have just watched Xanadu starring Olivia Newton John & John Travolta. The music and choreography are a delight to experience and the story an enjoyable one. The characters are very likeable and the dance scene in the garage excellent. This is a love story with a magical twist combining old with modern music and song perfectly. Gene Kelly steals the screen in the dance scene with Olivia however that's not to say our Olivia didn't perform outstandingly. On the whole a delightful experience.
4,Xanadu - full 12 track version still required by ONJ fans.,Excellent album (5+5) prod by John Farrar(Shadows) and Jeff Lynne(ELO).A 10 track remastered version of this CD album from Festival records few years ago.Nobody has ever put out the full 10+2 B sides (Fool country+1) yet?Recommended purchase. marks out of 10: 10/10.
3,Some great tunes but not worthy of a CD release,"While the album has some real gems and a recording from what was Gene Kelly's final musical, this release is a disappointment. It is literally the original vinyl release and nothing more. There were a slew of B-Sides (ex Drum Dreams and Fool Country) plus a version of the title song recorded with Jeff Lynne on vocals and they're not here. A bit of a rip for a CD unless there's no other way to get the existing music."
4,Just saw the Broadway show!,"let's face it the movie sucks; the soundtrack is pretty great (with nostalgia's glow). so, i was sooo shocked by the stage version. the creators figured that taking a crappy, dated film and sending it up is, if not easier, better than trying to recreate a classic. trust me, that's the only reason i looked at this listing, haha. it made me realize that even the crap from our past can be good enough to look back on fondly."
4,"Xanadu: A True Masterpiece, In every sense of the word","I have seen the movie countless times. Olivia Newton-John is a true beauty in this musical.Gene Kelly and Olivia make an absolutely dynamic dance pair in ""Whenever you're away from me"" and ELO & Olivia stole the show when they sang the title song. I owned the LP many years ago, but that has faded out of existance, but I have plans to purchase the CD very shortly. In conclusion, the original soundtrack from Xanadu,as well as the motion picture,is a true Hollywood masterpiece in every sense of the word. It has absolutely breathtaking special photographic effects, great musical arrangements from John Farrar and Jeff Lynne, and finally some really beautiful love scenes with Michael Beck and Olivia Newton-John. Get the CD, please. You are in for a real treat. You will not be disappointed."
4,I love the music,I bought the CD (I'm sure I have the tape somewhere) after going to see Xanadu the musical on Broadway. These songs are great. These are the best songs by ELO and some of the best by Olivia Newton-John.
5,I love Xanadu,"I've been a big fan of this movie and soundtrack since I was a kid so I may be a little bias, but if you like the movie you'll mostly likely like the soundtrack as well. Nice 80s music."
4,A great soundtrack for fans of this genre.,"Finally, I can have the soundtrack on CD! I have searched for the last 10 years, only to be told it hadn't been released on CD. I have the original LP album, as well as a cassette tape, but needless to say that they tend to wear out over a period of 20 years. A great compilation of ONJ and ELO...gotta have it!"
3,ELO in the soundtrack biz,"Despite the overall danciness of the Discovery album, I was initially excited to hear that ELO would be providing the soundtrack to a movie. I caught Xanadu on the day it opened, dragging a carload of friends to see what I was sure would be a classic. Five minutes into the movie it sunk in and the threats started. I had dragged my friends to a roller-disco movie and my reputation would never be the same. That aside, ELO contributed several decent songs to the soundtrack. ""I'm Alive"", ""Don't Walk Away"" and ""All Over The World"" were at least listenable and worthy of inclusion on any ELO compilation you might care to build. Other than that, there's way too much sugar and far too little spice."
3,one star for every song I liked,"The movie stunk, but the soundtrack isnt bad. I like Jeff Lynn's contribution to the album with ""all over the world"" Cliff Richard also does a nice duet w/Olivia in ""suddenly"" I have the soundtrack on audio tape, would I buy Xanadu on cd??? only if I could get it for under 10$."
5,What Fun!,"This soundtrack is just plain fun! Actually, the music is good, and it's even better if it's NOT taken out of context. It's a great soundtrack, but it stands much stronger once you've seen the movie first. (Some soundtracks, like Purple Rain, stand well on their own, movie or not.) Regardless--Xanadu (movie, CD, or both) is a fun look back at the 80s before they really became the 80s, you know what I mean? Before there was Boy George and A Flock of Seagulls, there was Xanadu."
3,Xanadu soundtrack,"This is my guilty pleasure, the songs are great. my only quibble is the fact that there are only 10songs, the songs which are sung at the end of the film in the club, i/e/ the country & rock etc are not included. Otherwise it's a great soundtrack, if you liked the film you'll love the soundtrack."
5,Easy way to read this book,"This book is very much like the adult version only with pictures. It would be good for later elementary ages through probably middle school. Being a teacher of lower elementary, I enjoyed it myself!"
4,Change: The only thing we can count on,"Change is the only thing we can count on. Who Moved My Cheese for Kids reflects this and is the inspiration for my writing for children. Although change can make us uncomfortable, and frightened it also makes US. It is who we are. We are always changing. We are always growing. How we cope with change is something we learn very early on in life and something that may create a daunting or happy transition, depending on our experience. But think about this... without change where would we be? Would we get around on cars or horses, would we be able to read this review? Change is a natural part of our being. Our trouble is not being able to accept it. Imagine a caterpillar not wanting to be a butterfly ... as if it has a choice. As an author of such a story I can say that The Caterpillar that Wouldn't Change is the unfortunate one. Ultimately if we can't accept change, we are really missing out on something beautiful."
4,On their level - and ours too!,"I am a fan of the adult version of this book, so when I saw it came out in a children's version, I had to have it. We're a military family, so change is one constant in our lives. We're about to make a move which will be the first one my 5 year old daughter is really aware of. I introduced this book to her, and even though she doesn't quite understand the real meaning of the story, I'm hoping it will be a way to remind her that change is a good thing. She'll already have the lessons tucked away in her mind, so hopefully when she's in the midst of a change, it will mean something to her. The pictures are wonderful, as is the story. My kids love it and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is dealing with change. It's an optimistic view of whatever changes come into our lives."
5,Riot!,"My husband had been given the adult version of this book a few years ago when a new young VP came into power at his company. Our 4 year old is an old soul who likes things the same, day in, day out. We bought it for him. It's wonderful. He enjoyed it and it helps open up dialog about the changes in his little world. And it's realy funny when Dad reads it!"
3,I was surprised when 4 & 5 year olds enjoyed this book.,"I read this book to some of the 4 and 5 year-olds in the preschool classroom I am currently working at and I was surprised at how much some of them enjoyed it. Some of the children were begging me to read it over and over and over. The book is quite long compared to other books for children this age range so I was very surprised when it kept their attention. I don't think that the message of the book is very understandable for most children of this age, but they enjoy the pictures and predicting what will happen next in the story. One of the kids in my class even borrowed this one because he wanted to share it with his grandma."
4,excellent work,"Betty Adcock's poetry is truly wonderful. She writes with clarity, grace, humor, and anyone who reads her poems, can't help but love them. This book has some of the best poems written, like ""Southbound"" and ""Voyages"". This book is a must for every person who loves southern poetry, and I recommend it for anyone who loves poetry."
5,National Geographic Traveler - Egypt,"The only book one needs to take on a tour of Egypt. I found this book informative, up to date and easier to use than those I had previously purchased. I learned of this book when I saw fellow travel companions reading theirs. Since returning from my trip to Egypt I purchased the book to further my research and edit my photographs."
5,Make exquisite looking quilts with strips!,"This is an excellent book for a new or experienced quilter who wants to make a fantastic, complicated looking quilt using the secret of strips. My Blooming 9 Patch is my most exquisite project to date! This book would make a lovely gift for anyone who loves making quilts"
5,Certainly A Classic!,"I took a class with this wonderful, spunky lady a few years ago. She makes HUGE quilts, and this book has a great selection of variations. The sizes only include either very large, or baby. But the designs are so simple!"
5,Very Useful,I love this book. I've made a couple of quilts using it and plan to make a few more. I've gotten nothing but rave reviews on the quilts I made using this book and I can't recommend it highly enough. I purged through my quilt book collection and got rid of most of them but this book stayed in my top ten list. The use of color alone is worth the price of the book.
4,Blooming Nine Patch Pattern is Great,I love quilts that look difficult but are really pretty easy to piece. The Blooming Nine Patch Pattern was easy to piece and makes a beautiful quilt.
3,Kindle Edition,"I was disappointed that the Kindle edition is only in black and white - no color photos included. It is difficult to enjoy the quilt samples without color included. The directions are clear and easy to follow, but black and white pictures are not inspiring"
3,Tammy Wynette - Stand By Your Man,"I bought this CD because I liked Tammy's version of Stand By Your Man. I did not enjoy listening to the rest of the CD because I am not a big fan of Tammy but if you are, you will probably like the CD."
5,A great treasure that should have never been out of print.,A fantastic album that reveals Tammy's extraordinary talent. There will never be another. I had the great honor and blessing of knowing Tammy as a friend and fan.
1,Yuccchhh!,"Maybe it had just been too long (since high school in the '80s), but P.U., this fragrance made me and everyone around me feel so ill, I had to go home and shower in the middle of the day. Fragrance is highly subjective, so I'm not knocking those who wear this. I suspect it works better with their chemistry. Red by Giorgio was a big, bombastic, complicated '80s fragrance with a thick wallop of jasmine and sandalwood, and A Little Sexy is a fairly faithful copy thereof. If you're not up for that sort of thing-- it is VERY different from current fragrance trends-- then proceed with caution here. The packaging for A Little Sexy claims it is ""soft and subtle."" Only if a sledgehammer is mild and gentle."
5,A Whole Lot of Fun!,"Bill Wallace brings our friends Upchuck and Rotten Willy back again for another fast-paced adventure. This time Rotten Willy leaves the safety of his backyard and gets in trouble each step of the way. Upchuck can't figure out how his lovable friend can get in so much trouble! But, he's there to rescue his doggy pal from danger. Good read for 3rd-6th graders and excellent as a book to read to children. Only problem, you can't put it down!"
3,Upchuck and the Rotten Willy,I thought this book was [too] similar to other books that have cats and dogs becoming best friends. This book was not good for me because it is [too] low in reading level. I recomend this book for a 4th grader.To me this book was boring. I thought the book would be good for elementry kids.
1,Inferior,"Permatex is a respected name. But I don't respect this product. As lead polymer chemist for a Fortune 500 company, I dare say that if I had problems with the procedure, most layman will. Awkward! Clumsy! Ineffective! I've used similar products with much more ease and success. I'll never consider this system again."
2,resin tube is empty,"do not buy it !!!!I follow the instruction, 1,2,3,4 and then found the tube is empty ,there is not any resin inside !!!!I return it.CommentFinally, I check the tube again, it is not really empty, I found one drop ."
3,Good,"This product may or may not have stopped the chip in my windshield from turning into a crack. But it does not work as simulated. Try it for yourself, yu may get other results."
3,Did not work as stated in the Instructions,"Maybe I used this when the glass was too warm, but I was not able to get a solid/good glass to nozzle seal in order to inject the resin. I did not like the setup though either."
4,The product works but there is a negative.,"I was surprise to see so many people have problems with this product. I had a pretty big bullseye. I'm sure a bullseye is easier to fix than a star damage but the product worked for me. And now after using the Permatex, its pretty much disappeared. It's definitely not noticeable anymore. I actually like the syringe technique of sucking out the air bubbles first and then using air pressure. It makes perfect sense.The negative is that it's for only one use. I have 4 cracks that I want to fix so it would be very expensive to fix them all. They should given more resin, another adhesive disk, etc. for atleast 2 uses."
1,Failed to Work,"I have a very small (approximately 0.25"") star and crack in my windshield caused by a rock. Far less than the 12"" this product is supposed to work on. I used this product and followed the directions for my type of crack. The clear stuff took well over 1 hour at 51 degrees F to dry, and I can still see the crack in my windshield. It just doesn't work."
1,Don't waste your time and money on this,"I carefully read the instructions and watched the video on Permatex's website and followed them to a tee. Like the other (mostly) negative reviewers noted, the adhesive on the ""suction"" cup tore away from the plastic upon removal. Luckily, I had a bottle of isopropyl alcohol and rags handy to clean up the dark gooey mess left on my windshield. The rest of the procedure went as planned, but the results were poor. I had a small bulls-eye with 4-5 spider legs extending out. After the repair, the spider legs were 50% better, but the bulls-eye was still there as before. Fortunately, the chip was on the lower passenger side area so hopefully it won't get any worse."
5,Gets the job done!,"Got a star chip while on the freeway, just less than an inch wide or high. Checked reviews on various brands, watched YouTube vids, chose Permatex in the end. I'll agree, tube of resin should be see through to know how much your using before the last step. Anyhoo, followed directions to the T and have to say, all that's left of the chip is a small blemish. Exactly what Permatex warns you about on the package. Now I don't have to worry about it spreading and having to replace my windshield for $200 or paying a repair guy to come out for $100. Tip: Unfortunately I used most of the resin before the last step, so a lot was waiting for me when I removed the pedestal and adhesive. Take the adhesive and use it to spread remaining resin over the ""almost repaired chip"", then place yellow film over it taped on both sides. Move car if need be to direct sunlight, use razor blade to clear out air bubbles, have a beer and wait 15 minutes!"
1,Terrible product!!,"I have a very small bullseye crack in my windshield (less than .25"") and tried this. The instructions are not great, but common sense helps past that flaw. This product, however, is terrible. Fluid did not penetrate at all in the crack and, in fact, ran down my windshield with the ease of pouring water on my windshield. Product never filled crack, never cured. Definately try something else."
1,permatex windshield repair,"This product failed to repair my bullseye damage on my windshield. I don't believe that the resin ever reached the cracks. It looked just the same as it did before the repair. I used some other product several years ago on a similar bullseye with outstanding results. The repaired area looked like no damage had ever occurred. I believe the problem with the Permatex product is that the resin is too thick to be pulled into the cracks, even after creating the vacuum. The resin needs to be very low in viscosity and low in surface tension to flow into the crack. If the resin never flows into the crack, the crack will always show. I called Permatex and they said that maybe the product was old, so I went back to Auto Zone and they gave me my money back. I wish I could remember the brand of product I used several years ago when I had such good results. The resin was water thin and required several hours in the sun to cure but it was definately worth it."
1,Doesn't Work -- No Help From Tech Support,"I followed the instructions meticulously trying to repair a small star in one windshield and a several-inch-long crack in another. Both windshields had been damaged less than a week before and had been kept clean and dry since then.This stuff doesn't flow into cracks and doesn't harden in sunlight at all. Permatex customer support said it was working as designed, and suggested I recontact them for instructions on how to get a refund. Not much consolation for my wasted time and two windshields contaminated with whatever this chemical may be and therefore made unrepairable."
2,Doesnt work on scratches,"My windshield has scratches, not cracks, and this did not work for them. Guess I should have read the product description more thoroughly."
5,first check on youtube,"hi folks,first check on youtube what is this thing and how it works, and then you will need no further comments...good luck"
5,"Great, but...","The songs here are great but so many are missing. For the cost (at this time about $47 used) I'd kick in a little more and buy the two imports to get 30 wonderful tracks. (""It's Gonna Take a Miracle"" and ""The Elegant Sound of the Royalettes"") All of the tracks on this CD appear on those two.If you haven't heard of The Royalettes you're really missing something! See the above mentioned CDs for more reviews..."
5,Introduction to the History of Anti-Semitic Thought,"This book was a textbook for a class I took on the Holocaust. I have since read other works by Jacob Katz and I find his work to be well-written, even for people who are not academics, and thorough in its approach. This book in particular offers an excellent survey of the development of anti-Judaic and anti-Semitic thought throughout European history. If you are interested in understanding the sources of anti-Semitic thought and race theory as phenomena that culminated in the Holocaust and other modern manifestations of the genocidal impulse, this book is a must. The things Katz highlights and discusses will blow your mind. By the time I finished the book, I understood so much more about how things like the Holocaust could happen in the first place."
1,Monster Cables are just Marketing hype ....,I currently own a pair of Monster Z series speaker cable ... They are ok but definitely NOT worth that money... My mistake is your gain!!!!
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I ORDERED THIS RING AND RECEIVED SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT.OF COURSE I RETURNED IT AND GUESS WHAT. AMAZON SAID IT WAS NOT THEIR PRODUCT AND REFUSED TO REFUND MY MONEY.THEY SAID THEY INSPECT ALL PRODUCTS BEFORE SHIPMENT YET A FEW DAYS LATER I PURCHASED A CAMERA AND AGAIN I RECEIVED A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CAMERA FROM WHAT I ORDERED.SOMETHING CHEAPER OF COURSE. BUYER BEWARE.ACTURALLY NO STARS FOR WHAT I RECEIVED.
4,Great ring for a easy to swallow price,Bought this ring after returning another in the same style but had only .25 cttw. This one was much better and was not much more for twice the amount of diamonds.One of the seven diamonds was slightly cloudy but the others were not too bad.
5,The most amazing vacuum ever!,"My friend and I both bought one of these because we both have pets and lots of pet hair. As soon as we received them and used them for the first time we were on the phone with each other raving about these vacuums. I have cats and allergies so I've always vacuumed frequently, and kept my carpet what I thought to be pretty clean. Even so, I had to empty the Dyson canister 5 times the first time I used it because it picked up so much hair that my other vacuum had left behind. Amazing!! It is also VERY easy to use. I love it! Thank you Dyson!!"
4,Sula by Toni Morrison.,"I found the book, Sula, to be very interesting. The author tries to make the reader understand the life of the blacks in the early 1900's. She writes about the way the blacks had to survive. This book deals with friendship, love, and betrayal. One of the quotes that I found to be very important to the book was, ""That was to much. To lose Jude and not have Sula to talk to about it because it was Sula that he had left her for."" This is a symbol of Sula's betrayal towards Nel. This book also uses a repetitive pattern. It always flashes back to earlier scenes, in order to decribe what is going on. If you are into comedy then you would like this book. Also people who want to learn more about life for the blacks in the 1900's would also like this book. Even if you don't like any of those things, this book also deal with all the different things that do go on in life in todays society."
4,What a deal,"I must admit, Toni Morrison (after reading 3-4 of her books) isn't my type of writer; however, this collection is so much cheaper than getting each book one by one especially if you are the type of reader who prefers hardcover editions. Each book has a simple M on the cover and the back binding has the title and they all have a feel which makes you feel like you are sitting in a chair, near a fireplace, and smoking a pipe.The books themselves have varied quality, writing wise, and I must admit that some of them I have little or no taste for, but all the while I'm glad I can at least have an opinion of the author whose name I kept hearing but have never even heard of a single of her works."
4,Almost a 5 star item....,"This would have been 5, but I feel the design is just asking to be broken. I have yet to break mine, but the minijack isnt as stable as I would like. It seriously looks like it could break if bumped the wrong way. Luckily, every time I used it it was guarded and or supported by other equipment. The cable works great, I just feel the minijack portion could be a bit stronger."
5,"Monster Cable, Monster product quality",Great item. works perfectly connecting my Intel mac mini to my 5.1 surround sound Yamaha receiver.
4,Sturdy and capable,I wanted a cable to connect from my computer to my Bose system. This does the job admirably.
2,"Great, but...","My friend has this cord to connect his iPod to his stereo, and it works great, great sound, good ease of use etc. I wanted one so I went to Bestbuy today and got one by RCA that sounds just as good for $7.99."
1,waste of money,Completely agree with Lee. As it is the 8800 is a slow camera. Adding the strange contraption makes it almost useless in all except very bright conditions.Skip this product and save up for a new camera instead.
1,A Total Rip-Off!!!!,"Do not be deceived by Monster Cable's fancy looking cables and exotic looking packaging.Inside this thick ""Garden Hose"" cable,is nothing more than the basic copper wire you will find in a 1/8 mini-stereo cable that costs $1.99.Unfortunately,I did buy this cable,used it,but could not return it.This cable is almost as heavy as my speakers!! I now use a basic $1.99 mini cable from my sound card to my speakers and it works great!!"
1,Save Yourself the Frustration,"Worked swell for a few days...then just died. Called customer service, got voicemail during the hours they said they were open, left a message, never received a return call. Called again in 4 days, voice mail again, again no return call. Called a third time, finally got through. Asked me if I dropped it in the water! No, just used it, took it off, set it down and then it wouldn't work again. CS told me that the battery terminals get dirty (after a few days?) so I should remove and reseat the battery. Did that, came back to life....but now the headset won't go into pairing mode....Overall, not work the hassle."
2,"Poor Comfort, Not Much Bass","These phones work well for me- easy bluetooth connectivity, pretty much noise free, acceptable sound.However they are very uncomfortable with either provided earpiece cover. The foldable plastic behind the head band is annoying and painful. Bass is lacking, too."
2,Not worth the money.,"The connection between the included sender and the headphones is not great. The sound quality and volume is quite low. Also the build quality of the items is not very good either. I have had other inexpensive bluetooth headphones that were much better. I have not paired with a phone or mp3 player, only the included audio sender."
5,The best Bluetooth stereo headset,This device is simply great the audio streamer is something I didn't expect I use this with my ARchos 5 and the sound quality is goodSometime I use it with my Xperia X1 and is perfect the 12 hrs of battery and the extract one that it bring (for the audio streamer) is just awesome. I recommend this to anyone that knows how to use stereo headset and for those individual that want their life to be wireless
2,"Good sound, lacking features","I got a pair of these a while back, and although the sound quality is very good, there are several serious problems with this headset.1. The microphone goes in the same slot as the USB for charging. Many times I've picked up my headset, and wondering why the caller can't hear me, just to realize I forgot to plug the microphone back.2. Battery life time has gone downhill, and fast. It's at the point now (in less than 1 year) that I need to try to replace this battery, but I have no idea where to find this battery...3. I switched to an iPhone a few months ago, and although it works with the iPhone, the pairing has to be done every time. What's worse, it can lose the pairing arbitrarily it seems. I don't know if this is an iPhone issue, but the Motorola HT820 that my wife uses does not have this problem.In the end, I can't recommend this headset. I just placed an order for the Motorola HT820 instead, even though it's sound quality is not as good as the BlueAnt X5's."
3,Not bad,"I think Bluetooth headsets have a has a long way to grow before becoming a real high quality stereo option. The stereo quality when paired to a HTC P-3600 or I-Mate Jamin is poor, sound is distorted and lacks of higher frequencies, if you want to used it paired to your mobile device for music you will be disappointed.When Paired to the supplied streamer sound is much better but is not great.Pros: Wireless, Lightweight, Removable batteries, Streamer included, accessories.Cons: Poor stereo sound, tends to tire your hears after 30+ minutes of playing."
3,"Bad Luck, defective down volume button","I got this unit today and after checking all the functions I found out that the down volume does not work, I am right now outside of the US and claiming for a warranty return will be more expensive than trashing it.I guess the unit has problems with the design of the push button controllers, the ON button on the handset must be press really hard to work. Be sure before you order one of these bluetooth toys that your systems are compatible with the A2DP technology, otherwise you will be very dissapointed."
2,Poor Audio,"Everyone I talk to (on my Motorola RAZR cellphone) complains that they either can't hear me clearly or else I sound like I am ""talking inside a barrel."" I can hear them clearly, but outgoing audio is obviously unsatisfactory.The neck band is quite a bit too small too. The earpieces barely reach my ears when wrapped around my neck from the back (the only way it can be used).This one is headed for the junk drawer along with a few other bad choices I've made that are already there. I've kept it too long 'hoping something would get better' so it's too late to return it."
2,"Purchased 2 X5's. 1 worked for a year, the other for 2 months.","BlueAnt no longer sells or supports the X5 or any other stereo headset. All information about this product simply disappeared from their website.My 1st X5 worked well for just over a year, then the audio streamer simply stopped lighting up. Replacing the battery did not solve the problem.I misplaced my receipt, so I was unable to use the warranty.Since I liked the set well enough, I purchased a 2nd X5. After 2 months the headset and the audio streamer no longer recognize each other. The lights on both devices indicate that they are in pairing mode, but they do not pair. I swapped parts with my older X5, to no avail.I have triggered the warranty and will follow up here with information about how that process goes."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,I use these headphones at the gym and don't have to fumble with wires! It answers the phone when a call comes in and goes back to playing music when the call is hung up. The stereo quality is really good. I wanted the style over earbuds so I didn't have to worry about them falling out with vigerous activity. I have had them several years now and I am still very pleased.
4,Great Product,"After a month, I've had no problems with the X5.If you've never worn this type of headset before (behind the head), it may take a few days of discomfort before getting accustom to them (after that, you hardly notice them).The sound quality is great, the battery life is excellent, and included accessories make this a great buy."
2,Bluetooth vs. Sound Quality,This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise. The Bluetooth capability and comfort are the two best things about this product. The sound quality is very poor for listening to music through my iPod and I am very disappointed by them. There is absolutely no bass and the treble sounds very poor to me also. I will never purchase headphones like this again.
2,Whos head fits these?,"As far as a bluetooth connected headphone, they are about what is to be expected. But, my main question is.........who's head do these fit? My son is only 12 and they wouldn't fit his head. We tried them on every boy in my son's Boy Scout troop, they didn't fit anyone! They wouldn't reach contact with the ears of any boy, even an 11 year old, little on an adult. No adjustability built into the headgear. Not possible to disconnect the ear pieces and wear them seperately."
3,Product is not bad,"All in all not a bad product. Sound quality and volume is pretty good. Did not like buttons due to them being so easily set off while transporting them (gym bag, jacket pocket) killing battery as well as the battery life not being that great to begin with. The foldaway feature is good although now after using them for about a month the joints are really flimsy. Also the blue tooth audio adapter could be a little smaller. I expected a little more for the price I paid ($100)."
1,Don't waste your time!,"Set worked great for 2 weeks. Then one day, I went to use them and the reciever crapped out. Windows did not recognize this usb device! ...Is what my computer said...I don't have time to be shipping things back and fourth, I'd like my purchases to last when I buy them. I thought for $100 I would be happy with my purchase.Guess not... :("
3,The headset works fine if your in a conversation but don't buy these for music.,I bought these mostly to listen to music at work and liked the idea of being wireless. After following all of the steps to make sure they were fully charged and paired with my phone (Nexus One running Android 2.2.1) the music quality was horrible. I had a co worker who uses a generic set of ear buds try these out and told me there is constant static in the audio. Amazon was great with returning these and getting a refund. I guess I need to stick to wired headphones. I didn't give it 1 star since I never tried out the quality of a phone call.
3,Very good bluetooth product,"Very good bluetooth product. The headphones work well with two other bluetooth items on my HP HDX laptop. It will connect directly to the laptop, however to get stereo sound, you have to use the add-on piece that plugs into the headphone jack of the computer. The headphones aren't as comfortable as I'd like them to be. After about an hour and a half of wear, they become uncomfortable, even irritating. Takes a little getting used to. I probably would by this product again, but not at the price listed."
2,"Short lived, a disappointment.",The BlueAnt X5 Bluetooth Stereo Headset sounded pretty good using Skype. My contacts said the headset sounded great to them. But after about 10 days the audio from iTunes and Skype started to sound gravely and not as loud as when I first installed. The Blue Tooth link is simple and the unit relinks to the phone or the streamer very easily and quickly when switching.Update: The distorted audio has gotten worse over the last few days and I have stopped using the X5 and have bought another brand of wireless headset.
3,"Good sound, poor everything else","I have owned this headset since Nov '07. Since then I have come to some realizations about this headset. First off, the sound is good. I does a great job as a wireless headset, and stays put while jogging.Now the bad. To start, none of the buttons on it seem to work. I cannot even power it down, since once it is turned on, the power switch is non-functional, which means I must remove the battery to turn it off. Neither the connect, nor the volume buttons work either. This is unfortunate, because the ROKR I use has a rather pathetic volume control and without the headset working, I cannot seem to find a sweet spot. Also, the headset gets rather uncomfortable after wearing them for any length of time. And finally, I have been told I sound as though I am talking softly when I use this set for conversations.I cannot say I can recommend this headset for anyone other than maybe joggers that want to use their phone as their mp3 player while out for a run..."
4,"good, but...","The headphones were easy to pair to the streamer. The only thing to mote is that the headphones must be switched off before you put them in pairing mode. Sound quality is great for listening to music, and skype seems to work fine with them. My only gripe is the delay in sound reaching my ears, which is long enough to make the headphones impractical for watching movies."
3,Good for beginners,"Great packadging, great shipping, awful item.Nobody can hear anything I say through the detachable microphone. There is horrible feedback when charging the bluetooth airport. But nice when they are fully charged and when not using the mike."
2,Battary is everything,Overall a nice idea but in reality the short life time of the battery is very annoying... because of all the recharging (the headset as well as the bluetooth station) I am currently using more often my old wired ones. The quality of the sound is also bad if you are using the system with a microphone for skype or your cell phone.
1,Built cheap...battery door is tiny spring w/cheap clip,This product is waiting to break.I just received unit and battery won't stay clipped into earpiece. I examined it and it is el-cheapo 2-coil spring with chinzy plastic clip to hold battery in place...in theory...but it doesn't and battery keeps popping out.Spring/clip is built so cheaply...I have to return these. Will check out newer Motorola unit. This one stinks.
5,Great-got more Carmen on Warner Bros.?,"This album is from the later side of Carmen McRae. All the songs are jazz-like, and she sings the songs lavishingly with John Clayton's orchestra. Jazz fans, get this NOW!"
3,"Great toy, poor quality.",My son got this toy for Christmas and loved it. He loves the the recorded message and I thought it was great that we could create the message. The only problem is that the toy broke within one month. First the buttons would work sporadically and then just stopped working altogether. He was not excessively rough with the toy. He has another phone (different brand) that is still working well and has really taken a beating.
4,Wonderful toy,"I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. This is a fabulous toy. My two sisters have this toy for their kids and it is a big hit. I've also given it as a gift to several friends for their one-year-olds. It's great because Mommy and Daddy can talk into the phone, and the kids just love to press the button and hear their voices coming from the phone--over and over again! Our phones have not broken, either. The voice quality isn't superb, but it's good enough, and it's great for the kiddos to pretend to chat on the phone like Mom. We love it."
2,Broke in 2 days,"My 14 mos old son got this for xmas and LOVED it for the less than 48 hours that it worked :(. Great idea, poor quality. Just too bad, because it actually fooled him away from our real phones. Too much money for a shoddy product. Toddler stuff needs to be able to withstand a few tumbles."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!,This phone lasted for about one month. The voice quality is bad and it now does not work at all.It is junk!
1,Stay away from this product,"The product worked great for 2 hours & then turned into a piece of junk. It isn't durable at all, don't buy it unless you like to throw your money away. Plus the voice recording quality isn't very good at all."
2,self recording feature,All features of the HelloPhone are well designed and operational except the self-recording feature which is abysmally inadequate. The sound quality is Extremely poor and sound level faint...totally unusable for the intended small child to hear or enjoy.
1,Horrible build quality,"This toy is fun, when it works. My child has been through 2 in just a few months (both given as gifts). The first broke almost immediately. It completely stopped working in just a few days, and my child was not hard on it at all. The second one has done a little better - it mostly works, but the record function broke right away. It also eats batteries for lunch. Overall, a waste of money."
2,A Disappointing Evening,"I had expected commentary on the background of the songs as was in the wonderful""An Evening with Dorothy Fields"". This was straight singing with an unappealing choice of songs, especially the ones from ""Most Happy Fella"". A waste of time and money."
2,Echoes of Space Groove,"2003 original review: The weakest of the ""ProjecKt"" releases, the execution seems speeded up at the wrong times, and too shrill at others, compared to Space Groove, my first exposure to the King Crimson fractals.2005 review update: started listening to it again, would increase to 2.5 stars. Sus-tayn-Z, Deception..., and Live Groove probably the best and most focused. Still hard to digest the ""Constructions"" (tracks 2, 5 and 7), and the other comments above still hold."
2,Decorating Baskets,"This book should be called flower arranging. I expected reed decorations on baskets--what it is, is arranging things IN baskets."
4,creepy,"This is a very effective horror movie that relies on shocks and thrills rather than grossing you out. Some thieves pull off a major heist, escape in an airplane, and parachute into a cornfield, where they are terrorized by possessed scarecrows. The movie was well made and excellent. I really liked it."
2,bored,"not as good as i remembered,poor acting not eough goin on.AS A SLASHER FLICK,THERES NOTHING LIKE THE BURNING/AND MANIAC!"
5,jetcitywoman,"I would like to know who is really writing these one star reviews!?!?!? This movie really is an 80's classic horror movie!! This is coming from someone who had their wits scared out of them from watching ""Poltergeist"" for the first time in the dark, and can now look back and cannot believe that it is only rated PG! However, I am still a horror movie buff, and has eaten spaghetti through Pinhead and Hostel, and laughs at the fact that Jigsaw couldn't catch Tom Cruise in ""The Firm"" LOL. But that aside, come on folks one star.... I am going to push you into the light!!!"
2,We Sure As Heck Ain't In Oz Anymore,"Gory, unpleasant and downright nasty, but on the downside the whole film feels like it's missing something, this could have been a ripsnorter of a horror film but it's just too lacklustre to pull it off.Night Of The Scarecrow (1995) was a better effort I thought, I wish that was out on DVD.The 2 stars are for the gore and spooky settings."
2,Scarecrows is a near 'miss' with few scares,"I purchased this movie from Amazon after reading all the good reviews. I would give 'Scarecrows' a 2 star rating and I think that is being generous. The acting is absolutely the worst, there is way too much cursing and to be honest, the demon scarecrows are not very impressive. On the plus side, the DVD picture was crisp. I was impressed being the movie takes place entirely over one night. Too bad the makers weren't able to deliver on a decent storyline. In fact, I recognized some themes in Scarecrows present in more contemporary Horror films (such as the scarecrows duplicating the voices of the robbers and the vines from 'The Ruins'). Several of the reviews complained about the pacing of the movie. I don't think the movie suffers from this at all. 'Scarecrows' is a near miss."
4,I forgot how utterly screwed up this movie was......and THATS A GOOD THING!,"I had copied this years and years ago on VHS so I basically put it on my shelf and let it collect dust and was pleasantly surprised when I found it had been released on DVD.I was even more surprised when I put it in my machine and sat down and watched this sucker and realized how utterly twisted and sick and gory it is.......and these are THE GOOD POINTS, there are hardly any bad points to this movie, straight up, it is an 80's horror flick that deserved it's DVD status.It is rather slow going in the beginning but once it gets rolling, it never stops till the end."
1,haven't watched it,I ordered this movie for a friend in another State. I haven't watched the movie. It is inappropriate for me to review it.
3,Super cheese topped with thick creamy atmosphere!,"Horror fans, there is not much more that I can say about this one...my review title says it all. It is a very cheesey film with spurts of seriously creepy moments as well as a half decent amount of gore. It's not an easy film to find so I'd suggest that you definitely add it to your collection if you can get your hands on it, especially if your a child of the 80's."
3,Not too bad...not so great,"It's certainly not horrible, but it sure is light on the gore. It's pretty much just a bunch of guys and a couple girls trompin around a cornfield, being attacked by 'living' scarecrows. There are a couple of good FX scenes, but not enough for as much time as we spend watching them walk the rows. The retrospective on this film, in the lastest Fangoria, is better than the movie."
1,Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad,"Sooooooooooo pointless and boring. I wound up fast forwarding just to see the kills after 30 minutes of aimless wandering around and utterly ridiculous dialogue between the characters. I am not even going to go on about what the film is about, just that it was so extremely boring and uneventful that I wish I wouldn't have spent ten bucks to buy it because of the rave reviews."
3,Not the Fuse Puller I Ordered,"The fuse puller I ordered was nothing as the picture described. The picture showed a 2 Prong Fuse Puller, and I received a 1 prong miniature fuse puller. It still will work fine for the applications I would use it for, being small fuses in electrical panels and what not. The one I received is also not non-slip. I really wish I got what I ordered in the picture, but I will be fine with what I have I guess. I ordered from Techni-Tool by the way."
1,"The album entitled 'Everyday"" NOT what it seems!","Regardless of the album cover which depicts a picture of James Taylor as well as his name, this is NOT James Taylor. It doesn't even appear that he sings on any of the songs, although the back of the cover does give him credit for his work. It gives no indication of who is actually recording the album. This was produced by a German company and labeled LT Series. If you want JT, DON'T buy this album. If you just like his music and can't afford the original, go for it but be warned! Amazon - you dhould really examine your products before you list them. This was incredibly deceitful and definitely false advertising. The description should be clearly labeled that this is NOT James Taylor. Shame on you!"
2,I wouldn't know how it works.,"The capsules are made of gelatin, which was not listed in the product description. If you are kosher or veg*an this product is not for you."
1,Gelatin Capsule,The capsules are made of gelatin even though it doesn't list it as that way. I had to return them. Disappointed.
5,Makes an amazing difference for me!,"I was introduced to this product by my chiropractor/alternative med. Dr. Through saliva testing it was determined that I was in adrenal distress assumed to be due to many external stressors in my life. I was having trouble concentrating & sleeping, experienced weight gain, depression among other symptoms. It took only about 3 days to see an incredible improvement in my overall well being. Very soon many of my symptoms lessend or disappeared completely. My family also uses Seriphos and we all agree that we are all sleeping better, wake up refreshed and are less moody. My 12 year old son sees a difference in his ability to concentrate in school when he is taking Seriphos."
1,"May have hurt, did not help","I took Seriphos for eight days, primarily to lower cortisol levels and promote sound sleep. I did not test cortisol but found that my nighttime awakenings got worse with Seriphos. The label warns about ""mild insomnia."" I tried different dosing strategies.My integrative medicine physician advised me to try it but after the week on it told me to stop.It was a somewhat expensive trial: about $26 with shipping from Amazon."
4,good product,This is helpful for sleep problems due to elevated cortisol. I take it every night and have more consistent sleep.
5,Seriphos is GREAT !,"My alternative wellness physician suggested this product and does it work for me. I take one or two pills when I go to bed and if I wake up in the middle of the night and feel I cant go back to sleep, I take another one and I fall back to sleep instantly. I also feel I am mentally crisper from taking these.My dad has always had sleep issues and these work for him.Very pleased with this product. I will never let these run out.D"
2,MAY NOT BE REMEDY FOR INSOMINA,"This product was recommended by a pharmacist who is also a natural health consultant. I took the recommended dosage before bed and had a terrible, restless night--a pattern of sleep that was altogether different from my ususal form of insomnia. After re-reading some of the reviews that suggested taking Seriphos during the day (well before bedtime), I tried that as well, but had the same type of disrupted sleep. The reviews indicate that this product may not work for everyone, but anything is worth a try when you are experiencing chronic insomnia."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"It may look nice but it is junk - the doors are warped, the screw holes were either too big or too small and after 6 hours or more of putting it together it was a huge disappointment. One side is warped and trying to put it together the cams bent, several of the boards were cut too small and all that holds them together is glue. There is over 250 pcs in the box, we are experienced at putting things together and this was a nightmare. It is poorly cut, poorly built and not worth the effort it takes to put it together."
2,a bunch of depressed artists,"I was disappointed with this book. I was expecting more inside studio shots, with details of how the artistswork. Instead I got photos of really depressed looking artists that did not look like they enjoyed their work.I would not recommend this book as a source of inspiration for anyone."
2,"interesting people, poor production","It was really great to listen to writers in the business, but the host was not a great speaker and the production quality was bad."
2,Just a Beginner's Book,"This book gives a concise summary of elementary data modeling concepts that can be found in practically any textbook on the subject. It may do for a beginner in a hurry, but for someone at all familiar with the topic, it simply rehashes very, very familiar material.In fact, I could have titled this review ""The One-Idea Book,"" because the only original (?) idea I found was the suggestion to implement optional 1-to-many relationships by using a composite table."
1,Nothing to it and outdated,"Well the book is certainly short - I finished scanning it over a weekend. By the first hour I realized that I didn't really want to read it carefully.Overall the book reads like it was designed as an undergraduate text book -- an academic view of data model with little of use to a professional.Most of the treatment is very outdated. The E-R diagrams are like nothing modern I've seen and the book apparently is pre-UML.I guess if you need a very basic introduction, this book might be useful, otherwise, stay away."
5,morrissey did it again!,"As a tired consumer of buying re-packaged songs, this cd is not bad at all. ""Pashernate Love"" is perhaps the best song. Hard to find B sides will flourish your stereo at home or work or play. Added bonus if you have a computer and a true Morrissey fan, you even get a freebee video for the song ""Sunny"". Bottom line, it is a good compilation of Moz' B side songs in one family fun packed cd. Hurray for Moz. Let it rip!"
3,Funny discovery of a bit of Morrissey plagarism,"Just now listening to the fabulous collection ""One Kiss Leads to Another,"" an anthology of 1960s Girl Group pop, and The Cookies' ""Only To Other People"" came on, and I instantly recognized the tune, but not the lyrics. Turns out the chords and melody of the song were lifted by Morrissey and/or Andy Rourke and given new lyrics. Moz fans know the song as ""Girl Least Likely To,"" a b-side collected on this anthology."
4,MY EARLY BURGLARY YEARS : a solid compilation,"there is nothing new here to Morrisey fans (besidesd a newly recorded live version of ""Cosmic Dancer"", but overall this is a great collection of songs that showcases his fine voice and lyrical talent. ""Swallow On My Neck"" has always been an underrated gem of a song. the same applies to ""Boxers"" and the live version of ""Jack The Ripper"" which never fails to send shivers up my spine whenever it's played."
3,GET PRODUCTION ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW!,"The court judgement against Morrissey in London must have really hit his pocketbook hard. Otherwise, why would he be making his records on a Fostex four track with only one mike hanging from the ceiling? It may have worked well for Jerry Lee Lewis at Sun Studios but it unquestionably does not here. While some of the B-sides featured on this uneven complilation are charming, most of the EQ and production work make them almost unlistenable. It's strange, because Morrissey has had beautiful results in the past. These cuts, though, sound sloppy and muddy. It's time for this artist to quit being a lazy sod and get back to work. He can foist this material on his legions of hangers on for only so long before they sense that the hogs are simply getting slopped."
2,Mozzer's melodious and melancholic mediocrity,"What? Another compilation of previously released material? It seems that the public can't seem to get enough of Morrissey. ""My Early Burglary Years"" contains many familiar Mozzer B-sides, and some of these tracks (such as ""Sister I'm A Poet"" and ""Cosmic Dancer"") only partially redeem this otherwise bland effort. Where is the Morrissey of old? Where is the erudite (and original) angst found in his former CDs, like ""Viva Hate"" and ""Vauxhall & I""? If he plans to release more mediocrity, then Moz will find that one day, the world won't listen."
3,why don't you find out for yourself?,"I'm not sure if I actually like this album or if it's just barely a step ahead of the last three pieces of deer droppings Morrissey has released. Having endured Maladjusted, this seems like an epic."
4,Brilliant but difficult.,"It's the story of a week in the life of unemployed, aspiring writer, Tom Clay who is living in the Gorbals slums of Glasgow as they are being torn down in the 60's. His pregnant wife is in hospital. He has a one-night stand with a woman whose husband he fears is seeking revenge on him. His wife's family keep nagging him to get a job and a hair cut. It doesn't have much plot although it's full of incidents and digressions. Clay is involved in various strategies to get money. He has intellectual interests and may be writing.The main attraction is the quality of the writing. This is witty and erudite but prolix, and demands close attention. The humor, although often ingenious, becomes somewhat repetitious by the end. The plumbing of the Gorbals was very primitive and this gives rise to recurrent scatological themes."
1,Sam Tsoutsouvas (Narrator),"There is no imitation for Tom Peters. Having someone else read his book out loud is like someone reading Maya Angelo's peotry - flat, uninspired, and ineffective."
3,Refers to audio version,"Great books. On the audio, however, I miss""Chairman"" Tom's almost manaical ranting (sometimes I listento his audiotapes wondering how close he came to cardiac arrest during recording because of passionate ""overexhortion"".) While I am sure the reader is an accomplished actor/narrator -- hearing the words ""dude"" ""dudette"" pronounced in a Shakespearian tone just loses something for me."
3,"Effective and secure, but not very portable","I was looking for a laptop lock that I could throw into my laptop bag and take with me wherever I need to secure my MacBook Pro (e.g. coffee shops). This more than does the job--I certainly don't worry about theft when it's in place--but it's longer, heavier and more awkward than necessary for my purposes.I would recommend this laptop lock for stationary uses (securing a laptop to a desk, for instance), but not to someone looking for security on the go."
4,Works great,The lock works great for my macbook pro. Simple and easy to use as advertised. Only downside is that you can't reset the passcode to something you want.
3,"Great Lock, I wish I could set the combination.","I didn't realize when I purchased this lock that it didn't have the ability to customize the combination. We have purchased Targus DEFCON locks in the past with this feature and are spoiled by it. I recommend the brand, the quality is great. I just wish it had been made a bit more clear that there was another option with this feature."
5,"Buy it, good lock","What you see is what you get. This lock fits all standard lock receivers on monitors, desktops, thin clients, televisions, printers, etc. The thickness of the cable is perfect for sending the casual theif along their way though small bolt cutters will not be held back. It comes with a variety of trim colors which is great for keeping the combinations straight. Highly recommended for anyone needing a simple lock."
2,Good but can not change the key,I bought it and later I discovered that I can not change the key. Good product but bad info about that it can not be changed.
1,"terrible design, stopped working upon first use","This lock is poorly designed. Upon setting a new combination code and attempting to plug into my laptop, found it very hard to turn dials away from my code to engage the lock. Once removed from laptop, the lock somehow reset in the locked position and my code would no longer work. Followed all the directions. Also the lock is quite wobbly on the computer, even with the supplied spacers. Buy the Kensington keyed lock instead; you won't regret it."
1,DOES NOT PREVENT THEFT!,"I purchased this lock to, obviously, protect my laptop against theft. Unfortunately, this lock failed! My laptop was locked and chained to my desk but the thieves were able to rip the lock right out of my laptop! I found the lock, still chained to my desk, with black plastic bits from my laptop around the locking mechanism. The actual laptop was long gone.I called Targus to inform them of their faulty product and they said it was only a ""theft deterrent"" and did not prevent against actual theft. They provide no warranty whatsoever for the lock itself or the stolen products.This lock is a horrible product and DOES NOT PREVENT AGAINST THEFT. DO NOT PURCHASE."
2,Drew Carey Show,"Well, thier are a lot better episodes out there. Like any involving Michael Gross from Family Ties and his alcholic wife. The only two that shone at all were the 4 and 5 episodes with Adrienne Barbou, not due to her, she just happened to be in them.There are 6 episodes, and the first three are kind of stinkers,4 and 5 are good, and episode 6 is a special effects goofy deal.The DVD reflects poorly on a hilarious series.Im kind to give it a 2, and it pains me, because the show was one of the greatest ever."
4,The Drew Cary Show Was One Of My Favorites,"The first season or two of the Drew Carey show her my absolute favorite series at the time. The show is very entertaining and I especially love Drew fighting with Mimi all the time. The other characters were also great matters really sorry to see Lisa go in the first season; I always thought she was hot.What you get with this disc is a handful of episodes which seem to be mainly picked out because they had some sort of uniqueness. For example you have the first episode, you also have the wonderful music video that they did, one that had an animated Daffy duck, and the one where they go to drug Co. to rescue Drew's dog. It's a nice little sampler plate for the whole series.If you can't get the individual seasons separately, this is about the best you can do."
4,From Simply Dreams,"""This story was gripping. Not only did Ms. Curry weave a good tale, but she delivered the punch as well! This is not a story you'll be disappointed with at the end. Except maybe that it's over! I read Angel Wings through in one sitting. I was captivated by the blooming love and hope engrossed in the characters. Susie is precious and lovingly real. Good job Ms. Curry!""4 stars from Simply Dreams"
1,Cables don't meet RJ11 Specs,"I bought these cables and they look real nice, unfortunately the RJ-11 Connectors on them have a flaw that makes them hard to get out of the RJ-11 Socket a small file on the two latching tabs will round the edges making removal much easier. Hope this helps anyone who has bought these cables after smooting our the latch the cables work great."
2,No difference.....,I ran a cnet.com speed test before installing this and another test after installing. Absolutely NO difference in my Windstream DSL speed. Zippo.....I needed a longer line since I moved my desktop to a new armoire just short of the cable that Windstream installed with the router/modem combo.High speed??? Not for me.....Keep the cheap phone cord the DSL company gave you and save the money.
5,You can start immediately in programming Java!,"Very direct approach to OO programming in general and Java specifically. Many examples showed to the reader with a gradual approach. And, last but not least, a little amusing due to a story of elephants in the background..."
3,Good for real Beginners,"Are you new to OOPs? this is the book for you. Are you an advanced user looking to sharpen your code design skills? Look for something else. This book is ""too wordy"" (as someone else said above). Though it helps in driving the point home, it gets boring after a while. It is good if you want to learn all OOP jargon and some basic concepts.In 3 words...I like it but I don't think it is good enough to be priced at anything over $15."
1,Wordy and Boring!,"I agree with one of the reviewers who wrote that the book is wordy and it does not worth over [money]. Only one-third of the book is educational, the rest is junk. The author wants to be funny and all that does is to make me irritated at all the jokes and the pizza and the elephant stories. If I want to learn how to do something, I'll look to the instructions in a manual, not some ""comic book want-to-be"". I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Stay away from this book,"Too much junk and the way this book is organized makes it not easy to understand. I agree with a previous reviewer that this books it too wordy and boring.For a book on java, I'd recommend ""Java in 21 days"" and ""Thinking in Java""."
3,Too hard!,The book goes on and on about a particular topic and never stops.....enough already....I got it!
4,explains concepts well,"I have just finished a semester of Java in college but I wanted a book to help clarify the concepts I've learned for review over the summer and so that what I learned would sink in further. I also wanted to learn TRUE Java code (1.1 as opposed to Microsoft's VJ++). I've only read the first few chapters and yet I found this book to be helpful so far. This is the first programming language I have learned and so there were things I learned that were still fuzzy and this book is, chapter by chapter, step by step, clarifying those concepts. Thanks."
1,Wouldn't recommend...,"Although this book can be of use, it is extremely wordy and often lacks logical sequence of material presentation. Reading and trying to follow it can be frustrating."
5,"Funny, smart and well written","I stumbled upon Coupling one night by accident. It was very funny. The episode was not the first but it isn't necessary to watch from the first episode. It enhances the comedy, once you know the characters personalities. Great show I would recommend it to anyone. It is British (I typically don't like British humor), but travels well. It is just funny."
5,HILARIOUS!,"After watching one episode at a friend's house, I came home and immediately ordered the complete series. Every episode is a hoot!"
5,SOOO Funny,"It's ""Friends"" with a kick- My husband and i have watched every episode so many times that I practically know the lines by heart. You won't regret buying it! Don't lend the dvds to your friends however, or you might never get them back."
5,Up There With The Best Of Em =),Up There With The Best Of Em =)Im not gonna write a long review but i adore this series. It has the perfect cast and any Pirates of the Caribbean movie fan will no doubt enjoy seeing Jack Davenport in a completely new light. I wish this series lasted longer then 4 seasons and i wish each season was more then 5 episodes.
5,"Coupling, Season 1-4, BBC America Sexy Comedy","Six singles, 3 men and 3 women, all with quirky personality traits attempt to discover the the meaning of life and sex. Each episode, filled with sexy suggestive humor kept us laughing.I attempted to purchase this on e-Bay, but didn't trust the cheap ""China"" produced versions, and couldn't purchase at a better price than Amazon's, especially since shipping on Amazon was free. Quick delivery. Very satisfactory all around."
5,Nothing funnier,"After watching ""Coupling"" for years on PBS I finally own it as of yesterday. I watched all 6 season 1 episodes immediately when I got home. After all this time it still makes me laugh my ass off!!! I've actually laughed so hard it HURT. Never has or series BBC or U.S. been so funny it hurt and brought tears to my eyes. If you like naughty comedy (not TOO naughty btw) you have to see this."
5,COUPLING,"The first 3 seasons of Coupling to me is all of the below and more...C - ComicalO - OutrageousU - UnadulteratedP - PerkyL - LovableI - InterestingN - NeuroticG - GreatI would give it 10 stars, if I could! However, season 4 is bad in comparison but the first 3 seasons more than make up for season 4's flaws."
4,Hilarious sitcom-clever writing,"This British sitcom has clever writing, great cast and is overall hilarious. It is a similar setup as Friends, but much funnier and more original."
4,hilarious adult comedy,"Seasons 1, 2, and 3 are wonderful.Jeff Murdoch (patrick coyle) breaks me up with his off-the wall commentary.Season 4, without Jeff, is not nearly so funny.We will watch this until the cd's wear out and then buy another set."
5,Coupling,"If you like British humor, you're bound to like this set. It captures the dry wit and hilarious perversion that is British comedy. I watch the entire series every six months or so, it never gets old."
4,When will season 5 be made?,"Coupling would be a cross between ""Sex and the City"" and ""Friends"" but in the British style. The British style of comedy focuses more on character acting and real situation comedy i.e. exaggeration of reality then the one liners of their American counter-parts. However their is always one problem with relying to heavily on character flaws and that is it becomes stale (predictable) and the series relies heavily on plot for the situation comedy to develop. Fawlty Towers is reminiscent of this problem and I believe did the honorable thing by running finite episodes. With that said the Writer (only one!) does an amazing job, and with adding bit actors, continuinug with creative plots, flash backs, etc does a marvellous job of keeping the series fresh and funny. I highly recommend the series to anyone who wants to see a sit-com done differently - you won't be disappointed."
5,Everything I wanted except subtitles...,"Ever since I saw my first episode of Coupling on TV I was hooked. This boxed set is great. I even discovered that there were 2 episodes I never saw before, when I thought I'd seen them all. The only drawback is the lack of subtitles. It's a BBC show and I'm American, and I can't always catch what they are saying. Overall, it's worth the money in my opinion."
5,One of BBC's best,"I got hooked into this show one late night watching BBC television. My tivo got so sick of taping it that I couldn't help just buy the whole series. Unfortunately it didn't have the same life of as ""Friends"" here in the US otherwise I would have bought another 6 more seasons of it. There's not too many episodes each season however the bonus is each episode is 30 mins. long since BBC doesn't have commercial breaks. I would recommend this to those who liked Friends but just wished there was even more sexual content."
3,kind of funny.....,"Out of all of them, you really root for at least some of these people to find true love. despite all the adult jokes and all, you really end up cheering that at least a few of them find true love and in the end a few of them do."
2,Mediocre At Best,"I kept waiting and waiting for this book to get better. It was billed as ""humorous"" in it's review and I did not find one thing funny about this book. I was really disappointed. I have a policy of always reading a book from beginning to end just on the chance that it may start off slow and then get better. This book never did. I wish I had stopped reading it. I also bought ""Heathens"" and I am thinking about returning it.This is definitely not a book I would recommend."
2,Mediocre at Best,"Based on the synopsis on this book, I really expected it to be a funny, thoroughly enjoyable book. I kept waiting and waiting for it to get better. I have a policy to read a book to completion after starting it so I felt like I had to finish this book but I found it to be pretty painful. I really did not like this book. I bought ""Heathens"" which is also by this author and I am seriously considering returning it and getting my money back. I was very disappointed.This isn't one I would recommend."
4,fascinating,"I've never read an anthology with such a narrow topic before. Despite that, I was pleased with how incredibly different the stories were. Having survived three pregnancies myself, I was also pleased the stories captured so much of the emotion and energy surrounding the hoopla that is pre-conception all the way through birth. So big question... when do we get to see ""After: Short Stories About Raising Babies From Our Top Writers"" ??? Now THERE is some wild and wooly raw material!"
3,Middle of the road novel about family obcessions,"Warren Adler's ""Blood Ties"" is about a family of aristocrats that are masters of the arms trade that have their annual reunion just before the patriach dies from his heart condition. The Von Kessels are obcessed with blood, and see no reason for ethical reservations, but the son who is favored to take over the empire believes that nuclear weapons are too terrible and awesome not to have reservations about. While Albert von Kessel struggles with his dilemma, a mysterious woman comes to Aunt Karla, and threatens to reveal a secret that would change everything. And the Russian widow of a long-lost prodigal uncle comes to the gathering, but under suspiction of being a spy. This does capture the late 70's well, but I felt that the end was too rushed and the action was rather dull. For this, I will say it is quite average."
5,Picks up where Walter The Farting Dog left off.,"Unlike other fart books (and there are quite a few), which are mostly filled with dry facts and anecdotes, The Zen of Farting is full of allegory and a unique brand of wisdom. Definitely a *cut above* the *other* F books..."
3,Super Reader,"Probably needs to be longer, something A.E. was obviously pretty allergic to. A super powered individual, via your classic technology accident, becomes involved in a conspiracy, and time travel. Somewhat of a pulp feel, here. How is his wife involved, how is the corporate world involved?Can he defeat the beastly overlord in the world he is sent to, and protect others?Definitely a superman theme, here."
3,A good description of the different metaphysical phenomena,"Dr. Richard offers a rudimentary introduction to the many different types of metaphysical phenomena, such as the chakras, ESP, clairvoyance, divination, etc. However, the book stops short at just brief description. The title is very misleading; those interested in techniques on how to manifest these types of abilites will be disappointed, for there are none to be found. The book serves well as an introduction and explanation of these abilities, but that is all."
1,P.O.S. can't be your only jigsaw,"I'm a pro carpenter who bought this saw for its scrolling function; which is necessary for certain cuts. But; that is the only time I use this saw, and have had to buy a real (Bosch) jigsaw for every other kind of cut. The orbital mechanism is a hokey little spring that fell apart in under an hour of use. The base plate is ridiculously weak and ineffective. Don't think you're going to make a square cut with this saw; the base plate hopelessly wiggles, and there is no blade support what so ever. Also; the trigger is too big, when you go to pick up this saw your fingers turn it on because the trigger is for three fingers, not one. For the occassional scroll cut it is somewhat usefull, but for anything else it is hopelessly useless!"
3,Forgot the basics,"The Jigsaw feels solid and is comfortable to use. The LED light for illuminating the cutting area is very useful. The mechanism for changing the bevel/angle of cut is frustrating. The locking tab does not securely or fully engage the angle adjustment setting mechanism. The foot adjustment lever that is used to latch this mechanism in place is difficult to use because the tab does not fully engage. Skil forgot the basics: mechanical adjustments on a tool should be simple, accurate and secure."
3,OK - runs a tad small,"ordered the 7 1/2 based on a 7 1/2 U.S.-made boonie purchased locally... these are CHICOM-made ROTHCO boonies, but are decent qualityjust be aware that these will run a tad smaller compared to U.S. hats (mislabeled sizing?)also, the gap between panels in the band is bigger on these 1 3/4 vs 1 1/4 on other booniesall in all, not badfortunately, the ones i received fit, although i'd prefer just a bit looser (may loosen up with use)"
5,100% cotton?,"Bought this for my nephew, great product, looks as good or better quality than GI.appears to be like GI(I'm 30Yr Vet), with 100%? cotton and .05% ripstop nylon threading throughout.fast shipping and good packing. Would buy again."
1,Colors are way off!,I received this item as a gift. I was very disappointed the colors were off when compared to my other ACU items. The lightest green is actually tan on the one I got. Very disappointed!
5,great boonie hat! great price!,"This is a great product. It fits well I wear size 7 1/4, I didnt bother ordering the next size up like the other reviews because in due time it would loosen up after many times of use. I used it for a weekend 10mile hike with a gazzling 15mph wind and a slight sprinkle of rain. Its a great protection against the elements, the strap locks well & my boonie hat didnt get blown once. I saw a similar one on a local sports store and it cost almost 3x more. great product for a great price, another happy amazon purchase"
2,Cheap build,"Hat is sized small.A 7.25 size should be at least 7.75, to fit correctly. Boonies should fit a little loose even after several washings. This won't do it. Hat is stiff and not comfortable. Cost to send back not worth it and they know it."
5,great hat,"works well in multiple situations. keeps head from burning in the sun, but not so hot it makes your head sweat profusely. Also people might think your a GI if you wear it."
3,Shop Around,"Truth be told, these TV specials are awful. Endless jokes about the Captain's hat, hokey musical numbers, B-list guest stars. These shows were actually on network TV? That being said, for a couple bucks per special it's kinda fun to watch how cheesy this stuff was. Buy these for nostalgia purposes only, there's no great music here."
5,Amazing Grace!,"This woman has been around vocally for years, but someone (Quincy Jones) finally signed her up for a debut album. This is a great mix of Gospel, soul and dance. Her voice is solid, smokey and heavenly."
5,I was fascinated and deeply moved,"But then again, I am the author's father! My daughter has a knack for bringing out the sublime beauty inside events full of tragedy. I hope to see a movie one day ..."
2,There are better books about the Genocide,"Honestly, I was extremely disappointed with this book. It seemed more an effort to appear ""artsy"" and ""intellectual"" than to tell a story. If you want a straightforward, accessible story of the Genocide, read ""Zabelle"" by Nancy Krikorian. It has the history, drama, injustice of Genocide without this book's needlessly confusing narrative."
2,"Disappointing ""Armenian"" novel","I have read many survivor's memoirs, and while I understand that this is a novelized compilation of many stories, I am very disappointed in it overall. I am put off by the language used in the novel, which has affected my enjoyment while reading it. Of all the Armenians I know, both friends and relatives, none use this kind of language (swearing and detailed sexual references). I can only suggest that it is the Armenians who were raised in Turkey after the genocide, who were without benefit of Christian upbringing and had only Moslem influence, who may have been this way. Compared to the Armenians I know, it is very BASE language."
2,Product application,The photo on the Target website shows a cable input/output for cable protection. The unit arrived with a phone line input/output-not much help for those expecting protection on their cable line!
3,Cold Cobras,I was disappointed in this book. The P39 and P63 were my favorite fighter planes during WWII. I have been interested in getting more information about combat performance of these planes. It was interesting to read about the experiences of the ferry pilots but not much about the actual flying characteristics of the planes.
2,Pretty disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book when I heard of it and saw the reviews, but I was disappointed. It's very short and had very few examples that I actually found funny. There are much better examples on Google.I wonder if those who rate this book so highly do so because they've never seen real examples of ""Engrish"" or heard of it before? There are so many better examples."
4,Muchly laugh in a happy fashion!,"The Joys of Engrish provides a great look at products with strange english written on them. I didn't stop laughing the entire time I was reading. I would have given five stars, but I wanted the book to be longer! I would recomend this book to anyone with a warped sense of humor."
3,Good Intro to The Genre of Misinterpretation of Translations,"Steven Caires Creator of website Engrish dot com, has put together a collection of photographs of Japanese signage with either deliberate or mistaken Japanese into English translations. Whilst not the best collection of funny translations out there The Joys of Engrish especially for those who have never travelled (or have not got hundreds of these sort of things from their friends as e-mail attachments) will be a good introduction and probably motivate to find the better stuff out there.Many international business or international marketing books out there are full of chapters of these funny advertising campaigns, as well as stories (no stories in this book) of hilarious moments through misinterpretation. The Joys of Engrish is a good introduction to this genre but nothing special."
2,not much for the money,"I love Engrish.com, but the exampres in this book are hardry the best of the bunch.More importantry, and as others have pointed out, it's physicary vely small indeed - perhaps a good varue at $2.99, certainry not more than $3.99.The plice I paid is not a lot of money, but the feeling of having been ""taken"" is unpreasant. Where I had hoped for gut-busting raughter, this turned out to be a disappointment."
1,Dissapointing,"It's not very funny and is very short - almost doesn't feel long enough to be called a book. It's not worth $9. I got it as a gift, but didn't end up giving it because I didn't like it and it seemed like such a cheap gift."
3,HST 1,"The wrong item was shipped to me, but the seller quickly refunded the cost of the book for me. The seller allowed me to keep the textbook sent due to loss of shipping and handling paid."
4,Superfuzz Bigmuff meets Since We've Become Transluscent,"i see this as the transition album between old mudhoney and new mudhoney. half the songs are heavier, thicker, and more like the 1989 mudhoney. the rest of the songs are faster, poppier, like the new.the songs that stood out to me were1) A Thousand Forms of Mind5) Poisoned Water (Which is played live in the Chris Farley/David Spade film ""Black Sheep"")12) Beneath the Valley of the UnderdogI much prefer the older Mudhoney, but I would still recommend this album to someone looking to build their Mudhoney collection, but only after you've bought Superfuzz Bigmuff and EGBDF."
5,Great Music Still Lives,In 1998 when grunge music has been long dead Mudhoney produced what is arguably their best album. From the you-know-it's-a-hit-from-the-first-20 seconds A Thousand Forms of Mind to the equally brilliant Night Of The Hunted and Ghost this album never lets up until brief dead air after Beneath the Valley of the Underdog befor the secret song starts. Mike McCready of Pearl Jam listed this CD as one of his favorite of '98 and it's no wonder why.
1,Don't believe the hype,"I bought this product because it advertised that it can help in reducing cholesterol and regulating your blood pressure. The advertisement says it can also function as a sexual enhancer. Don't believe the hype. So far, after taking this supplement consistently for almost a month, I don't see any improvements in blood pressure. For the reducing cholesterol, I already have a low ""bad"" cholesterol level, and I follow a vegan diet, so the effects on cholesterol are nil. I was surprised when I read that Fo-Ti is used as a sexual enhancer. I don't feel any different on that respect either. It can function as a slow acting energy booster, but if what you need is instant energy boost, then this is not the pill for you. I won't return it, but I won't be buying this again."
5,This album is an absolute gem,"I took a chance on purchasing this cd, and the gamble paid off. It definitely swings! Basie's orchestra is in top form and I can envision Sinatra sipping on some quality booze while belting these songs out in the studio."
3,More from Sinatra and Basie,"The second Frank Sinatra and Count Basie collaboration is not as good as theirfirst one, in my opinion. Sure, it does have a higher percentage of swinging arrangements. But it suffers from a poor selection of material. Songs like ""I Can't Stop Loving You"", ""Hello, Dolly!"" and ""Wives and Lovers"" aren't really appropriate for Sinatra. ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" is particularly bad. Frank doesn't sing country songs as well as his friend Dino. However, there as also some good selections here, such as ""Fly Me To the Moon"" and ""The Best Is Yet To Come"". It's a hit and miss album, but Frank's fans will find something to enjoy here."
2,Borderline Embarrassing,"By the mid-1960's, Sinatra was struggling against the very real prospect of becoming an anachronism (a.k.a., museum piece). In an attempt to stay relevant, contemporary, or hip, he started recording song-hits of Glen Campbell, Ray Charles, The Beatles, Judy Collins, and even Jim Croce. The results were clumsy, awkward, and down-right embarrassing. ""It Might as Well Be Swing"" was the portent of Sinatra's slide into musical floundering. His rendition of Ray Charles' ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" is pathetic. He tried to cash in on Louie Armstrong's runaway hit of ""Hello, Dolly,"" and the result was silly and trivial. He turns ""More"" the theme from Mondo Cane into an inappropriately jazzed-up parody of the original, while ""The Good Life"" is anything but.Too bad Frank didn't go gentle into that good night and be remembered as the nonpareil purveyor of classy, swinging standards."
1,A copy of Simba's Pride,"I myself love the first Balto movie and the Lion King but when I watched this so called movie I saw almost everything the same here is a list of the simalarityies.Simba's Pride (1998) Wolf's Quest (2002Disney universal------------------------------------------------------------------ Main chacter has a daughter- Daughter runs away- Daughter runs away becacuse of father- The part when they say ( We are all part of the grand design) is almost exaclty like the purpuse of ( We are all part of the circle of life)- The ending scene when its raining is ECACLEY like the endding scen when its raining in Simba's Pride.- Kiara dose not want to be a princess, Aleu dose not want to be a wolf.- Over protective father-----------------------------------------------------------------There are MUCH more....but i'd rather never see that movie in my LIFE....there is no ending to it."
1,Yuck,"If you liked the first movie (or even if you didn't) then you'll hate this one. The script, plot, and music are all terrible. About the only thing you'll enjoy is Disney's classic animation.It looks like the storywriters were trying to write the ""New Age Gospel"" for kids and decided to use Balto and his daughter as the missionaries. If you're gonna do that at least give it a decent plot. Example: That little mouse that sings a song -- and a poorly-written song at that. It's entirely new-age-ish and doesn't really help the plot along at all.Where the first movie was based on a true story, this one doesn't contain one scrap of truth. While that's okay for a film, it sure is a disappointment to those of us expecting a true extension to the story.If your local library has a copy, maybe that's worth looking it, but don't waste your money. Buy the first movie instead."
3,Where is the end????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:@,"Right! i have alot of things to write!i like songs in Balto 2! ""Who are you"" and ""Great Design"" are amazing!!!! Animation is worse, that in balto 1:(! This is a good thing. Where is a real quest?! Only one day of wandering! Yeeeep! I HATE ALEU! it is so unfair to make her straight a leader of a wolf pack! I thing, Aleu is a negative character! She is stubborn, annoying everybody all the movie(expecially me), mean to everybody! Aleu ruins all the movie! And also, where is the end of the movie?! Wolfes have gone, Balto went home!Do yo find sence in it?! I dont! We dont know, what happened with wolfes, Aleu, other characters! I can only say - I AM AGAINST BALTO 2, ALEU!"
1,An Insult To A True Hero,"""Balto"" was a movie based on one of the most heroic animals in history. This is just a movie about a mut trying to be a leader. How dare they screw up the true stary for money! I am sorry if this does not really seem like a review, but still, I wanted to give shout about it."
5,Good Movie,"I think this movie was quite good despite all the negative reviews. I don't understand what some people were expecting from this sequel. I understand the first movie was based on a heroic canid but how closely did you want the sequel to follow that dogs life? Balto sits around and then dies...that would be a great movie right? That would be accuracy for you. This movie fosters respect for the earth and the creatures in it. I'm Catholic and I can't understand why other Christians would have a problem with their children learning to respect God's creations. I'll admit the animation had its problems and the songs could be a little hit or miss but overall this was a great movie with a good story and good morals. Oh and one last note, the parents who complained about Balto's daughter's attitude should really have finished the movie to see how the young girl grew"
2,A bad Disney ripoff.,"I am pretty sure most of us has seen this film when it was released in 1998 as The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride, and back then, it was way better. As a couple of other reviewers have already pointed out, there are similarities between this film and L.K. II in almost every spot. Why do I give it two stars you ask? The characters were very interesting and likable, plus their voice work is very well done, but the ripped off story is what really brings this film down. Ignore this and the next follow-up Wings Of Change, and stick withe the original Balto, which is a all time classic."
2,"Balto II, ok for little kids","Balto II: Wolf QuestThe good: Songs are well composed. Mild story plot that will fit the minds of little ones.The bad: Cheesy animation (the movments are sometimes awkward and jerky. The some computer animation do not blend well with the hand-drawn). Very weak story and plot. Awful conclusion that will leave you ""That's it?!"" and ""Why did that happen?"".Balto II Wolf Quest is a movie that only children 3-9 will love. I don't see it as a very good movie unlike the first one, Balto. If you want something for the kids, this is an ok pick. But I don't recommend it for older audiances."
3,Not for young children,"I believe this movie is a bit too ""deep"" for most children. I don't think they will understand what the movie is trying to get across to the audience and by the time they would understand the meaning of this movie, they won't want to watch an animated movie. My almost 3-year-old grandson would not sit still to watch this movie, but would watch the original Balto. Otherwise, it was a fairly entertaining movie and one that kept your attention (if you were older!)."
1,Um yeah....no.,"Why do these companies insist on copying Disney's stupid idea to make OVA sequals to all of their best(and worst) movies. The original Balto was a great and wonderful feature that told a true story and held its self well enough on its own. What I don't understand is why they felt they had to tarnish the film's reputation with cheesy animation, bad voice acting, rediculous diologue, and bad musical numbers. That's right, Universal went and added one song sequence after another with this mess of a film. If you like cheaply made sequels to great films then you'll enjoy this one. But if you want to see a better movie, watch anything else."
4,Not as good as original but still alright.......,"I recently saw this movie today on Cartoon Network and it was alright. The animation was not that bad but some scenes looked very odd....Wolves have always been my favorite animal so this fact bumped my rating of 3 stars to 4. I would not recommed investing $19 on this movie.....try to find it for $10 or less or wait to see it on cartoon network or toon disney.......One final rant....This is not a 'new age' movie that many people seem to label it. It was made to explore the Native American culture and their beliefs about spirit animal guides, totems which have been around for thousands of years shared by many other cultures...so how it is labeled a 'new age' film is strange to me.....and to all the bible pushers out there, is it so wrong to explore the ideas and beliefs of other cultures? Its very sad how some people can be closed minded. Sure this movie is not the best but it should not get written off because of its theme around spirit animals."
1,A-loo,"One word..This film is holy carp!What happened, a fantastic film ruined by a cheesy off topic, money making pile of poo!! How? The animation is CARP, the music is CARP etc. It is a cheaply made copy of tlk2. Disapearing animals, magical spirits, and a theatre (or something) inside a cave! The plot is weird ok.. If a husky and a half wolf have puppies how can there daughtter be a wolf? Precisley! She can't, also if a mutt howls, how does that make her a wolf? She looks like her father,and everyone would want to adopt a daughter of a hero! She looks like a husky anywho. ( who has ever seen a red husky?)Overall its pretty rubbish. Oh yeah when ""a-loo"" becomes leader of the wolf pack she'll probably get them all shot by hunters as she thinks they might ""wanna adopt her!""Rent it 1st for your money's sake!"
1,A Lesson in Earth Worship,"If you want to get your children catechised in Earth Worship using characters from a prequel, this is the movie for you. Rather than enjoying a movie with a sensible theme (adolescent daughter rebelling against her father...though that is hardly sensible), you are given a lesson in Earth worship with praises to 'Father, Son and Sister Moon'. We fast-forwarded through half of this crock.Please, let the parents instruct their children in religion. Movie-Makers, stay out, mind your business and give us a story."
1,1 Word: Craptacular,"This sequal is horrible! Background animation: good. Character animation: TERRIBLE! I didn't even know it was Balto at the beginning, and they made Aniu look horrible compared to the Aniu in the original. The skies are real-the animators where too cheap to make an effort to paint skies. The replacement voices: WAY OFF! And Balto 2 was a musical! Balto wasn't! And the movie has bloopers on every frame. One more thing, the story was unrealistic! The only good that comes out of the movie is the puppies and Nava. Nava was awesome. the pups: Aleu, Saba, Ruby, Kodi, Dingo, and Yukon, were cute. Oh, and the soundtrack was beautiful."
4,Awsome!,"As a kid, well...""teen"" I loved this movie! It had this deep kind of feeling to it. Alue, the main character, must find out her destiny- with the help of her dad!I loved the song Muru sang. (Call me odd, go ahead!) The whole scence was beautiful!"
3,ok,the person who said it ws better than the first balto movie is nutsthe first one is a classic and a true story. the second one is not.the second one ig good but not nearly as good as the first
2,A real disappointment compared with the first Balto movie,"My daughter adores the first Balto movie, and I'll admit that I never tire of it either; in my opinion, it's one of the best children's animated films around. If you feel the same way, you'll probably be disappointed with Balto II: Wolf Quest. The animation is different and not quite as good, and the voices are different, and even the characters are depicted with less finesse, so none of the characters look, act, or sound quite ""right"", compared with the first movie. Even the premise of the movie seems inconsistent with the first movie; Balto is portrayed as a self-loathing outcast, whereas one of the strengths of the first movie is the subtle, natural way it shows Balto coming to accept the positive aspects of being half wolf. Balto II lays out its morals with a much heavier hand, as well; you can practically hear the clunking of the plot as it unfolds. I don't think I'd even recommend renting this video, let alone buying it."
3,"Nowhere as good as the original, but still fun","For those of you who are offended by the 'humanistic' and 'naturalistic' content of this film, please get a life. Respect for nature does not equal evil, and if you want to pick, then watch it WITH your children and guide them. That's what parents are supposed to do.That having been said, The movie's plot IS cookiecutter, the animation was good for a D2V sequel, and the color scheme for the characters was wrong. For example, Balto's eyes changed color between the first film and now. Who knows why?The original voice cast was almost all unavailable for the sequel, each person being involved in various other projects, which is why most of them didn't come back. As for others, maybe they know that D2V sequels in general are lower quality and didn't want their name associated with it?Overall, I was pleased, but that's because I tend to read things into movies that they lack, and so I don't find them as lacking. I'm nuts. :)"
